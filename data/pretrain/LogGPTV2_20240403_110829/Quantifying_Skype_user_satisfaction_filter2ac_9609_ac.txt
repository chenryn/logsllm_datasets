the most used procedure for modeling the relationship be-
tween factors and censored outcomes. In the Cox model, we
treat QoS factors, e.g., the bit rate, as risk factors or co-
variates; in other words, as variables that can cause failures.
In this model, the hazard function of each session is decided
completely by a baseline hazard function and the risk factors
related to that session. We deﬁne the risk factors of a session
as a risk vector Z. The regression equation is deﬁned as
h(t|Z) = h0(t) exp(βtZ) = h0(t) exp(
βkZk),
(1)
pX
k=1
where h(t|Z) is the hazard rate at time t for a session with
risk vector Z; h0(t) is the baseline hazard function computed
during the regression process; and β = (β1, . . . , βp)t is the
coeﬃcient vector that corresponds to the impact of risk fac-
tors. Dividing both sides of Equation 1 by h0(t) and taking
the logarithm, we obtain
h(t|Z)
h0(t)
log
= β1Z1 + ··· + βkZk =

βkZk = βtZ,
(2)
where Zp is the pth factor of the session. The right side of
Equation 2 is a linear combination of covariates with weights
set to the respective regression coeﬃcients, i.e., it is trans-
formed into a linear regression equation. The Cox model
possesses the property that, if we look at two sessions with
(cid:3)
risk vectors Z and Z
, the hazard ratio (ratio of their hazard
rates) is

which is a time-independent constant, i.e., the hazard ratio
of the two sessions is independent of time. For this reason
the Cox model is often called the proportional hazards model.
On the other hand, Equation 3 imposes the strictest condi-
tions when applying the Cox model, because the validity of
the model relies on the assumption that the hazard rates for
any two sessions must be in proportion all the time.
4.4.2 Collinearity among Factors
Although we can simply put all potential QoS factors into
a regression model, the result would be ambiguous if the
predictors were strongly interrelated [7]. Now that we have
seven factors, namely, the bit rate (br), packet rate (pr),
jitter, pr.jitter, packet size (pktsize), and round-trip times
(rtt), we explain why not all of them can be included in the
model simultaneously.
Table 3 provides the directions and levels of interrelation
between each pair of factors, where the p-value is computed
by Kendall’s τ statistic as the pairs are not necessarily de-
rived from a bivariate normal distribution. However, Pear-
son’s product moment statistic yields similar results. We
ﬁnd that 1) the bit rate, packet rate, and packet size are
strongly interrelated; and 2) jitter and packet rate jitter are
strongly interrelated. By comparing the regression coeﬃ-
cients when correlated variables are added or deleted, we
ﬁnd that the interrelation among QoS factors is very strong
so that variables in the same collinear group could interfere
with each other. To obtain an interpretable model, only one
variable in each collinear group can remain. As a result,
only the bit rate, jitter, and RTT are retained in the model,
as the ﬁrst two are the most signiﬁcant predictors compared
with their interrelated variables.
4.4.3
Sampling of QoS Factors
In the regression modeling, we use a scalar value for each
risk factor to capture user perceived quality. QoS factors,
such as the round-trip delay time, however, are usually not
constant, but vary during a call. To extract a representative
value for each factor in a session, which is resemble to feature
vector extraction in pattern recognition, will be a key to how
well the model can describe the observed sessions.
Intuitively, the values averaged across the whole session
time would be a good choice. However, extreme conditions
may have much more inﬂuence on user behavior than or-
dinary conditions. For example, users may hang up a call
earlier because of serious network lags in a short period, but
be insensitive to mild and moderate lags that occur all the
time. To derive the most representative risk vector, we pro-
pose three measures to account for network quality, namely,
the minimum, the average, and the maximum, by two-level
sampling. That is, the original series s is ﬁrst divided into
sub-series of length w, from which network conditions are
sampled. This sub-series approach conﬁnes measure of net-
work quality within time spans of w, thus excludes the eﬀect
of large-scale variations. The minimum, average, and max-
imum measures are then taken from sampled QoS factors
which has length (cid:3)|s|/w(cid:4). One of the three measures will
be chosen depending on their ability to describe the user
perceived experience during a call.
We evaluate all kinds of measures and window sizes by
ﬁtting the extracted QoS factors into the Cox model and
comparing the model’s log-likelihood, i.e., an indicator of
goodness-of-ﬁt. Finally, the maximum bit rate and mini-
mum jitter are chosen, both sampled with a window of 30
seconds. The short time window implies that users are more
sensitive to short-term, rather than long-term, behavior of
network quality, as the latter may have no inﬂuence on voice
quality at all. The sampling of the bit rate, jitter, and RTT
consistently chooses the value that represents the best quality
a user experienced. This interesting ﬁnding may be further
veriﬁed by cognitive models that could determine whether

4.4.4 Model Fitting
For a continuous variable, the Cox model assumes a linear
relationship between the covariates and the hazard function,
i.e., it implies that the ratio of risks between a 20 Kbps- and
a 30 Kbps-bit rate session is the same as that between a 40
Kbps- and 50 Kbps-bit rate session. Thus, to proceed with
the Cox model, we must ensure that our predictors have a
linear inﬂuence on the hazard functions.
We investigate the impact of the covariates on the hazard
functions with the following equation:
Z ∞
E[si] = exp(βtf (Z))
0
I(ti (cid:2) s)h0(s)ds,
(4)
where si is the censoring status of session i, and f (z) is
the estimated functional form of the covariate z. This cor-
responds to a Poisson regression model if h0(s) is known,
where the value of h0(s) can be approximated by simply ﬁt-
ting a Cox model with unadjusted covariates. We can then
ﬁt the Poisson model with smoothing spline terms for each
covariate [13]. If the covariate has a linear impact on the
hazard functions, the smoothed terms will approximate a
straight line.
In Fig. 6(a), we plot the ﬁtted splines, as well as their
two-standard-error conﬁdence bands, for the bit rate factor.
From the graph, we observe that the inﬂuence of the bit
rate is not proportional to its magnitude (note the change
of slope around 35 Kbps); thus, modeling this factor as
linear would not provide a good ﬁt. A solution for non-
proportional variables is scale transformation. As shown in
Fig. 6(b), the logarithmic variable, br.log, has a smoother
and approximately proportional inﬂuence on the failure rate.
This indicates that the failure rate is proportional to the
scale of the bit rate, rather than its magnitude. A similar

situation occurs with the jitter factor, i.e., the factor also
has a non-linear impact, but its impact is approximately lin-
ear by taking logarithms, as shown in Fig. 7. On the other
hand, the RTT factor has an approximate linear impact so
that there is no need to adjust for it.
We employ a more generalized Cox model that allows
time-dependent coeﬃcients [13] to check the proportional
hazard assumption by hypothesis tests. After adjustment,
none of covariates reject the linearity hypothesis at signiﬁ-
cance level 0.1, i.e., the transformed variables have an ap-
proximate linear impact on the hazard functions. In addi-
tion, we use the Cox and Snell residuals ri (for session i) to
assess the overall goodness-of-ﬁt of the model [4]. We ﬁnd
that, except for a few sessions that have unusual call du-
ration, most sessions ﬁt the model very well; therefore, the
adequacy of the ﬁtted model is conﬁrmed.
4.4.5 Model Interpretation
The regression coeﬃcients, β, along with their standard
errors and signiﬁcance values of the ﬁnal model are listed
in Table 4. Contrasting them with Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 re-
veals that the coeﬃcients βbr.log and βjitter.log are simply
the slopes in the linear regression of the covariate versus
the hazard function. β can be physically interpreted by
the hazard ratios (Equation 3). For example, assuming
two Skype users call their friends at the same time with
similar bit rates and round-trip times to the receivers, but

the jitters they experience are 1 Kbps and 2 Kbps respec-
tively, the hazard ratio of the two calls can be computed by
exp((log(2) − log(1)) × βjitter.log) ≈ 2.9. That is, as long as
both users are still talking, in every instant, the probability
that user 2 will hang up is 2.9 times the probability that
user 1 will do so.
The model can also be used to quantify the relative in-
ﬂuence of QoS factors. Knowing which factors have more
impact than others is beneﬁcial, as it helps assign resources
appropriately to derive the maximum marginal eﬀect in im-
proving users’ perceived quality. We cannot simply treat β
as the relative impact of factors because they have diﬀerent
