ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
I owe thanks to many for the discussions and input to this talk.  In 
particular,  I  wish 
the 
Pennsylvania State University for input on privacy research in the 
social sciences. 
BIO 
Dr.  Clifton  works  on  data  privacy,  particularly  with  respect  to 
analysis  of  private  data.  This  includes  privacy-preserving  data 
mining,  data  de-identification  and  anonymization,  and  limits  on 
identifying individuals from data  mining models. He also works 
more  broadly  in  data  mining,  including  data  mining  of  text  and 
data mining techniques applied to interoperation of heterogeneous 
information  sources.  Fundamental  data  mining  challenges  posed 
by  these  applications  include  extracting  knowledge  from  noisy 
data, identifying knowledge in highly skewed data (few examples 
of "interesting" behavior), and limits on learning. He also works 
on  database  support  for  widely  distributed  and  autonomously 
controlled information, particularly issues related to data privacy. 
Prior to joining Purdue, Dr. Clifton 
was  a  principal  scientist  in  the 
Information Technology Division at 
the  MITRE  Corporation.  Before 
joining MITRE in 1995, he was an 
assistant  professor  of  computer 
science at Northwestern University.  
ABSTRACT 
The  computer  science  community  has  had  a  growing  research 
focus  in  Privacy  over  the  last  decade.    Much  of  this  has  really 
focused  on  confidentiality: 
  Anonymization,  computing  on 
encrypted data, access control policy, etc.  This talk will look at a 
variety  of  research  results  in  this  area,  including  “weaker” 
approaches than the absolutes typically considered in the security 
community,  and  how  they  all  come  down  to  the  same  basic 
concept of providing confidentiality. 
Privacy is much more complex.  People are often willing to allow 
use of their data – but not just for anything.  This talk will look at 
such other privacy issues, such as harm to individuals and society 
from the fear of disclosure or misuse of private data.  The talk will 
conclude with ideas for new research directions in privacy.
