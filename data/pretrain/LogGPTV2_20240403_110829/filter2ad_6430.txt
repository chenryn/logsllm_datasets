## Acknowledgements

I am grateful to many individuals for their valuable discussions and contributions to this presentation. I would especially like to thank Dr. Heng Xu from Pennsylvania State University for her insights into privacy research in the social sciences.

## Biography

Dr. Clifton specializes in data privacy, particularly in the analysis of private data. His research encompasses privacy-preserving data mining, data de-identification and anonymization, and the limitations on identifying individuals from data mining models. Additionally, he explores broader areas in data mining, including text mining and the application of data mining techniques to the interoperability of heterogeneous information sources. Key challenges in these applications include extracting knowledge from noisy data, identifying patterns in highly skewed datasets, and understanding the limits of learning. Dr. Clifton also focuses on database support for widely distributed and autonomously controlled information, with a particular emphasis on data privacy issues.

Before joining Purdue, Dr. Clifton served as a principal scientist in the Information Technology Division at the MITRE Corporation. Prior to that, he was an assistant professor of computer science at Northwestern University.

## Abstract

Over the past decade, the computer science community has seen a growing focus on privacy research. Much of this work has centered on confidentiality, including topics such as anonymization, computing on encrypted data, and access control policies. This talk will explore various research findings in this area, including "weaker" approaches compared to the absolute measures typically considered in the security community, and how they all ultimately aim to provide confidentiality.

However, privacy is a much more complex issue. People often consent to the use of their data, but not without restrictions. This talk will address other privacy concerns, such as the potential harm to individuals and society from the fear of data disclosure or misuse. The presentation will conclude with suggestions for new research directions in privacy.
