ABSTRACT
In distributed systems users need the ability to share sensitive con-
tent with multiple other recipients based on their ability to satisfy
arbitrary policies. One such system is electricity grids where ﬁne-
grained sensor data sharing holds the potential for increased relia-
bility and efﬁciency. However, effective data sharing requires tech-
nical solutions that support ﬂexible access policies, for example,
sharing more data when the grid is unstable. In such systems, both
the messages and policies are sensitive and, therefore, they need to
kept be secret. Furthermore, to allow for such a system to be se-
cure and usable in the presence of untrusted object stores and relays
it must be resilient in the presence of active adversaries and pro-
vide efﬁcient key management. While several of these properties
have been studied in the past we address a new problem in the area
of policy based encryption in that we develop a solution with all
of these capabilities. We develop a Policy and Key Encapsulation
Mechanism − Data Encapsulation Mechanism (PKEM-DEM) en-
cryption scheme that is a generic construction secure against adap-
tive chosen ciphertext attacks and develop a Policy Based Encryp-
tion System (PBES) using this scheme that provides these capa-
bilities. We provide an implementation of PBES and measure its
performance.

work we develop a Policy Based Encryption System (PBES) that is
driven by a real-world, large-scale, policy-based data sharing prob-
lem. The problem we look at is data sharing in the electric power
grid where power system operators need to cooperate with each
other to operate the grid safely and reliably but they also compete
with each other as business entities. Increasing power consump-
tion and major recent events such as the August 2003 blackout [40]
means the system operators are compelled to share sensitive data
to improve the reliability of the grid through wide area measure-
ment, monitoring and control. In deregulated grids worldwide and
in the North American grid in particular, utilities share sensitive
data with their local Independent Systems Operators (ISOs) as re-
quired by regulatory laws. However, they might not be comfort-
able disclosing sensitive data to other entities except under certain
conditions including transient conditions in the grid at the time of
access. For example, Utility A might be willing to share certain
data, 1) with some utilities right away while with others only af-
ter four hours have elapsed since the data is generated or 2) with
any Utility X under the jurisdiction of ISO B during a frequency
or voltage disturbance. In many cases it is the context-based pol-
icy that drives the data sharing while the number or recipients or
their identities may not be known in advance. Interestingly, it is not
just the data that is sensitive but also the policies for sharing the
data. For example, if the second policy rule in the example above
involving the context of a major transmission disturbance were to
be in clear-text then anyone observing signiﬁcant network trafﬁc
with that policy might be able to conclude that a major event has
occurred. This could result in negative publicity, loss of market rev-
enue or an increase in attacks for Utility A. In general, policies may
be sensitive because they directly contain sensitive information, re-
veal information about underlying data protected by the policy or
reveal information about the data owner or the data recipients.
An effective approach for addressing requirements for the power
grid data sharing problem requires techniques that go beyond the
capabilities of today’s solutions in the area. Speciﬁcally, there is
a need for policy-based data encryption techniques that support
1) multiple recipients, 2) data and policy secrecy and 3) context-
based policy enforcement. Furthermore, in order to be practical,
techniques with these properties must be efﬁcient (in terms of key
management), support ﬂexible policy speciﬁcations, be secure in
the presence of active adversaries, and be compatible with exist-
ing distributed networking and systems technologies. Past work
in this area has addressed only a subset of these problems. Iden-
tity Based Encryption (IBE) [11] systems and policy-based crypto-
graphic schemes proposed in [2, 9] allow the association of a ﬂex-
ible policy with objects and support exchange in open distributed
systems but do not keep the policy secret and are designed for two-
party communication where the sender identiﬁes the recipient in
the encryption. Several works in the area of “hidden policies and
credentials” [12,23,31] provide message and policy secrecy but fo-
cus on two-party interactions. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE)
system such as Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE) [10, 14], policy-
based cryptographic scheme [8] and cryptographic ﬁle system FS-
Guard [37] allow the association of ﬂexible policies with objects for
multiple recipients deﬁned by those policies and support exchange
in open distributed systems but do not provide policy secrecy. [8] is
also vulnerable to collusion attacks. Recent work by [34] extends
CP-ABE to support policy secrecy but signiﬁcantly limits it’s pol-
icy ﬂexibility and does not support context-based policies. PEA-
POD [30] focuses on one-to-many messaging with both message
and policy secrecy but does not provide efﬁcient key management
and is also vulnerable to collusion attacks.
Our Contribution In this work we develop an application-
independent Policy Based Encryption System (PBES) that pro-
poses a solution to this new problem of providing all of the above-
mentioned properties and then use the solution to design an ef-
fective power grid data sharing application. We ﬁrst build a new
encryption scheme PKEM-DEM (Policy and Key Encapsulation
Mechanism - Data Encapsulation Mechanism) for encrypting ob-
jects and policies and show that it is secure against adaptive cho-
sen ciphertext attacks in the random oracle model. The encryp-
tion scheme builds on recent work in KEM-DEM hybrid encryption
schemes [15]. In addition to the notions of message indistinguish-
ability and policy indistinguishability we deﬁne and prove a new
notion of pairwise indistinguishability where adversaries need to
distinguish between pairs of messages and policies1. We then use
this scheme to construct the PBES system that provides the three
properties mentioned above. For decryption PBES utilizes trusted
Key Distribution Centers (KDC)s that mediate decryption of ob-
jects for recipients and enforce the policies associated with the ob-
jects. We leverage the KDCs for policy enforcement and provide
very efﬁcient key management as well as immediate revocation.
We discuss how PBES can address the requirements of the power
grid data sharing application and study design issues for developing
applications in general; e.g., key distribution and placement of trust
in KDCs. We also implement a prototype toolkit to demonstrate its
feasibility and reasonable performance.
PBES employs trusted key servers and from a systems perspec-
tive this approach is reasonable for regulated environments such as
the power grid; in fact, the grid regularly uses trusted servers for
ensuring reliability and security. In terms of encryption techniques
this design approach ﬁrst made it seem like the solution might be
easy, however, it turned out that was not the case. We looked at
leading Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Role-Based Access Con-
trol (RBAC) and secure publish/subscribe systems that typically
employ trusted servers for mediated access control but were un-
able to satisfy the requirements. Speciﬁcally, the requirements for
policy secrecy and context-based policy enforcement could not be
satisﬁed. PBES satisﬁes these requirements and also provides ef-
ﬁciency, security and ﬂexibility. We show that with its unique
properties PBES can naturally address the data sharing needs of
the power grid. To that end, we identify actors, applications and
processes for data sharing in the grid. While we focus primarily on
the power grid, PBES is suitable for many large-scale systems that
share features with the power grid. Regulated environments such
as medical and ﬁnancial information systems often employ trusted
mediators that share environmental features like the power grid;
examples of trusted entities include Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) in the public health domain and the Securi-

ties and Exchange Commission in the ﬁnancial domain. Even out-
side regulated domains suitable application domains include those
where domains have partial trust or provide auditing capabilities of
the services provided by the trusted servers.

2. BACKGROUND
The North American electric power grid is a highly intercon-
nected system hailed as one of the greatest engineering feats of
the 20th century. However, increasing demand for electricity and
an aging infrastructure are putting increasing pressure on the reli-
ability and safety of the grid as witnessed in recent blackouts [16,
40]. Furthermore, deregulation of the power industry has moved
it away from vertically integrated centralized operations to coor-
dinated decentralized operations. Reliability Coordinators (RCs)
such as Independent System Operators (ISOs) or Regional Trans-
mission Operators (RTOs) are tasked by Federal Energy Regula-
tion Commission (FERC) and North American Electric Reliability
Council (NERC) with overseeing reliable operation of the grid and
providing reliability coordination and oversight over a wide area.
Balancing Authorities (BAs) are tasked with balancing load, gener-
ation and scheduled interchange in real-time in a given Balancing
Authority Area (BAA). BAA is a geographic area where a single
entity balances generation and loads in real-time to maintain reli-
able operation. BAA are the primary operational entities that are
subject to NERC regulatory standards for reliability. Every gener-
ator, transmission facility, and end-use customer is in a BAA.
Currently, sensor readings from substations in utilities2 are sent
via a communication network to the Supervisory Control And Data
Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the local BA that controls the
system and to the RC that oversees reliable operation of the system.
There are operations taking place at various time granularities to
keep the power system stable and reliable. Among the frequent

tities in a broad sense including generator owners/operators, trans-
mission owners/operators, distributors and load serving entities

at the granularity of milliseconds, state estimators and contingency
analysis in BAs and RCs operate at the granularilty of minutes and
hourly and day ahead power markets run by RCs operate at the
granularity of hour and day respectively.
In order to improve the reliability of the power grid while meet-
ing the increased power demand, the industry is moving towards
wide-area measurement, monitoring and control. The Department
of Energy (DOE), NERC and electric utility companies formed the
North American SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI) (www.naspi.
org) with a vision to improve the reliability of the power grid
through wide area measurement, monitoring and control. It’s mis-
sion is to create a robust, widely available and secure synchro-
nized data measurement infrastructure with associated monitoring
and analysis tools for better planning and reliable operation of the
power grid. NASPI envisions deployment of hundreds of thousands
of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) across the grid that pump
data at 30 samples/second to hundreds of applications in approx-
imately 140 BAAs across the country. PMUs are clock synchro-
nized (through GPS) sensors that can read current and voltage pha-
sors at a substation bus on the transmission power network. Phasor
Data Concentrators (PDCs) at substations or control centers time
align the data from multiple PMUs before sending them to applica-
tions. PMUs give direct access to the state of the grid at any given
instant in contrast to having to estimate the state as is done today.
Figure 1 shows a high-level architecture envisioned for PMUs. Ap-
plications envisioned to utilize this data have varying requirements.
Open loop control applications like state estimation have critical
time alignment requirements while post event analysis applications
like disturbance analysis have critical accuracy and message rate
requirements. Feedback control applications like transient stabil-
ity control have critical latency, availability, accuracy, message rate
and time alignment requirements [17].
While utilities are currently mandated to share operational data
with their local BA and RC (ISO or RTO) they are not required or
expected to share data with other utilities. This is because, while
the utilities have to cooperate with each other to operate the grid
safely and reliably they are also business competitors. Further-
more, this data can reveal a ﬁne grained view of a utilities network
and the current state of that network. In the wrong hands the for-
mer can make the utility a target of attacks and the latter can affect
the wholesale electricity markets and as a consequence the utility
itself adversely. Another consideration hampering data sharing is
the concern of utilities that they might open themselves up for con-
tinuous compliance monitoring. However there is mutual beneﬁt
in sharing PMU data widely as it will help in operating the grid
safely and reliably and in avoiding overloading, outages, brown-
outs and blackouts [16, 40]. Sharing PMU data will also help in
