# Reverse-Engineering 4G Hotspots: A Journey of Fun, Bugs, and Financial Loss

## Introduction
I am a hardware security researcher at Pen Test Partners, with extensive experience in analyzing and testing routers and modems. I have earned several certifications and discovered multiple Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) to demonstrate my expertise. Last year, I also explored the BitFi hacking challenge. I often use pseudonyms for my work.

### Today's Topic
Today, we will discuss 4G hotspots, also known as cellular routers. The agenda includes:
1. Why cellular routers?
2. Attack surface and threat model.
3. Case study: ZTE MF910.
4. Case study: Netgear Nighthawk M1.
5. Conclusions and future implications.

## Why Cellular Routers?
Cellular routers are becoming increasingly popular due to their convenience and reliability. As 5G technology rolls out, more consumers and businesses will rely on cellular networks for daily TCP/IP connectivity. This trend will lead to a proliferation of modems, dongles, and routers. However, there has been limited public scrutiny of consumer cellular networking gear, making it an interesting area for security research.

### Key Points
- Limited vendors in the cellular router market.
- Significant code reuse in the industry.
- All computers, including routers, are prone to bugs.

## Cellular Basics
Modern cellular routers support TCP/UDP/IP over cellular networks, but this is not inherently secure. Access Point Names (APNs) function similarly to a LAN you do not control. While some APNs are well-configured, others may be poorly managed, leaving users exposed.

### APN Security
A well-configured APN (private/M2M/IoT-specific) may include:
- Client segregation
- Outbound web filtering/proxy
- Internal DNS
- IMEI filtering
- IMEI/ICCID pair filtering
- Anomalous behavior detection
- Other security measures typical of private corporate networks

However, these features are not always implemented, leading to potential security risks.

## Higher-Risk Attack Surface (Actual Bugs)
- **Web Configuration Interface**: Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if exposed to the WAN.
- **Client-Side (CSRF)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) can lead to RCE.
- **TCP/UDP Services**: RCE via vulnerabilities in these services.
- **SMS/MMS**: RCE if the attacker knows the phone number.

## Lower-Risk Attack Surface (Not Really Bugs)
- **Physical Access**: Methods to gain access or extract information, such as:
  - USB
  - Flash memory
  - Bootloader
  - UART
  - JTAG/SWD
  - Proprietary interfaces

These methods are more useful for researchers than they are risky for everyday users.

## What I Want from a Router
- **External Threats**: No unauthorized access.
- **Bad JavaScript**: No CSRF attacks.
- **Shell Access**: I want to have a shell on my own router for legitimate reasons, such as finding bugs.

## Generic Router Hacking Methodology
1. **Research**: Understand what has been done before on similar devices.
2. **Firmware Acquisition**: Obtain the firmware, or similar firmware if not available.
3. **Exploitation and Bug Hunting**: Gain shell access and find vulnerabilities (or vice versa).

### Case Study: ZTE MF910
#### Overview
- **End of Life**: No longer supported by ZTE.
- **Affordable**: Approximately â‚¬20.
- **Common SoC**: Qualcomm MDM9225, widely used.
- **Vendor**: ZTE, a major player in the market.

#### Caveats
- **Potential Zero-Days**: ZTE's poor triage process means there might be unpatched vulnerabilities.
- **Vendor Response**: ZTE's end-of-life policy does not include public announcements unless requested by customers.

#### Hardware Highlights
- **SoC**: Qualcomm MDM9225.
- **Memory**: JSC JSFCBB3Y7ABBD Combination NAND/RAM.
- **Test Pads**: Convenient for hardware analysis.
- **Interface**: Micro USB.

#### Known Vulnerabilities
- **ADB Mode**: Unauthenticated root shell over USB.
- **Default Password**: "zte9x15" set on boot.
- **iptables Rules**: Default ACCEPT policy with some port blocking.
- **Active Connections**: Various services running, including SSH, Telnet, and HTTP.

### System Architecture
- **Linux Kernel**: Version 3.4.0+.
- **Stock Binaries**: Includes debug binaries and Qualcomm DIAG test tools.
- **Security Measures**: Some iptables rules, but not comprehensive.

## Conclusion
The security landscape for 4G and 5G cellular routers is evolving, and there is a need for more rigorous public scrutiny. Vendors like ZTE should improve their end-of-life policies and patch management to protect users. As 5G adoption increases, the importance of securing these devices will only grow.
