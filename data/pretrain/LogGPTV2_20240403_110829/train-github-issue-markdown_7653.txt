The PHP error encountered is as follows:

```
PHP Fatal error: Call to a member function getRepository() on a non-object
```

Despite being in the development environment (using `app_dev.php`), this error is suppressed, and a blank page is displayed.

### Steps to Replicate:
1. Remove the following line from any CRUD action in your controller:
   ```php
   $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
   ```

By doing so, the `EntityManager` object (`$em`) will not be initialized, leading to the fatal error when attempting to call `getRepository()` on a non-object.
