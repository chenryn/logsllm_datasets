sizes. Observe that the in-degree distribution for the measured data
has an exponential decay (note the log-linear scale). Interestingly,
we discover that the distribution is consistent across different sam-
ple sizes. If a straight line is ﬁtted over 99.9% of the distribution
(i.e., ignoring the 0.1% of nodes with the largest in-degrees), the
line has a y-intercept of -0.8565 and a slope of -0.6393. These pa-
rameters can be used to model the nearest-neighbor in-degree dis-
tribution among edge networks in the Internet. In the future, when
delay data for hosts within local area networks become available,
the model can be hierarchically extended by assigning end hosts
appropriately to each edge network in the model.
We classify the nodes into local cluster heads (or star heads) and
non-heads using the procedure described in 3.1. Table 1 shows that
the proportion of nodes in the data that are classiﬁed as local cluster
heads is quite stable across different sample sizes. This observation
is also true when each major global cluster is considered separately.
This property will be useful when we turn to the synthesis of delay
spaces later in this paper.
In contrast, as shown in Figure 3(b), the in-degree distribution
for the Inet topology follows closely the power-law (note the log-
log scale). If a straight line is ﬁtted over 99.9% of the distribution,
the line has a y-intercept of -3.7852 and a slope of -1.3970. Thus,
the Inet model does not reﬂect the local clustering properties among
edge networks in the measured delay data. For the GT-ITM topol-
ogy, as shown in Figure 3(c), the distribution is close to exponen-
tial, the best ﬁt line in the log-linear plot has y-intercept of -0.0080
and slope of -1.1611. Thus, this distribution is also different from
that found in the measured data.
Next we analyze spatial growth. Figure 4(a) shows the median
B(2r)/B(r) growth of the data sets. We plot the median because,
unlike the mean, it is insensitive to the extreme outliers and can bet-
ter characterize the dominant trends. As can be seen, the topology
models have far higher peak spatial growth than the measured data
(note the log-linear scale) and have very different trends.
In the
measured data, the initial growth is higher when the ball is expand-
ing within a major cluster. As soon as the ball radius covers most
of the nodes within the same major cluster, growth slows down as
expected. When the ball radius reaches a size that begins to cover
another major cluster, the growth increases again. Eventually most
of the nodes are covered by the ball and the growth ratio steadily
drops to one. This growth trend in the measured data is invariant
across different sample sizes. These new ﬁndings can help ﬁne tune
distributed system algorithms that are sensitive to the ball growth
rate. On the other hand, the growth trends in the Inet and GT-ITM
topology models do not reﬂect the structure of the measured data.
In terms of the D(k) metric, we also observe dramatic differ-
ences between topology models and the measured data. Figure 4(b)
indicates that in the Inet and GT-ITM topology models, from the
perspective of an observer node, there are very few nodes whose
delays are substantially smaller than the overall average delay. In
contrast, in the measured data, from an observer node, we can ﬁnd
many more nodes whose delays are substantially smaller than the

For each edge ij, we count the number of Type 1 violations it
causes. To illustrate how the number of triangle inequality viola-
tions are distributed over the major clusters, we present a matrix
in Figure 5 for the measured data. To produce this ﬁgure, we ﬁrst
reorganize the original data matrix by grouping nodes in the same
clusters together. The top left corner has indices (0,0). The matrix
indices of the nodes in the largest cluster (North America) are the
smallest, the indices for nodes in the second largest cluster (Eu-
rope) are next, then the indices for nodes in the third largest cluster
(Asia), followed by indices for nodes that did not get classiﬁed into
any of the 3 major clusters.
Each point (i, j) in the plot represents the number of Type 1
violations that the edge ij is involved in as a shade of gray. A
black point indicates no violation and a white point indicates the
maximum number of violations encountered for any edge in the
analysis. Missing values in the matrix are drawn as white points.
It is immediately apparent that clustering is very useful for classi-
fying triangle inequality violations. It can be seen that edges within
the same cluster (i.e. the 3 blocks along the diagonal) tend to have
signiﬁcantly fewer Type 1 violations (darker) than edges that cross
clusters (lighter). Also, the number of violations for edges con-
necting a given pair of clusters is quite homogeneous. Note that
the white wavy lines roughly parallel to the diagonal are simply
showing the missing data. Our measurement methodology mea-
sures the data in sequences parallel to the diagonal to evenly spread
the trafﬁc among the probed DNS servers. Thus, when a measure-
ment station fails, an entire diagonal can be missing. The lines are
not straight because whole rows and columns are removed from the
data set if they have more than 25% of the values missing. Due to
space limitations, we do not include the matrix picture for Type 2
violations, but as expected, the relative shades are the reverse of
those in Figure 5. These results imply that, if two nodes are within

Data (white color is most severe).
overall average. Thus, a random probing strategy for ﬁnding a
close-by neighbor would be much more successful in the real In-
ternet than in the Inet and GT-ITM topology models. This is an
example of how using an inadequate delay space model for sim-
ulation can potentially lead to misleading results. Finally, it can
be observed that the D(k) metric is also invariant across different
sample sizes. This empirical D(k) function can be applied to com-
pute the expected delay stretch in the Pastry and Tapestry overlays
when deployed over the global Internet [5].
We next analyze the measured data set with respect to properties
related to triangle inequality violations. We say that an edge ij
in the data set causes a Type 1 triangle inequality violation if for
some node k, dik +dkj
 1. Intuitively, better overlay paths can be found for
edges that cause Type 1 violations, and edges that cause Type 2
violations can potentially provide short-cut overlay paths.

the same major cluster, then the chance of ﬁnding a shorter over-
lay path is far lower then when the nodes are in different clusters.
Moreover, edges that are used to form better overlay paths are most
likely found inside a cluster. Interestingly, observe that it is least
likely to ﬁnd better overlay routes for paths within the Asia cluster,
but it is easiest to ﬁnd better overlay routes for paths across the Asia
and Europe clusters.
We show in Figure 6(a) and Figure 6(b) the cumulative distri-
butions of Type 1 and Type 2 violation ratios for different sample
sizes. Observe that the distribution is very stable across sample
sizes. Intuitively, since triangle inequality violation is an inherent
property of the inefﬁciency of Internet routing, the amount of trian-
gle inequality violations observed is not expected to depend on the
number of data samples. This invariant is useful in synthesizing the
Internet delay space.
3.3 Summary
Our analysis conﬁrms some existing knowledge about the Inter-
net delay space, such as the characteristic delay distribution and
continental clustering. In addition, the analysis provides a number
of new insights:
• The in-degree distribution of the directed nearest neighbor graph
of the measured data resembles an exponential distribution and is
stable across sample sizes. The relative number of local clusters
also appears stable across sample sizes. These ﬁndings can be used
to model local clustering properties in the Internet delay space.
• The ball growth metrics reﬂect the continental clustering struc-
ture of the delay space and the observed growth rate is low. These
properties can inform the design of distributed algorithms, for in-
stance to ﬁnd the nearest neighbor. The D(k) function empirically
derived from the data shows that it is not difﬁcult to encounter a
close-by neighbor by random probing. The function can also be
used to compute the expected delay stretch in structured overlay
networks.
• The potential beneﬁt of overlay routing for a pair of nodes ij
and the utility of the pair for overlay routing can be predicted by
the clusters that i and j belong to.
In particular, it is hardest to
ﬁnd better overlay routes for paths within the Asia cluster, but it is
