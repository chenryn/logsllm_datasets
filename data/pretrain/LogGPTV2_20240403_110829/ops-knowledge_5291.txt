Commonly used Ansible modules include: 1. apt module: used to automate the management of software packages on Ubuntu systems. This module can be used for operations such as installing, upgrading, and removing software packages. 2. copy module: used to copy local files to remote servers. This module is usually used to upload configuration files, keys, etc. to the target server. 3. Service module: used to start, stop, restart, reload and other operational services. This module can automate management services such as web servers, database servers, etc. This makes it easier to manage multiple servers, allowing operations to be performed on multiple servers at the same time. In addition to these modules, Ansible also provides a large number of other modules and plugins that can be used to deal with various types of tasks such as files, networks, software, etc. For operation and maintenance personnel who need to manage multiple servers, using Ansible can manage servers more efficiently and improve work efficiency.
