User: Really frustrated with this as one thing works at one time. Sometimes import filename.py works. But in the tutorials all I see is python filename.py. But when I try to give that, I am facing an error like invalid syntax.
I have edited all the environment variables and I have C:\Python27 folder in the same location. To be able to run the files using python filename.py what are the conditions that must be met? What should be the current working directory? Should the .py files be there in the same working directory?
Assistant: Just to be clear, typing python filename.py only works from the Terminal (i.e. cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell, the "Terminal" application on a Linux kernel, etc.), not from the Python interpreter (i.e. python.exe), and only works if you have used the cd command to change into the directory in which the file is saved (so that the terminal knows where to look for filename.py). import filename can be used from the Python interpreter, but is not the ideal method as it creates a compiled version of filename.py and can only be used once (you would have to restart the interpreter to do so again). I'm not sure whether this works in the official Python distribution available from the Python website, but at least in the Anaconda distribution, you can run a file from the Python interpreter using runfile("C:/Users/CurrentUser/Subfolder/filename.py").
