User: I've installed Miniconda and have added the environment variable export PATH="/home/username/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" to my .bashrc and .bash_profile but still can't run any conda commands in my terminal.
Am I missing another step in my setup? I'm using zsh by the way.
Assistant: It can be a silly mistake, make sure that you use anaconda3 instead of anaconda in the export path if you installed so.
