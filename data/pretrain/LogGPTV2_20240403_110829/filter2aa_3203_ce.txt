### Chapter 16 â€“ Troubleshooting TCP/IP

#### Abstract
This chapter provides a comprehensive guide on how to diagnose and resolve issues related to connectivity, name resolution, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) session creation within Microsoft Windows operating systems. It emphasizes the importance of methodically analyzing TCP/IP-related networking problems through the lens of the various layers of the TCP/IP model and using the appropriate tools to effectively isolate and resolve communication issues in a TCP/IP network.

### Identifying the Problem Source
A structured approach is essential when troubleshooting any issue. Some key questions to ask during the process include:
- What functions are working correctly?
- What is not working?
- How are the functioning and non-functioning components related?
- Have the non-functioning components ever worked before?
- If so, what changes have occurred since they last functioned?

The answers to these questions can help pinpoint where to start troubleshooting, potentially isolating the specific component, layer, or configuration issue causing the problem.

| Ping            | Sends ICMP Echo or ICMPv6 Echo Request messages to test reachability.      |
| Route           | Allows viewing of the IPv4 and IPv6 routing tables and editing of the IPv4 routing table. |
| Tracert         | Sends ICMP Echo or ICMPv6 Echo Request messages to trace the network route taken by IPv4 or IPv6 packets to a specific destination. |
| Pathping        | Sends ICMP Echo or ICMPv6 Echo Request messages to trace the route an IPv4 or IPv6 packet takes to a destination and displays information on packet losses for each router and link in the path. |
| SNMP service    | Provides status and statistical information to Simple Network Management System (SNMP) management systems. |
| Event Viewer    | Records errors and events.                                                  |
| Performance Logs and Alerts | Logs TCP/IP core protocol performance and sends alerts (the SNMP service must be installed). |
| Network Monitor | Captures and displays the contents of TCP/IP packets sent to and from computers. |
| Netdiag         | Runs a series of diagnostics tests on networking components. Installed as part of the Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 Support Tools in the Support\Tools folder of the product CD-ROM. |
| Telnet          | Tests TCP connection establishment between two nodes.                       |
| Ttcp            | Listens for and sends TCP segment data or UDP messages between two nodes. Provided with Windows Server 2003 in the Valueadd\Msft\Net\Tools folder of the product CD-ROM. |

### Troubleshooting IPv4
The following sections detail the tools and techniques used to identify and resolve problems at different layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack for IPv4. Depending on the nature of the problem, you may choose to:
- Start at the bottom of the stack and move up.
- Start at the top of the stack and move down.

These sections are organized from the top of the stack and cover how to:
- Verify IPv4 connectivity.
- Verify DNS name resolution for IPv4 addresses.
- Verify NetBIOS name resolution.
- Verify IPv4-based TCP sessions.

While not detailed in the following sections, Network Monitor can also be used to capture IPv4 traffic to troubleshoot many issues with IPv4-based TCP/IP communications. However, interpreting the captured IPv4 packets requires a thorough understanding of the protocols involved.

#### Verifying IPv4 Connectivity
You can use the following tasks to troubleshoot problems with IPv4 connectivity:

##### Repair the Connection
The Network Connection Repair feature can quickly renew IPv4 network connection settings to correct common configuration issues. To access Network Connection Repair:
1. Open the Network Connections folder.
2. Right-click the connection you want to repair, and then click "Repair."

Alternatively, you can click "Repair" on the Support tab for the status of a network connection.

Network Connection Repair performs the following tasks:
- Checks if DHCP is enabled and, if so, sends a broadcast DHCPRequest message to refresh the IPv4 address configuration.
- Flushes the ARP cache (`arp -d *`).
- Flushes and reloads the DNS client resolver cache with entries from the Hosts file (`ipconfig /flushdns`).
- Re-registers DNS names using DNS dynamic update (`ipconfig /registerdns`).
- Flushes and reloads the NetBIOS name cache with #PRE entries in the Lmhosts file (`nbtstat -R`).
- Releases and re-registers NetBIOS names with the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) (`nbtstat -RR`).

##### Verify Configuration
To check the current IPv4 settings, use the following commands:
- `ipconfig /all`: Displays IPv4 addresses, default gateways, and DNS settings for all interfaces.
- `netsh interface ip show config`: Displays DNS and WINS servers per interface. Use the `-r RemoteComputerName` option to view the configuration of a remote computer.
- Support tab on the Status dialog box: Double-click the connection in the Network Connections folder, and then click the Support tab to see the address type, IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Click "Details" for more information.

##### Manage Configuration
To make changes to the IPv4 address configuration, you can:
- Use the Network Connections folder to modify the properties of the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component for the appropriate network connection.
- Use `netsh interface ip set` commands to configure the address type, IPv4 address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server addresses, and WINS server addresses.
- Use the `-r RemoteComputerName` option with the `Netsh` tool to manage the IPv4 configuration of a remote computer.
- Use `Ipconfig` commands to manage DHCP addresses, such as `ipconfig /release`, `ipconfig /renew`, `ipconfig /showclassid`, and `ipconfig /setclassid`.

##### Verify Reachability
To verify reachability with a local or remote destination, try the following:
- **Check and flush the ARP cache**: Use `arp -a` to display the current contents of the ARP cache. Use `arp -d *` to flush the ARP cache.
- **Ping the default gateway**: Use the `Ping` tool to ping your default gateway by its IPv4 address. This tests whether you can reach local nodes and the default gateway.
- **Ping a remote destination by its IPv4 address**: If you can ping the default gateway, try pinging a remote destination by its IPv4 address.
- **Trace the route to the remote destination**: If you cannot ping a remote destination, use `tracert -d IPv4Address` to trace the routing path. The `-d` option prevents DNS reverse queries, speeding up the display.

##### Check Packet Filtering
If you cannot reach a destination node, the issue might be due to IPsec or packet filtering configurations. Check for the following:
- On the source node: Active connection security rules with the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in, active IPsec policies with the IP Security Monitor snap-in, and IPv4 packet filters on routing interfaces with the Routing and Remote Access snap-in.
- On intermediate IPv4 routers: Active connection security rules with the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in and active IPsec policies with the IP Security Monitor snap-in.
