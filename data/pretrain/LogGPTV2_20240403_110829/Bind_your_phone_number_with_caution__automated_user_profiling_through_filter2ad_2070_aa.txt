## Abstract
Messenger applications have become increasingly popular due to their cost-effective communication and user-friendly experience. One of the features that has been integrated into many of these applications is Address Book Matching, which helps users connect with real-world contacts. However, this feature also introduces significant privacy risks. In this paper, we present a novel method to exploit Address Book Matching to automatically collect user profiles. This method can be applied to any application with Address Book Matching, regardless of the mobile platform. We also develop an Android prototype to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we integrate profiles from different messenger applications and perform a consistency and authenticity analysis on the collected data. Our experiments demonstrate that the misuse of Address Book Matching can lead to severe user privacy breaches. Finally, we propose countermeasures for developers to mitigate these issues when designing messenger applications.

## 1. Introduction
Messenger applications, such as WeChat and Kik Messenger, have become essential tools in mobile communication, providing instant messaging services. These applications have gained widespread popularity, with WeChat, for example, doubling its user base from 100 million in March 2012 to 200 million in September 2012. Users often register with genuine personal information to be easily discovered by friends, but this can lead to privacy risks. Additionally, many messenger applications include Address Book Matching, which allows users to upload their contact lists to the server to find other users who are also registered. This feature, while convenient, can expose users' personal information to potential attackers.

Our research is motivated by the increasing adoption of Address Book Matching in popular messenger applications. We show that the misuse of this feature can result in large-scale privacy breaches. Specifically, we make the following contributions:
1. We introduce a novel method to automatically collect user profiles through messenger applications on mobile platforms.
2. We implement a prototype to validate our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness through single-application and cross-application analyses.
3. We provide recommendations for mobile application developers to prevent privacy leaks caused by the misuse of Address Book Matching.

## 2. Problem Formulation
### 2.1 Abusing Address Book Matching
Address Book Matching is designed to establish connections between a user's application account and their phone number, which serves as a unique identifier. Users can upload their address books to the application server, which returns a list of accounts bound to the phone numbers in the address book. While this feature is intended to help users find their real-world contacts, it can be exploited by attackers to gather sensitive information.

We propose a method to exploit Address Book Matching to reveal user profiles. Our approach involves uploading a forged address book containing a large number of recommended individuals and randomly chosen phone numbers. The application server then returns a list of accounts and corresponding profiles. Even if some applications store phone numbers as hash values, this does not significantly impact our method, as the matching process is performed in plain text.

### 2.2 Information Integration and Analysis
The content and structure of user profiles vary across applications. By integrating data from multiple applications, we can create more comprehensive user profiles.

#### 2.2.1 Horizontal Collaboration
Horizontal collaboration involves two parts: broad union and deep intersection. Broad union combines distinct accounts from different phone numbers, while deep intersection aims to gather detailed information about a single real identity. Since phone numbers are globally unique, they can be linked to multiple accounts across different applications.

#### 2.2.2 Vertical Penetration
Vertical penetration involves using the same login ID across multiple applications, such as those provided by Facebook and Tencent. This can provide more detailed personal information but requires more manual effort.

#### 2.2.3 Consistency and Authenticity Analysis
We analyze the consistency and authenticity of user profiles collected from different applications. For consistency, we trust field values that are consistent across all applications. For inconsistent values, we use a winner-take-all scheme. For authenticity, particularly for names, we use a database of common Chinese surnames and regular patterns to identify possible official names.

### 2.3 Malicious Usage
Attackers can use the collected user profiles for various malicious activities, such as:
- Establishing links between real identities and virtual accounts.
- Determining whether specific phone numbers are in use.
- Performing targeted advertising based on collected information.
- Cloning identities to carry out fraud.

## 3. System Overview
### 3.1 Method
Our method consists of three phases: address generation, information collection, and data analysis.

#### Address Generation
This phase generates lists of target phone numbers. Attackers typically enumerate all interested phone numbers, which are formatted as standard contacts for querying the application server.

#### Information Collection
We feed the generated contact lists to the target application via Address Book Matching. The application returns a list of users within the contact list, each with an account and bound phone number. The Information Collector handles the returned user data.

#### Data Analysis
This phase involves a deeper understanding of the collected data, including single-application analysis and cross-application integration.

### 3.2 Implementation
We built our prototype on the Android platform. Access to application data is often protected, so we monitor Android APIs to collect user profile data. We use ADB shell commands to automate the process and ensure scalability.

## 4. Experiment and Data Analysis
### 4.1 Ethical Considerations
Our experiments involve randomly forging an address book and collecting corresponding user profiles. While this may raise ethical and legal concerns, it is the most efficient and effective way to conduct our research. We take steps to ensure that the collected data remains secure and is not used for further penetration attempts.

### 4.2 Single Application Analysis
We conducted experiments using WeChat (Version 4.2 for Android). We forged a list of 100,000 contacts and uploaded it to the WeChat server. The server returned a list of 14,179 registered users, allowing us to collect their profiles, including WeChat ID, display name, phone number, gender, region, and "what’s up" status. The display name is often close to the user's real name, making it valuable for identification.

### 4.3 Cross-Application Integration
By integrating profiles from different applications, we can create more comprehensive user profiles. This allows us to perform a consistency and authenticity analysis, providing deeper insights into the collected data.

## 5. Conclusion
Our research demonstrates the potential privacy risks associated with the misuse of Address Book Matching in messenger applications. We propose a method to exploit this feature and provide recommendations for developers to mitigate these risks. Future work will focus on further refining our approach and exploring additional countermeasures.
