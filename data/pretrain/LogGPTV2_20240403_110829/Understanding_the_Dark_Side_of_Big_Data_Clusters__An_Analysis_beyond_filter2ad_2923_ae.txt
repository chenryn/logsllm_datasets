### Resource Utilization and Event Rates

#### Eviction, Fail, Kill, and Finish Events

- **Eviction**: The decision to evict tasks is primarily based on the allocated CPU, as indicated by stable eviction rates across different levels of RAM reservation.
- **Fail, Kill, Finish**:
  - **Time Ranges**:
    - (0, 0.5)
    - [0.5, 0.9)
    - [0.9, 1.1)
    - [1.1, 1.5)
    - >=1.5
  - **Machine Locality (c)**: The impact of machine locality on event rates is illustrated in Figure 9.

#### Impact of Resource Reservation

The smaller difference between the maximum and minimum values across reservation levels suggests that CPU reservation has a higher impact than RAM reservation on the event type. For example, stable eviction rates across different levels of RAM reservation indicate that the decision to evict tasks is mainly based on the allocated CPU.

#### Resource Utilization

- **Definition**: Resource utilization is defined as the total amount of resources used by co-executed tasks at the time of an event, divided by the resources equipped on the machine.
- **CPU and RAM Utilization**:
  - Median values: CPU = 0.37, RAM = 0.45.
  - Most events fall within the first four ranges of resource utilization (Figures 8(e) and 8(f)).
  - **Trends**:
    - All types show similar trends relative to CPU and memory utilization, especially for utilization greater than 0.8.
    - **Kill Rate**: Increases monotonically with both CPU and RAM utilization. When CPU utilization is greater than 1, tasks are killed with high probability due to resource shortages.
    - **Eviction Rate**: Stable below 0.1 for both CPU and RAM.
    - **Finish Events**: Highest rates occur when CPU is moderately utilized (between 0.4 and 0.8).

#### Machine Capacity

- **Analysis**: Event rates show constant trends across different ranges of machine capacity.
- **Conclusion**: Machine capacity has no significant impact on event rates.

### Key Messages

- **Eviction**: More affected by resource reservation, particularly CPU.
- **Kill**: More affected by resource utilization.
- **Finish**: Tasks are executed successfully with fairly constant probability across all resource reservation levels. The probability of successful finish is high when requested resources and CPU utilization are moderate (around 0.04 and 0.6, respectively).
- **Resource Management**: To minimize unsuccessful executions, resource management policies should ensure optimal CPU utilization and concurrency.

### Jobs

#### Job Event Rate, Execution Time, and Machine Locality

- **Job Types**: Dominated by "finish" (57.7%) and "kill" (40.7%). Almost all unsuccessful jobs are killed.
- **Focus**: Analysis focuses on "kill" and "finish" jobs.

#### 1. Job Size

- **Definition**: Job size is defined as the number of tasks.
- **Observations**:
  - **Kill Rate**: Increases exponentially with job size.
  - **Finish Rate**: Decreases exponentially with job size.
  - **Implication**: Job size is a strong indicator of job success rate. Users tend to kill larger jobs, which have higher probabilities of suffering from bad system conditions.
  - **Big-Data Applications**: Large jobs composed of many small tasks can mitigate long-tailed response times, but this trend overlooks dependability issues related to large job sizes.

#### 2. Job Execution Time

- **Observations**:
  - **Kill Rate**: High (close to 0.5) for jobs executing for more than 2 minutes. For jobs longer than one day, the kill rate exceeds 0.9.
  - **Finish Rate**: Shows a decreasing trend in a step-like function with turning points at 2 minutes and one day.
  - **Fail Rate**: Slightly increases for jobs longer than one day.
  - **Implication**: Jobs older than one day are nearly impossible to complete. Systems could adopt signaling messages to alert users about the probability of job failure based on execution time, allowing proactive actions.

#### 3. Machine Locality

- **Definition**: When the value is 1, all events experienced by a job happen on the same set of machines.
- **Observations**:
  - **Distribution**: 2% of jobs have a value lower than 0.9, 5% have a value greater than 1.1, and 93% have a value between 0.9 and 1.1.
  - **Impact**:
    - **Finish Rate**: Highest when machine locality is close to 1.
    - **Kill and Fail Rates**: Higher when machine locality is much higher than 1.
  - **Implication**: Executing events on the same set of machines results in the highest finish job rate. Neutral machine locality (job size equal to the number of unique machines) can result in a high success rate.

### Key Messages

- **Job Size**: High impact on kill jobs, indicating the need to consider kill probability when deciding the number of tasks per job.
- **Execution Time**: A crucial parameter for users' decisions to kill jobs. A feedback mechanism indicating job kill probability over time might be useful to avoid resource waste.
- **Machine Locality**: Keeping a neutral machine locality (job size equal to the number of unique machines) can result in a high success rate.

### Related Studies

- **Workload Analysis**: Key aspect in designing datacenters and improving application/system dependability for big-data clusters.
- **Google Trace Analysis**: Previous studies focused on various aspects such as resource and workload heterogeneity, latency-sensitivity, and task preemption. However, none exhaustively studied unsuccessful executions.
- **Failure Analysis**: Studies on hardware failures and their impact on different computing infrastructures, but rarely captured the impact on application performance.

### Concluding Remarks

- **Performance Impact**: Unsuccessful executions slow down task response time and result in significant waste of machine time and resource demand.
- **Patterns and Root Causes**: Fail and eviction happen repetitively on single tasks; finish jobs have a low number of tasks and events, while kill jobs have a high number of tasks and a high percentage of finish events.
- **Predictive Models**: Future work will focus on employing statistical learning techniques to model and predict the dependability of big-data clusters.
