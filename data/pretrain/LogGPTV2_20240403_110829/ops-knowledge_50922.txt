User: In linux, how can I determine the default text editor, terminal, etc?
does it vary by distro?
Assistant: I accessed the list while ago programatically in a rather ugly manner and I'm sure its not the best way. The options are stored in a file called defaults.list (I think this is generally the case).  The location is less general I think it in /usr/share/applications/ on my ubuntu system although it does appear elsewhere I think. I then treated it as a text file.
