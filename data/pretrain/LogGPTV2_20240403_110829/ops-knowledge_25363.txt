User: I am trying to re-install python3 on my mac using brew by 
brew install python3. 
But when proceeding to the the link step, it threw an error:  
The brew link step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local
Could not symlink bin/2to3-3.5
Target /usr/local/bin/2to3-3.5
already exists. You may want to remove it:
rm '/usr/local/bin/2to3-3.5'
To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite python3
To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite --dry-run python3 
But after using rm '/usr/local/bin/2to3-3.5 and brew link --overwrite python3,
an other error occured:Error: Permission denied - /usr/local/Frameworks. 
And I don't know why this happened, because I cannot see the Frameworks directory under /usr/local/.
Assistant: I [believe I] resolved this by chown'ing and chgrp'ing everything in /usr/local/Cellar and then unlinking and relinking:
------
% brew link python3
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/python/3.6.5...
Error: Could not symlink bin/2to3
Target /usr/local/bin/2to3
is a symlink belonging to python@3.9. You can unlink it:
brew unlink python@3.9
To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
brew link --overwrite python
To list all files that would be deleted:
brew link --overwrite --dry-run python
kevcool@MacBook-Pro-2 Cellar % brew unlink python@3.9
