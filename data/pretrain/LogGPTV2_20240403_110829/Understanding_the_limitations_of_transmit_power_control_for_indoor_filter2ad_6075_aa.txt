ABSTRACT
A wide range of transmit power control (TPC) algorithms
have been proposed in recent literature to reduce interfer-
ence and increase capacity in 802.11 wireless networks. How-
ever, few of them have made it to practice. In many cases
this gap is attributed to lack of suitable hardware support
in wireless cards to implement these algorithms. In particu-
lar, many research eﬀorts have indicated that wireless card
vendors need to support power control mechanisms in a ﬁne-
grained manner – both in the number of possible power levels
and the time granularity at which the controls can be ap-
plied. In this paper we claim that even if ﬁne-grained power
control mechanisms were to be made available by wireless
card vendors, algorithms would not be able to properly lever-
age such degrees of control in typical indoor environments.
We prove this claim through rigorous empirical analysis and
then build a tunable empirical model (Model-TPC) that can
determine the granularity of power control that is actually
useful. To illustrate the importance of our solution, we con-
clude by demonstrating the impact of choice of power control
granularity on Internet applications where wireless clients
interact with servers on the Internet. We observe that the
number of feasible power was found to be between 2-4 for
most indoor environments. We believe that the results from
this study can serve as the right set of assumptions to build
practically realizable TPC algorithms in the future.

INTRODUCTION
√
Power control mechanisms in wireless networks have been
used to meet two diﬀerent objectives — to reduce energy
consumption in mobile devices, so as to conserve battery life,
and to reduce interference in the shared medium, thereby al-
lowing greater re-use and concurrency of communication. In
this paper, our focus is to study power control as applica-
ble to the interference reduction objective. As an example
in this paper, we consider the impact of power control for
WLAN clients interacting with servers on the Internet. Re-
cent theoretical work has shown that ideal medium access
protocol using optimal power control can improve channel
ρ, where ρ is the density
utilization by up to a factor of
of nodes in the region (using ﬂuid model approximations)
[10]. Power control mechanisms [12, 21, 19] typically try to
optimize the ﬂoor space acquired by wireless transmissions
by limiting the transmit power of control and data packets,
thereby providing opportunity for multiple ﬂows to coexist.
A number of research eﬀorts have studied power control
based on the theoretical abstraction of wireless signal prop-
agation in free space and consider transmit power as a con-
tinuous variable (i.e., a ﬁne grained parameter), that can be
set per packet to yield optimal performance. Conventional
power control mechanisms have exercised ﬁne grained con-
trol in the two dimensions as shown in Figure 1 : 1) Time
granularity at which power level is changed, 2) Magnitude
granularity by which the power level is changed. We ana-
lyze both the dimensions of ﬁne grained power control and
provide guidelines for power control granularity in typical
indoor environments.
Prior work [9] has pointed out that lack of vendor support
for ﬁne-grained power control mechanisms in the wireless
cards inhibit deployment of these mechanisms. In this paper
we ask the following questions: Is ﬁne-grained power con-
trol really useful and would lead to a better design of power-
control algorithms? If not, what is the minimum granularity
of power control that is useful in diﬀerent wireless environ-
ments, including Internet oriented wireless communication
? We answer the ﬁrst question in the negative. As we dis-
cuss in detail in the paper, in practical indoor wireless LAN
(WLAN) deployments, multipath and fading eﬀects, cou-
pled with various sources of interference in the unlicensed
bands, imply that power control algorithms cannot derive
signiﬁcant beneﬁts from very ﬁne-grained mechanisms. We

and lie on the magnitude dimension. IPMA, Sub-
barao et. al. rely on changing the transmit power
on a per packet basis and hence lie on the time di-
mension
demonstrate this through detailed experimentation in diﬀer-
ent indoor wireless network environments. We estimate the
1
distributions of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
for various transmit power levels at the transmitter and
show that although more power at the transmitter on av-
erage translates to more power at the receiver, there is sig-
niﬁcant overlap between the RSSI distributions for nearby
power levels, making them practically indistinguishable at
the receiver. This can be attributed to dominant multipath
and fading eﬀects, that lead to signiﬁcant signal strength
variations in indoor environments.
Our answer to the second question is that a power control
algorithm can make practical use of only a few (2-3) discrete
number of power levels. The exact number and choice of
power levels is a characteristic of the multipath and fading of
a particular wireless environment and the presence of other
interfering sources.
Our observations are true for both ad-hoc networks and
Internet oriented wireless communications (WLANs), and in
this paper we present our results from the latter setting. In
particular, through this work we build an empirical model
that allows us to characterize the speciﬁc set of power levels
that is useful for a given environment and could be used to
perform per packet power control.
Power control is also an important design consideration
in cellular networks, where is it primarily used to counter
fast fading. However, cellular networks primarily operate in
outdoor environment, where we show that the eﬀect of mul-
tipath is not signiﬁcant enough to hinder ﬁne grained TPC.

Variations in RSSI typically correspond to variations in Sig-
nal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as shown by Reis et. al in their
measurement based study of delivery and interference mod-
els for static wireless networks
[8]. Moreover commodity
wireless cards only report the RSSI values for each packet
and hence we base our observations on the measurement for
RSSI values. We further discuss this in detail in Section 3.
We discuss more about relevance of our work in context of
cellular networks in Section 6.
Key contributions
The following are the key contributions and the main obser-
vations from this work:
• Measurement: We collect extensive traces from mul-
tiple environments such as oﬃce building and univer-
sity departments, to characterize Received Signal Strength
Indicator (RSSI) variations in diﬀerent indoor settings.
Through rigorous statistical analysis of the traces us-
ing Allan’s Deviation (for characterizing the burst size
of RSSI ﬂuctuations) and Normalized Kullback-Leibler
Divergence (NKLD)
(for characterizing RSSI distri-
bution in real time), we observe that the number of
feasible power levels that can be used in a transmit
power control mechanism is few and discrete, and once
identiﬁed, could be used to perform power control at
small time scales (per packet).
• Model: Through this analysis, we propose an empir-
ical model to determine the set of useful power levels
in an online fashion, i.e., this model is computed and
adjusted dynamically as wireless data communication
is going on. Note, that the number and choice of such
power levels would depend on individual wireless en-
vironment.
In all our experimental scenarios, it was
found to be less than 4 and often much less.
• Validation: Through Internet-oriented wireless ex-
periments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the our
measurement based empirical model (Model-TPC) for
improving performance of wireless clients interacting
with servers on the Internet in our indoor WLAN de-
ployment. In particular, we show that correct choice
of power levels can lead to actual throughput gains in
indoor environments.
We believe that our our experiments highlight some fun-
damental issues with transmit power control, that can help
in design of future wireless interfaces that are used in lap-
tops, PDAs and are widely used as a major Internet access
mechanism.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 motivates the infeasibility of ﬁne grained power con-
trol in indoor WLANs and discusses various transmit power
mechanism proposed in literature, with their respective eval-
uation in context of our practical models for transmit power
control.
In Section 3, we analyze the RSSI distributions
under varying indoor scenarios and propose an online mech-
anism (Online-RSSI) to characterize the distribution in real
time. We use the online mechanism to derive an empirical
model for transmit power control (Model-TPC) described
in Section 4. Section 5 highlights the impact of using our
empirical model on end user experience through Internet ori-
ented wireless experiments. We brieﬂy discuss power control
in cellular networks in section 6 and some related work in 7.
Finally we conclude in section 8.

wireless cards which have only limited number of discrete
power levels. As described in [9] , most of the wireless cards
support only 4 to 5 power levels at the hardware, which
is in stark contrast to the ﬁne grained control preferred by
most power control schemes like PCMA [12], SHUSH[19]
and IPMA [21]. This being a limitation of current state
of the art hardware, can be resolved in future wireless cards
that may support ﬁne grained power levels. However, we ar-
gue that there are fundamental constraints to power control
in indoor wireless environments, which limits the number of
feasible power levels that is useful in such mechanisms. We
substantiate our claim through indoor WLAN and outdoor
experiments in the following section, where we show that
RSSI variations are present in both outdoor and indoor en-
vironments, but are especially dominant in indoor scenarios.
2.1 Infeasibility of Fine Grained Power
Control
We present preliminary results from our detailed set of
experiments explained in Section 3 to illustrate the funda-
mental constraints of ﬁne-grained power control.
Outdoor Scenario
This sample experiment consists of a pair of outdoor transmitter-
receiver pair (T4-R4) shown in Figure 2 operating using the
802.11a standard. At R4 we capture the packets transmit-
ted by T4 for diﬀerent power levels available at T4’s Atheros
based wireless chipset. Since low RSSI is more likely to cause
a packet error, we have enabled Madwiﬁ driver to receive
packets in error and in order to prevent the bias towards
high RSSI values, we include the RSSI of erroneous packets
in our calculations for RSSI distributions. Figure 3 shows
the probability density function of RSSI distribution for var-
ious power levels at the transmitter. The power levels are
increased from 10mW to 60mW (max. transmit power), in
steps of 10mW. For the sake of clarity, these power levels
are chosen so that there is minimal overlap between their
respective RSSI distributions. For example at a power level
Figure 3: Probability Distribution of RSSI for vary-
ing power levels at the transmitter is shown in the
ﬁgure. The top ﬁgure corresponds to outdoor sce-
nario with 6 distinguishable power levels while bot-
tom ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of increased multipath
and interference in the indoor WLAN scenario with
the number of distinct power levels reduced from 6
to 3. Band:802.11g Data Packet Size:1Kbytes
of 60 mW, the RSSI values vary from 35dBm to 45dBm,
with 40 percent of the packets being received at 41dBm.
The average variation in RSSI value over all power levels is
approximately 7.5 dBm.
This variation can be attributed to the multipath and fad-
ing eﬀects, due to which the packets transmitted at the same
power level, may be received with varied signal strength at
the receiver. A diﬀerence of an order of wavelength in the
paths taken by the wireless signals from the transmitter, can
lead to the two signals being out of phase [17], resulting in
variations in the signal strength at the receiver. Even though
more power at the sender translates to more power at the
receiver, the distributions of the received signal power over-
laps signiﬁcantly, thereby making them hardly distinguish-
able. As we show next, this eﬀect is even more pronounced
in indoor environments than in outdoor environments where
there are only a few strong paths that impact the signal.
Indoor Scenario
We repeat the aforementioned experiments for an indoor
transmitter-receiver pair T2-R2 as shown in Figure 2. The
resulting distribution of RSSI values is shown in Figure 3.
As expected the RSSI variations increase, thereby increasing
the overlap between RSSI of neighboring power levels. This
observation indicates that in indoor settings, the number of
power levels having non-overlapping RSSI distributions are
further reduced, thereby making ﬁne-grained transmit power
control much less eﬀective. These experiments show that
ﬁne grained transmit power control mechanism are much
more diﬃcult to realize in indoor deployments.
It is evident from Figure 3 that in a collective fashion, the
distribution of all the six power levels cover a wide range
of RSSI values (20 - 45 dBm). Also note that for any sin-
gle power level, its RSSI distribution overlaps signiﬁcantly
with that of neighboring power levels. The introduction of
ﬁne grained power levels at the hardware will imply signiﬁ-
cant overlap between the distribution of existing power levels
(0,10,14,15,17,18)dBm and the new power levels. A signiﬁ-
cant overlap between the RSSI distributions of two (succes-
sive) power levels correspondingly diminishes the practical
eﬀect of having the respective distinct power levels – they be-
come practically indistinguishable at the receiver. This can
be considered analogous to the concept of channels in 802.11
band, where there are 11 channels available but only 3 chan-
nels are non overlapping and hence useful. Similarly, ﬁne
grained power levels cannot be distinguished easily at the
receiver due to RSSI variations and hence may not be useful
simultaneously.
We performed the same set of experiments at two diﬀerent
location, at the NEC Research Labs at Princeton and at the
Computer Sciences Department at University of Wisconsin-
Madison. We observed that, although the exact shape of the
RSSI distribution may depend on the exact indoor environ-
ment and other interference eﬀects, the general nature re-
mains similar to Figure 3. In this paper, we report our mea-
surements from the NEC Research Labs, which we believe
are representative of a typical indoor WLAN scenario.
Next we summarize prior approaches proposed in the lit-
erature that rely on ﬁne grained power control. We show
why such approaches might face diﬃculty in a practical im-
plementation. We also discuss how our proposed empirical
model could act as an oracle to guide such algorithms to
change transmit power that are eﬀective in practice.
2.2 Implications on Existing Power Control
Approaches
We categorize some of the prior power control methods
applicable to WLANs into two categories : 1) ﬁne-grained
in magnitude of transmit power and 2) ﬁne-grained in mag-
nitude of time (per-packet). Existing power control ap-
proaches can be categorized in the two aforementioned cat-
egories as shown in Figure 1. We explain the implications
of our observations on both categories of protocols:
Magnitude Dimension of Fine Grained Power Control
Monks et al. proposed a power controlled multiple access
wireless MAC protocol (PCMA [12]), within the collision
avoidance framework. PCMA generalizes the transmit-or-
defer ”on/oﬀ” collision avoidance models to a more ﬂexible
”variable bounded power” collision suppression model. Using
PCMA, the transmitter-receiver pairs can be more tightly
packed into the network by adjusting the power level of the
transmitter to the minimum required for a successful trans-
mission, thereby allowing a greater number of simultaneous
transmissions (spectral reuse). In order to ensure successful
packet delivery, each receiver in PCMA ﬁrst calculates the
extra noise that it can tolerate, such that the SNR for its
own packets is above the threshold for correct reception. It
then advertises this noise tolerance by sending a busy tone
on the auxiliary channel, and all the transmitters in the
vicinity measure the received signal strength of the tone to
determine the maximum power with which they can initi-
ate their own transmissions. This mechanism requires exact
calculations of received power, which mat not be predictable
under multipath and fading eﬀects. Moreover, the authors
treat transmit power as a continuous parameter, which may
not be feasible in indoor environments due to signiﬁcant
RSSI variations.
Seth et al. propose a reactive transmit power control
mechanism, called SHUSH [19], where nodes operate on the
optimum(minimum) power required for communication. On
detecting interference, SHUSH calculates the exact power re-
