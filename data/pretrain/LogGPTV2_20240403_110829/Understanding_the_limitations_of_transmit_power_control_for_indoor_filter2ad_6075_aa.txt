**Abstract:**
A variety of transmit power control (TPC) algorithms have been proposed to reduce interference and increase capacity in 802.11 wireless networks. However, few of these algorithms have been implemented in practice, often due to a lack of suitable hardware support in wireless cards. Many studies suggest that fine-grained power control, both in terms of the number of power levels and the time granularity at which controls can be applied, is necessary. In this paper, we argue that even if such fine-grained power control mechanisms were available, they would not be fully effective in typical indoor environments. We support this claim through rigorous empirical analysis and develop a tunable empirical model (Model-TPC) to determine the useful granularity of power control. Our results show that only 2-4 discrete power levels are feasible in most indoor environments. This study provides insights for designing practical TPC algorithms in the future.

## 1. Introduction

Power control mechanisms in wireless networks aim to reduce energy consumption and minimize interference, thereby improving channel utilization. In this paper, we focus on power control for reducing interference, particularly in the context of WLAN clients interacting with Internet servers. Recent theoretical work suggests that optimal power control can significantly enhance channel utilization. However, many proposed TPC algorithms assume continuous and fine-grained power control, which may not be practical in real-world indoor environments due to multipath and fading effects.

Prior research has highlighted the lack of vendor support for fine-grained power control as a major barrier to implementation. We address two key questions: 
1. Is fine-grained power control truly beneficial?
2. If not, what is the minimum granularity of power control that is useful in different wireless environments?

Our findings indicate that very fine-grained power control is not practical in indoor settings. Through extensive experimentation, we show that the overlap in RSSI distributions for nearby power levels makes them indistinguishable at the receiver. We propose an empirical model (Model-TPC) that can dynamically determine the set of useful power levels. Our experiments demonstrate that 2-3 discrete power levels are sufficient in most indoor environments.

## 2. Motivation: Power Control Approaches and Limitations

### 2.1 Infeasibility of Fine-Grained Power Control

Current 802.11 wireless cards typically support only 4-5 discrete power levels, which is insufficient for the fine-grained control required by many TPC schemes. Even if future hardware supports more levels, fundamental constraints in indoor environments, such as multipath and fading, limit the effectiveness of fine-grained power control.

#### Outdoor Scenario
We conducted an experiment with an outdoor transmitter-receiver pair (T4-R4) using the 802.11a standard. The RSSI values for different power levels (10mW to 60mW) showed significant overlap, making it difficult to distinguish between adjacent power levels. The average variation in RSSI was approximately 7.5 dBm, primarily due to multipath and fading effects.

#### Indoor Scenario
In an indoor setting with a transmitter-receiver pair (T2-R2), the RSSI variations were even more pronounced, further reducing the number of distinguishable power levels. The overlap in RSSI distributions for neighboring power levels indicates that fine-grained power control is less effective in indoor environments.

### 2.2 Implications on Existing Power Control Approaches

Many existing TPC methods, such as PCMA [12] and SHUSH [19], rely on fine-grained power control. These approaches assume that transmit power can be continuously adjusted, which is not feasible in indoor settings due to significant RSSI variations. Our empirical model (Model-TPC) can guide these algorithms to use power levels that are practically distinguishable and effective.

## 3. Empirical Analysis and Model Development

### 3.1 RSSI Distribution Analysis

We collected extensive traces from various indoor environments, including office buildings and university departments, to characterize RSSI variations. Using statistical tools like Allan’s Deviation and Normalized Kullback-Leibler Divergence, we observed that only a few discrete power levels are feasible. Our analysis shows that 2-4 power levels are sufficient in most indoor settings.

### 3.2 Online Mechanism for RSSI Characterization

We developed an online mechanism (Online-RSSI) to dynamically characterize RSSI distributions in real-time. This mechanism allows us to adjust the power levels based on the current wireless environment, ensuring that the chosen power levels are effective.

## 4. Validation and Experimental Results

### 4.1 Internet-Oriented Wireless Experiments

We validated our Model-TPC through Internet-oriented wireless experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the performance of wireless clients interacting with Internet servers. Correctly choosing the power levels led to significant throughput gains in indoor environments.

## 5. Discussion and Future Work

### 5.1 Power Control in Cellular Networks

While power control is crucial in cellular networks, primarily for countering fast fading, the outdoor environment generally experiences less multipath and fading, making fine-grained TPC more feasible. Our work highlights the need for different approaches in indoor WLANs.

### 5.2 Related Work

We discuss related work in the field of TPC and highlight how our findings complement and extend existing research.

## 6. Conclusion

Our study demonstrates that fine-grained power control is not practical in typical indoor WLAN environments. We propose a tunable empirical model (Model-TPC) that can determine the useful power levels in real-time. Our results provide valuable insights for designing practical TPC algorithms for future wireless interfaces.
