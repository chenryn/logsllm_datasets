User: I want to enable full access to the terminal (to install Python), so I need to enable developer mode. But I don't want to lose automatic updates to ChromeOS.
Does enabling developer mode in ChromeOS disable automatic updates?
Assistant: I receive automatic canary updates every day in dev mode. That info must be outdated.
