    In this chapter, I’ll introduce the most useful recon techniques for a bug bounty hunter. Then I’ll walk you through the basics of writing bash scripts to automate recon tasks and make them more efficient.
     Bash
    is a shell interpreter available on macOS and Linux systems. Though this chapter assumes you’re using a Linux system, you should be able to install many of these tools on other operating systems as well. You need to install some of the tools we discuss in this chapter before using them. I have included links to all the tools at the end of the chapter.
    在这一章节，我将介绍适用于漏洞赏金猎人最有用的侦查技巧。然后，我将向您介绍编写Bash脚本以自动化侦查任务并使其更加高效的基础知识。Bash是可在macOS和Linux系统上使用的shell解释器。尽管本章假设您使用的是Linux系统，但您也应该能够在其他操作系统上安装许多这些工具。在使用这些工具之前，您需要安装本章中讨论的一些工具。我已在本章末尾附上了所有工具的链接。
    Before you go on, please verify that you’re allowed to perform intrusive recon on your target before you attempt any techniques that actively engage with it. In particular, activities like port scanning, spidering, and directory brute-forcing can generate a lot of unwanted traffic on a site and may not be welcomed by the organization.
    在继续之前，请先确认你有权进行有侵入性的侦察行为，再尝试那些会主动对目标发起攻击的技术。特别是像端口扫描、蜘蛛爬行和目录爆破等活动，可能会在网站上产生大量不必要的流量，并可能不被该组织所欢迎。
    Manually Walking Through the Target
    Before we dive into anything else, it will help to first manually walk through the application to learn more about it. Try to uncover every feature in the application that users can access by browsing through every page and clicking every link. Access the functionalities that you don’t usually use.
    在我们深入讨论其他内容之前，首先手动浏览一遍应用程序会有所帮助，以更好地了解它。尝试浏览每一页并点击每个链接，揭示用户可以访问的应用程序中的每个功能。使用通常不用的功能。
    For example, if you’re hacking Facebook, try to create an event, play a game, and use the payment functionality if you’ve never done so before. Sign up for an account at every privilege level to reveal all of the application’s features. For example, on Slack, you can create owners, admins, and members of a workspace. Also create users who are members of different channels under the same workspace. This way, you can see what the application looks like to different users.
    例如，如果你想要黑客Facebook，尝试创建一个事件，玩一个游戏，并使用付款功能（如果你以前从未使用过）。在每个特权级别上注册一个帐户，以揭示应用程序的所有功能。例如，在Slack上，你可以创建工作区的所有者、管理员和成员。还可以创建不同频道下的成员用户。这样，你就可以看到应用程序对不同用户的外观。
    This should give you a rough idea of what the
     attack surface
    (all of the different points at which an attacker can attempt to exploit the application) looks like, where the data entry points are, and how different users interact with each other. Then you can start a more in-depth recon process: finding out the technology and structure of an application.
    这应该给你一个大致的概念，攻击面（攻击者可以尝试利用应用程序的所有不同点）是什么样子的，数据输入点在哪里，不同用户如何相互交互。然后你就可以开始更深入的侦查过程：了解应用程序的技术和结构。
    Google Dorking
    When hunting for bugs, you’ll often need to research the details of a vulnerability. If you’re exploiting a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, you might want to find a particular payload you saw on GitHub. Advanced search-engine skills will help you find the resources you need quickly and accurately.
    寻找漏洞时，你经常需要研究漏洞的具体细节。如果你正在利用一个可能存在的跨站脚本漏洞，你可能希望在GitHub上找到一个特定的有效载荷。高级搜索引擎技巧将帮助你快速准确地找到所需的资源。
    In fact, advanced Google searches are a powerful technique that hackers often use to perform recon. Hackers call this
     Google dorking
    . For the average Joe, Google is just a text search tool for finding images, videos, and web pages. But for the hacker, Google can be a means of discovering valuable information such as hidden admin portals, unlocked password files, and leaked authentication keys.
    实际上，高级的谷歌搜索是黑客经常用来进行侦查的强大技术。黑客称之为谷歌搜索。对于普通人来说，谷歌只是一个文本搜索工具，用于查找图像、视频和网页。但对于黑客来说，谷歌可以成为一种发现有价值信息的手段，比如隐藏的管理员门户、解锁的密码文件和泄露的认证密钥。
    Google’s search engine has its own built-in query language that helps you filter your searches. Here are some of the most useful operators that can be used with any Google search:
    谷歌搜索引擎拥有自己的内置查询语言，可帮助您过滤搜索结果。以下是一些可与任何谷歌搜索一起使用的最有用的运算符：
     site
    网站
     Tells Google to show you results from a certain site only. This will help you quickly find the most reputable source on the topic that you are researching. For example, if you wanted to search for the syntax of Python’s
      print()
     function, you could limit your results to the official Python documentation with this search:
      print site:python.org
     .
     inurl
    inurl: 在网址中包含指定关键词
     Searches for pages with a URL that match the search string. It’s a powerful way to search for vulnerable pages on a particular website. Let’s say you’ve read a blog post about how the existence of a page called
      /course/jumpto.php
     on a website could indicate that it’s vulnerable to remote code execution. You can check if the vulnerability exists on your target by searching
      inurl:"/course/jumpto.php" site:example.com
     .
     intitle
    标题
     Finds specific strings in a page’s title. This is useful because it allows you to find pages that contain a particular type of content. For example, file-listing pages on web servers often have
      index of
     in their titles. You can use this query to search for directory pages on a website:
      intitle:"index of" site:example.com
      .
     link
    链接
     Searches for web pages that contain links to a specified URL. You can use this to find documentation about obscure technologies or vulnerabilities. For example, let’s say you’re researching the uncommon regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerability. You’ll easily pull up its definition online but might have a hard time finding examples. The
      link
     operator can discover pages that reference the vulnerability’s Wikipedia page to locate discussions of the same topic:
      link:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS"
     .
     filetype
    文件类型
     Searches for pages with a specific file extension. This is an incredible tool for hacking; hackers often use it to locate files on their target sites that might be sensitive, such as log and password files. For example, this query searches for log files, which often have the
      .log
     file extension, on the target site:
      filetype:log site:example.com
     .
     Wildcard (
      *
     )
    通配符 (*)
     You can use the wildcard operator (
      *
     ) within searches to mean
      any character or series of characters
     . For example, the following query will return any string that starts with
      how to hack
     and ends with
      using Google
     . It will
     match with strings like
      how to hack websites using Google
     ,
      how to hack applications using Google
     , and so on:
      "how to hack * using Google"
     .
     Quotes (
      "
      "
     )
    “Quotes” → “引号”
     Adding quotation marks around your search terms forces an exact match. For example, this query will search for pages that contain the phrase
      how to hack
     :
      "how to hack"
     . And this query will search for pages with the terms
      how
     ,
      to
     , and
      hack
     , although not necessarily together:
      how to hack
     .
     Or (
      |
     )
    或 (|)
     The or operator is denoted with the pipe character (
      |
     ) and can be used to search for one search term or the other, or both at the same time. The pipe character must be surrounded by spaces. For example, this query will search for
      how to hack
     on either Reddit or Stack Overflow:
      "how to hack" site:(reddit.com | stackoverflow.com)
     . And this query will search for web pages that mention either
      SQL Injection
     or
      SQLi
     :
      (SQL Injection | SQLi)
     .
      SQLi
     is an acronym often used to refer to SQL injection attacks, which we’ll talk about in
      Chapter 11
     .
     Minus (
      -
     )
    减号 (-)
     The minus operator (
      -
     ) excludes certain search results. For example, let’s say you’re interested in learning about websites that discuss hacking, but not those that discuss hacking PHP. This query will search for pages that contain
      how to hack websites
     but not
      php
     :
      "how to hack websites" -php
     .
    You can use advanced search engine options in many more ways to make your work more efficient. You can even search for the term
     Google search operators
    to discover more. These operators can be more useful than you’d expect. For example, look for all of a company’s subdomains by searching as follows:
    您可以利用搜索引擎的高级选项来更加高效地完成工作。您甚至可以搜索“Google搜索运算符”等术语，从而发现更多有用的选项。这些运算符可能比您预期的更加有用。例如，您可以通过以下方式搜索所有公司子域名：
site:*.example.com
    You can also look for special endpoints that can lead to vulnerabilities.
     Kibana
    is a data visualization tool that displays server operation data such as server logs, debug messages, and server status. A compromised Kibana instance can allow attackers to collect extensive information about a site’s operation. Many Kibana dashboards run under the path
     app/kibana
    , so this query will reveal whether the target has a Kibana dashboard. You can then try to access the dashboard to see if it’s unprotected:
    您还可以寻找可以导致漏洞的特殊终端点。Kibana是一款数据可视化工具，可以显示服务器操作数据，例如服务器日志、调试信息和服务器状态。被攻击的Kibana实例可以允许攻击者收集关于网站运营的广泛信息。许多Kibana仪表板运行在路径app / kibana下，因此此查询将揭示目标是否具有Kibana仪表板。然后，您可以尝试访问仪表板，以查看它是否未受保护：
site:example.com inurl:app/kibana
    Google can find company resources hosted by a third party online, such as Amazon S3 buckets (we’ll talk about these in more detail in
     “Third-Party Hosting” on page 74
    ):
    谷歌可以找到由第三方在网上托管的公司资源，例如 Amazon S3 存储桶（我们将在第 74 页的“第三方托管”中更详细地介绍这些）。
site:s3.amazonaws.com COMPANY_NAME
    Look for special extensions that could indicate a sensitive file. In addition to
     .log
    , which often indicates log files, search for
     .php
    ,
     cfm
    ,
     asp
    ,
     .jsp
    , and
     .pl
    , the extensions often used for script files:
    寻找能指示敏感文件的特殊扩展名。除了常见的.log表示日志文件外，还要搜索.php、cfm、asp、.jsp和.pl等扩展名，它们通常用于脚本文件。
site:example.com ext:php
site:example.com ext:log
    Finally, you can also combine search terms for a more accurate search. For example, this query searches the site
     example.com
    for text files that contain
     password
    :
    最后，您也可以将搜索词组合起来以获得更准确的搜索结果。例如，以下查询在 example.com 网站中搜索包含密码的文本文件：
site:example.com ext:txt password
    In addition to constructing your own queries, check out the Google Hacking Database (
     https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/
    ), a website that hackers and security practitioners use to share Google search queries for finding security-related information. It contains many search queries that could be helpful to you during the recon process. For example, you can find queries that look for files containing passwords, common URLs of admin portals, or pages built using vulnerable software.
    除了构建自己的查询之外，你还可以查看Google黑客数据库（https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database/），这是黑客和安全从业人员用来共享查找安全相关信息的Google搜索查询的网站。它包含许多在侦察过程中对你有用的搜索查询。例如，你可以找到查找包含密码的文件、管理员门户的常见URL或使用易受攻击软件构建的页面的查询。
    While you are performing recon using Google search, keep in mind that if you’re sending a lot of search queries, Google will start requiring CAPTCHA challenges for visitors from your network before they can perform more searches. This could be annoying to others on your network, so I don’t recommend Google dorking on a corporate or shared network.
    当你使用Google搜索进行侦察时，请记住，如果你发送了大量的搜索查询，Google将开始要求来自你的网络的访问者进行CAPTCHA挑战，然后才能执行更多的搜索。这可能会对你的网络上的其他人造成麻烦，所以我不建议在公司或共享网络上进行Google dorking。
    Scope Discovery
    Let’s now dive into recon itself. First, always verify the target’s scope. A program’s
     scope
    on its policy page specifies which subdomains, products, and applications you’re allowed to attack. Carefully verify which of the company’s assets are in scope to avoid overstepping boundaries during the recon and hacking process. For example, if
     example.com
    ’s policy specifies that
     dev.example.com
    and
     test.example.com
    are out of scope, you shouldn’t perform any recon or attacks on those subdomains.
    让我们现在深入了解侦察本身。首先，始终验证目标的范围。一个程序在其策略页面上的范围指定了您可以攻击的子域、产品和应用程序。仔细验证公司的哪些资产在范围内，以避免在侦察和黑客过程中越界。例如，如果 example.com 的策略指定 dev.example.com 和 test.example.com 不在范围内，则不应在这些子域上执行任何侦查或攻击。
    Once you’ve verified this, discover what’s actually in the scope. Which domains, subdomains, and IP addresses can you attack? What company assets is the organization hosting on these machines?
    一旦您验证了这一点，就要发现实际上是什么范围。您可以攻击哪些域名、子域名和IP地址？这些机器上组织主持着哪些公司资产？
    WHOIS and Reverse WHOIS
    When companies or individuals register a domain name, they need to supply identifying information, such as their mailing address, phone number, and email address, to a domain registrar. Anyone can then query this information by using the
     whois
