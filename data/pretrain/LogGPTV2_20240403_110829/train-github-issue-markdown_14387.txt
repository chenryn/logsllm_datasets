I am currently exploring Apache Superset and would like to connect it to a MySQL database hosted on an EC2 instance. I have followed the installation instructions provided at [Apache Superset Installation Guide](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html) and have successfully launched Superset.

Additionally, I reviewed the documentation on [SQLAlchemy Database URLs](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/12/core/engines.html#database-urls) and used the following connection string:

```
mysql://{username}:{password}@{ip address of EC2 instance}/{database name}
```

Despite having installed the `mysql-client` library, I encounter the error "No module named 'MySQLdb'" when attempting to connect to the MySQL database.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?
