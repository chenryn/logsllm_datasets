I am exploring Apache SuperSet. I want to connect to mysql database on server
i.e., EC2 instance. I have installed all the required libraries based on
https://superset.incubator.apache.org/installation.html and launched the
superset as well.  
I did go through https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/12/core/engines.html#database-
urls.  
entered mysql://{username}:{password}@{ip address of ec2 instance}/{database
name} in the URL  
Although i have the library, yet when i try to connect the mysql it says "No
module named 'MySQLdb'". (Yes i have installed mysql-client)
Please help me with how to proceed?
