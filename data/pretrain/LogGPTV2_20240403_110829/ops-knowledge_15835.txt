User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Mapped Network Drives Persistently Requesting Credentials I run a small office network with one Windows 2008 R2 DC and eight Windows 8.1 clients connecting to it. All of the machines have computer accounts on the domain and each user has an old school logon batch file that maps two shared folders with persistence enabled. 

When a user logs into their workstation, the script runs without issue and maps the drives, however for some reason there's a red X over the drives themselves, and when I double click on the netshare, Windows prompts me to enter in the user credentials. When I do it opens the drive just fine. I've checked "Remember my credentials" but still I am prompted upon logging in or booting up.

When testing with two Windows 7 machines, I cannot replicate this issue.

Very likely I'm overlooking something stupidly obvious. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Assistant: Apply the batch file through Logon Scripts in Group Policy Management Console
