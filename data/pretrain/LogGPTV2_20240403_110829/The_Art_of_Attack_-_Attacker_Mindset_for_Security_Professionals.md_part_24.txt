leads to overall likeability. This alone increases the probability that
people will be more open to your requests and appeals. There are
other ways to get people to comply with your requests. For instance,
you could use authority. However, not everyone can be intimidated,
and even if they were, it’s not always the most effective way to get
what you want. If you can make people like you, then you have cre-
ated a path in which the fruits of your labor may last longer. This
all sounds great, doesn’t it? All you have to do to gain access to a
secured building or network, by my reckoning, is to not let your
nerves get the best of you, use your OAMs and DAMs, employ crit-
ical thought and heuristic prowess as needed, gather some intel,
walk in and place yourself in a lower position than your target, and
watch them bend to your will.
Alas, no. That would be a pretty good outcome, but this book
would then be more akin to a novel.
Ego suspension is a difficult beast to battle. That’s because
ego, no matter what flavor of it you have, is linked to who you are.
Psychology in Attacks 211
It’s a large chunk of your identity. The solution is not quite as sim-
ple as I’d like. Because ego is inseparably connected with who you
are, the act of suppressing it is often in direct conflict with your
mind’s autopilot goals. Our ego lets us believe that people see who
we are projecting ourselves to be— this is the ego’s great delusion.
Whether it be intelligent, intellectual, sharp- witted, reasoned, com-
posed, competent, nice, moral, attractive, easy- going, etc., we all
want to present ourselves in a certain way. As humans, we know
that any time we speak or engage with others, judgment typically
follows, which impacts how we are treated.
It is a natural tendency to want others to think favorably of us,
because this impacts our self- esteem. Most people have been in
a situation where a conversation has escalated to wild claims of
understanding and skill in a domain— where no matter than you
say, the person you’re talking to knows what you know but knows
it better. Perhaps you have even been this person. The stronger we
feel about a subject, the more difficult it is to maintain an air of
neutrality or ignorance. So, when you are standing in front of a top
executive in their headquarters, asking to place a USB drive into
their machine, and they say that they couldn’t possibly allow that
but that you could talk to their assistants, it can be hard to suppress
gloating and a sense of smugness, which is a form of ego.
This is why ego suspension can be so difficult— it’s your sense of
self- esteem or sense of self- importance, and it can be at odds with
someone else’s. Law 4 of AMs says everything you do is in favor of
the objective. Someone standing in the way of what’s important to
you might make suspending your ego and sense of importance dif-
ficult. But, despite how hard it can be to suspend your ego, learning
to do so is a critical skill for an EA; you will be much more effective
in your interactions.
Ego suspension is also the base for many other tools you can use as
an EA, ultimately leading to rapport and the target liking you, or at the
very least viewing you as nonthreatening. The bottom line is, help peo-
ple feel valued and they will help you; that starts with ego suspension.
Ego suspension falls firmly under self-a wareness. In Ego Is the
Enemy (Portfolio, 2016), author Ryan Holiday explores how ego
212 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
hinders our development more often than not. Our ego makes us
say, “It was just a mistake” when in fact, your ego is attempting to
protect itself by playing down your mistakes. Mistakes aren’t pat-
terns. They are typically made a couple of times, with the person
making them learning from them. Mistakes that continue to hap-
pen are flaws. Record the mistakes you make most often on jobs,
and note the reason. You can generally reduce the reasons down to
a lack of attention or focus, poverty of information, impatience, or
non suspension of ego (lack of humility).
This level of introspection will take a certain amount of self-
awareness. Self-a wareness itself is the ability and tendency to pay
attention to the way you think, feel, and behave. It is understanding
our own emotions and moods as well as how we behave and act.
Making the changes to become and stay self- aware will take humil-
ity and more self-a wareness.
Remember, self-a wareness is invisible; you cannot see if some-
one is self- aware, but you will know if they are or not because they
will leave you feeling a certain way. Think of the “friend” who
doesn’t stop talking, doesn’t ask you how you are, isn’t interested in
whatever is happening in your life at all. They only talk about their
own life, their own circumstances, and they give you their own
thoughts on matters, never asking for your input. They are most
likely not very self-a ware. When dealing with someone like this,
I often am left feeling drained and sometimes dejected.
Increasing your self-a wareness will allow you to adapt to your
circumstances, adapt to your opponent’s ego, and leave them feel-
ing the way that’s most fitting for your objective and your circum-
stances. Most often, it’s to your advantage to make someone feel
as though they helped you, not that you won. But increasing your
own self- awareness is two things: the first is difficult and the second
is never- ending. But, fear not, there are a few steps you can take
to start the journey: ask for feedback on yourself and take it well!
Choose a solid relationship in your life and start small.
Identify your cognitive distortions (essentially how we lie to
ourselves). By diagnosing the irrational thoughts and beliefs that
you unknowingly reinforce over time, you can free yourself of
Psychology in Attacks 213
them, pruning them out of your psyche. Some of the more common
ones include the Nothing Thinking/Polarized Thinking also known
as Black- and- White Thinking which results in you seeing things in
terms of extremes—you are either perfect or a total failure, etc.
Another is overgeneralization that makes you view a single
event as an invariable rule, so that, for example, if someone lets you
down once, they will always let you down. Another is Jumping to
Conclusions, also known as Mind Reading. This distortion mani-
fests as the inaccurate belief that you know what another person is
thinking. Whilst you might have an idea and be able to infer from
time to time, this distortion is tied to the pessimistic and unfavora-
ble interpretations that we jump to.
Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization, also known
as the Binocular Trick can skew how you see reality, too. This distor-
tion involves exaggerating or minimizing the meaning, importance,
or likelihood of things. A pentester who is generally savvy and sharp
but makes a mistake may magnify the importance of that mistake
and believe that they are actually not good at their job (which could
lead to or stem from imposter syndrome), while a pentester who
always performs, is agile and quick, and that can live off of the land
when tools cannot be used, may minimize the importance of their
skill and continue believing that they are simply lucky.
There’s also Emotional Reasoning which refers to the acceptance
of your emotions as fact. For easy understanding’s sake, I can reduce
it to “I feel it, therefore it must be true.” This is common, but as is
logical, feelings are not facts and they often change with nothing
more than time.
Should Statements imposed on yourself (what you “should” do
or what you “must” do) are damaging because they introduce stress,
which can lead to increased anxiety and avoidance behaviors. They
are also notably damaging when applied to others because by mak-
ing these statements, you are essentially imposing a set of expec-
tations that will likely not be met, which can lead to anger and
resentment, which is toxic in a professional or personal setting.
Control Fallacies are another category of cognitive distortion.
This distortion can manifest one of two ways: (1) that you have no
214 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
control over your life, no agency at all, and that you are a helpless
victim of fate, or (2) that you are in complete control of yourself and
your surroundings, the latter one being a distortion I am prone to.
Whichever way you lean, both are damaging, and both are
equally inaccurate. No one is in complete control of everything hap-
pens to them although I’d like to believe that we are. And no one
has absolutely no control over their situation.
The final one I will list is my least favorite and most recogniz-
able from a self-a wareness point of view: Always Being Right.
Those struggling with Imposter Syndrome or those with an
anal retentive personality may recognize this distortion—it is the
belief and truly feeling that you must always be right. Being wrong
is absolutely unacceptable, and you will fight to the figurative death
to prove that you are right.
There’s another benefit of self- awareness and ego suspension
that should be noted: your ego will tell you that you have to be the
best, you have to play your best character and role to date, you have
to best the client so that they are on their knees by the time you
depart. This is not accurate. You have to assess the client and outwit
them. That’s a game of data analysis and then acting based on the
answers. You do not have to be James Bond. You don’t have to play
complicated openings or closing moves. Don’t let your ego or your
DAMs win in those moments.
Ego will also tell you that you don’t have to go through the sew-
ers, that you will find another way in. . .or that you don’t have to
hide in the bathroom for hours on end. . .or that you won’t be the
one to get shot on the engagement where the security guards have
guns. . .or that you can pull off that southern accent. . . or that no
one else could do what you do. Don’t let ego do this to you. Use your
DAMs, not your ego, to calculate risks.
Additionally, chess players study general opening principles,
basic tactical and checkmate motifs, pawn structure, strategy, and
endgames, too. The best chess players sidestep ego. They have to. You
are never done learning chess; you will never know every move. It’s
not too dissimilar to our line of work as ethical attackers. The land-
scape will always change; the world will always be changing, and it’s
Psychology in Attacks 215
not enough just to change with it, we have to be aware of where it’s
headed, take preemptive courses of action and be okay with being
off by a few degrees, but smart enough and sharp enough to fix our
erroneous solutions.
Self- awareness in terms of ego suspension forces us to do one
other thing: ensure that you are studying material that is appropri-
ate for your level. You might have to study the basics of networks
before you start on commands. You might have to study lock pick-
ing before you start scaling buildings. Even as you progress, learning
things like bypassing alarms and using network security protocols,
you will have to be able to recall and be up- to- date with the latest
techniques for the basics.
Moreover, you will have to constantly find ways to test your
knowledge. Doing so will help you know when you can move on
to studying and practicing more complex concepts and skills, and it
will keep you honest with yourself insofar as what you retain. I rec-
ommend performing OSINT challenges, taking capture-t he-f lag and
red team courses, writing phishes and getting feedback, and gather-
ing OSINT on yourself and your loved ones.
Ego suspension and self- awareness means that before you can
get really good, you have to be comfortable being bad. It also means
that you should not be afraid to make mistakes. Get the basics, move
forward as you need to, and refresh whenever possible.
Humility
Humility isn’t just a virtue but also a trait. It heavily relates to the
degree to which we value and promote our interests above others,
and this is why it’s such a powerful weapon in an attacker’s arsenal:
it helps you adhere to the fourth law: every move made is for the
good of the objective.
Humility is also an important factor in knowing jurisdiction
over a situation does not always have to be conspicuous or explicitly
said to be felt. If you are impersonating someone who is above your
target in the hierarchy, the target will know that. You may not have
to do anything more than tell them “your” name. Explicitly making
216 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
the point that “you” are their superior is often moot. Allow them to
do some of the heavy lifting for you.
Humility also allows two other things that aren’t synonymous
with attacker but that are powerful when used by one:
• An ability to acknowledge mistakes and limitations
• Low self- focus
The last in that list ties back to law four, also. Your focus is the
objective.
Asking for Help
Sometimes, in order to influence others, you will find it prudent
and rewarding to begin with what appears to be vulnerability and
openness, which then helps your play into assistance themes.
The success of this technique relies on the human desire to help
when asked.
Mutually beneficial and altruistic behavior is common through-
out the animal kingdom, especially in species with complex social
structures. Across many studies of mammals, from mouse to man,
data suggests that we are profoundly shaped by our social environ-
ments, and we are biologically inclined to help others. Each of these
motivates people to engage in what is called prosocial behavior. So
simply asking for help can be effective, but you will need to have at
least temporarily muted your ego to ask for help and approach the
person you wish to ask with a level of humility that is moderately
conspicuous. In other words, you cannot show them your expec-
tation of help just because you are aware helping each other may
be a natural instinct. The good news is that as humans, we’re gen-
erally not good at suppressing instincts (helpful when considering
targets): the bad news is that as humans, we’re generally not good at
suppressing instincts (not helpful when considering what we have
to contend with internally as attackers).
Psychology in Attacks 217
Another Chess Parallel: Opening
Selection
Your opening is where self- awareness matters most in terms
of what is critical to the operation. If you have low self-
awareness in the recon and OSINT stages— where you don’t
know what you aren’t good at— you will fail to collect suf-
ficient information to construct a good attack. If you have
low self-a wareness in the actual execution of the operation,
you run the risk of ruining it. Unlike with OSINT, you likely
won’t get any second chances.
When it comes to your openings, three things matter
most: mental agility, self-a wareness, and your pretext. There
will likely be several options on most jobs. Your opening is
based mainly on how you approach with your pretext. The
pretext is the narrative in which you are the detail. You will
need self-a wareness and typically some degree of ego sus-
pension to pull your pretext off. You will also need mental
agility, in order to bend incoming and already known infor-
mation to fit the circumstances in which you find yourself.
Remember, you are always working in the best interests of
your objective.
Introducing the Target- Attacker Window Model
As I’ve shown, it matters more what the target thinks of you than
what you think of the target. You have to be able to read the target,
but you don’t have to be sold on their story, mainly because you
are approaching them. Their story is likely to stand. To be honest,
I don’t know if there’s a brain in the world with enough bandwidth
218 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
to run mental games of chess all the way to the moment you walk
into the target environment only to find out it’s a front.
The target for you is your obstacle—h ow they perceive you
matters immensely. The Target- Attacker Window Model (TAWM)
addresses this. Specifically, the model focuses on why snuffing out
ego is often difficult. The egotist may not know that ego exists; they
may have a skewed self- perception or be deluded by ego and false
entitlements. Not being able to identify your own ego at play is com-
mon and often invisible to the bearers. This would fall under the
“Known by target(s)” pane, which is covered in the next section,
“Four TAWM Regions.”
TAWM is based on the Johari Window model, devised by two
American psychologists named Joseph Luft and Harry Ingham.
The Johari model was produced in 1955 whilst the two men were
researching group dynamics at the University of California, Los
Angeles. TAWM is made up of four panes and is a simple and use-
ful tool for illustrating the attacker’s vantage point as well as the tar-
get’s. It can be used for much more than just identifying ego and, by
extension, identifying ways to suppress it. This model can be used
to assess and improve an attacker’s ability to further disguise them-
selves and to gain the upper hand through knowledge. The model
can also be used for understanding and training self-a wareness,
development, and target- attacker dynamics.
Four TAWM Regions
The TAWM window is a technique that helps ethical attackers bet-
ter understand their relationship with themselves and their targets.
It’s made up of four quadrants that visualize the attacker’s known
or unknown information.
Known by All What is known by the attacker about themselves
and is also known by others
Known by Target(s) What is unknown by the attacker about
themselves but that others know

Hidden What the attacker knows about themselves that others
do not know
Unknown by All What is unknown by the attacker about them-
selves and is also unknown by others
The TAWM window, depicted here, is based on a four- square grid.
