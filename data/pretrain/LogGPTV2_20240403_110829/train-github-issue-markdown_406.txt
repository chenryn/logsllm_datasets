Use case: for classifiers with predict_proba I like to see precision/recall
data across different probability values. This would be really easy to return
from current cross_validation.py master if not for  
if not isinstance(score, numbers.Number):  
raise ValueError  
in _cross_val_score  
with this changed to a warning, cross_val_score can do the check before
converting scores to np.array, and return plain list for incompatible types.
