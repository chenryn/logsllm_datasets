### Influence of Probing Location

Our analysis suggests that the specific location from which probing is conducted does not have a significant impact on the results. To validate this, we established two test-boxes in the United States: one in Seattle on the West Coast and another in Ashburn on the East Coast. Additionally, we set up test-boxes in Tokyo, Japan, and Wellington, New Zealand. Comparing the results from these locations, we found that in 93.75% of cases, the probing location did not influence the outcomes.

Across three measurement campaigns, only 0.55% of cases showed differences between the locations during all three campaigns. This small proportion of our pingable IP addresses, especially considering potential measurement artifacts such as inaccurate IP to AS mapping or ICMP-related issues, indicates that the differences are not statistically significant. We observed differences in 4.2% of cases during one campaign and in 1.5% of cases during two campaigns. Based on these results, we cannot claim that there are significant differences in reachability due to the probing location.

### Differences Between Locations at the IP Address Level

So far, we have discussed differences between locations on an IP address basis. However, many filtering policies are implemented at the Autonomous System (AS) level. For example, network administrators typically place bogon filters at all their border routers. While these filters affect certain prefixes, we are interested in identifying the ASes that configure these filters, not their victims. Similarly, router misconfigurations and routing instabilities often exhibit large differences on a per-AS basis. Many reachability problems can be observed at the AS granularity without delving into individual IPs.

In this context, it is beneficial to probe multiple IP addresses within an AS to compare their results. We found that for 84.9% of all probed ASes, all IPs within those ASes showed no differences between the probing locations. When differences were observed, they typically affected only a few IPs out of the set of probed IPs within that AS. This suggests that measurement artifacts are more likely to be the cause of inconsistencies between probing sites than actual differences in reachability.

### IP to AS Number Mapping

A general issue encountered during all experiments is the mapping of IP addresses to AS numbers. To determine the AS number corresponding to an IP address, one performs a lookup in BGP routing tables. However, it is common for customer routers to use upstream-facing IP addresses from their provider’s address space. Thus, when a probe enters the customer AS, the response may come from an IP address that still belongs to the provider’s address space, managed by the customer. In our dual probing experiment (Section 5.2), the ping initiated from the anchor prefix would incorrectly indicate that the customer router belongs to the provider’s AS. If the customer does not respond to the test-prefix probe but their upstream provider does, we would mis-diagnose that the provider’s IP address did not respond.

Not only does the IP to AS mapping create such issues, but changes in the advertised address space require us to monitor changes in the mappings. During the default routing experiment (Section 3), we first performed an IP to AS mapping of our IP address list in 2007 and compared it with another mapping based on BGP routing tables from RIPE and Routeviews from the same period in 2009. We noticed that on a per-prefix basis, things changed significantly from 2007 to 2009. Only 88.0% of the prefixes still had the same mapping in 2009. 7.43% of the prefixes were no longer in the BGP routing tables. In less than 0.5% of cases, a prefix showed multiple origin ASes (MOAS). MOAS prefixes are problematic because we do not necessarily know which AS number they will react to.

IP to AS number mapping can also be a general problem in the default route methodology. For example, if we probe IP1, which we have mapped to AS 1, but which actually belongs to AS 2, and we perform AS path poisoning with AS 1, IP1 would still respond (as it is administratively within AS 2), leading us to mis-classify AS 1 as having a default route.

### Choosing the Right Probing Tool

When designing an experiment based on active probing, one of the fundamental questions is which probing tool to use, such as ping or traceroute. Theoretically, ping should be sufficient if the primary concern is to determine if the probed address space has reachability towards the tested address space. However, if reachability cannot be established, neither ping nor traceroute will provide the desired information about the return path taken by the probes. Predicting the return path can be done partially by leveraging the record-route option and using forward probing from different locations [2]. The limited number of locations from which probing can be done in practice implies that guessing the reverse path of traceroutes will typically be a highly underconstrained inference problem. A tool that records the full path of the probe and its answer would solve this limitation.

### ICMP vs. UDP

When relying on ping probes, the type of packet (ICMP, UDP, or TCP) used significantly affects the likelihood of obtaining a response. We observed the responsiveness of both ICMP and UDP probes during the three measurement campaigns of the bogon filtering experiment (Section 5.2). Across the three campaigns, we found that roughly 70% of the IP addresses were reachable via ICMP, while only 30% were responsive to UDP. By comparing the unsuccessful UDP probes with the corresponding successful ICMP probes, we observed that 74% of the UDP probes stopped one hop before the destination. The UDP probes are likely filtered by firewalls or NATs before reaching the target IP address. We found that 90% of the UDP probes were filtered either at the destination hop or exactly one IP-hop before, and 98% were filtered less than two IP-hops away from the destination. We also tried TCP, but the responsiveness was even worse, around 5%, likely for similar reasons. Our results confirm the findings of [20] that ICMP probes are superior to UDP and TCP. However, the responsiveness of the IP addresses we probed differs from what is reported in [20], likely due to the different types of hosts probed. We aimed to cover as many ASes in the Internet as possible, while [20] targeted the responsiveness of routers specifically.

### Related Work

This work addresses one of the most fundamental services of the Internet: reachability. Numerous studies have explored various aspects of reachability, including the "happiness" of packets [3, 27] and pathological behaviors related to the address space, such as bogon advertisements [8, 28], hijacking [29, 30], misconfigurations [31], and DDoS attacks [32].

Most research has focused on BGP, examining issues like slow BGP convergence [34, 35], policy routing [36], BGP oscillations [37], and routing instabilities [22]. Few studies have looked at the data plane as a means of exploring the control plane, though [38] explores some issues of prefix propagation similar to our testing of a /25 prefix.

Researchers and practitioners often rely on data collected by various sources, such as CAIDA’s Skitter successor, Archipelago [11], and large BGP data collection projects like RIPE Routing Information Service [39] and Oregon RouteViews [40], or Team Cymru’s services [26]. However, available datasets have partial visibility of the Internet topology [41, 42], making it unwise to rely solely on them for debugging reachability.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we discussed the biases and practices that make reachability more complex than it appears from publicly available BGP data. Our experiments show that data-plane reachability is different from control plane visibility. Features such as default routing are common and provide alternative means for packets to reach their destination even when a route has failed to propagate widely.

We have also highlighted the need for improved methodologies when debugging reachability issues. Due to the limitations of current probing tools, building methodologies to debug reachability requires more care and effort than might be expected by the networking community. We presented two techniques that have been very useful in our context: route poisoning and dual probing.

Our work supports further research towards better assessments of data plane and control plane performance and their interactions. For instance, our results shed light on unexpected data plane behavior [3] that revealed non-trivial relationships between the data plane and the control plane.
