### TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows

#### Chapter 5 – IP Routing

**Page: 156**

**Overview:**
- The TCP/IP component in Windows uses a local IPv4 routing table to determine the route for packet forwarding.
- From the chosen route, the next-hop IPv4 address and interface are determined.
- IPv4 hands the packet to ARP to resolve the next-hop address to a MAC address and send the packet.
- Use the `route print` command to view the IPv4 routing table.

**Route Summarization:**
- Instead of using routes for every subnet in your network, you can use route summarization to advertise a summarized address prefix that includes all subnets in a specific region.
- An IPv4 host is configured with a default gateway. Static routers are configured with either subnet routes or summarized routes, while dynamic routers exchange routing information with neighboring routers.

**Network Address Translator (NAT):**
- A NAT is an IPv4 router that translates IP addresses and TCP/UDP port numbers as packets are forwarded.
- NAT allows a small network to share a single public IPv4 address.

**IPv6 Routing:**
- The IPv6 component in Windows uses a local IPv6 routing table to determine the route for packet forwarding.
- From the chosen route, IPv6 determines the next-hop IPv6 address and interface.
- IPv6 hands the packet to the Neighbor Discovery process to resolve the next-hop address to a MAC address and send the packet.
- Use the `route print` or `netsh interface ipv6 show routes` command to view the IPv6 routing table.

**IPv6 Host Configuration:**
- IPv6 hosts automatically configure themselves with routing information based on Router Advertisement messages.
- Use `netsh interface ipv6` commands to manually enable and configure routers running the IPv6 component to advertise address prefixes and routes.

**IP Routing Tools:**
- **Route and Netsh:** Manage IP routing tables.
- **Ping:** Test basic reachability.
- **Tracert:** Show the path a packet takes from source to destination.
- **Pathping:** Test for link and router reliability in a path from source to destination.

**Chapter Glossary:**
- **Default Gateway:** The IPv4 address of a neighboring IPv4 router. Configuring a default gateway creates a default route in the IPv4 routing table.
- **Default Route:** A route that summarizes all possible destinations and is used when no more specific routes are found. For IPv4, it has a network destination of 0.0.0.0 and netmask of 0.0.0.0. For IPv6, it has the address prefix ::/0.
- **Direct Delivery:** Delivery of an IP packet by an IP node to the final destination on a directly attached subnet.
- **Distance Vector:** A routing protocol technology that propagates routing information in the form of an address prefix and its "distance" (hop count).
- **Host Route:** A route to a specific IP address. For IPv4, it has a 32-bit prefix length; for IPv6, it has a 128-bit prefix length.
- **Indirect Delivery:** Delivery of an IP packet by an IP node to an intermediate router.
- **Link State:** A routing protocol technology that exchanges routing information consisting of a router's attached subnet prefixes and their assigned costs.
- **Longest Matching Route:** The algorithm used to select the routes in the routing table that most closely match the destination address of the packet being sent or forwarded.
- **NAT (Network Address Translator):** An IPv4 router that translates addresses and ports when forwarding packets between a privately addressed network and the Internet.
- **Next-Hop Determination:** The process of determining the next-hop address and interface for sending or forwarding a packet, based on the contents of the routing table.
- **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF):** A link state-based routing protocol for use within a single autonomous system.
- **Path Vector:** A routing protocol technology that exchanges sequences of hop information that indicate the path for a route.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** A distance vector-based routing protocol used in small and medium-sized networks.
- **Route Summarization:** The practice of using address prefixes to summarize the address spaces of regions of a network, rather than using the routes for individual subnets.
- **Router:** An IPv4 or IPv6 node that can forward received packets that are not addressed to itself.
- **Router Advertisement:** For IPv4, a message sent by a router that supports ICMP router discovery. For IPv6, an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery message sent by a router that typically contains at least one Prefix Information option.
- **Router Discovery:** For IPv4, the ability of hosts to automatically configure and reconfigure a default gateway. For IPv6, a Neighbor Discovery process in which a host discovers the neighboring routers on an attached link.
- **Static Routing:** The use of manually configured routes in the routing tables of routers.
- **Supernetting:** The obsolete use of route summarization to assign blocks of Class C address prefixes on the Internet.

**Chapter 6 – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**

**Abstract:**
- This chapter describes the details of DHCP and its use to automatically allocate unique IPv4 address configurations to DHCP client computers.
- Network administrators must understand how DHCP works to correctly configure the components of a DHCP infrastructure.
- The chapter also covers IPv6 address autoconfiguration, DHCPv6, and the use of the Ipconfig tool to manage IP configurations.

**Chapter Objectives:**
- Describe the function of DHCP.
- Explain how DHCP works.
- Install and configure the DHCP Server service.
- Configure a DHCP scope, a superscope, and scope options.
- Describe the function of DHCP user and vendor classes.
- Install and configure a DHCP relay agent.
- Describe how IPv6 address autoconfiguration works.
- Describe how DHCPv6 works.
- Configure a DHCPv6 scope.
- Install and configure a DHCPv6 relay agent.
- Use the Ipconfig tool to view IP configurations and manage DHCP-allocated IPv4 address configurations.

**DHCP Overview:**
- DHCP is a TCP/IP standard that reduces the complexity and administrative overhead of managing network client IPv4 addresses and other configuration parameters.
- A properly configured DHCP infrastructure eliminates the configuration problems associated with manually configuring TCP/IP.
- A DHCP infrastructure consists of:
  - **DHCP Servers:** Computers that offer dynamic configuration of IPv4 addresses and related configuration parameters to DHCP clients.
  - **DHCP Clients:** Network nodes that support the ability to communicate with a DHCP server to obtain a dynamically leased IPv4 address and related configuration parameters.
  - **DHCP Relay Agents:** Network nodes, typically routers, that listen for broadcast and unicast DHCP messages and relay them between DHCP servers and DHCP clients.

**DHCP Client Requests:**
- When a DHCP client starts, it requests IPv4 addressing information from a DHCP server, including:
  - IPv4 address
  - Subnet mask
  - Additional configuration parameters, such as a default gateway address, DNS server addresses, a DNS domain name, and WINS server addresses.
- If a DHCP client cannot contact a DHCP server, it may use an alternate configuration, such as an APIPA address or a manually configured alternate configuration.

**Benefits of Using DHCP:**
- **Manual Configuration:**
  - Incorrect configuration can lead to network problems, such as duplicate IP addresses or incorrect subnet masks.
  - Moving to another subnet requires manual reconfiguration.
- **Automatic Configuration:**
  - Users no longer need to acquire IP address configurations from a network administrator.
  - DHCP clients automatically receive the correct IP address configuration for the attached subnet.
  - As long as the DHCP server is correctly configured, all DHCP clients will be configured correctly.

**How DHCP Works:**
1. **Initialization:** The DHCP client sends a DHCPDiscover message to find DHCP servers and obtain a valid IPv4 address configuration.
2. **Offer:** All DHCP servers that receive the DHCPDiscover message and have a valid IPv4 address configuration send a DHCPOffer message back to the DHCP client.
3. **Selection:** The DHCP client selects an IPv4 address configuration and sends a DHCPRequest message to all DHCP servers, requesting the use of the selected configuration.
4. **Acknowledgment:** The selected DHCP server assigns the IPv4 address configuration to the DHCP client and sends a DHCPAck message. The client then initializes the TCP/IP protocol on the interface and can use all TCP/IP services and applications.

**DHCP Messages and Client States:**
- **Client States:**
  - Initializing
  - Selecting
  - Requesting
  - Bound
  - Renewing
  - Rebinding
- **Messages:**
  - **DHCPDiscover:** Sent from client to server.
  - **DHCPOffer:** Sent from server to client.
  - **DHCPRequest:** Sent from client to server.
  - **DHCPAck:** Sent from server to client.
  - **DHCPNak:** Sent from server to client.
  - **DHCPDecline:** Sent from client to server.
  - **DHCPRelease:** Sent from client to server.
  - **DHCPInform:** Used by Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 to request and obtain information from a DHCP server, such as detecting authorized DHCP servers and obtaining updated DNS and WINS server addresses.
