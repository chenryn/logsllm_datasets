User: I need to be able to switch back and forth between Python 2 and 3. How do I do that using Homebrew as I don't want to mess with path and get into trouble.
Right now I have 2.7 installed through Homebrew.
Assistant: Alternatively, you probably can just enter "python3" to run your most current version of python3.x and "python" or "python2" to run the latest installed 2.x version.
