At the moment:
    class Article {
       @Relation
       author: OneRelation;
    }
emits:
    __metadata('design:type', OneRelation)
My suggestion is that that instead of just type it would also include the type
args.
Maybe something like this:
    __metadata('design:type', {type: OneRelation, args: [{type: User, args: []}])
With the latter i don't have to repeat myself in decorator that this is a one
relation to user as i have already specified this in type.
Thanks,
