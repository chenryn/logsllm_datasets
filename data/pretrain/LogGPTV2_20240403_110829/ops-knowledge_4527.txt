User: I'm in a red hat environment.
I need to move a file from server A to server B when a file is available in a folder F.
THere's no constraint on the method used. Is it possible to trigger this event in python or any other scripts?
It could be run as a daemon but I'm not sure how to do that.
Any advices?
Assistant: This is a job for cron. Cron man, man cron!
