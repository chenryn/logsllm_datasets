as a volunteer relay operator), to layer three or four switches
(network nodes that forward IP or TCP/UDP trafﬁc), or by
monitoring Internet exchange points (IXP). We assume that the
adversary can manipulate time measurements, i. e., can hold
back replies to increase the measured RTT of a connection.
Note that a global adversary serves as a theoretical upper
bound and can capture traces at arbitrary nodes; in this case,
geographical avoidance is without effect.
E. System: DeTor
In 2017, Li et al. [31] proposed DeTor as a system to
provide provable geographical avoidance in Tor. The core
principle is comparing the measured RTT of a Tor circuit with
a lower bound threshold that includes the trip to the forbidden
area. If the measured RTT does not exceed the threshold, the
respective forbidden area could not have been reached. In other
words, the additional distance, and hence time, required to
traverse the forbidden area is higher than the measured RTT
would allow. This concept was originally introduced in the
context of Alibi Routing [29], where single hops were checked
and later extended to three-hop connections to ﬁt the needs of
Tor.
When estimating the lower bound, DeTor ﬁrst calculates
the minimal geographical distance Dmin required for routing

through the forbidden area and, second, relates it to a trans-
mission speed of 2/3c, which is an estimation of the maximal
speed of Internet connections. Considering an established Tor
circuit, DeTor calculates the following threshold:
Rmin =
· min

2c
2 · Dmin(c, F, e, m, x, s)
2 · Dmin(c, e, F, m, x, s)
2 · Dmin(c, e, m, F, x, s)
2 · Dmin(c, e, m, x, F, s)
,
(2)
where c, s are client and server, e, m, x are entry, middle, and
exit relays of Tor, and F is the forbidden area. To obtain
geographical positions, DeTor performs a Geo IP lookup with
the respective IP address of relays.
When deciding whether a Tor circuit avoided a forbidden
area, a binary decision on the measured RTT Re2e is performed
against the calculated threshold Rmin:
avoided =
(1 + δ) · Re2e < Rmin
(1 + δ) · Re2e ≥ Rmin
,

with δ being a static overhead parameter in the range between
[0, 1] designated to compensate network inconsistencies and
measurement noise. Whenever a measured RTT Re2e is shorter
than the DeTor-estimated threshold Rmin, the circuit is proven
to avoid a forbidden area.
III. CHALLENGES OF GEOGRAPHICAL AVOIDANCE
We begin our work with a systematic evaluation of the
challenges of geographical avoidance, i. e., we identify fun-
damental inﬂuencing factors that deﬁne the performance and
security of an avoidance system. We introduce three classes
of challenges (see Table I), namely (i) network diversity
that leads to heterogeneous transmission characteristics, (ii)
a lack of ground truth information that complicates avoidance
decisions, and (iii) the restrictions of a realistic deployment.
In the following, we provide a detailed introduction of these
three classes of challenges and complement our theoretical
claims with the results of a preliminary measurement study
that addresses the characteristics of Tor and the underlying
network. Throughout this work, the set of challenges will guide
our design of a new avoidance concept and later also dictate the
requirements that a practical prototype implementation must
satisfy.

A. Network Diversity
Tor’s circuit establishment procedure and the transmission
characteristics of the underlying network directly inﬂuence
the end-to-end timing of transmissions. Diverse network in-
frastructures can be one crucial inﬂuencing factor for such
varying conditions that have major consequences for timing-
based avoidance systems. We identify the following avoidance
challenges related to network diversity.
1) Skewed Relay Distribution. The worldwide distribution
of Tor relays is skewed towards countries with a higher
number of Tor supporters. The biased relay distribution
can induce performance impairments when an avoidance
decision excludes a high number of nodes.
2) Connection Lengths. The network infrastructure might
enforce certain routes for a connection, e. g., in cases
where the path between countries is forced to travel
through a trans-atlantic cable. Along with the skewed
distribution of relays this inﬂuences the length of a
connection, which also affects its timing characteristics.
3) Connection Failures. Permanent and temporary parti-
tions in the network infrastructure affect the availability of
routes and different circuits. Such partitions force trafﬁc
through speciﬁc routes and can hinder the avoidance of
a forbidden area.
All these characteristics address the complex infrastructure
of Tor. An avoidance system must incorporate such varying
transmission characteristics and provide a ﬂexible decision
mechanism that reduces the negative effects of incorrect de-
cisions. An incorrect decision can either lead to collateral
damage in cases where conservative security is preferred over
performance, or accept critical connections that might harm a
user.
1) Skewed Relay Distribution: We analyze the characteris-
tics of one consensus ﬁle and derive the distribution of relays
and their performance (please refer to Table III for a detailed
overview of all measurement setups). The majority of Tor
relays runs in Europe, where multiple countries are located
within a comparably small area (see Table II). This inﬂuences
the choice of relays and renders avoiding speciﬁc countries
within Europe more challenging. We see that 72 % of all relays
are operated in the EU2 and 21 % run in NA; the remaining 7 %
are distributed over all other continents. The same applies to
the bandwidth offered, i. e., EU provides 81.5 % of the overall
bandwidth, NA has 17 %, and all other continents provide no
more than the remaining 1.5 %. As the Tor relay selection is
weighted towards higher bandwidth nodes, we ﬁnd the most
prominent choices for relays in Europe.

Protocol Network protocol used in measurements. ICMP messages sent as
standard ping, TCP messages sent through Tor circuits using a reply server,
Handshakes are offsets between initial and ﬁnal NTor handshakes.
Target Where probes were sent to. Relays are single relay nodes from the
consensus; weighted circuits are Tor standard circuits where we do not
interfere with the relay selection; art. circuits are artiﬁcial circuits we build
from selected relays using the control port.
Servers Number of servers we use for conducting measurements. ICMP mea-
surements originate from all servers, as they do not depend on a reply server;
TCP measurements depend on a reply server and we split the set of servers
into senders and receivers
Nodes Number of nodes addressed in a measurement; we use a ﬁltered
consensus where all relays provide the Stable and Running ﬂags. We use
this ﬁltered consensus to analyze the distribution of relays (§III-A1). ICMP
measurements send pings directly to these nodes; TCP measurements use
Tor circuits, hence, the nodes summarize the relays used to build circuits.
Weighted circuits are built from whatever Tor selects, artiﬁcial circuits are
built from permutations of m × n × l entries, middles, exits.
Duration Time elapsed between ﬁrst and last measurement
in a batch of
measurements. Might include several repetitions of the same measurement.

The distribution of relays inﬂuences the overall
length
of circuits, which determines the transmission times between
clients and servers. Furthermore, a higher density of relays
and countries makes it harder to distinguish between different
countries. This leads us to an evaluation of the expected
connection lengths.
Design Goal: Overly restrictive avoidance decisions cause
collateral damage in regions with a high density of relays and
countries. We must provide a decision mechanism that does
not exclude too many relay choices.
2) Connection Lengths: The length of a circuit depends
on the client/server location and the distribution of relays
involved; the overall distance traveled in a circuit inﬂuences the
RTT of a transmission. We deﬁne the length of a circuit as the
distances (client, entry)+(entry, middle)+(middle, exit)+
(exit, server) and use approximate direct connections be-
tween all nodes from client to server of Tor standard circuits
(see Table III for experimental details).
The shortest circuits are built within Europe and the longest
circuits in North America (see Table IV for reference, combi-
nations of continents describe the client and server locations).
A closer look at the relay locations for all (NA,NA) circuits
5
reveals that none of the entry relays was located in NA,
only 14 % of circuits had a middle relay in NA, 27 % had
an exit in NA, and only 4 % of all circuits went through a
middle and exit in NA. We must assume that even though we
established a connection that was limited to NA, the circuit
traversed the Atlantic twice, which results in a high average
circuit length.
Design Goal: Varying circuit lengths lead to individual
timing characteristics. The decision threshold of an avoidance
system should consider individual characteristics for precise
decisions on different connections.
3) Connection Failures: Partitions in the network infras-
tructure inﬂuence the circuit establishment procedure on the
