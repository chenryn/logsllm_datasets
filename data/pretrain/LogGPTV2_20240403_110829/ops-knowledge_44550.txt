User: I'm using android scripting environment with python (ASE), and I'd like to terminate the shell executing the script when the script terminates.
Is there a good way to do this?
I have tried executing on the last line:
os.system( 'kill %d' % os.getppid() )
but to no avail.
Assistant: My guess is that the above answer ought to be android.Android().exit()
