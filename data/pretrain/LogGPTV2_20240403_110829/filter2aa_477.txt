#### Déjà Vu All Over Again
- **Last Year:**
  - PCI 2.0 was new and fresh but just as frustrating as PCI 1.x.
  - It lacked concrete guidance on many areas, including mobile devices and virtualization.
- **Current Status:**
  - Where are we now in terms of addressing these issues?

#### The Good
- Achieving compliance is not easy.
- Compliance does not necessarily equate to security.
- Measuring "security" is challenging, so we focus on the frequency and characteristics of incidents and compare them to PCI.
- Consider the difficulty and nature of the attacks.

#### The Bad
- Some organizations still try to cut corners and cheat.

#### The Ugly
- **Repetition of Old Practices:**
  - We are still relying on the same methods from a decade ago:
    - Firewalls
    - SSL
    - Patches (occasionally)
    - Cryptography (partially)
  - Can a WAF (Web Application Firewall) be the ultimate solution? 
    - Not likely.

#### Is History Doomed to Repeat Itself?
- We continue to use the same outdated practices, which raises the question: What can be done to break this cycle?

#### Potential Solutions
