Déjà vu all over again 
Déjà vu all over again 
Last year… 
• PCI 2.0 was new. 
• PCI 2.0 was “fresh”. 
• PCI 2.0 was just as frustrating as PCI 1.x. 
• PCI 2.0 was still lacking in concrete guidance 
on a LOT of things: 
– Mobile devices 
– Virtualization 
• So…where the hell are we now? 
The Good 
Becoming 
Compliant is not 
easy 
So what? 
Does Compliance affect “secure” at 
all? 
We don’t know how to measure 
“secure” so the best we can look at 
is the frequency & characteristics 
of incidents, and compare those to 
PCI.   
How difficult and targeted 
were the attacks? 
The Bad 
The Bad 
Sometimes people cheat 
The Ugly 
Is History Doomed to Repeat Itself? 
• We are doing the same %&$# as a decade ago. 
• Firewalls. 
• SSL. 
• Patches (maybe). 
• Crypto (sort of). 
• Can a WAF save us all!? 
– Ahem. 
The Ugly 
The Solution(s)?
