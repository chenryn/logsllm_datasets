I am currently using Odoo 8 with Python 2.7.9 (64-bit) on the Eclipse IDE. Recently, my Python installation became corrupted, and I had to reinstall it. Now, I am encountering a new issue: an `ImportError` stating that the module `win32service` cannot be found.

To resolve this, you need to install the `pywin32` package. You can do this in one of two ways:

1. **Using pip**:
   ```sh
   pip install pywin32
   ```

2. **Downloading from GitHub**:
   You can also download the latest release from the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/releases)

After installing `pywin32`, the `ImportError` should be resolved, and your setup should work as expected.
