##### Detailed description
current implementation refuses to find _any_ QR code when presented with an
image that contains more than one.
it would be nice if it could do that.
##### Steps to reproduce
    import cv2 as cv
    import numpy as np
    im = cv.imread("qrcode.png")
    det = cv.QRCodeDetector()
    rv, pts = det.detect(im)
    print("single:", rv) # True
    rv, pts = det.detect(np.hstack([im, im])) # duplicate side by side
    print("multiple:", rv) # False
