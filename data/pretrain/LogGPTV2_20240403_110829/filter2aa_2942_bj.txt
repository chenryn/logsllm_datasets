### Non-Conforming and Counterfeit Products
- **Evidence or History of Counterfeits or Non-Conforming Products**: Information related to the supplier's history of providing counterfeit or non-conforming products.
- **Suppliers’ Anti-Counterfeit Practices and Controls**: Details on the measures and controls implemented by the supplier to prevent counterfeiting.
- **Sourcing of Components from the Gray Market**: Information on whether the supplier sources components from unauthorized or unregulated markets.

### Supply Chain Relationships, Visibility, and Controls
- **Supply Chain Information**: Data about the supply chain associated with the source and/or covered article.
  - **Effective C-SCRM and Supplier Relationship Management Practices**: Evidence of robust Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) and supplier relationship management.
  - **Single Source in Upstream Supply Chain**: Identification of components or materials that originate from a single source within the upstream supply chain.
  - **Reliance on Single Trade Route**: Information on the dependency on a single trade route for supply.
  - **Product Provenance**: Details on the origin and history of the product.

### Baseline Risk Factors
Information on these baseline risk factors should generally be available from open sources, although the type, quality, and extent of information can vary widely. In some cases, no relevant information may be found, and this should be noted. Research should be tailored to obtain credible and contextually relevant information (see the discussion on information quality in the Assessment Documentation and Records Management section below). Due to these variables, it is neither possible nor desirable to standardize below the risk factor level.

### Findings and Risk Indicators
Findings related to these factors may include a mix of objective facts, threats, vulnerabilities, or general exposures. These findings, when assessed individually or in aggregate, indicate the presence or potential of risk. The findings can be positive, neutral, or negative:
- **Positive Findings**: Indicate that the source or covered article meets the desired or required assurance attributes.
- **Negative Findings**: Suggest the presence or potential of a risk that may require mitigation or further assessment.

**Caution**: The presence of one or more risk indicators does not necessarily mean that a source, product, or service poses an unacceptable risk or indicates the severity of the risk. Careful analysis is needed to determine the combination of factors and findings that may give rise to or mitigate risk concerns. Uncertainty may necessitate additional due diligence, internal or external escalation, or seeking expert advice.

### Legal and Federal Restrictions
Agencies should also examine any laws or federal restrictions that prohibit the use of certain suppliers or the acquisition of specific items, services, or materials. Below are some key lists and regulations:
1. **Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) and Blocked Persons List**: Parties designated by the Treasury Department, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), for involvement in malicious cyber activities.
2. **Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) List**: Individuals and entities operating in sectors of the Russian economy, subject to U.S. sanctions.
3. **Foreign Sanctions Evaders (FSE) List**: Individuals and entities determined to have violated U.S. sanctions on Syria or Iran.
4. **System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions**: Debarred companies excluded from federal procurement and non-procurement programs.
5. **CAPTA List**: Foreign financial institutions subject to sanctions and strict conditions.
6. **Persons Identified as Blocked**: Property and persons that must be blocked if they come within the possession or control of a U.S. person.
7. **BIS Unverified List**: Parties ineligible to receive items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by means of a license exception.
8. **NDAA Section 889**: Prohibits the procurement or use of certain telecommunications equipment or services produced by specified entities.
9. **Other Federal Restrictions or Laws**: Any other federal restrictions or laws that limit the acquisition of goods, services, or materials from a supplier.

### Risk Severity Schema
A common framework is needed to aid agencies in determining appropriate risk responses. The Supply Chain Risk Severity Schema (SCRSS) mirrors the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS) and is intended to ensure a consistent view of:
- **Severity of Assessed Risk**
- **Urgency for Risk Response**
- **Seniority Level for Decision-Making**
- **Required Information and Processes for Risk Response**

**Table E-2: Risk Severity Schema**
| Level | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 5 | Urgent National Security Interest Risk | Adversarial-related risk with imminent or present impact to national security interests |
| 4 | National Security Interest Risk | Adversarial-related risk with potential to impact national security interests |
| 3 | Significant Risk | Adversarial-related risk with potential to impact multiple agencies |
| 2 | Agency High Risk | Non-adversarial-related “high” risk associated with an agency’s critical supplier, system, component, or high-value asset |
| 1 | Agency Low or Moderate Risk | Assessed risk that does not meet the description for any of the other four risk levels |

### Risk Response Guidance
Depending on the SCRSS level, agencies may need to escalate and share information internally or externally, such as with the FASC. Supply chain risks at Levels 3 and above are characterized as "substantial risk" and require mandatory information sharing with the FASC via the Information Sharing Agency (ISA).

### Assessment Documentation and Records Management
Agencies must ensure their assessment records meet minimal documentation requirements for mandatory sharing with the FASC or for internal risk-response decisions. This includes:
- **General Information**: Agency responsible, date of assessment, and source profile.
- **Assessment Methodology**: Reference to the documented methodology and any deviations.
- **Research, Findings, and Risk Assessment Results**: Analysis of findings and rationale for risk level determination.
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential for impact given the identified risk.
- **Mitigation of Unresolved or Unacceptable Risks**: Discussion of mitigation options.
- **Risk Severity Level**: SCRSS level and explanation for the assigned level.

This documentation helps establish a robust and defensible record to support informed risk response decisions and promotes consistency in the scope and organization of documented content.
