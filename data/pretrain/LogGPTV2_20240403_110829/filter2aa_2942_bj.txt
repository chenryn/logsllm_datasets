Information about these baseline risk factors should be generally available from open sources, 
although the type, quality, and extent of information is likely to vary broadly. In some instances, 
no information may be discovered or deemed to be applicable for a given factor and should be 
noted accordingly. Research should be tailored toward attaining credible information of greatest 
relevance to the purpose and context for which the assessment is being conducted (see discussion 
about information quality in the Assessment Documentation and Records Management section 
below). Because of these variables, it is not possible nor desirable to attempt to standardize 
below the risk factor level.  
Findings associated with these factors may reflect a mix of information about objective facts, 
threats, vulnerabilities, or general “exposures” that, when assessed discretely or in aggregate, 
indicate risk being possible or present. The findings may also be positive, neutral, or negative in 
nature. Positive findings are indicative of the source or covered article having desired or required 
assurance attributes. Negative findings indicate that there is or may be a risk that presents

concern and for which a determination needs to be made as to whether the risk is within 
tolerance, requires mitigation, and/or may compel the need for information sharing with the 
FASC.  
Caution! The existence of one or more risk indicators associated with the above factors does not 
necessarily indicate whether a source, product, or service poses a viable or unacceptable risk, nor 
does it indicate the severity of the risk. Care should also be taken to analyze what combination of 
factors and findings may give rise to risk or, conversely, mitigate risk concerns. Uncertainty 
about a risk determination may prompt the need to conduct additional due diligence research and 
analysis, escalate internally or externally, or seek advice as to whether the risk is such that 
mitigation is not possible.  
Separate from or as part of the assessment, agencies should examine whether there are any laws 
or federal restrictions that prohibit the use of certain suppliers and the acquisition or use of 
certain items, services, or materials. The list below, while not inclusive of all applicable laws and 
restrictions, is focused on foreign ownership and control, other types of foreign influence, 
foreign adversaries, and foreign investment concerns that may pose risks to the U.S. supply 
chain.  
The use of such suppliers or the acquisition of such an item, service, or material from an 
individual or entity in any of the lists below is a violation of law absent an exception or waiver 
and should, therefore, be excluded from the federal procurement process. If an item has already 
been obtained prior to the below prohibitions going into effect, agencies should conduct an 
assessment to determine whether they are permitted to keep the prohibited items or services and, 
if so, whether any adversarial threats posed by continued use can be mitigated.  
1. The Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) and Blocked Persons List: The Treasury 
Department, Office of Assets Control (OFAC), through EO 13694 and as amended by EO 
13757, provided for the designation on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked 
Persons List (SDN List) of parties determined to be responsible for, complicit in, or to 
have engaged in, directly or indirectly, malicious cyber-enabled activities. Any entity in 
which one or more blocked persons directly or indirectly holds a 50 % or greater 
ownership interest in the aggregate is itself considered blocked by operation of law. U.S. 
persons may not engage in any dealings, directly or indirectly, with blocked persons. 
2. The Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) List: The sectoral sanctions imposed on 
specified persons operating in sectors of the Russian economy identified by the Secretary 
of the Treasury were done under EO 13662 through Directives issued by OFAC pursuant 
to its delegated authorities. The SSI List identifies individuals who operate in the sectors of 
the Russian economy with whom U.S. persons are prohibited from transacting with, 
providing financing for, or dealing in debt with a maturity of longer 90 days.   
3. The Foreign Sanctions Evaders (FSE) List: OFAC publishes a list of foreign individuals 
and entities determined to have violated, attempted to violate, conspired to violate, or 
caused a violation of U.S. sanctions on Syria or Iran pursuant to EO 13608. It also lists 
foreign persons who have facilitated deceptive transactions for or on behalf of persons 
subject to U.S. sanctions. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called “Foreign

Sanctions Evaders” or “FSEs.” Transactions by U.S. persons or within the United States 
involving FSEs are prohibited. 
4. The System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions: The SAM contains the 
electronic roster of debarred companies excluded from federal procurement and non‐
procurement programs throughout the U.S. Government (unless otherwise noted) and from 
receiving federal contracts or certain subcontracts and from certain types of federal 
financial and non-financial assistance and benefits. The SAM system combines data from 
the Central Contractor Registration, Federal Register, Online Representations and 
Certification Applications, and the Excluded Parties List System. It also reflects data from 
the Office of the Inspector General’s exclusion list (GSA) (CFR Title 2, Part 180). 
5. The List of Foreign Financial Institutions Subject to Correspondent Account 
Payable-Through Account Sanctions (the “CAPTA List”): The CAPTA List replaced 
the list of Foreign Financial Institutions Subject to Part 561. It includes the names of 
foreign financial institutions subject to sanctions, certain prohibitions, or strict conditions 
before a U.S. company may do business with them.   
6. The Persons Identified as Blocked: Pursuant to 31 CFR 560 and 31 CFR 560.304, 
property and persons included on this list must be blocked if they are in or come within the 
possession or control of a U.S. person. 
7. The BIS Unverified List: Parties listed on the Unverified List (UVL) are ineligible to 
receive items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by means of a 
license exception.  
8. The 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 889: Unless a waiver is granted, 
NDAA Section 889 prohibits the Federal Government, government contractors, and grant 
and loan recipients from procuring or using certain “covered telecommunication 
equipment or services” that are produced by Huawei, ZTE, Hytera, Hikvision, Dahua, and 
their subsidiaries as a “substantial or essential component of any system or as critical 
technology as part of any system.” 
9. Any other federal restriction or law that would restrict the acquisition of goods, services, or 
materials from a supplier. 
Risk Severity Schema 
A common framework is needed as a reference to aid agencies in determining an appropriate risk 
response to the results of an SCRA. This schema indicates whether an identified risk associated 
with a given source or covered article can be managed within agency-established C-SCRM 
processes or requires internal or external escalation for a risk-response decision or action.  
There is benefit in adopting and tailoring an existing government-wide severity schema as this 
creates a degree of alignment and consistency with other related processes and guidance that are 
already in use. The Supply Chain Risk Severity Schema (SCRSS) introduced and described 
below mirrors the intent and structure of the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS), which was 
developed in coordination with departments and agencies with a cybersecurity or cyber 
operations mission.

Similar to the CISS but focused on and tailored to supply chain risks versus cyber incidents, the 
SCRSS is intended to ensure a common view of: 
• 
The severity of assessed supply chain risk associated with a given source or covered 
article,  
• 
The urgency required for risk response,  
• 
The seniority level necessary for coordinating or making a risk response decision, and 
• 
The information, documentation, and processes required to inform and support risk 
response efforts.

The schema in Table E-2 is not intended to replace existing agency-established methodologies 
that describe and assign various risk levels or scores. Rather, it is to be used as a mapping 
reference that associates an agency risk assessment result to the schema level that most closely 
describes that result. Mapping gives agencies the flexibility they need to assess and describe risk 
levels in a manner applicable to their purpose and context while also creating a normalized 
lexicon to commonly describe supply risk severity across the federal enterprise. This schema 
framework also helps to communicate expectations about risk response coordination, 
information sharing, and decision-making responsibilities associated with each level. 
Risk Response Guidance 
Depending on the SCRSS level of an assessed supply chain risk, agencies may need to escalate 
and share SCRA information with others within their internal organization for further research, 
analysis, or risk response decisions or engage with external officials, such as the FASC. 
Information Sharing 
Supply chain risks assessed at Levels 3 and above are characterized as “substantial risk,” per the 
FASC rule, and require mandatory information sharing with the FASC via the Information 
NIST SP 800-161r1 
CYBERSECURITY SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT 
PRACTICES FOR SYSTEMS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
248 
This publication is available free of charge from: https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1 
Sharing Agency54 (ISA) for subsequent review and potential additional analysis and action. At 
their discretion, agencies may choose to voluntarily share information concerning identified 
Level 2 or Level 1 risks with the FASC supply chain, in accordance with FASC information-
sharing processes and requirements.  
SCRI that is identified or received outside of an assessment process may also compel the need 
for mandatory or voluntary sharing with the FASC or another government organization, such as 
the FBI, FCC, or DHS CISA. Examples of such information include but are not limited to 
information about a supply chain event, supply chain incident, information obtained from an 
investigatory organization (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), or an anonymous tip received 
through an agency hotline.  
All information sharing that occurs between an agency and the FASC, whether mandatory or 
voluntary, is to be done in accordance with FASC-established information sharing requirements 
and processes consistent with the authorizing statute and regulations. Additionally, agencies 
should designate a senior agency official to be the liaison for sharing information with the FASC. 
Agencies should establish processes for sharing (sending and receiving) information between the 
agency and the FASC and establish commensurate requirements and processes tailored to their 
organization for sharing SCRI within their own organization. 
Note: The FASC may issue updated or additional guidance concerning the circumstances and 
criteria for mandatory and voluntary information sharing. Agencies should refer to and follow 
the most current FASC guidance.  
Risk Response Escalation and Triaging 
Agencies are reminded of the importance of integrating SCRM into enterprise risk management 
activities and governance, as covered extensively in the main body and appendices of NIST SP 
800-161, Rev. 1. For risk that is determined to be at a SCRSS substantial level, it is necessary to 
escalate the risk assessment information to applicable senior level officials within the agency, 
including legal counsel. Agencies should also ensure that appropriate officials have sufficient 
security clearances to allow them to access classified information, as needed and appropriate, to 
inform or support risk response coordination, decisions, or actions.  
Because a risk deemed to be substantial is adversarial in nature, there may also be law 
enforcement, counter-intelligence equities, legal implications, or existing activities that need to 
be considered prior to responding to the assessed risk or engaging or communicating with the 
source. Agencies’ sharing of substantial risk information with the FASC standardizes and 
streamlines the process that agencies should follow to ensure these risks are “triaged” 
appropriately.  
54 The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), acting primarily through the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency, has been designated to serve as the FASC’s ISA.  The ISA performs administrative information sharing functions 
on behalf of the FASC, as provided at 41 U.S.C. 1323 (a) (3).kk

ASSESSMENT DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDS MANAGEMENT 
Content Documentation Guidance 
Agencies need to ensure that their assessment record satisfies the minimal documentation 
requirements described in this section for the mandatory sharing of information about sources 
and/or covered articles to the FASC or when escalating internally for risk-response decisions that 
may implicate the use of an agencies’ Section 4713 authority. This documentation baseline 
standard helps to ensure that a robust and defensible record is or can be established to support 
well-informed risk response decisions and actions. It also helps to promote consistency in the 
scope and organization of documented content to facilitate comparability, re-usability, and 
information sharing. 
The documentation requirements extend beyond capturing risk factor assessment information 
and include general facts about who conducted the assessment and when, identifier and 
descriptive information about the source and covered article, citation of the data sources used to 
attain assessment information, an assignment of a confidence level to discrete findings and 
aggregate analysis of findings, and noting assumptions and constraints.  
Agencies should also have and follow a defined assessment and risk determination methodology. 
This methodology should be documented or referenced in the assessment record concerning a 
given source and/or covered article. Any deviations from the agency-defined methodology 
should be described in the general information section of the assessment record.  
As information is researched and compiled, it needs to be organized and synthesized to cull out 
and document relevant findings that align with the varying risk factor categories. Sourced 
information (including contextual metadata), especially notable findings of risk of concern, 
should retain or be retrievable in a form that retains its informational integrity and considered as 
supplemental content that may be required to support and defend a risk response decision or 
action. As such, the sources for, the quality of, and the confidence in the sourced information 
need to be considered as part of the assessment activity and documented accordingly. Broadly, 
quality information should be timely, relevant, unbiased, sufficiently complete or provided in-
context, and attained from credible sources.   
Documentation requirements should be incorporated into existing, relevant supply chain risk 
assessment policies, processes, and procedures. These requirements should be informed by 
consultation with and direction from officials within the agency, to include legal counsel and 
personnel with responsibilities for records management, CUI and classified information 
management, and privacy.  
While a format is not specified, the minimal scope of content and documentation for a given 
assessment record should include the content described in Table E-3 below:
