I am currently in the process of installing `psycopg2` for use within Eclipse with Python, and I have encountered several issues. Here is a detailed account of the problems and the steps I took to resolve them:

### Issue 1: `pg_config` executable not found
When I ran the command:
```sh
sudo pip3.4 install psycopg2
```
I received the following error message:
```
Error: pg_config executable not found.
```
**Solution:**
I resolved this issue by adding the PostgreSQL bin directory to my PATH:
```sh
export PATH=/Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/bin/:$PATH
```

### Issue 2: Missing `libssl.1.0.0.dylib` and `libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib`
After successfully installing `psycopg2`, I encountered an `ImportError` when trying to import it in my project:
```
ImportError:
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so,
  Library libssl.1.0.0.dylib
  Library libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib
```
**Solution:**
I created symbolic links to the required libraries:
```sh
sudo ln -s /Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib
sudo ln -s /Library/PostgreSQL/9.4/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/lib
```

### Issue 3: Symbol not found: `_lo_lseek64`
After the previous fixes, I encountered another `ImportError`:
```
ImportError:
  dlopen(/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so,
  2): Symbol not found: _lo_lseek64   Referenced from:
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so
  Expected in: /usr/lib/libpq.5.dylib  in
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/lib/python3.4/site-packages/psycopg2/_psycopg.so
```
**Solution:**
I discovered that my `libpq.5.dylib` file was located in `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/lib`. Therefore, I created a symbolic link to this file:
```sh
sudo ln -s /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/lib/libpq.5.dylib /usr/lib
```

### Additional Information
- **Operating System:** macOS Yosemite
- **PostgreSQL Version:** Postgres.app (Version 9.4)
- **Framework:** Django

These steps resolved the issues, and `psycopg2` now loads properly in my project. If you are facing similar issues, ensure that the paths to your PostgreSQL libraries match those specified in the symbolic links.
