User: I have a fair number of smaller projects / libraries that I have been using over the past 2 years.  I am thinking about moving them to Google Code to make it easier to share with co-workers and easier to import them into new projects on my own environments.  The are things like a simple FSMs, CAN (Controller Area Network) drivers, and GPIB drivers.  Most of them are small (less than 500 lines), so it makes me wonder are these types of things too small for a stand alone open-source project?
Note that I would like to make it opensource because it does not give me, or my company, any real advantage.
Assistant: Do not think about number of lines of code, think about utility of your code. If your code is useful for somebody, upload your code to a repository or repositories, write wiki, examples, etc. I saw a useful Python library that was less than 100 lines.
