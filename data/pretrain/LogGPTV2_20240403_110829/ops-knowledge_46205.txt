**User:**
I have downloaded and unzipped the Cabot (a Python tool) on my Linux system. However, I am unsure how to proceed with the installation. In the Cabot folder, there is a `setup.sh` file. When I try to run it with `build` or `install`, it doesn't work. What should I do?

**Assistant:**
The `setup.sh` file is a shell script, which you can execute directly. To do this, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `setup.sh` file, and run the following command:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

If you encounter any errors, please provide the error messages for further assistance.
