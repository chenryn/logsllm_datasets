# Environment
- Windows Build Number: 10.0.18363.476
- PowerToys Version: 0.13.0
- PowerToy Module: FancyZones

# Steps to Reproduce
1. Run PowerToys with the FancyZones module.
2. Use the application for a period of time.
3. Press number keys on the main keyboard (not the Numpad).

# Expected Behavior
- The numbers should appear in the active text field or application.

# Actual Behavior
- Pressing the number keys triggers the following actions:
  - `1` maximizes the window to full screen.
  - `2` switches to the first custom zone.
  - `3` switches to the third custom zone.
- No numbers appear in the active text field or application.
- Disabling the FancyZones module resolves the issue, but re-enabling it causes the program to crash.

# Additional Notes
- This issue only occurs after using the application for some time.
- The problem does not occur when the Numpad is used instead of the main keyboard.
