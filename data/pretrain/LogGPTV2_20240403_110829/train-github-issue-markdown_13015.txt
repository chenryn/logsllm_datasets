# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.476
    PowerToys version: 0.13.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
After running PowerToys with FancyZones for a period of time, pressing number
keys on the main keyboard (not Numpad).
# Expected behavior
Numbers would appear on the field.
# Actual behavior
1 would full screen, 2 would switch to first custom zone, 3 would switch to
3rd custom zone setting.
No number appear on the field.
Turning off FancyZones fixes this issue. However, turning it back on crashes
the program.
