I have a fairly standard setup with three servers: `www`, `app`, and `db`. These are all managed using Fabric scripts, and the entire configuration is stored in a GitHub repository. I work on my local laptop, where I have a clone of the repository. When I make changes locally, I push them to GitHub and then deploy using Jenkins, which pulls from GitHub and performs the deployment.

The issue I'm facing is that I often end up with a large number of commits, many of which are just minor fixes for typos or small errors. This results in a cluttered commit history, which is not ideal. While the round trip to GitHub isn't a major concern, the sheer number of commits is problematic. Once these commits are pushed, they cannot be squashed, leading to an unprofessional-looking commit history.

Directly editing files on the servers is not feasible because the files are spread across multiple directories, and maintaining clones of the GitHub repository on each server would be impractical. Writing scripts to synchronize the servers with my local repository would also be overly complex, given the effort already invested in the Fabric scripts.

Simply pulling from GitHub via Jenkins isn't a viable solution either, as it still requires me to commit changes first, leading to the same problem of a messy commit history.

Does anyone have any suggestions for a more elegant way to manage this workflow?

**Suggested Solution:**

To address this issue, consider the following steps:

1. **Local Testing and Validation:**
   - Before committing, thoroughly test your changes locally to catch and fix typos and other minor issues.
   - Use tools like linters, formatters, and automated tests to ensure code quality before pushing.

2. **Interactive Rebase:**
   - Before pushing to GitHub, use `git rebase -i` (interactive rebase) to clean up your commit history. This allows you to squash, edit, or delete commits, resulting in a cleaner and more professional history.
   - For example, you can combine multiple small typo fixes into a single commit.

3. **Feature Branches:**
   - Work on feature branches rather than the main branch. This allows you to experiment and make multiple commits without affecting the main branch.
   - Once the feature is complete and tested, you can merge it into the main branch with a clean commit history.

4. **Pre-Commit Hooks:**
   - Set up pre-commit hooks to automatically run linters and tests. This helps catch issues before they are committed, reducing the need for multiple small commits.

5. **Pull Requests:**
   - Use pull requests to review and merge changes. This provides an opportunity to clean up the commit history before merging into the main branch.

By implementing these practices, you can maintain a clean and professional commit history while still ensuring that your changes are thoroughly tested and validated.
