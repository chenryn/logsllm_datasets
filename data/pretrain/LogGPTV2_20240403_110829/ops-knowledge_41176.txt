User: I have a standard-ish setup.  Call it three servers - www, app and db, all fed from fabric scripts, and the whole on github.
I have a local laptop with the repo clone.  I change a file locally, and push it to github then deploy using jenkins - which pulls from github and does its business.  The problem here is I can put a dozen rubbish commits up till I manage to fix all my typos.
Its not so much the round trip to github that matters, but the sheer number of commits - I cannot squash them as they have been pushed.  It looks ugly.  It works sure but it is ugly.
I don't think I can edit on the servers directly - the file are spread out a lot, and I cannot make each directory on three servers a clone of github and hope to keep things sane.
And trying to write scripts that will synch the servers with my local repo is insane - fabric files took long enough.
I cannot easily git pull from jenkins, because I still have to commit to have jenkins pull, and we still get ugly ugly commit logs.
I cannot see a graceful way to do this - ideas anyone.
Assistant: The solution is quite simple: make cleaner commits (fix typos before committing, only commit changes that belong together, not for too small edits). It's a bit odd that you don't take the time to fix typos (by running/testing locally) but wish to reduce the number of commits by some other means.
