ABSTRACT
A number of previous measurement studies [10, 12, 17] have
shown the existence of path exploration and slow conver-
gence in the global Internet routing system, and a number
of protocol enhancements have been proposed to remedy the
problem [21, 15, 4, 20, 5]. However all the previous measure-
ments were conducted over a small number of testing pre-
ﬁxes. There has been no systematic study to quantify the
pervasiveness of BGP slow convergence in the operational
Internet, nor there is any known eﬀort to deploy any of the
proposed solutions.
In this paper we present our measurement results from
identifying BGP slow convergence events across the entire
global routing table. Our data shows that the severity of
path exploration and slow convergence varies depending on
where preﬁxes are originated and where the observations are
made in the Internet routing hierarchy. In general, routers
in tier-1 ISPs observe less path exploration, hence shorter
convergence delays than routers in edge ASes, and preﬁxes
originated from tier-1 ISPs also experience less path explo-
ration than those originated from edge ASes. Our data also
shows that the convergence time of route fail-over events
is similar to that of new route announcements, and signif-
icantly shorter than that of route failures, which conﬁrms
our earlier analytical results [19]. In addition, we also devel-
oped a usage-time based path preference inference method
which can be used by future studies of BGP dynamics.

INTRODUCTION
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing pro-
tocol used in the global Internet. A number of previous
analytical and measurement studies have shown the exis-
tence of BGP path exploration and slow convergence in the
operational Internet routing system, which can potentially
lead to severe performance problems in data delivery [10, 12,
17]. Path exploration suggests that, in response to path fail-
ures or routing policy changes, some BGP routers may try a
number of transient paths before selecting a new best path
or declaring unreachability to a destination. Consequently,
a long time period may elapse before the whole network
eventually converges to the ﬁnal decision, resulting in slow
routing convergence. An example of path exploration is de-
picted in Figure 1, where node C’s original path to node
E (path 1) fails due to the failure of link D-E. C reacts
to the failure by attempting two alternative paths (paths 2
and 3) before it ﬁnally gives up. In a typical route failure
event, some BGP routers can spend up to several minutes
exploring a large number of alternate paths before declaring
a destination unreachable.
The analytical models used in the previous studies tend to
represent worst case scenarios of path exploration [10, 12],
and the measurement studies have all been based on con-
trolled experiments with a small number of beacon preﬁxes.
In the Internet operational community there exist various
diﬀerent views regarding whether BGP path exploration and
slow convergence represent a signiﬁcant threat to the net-
work performance, or whether the severity of the problem,
as shown in simulations and controlled experiments, would
be extremely rare in practice. A systematic study is needed
to quantify the pervasiveness and signiﬁcance of BGP slow
convergence in the operational routing system, which is the
goal of this paper.
In this paper we provide measurement results from the
BGP log data collected by RouteViews and RIPE [25, 24].

For all the destination preﬁxes announced in the Internet, we
cluster their BGP updates into routing events and classify
the events into diﬀerent convergence classes. We then char-
acterize path exploration and convergence time of each class
of events. The results reported in this paper are obtained
from BGP logs of January 2006, which are representative
of data we have examined during other time periods. The
main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• We provide the ﬁrst quantitative assessment on path
explorations for the entire Internet destination pre-
ﬁxes. Our results conﬁrmed the wide existence of path
exploration and slow convergence in the Internet, but
also revealed that the extent of the problem depends
on where a preﬁx is originated and where the obser-
vation is made in the Internet routing hierarchy. When
observed from a top tier Internet service provider (ISP),
there is relatively little path exploration, and this is
especially true when the preﬁxes being observed are
also originated from some other top tier ISPs. On the
other hand, an observer in an edge network is likely to
notice a much higher degree of path exploration and
slow convergence, especially when the preﬁxed being
observed are originated from other edge networks. In
other words, the existing widely diﬀerent opinions on
the extent of path exploration and slow convergence
may be a reﬂection of where one takes measurement
and which preﬁxes are being examined.
• We provide the ﬁrst measurement and analysis on the
convergence times of route change events in the en-
tire operational Internet, without artiﬁcially manipu-
lating path lengths as done in previous measurements.
Our results show that route fail-over events, where the
paths move from shorter or more preferred ones to
longer or less preferred ones, has much shorter conver-
gence time than route failure events, where the desti-
nations become unreachable. Moreover, we ﬁnd that,
on average, the durations of various route convergence
events take the following order: among all routing
events, those moving from longer or less preferred to
shorter or more preferred paths, symbolically denoted
as Tshort events, have the shortest convergence delay,
which are closely followed by new preﬁx announce-
ments (denoted as Tup event), which in turn have sim-
ilar convergence delay as the routing events of moving
from shorter to longer paths (denoted as Tlong). Fi-
nally, route failure events, denoted as Tdown, have a
substantially longer delay than all the above events.
In short, we have Tshort  5 minutes. After the above two steps of preprocessing,
beacon updates are mainly comprised of those triggered by
the scheduled beacon activity at the origin ASes.
To assess the degree of path exploration for all the preﬁxes
in the global routing table, we used the public BGP data col-
lected from 50 monitoring points by RIPE [24] and Route-
Views [25] collectors during the month of January 2006. We
then removed from the data all the updates that were caused
by BGP session resets between the collectors and the moni-
tors, using the minimum collection time method described in
[29]. Those updates correspond to BGP routing table trans-
fers between the collectors and the monitors, and therefore
should not be accounted in our study of the convergence
process.
The 50 monitors were chosen based on the fact that each
of them provided full routing tables and continuous rout-
ing data during our measurement period. One month was
chosen as our measurement period based on the assump-
tion that ISPs are unlikely to make many changes of their
interconnectivity within one month period, so that we can
assume the AS level topology did not change much over our
measurement time period, an assumption that is used in our
AS path comparison later in the paper.
2.2 Clustering Updates into Events
Some of the previous BGP data analysis studies [23, 6,
7] have developed a timer-based approach to cluster routing
updates into events. Based on the observation that BGP

updates come in bursts, two adjacent updates for the same
preﬁx are assumed to be due to the same routing event if
they are separated by a time interval less than a threshold
T . A critical step in taking this approach is to ﬁnd an appro-
priate value for T . A value that is too high can incorrectly
group multiple events into one. On the other hand, a value
that is too low may divide a single event into multiple ones.
Since the root causes of beacon routing events are known,
and the beacon update streams contain little noise after the
preprocessing, we use beacon preﬁxes to ﬁnd an appropriate
value for T .
Figure 2 shows the distribution of update inter-arrival
times of the eight beacon preﬁxes as observed from the 50
monitors. All the curves start ﬂattening out either before
or around 4 minutes (the vertical line in the ﬁgure). If we
use 4 minutes as the threshold value to separate updates
into diﬀerent events, i.e. T = 4 minutes, in the worst case
(rrc01 beacon) we incorrectly group about 8% of messages
of the same event into diﬀerent events; this corresponds to
the inter-arrival time diﬀerence between the cutting point of
the rrc01 curve at 4 minutes and the horizontal tail of the
curve. The tail drop of all the curves at 7200 seconds corre-
sponds to the 2-hour interval between the scheduled beacon
preﬁx activities 1.
Although the data for the beacon updates suggests that
a threshold of T = 4 minutes may work well for grouping
updates into events, no single value of T would be a perfect
ﬁt for all the preﬁxes and all the monitors. Thus we need
to assess how sensitive our results may be with the choice
of T = 4 minutes. Figure 3 compares the result of using
T = 4 minutes with that of T = 2 minutes and T = 8 min-
1The psg01 curve reaches a plateau earlier than the other
curves, indicating that it suﬀers less from slow routing con-
vergence. However one may note its absence of update
inter-arrivals between 100 seconds and 3600 seconds, fol-
lowed by a high number of inter-arrivals around 3600 sec-
onds. As hinted in [17], this behavior could be explained by
BGP’s route ﬂat damping, and one hour is the default max-
imum suppression time applied to an unstable preﬁx when
its announcement goes through a router which enforces BGP
damping.
