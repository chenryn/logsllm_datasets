ported effects of the attack on users. Most severely, 43%
of respondents reported that their work (n = 56) and per-
sonal computers (n = 8) had been infected, and the ma-
jority reported disruptions of varying severity; only 15%
(n = 22) were reportedly unaffected by the incident. In
total, 31% (n = 47) of respondents said they experienced
some type of data loss during the attack, which 25%
(n = 37) are personal or work related: 16% (n = 24) were
able to recover it through backups and 15% (n = 23)
experienced permanent data loss. Restoring access to
essential services/computers reportedly took more than
three days for the majority 64% (n = 96) of respondents;
however, 25% (n = 37) had services/computers restored
within a day and 12% (n = 18) did not lose access at all
or did not use the affected resources and services. We
also asked respondents to estimate the magnitude of the
attack. Responses highlight some of the confusion sur-
rounding what was really happening on campus. Esti-
mates ranged from 5 to 50,000 infected computers, with
a median response of 500.
Personal and social impact:
Other impacts on re-
spondents included the loss of productivity and time
for restoring ﬁles and resources, and emotional effects,
such as stress. Figure 2 captures the emotional impact
of the attack on respondents as summarized from an

open-ended question. Prominent feelings evoked by the
cyber-attack were “worried” and “concerned” about per-
sonal and work data, “frustrated” and “annoyed” about
the loss of productivity and poor communication, and
“shocked” and “surprised” that a large university could
be breached. Respondents said data loss was their great-
est fear during the attack (n = 51). This is followed
by the fear of unauthorized access or theft of personal
and ﬁnancial information (n = 38). Some were con-
cerned about negative consequences of lost productivity
(n = 27), such as missing deadlines, and others worried
about infected/encrypted computers (n = 17).
5.2 Risk Perception
One side-effect of such incidents is individuals’ shaken
conﬁdence in the organization and increased risk percep-
tion. When asked, 57% of respondents (n = 86) believed
the university could have prevented the attack. Most re-
spondents said they were not worried about cybersecurity
attacks before the incident (M = 2.5, SD = 1.2), but their
worry increased after the attack (M = 3.5, SD = 1.1).
We now report on a series of questions relating to re-
spondents’ risk perception before, during, and after the
attack. Respondents felt least vulnerable before the at-
tack, followed by a sharp spike in concern during the
attack.
In the weeks following the attack, the level of
concern dropped but respondents remained wary or un-
sure, pointing to the lingering effects of such incidents.
Likelihood of compromise: We ﬁrst asked about the
likelihood of compromise for various services, data, and
computers, on a scale of 1 = very unlikely to 5 = very
likely. Results are summarized in Figure 3. Before the
attack, all services, data, and resources were perceived
as unlikely to be compromised (M = 2.1 to 2.6). Natu-
rally, the perceived likelihood of compromise was high-
est during the attack (M = 2.5 to 4.2), with all univer-
sity resources perceived as vulnerable. The perceived
risk reduced somewhat after the attack (M = 2.7 to 3.8)
but remained above neutral for all university resources.
The two resources not managed by the university, mo-
bile devices and personal computers, were considered
least vulnerable, suggesting that respondents attributed
the increased risk directly to the organization’s resources
as opposed to generally increasing their wariness.
Prior work on users’ computer security behaviour in
an organizational context suggests that users’ behaviour
relating to secure choices is based on users’ perception
of the risk [4, 28]. In this incident, respondents viewed
the attack and associated risks as directed at the uni-
versity rather than individual users. The implication of
the perceived negligible risk to individual users suggests
that large-scale cyber-attacks on organizations may not
signiﬁcantly change end-users’ security behaviour in the
long term. We elaborate on the effect of the attack on
end-users’ security behaviour in Section 5.3.
Conﬁdence in security measures: Respondents’ con-
ﬁdence in the university’s ability to protect their data on
the university network was somewhat conﬁdent before
the attack (M = 3.8, SD = 1.1), doubtful during the at-
tack (M = 2.5, SD = 1.2), and nearly neutral (M = 2.8,
SD = 1.3) post-attack. Following a similar pattern, re-
spondents felt secure connecting to the university’s wire-
less network before the attack (M = 4.0, SD = 1.1), inse-
cure during the attack (M = 2.1, SD = 1.1), and neutral
post-attack (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2).
To mitigate risks, respondents said they were likely to
follow the security advice from the university’s comput-
ing services; and this remained largely constant before
(M = 3.9, SD = 1.1), during (M = 4.2, SD = 1.1), and
after the attack (M = 4.1, SD = 1.1).
5.3 Security Practices
We asked respondents about their security practices be-
fore, during, and in the weeks following the attack to
determine whether the attack inﬂuenced their practices.

Figure 4: Security measures taken within 24hrs.
Figure 5: Source of “network interruption” notiﬁcation.
Respondents’ primary security practices prior to the
attack were backing-up ﬁles (n = 56) manually or au-
tomatically (e.g., saving on a network drive backed up
by the university daily), avoiding clicking on suspicious
links or ﬁles (n = 36), using security software such as an
antivirus (n = 34), using strong passwords (n = 26), and
periodically changing passwords (n = 23). Twenty-one
percent (n = 32) said they had no personal security prac-
tices and relied entirely on the university’s computing
services for securing their computers. For context, we
note that all university-managed computers run antivirus
software, but some groups opt to manage their own sys-
tems, and individuals may also use their own computers
on campus. Among other security measures, the univer-
sity also had a relatively stringent password policy.
Respondents reported a clear increase in “emergency”
measures to protect resources in the 24 hours after the at-
tack, often at the cost of productivity. Figure 4 shows the
most common actions were disconnecting from the wire-
less network (n = 111), avoiding university services (n =
101), turning off Windows computers (n = 95), chang-
ing passwords (n = 94), disconnecting from the wired
network (n = 78), and backing-up data (n = 56). Some
engaged in running (n = 41) and updating (n = 31) an-
tivirus software, and turning-off mobile devices (n = 31).
A few respondents using Mac (n = 23) and Linux (n = 8)
operating systems also turned off their computers.
In the longer term, security practices of 42% (n = 63)
of respondents were unchanged by the attack. Others
backed up data more frequently (n = 24), avoided sav-
ing on local drives (n = 16), changed their passwords
(n = 15), and made other small changes (n = 32). There
was a slight increase in respondents’ rate of data backup,
with 73% (n = 109) backing-up at least once a month
after the attack compared to 66% (n = 99) prior.
We asked whether the incident had encouraged re-
spondents to learn more about cybersecurity; most were
indifferent (M = 3.3, SD = 1.0). Respondents felt that
this rather signiﬁcant incident was ‘something that hap-
pened’ which was out of their control and saw little need
to increase their cybersecurity knowledge in response.
5.4 Communication
We asked respondents when and how they learned about
the attack. Sixty-nine percent of participants said they
ﬁrst learned about the “network interruption” (as it was
initially called) before noon on the day of the attack
(n = 104). The rest found out later that day (n = 27),
or could not precisely recall (n = 19). Figure 5 shows
how users ﬁrst discovered the “network interruption”.
The majority were informed through word-of-mouth or
through the news and social media. Only 12% (n = 18)
said they were ﬁrst notiﬁed ofﬁcially by the university.
Many respondents were somewhat dissatisﬁed with
the ofﬁcial university communications during the attack
(M = 2.6, SD = 1.3). In particular, they felt the infor-
mation provided did not address their speciﬁc concerns
(M = 2.4, SD = 1.3), and reassured them only a lit-
tle (M = 2.1, SD = 1.2). They found the communica-
tion somewhat confusing (M = 2.4, SD = 1.3), and felt
it neither decreased (M = 2.2, SD = 1.2) nor increased
their worry (M = 2.4, SD = 1.2). The information did
not help respondents understand what they should do
(M = 2.6, SD = 1.3), or inform them of preventive steps
they should take in the future (M = 2.3, SD = 1.2).
During and after the attack, half of respondents at-
tempted direct communication with the university’s IT
staff for information. Respondents reported in-person
communication (n = 35), email (n = 27), phone calls
(n = 41), and leaving voice messages (n = 19). The
remaining 49% (n = 73) of respondents had no direct
communications with the IT staff. Respondents tried a
variety of methods to stay informed, primarily relying
on word-of-mouth. Sixty-seven percent (n = 97) said
they acquired information from friends, fellow students,
faculty, or other colleagues. Social media (n = 87) and
mainstream news (n = 59) were also frequent sources. To
access ofﬁcial details, respondents checked the univer-
sity’s website (n = 81), read emails from computing ser-
vices (n = 70), received updates from their departments
(n = 67), and checked internal IT websites (n = 16).
Only 10% of respondents (n = 15) believed the univer-
sity managed the situation surrounding the attack well
USENIX Association
27th USENIX Security Symposium    1065
and their most frequent concerns surrounded commu-
nications. Forty-eight percent of respondents (n = 72)
believed that communication during and after the at-
tack could be improved, and that there is a need for a
clear cyber-attack emergency response and communica-
tion plan. Respondents offered speciﬁc suggestions, but
generally, they simply needed more information, more
frequently. Fifty-nine percent (n = 89) believed the sit-
uation should have been made public immediately or as
soon as possible, instead of masquerading as a “network
interruption”. Within internal communication, respon-
dents wanted clear details about the problem (n = 31),
speciﬁc and consistent instructions about what to do
(n = 21), more frequent updates (n = 15), and over-
all improvements to the emergency notiﬁcation system
(n = 15). Respondents expected a median of 5 status up-
dates per day during the ﬁrst 24 hours after an attack,
twice per day for the next few days, and once a week
during the following weeks.
5.5 Paying the ransom
When asked about the maximum ransom the university
should pay, 55% percent (n = 83) of respondents said
that the university should pay $0. Of those who felt a
paying might be appropriate, maximum values ranged
from $100 to $1,000,000. In related Likert-scale ques-
tions, most reiterated that the university should not pay
the ransom, neither for unlocking all of the infected com-
puters (M = 1.8, SD = 1.2), nor for unlocking only com-
puters that contained important ﬁles (M = 2.0, SD = 1.4).
Respondents were against paying the ransom because
they were unsure whether the attackers would unlock the
ﬁles (M = 3.1, SD = 1.3). However, if the university did
not pay, many were also uncertain whether the university
could recover lost data (M = 2.8, SD = 1.3).
5.6 Technical vs. non-technical users
Using Welch’s t-tests, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect
in most cases between the respondents with and with-
out technical backgrounds, except on 5 survey questions:
non-technical respondents felt signiﬁcantly more secure
connecting to the university’s wireless network before
the attack (t(56) = −2.62, p < 0.05). Non-technical re-
spondents were signiﬁcantly more likely to follow rec-
ommended protective advice before (t(52) = −2.52, p <
0.05), during (t(52) = −2.6, p < 0.05), and after the at-
tack (t(51) = −2.95, p < 0.005). Lastly, the information
received from the the university was signiﬁcantly more
confusing to non-technical users than those with techni-
cal backgrounds (t(70) = −2.56, p < 0.05).
5.7 Survey summary
Our survey results revealed two main dimensions of the
attack’s impact on respondents from the affected orga-
nization. First, the majority of the university commu-
nity suffered technological disruptions that ranged from
temporary loss of access to permanent data loss. The
majority of respondents who lost access to essential ser-
vices/computers lost more than three days of productiv-
ity. This is an indirect cost that is difﬁcult to quantify,
particularly when also considering the impact on stu-
dents. Second, we identiﬁed that a crypto-ransomware
attack on an organization has a great personal and so-
cial impact on its end-users. The strong negative feelings
described by our respondents suggest that the personal
and social implications of such incidents are as signiﬁ-
cant and noteworthy as technological ones.
Our respondents’ risk perception before, during, and
after the attack suggests that an attack on an organization
increases users’ perceptions of risk relating to the organi-
zation during the attack, yet it has marginal effects on the
perceived risk of personal resources/computers. Our sur-
vey results conﬁrm prior research [28]; perceived suscep-
tibility to risk is a likely determinant for users’ computer
security behaviour. Most security behaviour changes we
observed were “reactive” rather than “proactive” and oc-
curred within 24 hours of the attack. Our results suggest
that most users are unlikely to change their computer se-
curity behaviour in the long-term because they believe
cyber-security attacks on organizations are out of indi-
vidual users’ control.
In the event of a cyber-attack, our respondents iden-
tiﬁed that communication is paramount to an effec-
tive cyber-attack response. The quality, frequency, and
promptness of information disseminated affected respon-
dents’ perceived competency of the organization and
