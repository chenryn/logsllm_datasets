User:  Please answer the following questions. What should I do if there are too many TCP TIME_WAIT sockets?
Assistant: By modifying the Linux kernel parameters, the number of TIME_WAIT sockets on the linux server can be reduced. 1. Enable SYN Cookies: net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 2. Enable reuse: net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1 3. Enable fast recycling: net.ipv4 .tcp_tw_recycle = 1 4. Set the time for FIN-WAIT-2 state: net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 30 5. Set the sending frequency of Keepalive messages: net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 1200 6. Modify the port range for outgoing connections: net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 1024-65000 7. Increase the length of the SYN queue: net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 8192 8. Set the maximum number of TIME_WAIT sockets: net.ipv4.tcp_max_tw_buckets = 5000
