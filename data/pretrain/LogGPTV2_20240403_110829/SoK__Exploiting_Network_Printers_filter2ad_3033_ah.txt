have started to introduce the possibility to install custom
software on their devices. The format of such ‘printer apps’
is proprietary, and Software Development Kits (SDKs) are
usually not available to the public but, instead, are intended
for resellers and contractors only. One popular example
is NSi AutoStore6 which can be installed on many MFPs
and automatically uploads scanned or copied documents
to predeﬁned locations. Common software platforms are
Chai/OXP (HP), EIP (Xerox/Dell), MEAP (Canon), BSI
(Brother), eSF (Lexmark), XOA (Samsung), ESA (Ricoh),
HyPAS (Kyocera/Utax), bEST (Konica Minolta), e-Bridge
(Toshiba), OSA (Sharp), and sXP (Oki). Obviously,
the
feature to run custom code on a printer device is a potential
security threat.
Even though most of the major printer and MFP man-
ufacturers allow their devices to be extended by third-party
applications, research on the proprietary software platforms
is still vague. The only published work is an early analysis
of HP’s Chai platform which has been conducted in [26].
They managed to bypass the signature veriﬁcation using an
alternate loader and execute arbitrary Java bytecode. As it
seems, code signing was completely dropped by HP for later
Chai versions. We were able to write and execute a proof-
of-concept printer malware which listens on port 9100 and
uploads incoming documents to an FTP server before print-
ing them. Our code is based on the work of Tsow [60] who
extended the device to support load-balancing and included
the required SDK ﬁles and proprietary Java libraries in their
demonstration. With the libraries, arbitrary Java code can be
complied and executed on the HP LaserJet 4200N and the
HP LaserJet 4250N by uploading the .jar ﬁles to a ‘hid-
den’ URL: http://printer/hp/device/this.loader.
Installing the malware requires knowledge of the embed-
ded web server password. However, this can be readout
using PostScript or bypassed by restoring factory defaults
as shown earlier. We cannot make a reasoned statement on
the security of other software platforms without access to
the SDK and/or proper technical documentation.

9.5. Beyond printers
Fax channels. Telefax messages are transmitted in the
form of audio-frequency tones. They can be sent to any
telefax-capable device available over the telephone system.
Therefore, they could potentially be used to bypass typical
company protection mechanisms like TCP/IP ﬁrewalls or in-
trusion detection systems, and execute malicious commands
on printers or MFPs in internal networks.
In the middle of 1990s Adobe introduced ‘PostScript
fax’ as a language supplement [9], allowing compatible
devices to receive PostScript ﬁles directly via fax. This
enables an attacker to use an ordinary telephone system as
a channel to deploy malicious PostScript code to a printer.
Unfortunately (from an attacker’s perspective), PostScript
fax never established itself and was only implemented in a
handful of devices. Telefax messages are nowadays typically
transmitted as graphical images.
BadUSB printer. Although network support is more or
less standard, many printer devices are still connected to a
single host via traditional USB A-B cables. Given we have
code execution on a printer or raw write access to the USB
device – for example, via PostScript – it may be possible
to emulate a USB stick to boot from, or a keyboard to
inject keystrokes interpreted by the host. Such HID payload
attacks from malicious USB sticks have been demonstrated
in [45]. Technically, these attacks can be performed from
any connected USB device like a printer. If such an attack is
successful, it would have an immense potential. A malicious
print job could then lead to code execution on the host
itself. Therefore, ‘BadUSB printers’ should be considered
as a potential threat and a future research opportunity.
10. Conclusions
We presented a methodology and attack scenarios for
printer devices. We showed that printers are an interest-
ing and valuable attack target. Devices with up-to-date
ﬁrmwares can still be attacked with simple attacks, which
have been known for more than a decade. The attacks we
presented allow an attacker to execute simple DoS attacks,
access printing jobs, or even to get into company networks.
This shows that printer manufacturers do not take the se-
curity incidents seriously, or are lacking proper security
analysis tools.
On top of our methodology and evaluation, we proposed
new methods improving the attacks by using modern web
techniques like CORS. We showed that printer related issues
can affect services like Google Cloud Print (GCP). Unfor-
tunately, we were unable to ﬁnd out how the usage of a
concrete PostScript interpreter in GCP can be enforced. In
other words, we were not able to ﬁnd a deterministic way to
enforce the usage of the GCP interpreter, local interpreter, or
printer interpreter. This issue can and should be addressed in
future researches on this topic. Similar services are offered
by Apple’s AirPrint [10] and Epson [25], and should be
evaluated as well.

Besides cloud printing technology, we successfully ana-
lyzed website interpreters or 3D printers. We stress that our
methodology and attack models are also important to areas
beyond printer devices. Our results are of a high importance,
for example, to IoT devices, especially in the light of the
recent security incidents. IoT devices are lacking security,
which makes them easy attack targets for organized attackers
exploiting this fact for building IoT botnets [28]. Defense
and security analyses of these devices should be followed
in future research. Our methodologies and results could also
be used as a foundation for these purposes.
