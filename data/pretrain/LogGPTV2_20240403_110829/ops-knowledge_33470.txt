Assistant: This log chunk shows a series of fatal errors occurring in the kernel of a system. The errors include machine check enable, floating point exception mode, program interrupt, byte ordering exception, data address space, core configuration register, guaranteed instruction cache block touch, and program interrupt with fp cr field.
