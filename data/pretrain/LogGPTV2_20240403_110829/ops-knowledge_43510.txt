User: Seems that even after unchecking the option in the PyDev/Debug preferenecs pane to launch in the background, once it's launched I have to go to task manager to kill the python process.
Assistant: This often happens when you're using something like cherrypy/django and the process restarts after you've changed a python file while it's running. When this happens, I think the process is different but still using the same output console and thus won't be killed when you press the red button. 
I'm not sure there's a way of fixing it, except for disabling auto-restarting in the web framework etc.
