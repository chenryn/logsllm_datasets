Assistant: Write a crawler program in Python to grab information from the website and store it in the database. The specific implementation steps are as follows: 1. Import the required library ``` import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import sqlite3 ``` 2. Define the link`` `url = 'The address of the website that needs to grab information' ``` 3. Use the requests library to get the source code of the web page ``` r = requests.get(url) ``` 4. Use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the source code of the web page``` soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser') ``` 5. Find the tag where the information to be captured is located, and extract the information ``` info = soup.find('tag name', {'attribute name': 'property value'}).text ``` 6. Connect to the database ``` conn = sqlite3.connect('database name.db') ``` 7. Create a cursor ``` c = conn.cursor( ) ``` 8. Create table``` c.execute('CREATE TABLE table_name (column_1,column_2,column_3)') ``` 9. Insert data``` c.execute("INSERT INTO table_name (column_1,column_2) ,column_3) \ VALUES ('value_1','value_2','value_3')") ``` 10. Commit changes``` conn.commit() ``` The complete program structure is as follows: ``` import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import sqlite3 url = 'The website address that needs to grab information' r = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, 'html.parser') info = soup.find('tag name', { 'Property name': 'Property value'}).text conn = sqlite3.connect('database name.db') c = conn.cursor() c.execute('CREATE TABLE table_name (column_1,column_2,column_3)') c.execute("INSERT INTO table_name (column_1,column_2,column_3) \ VALUES ('value_1','value_2','value_3')") conn.commit() ``` It should be noted that the specific code needs to be based on Adjust and modify the actual situation. At the same time, it is also necessary to protect the resources and legal use of the website to avoid violating relevant laws and regulations.
