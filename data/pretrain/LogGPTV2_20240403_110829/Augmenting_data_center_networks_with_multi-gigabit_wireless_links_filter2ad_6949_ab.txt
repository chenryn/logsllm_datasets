**Figure 4: RSS vs. Distance.** The Received Signal Strength (RSS) is relative to the transmitter power level and fits the Friis model with an exponent of 2. The signal degrades by approximately 88 dB at 10 meters.

### Phased Arrays
Phased arrays can be significantly more powerful than fixed-beam antennas because they can generate patterns with variable beam widths, control the amount and angle of side lobes, and be used in advanced ways, such as null-steering away from specific interferers [20]. Since 60 GHz phased arrays are not yet available, we simulated the radiation pattern using the commercially available Phocus phased array, which operates at 2.4 GHz, from the Geo-fencing project [25]. We do not speculate on properties like steering time for 60 GHz arrays, but prior work [17, 19] indicates that such antennas can be steered in hundreds of microseconds. Further details about the simulated Phocus array pattern and our assumptions about 60 GHz phased arrays are provided in Appendix A.

Note that the Phocus pattern has smaller back and side lobes compared to our measured directional antennas (Figure 3). This is because, in our measurements with the NB and WB antennas, we conservatively assumed that any angle with no measurable signal strength (e.g., sender facing directly away from the receiver) is just below the noise floor.

### Signal Propagation
We studied 60 GHz signal propagation in multiple environments:
1. **Atrium:** Our building's atrium, resembling a free-space environment with no walls closer than 40 meters from either end of the link.
2. **Interior Hallway:** A 1.5-meter wide hallway with multiple paths and physical obstructions.
3. **Data Center:** Across the tops of rows of racks in a production data center, similar to how wireless flyways could be deployed. This environment includes a low ceiling, rows of racks, pipes for cabling, and metal cages.

In each scenario, we set up one sender and one receiver, varying the distance between them and measuring the signal strength at the receiver at each step.

**Figure 7: Interference Experiment Results**
**Figure 8: TCP Throughput at Various Distances.** TCP throughput when both sender and receiver use directional antennas of various gains.

Interference between flyways must be mitigated for good performance. This can be achieved by using multiple channels, directional antennas at both the sender and the receiver, and carefully controlling which flyways are activated. Our system design incorporates all these techniques, with the bulk of interference mitigation occurring due to directional antennas.

To study the impact of directionality on spatial reuse, we configured two parallel links using HXI devices with NB antennas. These links use frequency division for bidirectional communication, and we configured them to maximize interference by using the same frequency for nodes facing the same direction. We separated the source and destination by 85 inches to mimic the width of an aisle and varied the separation between the links. At each position, each source sent a greedy TCP flow to its destination. The cumulative throughput (Figure 7) indicates whether the two links interfere. This prototype hardware has no MAC and uses no physical- or link-layer backoff, so the links either interfere completely or not at all. We found that parallel links closer than 24 inches interfere, but directional antennas enable coexistence with slightly more separation. Note that 24 inches is about the width of one rack, and with three available 802.11ad channels, many flyways can operate simultaneously.

### TCP Throughput Simulations
In §3.3, we saw that a 60 GHz link over an aisle can provide stable 1 Gbps throughput, limited by HXI equipment. To better understand the potential TCP throughput of a full-fledged 802.11ad link, we used packet-level simulations with the ns-3 simulator [21], which we extensively modified to model 60 GHz propagation, 802.11ad MAC, directional antennas, and data center layouts. For details on the modifications, see Appendix B.

**Figure 8: TCP Throughput at Various Distances.** The results underscore the need for directional antennas. Omni-directional antennas provide no throughput under 4 meters, but modestly directional WB antennas can provide nearly 1 Gbps of throughput between nodes 15 meters apart. With NB antennas, TCP performance barely degrades with distance because the RSSI is sufficient to use the highest encoding rate of 6.76 Gbps even at 20 meters. The performance of the Phocus array is comparable to that of the WB antenna. Arrays with more elements (e.g., 30 instead of the 8 used here, derived from [25]) should perform comparably to NB antennas.

These results show that directional antennas are necessary to achieve high throughputs over links longer than 1 meter. There is a gap between the maximum TCP throughput achieved (≈ 4 Gbps) and the highest link transmission rate (6.76 Gbps), due to various wireless MAC and TCP overheads. In Appendix C, we describe ideas to reduce these overheads by exploiting the hybrid nature of a wired data center network enhanced with wireless flyways.

### Dense Deployment of Links
In §3.4, we showed that two high-rate 60 GHz links can coexist in close proximity. Using simulations, we investigated the number of 60 GHz links that can operate simultaneously in a typical data center while still offering reasonable performance. We simulated the data center layout shown in Figure 9, based on an operational data center of a large search provider. We considered 160 racks connected to a single aggregation switch, assuming each top-of-rack (ToR) switch is equipped with a single 60 GHz device connected to a steerable antenna with specified gain. All devices operate on the same channel and may interfere.

**Figure 9: Partial Top View of Data Center.** Each row has ten 24x48 inch racks, with aisles 10 and 8 feet wide. The overall area is roughly 14 m x 14 m.

**Figure 10: Number of Flyways Operating Concurrently.** Mean and standard deviation over 100 runs.

We used the Monte-Carlo method to find maximal independent sets of flyway links [12]. Given n devices, n·(n−1) links are potentially feasible. A set of links is deemed independent if every link in the set provides some minimal throughput, even when all links in the set are active concurrently. The set is maximal if no other links can be added without violating the independence property. To test for independence, we simulated running long-lived TCP flows across the links, allowing each device to participate in only one link at a time.

For a given DC layout, the average size of the maximal independent set tells us how many flyways may be set up simultaneously, depending on the antenna used and the minimum required throughput. Figure 10 shows the average size and one standard deviation over 100 randomly generated maximal independent sets for various antenna gains and minimum throughputs. Since each ToR can participate in only one flyway, and we have 160 ToRs, the set size cannot exceed 80.

With a Phocus antenna array or NB antennas, the number of flyways that can operate together increases dramatically. If the ToRs are equipped with NB antennas, the average size of the independent set is significantly larger.
