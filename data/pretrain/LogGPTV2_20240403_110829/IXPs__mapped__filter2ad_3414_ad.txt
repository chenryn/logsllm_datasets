at IXPs. Our dataset is responsible for the bulk of it (i.e.,
44K), and the targeted traceroute method yields roughly
twice as many IXP peerings than either the BGP LG-based
method or the targeted source-routing method. In their May
2005 study, He et al. [4] reported in their paper a total of
7.7K IXP-related peerings. However, while their goal was
to discover additional links in the overall AS topology (i.e.
links that were not present in current AS maps), our goal is
more speciﬁc and aims at detecting all peerings at IXPs.
Focusing ﬁrst on the publicly available datasets, we ob-
serve that despite its large size, the CAIDA-provided tracer-
oute data is a relatively poor source, producing only 2.6K
peerings. As already noticed, the methodology to collect
these traces suﬀers from a poor coverage in terms of vantage
points. DIMES clearly has a better coverage than CAIDA
and yields 17K peerings. Note however that the DIMES
study has to be viewed as a general-purposes traceroute col-
lection eﬀort which is not optimized in any way for the pur-
pose of discovering peerings at IXPs. While such datasets
are a good starting point for detecting peerings at IXPs, the
large number of DIMES agents suggests the design of an
IXP-speciﬁc experiment that has the potential to discover
IXPs and peerings that remained invisible to our approach.
For example, if there are DIMES clients in areas where we
have no or poor coverage in terms of LG sites, traceroutes to
and from those clients are likely to reveal some of the IXPs,
their members, and peerings among those members that we
were unable to detect.
Next, relying on our dataset and techniques yields 44K
peerings, and outperforms the use of any of the publicly
available data sources. Our regular traceroutes from the
254 PlanetLab nodes produced only 8K peerings due to the
location of those nodes (generally universities, typically not
connected to IXPs) in spite of their geographical dispersion.
We discovered slightly more peerings (10.4K) in the traces
collected with LSRR traceroutes from our 30 nodes, even
though they were run from PlanetLab nodes. Since source-
routing forces probes to take a certain path before reaching
an IXP, the sources of the traceroutes have little impact on
the results. The results involving LSRR traceroutes may
be in part due to the problems of source-routing discussed
earlier. Out of 183K paths traversing IXPs, we dropped 57K
because they were incomplete in the sense that either the
router before or after the IXP address was not responding.
Compared to our regular traceroute traces where we had to
dismiss around 1.5% of the paths, for our LSRR traceroute
traces, this percentage was 31% of the interesting paths.
Fig.3 shows how using our dataset and mining it with
our techniques clearly outperforms the other methods that
rely on datasets from CAIDA, DIMES and PlanetLab. Our
method performs worse (on the right-hand side of the ﬁg-
ure) on IXPs with less than 20 peerings. Table 6 shows that
our targeted traceroute technique performs well, generating

at least twice as many peerings than the other techniques,
due to the great source diversity and the ability to launch
speciﬁcly targeted traceroutes from them. In contrast, min-
ing BGP LGs produced relatively poor results with 11K
peerings—IXPs are hard to ﬁnd in a BGP table and re-
quire the BGP LG to be installed at a router located at
the IXP. In such a case, the router will peer with other IXP
members, and their IXP-allocated address will appear in the
BGP dump. As a result we will be able to detect that the
peering is actually done at the IXP. Unfortunately, most
LGs are not located at an IXP. Being located outside an
IXP, they are of no use for us as source of informative BGP
data. On the one hand, the targeted traceroute method is
clearly superior because it depends to a lesser degree on the
LG location. On the other hand, it is slower, creates more
load on the network, and is not as accurate as the use of
BGP LGs.

The “Cost” columns in Tables 5 and 6 also give the cost
associated with the various datasets used and techniques ap-
plied. Here, we measured cost in terms of duration of the

experiments and number of queries issued during the experi-
ments. We note that as far as our techniques are concerned,
LSRR traceroute is clearly the most expensive technique,
while the use of BGP LGs yields a high number of peerings
for a very low overall cost. Although our targeted traceroute
technique is expensive in terms of time, it seems possible to
reduce this cost signiﬁcantly by more eﬀectively incorporat-
ing the results learned from previous runs of the experiment.
At the same time, it is important to keep in mind the high
failure rate of this technique.
Indeed, around 27% of the
issued queries did not complete, either because of a time-
out (4% of the queries) or because of temporarily down and
rate-limiting LGs.
5.6 Comparison with public IXP databases
Table 7 is a summary of what we could extract from the
various IXP-related databases. Recall that the quality of
these databases is largely unknown, implying that the in-
formation extracted from them may be far from the ground
truth and can at best be used to support some rough qual-
itative statements. We present this information here for
completeness. Speciﬁcally, we could extract membership in-
formation for 84 IXPs based to their DNS naming conven-
tions, resulting in nearly 2K members. Unfortunately, the
remaining IXPs either do not name their IP addresses or do
it in a way which is not easily parsable. We have seen earlier
that the data quality of the two main IXP repositories diﬀer,
with PCH showing twice as many members as PeeringDB.
In contrast, IRR yields 2K members at only 80 IXPs. Still,
the richest source for membership information are the IXP
websites themselves which provide a total of 4K members at
166 IXPs. One of the possible reasons for the diﬀerence be-
tween this number and the 3.5K members given in Table 5 is
344that networks serving content tend to peer at several IXPs.
Since we often have only a single LG in a given member,
the traceroutes run from such a LG are likely to go through
the closest IXP, thus preventing the detection of members
at other IXPs.
6. VALIDATION
6.1 Undetected IXPs
We detected 223 of the 278 IXPs with known preﬁxes. We
went through the 55 IXPs that remained invisible to the vari-
ous traceroute experiments and explain below why they were
not discovered. We collected IXP contact information from
IXP databases and websites, IRR databases, and contacted
operators, network administrators, and teams at PCH and
EP.net. We summarize our main ﬁndings and refer to the ac-
companying webpage (http://www-rp.lip6.fr/˜augustin/ixp/)
for more details.
We found that 17 of the 55 undetected IXPs are active.
Of those 17 IXPs, 11 were conﬁrmed to be active, but our
attempts to detect them failed. Regional IXPs typically al-
low traﬃc between members but forbid any transit traﬃc,
which forces members to be multi-homed. If we do not have
a LG in one of the members, we have no chance to ﬁnd
a traceroute going through the IXP. This is the case for
many of the IXPs in Africa where we have only four LGs.
We selected two African IXPs (in Swaziland and Uganda)
where we don’t have any LG in either their members or the
neighbors of their members and designed a brute-force ex-
periment using LSRR targeted traceroutes. Checking more
than 100K IP addresses, we found only four LSRR routers
in two members of the Uganda IX and none in the members
of the other IXP. Yet, none of our source-routed traceroutes
revealed the two IXPs: they were either blocked by an inter-
mediate router or experienced non-responses. We thus lack
suﬃcient information to infer the presence of an IXP that is
known to exist and be active. IXPs that fall in this category
