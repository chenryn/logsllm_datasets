Abstract
In  this  paper  we  present  a  data  dissemination 
protocol  for  efficiently  distributing  data  through  a 
sensor network in the face of node and link failures. Our 
work  is  motivated  by  the  SPIN  protocol  which  uses 
metadata  negotiation  to  minimize  data  transmissions. 
We  propose  a  protocol  called  Shortest  Path  Minded 
SPIN (SPMS) in which every node has a zone defined by 
its  maximum  transmission  radius.  A  data  source  node 
advertises the availability of data to all the nodes in its 
zone. Any interested node requests the data and gets sent 
the data using multi-hop communication via the shortest 
path. The failure of any node in the path is detected and 
recovered  using  backup  routes.  We  build  simulation 
models to compare SPMS against SPIN. The simulation 
results show that SPMS reduces the delay over 10 times 
and consumes 30% less energy in the static failure free 
scenario.  Even  with  the  addition  of  mobility,  SPMS 
outperforms  SPIN  by  energy  gains  between  5%  and 
21%.  An  analytical  model  is  also  constructed  to 
compare the two protocols under a simplified topology.

1. Introduction 
Sensor  networks  are  a  particular  class  of  wireless  ad 
hoc  networks  in  which  the  nodes  have  micro-electro-
mechanical  (MEMS)  components,  including  sensors, 
actuators  and  RF  communication  components.  Sensor 
nodes  are  randomly  dispersed  over  the  area  of  interest 
and are capable of RF communication and contain signal 
processing  engines 
the  communication 
protocols  and  data  processing  tasks.  Sensor  nodes  are 
typically  battery-powered  and  since 
replacing  or 
recharging  batteries  is  often  very  difficult,  reducing 
energy consumption is an important design consideration 
for sensor networks. 
to  manage 
Sensor  nodes  are  frequently  used  for  gathering  and 
disseminating  data  about  the  physical  conditions  of  the 
routing  protocols  with  higher 
environment  they  are  embedded  in.  This  has  spurred 
extensive  research  in  protocols  for  distributing  sensor 
data in sensor networks. Energy aware routing protocols 
optimize the number of transmissions required to set up 
routing  paths,  the  amount  of  state  maintained  at  each 
node,  and  the  cost  of  transmitting  data  packets.  There 
has  also  been  interest  in  complementing  the  network 
level 
layer  data 
dissemination protocols that take the data semantics into 
account. The objective is to minimize the transmission of 
redundant data in the network. The baseline protocol can 
be  considered  to  be  flooding  or  broadcast,  where  each 
node retransmits the data it receives to all its neighbors, 
except the neighbor that it received the data from. This is 
a  simple  protocol  that  does  not  keep  any  state  at 
intermediate  nodes  and  disseminates  data  quickly  in  a 
network.  However,  it  results  in  data  implosion  with  the 
destination  getting  multiple  data  packets  from  multiple 
paths. Also,  consider  that  two  sensor  nodes  monitor  an 
overlapping  region  of  the  environment.  The  classic 
flooding  approach  (as  any  other  low  level  routing 
protocol) cannot recognize the data overlap and optimize 
for  it  by  preventing  multiple  transmissions  of  the 
overlapping data region. 
The  protocol  called  SPIN  (Sensor  Protocols  for 
Information  via  Negotiation)  [5][10]  grew  out  of  the 
idea  that  a  sensor  node  should  handshake  with  its 
neighbors and decide on the data that it already has and 
the  data  that  it  needs  to  obtain  before  initiating  the 
operation to get the data. Nodes in SPIN label their data 
using  high-level  data  descriptors  called  meta-data  and 
use  meta-data  negotiation  to  determine  if  a  node  needs 
the 
redundant 
transmissions.  In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  protocol 
called SPMS (Shortest Path Minded SPIN) that reduces 
the  energy  consumption  and  the  end-to-end  delay  of 
SPIN.  We  achieve  this  by  using  the  fact  that  sensor 
nodes  can  operate  at  multiple  power  levels  and  once 
negotiation of meta-data is initiated, the remainder of the 
protocol and the data transfer can occur in multiple hops 
using  the  lowest  energy  level.  At  first  glance,  it 
eliminates 
therefore

would appear that SPMS would increase the data latency 
between  the  destination  and  the  source.  However,  this 
turns  out  not  to  be  the  case.  The  effect  of  reducing  the 
power  level  of  transmission  causes  a  smaller  level  of 
MAC  layer  contention  for  the  shared  wireless  channel 
and  therefore  reduces  the  MAC  layer  backoff  delay 
which  contributes  to  a  lower  overall  delay  in  SPMS. 
SPMS is also resilient to node and link failures since the 
data  is  exchanged  through  intermediate  nodes  and  they 
may  cache  the  data  to  tolerate  failures  of  the  source  or 
another  intermediate  node.  In  order  to  do  multi-hop 
routing,  we  run  a  distributed  Bellman  Ford  algorithm 
among the nodes in a zone; a zone being defined as the 
area  a  node  can  reach  transmitting  at  its  maximum 
power  level.  Each  node  maintains  routes  to  other  nodes 
in  the  zone.  In  this  paper,  we  quantify  the  cost  of  the 
algorithm  under  mobility  scenarios  where  the  Bellman-
Ford algorithm needs to be re-executed. 
We perform a theoretical analysis to show the energy 
and delay improvements. We also conduct simulations to 
show  the  improvements  over  SPIN  under  static  and 
mobility  scenarios,  with  and  without  failures.  The 
simulation results show that SPMS reduces the delay by 
a  factor  of  more  than  10  and  consumes  on  an  average 
30% less energy in the static failure free scenario.  Even 
with  the  addition  of  mobility,  SPMS  outperforms  SPIN 
by energy gains between 5% and 21%. 
The  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
section  2  we  discuss  related  work.  Section  3  describes 
our  protocol  design  and  algorithm.  In  section  4  we 
provide  a  theoretical  analysis  comparing  the  delay 
reduction  and  energy  gains  in  SPMS  over  SPIN.  In 
section 5 we provide the simulation based evaluation of 
SPMS.  Section  6  concludes  the  paper  and  addresses 
future work. 
2. Related Research 
Several  routing  mechanisms  have  been  proposed  in 
the  literature  to  address  the  data  dissemination  problem 
in  sensor  networks,  such  as,  broadcast  and  gossip.  To 
reduce  the  expense  of  routing  table  creation  at  each 
node,  Haas  and  Pearlman  [4]  have  proposed  a  zone 
routing protocol. Each node proactively maintains routes 
for  nodes  within  its  zone  and  reactively  acquires  the 
routes  to  nodes  outside  the  zone  only  when  it  needs  to 
transmit outside the zone.  
Communicating  data  in  an  energy-efficient  manner 
from a sensor node to the base station, in particular, and 
another  sensor  node  in  the  sensor  field,  in  general,  has 
received  enormous  attention  of  late.  Fusing  the  energy 
efficiency with data latency and fault tolerance concerns 
has  received  some,  but  markedly  less,  attention.  The 
current  state-of-the-art  and  the  unanswered  questions 
that  motivate  SPMS  are  summarized  here.  Hari  et.  al.
have  proposed  a  protocol  called  LEACH  [3]  where  the 
nodes  communicate  directly  with  the  respective  cluster 
head  and  the  cluster  heads  communicate  with  the  base 
station. The cluster head role is taken by different nodes, 
either in a round-robin manner or depending on the level 
of remaining energy. The protocol does not consider the 
end-to-end  latency  for  the  data  since  a  fixed  time 
division  multiplexed  schedule  is  enforced  on  the  nodes 
in  a  cluster  for  data  transmission.  It  assumes  that  all 
nodes  are  capable  of performing  direct  sequence  spread 
spectrum  communication  and  that  the  base  station  is 
within  communicating  distance  of  all  nodes.  These 
assumptions  respectively  limit  the  economic  feasibility 
and  the  scalability  of  the  solution.  The  solution  briefly 
mentioned for the scalability challenge uses a backbone 
of  cluster  heads  to  reach  the  base  station.  This  has 
several  complexities  that  need  to  be  addressed,  e.g., 
efficient  backbone  construction 
to 
constructing  a  minimum  connected  dominating  set 
which is known to be NP-Complete.  
is  equivalent 
There  has  been  follow-up  work  by  Raghavendra  et.
al.  in  a  system  called  PEGASIS  [6],  which  further 
minimizes  the  energy  by  sending  all  the  data  through 
only one node. All the cluster head data is fused and then 
only one node sends the entire data to the sink node. The 
clustering  approach  is  an  orthogonal  method  to  that  in 
SPMS  or  SPIN.  We  feel  the  clustering  approach  is 
feasible if the network has a fairly regular structure and 
the structure can be easily deduced and this information 
distributed  throughout  the  network.  Nuggehalli  and 
Srinivasan  propose  a  protocol  called  POACH  (Power
Aware  Caching  Heuristics)  [9]  where  they  address  the 
problem  of  determining  the  servers  in  a  sensor  network 
at  which  the  data  should  be  cached  so  that  the  overall 
cost  of  data  dissemination  from  the  sink  node  is 
minimized.  The  paper  provides  a  closed  form  solution 
for  deciding  the  placements  of  the  data  caches.  But  the 
paper does not address the issue of failures of these data 
caches.  Also,  placing  the  caches  at  specific  points 
requires 
to  have  more  memory  and 
computation  power,  which  further  requires  careful 
placement  of  nodes.  SAFE  [1]  is  a  protocol  for  data 
dissemination  from  stationary  sensor  nodes  to  mobile 
sink nodes. It is a pull-based protocol where a path is set 
up between a sink and the source (which the sink knows 
a priori) when the sink needs the data. If any other sink 
needs  data  from  the  same  source,  the  protocol  finds  an 
efficient path that overlaps with the previous paths from 
the source. The node nearest to the latest sink that is on 
the common path is called a junction node. This has the 
flavor  of  multicast 
the 
requestors  arrive  at  different  times.  A  concern  with  the 
protocol  is  the  amount  of  state  that  needs  to  be 
maintained  at  intermediate  nodes  (distance  from  a  large 
number  of  sources  for  all  the  flows  that  are  flowing

through  it).  Also,  the  multiple  rounds  of  message 
exchange  required  to  set  up  a  path  add  to  delay  in  the 
critical path of data dissemination (5 rounds of message 
exchange  before  a  junction  node  can  start  serving  a 
sink).  The  Two Tier Data  Dissemination  protocol 
(TTDD)  [2]  is  another  protocol  for  disseminating  data 
from stationary sensor sources to multiple mobile sinks. 
The goal is to prevent the explosion of messages due to 
the  sinks  broadcasting 
their  change  of  position 
information.  TTDD  proactively  sets  up  a  grid  structure 
for  each  data  source  with  sensors,  called  dissemination 
nodes,  having  forwarding  information  to  reach  the 
source. When a sink needs data, it floods the query to a 
local  region  and  any  dissemination  node  in  the  local 
region  picks  up  the  query  and  routes  data  from  the 
source. The cost of proactively creating and maintaining 
the  grid  structure  from  all  potential  sources  to  the  edge 
of the sensor field can be high. The sizes of the cells and 
their  setup,  which  determine  the  performance  of  the 
protocol,  are  sensitive  to  the  movement  patterns  of  the 
sinks which may be difficult to predict.  
There  has  been  considerable  interest  in  distributed 
topology  control  algorithms  that  seek  to  find  minimum 
energy paths between any two nodes in a sensor network 
[14]. The protocols find the nodes that need to be active 
for minimum energy paths between a given set of nodes, 
or the transmission power levels of the individual nodes 
to maintain certain properties such as connectivity in the 
network.  This  approach  typically  does  not  consider  the 
combination of energy, data latency, and reliability, and 
also  does  not  address  the  issues  of  data  implosion  and 
overlap which are mentioned next. 
3. SPMS Protocol 
3.1. Background: SPIN 
Hari et.  al.  [5]  have  proposed  a  class  of  protocols 
called Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation 
(SPIN)  that  is motivated  by  two problems  with  existing 
wireless  sensor  network  data  distribution  protocols  – 
Implosion,  i.e.  a  node  always  sends  data  to  its  neighbor 
irrespective  of  whether  it  already  has  it  or needs  it,  and 
Overlap, i.e. nodes often transmit redundant information 
because  of  overlap  in  their  sensing  regions.  In  SPIN, 
nodes name  their  data  using high-level  data  descriptors, 
called  meta-data.  Then,  the  source  and  the  destination 
participate in meta-data exchange prior to data exchange 
which  ensures 
information  gets 
transmitted.  A  source  node  initiates  the  meta-data 
transfer  by  sending  an  advertisement  packet  and  data  is 
sent  to  only  those  nodes  which  request  the  data  after 
seeing  the  advertisement.  Since  advertisement  packets 
are  much  smaller  than  data  packets,  SPIN  has  energy 
savings  over  the  basic  flooding  protocol.  Each  node  in 
that  only  useful 
SPIN  also  monitors  its  resource  availability  (e.g., 
available  battery  power)  and  decides  on  its  data 
dissemination  activities  accordingly,  e.g.,  if  it  would 
forward a third-party node’s packets. 
3.2. Design of SPMS 
We know from path loss models that energy spent in 
wireless communication is proportional to d(cid:302) , where d is 
the  distance between  the source  and  the  destination  and 
(cid:302) is a constant between 2 and 4. The idea that going over 
long distances incurs an exponentially increasing energy 
cost  was 
the  motivating  factor  behind  multi-hop 
communication in ad-hoc networks. This idea also forms 
the basis for SPMS. SPIN suffers from the drawback of 
transmitting all packets at the same power level and not 
using  the  distance  to  a  neighbor  to  adjust  the  power 
level. SPMS borrows the concept of meta-data exchange 
from  SPIN,  and  uses  a  multi-hop  model  for  data 
transmission among the nodes with variable transmission 
power levels.

cost associated with it which represents the 
transmission power needed to reach the 
neighbor.
to  get 
to 
However,  using  multiple  hops 
the 
destination  throws  two  major  challenges  –  knowing  the 
route  to  the  destination  and  dealing  with  failures  of 
intermediate  nodes.  Regarding  the  first  problem,  there 
have been various routing protocols proposed for ad-hoc 
networks like AODV[15] and DSR [16], and for sensor 
networks  like  directed  diffusion  [17].  Since  sensor 
networks  may  consist  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
nodes, it is infeasible to maintain a routing table at each 
node  with  routes  to  all  other  nodes  in  the  network.  To 
reduce the cost of route discovery and maintenance, we 
define  a  zone  for  each  node.  A  zone  for  a  node  is  the 
region  that  the  node  can  reach  by  transmitting  at  the 
maximum  power  level.    The  nodes  which  lie  within  a 
node’s zone are called its zone neighbors.
Each  node  in  the  network  maintains  a  routing  table 
for each of its zone neighbors. The Distributed Bellman 
Ford (DBF)  algorithm  is  executed  in  each zone  to form 
the 
the 
responsibility  of  route  calculation  among  the  nodes  in 
the zone and is therefore attractive to SPMS. Each entry 
of  the  routing  table  at  each  node  has  a  destination  field 
routes.  The  DBF  algorithm  distributes
