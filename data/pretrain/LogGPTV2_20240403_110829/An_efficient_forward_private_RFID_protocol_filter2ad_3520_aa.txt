ABSTRACT
Radio Frequency IDentiﬁers (RFID) are low-cost pervasive
devices used in various settings for identiﬁcation purposes:
although they have originally been introduced to ease the
supply chain management, they are already used in many
other applications. Some of these applications need secure
identiﬁcation and ad-hoc authentication protocols have to
be designed for that purpose. But the intrusion of RFID
in the life of end-users might additionally require a higher
level of user-privacy. Such security and privacy requirements
conﬂict with the highly constrained environment of RFID
systems. Ohkubo, Suzuki, and Kinoshita ﬁrst proposed an
appealing RFID protocol that meets the highest privacy re-
quirements. However, their scheme and its known variants
suﬀer from limitations in terms of computational complex-
ity and provable security which this paper aims to address.
We propose a novel forward private authentication scheme
built upon less computationally expensive cryptographic in-
gredients, namely pseudo-random generators and universal
hash functions instead of one way hash functions. In con-
trast with existing schemes, we provide security proofs of our
construction in the standard model instead of the random
oracle model.

INTRODUCTION
RFID is an ever spreading technology aimed to identify
items in an automated way, without the need for physical
access or line of sight. The architecture of an RFID system
basically consists of electronic tags attached to items, a set of
readers, and further data processing means—e.g. some back-
end system connected to the readers via a network possibly

easing the identiﬁcation procedure and allowing the tags to
convey much more information than bar-codes. The initial
motivation for introducing RFID tags was the simpliﬁcation
of the whole supply chain process: manufacturing, logistics,
transportation, etc. Besides, new applications are still aris-
ing as RFID technology wide-spread, among which postal
tracking, waste management, pets tracking, airline luggage
tracking, theft detection, counterfeits ﬁghting, or environ-
mental sensing to name a few.
Such various and promising applications obviously urge
the industry to vastly deploy low-cost RFID tags and with
the adoption of standards [14, 20] this deployment ever in-
creases. However, the scope of RFID applications being so
large, it often hides the diversity of security constraints. An
RFID system designed to manage a stock of goods that are
used in place does not pose the same security threats and
cost constraints as a system designed to control access to
a transportation network or meant to track pets.
In the
ﬁrst case, each tag can contain a unique number which is
identically transmitted every time the tag is queried and if
any, only a low level of security in the identiﬁcation pro-
cess is needed.
In the second case, the tags enter the life
of the end-user (attached to people or to items that they
carry around), possibly for a long period of time, asking for
a high level of privacy as expressed in the society [18, 10,
32]. This second type of tags should never allow the trac-
ing of their holder. As standard cryptographic techniques
are too resource consuming to be implemented on low-cost
RFID tags, cryptographic protocols have to be tailored to
this speciﬁc setting.
Another common requirement is to prevent impersonation
of legitimate tags that might for instance result from their
cloning or from the replay of previously transmitted data.
For this purpose, tags must be authenticated. In the sequel,
a protocol that allows to identify a tag but does not prevent
impersonation is named an RFID identiﬁcation protocol and
a protocol that allows both identifying and authenticating a
tag is named an RFID authentication protocol. The needs
for authentication and privacy coexist in many applications,
e.g. counterfeits ﬁghting, transportation tickets, etc.
A lot of eﬀorts have already been put in developing eﬃ-
cient RFID identiﬁcation or authentication protocols while
preventing tracing by third parties. However, few of them
provide forward privacy, which can be viewed as the highest
level of user privacy. As the cost of RFID renders any kind of
tamper resistant features prohibitive, the non-traceability of
items should hold even after an attacker has tampered with a
tag: logging identiﬁcation or authentication exchanges prior
43tampering would indeed allow a posteriori tracing. One of
the most appealing proposals that provide an identiﬁcation
protocol with such a high level of user privacy was made by
Ohkubo, Suzuki, and Kinoshita [29, 30]. To prevent a tag
that has been tampered with from disclosing useful infor-
mation to the attacker in terms of traceability, the authors
rely on two one-way functions: one to update the internal
state of the tag and the other to produce an identiﬁcation
value that does not allow a passive attacker to recover the
internal state of the tag. Avoine and Oechslin [6] and Vau-
denay [33] noticed that when the two functions are modeled
as random oracles (and after augmenting the scheme with
an anti-replay mechanism to provide authentication instead
of mere identiﬁcation) the security of the scheme against a
strong model of attackers—in particular, when it comes to
privacy guarantees—can be proven.
This paper builds on this previous work and proposes a
forward secure RFID authentication protocol that removes
the two main limitations of OSK’s scheme and derivatives.
We ﬁrst show by studying the actual requirements behind
the two one-way functions of OSK’s scheme that there is
no need for cryptographically strong hash functions, and
propose to use a pseudo-random number generator together
with a universal hash functions family instead. This yields
eﬃcient hardware implementations compared to previous
proposals. We then prove the security of our construction by
establishing concrete bounds in the standard model. This is
in contrast with previous work on forward private protocols
which were only proven secure in the random oracle model.
2. SECURITY MODEL
We propose simple security deﬁnitions that can be viewed
as an adaptation of the more general, but more complex
security deﬁnitions partly inspired by [5, 24, 11] introduced
by Vaudenay in [33] to a symmetric setting where each tag
is initialized with an individual secret key.
Assumptions on the authentication protocol. Every
RFID authentication protocol considered in the sequel is
symmetric. Each tag Ti has a secret internal state initialised
with a secret Ki. This secret is also known from the back-
end system (e.g. a database to which readers are connected).
We assume that the secrets Ki of the tags are uncorrelated,
i.e.
independently and randomly chosen. During its life-
time, an initialized tag can enter authentication exchanges
with a reader, following a protocol that speciﬁes which mes-
sages are to be computed and exchanged and how the in-
ternal states of the tag and the back-end system are to be
updated. An authentication exchange between a tag and a
reader either results inside the reader in an authentication
success together with a tag identity or in an authentication
failure. We also assume that a tag cannot handle several
authentication exchanges simultaneously.
Exposure periods. We consider adversaries able to track
one speciﬁc target tag during a limited time period that,
following Vaudenay in [33], we name an exposure slot or
equivalently an exposure period. During an exposure period,
an adversary is able to observe and disturb all interactions
involving a target tag Ti and possibly a peer reader without
confusing these interactions with exchanges involving other
tags of the system. After an exposure period, no physical
characteristics (e.g. radiation pattern, response times, etc.)
are supposed to allow such an adversary to recognize the
tag Ti, i.e. distinguish it from the other tags of the system
if he happens to observe it again. The requirements put on
RFID authentication schemes in this paper are the following.
2.1 Correctness
An authentication exchange involving a legitimate tag and
a reader is said to be undisturbed if all messages sent by all
parties are correctly transmitted and neither modiﬁed nor
lost in either direction. For any legitimate tag Ti, the prob-
ability that all undisturbed authentications performed by
Ti during its lifetime are successful and result each time in
the recovery by the system of the identity of Ti must be
arbitrarily close to 1. The reason why we consider the fail-
ure probability of at least one authentication in the lifetime
of Ti rather than the failure probability of every individ-
ual authentication of Ti is that our deﬁnition of correctness
must allow a legitimate tag to be “desynchronised” with the
system, rendering it unable to successfully pass some or all
subsequent authentications, provided this happens with a
negligible probability even in the presence of adversaries.
We ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of correctness in a setting where
the authentication exchanges of all legitimate tags are not
disturbed by transmission errors or by an adversary.
Definition 1. An RFID authentication protocol is said
-correct if for any legitimate tag Ti, the probability (over
the initial secrets of the legitimate tags in the system and
the random numbers used in the executions of the protocol)
that Ti is not successfully authenticated at least once in its
lifetime is upper-bounded by .
The above deﬁnition of correctness is more general and
closer to the intuitive notion of correctness than the one used
to analyse OSK in [33] which only requires an undisturbed
tag authentication performed just after the system’s initial-
ization to be successful. Our deﬁnition indeed captures the
fact that even if all authentications are undisturbed, the
acceptance of a legitimate tag potentially depends on the
interactions between the reader and other legitimate tags.
We further extend the former deﬁnition of correctness by
considering a setting where the authentication exchanges of
legitimate tags may be disturbed by a DoS adversary who
succeeds if it causes the failure of a legitimate tag’s authen-
tication attempt. Although we consider a unique adversary,
this is not restrictive since situations where transmission er-
rors occur and/or where authentication exchanges are dis-
turbed by a coalition of adversaries can be viewed as coming
from a single adversary. We introduce limitations on the ca-
pabilities of the adversary: an adversary with a running time
upper-bounded by T and able to disturb at most q authen-
tication exchanges is called a (q, T )-adversary.
Definition 2. An RFID authentication protocol is said
to be (q, T, )-correct iﬀ the probability (over the initial se-
crets of the legitimate tags in the system, the random num-
bers chosen during the executions of the protocol, and the
random number chosen by the adversary) that a legitimate
tag is not successfully authenticated by a legitimate reader in
an undisturbed exchange at least once in its lifetime is upper-
bounded by , even in the presence of (q, T )-adversary.
2.2 Security
An RFID authentication protocol is said secure if it resists
impersonation attacks. An impersonation attack proceeds in
two phases. During the ﬁrst phase (assumed, without loss
44of generality, to take place during a single exposure period)
an adversary interacts both with a legitimate reader and
a legitimate tag Ti and is allowed to trigger, observe, and
disturb or entirely replace up to q authentication exchanges
involving the tag Ti and the reader, and to access the out-
come of the authentication (success or failure). During the
second phase, he only interacts with the reader and initiates
an authentication exchange to impersonate the tag Ti. The
impersonation succeeds if the authentication is successful
and the adversary is identiﬁed as the tag Ti.
Definition 3. An RFID authentication protocol is said
to be (q, T, )-secure iﬀ for any adversary running in time
upper-bounded by T , the probability that an impersonation
attack involving at most q authentication exchanges during
phase 1 be successful is at most .
2.3 Forward privacy
Let us consider the following forward privacy experiment
involving a (q, T )-privacy adversary A with a running time
upper-bounded by T . During a ﬁrst phase, A interacts with
any two legitimate tags Ti0 and Ti1 , and a legitimate reader.
These interactions happen, without loss of generality, during
a single exposure period of Ti0 and a single exposure period
of Ti1 where the adversary is allowed to trigger, observe, and
disturb at most q authentication exchanges involving Ti0 and
(possibly) the reader and at most q authentication exchanges
involving Ti1 and (possibly) the reader. During a second
phase, A again interacts with a tag Tib randomly selected
among the two tags Ti0 and Ti1 , and b is concealed to A.
First, A is allowed to trigger, observe, and disturb at most
q additional authentication exchanges involving Tib and is
given access to the corresponding authentication outcome
(success or failure). Then, A is given access to the internal
state value of Tib . Eventually, A outputs a guess b(cid:48) for the
