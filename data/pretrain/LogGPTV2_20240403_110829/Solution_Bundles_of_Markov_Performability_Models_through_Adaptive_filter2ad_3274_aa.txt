Abstract—A technique to approximate solution bundles, i.e.,
solutions of a parametric model where parameters are treated
as independent variables instead of constants, is presented for
Markov models. Analyses based on an approximated solution
bundle are more efﬁcient than those that solve the model for
all combinations of parameters’ values separately. In this paper
the idea is to properly adapt low rank tensor approximation
techniques, and in particular Adaptive Cross Approximation,
to the evaluation of performability attributes. Application on
exemplary case studies conﬁrms the advantages of the new solution
technique with respect to solving the model for all time and
parameters’ combinations.

I. INTRODUCTION
Stochastic model-based analysis is widely adopted to study
dependability, performance and performability attributes of
complex systems, in particular computing and communication
ones. At a certain level of abstraction, such systems can be
modeled by Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) [1],
where a reward is attached to each state to support the measures
of interest in terms of reward measures [2], [3].
Here, the focus is on solving the CTMC to evaluate instant-
of-time (at a ﬁnite time) and interval-of-time (relative to an
interval of ﬁnite length) measures [1], [3] for systems of
increasing largeness and complexity. Addressing these systems
is a challenge for classical solution methods and a test bench
for new ones. In addition, accuracy of results from model-based
analysis strongly depend on the model parameters setting, and
it is often required to solve the model for different time and
parameters assignments (from now on called points in the
Cartesian product of time and parameters’ space) so further
exacerbating the difﬁculties encountered in solving the model.
Closed formulas are infeasible to be found for large models,
and both classical alternatives to model solution, i.e., numerical
analysis- and simulation- based ones, face limitations when
employed as solution subroutines. The main issue is originated
by passing points one at a time to the solution subroutine, as
shown in Figure 2a, where the model solver is called on each
point of (t, θ) to get the measure mθ(t).

The proposed application of ACA exploits efﬁcient computational strategies
to evaluate measures along time and parameters’ ﬁbers.
A step forward is to consider the semi-symbolic method
presented1 in [7], where time is symbolic and all the rest is a
numeric value, as depicted in Figure 1a, where the measure
mθ(t) is evaluated for each speciﬁc value θ(1), θ(2) and θ(3) of
the parameter θ. This way, continuity in time is maintained in
the subroutine call, but alone it is insufﬁcient to solve the issue
because combinations of parameters’ values are still passed
one by one.
The natural generalization is to transform the role of parame-
ters from “constants yet to be deﬁned” to continuous variables
(details in Section II-B) and then deﬁning the measures of
interest as continuous functions of both time and parameters.
Borrowing terminology from physics, solving a model where
parameters are made variables produces a solution bundle [8],
as depicted in Figure 1b, i.e., solutions x(t, θ) of a parametric
model where the parameters t and θ are treated as independent
variables instead of constants. Therefore, the focus of this paper
is on measure bundles, represented in Figure 1b by all the
values that the measure m(x(t, θ), t, θ) can assume for every
possible value of t, θ and x(t, θ).
Clearly, expressing exactly such functions is equivalent to
write closed formulas, and then it is infeasible in practice, but
this shift of point of view allows to approximate the measures,
and then to radically simplify data ﬂow. Now, as depicted in
Figure 2b, analysis and model solution logics are decoupled:
ﬁrst an approximation ˆm() of the measures is determined, and
then the approximation can be consumed by analyzers, that
are also able to exploit the smoothness of the approximation
(see Section II-B), to get ˆm(t, θ).
Several techniques are available to perform approximation.
