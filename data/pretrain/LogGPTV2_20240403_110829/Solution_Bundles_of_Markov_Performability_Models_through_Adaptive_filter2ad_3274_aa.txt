**Abstract:**
This paper presents a technique for approximating solution bundles in Markov models, where parameters are treated as independent variables rather than constants. This approach is more efficient than solving the model for each combination of parameter values separately. The method leverages low-rank tensor approximation techniques, particularly Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA), to evaluate performability attributes. Case studies demonstrate the advantages of this new technique over traditional methods.

**1. Introduction**

Stochastic model-based analysis is widely used to study dependability, performance, and performability attributes of complex systems, especially in computing and communication. These systems can be modeled using Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) [1], where rewards are attached to each state to support the measures of interest [2, 3].

The focus here is on solving CTMCs to evaluate instantaneous and interval-of-time measures [1, 3] for increasingly large and complex systems. Traditional solution methods face challenges with these systems, making them a test bench for new approaches. The accuracy of model-based analysis results strongly depends on the setting of model parameters, often requiring the model to be solved for different time and parameter assignments. This exacerbates the difficulties in solving the model.

Closed-form solutions are infeasible for large models, and both numerical and simulation-based methods have limitations when used as subroutines. The main issue arises from passing each point in the Cartesian product of time and parameter space one at a time to the solution subroutine, as shown in Figure 2a.

**Figure 1: Different treatment of parameters: (a) as constants, (b) as variables.**

- **(a) Parameters as constants:** The measure \( m_\theta(t) \) is evaluated for specific values of the parameter \( \theta \).
- **(b) Solution bundle:** Parameters are treated as continuous variables, and the measure \( m(x(t, \theta), t, \theta) \) is a continuous function of both time and parameters.

**Figure 2: Data flow in model solving: (a) traditional approach, (b) proposed approach.**

- **(a) Traditional approach:** Each point in the Cartesian product of time and parameter space is passed one at a time to the solution subroutine.
- **(b) Proposed approach:** An approximation \( \hat{m}() \) of the measures is determined, and analyzers can use this smooth approximation to get \( \hat{m}(t, \theta) \).

**2. Methodology**

The proposed method generalizes the role of parameters from "constants yet to be defined" to continuous variables, allowing the measures of interest to be expressed as continuous functions of both time and parameters. This produces a solution bundle, as depicted in Figure 1b. While exact expressions for such functions are infeasible, this shift in perspective allows for the approximation of measures, simplifying data flow.

Several techniques are available for approximation, and this paper focuses on using Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) to achieve this. ACA provides an efficient computational strategy to evaluate measures along time and parameter fibers, as shown in Figure 2b.

**3. Case Studies**

The application of the proposed technique to exemplary case studies confirms its advantages over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that the new solution technique is more efficient and accurate in evaluating performability attributes for large and complex systems.

**4. Conclusion**

This paper introduces a novel approach to approximate solution bundles in Markov models by treating parameters as continuous variables. The use of Adaptive Cross Approximation (ACA) significantly improves the efficiency and accuracy of model-based analysis, making it a promising tool for the evaluation of performability attributes in complex systems.
