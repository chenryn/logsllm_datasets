compilation terminated.
```

### Analysis

It appears that some necessary headers are missing in this TensorFlow release, specifically `tensorflow/compiler/xla/statusor.h`. This is likely causing the compilation to fail. 

### Recommendations

1. **Update TensorFlow**: Ensure you are using a version of TensorFlow that includes the required headers. Consider upgrading to a more recent stable version.
2. **Check Installation**: Verify that your TensorFlow installation is complete and not corrupted. You may need to reinstall TensorFlow.
3. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that all environment variables and paths are correctly set, especially if you are using custom installations or specific versions of CUDA and NCCL.

If the issue persists, please provide additional details about your setup for further assistance.
