I'm currently working on a project that requires more domain expertise in `pymongo` than I currently possess. Specifically, I need to know if the appropriate parts of the `pymongo` driver are written in Python, allowing me to call `gevent.monkey_patch()` and successfully alter `pymongo`'s blocking behavior for read/write operations within `gevent` "asynchronous" greenlets.

If this requires some additional work with `gevent` and `pymongo`, but is feasible, I am willing to invest the time, provided I can receive some guidance over IRC.

**Background:**
At a small scale, MongoDB writes are not a significant issue because we simply queue a write request before unblocking. However, discussions with Fiorix about his `twisted` asynchronous MongoDB driver (available [here](https://github.com/fiorix/mongo-async-python-driver)) have highlighted that even quick write requests can cause problems in asynchronous applications at scale. Additionally, non-blocking reads can also be problematic from the start.

**Response:**

I have experience using `pymongo` with `gevent`, and here are some key points to consider:

1. **Connection Management:**
   - Instantiate only one `pymongo.Connection` object, preferably as a global or module-level variable. This is crucial because the `Connection` object manages a connection pool internally.
   
2. **Monkey Patching:**
   - Ensure you monkey patch both the `socket` and `threading` modules. The `Connection` object uses thread locals, so patching only the `socket` module is insufficient.

3. **Resource Cleanup:**
   - Remember to call `end_request` to return the connection to the pool, ensuring efficient resource management.

To answer your question, it is indeed feasible to use `pymongo` with `gevent`. With the proper setup and attention to the points mentioned above, you should be able to achieve the desired asynchronous behavior.

If you need further assistance or have any specific questions, feel free to reach out over IRC.
