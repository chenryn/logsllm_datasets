**Issue with Misaligned Error Indicators in Rust Compiler Output**

When using non-ASCII characters (e.g., "日本语"), the error indicators (`^~~~~~~`) in the Rust compiler output are misaligned. This appears to be due to incorrect computation of character lengths.

### Example

```rust
$ rustc -v main.rs 
main.rs:3:38: 3:43 error: unresolved name `hello`
  --> main.rs:3:38
   |
3  |     println!("Hello in English: {}", hello());
   |                                      ^^^^^
   |
note: in expansion of format_args!
  --> main.rs:2:42
   |
2  |     :2:42: 2:75 note: expansion site
   |                                          ^
   |
note: in expansion of println!
  --> main.rs:1:1
   |
1  |     :1:1: 2:77 note: in expansion site
   |                                              ^
   |
main.rs:4:46: 4:53 error: unresolved name `goodbye`
  --> main.rs:4:46
   |
4  |     println!("Goodbye in Japanese(日本语): {}", goodbye());
   |                                              ^^^^^^^
   |
note: in expansion of format_args!
  --> main.rs:2:42
   |
2  |     :2:42: 2:75 note: expansion site
   |                                          ^
   |
note: in expansion of println!
  --> main.rs:1:1
   |
1  |     :1:1: 2:77 note: in expansion site
   |                                              ^
   |
error: aborting due to 2 previous errors
```

### Source Code

The `main.rs` file contains the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello in English: {}", hello());
    println!("Goodbye in Japanese(日本语): {}", goodbye());
}
```
