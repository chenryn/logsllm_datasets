Assistant: This log chunk shows the system running tasks 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 in stage 20.0, assigning tasks 821, 833, and 838, and reading broadcast variable 29. It also shows the memory store storing blocks broadcast_29_piece0 and broadcast_29, and the block manager finding blocks rdd_26_0, rdd_26_4, rdd_26_3, rdd_26_2, and rdd_26_1 locally. Finally, it shows the PythonRunner calculating total, boot, init, and finish times.
