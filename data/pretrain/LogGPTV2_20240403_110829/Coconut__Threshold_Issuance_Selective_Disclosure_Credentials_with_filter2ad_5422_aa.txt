Abstract—Coconut is a novel selective disclosure credential
scheme supporting distributed threshold issuance, public and
private attributes, re-randomization, and multiple unlinkable se-
lective attribute revelations. Coconut integrates with blockchains
to ensure conﬁdentiality, authenticity and availability even when
a subset of credential issuing authorities are malicious or ofﬂine.
We implement and evaluate a generic Coconut smart contract
library for Chainspace and Ethereum; and present three ap-
plications related to anonymous payments, electronic petitions,
and distribution of proxies for censorship resistance. Coconut
uses short and computationally efﬁcient credentials, and our
evaluation shows that most Coconut cryptographic primitives
take just a few milliseconds on average, with veriﬁcation taking
the longest time (10 milliseconds).

INTRODUCTION
Selective disclosure credentials [16], [19] allow the is-
suance of a credential to a user, and the subsequent unlinkable
revelation (or ‘showing’) of some of the attributes it encodes
to a veriﬁer for the purposes of authentication, authoriza-
tion or to implement electronic cash. However, established
schemes have shortcomings. Some entrust a single issuer with
the credential signature key, allowing a malicious issuer to
forge any credential or electronic coin. Other schemes do not
provide the necessary efﬁciency, re-randomization, or blind
