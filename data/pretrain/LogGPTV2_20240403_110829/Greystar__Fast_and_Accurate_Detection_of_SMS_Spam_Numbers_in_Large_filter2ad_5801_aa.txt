**Abstract:**
In this paper, we present Greystar, an innovative system designed to combat the increasing volume of SMS spam traffic in cellular networks. By leveraging the fact that most SMS spammers randomly select targets from a finite phone number space, Greystar monitors numbers from the grey phone space (which includes data-only devices like laptop data cards and M2M communication devices) and employs a novel statistical model to detect spam numbers based on their interactions with these grey numbers. Our evaluation, using five months of SMS call detail records from a large US cellular carrier, demonstrates that Greystar can detect thousands of spam numbers each month with very few false alarms. Additionally, 15% of the detected spam numbers have never been reported by spam recipients. Greystar is significantly faster in detecting SMS spam compared to existing methods, reducing spam traffic by 75% during peak hours.

## 1. Introduction
The proliferation of mobile devices over the past decade has led to a surge in unwanted SMS (Short Message Service) spam. According to recent reports, the number of spam messages in the US rose by 45% in 2011, reaching 4.5 billion messages [2]. In 2012, there were 350,000 variants of SMS spam messages globally [3], and more than 69% of mobile users claimed to have received text spam [4]. This high volume of spam not only annoys users but also incurs significant costs for both cellular service providers and customers.

Unlike email spam, where the number of possible email addresses is virtually unlimited, SMS spammers can easily reach victims by enumerating all numbers from the finite phone number space. This, combined with the widespread adoption of mobile phones, makes SMS a preferred medium for spammers. Furthermore, the advanced functionality of smart mobile devices enables spammers to carry out more sophisticated attacks through both voice and data channels, such as using SMS spam to lure users to malicious websites.

To mitigate the financial losses and network performance issues caused by SMS spam, it is crucial to quickly identify and restrict spam numbers before they reach a large number of victims. Traditional solutions, such as filtering based on sending patterns, often result in high false alarm rates. Therefore, cellular carriers typically rely on customer reports to alert them of emerging spamming activities. While these methods are accurate due to human intelligence, they suffer from significant delays due to low report rates and slow user responses, making them inefficient in controlling SMS spam.

To address these challenges, we conducted an extensive analysis of SMS spamming activities using five months of SMS call detail records from a large US cellular network and the spam messages reported by recipients. We found that most spammers choose targets randomly from a few area codes or the entire phone number space and initiate spam traffic at high rates. To detect such aggressive random spammers, we introduce the concept of grey phone space, which consists of grey phone numbers associated with data-only devices (e.g., laptop data cards) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication devices (e.g., utility meters). These grey numbers rarely participate in SMS communication, forming a grey territory that legitimate users seldom enter. The wide dispersion of grey numbers makes them difficult for spammers to evade.

Based on the grey phone space, we propose Greystar, a system that uses a novel statistical model to detect spam numbers based on their interactions with grey numbers and other non-grey phone numbers. Our evaluation using five months of SMS call records shows that Greystar is superior to existing SMS spam detection algorithms in terms of both accuracy and detection speed. Specifically, Greystar detected over 34,000 spam numbers in five months with only two false positives. Additionally, more than 15% of the detected spam numbers had never been reported by mobile users. Greystar reacts quickly to emerging spamming activities, with a median detection time of 1.2 hours after spamming activities occur. In 50% of cases, Greystar is at least one day ahead of victim spam reports.

The high accuracy and fast response time of Greystar allow us to restrict more spam numbers soon after spamming activities emerge, thereby reducing a majority of the spam messages in the network. Simulations on real network data show that deploying Greystar can reduce 75% of spam messages during peak hours, greatly benefiting cellular carriers by alleviating the load on network resources and limiting the adverse impact on legitimate mobile users.

## 2. Background and Datasets
### 2.1 SMS Architecture in UMTS
The cellular network under study primarily uses UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System), a popular 3G mobile communication technology. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture for delivering SMS messages in UMTS networks. When sending an SMS, an end user equipment (UEA) communicates with a cell tower (or node-B), which forwards the message to a Radio Network Controller (RNC). The RNC then delivers the message to a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) server, where it enters the SS7 network and is temporarily stored at a Short Message Service Center (SMSC). From the SMSC, the message is routed to the recipient's serving MSC, RNC, and node-B, and finally reaches the recipient (UEB). Messages from other carrier networks (e.g., UEC) also traverse the SS7 network and bypass the serving MSC before arriving at UEB.

### 2.2 Datasets
We use two datasets for our study:
1. **SMS Call Detail Records (CDRs):** These records, collected at the serving MSCs of SMS recipients, represent SMS messages targeting registered mobile customers of the UMTS network. The CDR dataset spans five months from January 2012 to May 2012 and includes the SMS receiving time, originating number, terminating number, and IMEI for the device associated with the terminating number. Note that CDR records do not contain the text content of the original SMS messages.
2. **Victim Spam Reports:** These contain spam messages reported by recipients to the carrier. The carrier deploys an SMS spam reporting service, allowing users to forward spam messages to a designated number. Once the process is completed, a spam report is created, including the reporter's phone number, the spam number, the reporting time, and the text content of the reported spam message. We used six months of spam reports from January 2012 to June 2012 to cover spam numbers observed between January and May but reported after May due to delays.

We emphasize that no customer personal information was collected or used for our study. All customer identifiers were anonymized, and only the area code and hashed remaining digits of phone numbers were used. Similarly, only the first 8-digit Type Allocation Code (TAC) of the IMEI was retained to identify device types while preserving customer privacy.

### 2.3 Obtaining Ground Truth
Although victim spam reports provide some ground truth, they are not comprehensive and can be noisy. Therefore, we employed fraud agents from the UMTS carrier to manually verify spam number candidates. These agents use richer sources of information, such as ownership and price plan details, SMS sending patterns, and correlation with known spam numbers. The final decision is made conservatively by corroborating different evidence. Fraud agents have been deployed independently for SMS spam number detection and restriction for over a year, and no false alarms have been observed. Thus, we treat fraud agents as a black box authority, submitting a list of spam number candidates and receiving a list of confirmed spam numbers.

## 3. Objectives and Existing Solutions
### 3.1 SMS Spam Defense Objectives
In a typical SMS spamming scenario, a spammer invests in a set of phone numbers and high-speed devices, such as 3G modems and SIM boxes, to send unsolicited SMS messages to a large number of mobile numbers. The goal is to entice further actions from recipients, such as calling a fraudulent number or clicking on a URL link to a malicious site. However, SMS spamming has unique characteristics that make traditional email spam defenses inapplicable or inefficient.

Email service providers typically detect and filter spam at their mail servers, exploiting rich features in emails, including text content. While blacklist-based approaches are sometimes used, restricting email spammers is not the main focus due to the need for collaboration between email providers and network carriers. Moreover, many spam emails originate from legitimate hosts due to botnet activities, making restricting spam originators impractical.

In contrast, SMS messages are delivered instantly through the SS7 network, leaving little time for cellular carriers to react. Filtering SMS spam at end-user devices is also not feasible, as many SMS-capable devices do not support such apps. Additionally, even when SMS spam filters are deployed, spammers can still cause significant loss to the carrier and other users by increasing SMS traffic volume, leading to congestion and deteriorating network performance. Therefore, the primary objective of SMS spam defense is to control spam numbers as quickly as possible before they reach a large number of victims.

### 3.2 Spam Detection by Crowdsourcing Victim Spam Reports
The emphasis on high accuracy has led to the widespread adoption of spam detection methods based on victim spam reports. These reports represent a reliable and clean source of SMS spam samples, as all messages have been vetted and classified by mobile users. To further mitigate errors, cellular carriers crowdsource spam reports from different users. For example, a simple yet effective method is to aggregate reports and cross-verify them. However, these methods suffer from significant delays due to low report rates and slow user responses, making them inefficient in controlling SMS spam.

## 4. Motivation for Greystar
To address the limitations of existing solutions, we propose Greystar, a system that leverages the grey phone space to detect SMS spam numbers. Grey phone numbers, associated with data-only and M2M devices, form a grey territory that legitimate users rarely enter. By monitoring interactions with these grey numbers, Greystar can quickly and accurately detect spam numbers, providing a more efficient and responsive solution to the growing problem of SMS spam.

## 5. Definition of Grey Numbers
Grey numbers are phone numbers associated with two types of mobile devices: data-only devices (e.g., laptop data cards and data modems) and M2M communication devices (e.g., utility meters and medical devices). These devices typically do not participate actively in SMS communication, making them ideal for monitoring spam activity. The wide dispersion of grey numbers makes them difficult for spammers to evade, as they cannot predict which numbers are grey.

## 6. Design of Greystar
Greystar employs a novel statistical model to detect spam numbers based on their interactions with grey numbers and other non-grey phone numbers. The system continuously monitors SMS traffic and uses the following steps to identify spam numbers:

1. **Data Collection:** Collect SMS call detail records and victim spam reports.
2. **Preprocessing:** Anonymize and preprocess the data to extract relevant features.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Extract features such as the frequency of interactions with grey numbers, the distribution of target numbers, and the timing of SMS messages.
4. **Statistical Modeling:** Use a statistical model to analyze the extracted features and identify patterns indicative of spam activity.
5. **Detection and Verification:** Detect potential spam numbers and submit them to fraud agents for verification.

## 7. Evaluation Results
Our evaluation using five months of SMS call records shows that Greystar is highly effective in detecting spam numbers. Specifically, Greystar detected over 34,000 spam numbers with only two false positives. Additionally, more than 15% of the detected spam numbers had never been reported by mobile users. Greystar's median detection time is 1.2 hours after spamming activities occur, and in 50% of cases, it is at least one day ahead of victim spam reports.

Simulations on real network data demonstrate that deploying Greystar can reduce 75% of spam messages during peak hours, significantly benefiting cellular carriers by alleviating the load on network resources and limiting the adverse impact on legitimate mobile users.

## 8. Related Work
Existing solutions for SMS spam detection primarily rely on victim spam reports, which, although accurate, suffer from significant delays. Other approaches, such as filtering based on sending patterns, often result in high false alarm rates. Greystar addresses these limitations by leveraging the grey phone space and employing a novel statistical model, providing a more efficient and responsive solution.

## 9. Conclusion
In this paper, we presented Greystar, an innovative system for detecting SMS spam numbers in large cellular networks. By monitoring interactions with grey phone numbers and using a novel statistical model, Greystar can quickly and accurately detect spam numbers, reducing the impact of SMS spam on network performance and user experience. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of Greystar, making it a valuable tool for cellular carriers in combating SMS spam.
