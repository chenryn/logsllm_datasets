  * Electron version: 0.30+
  * Operating system: Windows, Mac & Linux
There are plenty of small & large desktop applications made in Electron, and
while core application logic may be under a few megabytes, the installer
(having its own Electron bundled) itself adds over 60 MB of weight. Once I
have couple of Electron based apps installed, I have multiple Electron
binaries installed dedicated for each single app.
Now, I'm aware that each such app **may be using a different version of
Electron itself (relying on features & bugs of a particular version to get the
job done)**, but that's the point here, to make sure that run-time serves the
platform and apps carry just its own dependencies (NPM modules unrelated of
Electron), thus making resulting installers way less in size. Look at JVM or
Adobe AIR, for example.
Obviously there can be special scenarios where Electron is patched for a
particular app (Brave browser for instance, has process sandboxing enabled, a
feature not natively supported in Electron itself), in such case installer can
carry runtime along, but trivial applications don't need it.
Abricotine is one such example, where it is plain Markdown editor (and source
is measly **2 MB** ), but 64bit Windows installer is **75 MB!**.
This problem of redundant installations is only going to add bloat as adoption
of technologies like Electron & NW.js increases to create Desktop applications
(being dead simple to get apps running instead of going a native route).
Thanks.
