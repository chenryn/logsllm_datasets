User: Does anyone use a scripting language only solution to produce a binary (.exe) to produce a commercial desktop application for windows or mac? e.g. Java, python etc. If so how do you distribute your app and does using a scripting language cause any problems with the installation?
I'm asking about users that can download an application and install it, they don't know about setting path variables, or changing there JAVA_HOME. The assumption for the PC are users with a consumer PC with windows (XP/Vista/7), not power users. (Or alternatively a mac type solution would be interesting to hear about to)
Assistant: Does anyone use anything else for shrink wrap apps on windows? e.g. Java, python etc.

Yes. I assume you're not really asking about Java, since that is so wide-spread. I can count quite a few Java applications that I use, and I don't operate in the "Enterprise" environment.
There are tools that allow you to ship Python code without shipping actual .py files and without needing the to actually have Python installed, so there are solutions for that as well. Since such tools exist I assume people do ship Python applications.

If so how do you distribute your app and does using a scripting language cause any problems with the installation?

What scripting language?
