According to Hibernate Validator documentation, the JPA 2 provider (like
Hibernate 3.5) will detect presence of validator implementation on classpath,
and automatically validate `@Entities` during persist or merge calls. However,
it doesn't work for me in Spring app - the validation is not called, I must
call it explicitly (I don't use `@Valid-marked` controller inputs, becuase it
doesn't fit well our needs. We call Spring DataBinder explicitly, and we have
to call it's validate() method to trigger Hibernate Validator to run). Why
validation is not triggered by Hibernate automatically? Is it something
specific to Spring environment, perhaps it is disabled intentionally (e.g. to
not duplicate validation after validating controller inputs)? Or it's
Hibernate bug? (I tested it with Hibernate 3.5.0)
