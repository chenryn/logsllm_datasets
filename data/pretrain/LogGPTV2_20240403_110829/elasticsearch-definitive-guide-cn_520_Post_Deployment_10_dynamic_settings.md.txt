### Dynamically Changing Settings in Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch allows for the dynamic modification of many settings through its API. To avoid the need for node or cluster restarts, it is recommended to use the API rather than making changes through static configuration files.

#### Cluster Update API

The `cluster-update` API operates in two modes: **Transient** and **Persistent**.

- **Transient Settings**: These changes are effective until the cluster restarts. After a full cluster restart, these settings are erased.
- **Persistent Settings**: These changes are permanently in place unless explicitly modified. They will survive full cluster restarts and override the static configuration files.

To apply both transient and persistent settings, you can use the following JSON body in a PUT request:

```json
PUT /_cluster/settings
{
    "persistent": {
        "discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes": 2
    },
    "transient": {
        "indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec": "50mb"
    }
}
```

- The **persistent** setting `discovery.zen.minimum_master_nodes` will remain in effect even after a full cluster restart.
- The **transient** setting `indices.store.throttle.max_bytes_per_sec` will be removed after the first full cluster restart.

For a comprehensive list of settings that can be updated dynamically, refer to the official Elasticsearch documentation: [Cluster Update Settings](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/cluster-update-settings.html).
