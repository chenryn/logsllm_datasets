# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Often times, I just want to quickly view images in a full size (or zoom in) in
my currently opened folder in the file explorer. To do that, you have to open
it in Photos or any other external app which takes some time to start up and
you will only see one image at a time.
Having a simple gallery "integrated" into file explorer - activated by a
shortcut or some button in a ribbon would make browsing through images
smoother and faster.
I have implemented such a functionality in my project. More details and demos

# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I am happy to integrate my project into PowerToys -
