**Introduction: Cyber Security and National Security**

**I. Introduction**

1. **Cyber Security and National Security**

Cyber security has rapidly evolved from a technical discipline to a strategic concept. Globalization and the Internet have provided individuals, organizations, and nations with unprecedented power, driven by continuously advancing networking technology. For everyone—students, soldiers, spies, propagandists, hackers, and terrorists—information gathering, communication, fundraising, and public relations have been digitized and revolutionized.

As a result, all political and military conflicts now have a cyber dimension, the size and impact of which are challenging to predict. Battles fought in cyberspace can be more significant than those on the ground. Similar to terrorism, hackers have found success through media hype. Like weapons of mass destruction (WMD), it is difficult to retaliate against asymmetric attacks.

The remarkable achievements of cyber espionage highlight the high return on investment in computer hacking. The initial cost is low, and traditional espionage methods, such as human intelligence, are more dangerous. Computer hacking provides free research and development data and access to sensitive communications. National leaders, who frequently address cyber espionage on the global stage, are concerned.

The use and abuse of computers, databases, and networks to achieve military objectives was known in the early 1980s in the Soviet Union as the Military Technological Revolution (MTR). After the 1991 Gulf War, the Pentagon’s Revolution in Military Affairs became almost a household term. A cyber attack is not an end in itself but a powerful means to various ends, from propaganda to espionage, from denial of service to the destruction of critical infrastructure. The nature of a national security threat has not changed, but the Internet has provided a new delivery mechanism that can increase the speed, scale, and power of an attack.

Dozens of real-world examples, from the U.S. to Russia, from the Middle East to the Far East, demonstrate that the ubiquity and vulnerability of the Internet have tangible political and military ramifications. As the Internet becomes more powerful and our dependence on it grows, cyber attacks may evolve from a corollary of real-world disputes to play a lead role in future conflicts.

In 1948, Hans Morgenthau wrote that national security depends on the integrity of a nation’s borders and its institutions. In 2011, military invasion and terrorist attack remain the most certain ways to threaten the security of an adversary. However, as national critical infrastructures, including everything from elections to electricity, are computerized and connected to the Internet, national security planners must also worry about cyber attacks.

Large, complex infrastructures are easier to manage with computers and common operating systems, applications, and network protocols. However, this convenience comes at a price. Connectivity is currently well ahead of security, making the Internet and its users vulnerable to attack. There are not only more devices connected to the Internet every day, but there are dozens of additions to the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database each month. These combine to create what hackers call the expanding "attack surface." Hackers, often creative, exploit this complexity to read, delete, and/or modify information without proper authorization.

One paradox of the cyber battlefield is that both large and small players have advantages. Nations robust in IT exploit superior computing power and bandwidth; small countries and even lone hackers exploit the amplifying power of the Internet to attack a stronger conventional foe. Furthermore, Internet-dependent nations are tempting targets because they have more to lose when the network goes down.

In cyber conflict, the terrestrial distance between adversaries can be irrelevant because everyone is a next-door neighbor in cyberspace. Hardware, software, and bandwidth form the landscape, not mountains, valleys, or waterways. The most powerful weapons are based on logic and innovation, not strength.

It is also true that cyber attacks are constrained by the limited terrain of cyberspace. Many skeptics of cyber warfare argue that tactical victories amount to a successful reshuffling of bits inside a computer. Then, the attacker must wait to see if anything happens in the real world. There is no guarantee of success. Network reconfiguration, software updates, and human decision-making change the cyber terrain without warning, and even a well-planned attack can fail.

In fact, the dynamic nature of the Internet offers benefits to both attackers and defenders. Many cyber battles will be won by the side that uses cutting-edge technologies to greater advantage. Although an attacker has more targets and ways to hit them, a defender can design an ever-increasing level of network redundancy and survivability.

In 2011, an attacker's most important advantage remains a degree of anonymity. Smart hackers hide within the international, maze-like architecture of the Internet, routing attacks through countries with which a victim’s government has poor diplomatic relations or no law enforcement cooperation. In theory, even a major cyber conflict could be fought against an unknown adversary.

Law enforcement and counterintelligence investigations suffer because the Internet is an international entity, and jurisdiction ends every time a telecommunications cable crosses a border. In the case of a state-sponsored cyber attack, international cooperation is naturally non-existent.

The anonymity or "attribution" problem is serious enough to increase the likelihood of damaging cyber attacks on national critical infrastructures during times of nominal peace, with no traditional, real-world warning.

Cyber defense suffers because traditional security skills are of marginal help in defending computer networks, and it is difficult to retain personnel with marketable technical expertise. Talented computer scientists prefer more exciting, higher-paying positions elsewhere.

As a consequence, at the technical level, it can be challenging to determine whether one is under cyber attack. At the political level, the intangible nature of cyberspace makes the calculation of victory, defeat, and battle damage highly subjective. With cyber law, there is still not enough expertise to keep pace with the threat.

Finally, cyber defense suffers because there is little moral inhibition to computer hacking, which primarily involves the use and abuse of computer code. So far, there is little perceived human suffering.

All things considered, the current balance of cyber power favors the attacker. This stands in contrast to our historical understanding of warfare, in which the defender has traditionally enjoyed a home field advantage.

Therefore, many governments may conclude that, for the foreseeable future, the best cyber defense is a good offense. First, cyber attacks may be required to defend the homeland; second, they are a powerful and sometimes deniable way to project national power.

Can a cyber attack pose a serious threat to national security? Decision-makers are still unsure. Case studies are few, much information lies outside the public domain, and there have been no wars between two first-class militaries in the Internet era. Most organizations are still unsure about their own cyber security.

Conducting an "information operation" of strategic significance is not easy, but neither is it impossible. During World War II, the Allies took advantage of having broken the Enigma cipher to feed false information to Adolf Hitler, signaling that the D-Day invasion would take place at Pas-de-Calais and not Normandy. This gave Allied forces critical time to establish a foothold on the continent and change the course of history.

What military officers call the "battlespace" grows more difficult to define—and to defend—over time. Advances in technology are normally evolutionary but can be revolutionary. Artillery reached over the front lines of battle; rockets and airplanes crossed national boundaries; today, cyber attacks can target political leadership, military systems, and average citizens anywhere in the world, during peacetime or war, with the added benefit of attacker anonymity.

Narrowly defined, the Internet is just a collection of networked computers. But the importance of "cyberspace" as a concept grows every day. The perceived threat is such that the new U.S. Cyber Command has declared cyberspace to be a new domain of warfare, and the top three priorities at the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are preventing terrorism, espionage, and cyber attacks.

Cyber warfare is unlike traditional warfare, but it shares some characteristics with the historical roles of aerial bombardment, submarine warfare, special operations forces, and even assassins. Specifically, it can inflict painful, asymmetric damage on an adversary from a distance or by exploiting the element of surprise.

The post-World War II U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) may hold some lessons for cyber war planners. The USSBS concluded that air power did not permanently destroy any indispensable adversary industry during the war and that "persistent re-attack" was always necessary. Nonetheless, the report left no doubt about its ultimate conclusion.
