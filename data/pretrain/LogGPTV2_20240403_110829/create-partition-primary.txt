create partition primary
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Creates a primary partition on the basic disk with focus. After the partition has been created, the focus automatically shifts to the new partition.
Important
A basic disk must be selected for this operation to succeed. You must use the select disk command to select a basic disk and shift the focus to it.
Syntax
create partition primary [size=] [offset=] [id={  |  }] [align=] [noerr]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
size=
Specifies the size of the partition in megabytes (MB). If no size is given, the partition continues until there is no more unallocated space in the current region.
offset=
The offset in kilobytes (KB), at which the partition is created. If no offset is given, the partition will start at the beginning of the largest disk extent that is large enough to hold it.
align=
Aligns all partition extents to the closest alignment boundary. Typically used with hardware RAID Logical Unit Number (LUN) arrays to improve performance.  is the number of kilobytes (KB) from the beginning of the disk to the closest alignment boundary.
id={   |  }
Specifies the partition type. This parameter is intended for original equipment manufacturer (OEM) use only. Any partition type byte or GUID can be specified with this parameter. DiskPart doesn't check the partition type for validity except to ensure that it is a byte in hexadecimal form or a GUID. Caution: Creating partitions with this parameter might cause your computer to fail or be unable to start up. Unless you are an OEM or an IT professional experienced with gpt disks, do not create partitions on gpt disks using this parameter. Instead, always use the create partition efi command to create EFI System partitions, the create partition msr command to create Microsoft Reserved partitions, and the create partition primary) command (without the id={   |  parameter) to create primary partitions on gpt disks.For master boot record (MBR) disks, you must specify a partition type byte, in hexadecimal form, for the partition. If this parameter isn't specified, the command creates a partition of type 0x06, which specifies that a file system isn't installed. Examples include:LDM data partition: 0x42Recovery partition: 0x27Recognized OEM partition: 0x12, 0x84, 0xDE, 0xFE, 0xA0For GUID partition table (gpt) disks, you can specify a partition type GUID for the partition that you want to create. Recognized GUIDs include:EFI system partition: c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93bMicrosoft Reserved partition: e3c9e316-0b5c-4db8-817d-f92df00215aeBasic data partition: ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7LDM metadata partition (dynamic disk): 5808c8aa-7e8f-42e0-85d2-e1e90434cfb3LDM data partition  (dynamic disk): af9b60a0-1431-4f62-bc68-3311714a69adRecovery partition: de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6acIf this parameter isn't specified for a gpt disk, the command creates a basic data partition.
noerr
For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without the noerr parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.

id={   | 
For master boot record (MBR) disks, you must specify a partition type byte, in hexadecimal form, for the partition. If this parameter isn't specified, the command creates a partition of type 0x06, which specifies that a file system isn't installed. Examples include:LDM data partition: 0x42Recovery partition: 0x27Recognized OEM partition: 0x12, 0x84, 0xDE, 0xFE, 0xA0For GUID partition table (gpt) disks, you can specify a partition type GUID for the partition that you want to create.

0x06
For GUID partition table (gpt) disks, you can specify a partition type GUID for the partition that you want to create. Recognized GUIDs include:EFI system partition: c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93bMicrosoft Reserved partition: e3c9e316-0b5c-4db8-817d-f92df00215aeBasic data partition: ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7LDM metadata partition (dynamic disk): 5808c8aa-7e8f-42e0-85d2-e1e90434cfb3LDM data partition  (dynamic disk): af9b60a0-1431-4f62-bc68-3311714a69adRecovery partition: de94bba4-06d1-4d40-a16a-bfd50179d6acIf this parameter isn't specified for a gpt disk, the command creates a basic data partition.
If this parameter isn't specified for a gpt disk, the command creates a basic data partition.
Examples
To create a primary partition of 1000 megabytes in size, type:
create partition primary size=1000
