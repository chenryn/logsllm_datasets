I have recently installed Kivy in Python 2.7.11 on my Windows 7 PC using the command prompt. After the installation, I copied some Kivy programs from my Android tablet to run them on my PC. However, whenever I try to open IDLE, it gives a "subprocess startup error" and eventually stops responding. 

Interestingly, when I run Python's built-in modules, there are no errors. I have already tried reinstalling Python, but the issue persists.

**Assistant:**

The "subprocess startup error" you are encountering might be caused by a newly created Python file that has the same name as an existing library or module. For example, if you have a file named `re.py` or `os.py`, this could conflict with the predefined libraries `re` and `os`.

To resolve this issue, please check your project directory for any files that might have the same name as Python's standard libraries and rename them. This should help in resolving the subprocess startup error.
