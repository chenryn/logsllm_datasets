User: I have just installed kivy in python 2.7.11. After installing it, whenever i try to open IDLE, it is giving subprocess startup error.
Actually i installed kivy on my windows 7 PC through command prompt. After installation, I copied programs of kivy from my android tab to run them on my pc. When I tried to open them, IDLE doesn't respond for some time and after some time it gives startup error. Since then IDLE is not starting .
But it is quite strange that, on running python builtin module, there is no error.
I had reinstalled python but still there is no change.
Assistant: reason for subprocess startup error can be a new python file that you have created recently with the same name as same existing libraries or module name

e.g. 're.py','os.py' etc

beacuse re,os are the predefined libraries
just go and find the file and rename it
hope so it will be resolved
