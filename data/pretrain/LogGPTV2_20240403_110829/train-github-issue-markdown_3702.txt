##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.1.1
  * Operating System / Platform => Android/ Lenovo Z5
  * Compiler => Cmake
##### Detailed description
I have a caffe model of mtcnn and a caffe model of sphereface. I have built a
pipeline that takes an image and produces an embedding of the face. Pipeline
is written in c++. On my CPU i5 processor opencv dnn is loading the models and
is taking 100 milliseconds for processing. Exactly same code when i deploy on
android takes around 20 times more time for execution. I have tried compiling
opencv on android using MKL and openblas but i found no different at all in
processing speed. Here is my cmake configuration:
"-DBUILD_opencv_world=ON -DBUILD_opencv_gapi=OFF -DWITH_NVCUVID=OFF " +  
"-DWITH_CUBLAS=ON -DWITH_MKL=ON -DMKL_USE_MULTITHREAD=ON -DMKL_WITH_TBB=ON
-DWITH_TBB=ON " +  
"-DINSTALL_TESTS=ON -DINSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
-DWITH_OPENGL=ON" +  
"-DOPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON -DWITH_NVCUVID=ON -DWITH_MFX=ON"
##### Steps to reproduce
Simply take any caffe model and run it on CPU and then use the same code
android. Android processing will be a lot slower. I am expecting this to be
slow on android but it is absurdly slower in my case. I can expect 4 to 5
times slower performance but 20 times is just not acceptable.
