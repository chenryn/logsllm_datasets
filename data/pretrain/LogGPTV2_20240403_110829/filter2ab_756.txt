### Title: BotConf 2015 - Powered by JavaScript

JavaScript's current capabilities have transformed the web browser into an ideal host for botnet agents. This transformation is due to several key factors:

- **Multiple Attack Vectors:** Browsers can be compromised through various attack vectors.
- **Rich Functionality:** JavaScript provides a wide range of functionalities, enabling complex operations.
- **Persistence and Storage:** JavaScript can maintain persistence and utilize local storage mechanisms.
- **Communication Channels:** It can freely communicate with multiple Command and Control (C&C) channels.
- **Pivoting Point:** The browser serves as a perfect pivot point for further propagation into internal networks or other targets.

Given these capabilities, JavaScript should be considered a powerful enabler for botnets, deeply integrated with other technologies such as HTML5, WebRTC, and even local shell commands. It can interfere at any stage of the botnet lifecycle, from initial injection to ongoing operations.

This presentation aims to identify recent JavaScript-based techniques that have proven effective in implementing core botnet capabilities, including:

- **Injection:** Techniques for injecting malicious code into the browser.
- **Control:** Methods for maintaining control over the compromised browser.
- **Persistence:** Strategies for ensuring the botnet remains active.
- **Propagation:** Mechanisms for spreading the botnet to other systems.
- **Operations:** Activities that can be performed from the compromised browser.

Additionally, the presentation will demonstrate how one could build a 100% JavaScript-based botnet capable of evading most of the current defenses in modern IT environments.
