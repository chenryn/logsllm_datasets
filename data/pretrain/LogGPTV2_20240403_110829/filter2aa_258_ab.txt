### Simplified Deployment and User Trust
- **Ease of Deployment**: This solution is easier to deploy, and users do not need new software because they already fully trust the proxy.

### Independent Personal Proxies
- **Examples**: Circumventor, CGIProxy, Psiphon
- **Relay Strategy**: Similar to other relays, but with a new discovery method: "Find a friend to install the relay for you."
- **Challenges**:
  - **Blocking Resistance**: Effective against blocking, but scalability is a concern.
  - **Discovery Issues**:
    - How does a user in China find a volunteer in Ohio?
    - How does a volunteer in Ohio find a user in China?

### Open Proxies
- **Availability**: Search for "open proxy list" or purchase refined lists from companies.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - **Bandwidth and Stability**: Varies widely.
  - **Legal Concerns**: Legally questionable.
  - **Security**: Not encrypted in most cases, making keyword filtering still effective.
  - **Trust**: Convenience may raise suspicions about whether they are run by adversaries.

### JAP and Blocking-Resistance
- **Source**: Stefan Kopsell's paper from WPES 2004.
- **Concept**: This is the foundational idea for our blocking-resistance design.
- **Network**: Uses the JAP anonymity network instead of Tor.
- **Discovery**: Users solve a CAPTCHA to learn a relay address.

### Internal Caching Networks
- **Example**: Running a Freenet network within China or other countries.
- **Benefits**: Many users can access content without crossing the national firewall.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Usability**: Potential issues with ease of use.
  - **Anonymity**: Anonymity concerns.

### Skype
- **Features**: Port switching and encryption help avoid simple blocking and filtering attacks.
- **Centralization**: Still relies on a central login server.

### Tor and Its Accessibility
- **Website Blocking**: Tor's website is often blocked, but the Tor network itself is not.
- **User Base**: Tens of thousands of users; the perception is that it is primarily for experts.
- **Threat Perception**: Tor is seen as non-threatening to control, being more associated with civil liberties in free countries.
- **Arms Race**: We are already in an ongoing arms race, which informs us about the priorities and capabilities of our attackers.

### Outline
- **Goals**
- **Assumptions (Threat Model)**
- **Current Capabilities of Tor**
- **Existing Proxy Solutions**
- **Enhancements Needed for Tor**
- **Other Relevant Issues**

### Bridge Relays
- **User Base**: Hundreds of thousands of Tor users who value privacy.
- **Implementation**: Add a "Tor for Freedom" button to Vidalia, the most popular Tor GUI.
- **Rate Limiting**: Set to 10KB/s.
- **Role**: Can be internal relays and do not have to be exit relays.

### Bridge Directory Authorities
- **Function**: Specialized authorities that track bridges but do not provide a public list.
- **Key and Address**: Default bridge authorities' identity key and address are included with Tor.
- **Security**: Bridges publish via Tor to avoid network monitoring.

### One Working Bridge is Sufficient
- **Connection**: Connect through a working bridge to the bridge authority and the main Tor network.
- **Simplification**: Reduces the problem to learning about a working bridge.

### Hiding Tor's Network Fingerprint
- **Improvements**:
  - Eliminate plaintext HTTP.
  - Use a common port like 443.
  - Mimic ordinary HTTPS certificate exchanges.
  - Better understand timing and volume fingerprint attacks.

### Discovering Working Bridge Relays
- **Modular Design**: Allows separation of relay and discovery components.
- **Flexibility**: Any discovery approach can be used, but no perfect solutions exist yet.

### Discovery: Bootstrapping
- **Assumption**: Users have a way to bypass the firewall initially.
- **Methods**: Open proxies, instant messaging, Skype, WoW, or knowing a friend.

### Independent Bridges, No Central Discovery
- **Similar to**: CGIProxy.
- **Bootstrap Methods**:
  - Knowing the bridge operator.
  - Learning from a local friend.
- **Incentives**:
  - If a bridge is blocked, both the user and their friend lose access.
  - Mapping social networks for adversaries.

### Families of Bridges, No Central Discovery
- **Volunteers**: Run multiple bridges or coordinate with others.
- **Goal**: Ensure some bridges are always available.
- **Management**: Each family has a bridge authority to manage the pool.

### Public Bridges, Central Discovery
- **Challenge**: Bridges and users who do not know each other.
- **Solution**: Divide bridges into pools based on identity keys and distribution strategies.

### Distribution Strategies
- **Strategy #1**: Time-release bridge addresses.
- **Strategy #2**: Publish based on requester's IP address.
- **Strategy #3**: Combine time-based and location-based strategies.
- **Strategy #4**: Use Circumventor's mailing list trick.
- **Strategy #5**: Email-based bridge distribution.
- **Strategy #6**: Social network reputation system.
- **Strategies #7 and #8**: Reserved for future deployment.

### Deploying All Solutions
- **Approach**: Deploy all strategies simultaneously to increase the likelihood of success.
- **Defensive Position**: Only one scheme needs to work, while the attacker must allocate resources across all strategies.

### Detecting Blocked Bridges
- **Active Testing**: Use Blossom-like systems to test circuits.
- **Passive Testing**: Bridges report traffic and country data.
- **Challenges**: Different Internet zones, potential faults, and database poisoning.

### Using Tor in Oppressed Areas
- **Common Assumption**: Risk increases with stricter firewalls.
- **Reality**: As firewalls become stricter, more mainstream users adopt Tor, making its use more acceptable.

### Trusting Local Hardware/Software
- **Options**: Internet cafes, USB-based Tor packages, CD-based Tor packages (LiveCD).

### Number of Bridges Needed
- **Churn**: Cablemodem/DSL bridges can disappear or move.
- **Frequency**: How often should users fetch updates?

### Cablemodems and Economic Pressure
- **Risk**: Attackers can block connections to major ISPs.
- **Diversity**: Need bridges on both consumer and producer addresses.
- **Economic Threats**: E.g., pressure from China on Verizon.

### Publicity and Attention
- **Launch**: Media attention can attract censors.
- **Control**: We can manage the pace of the arms race.

### Next Steps
- **Technical Solutions**: Critical but not sufficient alone.
- **Actions**: Deploy prototype bridges, implement discovery strategies, and gather more insights.

### Ensuring Tor's Survival
- **Global Discussion**: Anonymity's value and threats to privacy.
- **Support Needed**: More Tor servers, volunteers, and funding.
