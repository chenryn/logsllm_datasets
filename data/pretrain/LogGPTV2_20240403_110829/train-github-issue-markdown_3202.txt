 **Describe the bug**  
I use axios.get method with custom httpsAgent and httpAgent in node.js. The
node_internals _http_client.js emit a warn when the server response http
statue code 302 and headers location's protocol is different with the
initiator url's protocol.
**To Reproduce**  
Code snippet to reproduce, ideally that will work by pasting into something
like https://npm.runkit.com/axios, a hosted solution, or a repository that
illustrates the issue. **If your problem is not reproducible, please file
under Support or Usage Question**
    // Example code here
    const axios = require("axios");
    const https = require("https");
    const http = require("http");
    const httpsAgent = new https.Agent({keepAlive: true})
    const httpAgent = new http.Agent({keepAlive: true})
    const url = 'https://xxxxx';
    axios
      .get(url, {
        httpsAgent,
        httpAgent
      })
      .then(() => {
        console.log("success");
      })
      .catch(() => {
        console.error("error:");
      });
I had read the axios' code , the httpFollow and httpsFollow's options should
includes customer's agent
**Expected behavior**  
axios use a new agent adapter the redirect url protocol
**Environment:**
  * Axios Version: 0.19.0
  * Node Version: v12.14.0
