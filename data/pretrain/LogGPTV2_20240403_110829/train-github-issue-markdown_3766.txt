Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

To enhance the `FormData` constructor to accept an `HTMLFormElement` as a parameter, you can refer to the documentation at [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData).

The updated TypeScript declaration for `FormData` should include the following:

```typescript
declare var FormData: {
  prototype: FormData;
  new (): FormData;
  new (form: HTMLFormElement): FormData;
};
```

This declaration is based on a fix from [TypeScript CodePlex Issue #720](https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/720), which has not yet been incorporated into TypeScript version 1.4.

Additionally, you can make the `form` parameter optional by using the following declaration:

```typescript
new (form?: HTMLFormElement): FormData;
```

Thank you in advance!
