Additional constructor that takes in HTMLFormElement as parameter as here:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/XMLHttpRequest/FormData
declare var FormData: {  
prototype: FormData;  
new (): FormData;  
new (form: HTMLFormElement): FormData;  
};
This is copied from https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/720, the fix
isn't incorporated into TS v 1.4.  
It's possible to write the constructor in the optional form as well:  
new (form?: HTMLFormElement): FormData;
Thanks in advance!
