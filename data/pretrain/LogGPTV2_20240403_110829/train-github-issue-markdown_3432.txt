  * bug report
**Webpack version:**  
2.1.0-beta.13
**Please tell us about your environment:**  
OSX 10.11.5
**Current behavior:**  
When loaders are defined with `-loader` (e.g. `babel-loader`), because the
default value of `moduleExtensions` is `-loader`, module resolution attempts
to find `babel-loader-loader`, which causes an erroneous `npm install` with
this plugin:
> https://github.com/ericclemmons/npm-install-webpack-plugin
**Expected/desired behavior:**
Expected that that this _enforces_ the `-loader` extension, so that `babel`
becomes `babel-loader`. It should noop if `/-loader$/` matches.
  * **If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem along with a gist/jsbin of your webpack configuration.**
I believe this is due to these two files:
