from sites such as YouTube [31] and Daum [20] exhibit a
similar structure. Power-law popularity and usage distribu-
tion have also been observed in a wide-array of cases from
web-references to real-world social networks [12].
The most straightforward explanation for the existence of
the power-law is that the preferential attachment process
(generally seen on social networks) generates power-law dis-
tributions.
In our context, preferential attachment would
imply that the probability of a new user subscribing to an
application is proportional to the number of the applica-
tion’s existing users. We would expect to observe such phe-
nomenon since Facebook maintains a bulletin board (‘news
feed’) that updates Facebook users about their friends’ ac-
tivities. This serves as an advertising mechanism to promote
applications that have an existing subscription base. More-
over, users can also explicitly advertise or engage their social
network friends in applications they use.
The exponential cutoﬀ to the classical power-law distri-
bution has been studied before [12]. We consider a few
plausible explanations. [1, 4] showed how preferential attach-
ment with aging and/or fertility results in power-law with
exponential cutoﬀ. Fertility implies that applications have
a minimum number of initial subscribers before preferen-
tial attachment gets triggered. This may apply to Facebook
applications since the utility of these applications depends
upon social networking. Hence, there can exist applications
that require a certain quorum to be reached before sub-
scribers could realize its full potential. Aging implies that
after a certain time applications become obsolete. Another
explanation given in [11] is information ﬁltering. [2] also con-
sidered this to be a plausible explanation for video popular-
ity on YouTube and Daum. The argument put forth is that
given ﬁnite space, for example in the YouTube homepage or
the friends’ activity bulletin board in Facebook, information
about less used applications gets ﬁltered. Hence a classical
power-law distribution is not achieved.

Furthermore, we found that applications’ maintenance of
global rank depends on how popular applications are. To
study this, we divided the top applications on Facebook into
four tiers and measured their ranking drift for each day since
Jan 29, 2008. For an application, we deﬁne Ranking Drift
on Day X as |(RankonDay0) − (RankonDayX)|, and plot
the average drift values (per day) for each tier in Fig. 5.
It can be seen that the lowest drift is observed for the top
5% applications, and this drift increases for lower quartiles.
Furthermore, we provide the variance in DAU for each quar-
tile in Table 2. Table 2 provides an intuitive argument for
the former: since DAU numbers are closely clustered for ap-
plications in the lower quartiles, small changes in DAU lead
to large changes in an application’s rank. Similarly, since
DAU numbers are farther apart for higher quartiles, even
fairly large drops in application usage tend not to aﬀect ap-
plication ranks in the short term.
4.2 Global Usage Patterns of FC, GL, and Hugged
4.2.1 Geographical Distribution of Users
Facebook launched in May 2004 as primarily an OSN for
college students across the United States. Since then, Face-
book has expanded its reach to other geographical regions
as well. By tracking the IP addresses of users accessing our
three applications, we were able to map a subset of active
users to diﬀerent countries (see Table 1). We plot the re-
sulting geographical distribution of users for FC, GL, and
Hugged in Fig. 6a,6b,6c. As seen here, most of the ap-
plications’ users reside in United States, United Kingdom,
and Canada. Note also that user contribution from other
countries varies for diﬀerent applications, with Australia and
South Africa being the dominant countries among the lower
contributors in all three applications.
Furthermore, as shown above and supported by [22], the
majority of the users on Facebook are based in the United
States, United Kingdom, and Canada, which aﬀects traﬃc
patterns observed on (all) our indigenous applications, and
on Facebook in general [6]. For example, Fig. 7 shows a clear
diurnal pattern observed in a 24-hour snapshot of traﬃc on
FC, where bandwidth consumption rises around the start
of working hours in the United States and Canada ( 9AM
CDT) and falls sharply at the end of working hours ( 5PM
CDT). We observed similar daily traﬃc on GL and Hugged.
Moreover, around special days observed in these three re-
gions, especially Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Years Eve,
and Valentine’s Day, even weekday Facebook traﬃc falls
quite sharply, even more so than observed on regular week-
ends.
4.2.2 User Interactions and Power Laws
Consider an activity graph that consists of a node for every
user on an application. An edge exists between two nodes
A and B if A and B interacted directly with each other
(i.e., performed an activity directly on each other) through
the application. We consider the degree of a user A as the
number of distinct users A interacts with directly using an
application. Fig. 8 shows log-log plots of the degree distri-
bution for each application’s activity graph. It can be seen
that user interaction on (all) our three applications follows
a power-law distribution. However, the power-law distribu-
tion in FC is clearer than for GL and Hugged due to a denser
number of degrees in the FC activity graph.

This result implies that a small number of ‘power users’
on Facebook dominate user interaction on platform appli-
cations, and as a consequence, generate the bulk of traﬃc
or activities. We believe these power users are the driving
force for the success of an application and responsible for
sustaining the application’s daily usage numbers in the long
term.
4.2.3 Gauging User Response Times on Facebook
An aspect of social networks particularly important for ap-
plication development (especially social gaming) is the delay
in user response per activity initiated. Let ‘user response’
denote the time it takes for a target user to respond to an ac-
tivity initiated through an application. For example, for the
Hugged application, this would mean the time (number of
seconds) elapsed between sending of a ‘hug’ request, and its
reception by the target user. We say a target user ‘receives’
a request once they accept/conﬁrm the request. Note that
we tracked both when a user sent a particular ‘hug’ request
to a target, as well as when the target user conﬁrmed the
request in order to calculate user response delays. This data
was gathered for a total 684, 505 requests sent using Hugged
over 3 weeks. We use this data as a representative sample
of user response times for (all) our three applications, since
application-to-user communication generally occurs mainly
through the same channel(s) as employed in Hugged9.
A CDF of user response times collected from Hugged is
shown in Fig. 9. Since OSNs allow geographically remote
users to maintain friendships online, activity often takes
place between users in varied geographical locations, and
large user response delays are to be expected. We found
the average user response time was 16.52 hours, with the
longest response times taking up as much as 567 hours (ap-
proximately the length of the trace)! However, as can be
seen through Fig. 9, the probability of user response beyond
48 hours is considerably small and decreases noticeably af-
ter the 24-26 hour mark. We observe similar response time
across our three Facebook applications, which is not surpris-
ing since they employ the same methods for communications
9Facebook has introduced an in-beta AJAX-based method
for ‘live’ communication between users on an application
(LiveMessage). This is the same technology as used in the
built-in live chatting application available to all users on
Facebook. While we expect LiveMessage to alter response
times especially for social gaming applications on Facebook,
no data is currently available to gauge the diﬀerences.

through OSNs (i.e., e-mail, Facebook notiﬁcations, and invi-
tation requests). However, we expect to see drastically dif-
ferent response times for other Facebook applications that
involve real-time user interactions.
One may speculate that user response times would be dif-
ferent for requests sent to target users in the same locality
(country) versus targets in foreign localities. However, our
measured response times show this was not the case. The
CDF plot for local requests’ response times and that for for-
eign requests’ response times were nearly the same as those
shown in 9, with negligibly small diﬀerences. Furthermore,
the average response times for foreign and local requests
were comparable as well:
the average response time was
14.8 hours for 383, 397 foreign requests, and 15.1 hours for
219, 195 local requests tracked10.
5. COMMUNITY STRUCTURES
Development of popular applications for a broad user base
poses challenges due to the viral nature of information spread
on social networks. Scalability was one major challenge
we faced developing our three Facebook applications. For
example, within a month of launching FC, our application
servers encountered 50-55 requests/sec. This, coupled with
enormous storage, retrieval, and processing of data soon ren-
dered cheap server solutions inadequate. Furthermore, user
experience began to be aﬀected, e.g., FC users complained
of experiencing large delays when trying to meet game in-
stances’ deadlines11.
Like FC, social games (due to their relatively higher en-
gaging nature) often achieve high bandwidth consumption
even at low DAU numbers. Realizing the trend on Facebook
(especially) toward social gaming applications and consider-
ing the viral nature of information spread on social networks
in general, we expect scalability for social applications to be
a top concern for developers today. We believe that mea-
surement results presented in this section provide crucial
insights into addressing the scalability issues in developing
social applications for a massive user base.
An important consideration in alleviating scalability con-
cerns is the segregation of data into diﬀerent locations for
faster processing. Towards this end, we analyze interaction
activities on our applications, as described next.
5.1 Deﬁnitions
In order to derive the results presented next, we analyzed
the interaction graphs for FC, GL, and Hugged. We say
that two (unique) users A and B interact on an applica-
tion if: either A performs an activity on B or vice versa,
or they both perform an activity on a common friend C
