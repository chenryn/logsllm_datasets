### Power-Law and Exponential Distributions
Similar structures have been observed in the popularity and usage distributions of platforms like YouTube [31] and Daum [20]. The power-law distribution is a common phenomenon in various contexts, including web references and real-world social networks [12].

#### Explanation of Power-Law Distribution
The most straightforward explanation for the power-law distribution is the preferential attachment process, which is often seen in social networks. In this context, the probability of a new user subscribing to an application is proportional to the number of existing users. Facebook's news feed, which updates users about their friends' activities, serves as an advertising mechanism, promoting applications with a substantial subscription base. Additionally, users can explicitly advertise or engage their social network friends in the applications they use.

#### Exponential Cutoff
The exponential cutoff in the classical power-law distribution has been studied before [12]. A few plausible explanations include:
- **Preferential Attachment with Aging and Fertility:** [1, 4] showed that aging and fertility (i.e., a minimum number of initial subscribers) can result in a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff. This may apply to Facebook applications, as their utility depends on social networking, and some applications require a certain quorum to be reached before realizing their full potential.
- **Aging:** After a certain time, applications become obsolete.
- **Information Filtering:** [11] and [2] suggest that information filtering, where less used applications are filtered out due to finite space (e.g., on the YouTube homepage or Facebook's news feed), prevents the achievement of a classical power-law distribution.

### Table 2: Mean and Standard Deviation Values
| Quartile | Mean DAU | Standard Deviation |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| Top 5%   | 695,354   | 1,219,396          |
| 5%-20%   | 106,171   | 261,921            |
| 20%-50%  | 26,947    | 92,588             |
| 50%-100% | 13,003    | 34,983             |

### Application Rank Stability
We found that the maintenance of global rank depends on the popularity of the applications. We divided the top applications on Facebook into four tiers and measured their ranking drift since January 29, 2008. The ranking drift on Day X is defined as \( | \text{Rank on Day 0} - \text{Rank on Day X} | \). The average drift values for each tier are plotted in Figure 5. The lowest drift is observed for the top 5% applications, and this drift increases for lower quartiles. Table 2 provides an intuitive argument: small changes in DAU lead to large changes in rank for applications in the lower quartiles, while larger drops in usage do not significantly affect the ranks of higher-tier applications in the short term.

### 4.2 Global Usage Patterns of FC, GL, and Hugged
#### 4.2.1 Geographical Distribution of Users
Facebook, initially launched in May 2004 as a social network for college students in the United States, has expanded globally. By tracking IP addresses, we mapped active users to different countries. Figures 6a, 6b, and 6c show the geographical distribution of users for FC, GL, and Hugged. Most users reside in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. User contributions from other countries vary, with Australia and South Africa being significant contributors among the lower contributors.

#### 4.2.2 User Interactions and Power Laws
We considered an activity graph with nodes representing users and edges between nodes if users interacted directly through the application. The degree of a user is the number of distinct users they interact with. Log-log plots of the degree distribution for each application's activity graph (Figure 8) show that user interactions follow a power-law distribution, with FC having a clearer distribution due to a denser number of degrees.

#### 4.2.3 Gauging User Response Times on Facebook
User response times, defined as the time it takes for a target user to respond to an activity, were tracked for 684,505 requests sent using Hugged over three weeks. The average response time was 16.52 hours, with the longest response times up to 567 hours. The probability of user response beyond 48 hours is small and decreases after the 24-26 hour mark. Similar response times were observed across our three Facebook applications, as they use the same communication channels (e.g., email, Facebook notifications, and invitation requests).

### 5. Community Structures
Developing popular applications for a broad user base poses challenges due to the viral nature of information spread on social networks. Scalability is a major challenge, as seen with FC, which experienced 50-55 requests/second within a month of launch. Social games, due to their engaging nature, often achieve high bandwidth consumption even at low DAU numbers. Addressing scalability issues is crucial for developers today.

#### 5.1 Definitions
To analyze interaction activities, we defined two unique users A and B as interacting on an application if either A performs an activity on B or vice versa, or they both perform an activity on a common friend C.
