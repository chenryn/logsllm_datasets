User: Please provide a Git-based team collaboration process specification, including branch management, code review and release process, etc.
Assistant: 1. Branch management 1. Main branch - master branch is the branch of the stable version of the project. Only mature and tested code can be merged into the main branch. All external releases are released from the master branch. - The develop branch is a sub-branch of the main branch, which carries the latest development code and is also a branch that integrates various feature branches. 2. Feature branch - A feature branch is a branch created to develop new features or fix problems. Each feature can only correspond to one feature branch. - The feature branch is created based on the develop branch, and merged back into the develop branch after completion, and then tested by team members. - The feature branch cannot be directly merged into the master branch to avoid untested code from entering the official release version. 2. Code review 1. Process - After the developer completes the development of the feature branch, he submits a Pull Request to the develop branch. There must be a team member who conducts a code review and checks the code style and ensures that the code conforms to the conventions before the code is approved. - Code reviewers need to scrutinize code for consistency, readability, and security. The checked content includes but not limited to coding specifications, architecture design, code logic, comments and test cases. - If the code reviewer finds a problem, they can suggest changes or comment in the Pull Request. If all issues are resolved, the reviewers can approve the Pull Request and merge the code into the develop branch. - After the code review is completed, developers need to resolve code conflicts to ensure that the code can be merged smoothly and then delete the feature branch. 2. Tools - Both GitLab and GitHub provide the function of Pull Request, which is very convenient for review and conflict resolution. - Code reviewers can use code quality tools such as Code Climate or SonarQube to help meet certain code quality standards before code merges. 3. Release process 1. Process - All code changes must be submitted to the version control system and reviewed in accordance with the above process. - When a certain version is considered stable, the team can merge the version into the master branch and mark a tag to indicate that the version is released. Also make sure that the code is deployed to production or test environments. - After the release, the team needs to monitor the running status of the code to detect and solve possible problems in time. 2. Tools - Continuous integration tools such as Jenkins or GitLab CI can automate building, testing, and deploying code to speed up the release process. - Service monitoring tools such as Nagios or NewRelic can help teams detect how the code is doing and provide real-time feedback.
