**Description**  
Add a "Next Run" field to the DAG details page for scheduled DAGs.

**Use Case / Motivation**  
Understanding when a scheduled DAG will run next can be challenging, as it depends on both the `start_date` and `schedule_interval`. By including a "Next Run" field, we can provide users with a clear and immediate view of the next scheduled execution time, enhancing usability and clarity.
