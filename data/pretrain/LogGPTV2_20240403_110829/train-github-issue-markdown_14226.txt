 **Description**  
Provide a next run field in the DAG details page for scheduled dags
**Use case / motivation**  
Schedules can be trick to get at a first glance (since it related to
`start_date` and `schedule_interval`). We could help users to easily see when
the DAG will run next time
**Are you willing to submit a PR?**
Maybe 😁
