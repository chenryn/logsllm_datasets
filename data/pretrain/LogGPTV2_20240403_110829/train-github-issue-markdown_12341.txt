# Multiple FancyZones
Hi all,
I would like to have the possibility to activate a whole different layout by
holding another set of keys. Example: 1) holding Shift key while dragging a
Template previously attributed to that command would appear; 2) holding Ctrl +
Shift key while dragging another Template for that command would appear; and
so on...
I couldn't find that request anywhere. Sorry, by any means, if this is a
duplicated suggestion...
