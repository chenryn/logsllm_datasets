Not a major bug, but can be confusing.
## Steps to Reproduce
Open https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter/#4  
Scroll down until you see two code listings. The first one starts with the
comment:  
`// Modify the ChatScreen class definition to extend StatefulWidget.`  
The second one starts with the comment:  
`// Add the ChatScreenState class definition in main.dart.`
The confusing part is that, other than two comments, these code listings are
exactly the same.
