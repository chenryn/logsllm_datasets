##### SUMMARY
We recently had a change submitted to the triple-quickstart project  
that contained the following code:
    - name: Rebuild inventory
      hosts: localhost
      roles:
        - rebuild-inventory
      tags:
        - provision
    # check the target virthost distro for RHEL or CentOS
      hosts: virthost
      roles:
        - provision/support_check
      tags:
        - provision
Note that the second task list is missing the YAML list marker; it  
should look like this:
    - hosts: virthost
      roles:
        - provision/support_check
      tags:
        - provision
This is a clear error, but it passes through the YAML parser with only  
the following warning:
    [WARNING]: While constructing a mapping from /home/lars/src/tripleo-
    quickstart/playbooks/provision.yml, line 21, column 3, found a
    duplicate dict key (roles).  Using last defined value only.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
(see above playbook samples)
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Since duplicate keys are in fact not possible, I would expect Ansible  
to abort with an error at this point.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Ansible ignores the error and continues on its merry way.  
Because this warning comes from deep within the parser, it's not even  
possible for something like `ansible-lint` to catch the problem,  
either.
##### ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY
This is, oddly enough, the exact opposite of #13603.
