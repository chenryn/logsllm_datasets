titleblackhat:eu-22 Choo Choo, Network Train - The One to Rule Your Perimeter
I hear you saying: "MQTT again, that's an old and stale topic." It's actually not old or stale. MQTT is still out there and many servers are still open to attack. But even more interesting, what other devices are connected to those open servers and what networks are they sitting on? For example, do you know that with MQTT it's possible to open a whole network from the inside out using one simple wall switch? An MQTT attack against a network can also be used for DNS hijacking, DDoS attacks, and control of Bluetooth devices on internal networks among other things.We are concerned that MQTT leaks data but I'll show in this talk we really should be focusing on the bigger risk posed by using MQTT to replace the firmware in connected devices. I'll show how attackers can use this vector to jump protocols, poison data or cross perimeter boundaries among other things. How deep can this rabbit hole lead? I'll show at least some of what I've found as well as release a tool to the community that they can use to better understand the risks MQTT can pose.
