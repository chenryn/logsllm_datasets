Please consider adding a class named table-fixedheader that can be applied to
a table so that the body scrolls under fixed headers.
See this JSFiddle for a working demo: http://jsfiddle.net/drueter/yqgB5/3/
All that is needed:
    table.table-fixedheader>tbody {
        display: block;
    }
    table.table-fixedheader>tbody {
        overflow-y: auto;
        height: 50px; /*placeholder:  override as needed*/
    }
    table.table-fixedheader>thead>tr>th, table.table-fixedheader>tbody>tr>td {
        float: left;
        width: 100px; /*placeholder:  override as needed*/
    }
See comments in JSFiddle for usage notes. This seems to work well.
