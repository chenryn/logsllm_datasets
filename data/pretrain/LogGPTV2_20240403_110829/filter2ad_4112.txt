ABSTRACT
The 6th ACM Cloud Computing Security Workshop (CCSW 2014)
is held in conjunction with the 21st ACM Conference on Computer
and Communications Security (CCS 2014), on November 7 at The
Scottsdale Plaza Resort, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.
Cloud computing is a new paradigm for computing as a utility
and refers to aggregation of virtualized computing resources man-
aged by a service provider and dynamically allocated to tenants on
demand. The “cloud” transforms the entire IT industry, enables
new business applications and services at reduced costs, but at the
same time raises new security and privacy issues that must be ad-
dressed before its wide adoption. The CCSW workshop series fo-
cuses on the security challenges and exciting research opportunities
that are brought about by recent developments in cloud computing.
The goal of the workshop is to explore the novel security and
privacy challenges in cloud computing, and foster the development
of new ideas and solutions that can be transitioned into practice.

INTRODUCTION
The paradigm of cloud computing has been revolutionizing to-
day’s information communication technologies, impacting and re-
deﬁning how data is stored, retrieved, processed and shared. Cloud
services provide an elastic, scalable, large-scale environment, typ-
ically marked by a high degree of resource virtualization, shar-
ing and dynamic allocation among tenants. Cloud computing has
been transforming traditional computing models to take advantage
of highly-parallelized, large-scale architectures that enable modern
applications. While the economic beneﬁts of cloud computing are
widely recognized, this new computing model creates security and
privacy requirements different from traditional environments. With
the wide adoption of the cloud computing paradigm, security, pri-
vacy, and availability of the involved operations, components, and
systems are becoming of increasing importance.
2. SCOPE
The CCSW 2014 workshop is the sixth edition of a workshop
series that is organized in conjunction with the ACM Computer
and Communications Security (CCS) conference. The goal of the
workshop is to explore the security and privacy challenges that are

raised by cloud computing, and foster development of new ideas
and solutions that can be transitioned into practice. The workshop
aims at providing a forum for researchers and practitioners to dis-
cuss and exchange ideas in all security aspects of cloud-centric and
outsourced computing.
The workshop seeks submissions from academia and industry on
a broad range of theoretical and practical aspects of cloud comput-
ing security. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the
following:
• practical cloud security solutions,
• practical cryptography for cloud security,
• secure cloud resource virtualization,
• network virtualization,
• secure data management outsourcing,
• practical privacy and integrity for outsourcing,
• foundations of cloud-centric threat models,
• secure and veriﬁable computation outsourcing,
• remote attestation mechanisms in clouds,
• sandboxing and VM-based enforcements,
• trust and policy management in clouds,
• secure identity management mechanisms,
• cloud-aware web service security paradigms,
• cloud-centric regulatory compliance,
• business and security risk models in the cloud,
• cost and usability models and their interaction with security
in clouds,
• scalability of security in global-size clouds,
• trusted computing technology and clouds,
• binary analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud
protection,
• cloud network security (DoS defense, IDS),
• security for cloud programming models,
• energy/costs/efﬁciency of security in clouds.

4. ORGANIZERS
The CCSW 2014 workshop received a total of thirty-six high
quality submissions, out of which twelve were selected by the pro-
gram committee through a rigorous review process. Each paper
was reviewed by three (or four, in case it was co-authored by a pro-
gram committee member) members of the program committee. The
accepted papers cover a wide range of areas in cloud security, in-
cluding secure cloud storage, secure computation, key management
and cloud system security. The workshop program also includes a
total of four invited sessions, three invited talks and one memorial
session.
We are delighted to have three keynote talks that bring new per-
spectives and insights from the viewpoint of the industry to the re-
search community.
The three invited talks are:
• Joanne Martin, CISO and VP for IT Risk, IBM, “Securing
Cloud Environments for Enterprise Computing”,
• David McGrew, Fellow, Cisco, “Privacy vs. Efﬁcacy in Cloud-
based Threat Detection ”,
• Bryan D. Payne, Director of Security Research, Nebula, “Re-
ducing the Cost of Security in the Cloud”.
The memorial session, organized by Elaine Shi, celebrates the
life of Emil Stefanov and his research contributions to cloud com-
puting security. It is entitled “Emil Stefanov: Bridging the Theory
and Practice of Cloud Computing Security”. The contributors to
this session (Srini Devadas, Ari Juels and Zygmunt Pizlo) discuss
Emil’s most impactful contributions to cloud security and beyond.
The CCSW 2014 workshop is organized by the following people:
• General Chair: Gail-Joon Ahn (Arizona State University, USA)
• Program Chairs: Alina Oprea (RSA Laboratories, USA) and
Reihaneh Safavi-Naini (University of Calgary, Canada)
• Steering Committee: Kristin Lauter (Microsoft Research, USA),
Adrian Perrig (ETH Zurich, Switzerland), Radu Sion – chair
(Stony Brook University, USA), Gene Tsudik (UC Irvine,
USA), Moti Yung (Google Inc., USA)
The program committee consisted of 33 members from academia
and industry specializing on different aspects of cloud computing
security.
