 **Dave Syer** opened **SPR-4855** and commented
Migrate Repeat and Retry from Spring Batch. They are almost completely self-
contained now (on trunk), so it shouldn't be a tough job - just need to decide
where to put them. Maybe the tests might have some batch dependencies, but
they would be easily factored out. There is also a dependency on some utility
stuff in org.springframework.batch.support which would need to be moved over
or equivalents provided in core.
The only real work will be migrating the StatefulRetryOperationsInterceptor
(very useful). It currently depends on ItemKeyGenerator and NewItemIdentifier,
for good reasons, so equivalents will have to be provided. When this is
refactored it might also be a good idea to revisit the whole stateful retry
concept - it could be implemented as an extension of the RetryOperations
interface instead of through a callback / policy pairing as it is now.
