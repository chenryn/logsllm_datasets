### Inspiration
#### The Story
The idea for this project was sparked during a post-pentest drinks session with a client. The conversation went something like this:

- **Client:** "So, if you own the Active Directory server, what exactly can you do?"
- **Me:** "The usual—control over every user, the ability to push policy updates, and more."
- **Client:** "Exchange can remotely wipe devices, so why not that too?"

This led to a series of questions and explorations.

#### Do We Really Need Exchange?
- **Initial Thought:** "Do we really need Exchange for that? Maybe we can just send the commands directly to the phone."
- **But...** There were doubts about the feasibility of this approach.

### That Couldn't Possibly Work
- **Skepticism:** "It couldn’t be that easy, could it? Surely SSL would prevent this, or there must be some other security measure in place."

### An Expert Opinion
- **Consultation:** I consulted with a Microsoft Exchange admin.
- **Expert Response:** "It should work fine, as long as SSL is disabled."
- **Decision:** Despite the skepticism, I decided to give it a try.

### Time to Get Started
- **Initial Step:** "Let’s get some packet dumps of a legitimate wipe operation. Installing Exchange shouldn’t be too hard, right? I’ve done Postfix and Sendmail before..."
- **Reality Check:** It turned out to be more challenging than expected.
