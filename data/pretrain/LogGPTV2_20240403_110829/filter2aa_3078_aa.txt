INSPIRATION 
The Story 
School of Computer & Security Science 
Edith Cowan University 
The Setting 
•  Post pentest drinks with client 
•  … So if you own the active directory server 
what exactly can you do? 
•  The norm, control of every user, 
ability to push policy updates, etc… 
•  Exchange can remotely wipe devices, 
so why not that too? 
School of Computer & Security Science 
Edith Cowan University 
Inspiration 
•  Do we really need exchange for that though? 
•  Maybe we just send the phone those 
commands directly 
•  but…

THAT COULDN’T POSSIBLY WORK 
School of Computer & Security Science 
Edith Cowan University 
Surely not… 
•  It couldn’t be that easy could it? 
•  Surely SSL would prevent this if nothing 
else. 
•  Maybe it uses some sort of secure 
exchange, shared secrets,  
something…

AN EXPERT OPINION 
•  I had a talk with a Microsoft Exchange 
admin type person… 
•  “It should work fine, as long as SSL is 
disabled” 
•  Damn.. Well, lets try it out anyway!

Exchange! 
•  Let’s get some packet dumps of a legit wipe 
operation 
•  Exchange can’t be that hard to install right? 
I’ve done postfix & sendmail before.. 
•  Crap.
