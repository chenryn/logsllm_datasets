### Analysis of Next-Hop Changes in the Interdomain Routing System

#### Introduction
After analyzing the results from the previous section, a key question arises: what proportion of the total set of next-hop changes over time is related to sustained changes (those that persist in the system for some duration) and what fraction is related to churn (changes that revert or change again in the near future)?

#### Decomposition of TRSD Time Series
To address this question, we decompose the Total Routing State Distance (TRSD) time series, denoted as \( r(i, 1) \), into two components: sustained TRSD (\( s(i, k) \)) and churn TRSD (\( c(i, k) \)).

- **Sustained TRSD (\( s(i, k) \))**: This component captures the portion of \( r(i, 1) \) that represents next-hop decisions that changed from \( t_i \) to \( t_{i+1} \) but did not subsequently change from \( t_{i+1} \) to \( t_{i+k} \).
- **Churn TRSD (\( c(i, k) \))**: This component captures the portion of \( r(i, 1) \) that represents next-hop decisions that changed from \( t_i \) to \( t_{i+1} \) and then changed again from \( t_{i+1} \) to \( t_{i+k} \).

Formally, we define \( s(i, k) \) as the average over all \( sp(i, k) \), where \( sp(i, k) \) is a measure for sustained changes for a specific prefix \( p \):

\[
sp(i, k) = \frac{\sum_{s \in S} \delta'(D'_s, p(i, k))}{|D'_p(i, k)|},
\]

where:
- \( D'_p(i, k) \) is the set of all sources for which the sets \( N_s, p(t_i) \), \( N_s, p(t_{i+1}) \), and \( N_s, p(t_{i+k}) \) are not empty.
- \( \delta'(D'_s, p(i, k)) \) is the fraction of elements in \( N_s, p(t_i) \cup N_s, p(t_{i+1}) \) that satisfy either of the following conditions:
  - The element is in \( N_s, p(t_i) \) but not in \( N_s, p(t_{i+1}) \) or \( N_s, p(t_{i+k}) \).
  - The element is in \( N_s, p(t_{i+1}) \) and \( N_s, p(t_{i+k}) \) but not in \( N_s, p(t_i) \).

Similarly, \( c(i, k) \) can be computed analogously. By definition, \( sp(i, k) \) and \( cp(i, k) \) form a partition of \( rp(i, 1) \), i.e., \( sp(i, k) + cp(i, k) = rp(i, 1) \) for all \( p \) and \( k \) with available routing information at times \( t_i \), \( t_{i+1} \), and \( t_{i+k} \).

#### Results and Observations
Figure 3 presents \( s(i, 7) \) and \( c(i, 7) \) for the daily dataset of 2011 (results for 2005 and 2008 are similar). The choice of \( k = 7 \) means that routing changes that persist for a week are considered sustained.

- **Impact on TRSD**: Comparing Figures 3(a) and 3(b), it is observed that sustained routing changes (\( s(i, 7) \)) have a more significant impact on TRSD than \( c(i, 7) \). The average value of \( s(i, 7) \) is around 0.007 (0.7%), while \( c(i, 7) \) has an average value of approximately 0.004 (0.4%).
- **Weekly Periodicity**: \( s(i, k) \) inherits the weekly periodicity of \( r(i, 1) \), while \( c(i, k) \) is more similar to noise. This periodicity suggests human interaction with the system, likely due to BGP policy management and configuration changes. Figure 3(c) shows that both curves indicate more activity during the workweek and less on weekends, with a more significant difference for sustained changes (\( s(i, k) \)).

#### Long-Term Analysis
Figure 4 presents \( s(i, 2) \) and \( c(i, 2) \) for the monthly dataset from 2005 to 2012, assuming routing changes that persist for one month are sustained. On average, about 3% of all routing decisions churn on a monthly basis, while about 8% show sustained changes. The sustained and churn TRSD on a monthly basis are greater than the corresponding values on a weekly basis, with a larger difference between sustained and churn TRSD on the monthly timescale. This indicates that sustained TRSD captures the accumulation of intentional changes over time, while churn TRSD reflects continuous background noise.

#### Stability of Sustained Changes
The relative stability of \( s(i, 2) \) in Figure 4 shows that large-scale, system-wide changes to Internet routing are rare. Notable peaks in sustained change occurred in mid-2006 and late-2012, affecting a large fraction of all prefixes. Further investigation of these events is ongoing.

#### Contribution of Sources
To determine the contribution of each source Autonomous System (AS) to TRSD, we sampled randomly chosen days in 2011 and computed the contribution of each AS to the total TRSD of that day. Figure 5(a) shows the Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function (CCDF) of this contribution, indicating that most ASes (approximately 90%) make little or no contribution to TRSD.

- **Temporal Consistency**: For the entire year of 2011, we computed the fraction of ASes necessary to achieve 90% of TRSD, finding that less than 2% of all ASes are needed to capture 90% of TRSD. This result holds for other datasets with a threshold of 2.5%.
- **Heavy-Hitter ASes**: To determine if the same ASes consistently contribute, we counted how many days each AS appeared among the top contributors. Figure 5(c) shows that approximately 40% of ASes that appear on at least one day, appear in at least 300 days, with about 20% appearing in all days. Many of these ASes are in or near the network core.

#### Conclusions and Future Work
In this study, we introduced TRSD, a new measure to characterize the rate of change in the interdomain routing system over long periods. We showed that the rate of change in routing decisions has been stable over time, despite network growth. We also decomposed TRSD into sustained and churn components, revealing a persistent weekly periodicity in sustained changes, suggesting intentional changes during the workweek. Additionally, we found that routing changes are concentrated among a small set of ASes, often those near or in the core.

Future research directions include:
- Grouping prefixes based on TRSD similarity.
- Applying TRSD to individual prefixes for a microscopic analysis.
- Exploring spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
- Understanding types of routing changes and their impact on neighbors.
- Analyzing router-level topologies.
- Identifying and understanding major structural changes or reorganizations in the Internet.
