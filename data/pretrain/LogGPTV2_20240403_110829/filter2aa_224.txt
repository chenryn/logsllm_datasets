# TLS Canary: Keeping Your Sensitive Data Safer

## Introduction
TLS Canary is a tool designed to enhance the security of your sensitive data, including personal images and other private information. This presentation will cover the basics of how it works and why it's important.

## Quote
"The good news is that there's no program named the 'dick pic' program. The bad news... they are still collecting everybody's information, including your dick pics."
- Edward Snowden

(Please don't sue us, John.)

## How the Internet Works
### HTTP
- **Your data is not protected.**
  - HTTP does not encrypt data, making it vulnerable to interception.
  
### HTTPS
- **Encryption suites**
  - HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data, providing a secure connection.
  
## Tubes Part Two
### HTTPS
- **SSL**
  - **Origin:** Developed by Netscape.
  - **How it works:** Establishes a secure connection between client and server.
  - **Why it’s outdated:** Vulnerable to various attacks.
- **TLS**
  - **New and improved:** Provides enhanced security features.
- **VPN**
  - **End-to-end vs. VPN:** Different methods of securing data.
  - **Difficulty:** Varies based on implementation.

## More Secure Protocols
### SSH
- **Does it blend?** Yes, it provides secure remote logins and file transfers.

### SFTP
- **Does it blend?** Yes, it offers secure file transfer over SSH.

### DNSSEC
- **Does it blend?** Yes, it adds a layer of security to DNS, ensuring data integrity.

## Certificates
### What Are They?
- **WTF?** Certificates are digital documents used to establish the identity and trustworthiness of a website or service.
- **How do they work?** Built on a chain of trust, starting from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
- **What do we do with them?** Used for identity verification, device authentication, and more.
- **Cert Chains:** A series of certificates that verify the authenticity of a certificate.
- **Cert Pinning:** Ensures that an application only trusts specific, pre-defined certificates.

### History
- **Secure Networking Program**
- **Netscape**
  - **Dr. Taher Elgamal:** Key figure in the development of SSL.
- **RFCs**
  - **6101:** SSL 1.0
  - **6176:** TLS 1.2
  - **TLS 1.3:** Latest and most secure version.

## How Does a Certificate Work?
- **Trust-based system:** Browsers trust certificates signed by a root CA.
- **Sessions negotiated by magic:** Complex cryptographic processes ensure secure communication.
- **You send your sensitive data through:** Ensured by the trust and encryption provided by certificates.

## Use Cases
- **Identity-related applications:**
  - Device certificates
  - User certificates
  - Application certificates
  - **Oprah Style distribution:** Certificates for everyone!

## Why TLS Canary?
- **Do we hate TLS?** No, but we want to improve its usage.
- **VPNs suck:** Often complex and not always reliable.
- **Systems we like:**
  - Ones not built on blind trust.

## Chain of Fools
- **Trusted by the world:**
  - You trust me, I sign your certificate, and now you are trusted by everyone who trusts me.
- **Potential issues:**
  - Misuse of trust can lead to security breaches.

## Pinning
- **Conceptual approach:**
  - Trust this and only this certificate.
- **Challenges:**
  - Hard to configure and varies in implementation.
  - **Google HSTS:** Example of a robust pinning mechanism.

## Interception
- **Cue scary music!**
- **iOS trusts about 226 CAs:**
  - Does not ask for user consent.
- **HTTPS breakdown:**
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks:** Can intercept and alter communications.

## MiTM Demo
- **Abnormal "Secure" Communication:**
  - Legal and illegal interceptions.
  - **Work machines, load balancers, .gov requests, and criminals.**

## TLSCanary
### Goals
- **Protecting your sensitive data from bored analysts.**
- **User awareness.**
- **Stopping shady activities.**

### Features
- **Certificate Difference (Cert Diff):** Detects changes in certificates.
- **In-browser certificate pinning.**
- **Root certificate audit.**
- **Alerts for potential security issues.**

### Limitations
- **Does not protect against compromised sites.**
- **Does not prevent hijacking.**
- **Does not protect data at rest.**

### TLSCanary Network
- **Global network:** Scalable and efficient.
- **How it works:**
  - A site presents a TLS certificate.
  - You send the certificate chain to TLSCanary.
  - TLSCanary compares the site's certificate chain.
  - Reports any discrepancies to you.

### Why Use TLSCanary?
- **Greater awareness.**
- **No caching of request data.**
- **Lightweight.**
- **Values the safety of your sensitive data.**

### Why Not Use It?
- **No reason not to.**
- **Unless you don’t trust us.**
- **You shouldn’t trust us.**
