As of version beta.1, the `.put` and `.post` methods require a string value for the `body` property (see also issue #6533). 

Manually converting the body object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify` in every instance of our calling code is cumbersome. Other HTTP clients, such as jQuery's `$.ajax`, accept either a string or an object for the body, and automatically handle the `JSON.stringify` conversion if an object is provided. 

To improve usability and consistency with other libraries, it would be beneficial to support both string and object types for the `body` property, with automatic stringification for objects.
