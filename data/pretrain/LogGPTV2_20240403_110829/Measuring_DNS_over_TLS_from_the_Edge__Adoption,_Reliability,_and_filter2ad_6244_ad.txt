study the support of DoT among the local resolvers of the probes, ﬁnding that
only 13 probes (i.e., 0.4%) have DoT-capable local resolvers, which indicates
that the adoption of DoT is still very low. When comparing the failure rates for
resolvers that respond to both Do53 and DoT queries, we observe that the DoT
failure rate is higher by 0.4–32.2% points (p.p.) for these resolvers. In particu-
lar, the majority of failures occurs due to timeouts, which is likely seen due to
middleboxes that drop packets associated with DoT on port 853. In terms of
response times, we ﬁnd that DoT is slower by more than 100 ms (in a large part
due to connection and session establishment), with response times between 130–
150 ms for the fastest resolvers and up to 230 ms when including slower ones.
Although the support of DoT among local resolvers is low, some local resolvers
achieve similar DoT response times (140–150 ms) to the faster public resolvers.
Local resolvers further have the lowest latency over Do53, however, both their
Do53 and DoT failure rates are higher compared to public resolvers.
With increasing support of DoT among mobile devices as shown by
Android [24] and Apple [38], increasing support by local resolvers is impor-
tant and necessary to avoid centralization of DNS traﬃc [27] to third parties
besides the ISP: Although this can be worked around by cycling through sev-
eral resolvers [12], this comes at the cost of higher resolution times (especially
206
T. V. Doan et al.
due to multiple connection and session establishments). As such, to reduce the
information leakage through DoT [18] to additional parties while also keeping
resolution times low, it is crucial for local resolvers to adopt encrypted DNS
and be discoverable within home networks [6]; as seen, DoT response times are
comparable between local and public resolvers.
Considering the issues with inﬂated failure rates for DoT due to ossiﬁcation,
one question that arises is whether to switch the development and deployment
focus to DoH [5,13] instead: Just like HTTPS, DoH runs over TCP/443, which
will make middlebox issues along the path less likely. Further, popular Web
browsers such as Chrome [37] and Firefox [9] already support DoH. However,
studies [34] have shown that DoH is more susceptible to ﬁngerprinting attacks
than DoT, and further drives centralization of DNS traﬃc [4,12,25,27]. As both
DoT and DoH bring latency overheads, DNS over QUIC [20] might be another
encrypted alternative with response times which are closer to Do53. Yet, legis-
lation may discourage and hinder the deployment of encrypted DNS and similar
protocols beyond the area of jurisdiction [21]. Thus, further advances and future
follow-up studies on encrypted DNS are required to get a better understanding.
