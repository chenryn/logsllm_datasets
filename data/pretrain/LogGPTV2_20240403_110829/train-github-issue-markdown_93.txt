Using Kubernetes 1.1.2 with Vagrant provider, running two pods:
    ./cluster/kubectl.sh get po
    NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    mysql-pod          1/1       Running   0          21s
    wildfly-rc-l2cto   1/1       Running   0          21s
One of the pods was deleted:
    ./cluster/kubectl.sh delete po wildfly-rc-l2cto
    pod "wildfly-rc-l2cto" deleted
Watching the status of pods are shown as:
    ./cluster/kubectl.sh get -w po
    NAME               READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
    mysql-pod          1/1       Running       0          1m
    wildfly-rc-2o8vd   1/1       Running       0          13s
    wildfly-rc-l2cto   1/1       Terminating   0          1m
    NAME               READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
    wildfly-rc-l2cto   0/1       Terminating   0          1m
    wildfly-rc-l2cto   0/1       Terminating   0         1m
    wildfly-rc-l2cto   0/1       Terminating   0         1m
Two issues:
  * Refreshed status shows the only for the changed pod and shows it three times
  * Even after waiting for 5 minutes, the status does not refresh to Terminated
Just checking the status as `kubectl.sh get po` shows that the pod has been
terminated. But its confusing that with `-w` the status never updates to
Terminated or something intuitive.
