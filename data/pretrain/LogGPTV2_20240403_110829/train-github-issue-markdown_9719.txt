Recently upgraded from 0.35 to 1.3, and now, simply put, the electron process
(specifically the `webContents`?) crashes every time a request is made to an
HTTP URL.
  * Electron version: 1.3.3
  * Operating system: Arch Linux
There's no discernible error message, the window goes white and the devtools
report they have been disconnected, and the `mainWindow.webContents` throws a
`crashed` event but not much else. The Network tab of the devtools shows that
the request begins and reaches Waiting (TTFB), but does not start actually
downloading the content.
I've tried requesting pages using both the `request` and `needle` libraries,
and both cause the crash. HTTP calls in the server (i.e., where
`app.on('ready')` is defined) do NOT crash the client in any form.
Not sure if I've missed something obvious. Any help would be appreciated.
