Trying with 1.0.1
curl 'http://localhost:9200/foobar*/_stats?pretty&clear=1'
The indices section has all my indices. :(
Trying with 0.90.12
{  
"error" : "IndexMissingException[[foobar-*] missing]",  
"status" : 404  
}
Either the 0.90 solution or an empty indices section would be better then
returning all.  
This may happen with other APIs, haven't tried
