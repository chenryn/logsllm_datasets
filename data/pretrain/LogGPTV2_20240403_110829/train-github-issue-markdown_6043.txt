Hello,

I am new to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and have encountered some confusion while using the `SVC` class. Specifically, I noticed that in the documentation, it states:

> "The multiclass support is handled according to a one-vs-one (OvO) scheme."

However, in the input argument section, it mentions:

> "decision_function_shape: 'ovo', 'ovr', default='ovr'"

I tried both 'ovo' and 'ovr' with a linear kernel, expecting a significant difference in training time. My dataset consists of 1694 classes, each with 512 features, and N instances per class (where N ranges from 1 to 10). Theoretically, I expected a notable difference between O(n) and O(n^2) complexity.

However, I observed similar training times for both 'ovo' and 'ovr'. Is it the case that `SVC` uses 'ovr' by default but switches to 'ovo' when dealing with multi-class scenarios? It seems that changing the `decision_function_shape` parameter does not have the expected effect.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
