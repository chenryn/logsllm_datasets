Hi, I am new to SVM and get a little confused when using SVC:
In the document, its description says
> The multiclass support is handled according to a one-vs-one scheme.
while in input argument fields, it says
> decision_function_shape : ‘ovo’, ‘ovr’, default=’ovr’
I personally tried both ovo and ovr with linear kernel, expected to get a
large difference in training time, but got similar result. My data consists of
1694 classes with 512 features, and N instances per class (N=1~10).
Theoretically, I expect the difference between O(n) and O(n^2) is significant.
Is SVC by default uses ovr, but is fixed to use ovo when applying multi-class
scenario? Changing decision_function_shape seems not working.
