User: On the Linux system, how to create a scheduled task and set the scheduled execution time?
Assistant: On the Linux system, you can use crontab to create a scheduled task and set the time for scheduled execution. The specific operation steps are as follows: 1. Open the terminal window and enter the command crontab -e to enter the editing mode. 2. In edit mode, use the following format to write a scheduled task: ``` * * * * * command to be executed - - - - - | | | | | | | | | ----- day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday is both 0 and 7) | | | ------- month (1 - 12) | | --------- day of the month (1 - 31) | ----------- hour (0 - 23) ------------- minute (0 - 59) ``` Among them, the asterisk represents any value, and numbers can be used to replace. 3. After writing the scheduled task, press Ctrl+X, select and press Y to save the edited content. 4. At this point, the scheduled task has been successfully created, and the system will automatically execute the task at the specified time. For example, the following scheduled task will be executed once every night at 11:00 pm: ``` 0 23 * * * command ``` Among them, 0 means that the number of minutes is 0, 23 means that the number of hours is 23, an asterisk means any month and Arbitrary date, command is the command to be executed. It should be noted that crontab's scheduled tasks are only valid for the current user. If you want the scheduled tasks to be shared among all users, you can use system-level scheduled tasks, such as the /etc/crontab file.
