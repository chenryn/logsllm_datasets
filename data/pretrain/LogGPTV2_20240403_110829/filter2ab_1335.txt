### Title: BlackHat US-21: Diving into Spooler: Uncovering LPE and RCE Vulnerabilities in Windows Printer

Ten years ago, a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Printer Spooler was exploited by Stuxnet, a notorious worm that caused significant damage to Iran's nuclear enrichment centrifuges and infected over 45,000 networks. Despite the passage of time, the Spooler service continues to be a source of numerous vulnerabilities, some of which remain unknown to the public but pose serious security risks.

Over the past several months, our team has focused on the Spooler service, yielding fruitful results. Our research began with an in-depth analysis of the PrintDemon vulnerability, which inspired us to explore further. We discovered a method to bypass Microsoft's patch for PrintDemon. However, as soon as Microsoft released a new update, we found another way to exploit the vulnerability. This experience reinforced our belief that the Spooler service remains a viable attack surface, even after more than a decade of scrutiny by security researchers.

In our exploration of the inner workings of the Printer Spooler, we uncovered several zero-day vulnerabilities. Some of these are more potent and easier to exploit than PrintDemon, while others can be triggered remotely, leading to potential remote code execution (RCE). These findings underscore the ongoing need for robust security measures and continuous monitoring of the Spooler service.
