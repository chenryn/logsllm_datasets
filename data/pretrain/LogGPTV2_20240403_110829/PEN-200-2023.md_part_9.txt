CLD-100 provides information on important cloud concepts and technologies.

**Developer:**
A Software Developer writes computer programs ranging from core operating system components to desktop, mobile, and web applications. This role is suitable for those who enjoy designing elegant and efficient programmatic solutions. Depending on the type of development, the OffSec Library offers resources to help learners understand attack vectors and create secure software. PEN-200 covers general software vulnerabilities, while WEB courses at the 200 and 300 levels focus on web development. EXP-301 and EXP-312 are useful for those programming in memory-unsafe languages like C.

**DevSecOps Engineer:**
A DevSecOps Engineer integrates security into all stages of the software development lifecycle, automating security testing and other security-related processes. This role is suitable for individuals with an understanding of Continuous Integration/Continuous Development (CI/CD) pipelines and tools, an interest in security testing automation, and the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. The WEB and PEN courses at the 200 and 300 levels, along with CLD-100, provide relevant training.

**Site Reliability Engineer:**
A Site Reliability Engineer ensures and improves the availability and performance of software systems. This role is ideal for those with software development experience and an interest in using automation to monitor, alert, and respond to reliability-related issues. CLD-100 in the OffSec library covers key technologies like containers and Kubernetes.

**System Hardener (System Administrator):**

### 3.7 What’s Next?

We hope this Module has provided a high-level understanding of the cybersecurity landscape. Regardless of your specific career path in this expanding field, most learners will benefit from starting with the Fundamentals. The Effective Learning Strategies Module is designed to orient each learner to OffSec’s teaching pedagogy.

To begin diving into more hands-on technical Modules, we recommend starting with Linux Basics, Windows Basics, Networking, and various Scripting Modules, in that order. These fundamental areas represent the most important prerequisites for an aspiring cybersecurity professional. If you already have experience in these areas, feel free to move on to any Module that captures your interest. We wish you the best of success in your learning journey!

### 4. Effective Learning Strategies

This Module is intended to provide students with a better understanding of learning strategies and a preview of the OffSec instruction style. After completing this Module, students should be able to effectively plan how to approach the coursework ahead.

#### 4.1 Learning Theory

Let’s begin with a basic discussion of Learning Theory. We’ll make some general observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly evolving) understanding of how students learn.

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the general state of our understanding about education and education theory.
2. Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding.
3. Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including “The Curve of Forgetting” and cognitive load.

While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about 15 minutes to complete.

#### 4.1.1 What We Know and What We Don’t

Although humans have always taught, research into learning theory only began within the past 100 years. Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools, such as the ideal classroom size and the impact of physical activities on academic performance. While these studies may not seem directly relevant to cybersecurity, they highlight that learning is influenced by factors beyond the student’s raw capability. A student’s past performance is a poor predictor of future success, and external events and circumstances can significantly affect performance.

Second, ongoing educational research suggests that the notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought. With this in mind, OffSec designs our courses around current, established academic research regarding learning theory, and we continuously seek to improve our methods.

#### 4.1.2 Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding

Understanding education in simpler terms, one way to demonstrate learning is through the creation and retrieval of memories. For example, if we learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, `mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt`, we hope to remember this command when needed. A great deal of research has gone into how memory works and how to create strong memories and learn new skills.

To improve memory, we can:
1. Improve the quality of information we take in.
2. Improve the way or mode in which we receive information.
3. Improve our practice of retrieving information.

- **Improve the quality of information we take in:** Our training material should be accurate and easy to understand. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training provider.
- **Improve the way or mode in which we receive information:** Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats, such as videos or images. A safe, distraction-free environment also aids in learning.

By focusing on these aspects, we can create a highly-effective learning environment that equips students to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience or performance.
