This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objective:
• Identify career opportunities in cybersecurity
There are increasingly many job roles available within the larger fieyld of Cybersecurity. The field
expands extremely fast, and organizations use disparate titles to describe similar roles, making it
impossible to list every potential career. k
With this in mind, let’s explore various cybersecurity job roles. We’ll describe their day-to-day
functions and provide some guidance regarding the kisnd of person that might be interested in
pursuing different roles. We’ll also mention areas in the OffSec Training Library where learners
can pursue more Modules related to each role. o

3.7 What’s Next?
We hope this Module has provided a high-level understanding of the cybersecurity landscape. No
matter where you want to go in this expanding field, most learners will benefit from starting with
the Fundamentals. The Effective Learning Strategies Module is designed to orient each learner to
OffSec’s teaching pedagogy.
To begin diving into more hands-on technical Modules, we recommend beginning with the Linux
Basics, Windows Basics, Networking, and various Scripting Modules, in that order. These
fundamental areas represent the most important prerequisites for an aspiring cybersecurity
professional. Should you already have experience in these areas, you are welcome to move on to
any Module that captures your interest. We wish you the best of success in your learning journey!

4 Effective Learning Strategies
This Module is intended to provide students a better understanding of learning strategies as well
as a preview of the OffSec instruction style and what to expect. After completing this Module,
students should be able to effectively plan how to best approach the coursework ahead.
Let’s briefly review why this is an important topic The information covered will not only help
students prepare to succeed in the training ahead, but will also be useful to cyber security
professionals in the long term. Since both technology and the security landscape are constantly
evolving and changing (we’ll explore this more later), professionals must continually learn and
grow. Finding success and satisfaction in this field is often tied to our ability to become efficient
and comfortable learners.
y
We will cover the following Learning Units in this Module:
• Learning Theory
k
• Unique Challenges to Learning Technical Skills
s
• The OffSec Training Methodology
• A Case Study Regarding Executable Permission
o
• Common Methods and Strategies
• Advice and Suggestions on Exams n
• Practical Steps
i
Each learner moves at their own pace, but this Module should take approximately 1 hour and 45
z
minutes to complete.
4.1 Learning TheoDry
Let’s begin with a very basic discussion of Learning Theory. We’ll make some general
observations about this field of study and examine the current state of our (constantly-evolving)
understanding of how students learn.
In general, this Learning Unit and the next will illuminate some of the problems and difficulties
that individuals face when learning new subjects.
This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the general state of our understanding about education and education theory
2. Understand the basics of memory mechanisms and dual encoding
3. Recognize some of the problems faced by learners, including “The Curve of Forgetting” and
cognitive load
While each student will learn at their own pace, this Learning Unit should take about 15 minutes
to complete.

4.1.1 What We Know and What We Don’t
Although we humans have always taught, we have only recently (within the past 100 years) begun
researching learning theory.126
Some of this research focuses on the structure and purpose of schools themselves. For example,
a great deal of research ponders the ideal classroom size,127 whether or not activities in gym
class can help a student in science class,128 and so on. Although these studies may not initially
seem relevant to our focus on cyber security, a few key aspects of this research are worth
mentioning.
First, learning is not entirely dependent on the student. The teacher, the material, the education
format, and a variety of other factors affect success more than a student’s raw capability. In fact,
a student’s past performance is a poor predictor of future success,129 and external events and
circumstances can drastically affect a student’s performance.130 y
Second, as new educational studies are constantly released, it’s clear there’s still much to be
k
discovered about the mechanics of our memory. This includes research suggesting that the
notion of learning modes (or learning styles) is more of a myth than previously thought.131,132
s
With this in mind, OffSec designs our courses around current, established academic research
regarding learning theory, and (partially because we aim to be perpetual learners) we’re constantly
o
seeking to improve our methods.
As instructors, our ultimate goal is to create a highly-effective learning environment that equips
n
students to excel in the ever-changing field of information security, regardless of past experience
or performance in the field.
i
However, before we can discuss more practical strategies, let’s explore some of the current
z
research in the field of learning theory to understand how it’s best applied.
D
4.1.2 Memory Mechanisms and Dual Coding
It can be a bit overwhelming to think of education as a whole, so let’s try to understand it in more
simple terms first. One of the ways we can demonstrate that we’ve “learned” something is if we
are able to create and retrieve a memory.
For example, we might learn a specific command to rename a file in Linux, mv oldfilename.txt
newfilename.txt. Later, we might find ourselves at a computer, needing to rename a file. We hope
that in that situation, away from our text book and any instructional material, we’ll remember this

particular command and syntax. Ideally, we can enter the command from memory and
successfully rename the file.
A great deal of research has gone into how memory works and how we create strong memories
and learn new skills.133 A full review of all of the details is out of scope for this Module, but in
short, we might summarize by saying that we can improve memory by doing the following:
1. Improve the quality of information we take in
2. Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3. Improve our practice of retrieving information
We will explore all of these more, but for now, let’s review them quickly:
• Improve the quality of information we take in: At a basic level, we expect our training material
y
to be accurate. We might need explanatory paragraphs (like this one), written in a simple,
easy-to-understand manner. This responsibility generally falls to the instructor or training
provider. k
• Improve the way or mode in which we receive information: This could include multiple
s
approaches. Information might be more easily retained if presented in multiple formats,
such as videos or images. This might also comprise, for example, a safe, distraction-free
environment for the student. o
