User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Remove all recurring meetings scheduled by terminated user I am looking for a way to efficiently and effectively remove all meetings that a terminated user may have created during their tenure.

Currently, our group has to grant admin access to the user's mailbox, create a profile as that user, load up outlook and begin cleaning out recurring meetings and room bookings.

I'm hoping there is a much simpler way, powershell perhaps, that can do this task.

Assistant: You cannot do this with the Exchange Management Shell alone, you would have to implement an Exchange Web Services client to do so.

An easier option than creating a new profile and using outlook would definitely be to use Outlook Web App:


Grant operator Full Access on the Mailbox
Operator logs in to http://webmail.company.net/owa/ 
Change Mailbox by either:


Options -> Change Mailbox
Change location URI to http://webmail.company.net/owa/oldemployee@company.net/



Now the operator can switch to the users calendar and edit appointments without having to create a new profile and launching Outlook
