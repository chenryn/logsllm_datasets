I'm trying to test that a user with the wrong permissions sees the correct
response when visting a page that has a csrf token in the path.
I've added a Behat context step to create a csrf token using the
'security.csrf.token_manager', however then visit the page with this token in
the path, I get a "Cannot set session ID after the session has started" 500
error.
Can anyone advise what I'm doing wrong, or how I work around this, please?
        /**
         * @When /^I go to the application admin archive page for "(?P[^"]*)" application (?P\d+) with a valid token$/
         *
         * @param string $status
         * @param int    $number
         */
        public function iGoToTheApplicationAdminArchivePageForApplicationWithAValidToken($status, $number)
        {
            $tokenManager = $this->kernel->getContainer()->get('security.csrf.token_manager');
            $token        = $tokenManager->getToken(ApplicationAdminController::CSRF_ARCHIVE);
            var_dump($token);
            $this->visitAdminPage('archive', $status, $number, ['token' => $token]);
        }
