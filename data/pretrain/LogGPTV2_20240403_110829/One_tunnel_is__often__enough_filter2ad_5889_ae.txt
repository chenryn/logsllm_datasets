polluted if its BGP path to the attacker is shorter than its path to the
victim [39]. For each attack and a given ARROW deployment we
see what fraction of the sources remain unpolluted, i.e., able to send
trafﬁc to the victim through any of the ARROW path segments.
Figure 13 shows the CCDF of the hijack attacks. The x-axis shows
the fraction of sources remaining polluted as a result of the attack
versus the corresponding fraction of attacks that resulted in at most
p pollution on the y-axis. We compare ARROW deployments of
various sizes with BGP routing.
We observe that all three deployments of ARROW provide sig-
niﬁcant protection against preﬁx hijacks: For 75% of the attacks,
a single ARROW AS cuts down pollution to 5% or less. Without
ARROW the same scenario results in up to 30% pollution. An
ARROW deployment on only four tier-1s eliminates almost all of
the unreachability caused by preﬁx hijacks. We conclude that even
a small ARROW deployment provides an effective means to com-
bat preﬁx hijack attacks.
5.9 Reliable Performance
For redundant ARROW paths to be useful, it is important that
the performance of these paths is not signiﬁcantly worse than the
original BGP path. We evaluate the performance of paths available
in an ARROW deployment compared to the respective BGP path.
For this purpose we use the PoP-level link latencies provided by
the iPlane dataset. Using the same methodology as in previous
subsections, we ask the question: what is the fraction of sources
that have an alternative ARROW path with an end-to-end latency
that is at most X% that of the original path?
We assume no overhead for ARROW routing in this simula-
tion and solely look at the measured path latencies from the iPlane
dataset. Hence, these results are slightly skewed towards ARROW
and we expect an experimental evaluation on a real deployment
to look slightly less encouraging for ARROW. Figure 14 shows a
CDF of the ratio of the end-to-end latency achieved by an ARROW

path and the latency of the equivalent BGP path between the same
source and destination PoP for a total of 1,143,652 PoP-level paths.
We observe that in a deployment with 2 and 4 ARROW ASes,
only 24% and 20% of ARROW paths have a latency slightly (up
to 20%) worse than that of their equivalent BGP path, respectively.
With 2 ARROW ASes, more than 76% of the sources actually ex-
perience an improvement in the end-to-end latency while using an
ARROW path. As expected, the gains are even slightly higher for
a deployment of 4 ARROW ASes.
We conclude that ARROW does not degrade the end-to-end la-
tency for the vast majority of paths and, in fact, has the potential
to improve their performance. This can serve as an important fac-
tor for ISPs in attracting trafﬁc from the greater Internet. It also
shows that using ARROW does not have to come at a performance
tradeoff for most users.
6. RELATED WORK
Our goal in this work is to quantify the extent that a simple re-
mote tunneling model such as ARROW can address a range of In-
ternet vulnerabilities, particularly given the recent trend towards a
ﬂatter Internet topology [20] and very high-bandwidth servers.
Fifteen years ago, Detour [3, 29] observed that well-chosen in-
direct paths were often more reliable and higher performance than
direct paths through the Internet, although it stopped short of sug-
gesting this as a universal solution because processing costs would
have been prohibitive at the time. The success of various Detour-
like systems built by companies such as Akamai SureRoute and
others have shown that better Internet reliability is commercially
viable. Likewise the widespread move towards multihomed enter-
prises is proof of the value of improved reliability to end users.
Our work goes beyond earlier studies of Detour and multihoming
to consider the range of attacks, both inadvertent and intentional,
against the Internet. At an architectural level, a key distinction with
Detour is that ARROW routes are composable. A sequence of AR-
ROW circuits through participating providers will deliver packets
at a given rate along the path, barring failure. Detour routes provide
no such guarantee.
Source control over routing is an old idea. Loose source rout-
ing in the Internet is widely but not universally blocked [15] due
to concerns about its possible use in denial-of-service attacks. This
has led to a set of efforts that provide joint control over routes be-
tween the ISPs along the path and the endpoint. The most ﬂexible
of these is Icing [24].
Icing attempts to head off subversion of
routing advertisements by asking every entity along the path to ap-
Figure 14: CDF showing the ratio of end-to-end latency of an

latency of the equivalent BGP path versus the cumulative frac-
tion of paths with up to that ratio. Two ARROW deployments

prove the use of the entire path; no trafﬁc ﬂows unless everyone
agrees. Icing does not, however, attempt to address incremental or
partial adoption. Yang el al. [37] propose a solution that allows
both senders and receivers to choose AS-level routes to the Internet
core, with the end-to-end path the concatenation of the two seg-
ments. Routing as a Service [22] recognized the conﬂict between
users who want control over end-to-end paths and ISPs who desire
control over how their infrastructure is used. To resolve this con-
ﬂict, the authors introduce a separate entity that contracts with both
ASes and customers and establishes paths that are acceptable to all
entities.
Although ARROW is in many ways a simpler model, our re-
sults should apply to these other models as well. A goal of our
work is to help answer whether a simpler model is sufﬁcient for
addressing known malicious and non-malicious errors, as well as
to point a way towards incremental adoption of one of these more
far-reaching solutions.
We also borrow a number of ideas from other proposals. Dy-
namic resolution of circuit ID’s was introduced by ATM. Our topol-
ogy announcements are similar to those in pathlet routing [10], al-
though we assume users will want to bind trafﬁc PoP to PoP rather
than only ISP to ISP. By handing topology announcements out of
band (that is, not via BGP), we make it easier for ISPs to add infor-
mation such as price and expected performance to various preﬁxes.
Using indirection as a method for addressing denial of service orig-
inated with the Internet Indirection Infrastructure (i3) [31]; packet
authenticators for governing access to a tunnel was introduced by
SOS and Mayday [4, 18].
Considerable effort has gone into incremental changes to BGP
to address speciﬁc vulnerabilities. For example, MIRO [36] is a
multi-path interdomain routing protocol that allows ISPs to nego-
tiate alternate paths as needed. MIRO is designed to be an incre-
mentally deployable extension to BGP. RBGP [19] proposes to use
pre-computed backup paths to provide reliable delivery during peri-
ods where the network is adapting to failures. ARROW has similar
goals, but obtains additional deployability beneﬁts since it doesn’t
require changes to the inter-domain routing protocol. A single ISP
can unilaterally provide ARROW service and obtain revenues di-
rectly from end users who would beneﬁt from the service.

The current Internet, however, is
unable to meet the availability demands of these emerging and fu-
ture uses. In this paper, we attempt to identify the minimal changes
needed for the Internet to support such mission critical data trans-
missions.
This paper presents a mechanism to enable end users, enter-
prises, and governments to stitch together reliable end to end paths
by leveraging highly reliable intradomain path segments. At the
core is a protocol called Advertised Reliable Routing Over Way-
points, which allows users to provision a path across a remote ISP.
We outlined the design of ARROW, examined how it can be used
to enhance the robustness and security of end-to-end paths, and de-
scribed an implementation of its key components. Our evaluations
show that ARROW imposes only minor overheads to Internet rout-
ing infrastructure and can provide signiﬁcant resiliency and perfor-
mance beneﬁts even when deployed by only a limited number of
ISPs. Finally, ARROW provides the fabric for additional services
that can be deployed on top of it. To show that this is feasible,
we presented two of our own implementations: a DoS protection
service and a content distribution network.
