If I close Atom with some files and folders open, and then reopen Atom,
nothing is remembered. The only thing that is open is a new blank file.
I feel like this worked at some point in the past for me, but I wasn't able to
find a version that worked when I tried the specific zip files. I am currently
using 0.209.0. I also tried this with --safe and the same thing happens.
I can see that the editor-giberish files are being created in the storage
folder, but I never see Atom try to read those files when I launch Atom. I
used Procmon to check for this access.
