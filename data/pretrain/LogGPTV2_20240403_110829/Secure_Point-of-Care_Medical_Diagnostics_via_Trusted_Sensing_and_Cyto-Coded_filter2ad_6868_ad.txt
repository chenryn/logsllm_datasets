First, the ninth electrode, for all signals (Figure 11), only
generates one peak while all other electrodes generate double
peaks. This is a minor fabrication ﬂaw of the sensor that
can be solved by adding another input electrode after the
ninth electrode. Second, successive electrodes do not generate
distinct non-differentiable peaks. Instead, a passing bead has an
inﬂuence on multiple adjacent electrodes. Figure 11b illustrate
this effect where the double peak at time 41.42s is not a double
clone of the signal at time 41.65s. Similarly, if we consider
multiple beads passing through the channel, we can notice that,
due to the small distance interval between electrodes by com-
parison to the longer distance separating beads passing through
the channel, there is a long delay between groups of peaks
corresponding to a speciﬁc cell. This effect is illustrated in
Figure 11d where all the electrodes are selected; the resulting
signature is a relatively ﬂat periodic train of 17 peaks, which
is dissimilar from randomly passing cells. This information
could be leveraged by a domain knowledgeable attacker to
recover the true number of cells in the sample and thus the ﬁnal
diagnostic outcome. Both limitations can be solved by either
putting more space between the electrodes or by selecting an
electrode key pattern that does not use successive electrodes.
Both of these changes are minor design modiﬁcations that
increase the ciphertext strength against adversarial information
disclosure attempts.
B. Data Transfer and Cloud-Based Analysis
To validate the accuracy of MedSen platform, we per-
formed runtime diagnosis analysis multiple times over several
blood samples. MedSen’s typical diagnostics procedure takes a
0.01 mL of blood sample and complete all the steps, including
sensor-side encryption, cloud processing, MedSen decoding
and diagnostics, within 1 minute. However, to exercise and
evaluate MedSen’s ability to handle large data sets, we ran
each sample through our bio-sensor for 3 h which generated
approximately 600MB of encrypted bio-sensor measurements,
captured in csv ﬁles. To improve the network transfer ef-
ﬁciency, MedSen implements zip data compression on the
smartphone. This reduced the sample size to 240MB. This
provides a more adaptable solution to smartphone data plans
when interacting with our cloud service. As discussed earlier
in the paper, the key size turns out to be less than 1 MB,
i.e., 0.12MB accurately, that stays on the MedSen controller
through the whole experiment. MedSen’s design also allows
(not implemented) sharing of the generated keys with trusted

eight frequency carriers. The electrical impedance measure-
ment between the electrode pairs in the microﬂuidic channel
is modulated by the carrier frequencies. In recovering the
signal measurement, the signal is demodulated by the same
carrier frequencies. MedSen outputs the measurement from
eight channels corresponding to the carrier frequencies, per
measurement of electrical impedance. The choice of excitation
voltage, frequencies, and measurement bandwidth is based
on empirical test results of the system. The input electrode
of the microﬂuidic channel is excited with a combination of
[500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 2000, 3000, 4000]kHz carrier fre-
quencies. Excitation voltage is at 1 V per excitation signal.
The recovered signal is sampled at 450 Hz. The recovering
low pass ﬁlter is set to have cut off frequency at 120 Hz.
VII. EVALUATIONS
In our experiments, we evaluated the performance of the
MedSen using micron-sized synthetic beads (synthetic beads
7.8 μm and 3.58 μm - MicroChem) as well as blood cells,
suspended in PBS 0.9 %. The solution is pumped through the
microﬂuidic channel at a rate of 0.08 μL.
A. Sensor-Based Data Encryption
Figure 11 illustrates how we can duplicate data generated
for one electrode into multiple signals preventing the disclosure
of number of beads passing through the channel. The ﬁgure
shows the response of the bio-sensor to the 7.8 μm synthetic
bead solution at 2 MHz. When selecting the random sequence
of output electrodes, the remaining unselected electrodes need
to be grounded to prevent
interference. Maxim Integrated
MAX14661 16 : 2 multiplexer provides a dual output channel
that can be utilized for this purpose. The encrypting algorithm
will select a random sequence of output electrodes and route
it to the ﬁrst output channel of the multiplexer. The remaining
unselected electrodes will be routed to the second output
channel, which is proceeding to ground port. Figure 11a shows
the measured response of the bio-sensor when one output

access the cloud-based analysis outcomes remotely.
In peak-analysis, the accuracy of the bio-sensor is evaluated
by comparing the empirically detected peaks and the estimated
elements passing through the microﬂuidic channel. We diluted
the 7.8 μm and 3.58 μm beads with PBS, which is a commonly
used biological buffer that mimicks physiological samples like
blood. We diluted at different concentrations to evaluate the
empirical peak detection. The estimated number of elements
in the solution is calculated according to the concentration
information provided by the manufacturer, where we purchase
the sample from. Four samples of each concentration are
collected. The bead count data is taken from the ﬁrst 5 min

Fig. 14. MedSen’s peak analysis performance on a computer and smartphone
from each sample. Figure 12 and 13 show the correlation of the
empirical peak detection to the estimated peak counts in the
microﬂuidic channel for 7.8 μm and 3.58 μm synthetic beads.
As expected, the empirical peak detection varies linearly to the
estimated peaks at different concentrations. The difference in
bead counts is due to several reasons. For synthetic beads, the
longer the experiments run, the more error would be expected
on the empirical bead counts as many beads sink to the bottom
of the inlet well and never make it to the sensor downstream
in the micro-channel. The other reason for the bead count loss
is due to the beads being adsorbed to microﬂuidic channel
walls. These are issues that can be ultimately resolved with
optimization of channel material and surface chemistry, which
was beyond the scope of the current work.
Figure 14 shows a performance comparison of the peak
detection algorithm, when it runs on a standard computer
system (possibly a cloud virtual machine) and on a smartphone
device. It is noteworthy that a standard system provides much
better performance than a mobile device, as the sample size
grows larger. Aside from the storage capabilities, the enhanced
computing power motivates the use of a cloud based service for
handling peak detection and post-processing rather than using
the smartphone. For smaller samples, however, MedSen could
be conﬁgured to perform the peak counting signal processing
on the smartphone locally.
