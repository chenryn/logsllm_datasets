### Sensor Performance and Limitations

1. **Electrode Response Anomalies:**
   - The ninth electrode, for all signals (Figure 11), generates only one peak, whereas all other electrodes generate double peaks. This is a minor fabrication flaw in the sensor that can be resolved by adding an additional input electrode after the ninth electrode.
   - Successive electrodes do not produce distinct, non-overlapping peaks. Instead, a passing bead influences multiple adjacent electrodes. Figure 11b illustrates this effect, where the double peak at 41.42 seconds is not a duplicate of the signal at 41.65 seconds.

2. **Signal Overlap and Delay:**
   - When multiple beads pass through the channel, the small distance between electrodes compared to the longer distance separating the beads results in a significant delay between groups of peaks corresponding to a specific cell. This is shown in Figure 11d, where the resulting signature is a relatively flat periodic train of 17 peaks, which differs from the patterns of randomly passing cells.
   - This information could be exploited by a knowledgeable attacker to infer the true number of cells in the sample, thereby compromising the diagnostic outcome. Both limitations can be addressed by increasing the spacing between electrodes or by selecting an electrode key pattern that avoids successive electrodes. These design modifications are minor but can significantly enhance the security of the ciphertext against adversarial information disclosure attempts.

### Data Transfer and Cloud-Based Analysis

To validate the accuracy of the MedSen platform, we conducted multiple runtime diagnostic analyses on several blood samples. The typical diagnostic procedure for MedSen involves processing a 0.01 mL blood sample and completing all steps, including sensor-side encryption, cloud processing, MedSen decoding, and diagnostics, within one minute. To test MedSen's ability to handle large datasets, each sample was run through our bio-sensor for three hours, generating approximately 600 MB of encrypted bio-sensor measurements, captured in CSV files.

- **Data Compression:**
  - To improve network transfer efficiency, MedSen implements zip data compression on the smartphone, reducing the sample size to 240 MB. This makes the solution more adaptable to smartphone data plans when interacting with our cloud service.
  - The key size used in the experiment is less than 1 MB (precisely 0.12 MB) and remains on the MedSen controller throughout the experiment.
  - MedSen's design also allows (though not yet implemented) sharing of the generated keys with trusted parties, such as the patient's practitioners, enabling remote access to the cloud-based analysis outcomes.

### Electrical Impedance Measurement

The microfluidic sensor uses eight frequency carriers to modulate the electrical impedance measurement between the electrode pairs in the microfluidic channel. The excitation voltage is set to 1 V per excitation signal, and the carrier frequencies are [500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 2000, 3000, 4000] kHz. The recovered signal is sampled at 450 Hz, and the low-pass filter has a cutoff frequency of 120 Hz. The choice of these parameters is based on empirical test results of the system.

### Evaluations

In our experiments, we evaluated the performance of MedSen using micron-sized synthetic beads (7.8 μm and 3.58 μm - MicroChem) and blood cells suspended in PBS 0.9%. The solution was pumped through the microfluidic channel at a rate of 0.08 μL.

- **Sensor-Based Data Encryption:**
  - Figure 11 illustrates how data generated for one electrode can be duplicated into multiple signals to prevent the disclosure of the number of beads passing through the channel. The figure shows the response of the bio-sensor to a 7.8 μm synthetic bead solution at 2 MHz.
  - When selecting a random sequence of output electrodes, the remaining unselected electrodes need to be grounded to prevent interference. The Maxim Integrated MAX14661 16:2 multiplexer provides a dual output channel for this purpose. The encrypting algorithm selects a random sequence of output electrodes and routes it to the first output channel, while the remaining unselected electrodes are routed to the second output channel, which is connected to the ground port.

- **Peak Analysis Accuracy:**
  - The accuracy of the bio-sensor was evaluated by comparing the empirically detected peaks with the estimated elements passing through the microfluidic channel. We diluted the 7.8 μm and 3.58 μm beads with PBS, a commonly used biological buffer, at different concentrations to evaluate the empirical peak detection.
  - Four samples of each concentration were collected, and the bead count data was taken from the first five minutes of each sample. Figures 12 and 13 show the correlation between the empirical peak detection and the estimated peak counts for 7.8 μm and 3.58 μm synthetic beads. The empirical peak detection varies linearly with the estimated peaks at different concentrations.
  - The differences in bead counts can be attributed to several factors, such as beads sinking to the bottom of the inlet well and being adsorbed to the microfluidic channel walls. These issues can be resolved with optimization of channel material and surface chemistry, which was beyond the scope of the current work.

- **Performance Comparison:**
  - Figure 14 compares the performance of the peak detection algorithm when run on a standard computer system (possibly a cloud virtual machine) and on a smartphone device. A standard system provides much better performance than a mobile device, especially as the sample size grows larger. The enhanced computing power of a cloud-based service motivates its use for handling peak detection and post-processing, rather than relying on the smartphone. For smaller samples, however, MedSen can be configured to perform the peak counting signal processing locally on the smartphone.
