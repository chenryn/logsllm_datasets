**Deployment Strategy for Binary Assets (SWF Files)**

I am working with a set of binary assets (SWF files), each approximately 150KB in size, and I am developing these locally on my home computer. I need to periodically deploy these files for review. My current deployment process involves the following steps:

1. Copy the SWF files into a transfer directory, which is also a Mercurial (hg) repository.
2. Push the changes to my Slicehost VPS using `hg push`.
3. SSH into my Slicehost VPS.
4. Navigate to the transfer directory and update the repository with `hg up`.
5. Switch to the `www` user with `su www` and copy the updated files to the public folder for viewing.

I would like to automate this process. Ideally, I would like to achieve the following:

1. Copy the SWF files into a "quick deploy" directory.
2. Run a single local script to handle all the above steps.

### Key Considerations

1. **Password Management**: I need to switch to the `www` user to transfer files to the public web directories. I am seeking advice on how to securely manage passwords or credentials in this context.
2. **Division of Responsibility**: I need guidance on how to best divide the responsibilities between my local machine and the server.

### Proposed Solution

I believe using `rsync` might be a better tool for this task, as I do not require a revision history for these types of changes. I can write the automation script in Python, a shell script, or any other method that is considered a best practice.

### Long-Term Goals

Eventually, I would like to build this into a system that can handle my modest deployment needs. I am open to using an open-source deployment system that can handle this and other types of scenarios. For now, I will likely create a custom solution, but I am interested in a flexible, long-term solution.

### System Details

- **Local Development Environment**: macOS
- **Target Server**: Recent flavor of Ubuntu
- **Preferred Language**: Python, but I am open to shell scripts if they are more appropriate.

### Potential Solutions

To avoid using `su www`, I see two viable options:

1. **Writable Directory**:
   - Create a directory that is writable by my user and readable by the `www` group. Ensure that the web server can serve files from this directory. Use `rsync` to synchronize files to this directory from my local machine.

2. **SSH Key Authentication**:
   - Add my public SSH key to the `www` user's `authorized_keys` file. This allows me to use `rsync` to directly transfer files to the `www` user's directory. This approach is generally more convenient and only slightly less secure in some setups.

Using a password file for `su www` is less secure and not recommended.

### Script Example

A simple script to invoke `rsync` could be written in Python. Here is a basic example:

```python
import subprocess

def rsync_files(local_path, remote_user, remote_host, remote_path):
    command = f"rsync -avz --partial {local_path} {remote_user}@{remote_host}:{remote_path}"
    subprocess.run(command, shell=True, check=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    local_path = "/path/to/local/quick_deploy"
    remote_user = "www"
    remote_host = "your.slicehost.vps"
    remote_path = "/path/to/remote/public_directory"
    
    rsync_files(local_path, remote_user, remote_host, remote_path)
```

This script can be run locally to automate the deployment process.
