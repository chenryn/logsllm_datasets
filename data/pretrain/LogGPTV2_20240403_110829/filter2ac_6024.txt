**ATT&CK ID:** M0930  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Segmentation

**Description:**
Network segmentation is a security practice that involves dividing a network into distinct, isolated segments. This technique can be used to restrict access to specific infrastructure components, thereby limiting the potential impact of an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attack. By isolating critical systems and data, network segmentation can significantly reduce the scope of AiTM activity, making it more difficult for attackers to move laterally within the network and access sensitive information.
