Abstract. Recommendersystems(RSs)havebeenadoptedinavariety
set of web services to provide a list of items which a user may inter-
act with in near future. Collaborative filtering (CF) is one of the most
widelyusedmechanisminRSsthatfocusesonpreferencesofneighbours
of similar users. Therefore, it is a critical challenge for CF models to
discover a set of appropriate neighbors for a particular user. Most of
the current approaches exploit users’ ratings information to find similar
usersbycomparingtheirratingpatterns.However,thismaybeasimple
idea and over-tested by the current studies, which may fail under data
sparsityproblem.Recommendersystemasanintelligentsystemneedsto
help users with their decision making process, and facilitate them with
personalizedsuggestions.Inrealworld,peoplearewillingtosharesimilar
interestwiththosewhohavethesamepersonalitytype;andthenamong
all similar personality users pope may only take advice and recommen-
dation from the trustworthy ones. Therefore, in this paper we propose
atwo-levelmodel, TAP,whichanalyzesusers’behaviourstofirstdetect
their personality types, and then incorporate trust information to pro-
vide more customized recommendations. We mathematically model our
approach based on the matrix factorization to consider personality and
trust information simultaneously. Experimental results on a real-world
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

1 Introduction
In the last two decades, we have witnessed the emerging growth of the gener-
ated information by people’s daily activities (e.g., browsing, clicking, listening
to music, and purchasing items). Due to this information explosion, people are
surrounded by too many options and services. In this regard, RSs can help cus-
tomers with their daily living activities from eating, and deciding on clothes to
housingandtraveling,andtoalleviatetheinformationoverloadproblem.Tradi-
tionally, Recommender Systems have been recognized as playlist generators for

video/music services (e.g., Netflix1 and Spotify2), e-commerce product recom-
menders(e.g.,Amazon3 andeBay4),orsocialcontentrecommenders(e.g.,Face-
book5 and Twitter6). Today, almost every organization leverage recommender
systems for better building their users’ profile and make a personalized sugges-
tion, accordingly.
ModelsinRSscanbemainlyclassifiedintothreemajorclassesofapproaches:
(i) content-based RS: which uses the past preferred items’ descriptions for rec-
ommendationprocess;ii)collaborativeFiltering:theylookinlike-mindedpeople
topredictusers’preferences;andiii)Hybrid:theycombinesomeoftheprevious
methods in a single model. Among all techniques in recommender systems, Col-
laborativeFiltering(CF)hasbeentakenlotsofattentionfromresearchcommu-
nity [50]. The main idea behind CF is that people with similar preference will
share similar items, and usually most of the CF approaches exploit user-item
interaction matrix to discover similar users [49]. The rating matrix records pre-
viouslyobserveditemsinwhichusersexplicitlyexpresstheirinterestsbyprovid-
ing ratings to different items. However, there may be too simplistic assumption
that if two users have the same ratings pattern, they are similar to each other.
Moreimportantly,thesemodelsmayfailunderdatasparsityproblem(i.e.,when
there is a lack of available information).
Personality as a domain-independent factor which a person tends to show
regardless of her situation has inspired researchers to use this factor into their
model. Personality has a strong correlation with individuals’ interests and
people with similar personality types tend to share similar interests. Due to
these benefit of personality, researchers start to exploit personality into their
model. Incorporating personality characteristics into RSs to not only help users
with a diverse set of items [37], but also provide a better group recommenda-
tion [42] and improve the accuracy of RSs in Music, Movies, e-learning and web
searches [24,40]. Although incorporating personality factor may help at find-
ing a set of similar neighbours for a target user, not all of similar personality
typeneighboursaretrustworthy.Inreal-worldscenariospeopleusuallyasktheir
friends when they are looking for an item (e.g., movie, music, and products),
because they have similar preference. But, a particular friend may not be reli-
able for suggesting items, and thus user’s trustworthiness plays an important
role in recommendations. Based on this observation, a good recommender sys-
tem not only should take personality as an important individuals’ feature, but
also their trustworthiness is another critical parameter which needs to be taken
inintoaccount.Todoso,weproposeanovelrecommendersysteminwhichper-
sonality and trust are considered as the main parameters for neighbours selec-
tion. We detect users’ personality type implicitly by analyzing their written

comments/reviews with no extra burden on users. Then, the trustworthy users
will be found by looking into their social context factors supported by theories
from social psychology. At the end, we propose a novel mathematical model
which integrates personality and trust information. The unique contributions of
this paper are:
– We propose a novel Recommender System called TAP, integrating two main
factors which may affect a user’s decision making process, users’ personality
types, and the trust information.
– Wedetectusers’personalitytypeimplicitlywithnoneedtousers’effortsand
through analyzing their online-generated contents.
– We calculate trust values by using social context factors inspired by psycho-
logical theories such as Social Penetration Theory.
– We conduct a comprehensive experiment on a real-world dataset to demon-
strate the superiority of TAP compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.

In this section, first we give an introduction of personality and trust, next we
discuss personality-aware RSs, and trust-aware RSs.
2.1 What is Personality?
Personality is described as “consistent behavior pattern and interpersonal pro-
cessesoriginatingwithintheindividual”[10],whichcanexplainthewidevariety
of human behavior. From the psychology point of view, personality is an impor-
tantfactorwhichisabletoexplain“patternsofthought,emotion,andbehavior”
[12]. Personality as a stable behavioral pattern plays an important role in peo-
ple’s decisions making process [39], which similar personality type people tend
to share similar taste. According to the Rentfrow et al., [41] “reflective” person-
ality type people with high openness really like to listen to the jazz, blues and
classical music, while “energetic” people with high degree of extraversion and
agreeableness usually prefer rap, hip-hop, funk and electronic music. There are
severalpersonalitytraitsmodelswhichcanexplainhumanbehaviors,andamong
them, Five Factor Model(FFM) or Big Five Model has drawn more attention
bothinpsychologyandcomputerscienceresearch.FFMmodelis“thedominant
paradigm in personality research, and one of the most influential models in all
of the psychology” [47]. Based on the FFM, people’s personality types can be
categorizedintofivemaintraitswhichisbrieflycalledOCEAN[36]:Opennessto
Experience, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
2.2 Personality Acquisition
The main issue that personality-based RSs are confronted with is how to iden-
tify user’s personality type. Basically, there are two different ways which can be

can be grouped into: Explicit techniques (filling a questionnaire questionnaires
accordingtothechosenmodel);andImplicittechniques(observingusers’behav-
ioral patterns and then proposed a regression/classification model). There are
several questionnaire types based on FFM model, NEO-Personality-Inventory
