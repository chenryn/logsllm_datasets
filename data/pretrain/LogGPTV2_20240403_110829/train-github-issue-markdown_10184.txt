The following code in SpringJUnit4Runner swallows the exception thrown by
context creation (if any) instead of throwing it. This means test execution is
continuing, while it should fail:
    @Override
    protected Object createTest() throws Exception {
    	final Object testInstance = super.createTest();
    	try {
    		getTestContextManager().prepareTestInstance(testInstance);
    	}
    	catch (Throwable t) {
// should throw exception instead of only creating one  
new Exception(t);  
}  
return testInstance;  
}
