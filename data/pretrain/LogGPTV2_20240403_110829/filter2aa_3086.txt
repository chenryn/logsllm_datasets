Information Classification: General
BGP
• Routing system of the Internet
• Networks (ASes) announce the IP 
prefixes they have
• Neighbors forward these 
announcements
• Everyone knows where to send 
traffic

BGP Hijacks
• No built-in security
• Just announce a prefix you do not 
own, be MitM, profit?

RPKI
• Systematic approach to BGP Security
• Certificates: Address block -> ASN
• Called Route Origin Authorization (ROA)
• Root of Trust: RIRs
• Because RIRs allocate address blocks!
• Kind of like getting your TLS cert from 
the registry

Route Origin Validation
• Now everyone has ROAs
• (actually only 34.2%)
• How to check them?
• Put them into BGP?
• Third-party system!

RPKI works!
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Attacking RPKI
• Integrity?
• Create Malicious ROA? Breaking crypto 
is hard.
• Fool the CAs? CAs are run by RIRs.
• Availability!
• RPKI is a third party system to BGP
• What if RPKI stops working?
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Making RPKI stop working
• Relying Parties (RPs) need to download 
ROAs from Publication Points (PPs)
• If download fails, RPs will not have ROAs     
and assume RPKI has not been deployed
• Plan:
• Break communication with PP
• RPs cannot fetch information
• RPKI turned off (RPKI state unknown)
• Start BGP hijack
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
RP cache and manifests
• RPs cache old data until expiry
• ROAs expire pretty slowly (1 year)
• Manifests
• Essentially a signed index
• Designed to prevent replay attacks
• ROAs not listed in manifest get removed
• Short expiry time! (1 day)
• Effectively only 6 hours of attack time because of deterministic re-generation
Manifest validity time

Information Classification: General
Breaking communication
Low-rate attack:
• Exploit rate-limiting 
on PP/NS
• Send spoofed 
requests
• Victim gets blocked
• After 6 hours: ROAs 
removed from cache 
due to expired 
manifest

Information Classification: General
Rate-limiting in RPKI
Tested rate-limiting in PPs
• DNS RRL & TCP Syn rate-limiting
• Typically implemented to 
prevent DoS
Results
• 47% of PPs do it  (limit < 10,000 pkt/s)
• Affects 60% of RPKI-protected IPv4 space
• 3% of IPv4 are protected by PPs with 
very low (<60 pkt/s) rate-limit
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Feasability (1)
So 60% of Ipv4 can be attacked?
Example:
• Rate-limit is 1,000 pkt/s,                                           
attacker sends 10,000 pkt/s
• Connection success is ~ 10%
• But RPs will retry
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Feasability (2)
Simulation using different scenarios
• Feasible for low rate-limits (< 60 pkt/s), higher 
ones are challenging due to retries in 6 hours
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
We have to try harder
• RPKI allows delegation
• LIRs can run their own Publication Point
• Attackers can run their own Publication Point
• and RPs have to contact them
• Can we exploit this to break the RP?

Slowed response
Stalloris
• Attacker becomes malicious Publication Point
• Sends responses as slow as possible
• Hinders RP from doing many retries
Simulation shows this makes attack feasible
for high rate-limits and less-favorable 
scenarios
• Becoming a PP also helps time the attack with 
spoofed queries
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Wrapping up
• Third-party system allows attacks on availability
• Rate-limiting can be exploited to block legitimate requests from off-path
• Short manifest validity makes attacks feasible
• Attackers can become PPs and prevent RPs from doing their work
#BHUSA @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
Recommendations
• Publication points
• Avoid low rate limits: Limiting to 60 pkt/s/IP is very easy to spoof
• Longer manifest validities, e.g., 1 week
• Randomize when manifests are re-generated
• More robust deployment/redundancy
• Relying parties
• Monitor connection failures
• Limit processing time/PP and limit tree size under one PP
