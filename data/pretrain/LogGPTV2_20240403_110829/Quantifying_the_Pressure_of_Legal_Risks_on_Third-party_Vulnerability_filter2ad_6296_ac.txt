### Analysis of Company Responses to Research Requests

#### 1. Categorization of Responses
We identified four main categories of responses from the companies: **Request Granted**, **Request Explicitly Rejected**, **Exchange Terminated**, and **Indeterminate**.

- **Granted (n = 15)**
  - **Positive Responses**: These ranged from matter-of-fact acceptance to enthusiastic support.
    - Example: "You are welcome to experiment on it."
    - Some companies referred to their publicly posted policies, such as bug bounty and responsible disclosure policies.
    - Many companies expressed concern that the study should not impact their systems or customers, emphasizing the importance of ethical testing.
    - A few companies saw this as a potential sales opportunity, offering discounted products for the research.
  - **Conditions Imposed**:
    - Only 13.3% of the companies granted the request without any conditions.
    - Four-fifths of the companies requested advance warning, with varying degrees of formality.
    - Four companies requested editorial control over the final report.
    - Two companies required the researcher to sign an NDA, often with detailed documentation requirements.

- **Rejected (n = 5)**
  - **Reasons for Rejection**:
    - 40% of the companies declined to participate, even though no cooperation was requested.
    - Another 40% cited internal policies and constraints.
    - One company implied that the request was too broad, citing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

- **Indeterminate (n = 10)**
  - **Unclear Outcomes**:
    - Conversations appeared productive but were dropped, and re-engagement attempts failed.
    - Common responses included promises to get back to the researcher, which did not materialize.
    - Some seemed genuinely interested but may have been overruled by superiors.

- **Terminated (n = 6)**
  - **Reasons for Termination**:
    - 83.3% of these companies requested a phone call and became unresponsive when the researcher did not arrange one.
    - Half of these companies required further clarification on testing plans and publishing, which they found unsatisfactory in written form.
    - Legal departments were particularly insistent on phone calls for detailed discussions.

#### 2. Sensitivity to Test Parameters
We analyzed the factors that influenced the type or rate of response. The following parameters were considered:

- **Researcher Type**:
  - Academic researchers received significantly more positive responses (13 out of 33 requests) compared to independent researchers (2 out of 20). This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.028).
  - Despite this, academic researchers also received all rejections, possibly due to their higher engagement rate.

- **Explicit Mention of DMCA**:
  - Mentioning the DMCA did not significantly affect the initial response rate.
  - However, it slightly reduced the likelihood of a request being granted (7 out of 29 vs. 8 out of 24) and increased the likelihood of rejection (4 out of 29 vs. 1 out of 24), though these differences were not statistically significant.

- **Company Ownership**:
  - Private companies (n = 21) were more likely to grant requests than public companies (n = 32), although the difference was not statistically significant.

- **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**:
  - Companies with a vulnerability disclosure policy (n = 18) were more likely to grant requests and less likely to reject them compared to those without such a policy (n = 35), though the difference was not statistically significant.

- **Forwards to Legal Departments**:
  - Five companies explicitly forwarded the request to their legal teams. Four of these had the DMCA mentioned. Three granted the request conditionally, one was indeterminate, and one was terminated due to a phone call request.

### Sentiment Survey of Security Researchers

#### 1. Survey Methodology
- **Participants**: We collected participants from publicly available archives of vulnerability-related mailing lists, ensuring they were engaged in vulnerability research.
- **Survey Design**:
  - The survey included questions to gauge the perceived and real risks of legal action.
  - Participants were asked about their experiences with legal threats and the impact of legal concerns on their research.

#### 2. Survey Results
- **Relative Influence of Legal Risks**:
  - Participants were 1.5 times more likely to strongly agree that legal challenges deterred their research compared to other factors (p = 0.034).
  - For 14% of participants, the tracking question was the only one they strongly agreed with.

- **Past Fear of Legal Risks**:
  - Participants were asked if they had ever feared legal action and if this fear prevented or modified their research projects.
  - Those who answered yes were given the opportunity to provide more details.

- **Experiences of Legal Threats and Action**:
  - Participants were asked if they had ever been threatened with legal action or sued due to their research.
  - Those who answered yes could describe their experiences.

#### 3. Response Summary
- **Participation Rate**:
  - Of the 1,369 individuals invited, 158 (11.5%) visited the survey page, and 139 (88%) self-reported as vulnerability researchers.
  - After removing incomplete responses, 110 respondents were included in the final analysis.

- **Key Findings**:
  - Legal challenges were a significant deterrent, with a statistically significant difference in the responses.
  - The tracking variable produced a more polarized response, with more participants strongly agreeing or disagreeing.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the factors influencing company responses to security research requests and the impact of legal risks on security researchers.
