User: I have just started with Python. When I execute a python script file on Windows, the output window appears but instantaneously goes away. I need it to stay there so I can analyze my output. How can I keep it open?
Assistant: I had a similar problem. With Notepad++ I used to use the command : C:\Python27\python.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" which closed the cmd window immediately after the code terminated.
Now I am using cmd /k c:\Python27\python.exe "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)" which keeps the cmd window open.
