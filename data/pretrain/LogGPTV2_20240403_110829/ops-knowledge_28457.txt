User: How to start and manage systemd services on Linux? Please provide specific commands and steps.
Assistant: 1. Start the systemd service: Use the command 'systemctl start <service name>' to start the service. For example, start the nginx service: 'systemctl start nginx' 2. Stop the systemd service: Use the command 'systemctl stop <service name>' to stop the service. For example, stop the nginx service: 'systemctl stop nginx' 3. Restart the systemd service: Use the command 'systemctl restart <service name>' to restart the service. For example, restart the nginx service: 'systemctl restart nginx' 4. Reload the systemd service: use the command 'systemctl reload <service name>' to reload the service. For example, reload the nginx service: 'systemctl reload nginx' Reloading the service allows the service to re-read the configuration file without having to stop and restart the service. 5. View systemd service status: Use the command 'systemctl status <service name>' to view the service status. For example, to view the nginx service status: 'systemctl status nginx' This command will tell you if the service is running, which process is running the service, the service's logs and other useful information. 6. Enable the service when the system boots: Use the command 'systemctl enable <service name>' to enable the service to start automatically when the system boots. For example, enable the nginx service: 'systemctl enable nginx' 7. Disable the service when the system boots: Use the command 'systemctl disable <service name>' to disable the service from automatically starting when the system boots. For example, disable the nginx service: 'systemctl disable nginx' 8. View the list of started services: Use the command 'systemctl list-unit-files --type=service' to view the list of all services. This command will list the filenames of all services and whether they are enabled and running.
