User: How to design and implement an efficient data caching system? Consider issues such as cache policy, cache coherence, cache punctures, and passthrough.
Assistant: The data caching system is a very important system, which can improve the performance of the system and reduce the load on the database. To design and implement an efficient data caching system, the following issues need to be considered: 1. Caching strategy: Choosing an appropriate caching strategy can improve the cache hit rate and reduce the impact of cache failure. There are various caching strategies to choose from, such as first in first out (FIFO), least recently used (LRU), approximate least recently used (ARC), etc. 2. Cache consistency: The cache system needs to ensure the consistency of read and write data, that is, the data in the cache must be consistent with the data in the database. In order to ensure consistency, mechanisms such as read-write locks and distributed locks can be used to ensure data consistency in multi-threaded, multi-process, multi-node, etc. situations. 3. Cache breakdown: When the required data does not exist in the cache, the database is queried every time, causing the cache that could reduce the pressure on the database to become a "shield"; one way to solve the problem of cache breakdown is to use mutual exclusion Lock, only one thread queries the database, and other threads must wait for the query to complete before accessing the cache. 4. Cache penetration: The concern is that the requested data does not exist in the database, nor does the cache layer, and each request will directly access the database. The solution to cache penetration is to cache null values, that is, a null value is also stored in the cache, so that when requesting data that does not exist, the null value can be obtained from the cache and cached for a period of time to avoid Every request hits the database directly. To sum up, designing and implementing an efficient data caching system requires comprehensive consideration of caching strategies, cache consistency, cache breakdown, and cache penetration. In addition, you need to pay attention to the cache size and cleaning strategy to avoid system crashes caused by the cache occupying too much memory.
