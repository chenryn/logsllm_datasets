User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题AWS elastic load balancer basic issues I have an array of EC2 t1.micro instances behind a load balancer and each node can manage ~100 concurrent users before it starts to get wonky.

i would THINK if i have 2 such instances it would allow my network to manage 200 concurrent users... apparently not.  When i really slam the server (blitz.io) with a full 275 concurrents, it behaves the same as if there is just one node.  it goes from 400ms response time to 1.6 seconds (which for a single t1.micro is expected, but not 6).

So the question is, am i simply not doing something right or is ELB effectively worthless?  Anyone have some wisdom on this?

Assistant: Micro instances are not designed for sustained load. They allow bursting CPU, but after a short period of time (think 15-30 seconds) at heavy load they will be severely capped.

Try it with a small instance, at least, if you want any sort of useful benchmark.
