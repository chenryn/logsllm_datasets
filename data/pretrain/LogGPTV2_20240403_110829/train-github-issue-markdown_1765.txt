As seen in this Jupyter notebook (in HTML format) \- (gist of the HTML here),
using `FacetGrid` and `seaborn.boxplot` may produce incorrect/incomplete
outputs.
This problem appears primarily when data has gaps or missing values, the
target column is used for `FacetGrid(row=...)` and the dtype of said column is
`object`. The problem is gone when columns are converted to `category`.
Detailed examples on the linked HTML document.
