SNR (required for decoding 5G-NR OFDM signals). Therefore, a
multi-beam link is resilient to outages because it avoids a single point
of failure.
‚ñ† Accurate per-beam power estimation: We now test our
multi-beam link under mobility. We set up a multi-beam with two
beams at the transmitter and rotate the transmit phased array us-
ing our gantry. We then collect the channel estimates with our
Omni-directional receiver and estimate per-beam power using our
super-resolution algorithm. We plot the per-beam power of the
two beams in multi-beam with ground truth angle in Fig. 14(a). We
observe that per-beam power reduces with the angle of rotation and
follows the beam pattern. We observe perturbations in power values
due to measurement noise, which may affect tracking performance.
To improve tracking accuracy, mmReliable takes time average of
power values with a forgetting factor & fits a quadratic polyno-
mial to smooth the data. With proper scaling, the curve fitting
approximates the beam pattern within 1 dB mean error (Fig. 14(a)).
‚ñ† Accurate rotation angle estimation: We next evaluate the
performance of our tracking algorithm. We perform multiple ex-
periments with a uniform rotation of the transmitter array. The
frequency of rotation is varied over a range of 2o to 8o, and the
average angle estimated by our algorithm is reported in Fig. 14(a).
The mean angle estimate is accurate to 1o for tracking both LOS &
the NLOS link when compared against ground truth.
‚ñ† Tracking accuracy time series: Accurate angle estimation
by mmReliable‚Äôs proactive tracking algorithm helps maintain a
high throughput link under user mobility. Figure 14(c) shows the
throughput of our multi-beam links for a uniform translation of 1
sec duration (at 1.5 m/s speed) under three situations. First, we show
that the link throughput degrades from 600 Mbps to ‚àº 100 Mbps
below our outage threshold if no tracking is performed. In contrast,
multi-beam tracking with constructive combining (CC) approach
maintains a consistently high throughput 1-sec of user mobility.
Finally, if we perform tracking alone, without doing constructive
combining optimization, the throughput improvements are lower
by an average of 100 Mbps compared to the case of tracking plus
CC. Thus, mmReliable provides consistently high throughput due to
its super-resolution, per-beam tracking, & constructive combining
algorithms.
6.2 End-to-end Results
We present end-to-end results for mmReliable and compare the
performance against other baselines [11, 12, 73].

pared to a single beam.
dB, which motivates the need for constructive multi-beam. It also
indicates that mmReliable‚Äôs two-probe method accurately estimates
the phase of 2.5 radians, which maximizes the SNR. Similarly, we
perform an exhaustive scan of the second beam‚Äôs relative amplitude
in the range of [‚àí10, 2] dB and show the SNR variations in Fig. 12(b).
It indicates that the SNR is highest for a range of amplitude around -
5 dB to -3 dB. Therefore our estimate of -3.8 dB using the two-probe
method is reasonably accurate. Finally, we show the per-beam
phase‚Äôs stability over the 100 MHz frequency range in Fig. 12(c).
We observe that phase variation is less than 1 rad, which doesn‚Äôt
impact the SNR gain of our multi-beam system.
‚ñ† SNR gain due to constructive multi-beam: We now verify
that constructive multi-beam leads to higher SNR than a single beam
system, even for a static unblocked link. We reuse our previous
set-up and measure that our two-beam multi-beam link provides
1.04 dB SNR improvement on average compared to a single beam
oriented towards the LOS path (Fig. 12(d)). The SNR gain is achieved
by constructively combining the signal along the two-channel paths.
To understand how many beams are required in a multi-beam, we
establish an oracle channel-dependent beam that uses the chan-
nel at each antenna element of the phased array. Obtaining this
oracle beam requires an extensive measurement process with a
high overhead [14]. This oracle beam provides an SNR gain of 2.5
dB w.r.t. single beam. We show that our multi-beam pattern with
only three beams (utilizing the three most strong channel paths)
provides a 2.27 dB gain w.r.t. single beam, which performs similarly
to the oracle beam. This analysis indicates that 3-beams are enough
to achieve within 92% of the optimal beam with significantly less
overhead.
‚ñ† Static link with blockages: To study the impact of blockage on
a multi-beam link, one of the authors walks across our established
link multiple times with a consistent walking speed. From Fig. 13,
we observe that our multi-beam link with two beams is blocked
twice as the blocker passes both the NLOS and LOS link. However,
even for the LOS link blockage, the SNR reduction is only 7 dB,

‚ñ† Multi-beam performance for static link: We first show that
mmReliable with constructive multi-beam and proactive response
to blockages can beat other single-beam-based baselines for static
links. For this, we implement mmReliable without the user tracking
algorithm. We also implement two baselines; (i) BeamSpy [12]
which detects link blockage by exploiting spatial channel profiles
to find the alternate unblocked link without extensive training.
(ii) Reactive baseline [11], which implements a fast beam training
in response to the blockage event. Both baselines are based on
a single beam, and they suffer from a single point of failure to
link blockage and act after an outage is detected. We see from Fig.
15(a) that mmReliable outperforms both baselines and provides a
high throughput mmWave link even under the impact of blockage.
mmReliable‚Äôs throughput drops only by 4% even when there are
two blockers near the beams because of the proactive utilization
of reflectors. Since BeamSpy [12] was designed for 60 GHz links,
we show that mmReliable beats BeamSpy even for 60GHz links in
Appendix B.
‚ñ† Improvement in Reliability for mobile links: We perform
user translation and rotation experiments in multiple indoor and
outdoor environments. As the user moves, a human blocker is in-
troduced midway between gNB and UE, blocking the link for a
duration chosen uniformly between 100 ms to 500 ms [5], over
1-sec experiments. We perform 100 such experiments and combine
the results to form one point, and various user mobility and block-
age patterns across two indoor environments are reported on the
throughput and reliability curve. Fig. 15(b) shows that mmReliable
achieves close to 100% reliability (median value 1). The reactive
baseline suffers from lower reliability of median value 0.65, while
the widebeam baseline is at 0.5. Thus, mmReliable achieves its goal
of high reliability.
‚ñ† Throughput-Reliability Trade-off: We introduce a new method
to evaluate mmWave systems by interpreting the data from the last
sub-section using both reliability and throughput metrics. Using
both metrics allows us to compare mmReliable with other baselines
to assess the throughput-reliability tradeoff in Fig. 15(c). Across all
experiments, mmReliable is not significantly affected by throughput
loss, while the other benchmarks show degradation due to blockage
and user mobility. The results indicate that mmReliable delivers an
average throughput improvement of 50% over the reactive base-
line (200 Mbps improvement over 400 Mbps). More importantly,
mmReliable offers a consistent throughput with low variations
compared to the baselines, essential to many mission-critical ap-
plications. The evaluation reveals that mmReliable is advantageous
over throughput-based design on both throughput & reliability.
‚ñ† Beam probing overhead: mmReliable reduces the beam prob-
ing overhead by maintaining a multi-beam link through tracking
and beam refinements. The proposed beam refinement procedure
requires three CSI-RS probes for two-beam case: two for estimating
ùõø, ùúé and one probe for detecting the direction of motion. For the
3-beam case, it only increases to 5 probes. On the other hand, an
entire beam scan using SSB in traditional 5G NR requires a large
number of SSB probes proportional to the number of spatial di-
rections. One CSI-RS occupies one slot, which is 0.125 ms at 120
kHz sub-carrier spacing, and one SSB takes four slots (0.5 ms). Let‚Äôs
consider the best scanning method, which requires the number of
probes proportional to only a logarithmic number of antennas [11].
We show in Fig. 15(d) that traditional 5G NR suffers from higher

probing overhead compared to mmReliable. The 5G NR probing
overhead for eight antennas base station is 3 ms, which increases
to 6 ms for 64 antennas (because of the high directionality of beam
patterns). In contrast, the overhead of mmReliable remains as low
as 0.4 ms for 2-beam & 0.6 ms for 3-beam cases independent of
the number of antennas. Thus, mmReliable is an efficient solution
for beam management, which improves mmWave link reliability &
throughput while maintaining low system overhead.
7 Related Work
mmReliable is closely related to extensive work in mmWave com-
munication literature, therefore we have grouped the past work
into following categories.
‚ñ† Channel-dependent or multi-beamforming: Multi-beam
patterns belong to the family of channel-dependent beamform-
ing [14, 41] where the beamforming weights are obtained to max-
imize the SNR for a given channel condition. For instance, [41]
showed through channel-sounding measurements that combining
multiple signals across four directions could achieve 28 dB improve-
ment in path-loss at 28 GHz; however, they require multiple phased
arrays. Traditionally these optimizations are proposed for a MIMO
system that uses channel measurements at each antenna [74‚Äì76]
for digital beamforming. In contrast, mmReliable focuses on analog
beamforming where the signal from each antenna element is con-
nected through a single RF chain. ACO [14] proposed a procedure
to estimate per-antenna CSI for analog array by designing a specific
beam scan procedure.
However, all work in this field incurs high overhead propor-
tional to the number of antennas and cannot be repeated often as
the channel changes. In contrast, we propose a multi-beam that ap-
proximates the optimal beam pattern and is easy to maintain with
low overhead. A similar system [34] proposes constructive multi-
beam for communication that focuses solely on beam-training and
multi-beam creation. Specifically, it does not describe any beam-
maintenance scheme and therefore would incur high overheads and
be unreliable in practice. mmReliable is the first system that enables
multi-beam constructive combining with low-complexity beam
training and continued beam maintenance, mitigating blockage
and mobility effects.
‚ñ† Blockage and mobility: BeamSpy [12] and Beam-forecast [13]
provide a model-driven approach to handle blockage and mobility,
respectively. However, they suffer from high run-time optimization
and table-lookup complexity. To recover from a complete outage,
UBig [77] performs efficient handovers, and mmChoir [78] proposes
joint transmission from multiple base stations. These approaches
may improve system reliability but add additional signaling over-
head. Location estimation using extensive beam training from single
or multiple gNBs are proposed in [73, 79‚Äì82]. In contrast, mmReli-
able performs tracking of the user without any training overhead.
[58] developed a mechanism to detect the direction of user move-
ment and adjust beam direction in small increments. Though they
use a 2-lobe pattern to detect mobility, they switch back to a single-
beam pattern for communication. The fundamental difference is
they use a single beam and are generally reactive.
‚ñ† Beam Training: A vast literature focus on reducing the ini-
tial beam training delay through single-beam [7‚Äì9, 19, 20, 20] or
multi-beams [10, 11, 34, 35, 83]. In contrast, mmReliable focuses on
link maintenance and reliability and therefore is complementary to
initial beam training approaches. High training overhead may be re-
duced by taking assistance from device positioning systems [24, 25]
or light sensors [23], out-of-band WiFi [21, 22], and multi-user co-
ordination techniques [84, 85]. However, in contrast to mmReliable,
they suffer from relatively lower accuracy with added complexity
while dependent on external devices. mmReliable high accuracy is
achieved based on the super-resolution algorithm combined with
the motion tracking algorithm.
‚ñ† Reflecting surfaces: Prior work on active mmWave relay [86,
87] requires additional active devices (antenna array) with beam-
forming capabilities to relay the signal towards the user. These
devices increase cost and power consumption. On the other hand,
mmReliable relies entirely on natural reflectors present in the en-
vironment. The authors of [17, 18, 71, 88‚Äì91] leverage reflective
surfaces to improve indoor mmWave connectivity & coverage. Their
model is suitable for one-time sensing for initial network deploy-
ment, which complements our goal of improving the link reliability
in real-time.
8 Discussion and Future Work
Since multi-beams are a new class of beamforming, designing a
robust networking system while multiplexing users is an open
challenge. We discuss some limitations of mmReliable and identify
possible future research directions.
Strong reflectors: The functioning of mmReliable depends on the
availability of strong reflectors in the environment, otherwise, the
multi-beam system falls back to a single-beam system. We envision
future deployments where intelligent reflecting surfaces [47, 86, 87,
92] are deployed in the environment to engineer strong reflections
that improve the throughput and reliability of mmWave links.
Tracking re-calibration: While we can track the angle of move-
ment of both direct and reflected paths using super-resolution and
tracking algorithms, the tracking of reflected paths would be af-
fected when the path is blocked, or the reflector vanishes. mmRe-
liable detects such cases by observing per-beam power and real-
