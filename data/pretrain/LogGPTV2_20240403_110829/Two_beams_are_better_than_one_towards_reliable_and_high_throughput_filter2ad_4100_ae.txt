### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Multi-Beam Link Resilience
A high SNR is essential for decoding 5G-NR OFDM signals. A multi-beam link enhances resilience to outages by avoiding a single point of failure.

### Accurate Per-Beam Power Estimation
To test the multi-beam link under mobility, we set up a system with two beams at the transmitter and rotate the phased array using a gantry. We then collect channel estimates using an omnidirectional receiver and estimate per-beam power with a super-resolution algorithm. The per-beam power of the two beams, plotted against the ground truth angle in Figure 14(a), shows that power decreases with the angle of rotation, following the beam pattern. Measurement noise introduces perturbations in power values, which can affect tracking performance. To mitigate this, mmReliable applies a time average with a forgetting factor and fits a quadratic polynomial to smooth the data. This process approximates the beam pattern within a 1 dB mean error (Figure 14(a)).

### Accurate Rotation Angle Estimation
Next, we evaluate the performance of our tracking algorithm through multiple experiments with uniform rotation of the transmitter array. The rotation frequency ranges from 2° to 8°, and the estimated average angle is reported in Figure 14(a). The mean angle estimate is accurate to within 1° for both Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) links compared to the ground truth.

### Tracking Accuracy Time Series
Accurate angle estimation by mmReliable’s proactive tracking algorithm helps maintain high throughput under user mobility. Figure 14(c) shows the throughput of our multi-beam links during a uniform translation of 1 second duration (at 1.5 m/s speed) under three scenarios:
1. Without tracking, the link throughput degrades from 600 Mbps to approximately 100 Mbps below the outage threshold.
2. With multi-beam tracking and constructive combining (CC), the throughput remains consistently high during the 1-second user mobility.
3. If tracking is performed without CC optimization, the throughput improvements are lower by an average of 100 Mbps compared to the case with both tracking and CC. Thus, mmReliable provides consistently high throughput due to its super-resolution, per-beam tracking, and constructive combining algorithms.

### End-to-End Results
We present end-to-end results for mmReliable and compare its performance against other baselines [11, 12, 73].

**Figure 13: Multi-Beam Reliability and Blockage Resilience**
- Multi-beam systems are more reliable and blockage-resilient compared to single-beam systems. The SNR gain motivates the use of constructive multi-beam. Our two-probe method accurately estimates the phase of 2.5 radians, maximizing the SNR. An exhaustive scan of the second beam’s relative amplitude in the range of [−10, 2] dB shows the highest SNR for amplitudes around -5 dB to -3 dB. The per-beam phase stability over the 100 MHz frequency range indicates a phase variation of less than 1 rad, which does not impact the SNR gain.

**Figure 12: SNR Gain Due to Constructive Multi-Beam**
- Constructive multi-beam leads to higher SNR than a single-beam system, even for static unblocked links. Our two-beam multi-beam link provides an average SNR improvement of 1.04 dB compared to a single beam oriented towards the LOS path (Figure 12(d)). The SNR gain is achieved by constructively combining the signal along the two-channel paths. An oracle channel-dependent beam, which uses the channel at each antenna element, provides an SNR gain of 2.5 dB. Our multi-beam pattern with only three beams (utilizing the three strongest channel paths) provides a 2.27 dB gain, performing similarly to the oracle beam. This analysis indicates that three beams are sufficient to achieve 92% of the optimal beam with significantly less overhead.

**Figure 13: Static Link with Blockages**
- To study the impact of blockage on a multi-beam link, one of the authors walks across the established link multiple times at a consistent speed. From Figure 13, we observe that the multi-beam link with two beams is blocked twice as the blocker passes both the NLOS and LOS links. However, even for the LOS link blockage, the SNR reduction is only 7 dB.

### Multi-Beam Performance for Static Links
mmReliable with constructive multi-beam and proactive response to blockages outperforms single-beam-based baselines for static links. We implement mmReliable without the user tracking algorithm and compare it with two baselines: BeamSpy [12] and a reactive baseline [11]. Both baselines suffer from a single point of failure and act after an outage is detected. Figure 15(a) shows that mmReliable outperforms both baselines, providing high throughput even under blockage. The throughput drops only by 4% when there are two blockers near the beams due to proactive utilization of reflectors.

### Improvement in Reliability for Mobile Links
We perform user translation and rotation experiments in various indoor and outdoor environments. As the user moves, a human blocker is introduced, blocking the link for a duration chosen uniformly between 100 ms to 500 ms over 1-second experiments. Figure 15(b) shows that mmReliable achieves close to 100% reliability (median value 1), while the reactive baseline has a median value of 0.65 and the widebeam baseline is at 0.5. Thus, mmReliable achieves high reliability.

### Throughput-Reliability Trade-off
We introduce a new method to evaluate mmWave systems using both reliability and throughput metrics. Figure 15(c) compares mmReliable with other baselines, showing that mmReliable delivers an average throughput improvement of 50% over the reactive baseline (200 Mbps improvement over 400 Mbps). More importantly, mmReliable offers consistent throughput with low variations, essential for mission-critical applications.

### Beam Probing Overhead
mmReliable reduces beam probing overhead by maintaining a multi-beam link through tracking and beam refinements. For a two-beam case, three CSI-RS probes are required: two for estimating δ, σ, and one for detecting the direction of motion. For the three-beam case, it increases to five probes. In contrast, traditional 5G NR requires a large number of SSB probes proportional to the number of spatial directions. Figure 15(d) shows that traditional 5G NR suffers from higher probing overhead compared to mmReliable. For eight antennas, 5G NR probing overhead is 3 ms, increasing to 6 ms for 64 antennas. mmReliable's overhead remains as low as 0.4 ms for two beams and 0.6 ms for three beams, independent of the number of antennas.

### Related Work
mmReliable is closely related to extensive work in mmWave communication literature, grouped into the following categories:

**Channel-Dependent or Multi-Beamforming**
- Multi-beam patterns belong to the family of channel-dependent beamforming [14, 41], where beamforming weights maximize SNR for given channel conditions. Traditional optimizations for MIMO systems use channel measurements at each antenna [74–76] for digital beamforming. mmReliable focuses on analog beamforming, where the signal from each antenna element is connected through a single RF chain. ACO [14] proposed a procedure to estimate per-antenna CSI for analog arrays, but all such work incurs high overhead. mmReliable proposes a multi-beam that approximates the optimal beam pattern with low overhead.

**Blockage and Mobility**
- BeamSpy [12] and Beam-forecast [13] provide model-driven approaches to handle blockage and mobility but suffer from high run-time optimization and table-lookup complexity. UBig [77] performs efficient handovers, and mmChoir [78] proposes joint transmission from multiple base stations. These approaches add additional signaling overhead. mmReliable performs tracking without training overhead.

**Beam Training**
- Literature focuses on reducing initial beam training delay through single-beam or multi-beams. mmReliable focuses on link maintenance and reliability, complementary to initial beam training approaches. High training overhead can be reduced by using device positioning systems, light sensors, out-of-band WiFi, and multi-user coordination techniques, but these methods have lower accuracy and added complexity.

**Reflecting Surfaces**
- Prior work on active mmWave relays [86, 87] requires additional active devices, increasing cost and power consumption. mmReliable relies on natural reflectors in the environment. Other work [17, 18, 71, 88–91] leverages reflective surfaces to improve indoor mmWave connectivity and coverage, complementing our goal of real-time link reliability.

### Discussion and Future Work
Designing a robust networking system while multiplexing users with multi-beams is an open challenge. Some limitations of mmReliable and future research directions include:

**Strong Reflectors**
- mmReliable depends on strong reflectors in the environment; otherwise, it falls back to a single-beam system. Future deployments could use intelligent reflecting surfaces to engineer strong reflections, improving throughput and reliability.

**Tracking Re-calibration**
- While mmReliable can track the angle of movement of both direct and reflected paths, tracking of reflected paths is affected when the path is blocked or the reflector vanishes. mmReliable detects such cases by observing per-beam power and re-calibrating the tracking.
