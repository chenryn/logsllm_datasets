User: How to check memory usage and resource consumption on a Linux server?
Assistant: There are many ways to check the memory usage and resource consumption on a Linux server, the following are some of the commonly used methods: 1. Use the top command: Enter the top command in the terminal to instantly display the system resource usage, including CPU usage, memory Occupancy rate, number of processes and other information. 2. Use the free command: The free command can display information such as the total memory, used memory, and available memory of the system, and can also display the usage of the swap partition (swap). 3. Use the ps command: The ps command can display the running processes in the current system, and sort them according to indicators such as CPU occupancy rate and memory occupancy rate. 4. Use the vmstat command: The vmstat command can display the system's virtual memory, process, IO and other information, and can also monitor the changes of system resources in real time. 5. Use the sar command: The sar command can count the historical usage of system resources, including CPU usage, memory usage, IO and other indicators, and can output charts or reports. 6. Use the htop tool: htop is an alternative tool to top, which can display the usage of system resources in real time, and can use the mouse for interactive operation, which is more convenient to use. No matter which method you use, you should choose appropriate detection methods and tools based on actual needs, so as to better understand the usage of system resources and performance bottlenecks.
