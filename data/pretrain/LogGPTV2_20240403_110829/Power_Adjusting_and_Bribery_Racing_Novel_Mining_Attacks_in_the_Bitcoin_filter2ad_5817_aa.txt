ABSTRACT
Mining attacks allow attackers to gain an unfair share of the
mining reward by deviating from the honest mining strat-
egy in the Bitcoin system. Among the most well-known are
block withholding (BWH), fork after withholding (FAW),
and selfish mining. In this paper, we propose two new strate-
gies: power adjusting and bribery racing, and introduce two
novel mining attacks, Power Adjusting Withholding (PAW)
and Bribery Selfish Mining (BSM) adopting the new strate-
gies. Both attacks can increase the reward of attackers. Fur-
thermore, we show PAW can avoid the ‚Äúminer‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù
in BWH attacks. BSM introduces a new ‚Äúvenal miner‚Äôs
dilemma‚Äù, which results in all targets (bribes) willing to
help the attacker but getting less reward finally. Quantitative
analyses and simulations are conducted to verify the effec-
tiveness of our attacks. We propose some countermeasures
to mitigate the new attacks, but a practical and efficient
solution remains to be an open problem.

1 INTRODUCTION
Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency based on the blockchain
technique [20]. In the Bitcoin system, participants (miners)
can be rewarded by adding transaction records (recorded in a
new block ) to the ‚Äúledger‚Äù of past transactions (blockchain).
When adding transaction records, a proof of work (PoW)
[24] is required, which needs miners to solve cryptographic
puzzles. The first miner who solves the puzzles and generates
a valid block can be rewarded (with 12.5 bitcoins in 2019)
by the system. The process of generating blocks is known
as the ‚Äúmining process‚Äù. After that, a new round of mining
begins and miners try to generate the next block. When two
or more miners simultaneously generate and propagate their
blocks, it will cause a fork on the blockchain. To ensure the
consensus, the system will choose the firstly extended branch
(i.e., the longest branch) as the main chain. Miners on other
branches will move to the main chain when they are aware
of a longer branch.
In the Bitcoin system, the difficulty of solving crypto-
graphic puzzles is adjusted in every two weeks to ensure
the average time of the mining process in each round is a
constant (10 minutes). As the hash rate of today‚Äôs mining
power is more than 7 √ó 1019 Hash/s [26], the probability of
a solo miner discovering a block is very small. Therefore,
miners join together as mining pools to reduce the reward
variance. When a pool discovers a block, the reward will be
shared by pool miners based on their contributions (the num-
ber of submitted shares). Most of the pools have a manager
for pool management, including work allocation and reward
distribution.
Though the Bitcoin is designed with security in mind,
previous research points out attackers can increase their re-
ward of mining when deviating from honest mining strategies,
such as adopting selfish mining [9], block withholding (BWH)
[5, 37], and fork after withholding (FAW) [13]. In selfish min-
ing, an attacker withholds the discovered block and continues
mining on this block as a private chain. When other miners
find a block, the attacker selectively propagates the withheld
blocks on the private chain to cause a fork. In BWH attacks,
an attacker splits her computational power into solo mining
(innocent mining) and in-pool mining (infiltration mining).
When attacker‚Äôs infiltration mining finds a valid block (full
proof of work, FPoW), she withholds it and continues sub-
mitting other shares (partial proof of work, PPoW) which
makes her seem to contribute to the pool. Since the pool can
never be rewarded from the attacker‚Äôs infiltration mining,
the victim pool will suffer from a loss. While other miners,
including the attacker‚Äôs innocent mining, will get more re-
wards because of the loss of the victim pool. Previous study
shows BWH attacks can be more profitable than honest min-
ing when the attacker splits her power properly [5], but will
encounter a ‚Äúminer‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù when two pools use BWH
attacks against each other (both pools earn less than the
reward of honest mining) [7]. FAW attacks work similar to
BWH attacks, but the attacker will propagate the withheld
FPoW when another miner (not in the victim pool) finds a
valid block to cause an intentional fork. Since the attacker
may earn an extra reward from the fork, FAW attacks can
be more profitable than BWH attacks. Besides, the ‚Äúminer‚Äôs
dilemma‚Äù can be avoided in FAW attacks, since the larger
pool can earn an extra reward. These mining attacks can also
affect other PoW-based cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin
[31] and Dogecoin [30], and may become more powerful when
multiple coin systems are involved [14].
In this paper, we take an in-depth study of the mining
attack strategies and discover several interesting revelations
(Section 4). Based on our analysis, we propose novel attacking
strategies to increase the reward of attackers (Section 5 and
6). We also discuss potential strategy space (Section 7.1).
Finally, to mitigate these attacks, we propose practical coun-
termeasures (Section 7.2 and 7.3). However, fully preventing
such attacks remains to be an open problem.
We conclude our revelations as follows:
‚àô BWH and FAW are not optimal for a large parameter
space. We separate the mining process into two phases
and analyze the reward of BWH and FAW. Our analysis
shows that BWH and FAW are not optimal when
considering power adjusting strategies (Section 4.1).
‚àô Power adjusting can improve the attacker‚Äôs reward in
FAW without falling into the ‚Äúminer‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù. We
propose Power Adjusting Withholding (PAW) which
combines power adjusting and FAW, and show PAW
can increase the attacker‚Äôs reward (up to 2.5 times
of the extra reward in FAW) and avoid the ‚Äúminer‚Äôs
dilemma‚Äù in BWH. (Section 5)
‚àô Attackers can adopt bribery racing for a higher reward
in selfish mining. We discuss the ‚Äú0-lead‚Äù racing (two
branches with the same length races each other) and
find the attacker can bribe other miners (targets) to
work on her branch. In most cases, the targets will
choose to extend the attacker‚Äôs branch for a higher
reward (Section 4.2). We further propose Bribery Self-
ish Mining (BSM) which combines bribery racing and
selfish mining, and shows BSM can result in 10% extra
gains for an attacker in comparison with selfish mining
(Section 6).
‚àô Targets can fall into a ‚Äúvenal miner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù in
bribery racing. We discuss multiple targets situations
in bribery racing and find out targets may face a ‚Äúvenal
miner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù: all targets will decide to help the
attacker (extending the attacker‚Äôs branch), but they
will suffer from a loss compared with their rewards
when no one helps (Section 6.3).
2 PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Bitcoin Background
Mining process. In the Bitcoin system, the participants
(miners) record the transfer information in the blocks of a
blockchain. The header of each block contains the hash of
previous block header, a Merkle root [34] of all recorded
transactions, a timestamp, the target (representing the dif-
ficulty ùê∑ of current Bitcoin system), a nonce, etc. Sim-
ply speaking, the mining process is to solve cryptographic
puzzles: generating nonces (PoWs) which make the hash
value of the header satisfy the difficulty constraint, i.e.,
SHA256(SHA256(Block.Header)) < ùê∑. The value of ùê∑ is
adjusted by the Bitcoin system to ensure the time of finding
a new block is about 10 minutes. Once a miner discovers a
valid nonce, it broadcasts the result to allow others to verify.
When the new block is selected as the main (longest) chain,
the Bitcoin system will reward the miner who finds a valid
nonce with 12.5 bitcoins (BTC).
Pooled mining. Since the probability of a solo miner
generating a valid block is very small, solo miners can join
together as mining pools to find nonces, and share the reward
based on their contributions. Though the expected rewards
of pooled mining and solo mining are same (ignoring the
small pool management fee), pooled mining can reduce the
reward variance. Most of the mining pools are maintained
by a manager to distribute work to different pool miners.
Pool miners find and submit shares (FPoW and PPoW) to
show their work done for the pool. Pool managers can use an
FPoW to generate a valid block and get the reward for the
pool. Though a PPoW is useless for generating a new block,
finding a PPoW is much easier than an FPoW, which can
be used to show the effort of pool miners (sharing rewards
based on the number of submitted FPoWs and PPoWs).
Forks. When multiple miners simultaneously broadcast
their discovered blocks, it can cause a fork in the blockchain
since other miners will use the firstly received block as the
new blockchain header [6]. In this scenario, miners continue
mining based on the firstly received block and regard the
heaviest branch (the longest branch has the most accumulated
blocks) as the main chain. Notice that only the miner who
finds a block in the main chain can be rewarded. Forks can
also be intentionally generated, such as in selfish mining or
FAW attacks.
2.2 Related Work
Selfish mining. An attacker can intentionally generate a
fork to earn an extra reward through selfish mining [1, 9].
Specifically, when an attacker discovers a valid block, she
withholds the block as a private chain and continues to find
the next block on the private chain. When other miners
propagate a valid block, the attacker selectively propagates
the withheld blocks to cause a fork. The attacker can earn
an extra reward when the private branch is selected as the
main chain. However, the attacker can also suffer from a loss
when her branch is not chosen. Several approaches have been
proposed to optimize the reward of selfish mining [4, 22, 38].
BWH attacks. An attacker can sabotage the reward
of a victim pool by BWH attacks [5, 37]. Specifically, an
attacker splits her power into innocent mining (mines solely)
and infiltration mining (mines in a pool). The infiltration
mining only submits PPoWs to the manager and withholds
(discards) all discovered FPoWs to make the pool suffer from
a loss (and make innocent mining more profitable at the same
time). When the mining power is split properly, the attacker
can get a higher reward than honest mining [16]. In 2014,
‚ÄúEligius‚Äù suffered from a BWH attack and lost 300 BTC [35].
The attacker was finally found (via statistics) since she only
uses two accounts. However, an attacker can avoid being
detected by using many accounts and frequently replaceing
her pooled miners with new accounts. Pools can also use
BWH attacks against each other (a BWH game). In such
scenarios, attackers will encounter a ‚Äúminer‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù: both
of them will suffer from a loss under the Nash equilibrium
(similar to the ‚Äúprisoner‚Äôs dilemma‚Äù) [7].
FAW attacks. FAW attacks combine selfish mining and
BWH attacks [13]. At first, FAW attacks work similar to
BWH attacks (splitting power into solo mining and pooled
mining). However, when an attacker finds an FPoW in the
victim pool, she withholds the FPoW until other honest solo
miners discover a valid block. Then, the attacker submits
the withheld FPoW to the pool manager to cause a fork as
with selfish mining [13]. By rewarding from intentional forks,
FAW attacks can be more profitable than BWH attacks (the
lower bound of FAW attacks is BWH attacks). Besides, the
miner‚Äôs dilemma may not hold in FAW games (pools use
FAW attacks against each other), since the two-pool FAW
game becomes a pool-size game (the larger pool can get an
extra reward).
Bribery attacks. Bribery attacks can increase the prob-
ability of the attacker‚Äôs branch selected as the main chain
[2, 15]. Since bribery attacks only help the attacker to win
in forks, they have to cooperate with other fork-related at-
tacks, such as double-spending [12] (i.e., plain bribery attacks
cannot bring any profit to an attacker). In bribery attacks,
an attacker will charge other miners with bribes when ex-
tending her branch. For instance, the attacker pre-mines a
block which contains a transaction ùëá ùê¥
ùêµ (ùê¥ is the attacker‚Äôs
address and ùêµ is an address which anyone can claim [2])
and broadcasts a transaction ùëá ùê¥
ùê¥‚Ä≤ which transfers the same
money to another address ùê¥‚Ä≤ of the attacker. After ùëá ùê¥
ùê¥‚Ä≤ is
recorded on the blockchain, the attacker propagates the pre-
mined block to cause a fork. When other miners adopt the
attacker‚Äôs branch, they can claim the bribes in ùêµ. Bribing
can also be made in a less visible way [17]. Bonneau et al. [2]
show the possibility of a successful double-spending increases
with bribery attacks. However, the the amount of bribes is
non-trivial especially when the attacker‚Äôs branch is far be-
hind the main chain [2]. Besides, forking for other purposes
(e.g. blocking transactions [18, 21] or getting higher rewards
[9, 13]) has not been discussed with bribery attacks.
3 THREAT MODEL AND
ASSUMPTION
3.1 Threat Model
An attacker can be a miner or a pool manager in a closed/open
pool. Besides, an attacker can forge different identities to join
multiple open pools with different accounts and IDs via Sybil
attacks. The computational power of an attacker is finite. She
can distribute her power into innocent mining (mining as an
honest solo miner) and infiltration mining (mining in open
pools as in BWH attacks), and adjust the power allocation
dynamically. If the attacker is a manager of an open pool,
her infiltration mining power should be ‚Äúloyal mining power‚Äù
[7]. Lastly, an attacker can plant Sybil nodes in the network
to preferentially propagate the attacker‚Äôs block to increase
the probability of the attacker‚Äôs branch selected as the main
chain when forks occur.
3.2 Assumptions
We made the following assumptions to simplify our analysis,
which are consistent with the assumptions of other Bitcoin
