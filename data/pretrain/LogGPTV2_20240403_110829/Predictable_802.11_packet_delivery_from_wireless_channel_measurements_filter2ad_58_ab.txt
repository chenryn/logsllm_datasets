tween rates (and so only three rates are shown for legibility).

measurements that show RSSI does not predict packet delivery for
real links [3, 22, 30, 31].
Impact of Frequency-Selective Fading. Many possible factors
cause the observed variability for real channels, including NIC cal-
ibration, interference, sampling, and multipath. Here, we look at
frequency-selective fading due to multipath, as our experiments
show this to be a major factor.
Multipath causes some subcarriers to work markedly better than
others although all use the same modulation and coding. These
channel details, and not simply the overall signal strength as given
by RSSI, affect packet delivery. Figure 2 illustrates this with the
measured subcarrier SNRs for four different links in our testbed
averaged over a 5-second run. All links are shown at the closest
transmit power level, in steps of 2 dB, to 80% packet delivery when
using the 52 Mbps rate. However, the fading proﬁles vary signiﬁ-
cantly across the four links. One distribution is quite ﬂat across the
subcarriers, while the other three exhibit frequency-selective fading
of varying degrees. Two of the links have two deeply-faded subcar-
riers that are more than 20 dB down from the peak.
These links harness the received power with different efﬁcien-
cies. The more faded links are more likely to have errors that must
be repaired with coding, and require extra transmit power to com-
pensate. Thus, while the performance is roughly the same, the
most frequency-selective link needs a much higher overall packet
SNR (30.2 dB) than the frequency-ﬂat link (16.5 dB). This differ-
ence of almost 14 dB highlights why RSSI-based SNR does not re-
liably predict performance. Fading and its effects are well-known.
However, it is rare to see data that shows fading for real links and
NICs because it has been difﬁcult to measure.
Impact of multiple streams. The use of multiple antennas adds an-
other dimension to the problem of predicting packet delivery. While

equally well at 52 Mbps. The more faded links require larger
RSSIs (i.e., more transmit power) to achieve similar PRRs.
we do not present further motivating data here, we brieﬂy note that
this makes the problem more difﬁcult, not simpler. To begin with,
there is now an RSSI for each receive antenna. This makes it dif-
ﬁcult to know which RSSI or function of RSSIs to use to predict
delivery even when there is a single spatial stream. When multiple
streams are sent simultaneously, they interfere on the channel. The
MIMO processing used to separate them depends on the details of
the channel, and less of the signal will be harnessed if the RF paths
are correlated. This adds variability that exacerbates fading effects.
3. PACKET DELIVERY MODEL
Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the
packet delivery probability of commodity 802.11 NICs for a given
physical layer conﬁguration operating over a given channel. We
want our model to be simple and practical, so that it can be readily
deployed, and to cover a wide range of physical layer conﬁgura-
tions, so that it can be applied in many settings and for many tasks.
In particular, the scope of our model is 802.11n including multiple
antenna modes, of which single antenna 802.11a/g is a subset. This
scope is sufﬁcient for many current and future networks. We model
delivery for single packet transmission only, leaving extensions for
interference and spatial reuse to future work.
Model Design. The structure of our model is simple: given 1) the
current state of the RF channel between transmitter and receiver,
and 2) a target physical layer conﬁguration of the NIC, it predicts
whether that link will reliably deliver packets in that conﬁguration.
For the ﬁrst piece of input, we use 802.11n Channel State In-
formation (CSI). The CSI is a collection of MxN matrices Hs in
which each describes the RF path (SNR and phase) between all
pairs of N transmit and M receive antennas for one subcarrier s.
It is reported by the NIC in a format speciﬁed by the standard [1],
with details in §4.2. An 802.11n NIC can probe a receiver to gather
CSI, or use channel reciprocity to learn CSI from a received packet.
The CSI is a much richer source of information than the RSSI, and
it gives us the opportunity to develop a much more accurate model.
The second form of input is the target physical layer conﬁgura-
tion for which we want to predict delivery. This is speciﬁed as the
choice of transmit and receive antennas, transmit power level, and
transmit rate (as the combination of modulation, coding, and num-
ber of spatial streams). Other choices, such as beamforming, could
be added in the future. The only restriction is that the CSI includes
the antennas and subcarriers used in the target conﬁguration.
For the model output, we deﬁne that the link will work, i.e., will
reliably deliver packets, if we predict ≥90% packet reception rate.
We do not try to make predictions in the transition region during
which a link changes from lossy to reliable. Predictions there are

error performance on a narrowband channel [18]. For example,
the links in Figure 2 will have effective SNR values that are nearly
equal because they perform similarly, even though their RSSIs are
spread over 15 dB.
The effective SNR is not simply the average subcarrier SNR; in-
deed, assuming a uniform noise ﬂoor, that average is indeed equiv-
alent to the packet SNR derived from the RSSI. Instead, the effec-
tive SNR is biased towards the weaker subcarrier SNRs because it
is these subcarriers that produce most of the errors. If we ignore
coding for the moment, then we can compute the effective SNR by
averaging the subcarrier BERs and then ﬁnding the corresponding
SNR. That is:

BEReff,k =

ρeff,k = BER−1

We use BER−1
to denote the inverse mapping, from BER to SNR.
We have also called the average BER across subcarriers the effec-
tive BER, BEReff. SoftRate estimates BER using internal receiver
state [28]. We compute it from channel measurements instead.
Note that the BER mapping and hence effective SNR are func-
tions of the modulation (k). That is, unlike the RSSI, a particular
wireless channel will have four different effective SNR values, one
describing performance for each of the modulations. In practice, the
interesting regions for the four effective SNRs do not overlap be-
cause at a particular effective SNR value only one modulation will
be near the transition from useless (BER ≈0.5) to lossless (BER
≈0). When graphs in this paper are presented with an effective SNR
axis, we use all four values, each in the appropriate SNR range.
For 802.11n, we also model MIMO processing at the receiver.
To do this we need to estimate the subcarrier SNRs for each spa-
tial stream from the channel state matrix Hs. Although the stan-
dard does not specify receiver processing, we assume that a Min-
imum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver is used. It is compu-
tationally simple, optimal and equivalent to Maximal-Ratio Com-
bining (MRC) for a single stream, and near optimal for multiple
streams. All of these make it a likely choice in practice. The SNR
of the ith stream after MMSE processing for subcarrier s is given
by ρs,i = 1/Yii − 1, where Y =(cid:0)H H
s Hs + I(cid:1)−1 for i ∈ [1, N ]
and NxN identity matrix I [27]. For MIMO, the model computes
the effective BER averaged across both subcarriers and streams.
Coding interacts with the notion of effective SNR in a way that
is difﬁcult to analyze. One challenge is that the ability to correct
bit errors depends on the position of the errors in the data stream.
To sidestep this problem, we rely on the interleaving that random-
izes the coded bits across subcarriers and spatial streams. Assum-
ing perfect interleaving and robust coding, bit errors in the stream
should look no different from bit errors for ﬂat channels (but at a

work is useful information in practice.
802.11 Packet Reception. The model must account for the action
of the 802.11 receiver on the received signal. This is a complex pro-
cess described in many pages of the 802.11n speciﬁcation [1]. Our
challenge is to capture it well enough with a fairly simple model.
We begin by describing the main steps involved (Figure 3).
First, MIMO processing separates the signals of multiple spatial
streams that have been mixed by the channel. As wireless chan-
nels are frequency-selective, this operation happens separately for
each subcarrier. The demodulator converts each subcarrier’s sym-
bols into the bits of each stream from constellations of several dif-
ferent modulations (BPSK, QPSK, QAM-16, QAM-64). This hap-
pens in much the same way as demodulating a narrowband channel.
The bits are then deinterleaved to undo an encoding that spreads
errors that are bursty in frequency across the data stream. A paral-
lel to serial converter combines the bits into a single stream. For-
ward error correction at any of several rates (1/2, 2/3, 3/4, and 5/6)
is then decoded. Finally, the descrambler exclusive-ORs the bit-
stream with a pseudorandom bitmask added at the transmitter to
avoid data-dependent deterministic errors.
Modeling Delivery. We build our model up from narrowband de-
modulation. Standard formulas summarized in Table 2 relate SNR
(denoted ρ) to bit-error rate (BER) for the modulations used in
802.11 [8]. CSI gives us the SNR values (ρs) to use for each sub-
carrier. For a SISO system, ρs is given by the single entry in Hs.
In OFDM, decoding is applied across the demodulated bits of
subcarriers.
If we assume frequency-ﬂat fading for the moment,
then all the subcarriers have the same SNR. The link will behave
the same as in our wired experiments in which RSSI reﬂect real
performance and it will be easy to make predictions for a given SNR
and modulation combination. We can use Figure 1(a) to measure
the ﬁxed transition points between rates and thus make our choice.
Frequency-selective fading complicates this picture as some weak
subcarriers will be much more likely to have errors than others that
are stronger. To model a link in this case, we turn to the notion of an
effective SNR. This is deﬁned as the SNR that would give the same

T1 consists of 10 nodes spread over 8 100 square feet, and T2 consists of 11 nodes

for the different rates; these are ﬁxed for a particular model of NIC
and can be shared once, e.g., during association. The transmitter
also needs up-to-date CSI: either from feedback or estimated from
the reverse path. Alternately, the receiver can request rates and se-
lect antennas directly using the new Link Adaptation Control ﬁeld
of any 802.11n QoS packet [1, §7.1.3.5a]. This obviates sending
CSI, but the calculation instead requires that the transmitter share
its spatial mappings, i.e. how it maps spatial streams to transmit an-
tennas. These are likely to change less frequently than the channel,
if at all. Finally, when operating in either mode with fewer trans-
mit streams than antennas, the transmitter must occasionally send a
short probe packet with all antennas to measure the full CSI.
Summary and Example. Combining the above steps, our model
consists of the following: 1) CSI is obtained and a test conﬁg-
uration is chosen; 2) the MMSE expression is used to compute
per-stream, subcarrier SNRs from the CSI for the test number of
streams; 3) the effective SNR is computed from the per-stream,
subcarrier SNRs for the test modulation; and 4) the effective SNR
is compared against the pre-determined threshold for the test mod-
ulation and coding to predict whether the link will deliver packets.
As an example, Figure 5 shows the CSI for a SISO link (steps 1–
2) as a fading proﬁle across subcarriers, with the computed effective
SNRs for all modulations (step 3). These effective SNRs are com-
pared with pre-determined thresholds (step 4, see §5) to correctly
predict that the best working rate will be 39 Mbps. Note that these
effective SNRs are well below the RSSI-based packet SNR that is
biased towards the stronger subcarriers (note the logarithmic y-axis
scale). This link does a poor job of harnessing the received power
because it is badly faded, so its RSSI is a poor predictor of rate.
Applications can use this model to ﬁnd useful conﬁgurations
without sending packets to test them. For example, the highest rate
can be predicted by running the model for all candidate rates and
selecting the best working rate. Alternatively, we could predict the
minimum transmit power to support a rate.
4. TESTBEDS
We conduct experiments using two stationary wireless testbeds
deployed in indoor ofﬁce environments, T1 and T2 (Figure 4). T1
consists of 10 nodes spread over 8 100 square feet. T2 is less dense
by comparison with 11 nodes over 20 000 square feet. Each testbed
covers a single ﬂoor of a multi-story building and has a variety of
links in terms of maximum supported rate and line-of-sight versus
multi-path fading. We conduct mobile experiments using laptops
that interact with testbed nodes and are conﬁgured in the same way.

fective SNRs for different modulations. BPSK has the lowest
effective SNR, but it needs less energy to decode.
