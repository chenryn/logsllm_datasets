ABSTRACT 
Attack  trees  are  a  popular  graphical  notation  for  capturing 
threats  to  IT  systems.  They  can  be  used  to  describe  attacks  in 
terms of attacker goals and attacker actions. By focusing on the 
viewpoint of a single attacker and on a particular attacker goal in 
the  creation  of  an  attack  tree,  one  reduces  the  conceptual 
complexity  of  threat  modeling  substantially  [1].  Aspects  not 
covered  by  attack  trees,  like  the  behavior  of  the  system  under 
attack,  can  then  be  described  using  other  models  to  enable  a 
security analysis based on a combination of the models. 
Despite  the  high  popularity  of  attack  trees 
in  security 
engineering  for  many  years,  some  pitfalls  in  their  use  were 
identified  only  recently  [2].  In  this  talk,  I  will  point  out  such 
difficulties, outline how attack trees can be used in combination 
with  system  models,  and  clarify  the  consequences  of  different 
combinations  for  security  analysis  results.  After  a  security 
analysis  of  an  abstract  model,  the  insights  gained  need  to  be 
mapped  to  reality.  I  will  introduce  an  automata-based  model  of 
run-time monitors [3] and will show how defenses in this model 
can be realized at runtime with the CliSeAu system [4,5].

BIOGRAPHY  
Heiko  Mantel  is  a  full  professor  for  Computer  Science  at  TU 
Darmstadt.  His  research 
include 
IT  security 
interests 
in 
language-based  security,  security  engineering,  information-flow 
security,  and  side-channel  analysis.  From  2010  to  2017,  he  was 
the spokesman of the national research initiative Reliably Secure 
Software  Systems,  funded  by  the  German  Science  Foundation.  
Since  2018,  he  leads  the  Software-Factory  4.0  initiative,  which 
aims  for  efficient,  flexible  and  reliable  solutions  to  software  re-
engineering,  funded  by  the  state  of  Hesse.  He  is  or  has  been 
involved 
in  many  other  research  projects  as  principal 
investigator. 
Previously,  Heiko  Mantel  was  assistant  professor  at  the  RWTH 
Aachen,  postdoctoral  researcher  at  the  ETH  Zurich,  and 
researcher  at  the  German  Research  Center  for  Artificial 
Intelligence.  He  received  his  Ph.D.  from  Saarland  University  in 
2003.
