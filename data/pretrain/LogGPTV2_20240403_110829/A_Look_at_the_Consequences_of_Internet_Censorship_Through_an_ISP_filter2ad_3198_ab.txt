or out of the ISP’s premises. The ISP assigns each BRAS to a set of
addresses. While the allocation remains unchanged for any given
trace, across traces the captures correspond to potentially different
subsets of the ISP’s address space.
Address Pools. The ISP splits its address space into dynamic
DHCP and static pools, primarily assigning dynamic IPs to res-
idential customers. The ISP reserves some static IP addresses for
hosting its services, such as DNS resolvers, mail and authentication
servers, and other web resources. It allocates the bulk of the re-
mainder to SOHO customers. We do not know which IP addresses
correspond to particular ISP services; in particular, we have no
speciﬁcs regarding its censorship apparatus, related IP addresses,
or blacklists in effect for different traces. Note that the ISP does
not allocate IPv6 addresses to its customers. While we ﬁnd some

Table 2: Breakdown of data sanitization and characterization. P=Porn, Y=YouTube
example, to gauge the interest of local users in Web content served
over the Internet, we only consider outbound connections—see Ta-
ble 2 for an overview.
With regards to direction, we label a connection as local if it
has both source and destination IP addresses in the ISP’s network
block, or transit if neither source nor destination belongs to the
local network. We consider a connection inbound if its origina-
tor resides outside the ISP’s network and outbound if the converse
holds.
We further differentiate between residential and SOHO trafﬁc
based on the assumption that nearly all static IP addresses corre-
spond to SOHO users, where we determine the set of static IP ad-
dresses using information provided by the ISP.
Table 2 summarizes these characterizations. We ﬁnd that out-
bound connections predominate, followed by inbound, local and
transit, in that order. The small portion of transit trafﬁc agrees
with a communication from the ISP that we should expect a small
amount of trafﬁc from a sister ISP, along with some IPv6 test trafﬁc.
3.4 Final Datasets
Table 3 summarizes our ﬁltered dataset. We divide our six traces
into two datasets corresponding to residential and SOHO users re-
spectively. We use both datasets to study the impact of porn cen-
sorship, and the SOHO dataset for YouTube censorship, since the
post-YouTube censorship traces contain only small amounts of res-
idential trafﬁc. For a major part of our study, we work with HTTP
and DNS logs for outbound and local connections. We include lo-
cal trafﬁc in our analysis because we expect to ﬁnd a portion of user
trafﬁc redirected to local systems enforcing censorship.
3.5 User Survey
Finally, we carried out an online user survey targeting Pakistani
users in order to develop an understanding of their views of and re-
sponses to the YouTube block. (We avoided asking about the porn
block as it is a culturally sensitive topic in the region.) We dissemi-
nated information about the opportunity to take the survey through
mailing lists and classroom discussions. The survey asked about:
(i) the popularity of blocked content and new players that emerged
post-censorship, (ii) user inclinations to circumvent and the corre-
sponding mechanisms, (iii) collateral damage experienced due to
the block, and (iv) opinions about Internet censorship in general.
We did not expect many responses because it is hard to get users
to respond to surveys without any incentive, especially when the
topic is a sensitive one such as Internet censorship. Surprisingly,
we received 770 responses (75% male, and 25% female), reﬂect-
ing a widespread eagerness to comment on the subject. 94% of the
responders were young/middle-aged (25-40 years), and resided in
major cities, with occupations suggestive of high levels of techno-
logical competence. This demographic does not reﬂect Pakistan’s
makeup as a whole, and likely skews towards particularly informed
and active users. Thus, we do not frame its results as representative,
but rather as illuminating of some of the facets of how censorship
affects Pakistani users.
4. ESTABLISHING GROUND TRUTH
A signiﬁcant challenge for our study is that we use historical
data for which we lack key contextual information: (i) what was
censored (the blacklist for the porn block), and (ii) how it was cen-
sored (the mechanism of censorship). In this section we discuss the
methodology we employed to answer these questions based solely
on the information present in the available traces. We do so by an-
alyzing the responses we see from servers in reply to user requests,
basing our deductions on the observation that for enforcing cen-
sorship, a censor either silently drops requests or sends back false
response packets.
4.1 Censorship Indicators
A censor can block HTTP content at any of the layers involved in
facilitating an HTTP transaction: DNS, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Across
these layers, the censor has an array of choices for how to block,
each leaving a trail in the network traces. The presence of such
a trail (a sequence of packets not necessarily contiguous, or an
absence of expected packets) provides an indicator of censorship.
However, some of these indicators can occur in an uncensored envi-
ronment for legitimate reasons such as measurement loss or exces-
sive server load. We deem censorship indicators that can also occur
under uncensored conditions as ambiguous, and deal with them as
follows: (i) If the censored content is known, we attribute a high
frequency of an ambiguous indicator to censorship (and leverage
this information to establish the mechanism of censorship); but (ii)
if the censored content is unknown (that is, we cannot tie any given
ﬂow to an attempt to access blocked content), we cannot attribute
the occurrence of such an indicator over a short observation win-
dow (less than one day for each of our traces) exclusively to cen-
sorship. We therefore do not leverage these latter indicators, and
rely only on unambiguous indicators to establish (partial) ground
truth.
We now discuss assessing censorship indicators at each layer.
DNS Based Censorship. At the DNS level, a censor-controlled
resolver (such as one maintained by the present ISP) can effect
blocking behavior by sending: (i) No Response, (ii) False Error
(such as NXDOMAIN), or (iii) False Response (the RCODE for these
responses is NO ERROR). (Clearly, users can bypass these DNS-
based censorship mechanisms by using an independent DNS re-
solver.)
No Response provides an ambiguous indicator because it could
occur due to excessive load on the resolver, or network problems.
Thus, we do not attribute this scenario to censorship when the cen-
sored content is unknown. However, for known censored content,
observing a consistent behavior of no response is a strong indicator
of censorship.

Table 3: Final data after preprocessing. P=Porn, Y=YouTube
For the last two cases, we can leverage two public databases to
establish the ground truth: (i) dnsdb, which contains historical
information on name-to-IP address mappings [38], and (ii) Team
Cymru’s IP-to-ASN mappings database [40]. We identify false
responses as follows:
False Error: We mark the queries that consistently receive an
ERROR RCODE response from a resolver for a subsequent dnsdb
lookup. If there exists a name-to-IP mapping in the database for
the domain seen in the trace, we conclude that the censor employed
False Error as their mechanism.
False Response: We can detect a DNS resolver including false
IP addresses in its responses if we observe consistency in the false
answers returned. We identify whether a DNS resolver answers
with an IP address belonging to an ISP within the country (either lo-
cal ISP or an upstream transit provider from within Pakistan) when
the domain is actually hosted elsewhere. Let ASNtrace be the ASN
of an IP address returned in a DNS reply recorded in the trace, and
ASNreal be the ASN for the IP address received in a DNS reply
