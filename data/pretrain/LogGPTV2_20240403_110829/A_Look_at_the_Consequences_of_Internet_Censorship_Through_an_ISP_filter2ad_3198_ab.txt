### Network Configuration and Address Allocation

The Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns each Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS) to a specific set of IP addresses. While the allocation remains consistent for any given trace, different traces may correspond to varying subsets of the ISP's address space.

#### Address Pools
The ISP divides its address space into dynamic DHCP and static pools. Dynamic IPs are primarily assigned to residential customers, while static IPs are reserved for hosting essential services such as DNS resolvers, mail servers, authentication servers, and other web resources. The bulk of the remaining static IPs are allocated to Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) customers. We do not have specific information about which IP addresses correspond to particular ISP services, including details about the censorship apparatus, related IP addresses, or blacklists in effect for different traces. Additionally, the ISP does not allocate IPv6 addresses to its customers.

### Data Sanitization and Characterization

Table 2 provides a breakdown of the data sanitization and characterization process. For example, to gauge the interest of local users in web content served over the Internet, we only consider outbound connections.

### Connection Classification

- **Local Connections**: Both source and destination IP addresses are within the ISP’s network block.
- **Transit Connections**: Neither source nor destination IP belongs to the local network.
- **Inbound Connections**: Originator is outside the ISP’s network.
- **Outbound Connections**: Originator is inside the ISP’s network.

We differentiate between residential and SOHO traffic based on the assumption that nearly all static IP addresses correspond to SOHO users, using information provided by the ISP.

### Final Datasets

Table 3 summarizes the filtered dataset. We divide our six traces into two datasets: one for residential users and another for SOHO users. We use both datasets to study the impact of porn censorship and the SOHO dataset for YouTube censorship, as the post-YouTube censorship traces contain only small amounts of residential traffic. Our analysis focuses on HTTP and DNS logs for outbound and local connections, as we expect some user traffic to be redirected to local systems enforcing censorship.

### User Survey

We conducted an online user survey targeting Pakistani users to understand their views and responses to the YouTube block. The survey covered:
1. The popularity of blocked content and new players that emerged post-censorship.
2. User inclinations to circumvent and the corresponding mechanisms.
3. Collateral damage experienced due to the block.
4. Opinions about Internet censorship in general.

Despite the sensitivity of the topic, we received 770 responses, with 75% male and 25% female participants. Most respondents were young/middle-aged (25-40 years), residing in major cities, and had occupations suggesting high technological competence. This demographic does not represent Pakistan as a whole but provides valuable insights into how censorship affects informed and active users.

### Establishing Ground Truth

A significant challenge in our study is the lack of contextual information about what was censored (the blacklist for the porn block) and how it was censored. We use the available traces to deduce this information by analyzing server responses to user requests, assuming that a censor either silently drops requests or sends back false response packets.

#### Censorship Indicators

Censors can block HTTP content at various layers: DNS, TCP/IP, and HTTP. Each layer offers multiple blocking methods, leaving distinct traces in network captures. Some indicators can also occur in uncensored environments due to legitimate reasons like measurement loss or excessive server load. We classify these as ambiguous and handle them as follows:
- If the censored content is known, a high frequency of an ambiguous indicator is attributed to censorship.
- If the censored content is unknown, we do not attribute such indicators to censorship over short observation windows.

##### DNS-Based Censorship
At the DNS level, a censor-controlled resolver can block content by:
- Sending no response.
- Sending a false error (e.g., NXDOMAIN).
- Sending a false response (RCODE NO ERROR).

**No Response**: Ambiguous, as it could be due to resolver overload or network issues. Consistent no response for known censored content is a strong indicator of censorship.

**False Error and False Response**: We use public databases like dnsdb and Team Cymru’s IP-to-ASN mappings to identify false responses. If a domain has a valid name-to-IP mapping in the database but receives an error or false IP, we conclude that the censor used these methods.

For further validation, we compare the ASN of the IP address returned in the DNS reply (ASNtrace) with the actual ASN (ASNreal) of the domain's host.
