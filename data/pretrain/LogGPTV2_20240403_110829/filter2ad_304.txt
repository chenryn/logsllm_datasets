ABSTRACT
Using the Internet and other electronic media for our daily
tasks has become common. Thereby a lot of sensitive infor-
mation is exchanged, processed, and stored at many diﬀer-
ent places. Once released, controlling the dispersal of this
information is virtually impossible. Worse, the press reports
daily on incidents where sensitive information has been lost,
stolen, or misused - often involving large and reputable orga-
nizations. Privacy-enhancing technologies can help to min-
imize the amount of information that needs to be revealed
in transactions, on the one hand, and to limit the disper-
sal, on the other hand. Many of these technologies build on
common cryptographic primitives that allow for data to be
authenticated and encrypted in such a way that it is possi-
ble to eﬃciently prove possession and/or properties of data
revealing the data or side-information about it. Proving
such statements is of course possible for any signature and
encryption scheme. However, if the result is to be practi-
cal, special cryptographic primitives and proof protocols are
needed.
In this talk we will ﬁrst consider a few example scenarios
and motivate the need for such cryptograph building block
before we then present and discuss these. We start with
eﬃcient discrete logarithms based proof protocols often re-
ferred to as generalized Schnorr proofs. They allow one to
prove knowledge of diﬀerent discrete logarithms (exponents)
and relations among them. Now, to be able to prove posses-
sion of a (valid) signature and a message with generalized
Schnorr proofs, it is necessary that the signature and the
message signed are exponents and that no hash-function is
used in the signature veriﬁcation. Similarly, for encryption
schemes, the plain text needs to be an exponent. We will
present and discuss a number of such signature and encryp-
tion schemes.
To show the power of these building blocks, we will con-
sider a couple of example protocols such as anonymous ac-
cess control and anonymous polling. We then conclude with
a discussion on security deﬁnition and proofs. We hope that
the presented building blocks will enable many new privacy-
preserving protocols and and applications in the future.

Biography
Jan Camenisch received a Diploma in Electrical Engineering
in 1993 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1998 both from
ETH Zurich. From 1998 until 1999 he has been Research
Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University
of Aarhus, Denmark. Since 1999 he is Research Staﬀ Mem-
ber and project leader at IBM Research – Zurich. He was
also the technical leader of the EU-funded projects PRIME
(prime-project.eu) and PrimeLife (primelife.eu) which both
contributed towards making on-line privacy a reality.
His research interests include public key cryptography;
cryptographic protocols, in particular those supporting pri-
vacy and anonymity; practical secure distributed computa-
tion; and privacy-enhancing technologies.
