### 1. Overview

#### Types of Vulnerabilities
- **Forced Device Pairing**: Unauthorized devices can be paired with the dongle.
- **Keystroke Sniffing**: Keystrokes can be intercepted by an attacker.
- **Unencrypted Keystroke Injection**: Keystrokes can be injected into unencrypted channels.
- **Encrypted Keystroke Injection**: Keystrokes can be injected even in encrypted channels.
- **Malicious Macro Programming**: Macros can be programmed to execute malicious code.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Devices can be rendered unusable.

#### Common Transceivers
- **General Purpose Transceivers with Proprietary Protocols**
- **Mouse/Keyboard Specific Transceivers Used As-Is**
- **All Devices Use 2.4GHz GFSK**
- **Combination of Protocol Weaknesses and Implementation Flaws**

##### Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L
- 2.4GHz general-purpose transceivers
- Data rates: 250kbps, 1Mbps, 2Mbps
- CRC: 0, 1, or 2 bytes
- Frequency range: 2400-2525MHz, 1MHz steps
- Options: XCVR only or 8051-based SoC

##### nRF24L Family
- Shockburst and Enhanced Shockburst

##### Texas Instruments CC254X
- 2.4GHz general-purpose transceivers
- Used in some Logitech keyboards and mice
- Logitech firmware is OTA compatible with nRF24L-based devices

##### MOSART Semiconductor
- Undocumented transceiver
- Baked-in mouse/keyboard logic
- No encryption
- Common with second-tier vendors

##### Signia SGN6210
- (Mostly) undocumented transceiver
- General-purpose transceiver
- No encryption
- Found in Toshiba mice and keyboards

##### GE Mystery Transceiver
- Undocumented transceiver
- Unknown manufacturer
- No encryption

### 2. Research Process

**Logitech's Statement:**
"Since the displacements of a mouse would not give any useful information to a hacker, the mouse reports are not encrypted."

#### Tools and Methods
- **Software Defined Radio (SDR)**
  - Great for prototyping and receive-only reverse engineering
  - Not ideal for two-way communications
  - Retune timing limitations and USB/processing latency make ACKs difficult
  - Initial Logitech mouse reverse engineering was SDR-based

- **NES Controller**
  - Built a wireless NES controller for a Burning Man hat
  - nRF24L/Teensy based
  - Adapted for Logitech mouse controller

- **CrazyRadio PA**
  - nRF24LU1+ based dongle
  - Part of the CrazyFlie project
  - Open source
  - 225-meter injection range with Yagi antenna
  - Custom firmware for fuzzing

#### Fuzzing Process
1. Install CrazyRadio and target mouse/keyboard dongle into the same computer
2. Disable magic sysrq
3. Float the input devices in xinput
4. Turn on usbmon and watch the output of the mouse/keyboard dongle
5. Fuzz away
6. If the USB dongle does something, save the last few seconds of RF TX data
7. Investigate

### 3. Protocols and Vulnerabilities

#### Logitech Unifying
- **Proprietary Protocol**: Used by most Logitech wireless mice/keyboards
- **nRF24L Based**: Some devices use CC254X
- **Introduced in 2009**
- **Any Unifying Dongle Can Pair with Any Unifying Device**
- **Dongles Support DFU**: Most devices do not

##### Logitech Unifying - Radio Configuration
- **Packet Structure**
- **Encryption**
  - 128-bit AES
  - Key generated during pairing process
  - Most keystrokes are encrypted
  - Multimedia keystrokes (volume, navigation, etc.) are not
  - Mouse packets are unencrypted

##### Logitech Unifying - General Operation
- **USB Dongles Always in Receive Mode**
- **Mice and Keyboards Always in Transmit Mode**
- **ACK Payloads Enable Dongle-to-Device Communication**

##### Logitech Unifying - Addressing
- **nRF24L Supports Max 6 Receive Pipes**
- **Unifying Supports Max 6 Paired Devices**
- **Unifying Dongle Always Listens on Its Own Address**
- **Device Sends Wakeup Packet When Turned On**

##### Logitech Unifying - Keepalives and Channel Hopping
- **Paired Device Specifies a Keepalive Timeout**
- **If Timeout Missed, Dongle Channel Hops to Find It**

##### Logitech Unifying - Mouse Input
- **Encrypted Keystroke**
- **Unencrypted Multimedia Key**

##### Logitech Unifying - Dongle to Device Communication
- **Mouse or Keyboard Transmits Packet to Dongle**
- **Dongle Attaches Payload to ACK**
- **Status Inquiries (Battery Level, etc.)**
- **OTA Firmware Update Commands**
- **Configuration Commands (Button Macros, etc.)**

##### Logitech Unifying - Pairing
- **Dedicated Pairing Address: BB 0A DC A5 75**
- **In Pairing Mode, Dongle Listens for 30-60 Seconds**
- **When Device Can’t Find Its Dongle, It Tries to Pair**
- **Device Specifies Name, Model, Serial Number, and Capabilities**
- **Generic Process for Backward and Forward Compatibility**

##### Logitech Unifying - Unencrypted Keystroke Injection
- **Unencrypted Keystrokes Can Be Injected into the Address of Already Paired Keyboards**
- **Example: 'a' Key Down (Scan Code 4)**
  - 00 C1 00 04 00 00 00 00 00 3B
- **Example: 'a' Key Up (No Scan Codes Specified)**
  - 00 C1 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 3F

##### Logitech Unifying - Forced Pairing
- **Attacker Transmits Pairing Request to Address of Already Paired Mouse**
- **Dongle Replies with an Assigned RF Address**
- **Attacker Transmits (Arbitrary) Serial Number to Dongle on the Newly Assigned RF Address**
- **Dongle Echoes Back Serial Number**
- **Attacker Transmits Device Name**
- **Dongle Echoes Back Some Bytes from the Pairing Process**
- **Attacker Transmits Pairing Complete Message**

##### Logitech Unifying - Pair Keyboard as Mouse
- **Attacker Transmits Pairing Request to Address of Already Paired Mouse**
- **Dongle Replies with an Assigned RF Address**

This structured and detailed overview should provide a clear and professional presentation of the research and findings.
