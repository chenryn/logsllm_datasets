User: I am in Windows and Suppose I have a main python code that calls python interpreter in command line to execute another python script ,say test.py .
So test.py is executed as a new process.How can I find the processId for this porcess in Python ?
Update:
To be more specific , we have os.getpid() in os module. It returns the current process id.
If I have a main program that runs Python interpreter to run another script , how can I get the process Id for that executing script ?
Assistant: You will receive the process ID of the newly created process when you create it. At least, you will if you used fork() (Unix), posix_spawn(), CreateProcess() (Win32) or probably any other reasonable mechanism to create it.
If you invoke the "python" binary, the python PID will be the PID of this binary that you invoke. It's not going to create another subprocess for itself (Unless your python code does that).
