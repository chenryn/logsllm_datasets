User: major noob question:
when I run python on the windows command line, it says I have 2.4.5... however, it's not in my PATH environment variable (or anywhere in my environment variables), and, Python27 IS in PATH! Anyone know how I can get Python27 up and running in windows cmd?
Assistant: Trying running WHERE PYTHON (or WHERE PYTHON.EXE) to figure out where the python executable is at.
It may be that python v2.4.5 is as part of another program.
