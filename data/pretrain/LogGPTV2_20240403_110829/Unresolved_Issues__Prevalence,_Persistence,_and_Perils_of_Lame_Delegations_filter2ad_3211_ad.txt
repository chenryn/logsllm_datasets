10Successful resolution requires any part of the delegation chain for the NS name to
work. We do not exhaustively check every step of the chain as our perspective does
not require it and doing so would exponentially increase measurement overhead.

Table 8: Partly lame domains by number of delegated NS.
the delegation is lame (Section 2.3). Our measurement reveals cases
in which NS hosts do not exist, do not run a nameserver, or are not
able to provide authoritative responses. It is not always possible to
distinguish non-operational servers from network outages. Name-
servers that we cannot reach after repeated attempts, we infer to
be lame.
6.2 Domain Perspective
Table 7 summarizes the results of our active measurements, includ-
ing the number of domains resolved, the total number of name-
servers used by those domains, and the total number of IP addresses
associated with the nameservers. The table classifies domains into
two categories, fully and partly lame. A fully lame domain means
that we did not obtain an authoritative answer from any name-
server or IP enumerations for that domain. A partly lame domain
means that we did not obtain an authoritative answer from at least
one nameserver and IP enumeration for that domain. Note that the
partly lame metric also includes the fully lame cases.
At the time of our measurements roughly 10% of domains were
fully lame (not resolvable) consistently across the TLDs.11 This
number increased to 14% of domains when considering partly lame
domains (has at least one lame delegation, but not all). There are
various reasons why actively resolving a domain can fail, from
typos in names to placing recursive (non-authoritative) resolvers
in NS records. For the 10% fully lame domains, the most prevalent
issues that we encountered are nameservers that do not (or cannot)
11Note that this percentage is similar to the results from Pappas et al. [21] in 2004. As
the timeseries from Section 5 highlights, lame delegations have long been a persistent
issue in the DNS.

provide an authoritative answer, or nameservers that cannot be
reached (i.e., query timeouts). Only a small percentage of cases
resulted from typos in NS records.
Partly lame delegations were only 3–5% more common than
fully lame. Since Table 7 counts the fully lame cases as also partly
lame, it shows that more often than not, if a domain has any lame
nameserver path, all of its paths do not resolve. The exceptions are
the new gTLDs grouped under ngTLDs. Nearly 20% of domains we
queried in ngTLDs had at least one nameserver path that did not
resolve. This behavior could derive from ngTLDs domains being
concentrated on many fewer nameservers than other TLDs. ngTLDs
have roughly half the number of nameservers and corresponding IPs
when compared to legacy gTLDs with similar number of domains.
Table 7 also breaks down the nameserver IP addresses into fully
and partly lame. A fully lame IP address means that, when querying
that IP to resolve a domain, that IP does not return an authoritative
answer for all domains for which we queried it. A partly lame IP
address means that the IP does not return an authoritative answer
for at least one domain for which we queried it.
The fact that partly lame domains still resolve underscores the
benefits of redundancy in the DNS. Table 8 classifies partly lame
domains by the number of delegated nameservers. The first row
corresponds to domains with just one nameserver, which by defi-
nition are misconfigured since RFC 1034 requires a domain have
two nameservers at least [19]. With one lame nameserver, these
domains are all unresolvable. As the number of nameservers in-
creases, the percentage of partly lame domains naturally increases.
The more delegated nameservers, the higher the probability that at

Table 10: Top fully lame delegated NS IPs and domains.
least one of them at any time is lame. These results highlight the
fact that DNS redundancy may obscure configuration issues, since
the domain is often still resolvable even when misconfigured.
6.3 Nameserver Perspective
We next look at the nameservers responsible for lame delegations.
Table 9 shows the number and percentage of actively discovered
fully lame nameservers across TLDs. Consistent with the results
of our static analysis, .biz stands out with an unusually high per-
centage of fully lame nameservers (Section 5.3). There were 14,311
nameservers in .biz in our active measurement set, and 73.6%
of them were fully lame. Domains using the unresolvable .biz
nameservers predominantly come from the legacy TLDs .com and
.net, again consistent with the long-standing practice of handling
expired nameservers within those TLDs.
Looking at nameserver domains and their IPs more closely, lame
delegation is concentrated and the most prevalent nameservers
and IPs suggest that they, at least, are lame delegated by design
and not due to misconfiguration. Table 10 reports the top fully
lame delegated NS records and IPs. The top nameserver domain
is associated with suspicious bulk domain registrations.12 Manual
inspection shows that the others are primarily sinkholes for security,
abuse, and expired domains where delegated domains have been
made lame intentionally. The top IP serves parked and for-sale
domains, the next two IPs are used by 0088dns.com, and the last
two IPs are used in glue records for nameservers in maff.com with
a large number of apparently abusive domains.
6.4 Consistency
The DNS ultimately depends upon multiple independent sources
of information to operate correctly. However, as a hierarchical,
delegation-based distributed system, the DNS does not contain
inherent internal mechanisms to ensure consistency across these
independent records. Inconsistencies arise for a variety of reasons,

Table 11: AA false lame delegated IPs.
two of which we describe: inconsistencies in authoritative responses
and glue records.
6.4.1 Authoritative Consistency. By definition, authoritative name-
servers should reply with authoritative responses (setting the AA
flag). In a small percentage of cases (0.1–0.3%) authoritative name-
servers do not reply as authoritative, creating lame delegations as a
result. Table 11 shows the top 10 nameserver IPs that do not set the
AA flag, ranked by the number of nameserver domains associated
with those IPs. These turn out to be wildcard nameservers, which
set the AA flag to false for NS queries and true for any A queries.
The top nameservers group in pairs based on country code. In fact,
the nameserver pairs are used as the two nameservers for parking
domains, which obviates the need to update nameserver zone file
records.
6.4.2 Glue Consistency. One can obtain IP addresses of name-
servers by examining glue records in zone files, or by actively
querying for their A records. These two methods should ideally
yield the same set of IP addresses, but we find a surprising degree
of inconsistency between the glue records in zone files and those
returned by active queries. We examined the consistency between
the set of IP addresses in the zone glue records (“parent” zone glue
P) and the glue records retrieved via DNS queries (the “child” zone
glue C).
Table 12 shows two interesting results between the two perspec-
tives. First, similar to the results for domains in Table 7, a significant
number of glue records cannot be resolved by querying, particularly
for glue record IPs used by nameservers in the ngTLDs.
Second, for the glue records that can be queried, most are con-
sistent (P = C). But from 5.5–11.4%, depending on the TLD, have
inconsistent glue records. Table 12 further breaks down the rela-
tionships between the two sets P and C into four categories: the sets
of glue records are completely disjoint (P ∩ C = ∅); the parent zone
glue records are a subset of the child zone glue records (P ⊂ C);
and the parent zone glue records are a superset of the child zone
(P ⊃ C); and sets that otherwise overlap in at least one address
(“Rest”). The breakdown shows that the dominant inconsistencies
are entirely disjoint: the child zone glue records are completely
different from the parent zone glue records. As a result, for nearly
