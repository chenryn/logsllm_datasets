User: I am attempting to try out Google App Engine with python.  Being familiar with Eclipse, I decided to use PyDev.  After some trouble, I have a hello world program working... almost.  It cannot find the webapp2 import, telling me it is unresolved.  I have followed all of the instructions I can find, and have the google app engine libraries linked up - I think.  I have searched for webapp2 as a potential import, and cannot find this anywhere in any of the library files.  I am really new to python in general, and even newer to the Google App Engine, so I am certain that this is a simple problem that is exacerbated by my newness.
I am running on OS-X, running Eclipse Indigo Service Release 1.  I have the latest version of PyDev available for download as of Tuesday evening.
Assistant: I encounter this problem, too.
And I follow TorelTwiddler's instruction -> he's right, there's no webapp2.
You have to add ${GOOGLE_APP_ENGINE}/lib/webapp2 to the "External Libraries".
This occurs because(I guess) you only change the interpreter of the project, not create a whole new GAE project with PyDev.
This action didn't re-scan the libs it should include.
If you are Create a new GAE project w/ Pydev, you'll see webapp2 is in the external libs' list.
