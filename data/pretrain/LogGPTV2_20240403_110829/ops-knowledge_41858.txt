I understand that you are trying to set up a Google App Engine (GAE) project using Python and Eclipse, specifically with the PyDev plugin. You have managed to get a basic "Hello World" program running, but you are encountering an issue where the `webapp2` import is unresolved. This problem seems to be related to the configuration of your development environment.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve this issue:

### 1. Verify Your Google App Engine SDK Installation
Ensure that you have the Google App Engine SDK installed and that it is correctly set up in your environment. The `webapp2` library is included in the GAE SDK, so you should not need to install it separately.

### 2. Add the Google App Engine Libraries to PyDev
You need to add the `webapp2` library to the external libraries in PyDev. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Locate the `webapp2` Library:**
   - The `webapp2` library is typically located in the `lib` directory of your Google App Engine SDK. For example, if your GAE SDK is installed at `/path/to/google_appengine`, the `webapp2` library will be at `/path/to/google_appengine/lib/webapp2`.

2. **Add the Library to PyDev:**
   - Open Eclipse.
   - Go to `Window` > `Preferences`.
   - In the Preferences window, navigate to `PyDev` > `Interpreters` > `Python Interpreter`.
   - Select the interpreter you are using for your GAE project.
   - Click on the `Libraries` tab.
   - Click `New Folder` and add the path to the `webapp2` library (e.g., `/path/to/google_appengine/lib/webapp2`).

### 3. Configure Your Project to Use the Correct Interpreter
If you created your project without specifying the GAE-specific interpreter, you may need to reconfigure it:

1. **Right-click on your project** in the Project Explorer.
2. Select `Properties`.
3. Go to `PyDev - Interpreter/Grammar`.
4. Ensure that the correct interpreter (the one with the GAE libraries) is selected.
5. Click `Apply and Close`.

### 4. Create a New GAE Project
If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider creating a new GAE project from scratch using PyDev:

1. **File** > **New** > **Other**.
2. Select `PyDev Google App Engine Project` and click `Next`.
3. Follow the wizard to create a new GAE project. This process will automatically configure the necessary libraries, including `webapp2`.

### 5. Re-scan the Libraries
If you have already created a GAE project and changed the interpreter, you may need to force PyDev to re-scan the libraries:

1. **Right-click on your project** in the Project Explorer.
2. Select `PyDev` > `Update PYTHONPATH` > `Force Refresh`.

### Additional Tips
- **Check for Updates:** Ensure that both Eclipse and PyDev are up-to-date. Sometimes, bugs and issues are resolved in newer versions.
- **Consult Documentation:** Refer to the official Google App Engine and PyDev documentation for any additional setup instructions or troubleshooting tips.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `webapp2` import issue and continue developing your GAE project. If you encounter further problems, feel free to provide more details, and I can offer more specific guidance.
