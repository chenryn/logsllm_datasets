varied across capabilities (p = 0.001).
“Play music”
(68.4 %) and lawnmower-related capabilities (64.7 % for
creating rules for the mower, 68.2 % for turning lawn
mower on/off remotely) were particularly sensitive to the
time of the day. In order to not interrupt other people’s
rest, participants tended to limit lawnmower usage usage
to the daytime and playing music to the early evening.
E) Location of User
Capabilities that change devices’ behaviors tended to be
more sensitive to where the user is physically located
when trying to control the device (p . As discussed, capabilities better capture the
nuances of access control in the home than devices. Ap-
pendix A lists capabilities commonly supported by cur-
rent home IoT platforms. UserType captures the rela-
tionship of the user to the home, and to the owners.
From our study, these types should nonexhaustively in-
clude: Spouse, Teenager, Child, Babysitter, and Neigh-
bor. Spouses tend to be users with the highest levels
of access, generally equivalent to administrators in tra-
ditional computing systems. Context refers to the envi-
ronmental factors that might affect an access-control de-
cision. For example, certain parents might be more per-
missive in allowing a child to watch TV without supervi-
sion. Based on our study, at the minimum context should
include: Time, User Location, Age, People Nearby, Cost
of Resource, Device State, Device Location, and Usage
History. Depending on the Capability and the UserType
components of the triplet, the importance of the context
can change. For example, for a UserType of Child, the
‘People Nearby’ contextual factor plays a prominent role
in the access-control decision. However, for spouses, it
generally has no bearing. The same goes for the Capa-
bility. The ‘Device Location’ contextual factor is crucial
for camera-related capabilities, but not so important for
the capability of adding a new user.
Mapping Authorization and Authentication. Al-
though we focused on analyzing access control, we
brieﬂy discuss how our ﬁndings affect the design of au-
thentication mechanisms. Below, we discuss a set of au-
thentication mechanisms and comment on their ability
to identify users, relationships, and contextual factors.
We also discuss privacy limitations and the effect of false
positive and negatives.
Smartphones are the most widely used devices to ac-
cess IoT devices in the home. Users may present their
identity to a device using a password, PIN, or (more
recently) ﬁngerprints. These identities can be used by
home IoT devices to determine the identity, and hence
relationship, of the person attempting access. From the
perspective of false positives/negatives, smartphones can
closely match user expectations. They are inconvenient,
however, for temporary visitors because they require the
visitor to install an app and the owner to authorize them.
Wearable devices like watches, glasses, and even
clothing [18] might serve as proxy devices with more
natural interactions than a smartphone. For example, a
user can gesture at a nearby device to control it (e. g.,
wave at a light to turn it on or off). As each user will
