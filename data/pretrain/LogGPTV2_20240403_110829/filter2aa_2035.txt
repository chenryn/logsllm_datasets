Re: 
Notice of Ex Parte Communication, ET Docket Nos. 04-186, 02-380 
Dear Ms. Dortch: 
On March 13, 2007, on behalf of a coalition that includes Dell, Inc., Google, Inc., the Hewlett-
Packard Co., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., and Philips Electronics North America Corp., Srihari 
Narlanka of Microsoft; William Brown and John Clark, outside consultants to Microsoft; and 
Edmond Thomas and S. Roberts Carter of Harris, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP submitted a 
prototype TV band device to the FCC Laboratory for testing.  The above-named individuals also 
met with Rashmi Doshi, Steven Jones, and Steven Martin of the Office of Engineering and 
Technology to provide instruction on the operation of the device.   
On March 14, 2007, Messrs. Thomas, Narlanka, Brown, and Clark met with Messrs. Doshi and 
Jones as well as Thomas Phillips of the OET staff to discuss further the operation of the device.  
In addition, the Coalition provided OET staff with a copy of the device manual, attached hereto.      
Pursuant to the Commission’s rules, a copy of this notice is being filed electronically in the 
above-referenced dockets.  If you require any additional information please contact the 
undersigned at (202) 730-1305.   
Sincerely yours,

1. 
SYSTEM OBJECTIVE AND OVERVIEW  
The Microsoft TV White Spaces Development Platform is a development platform to 
explore, develop and evaluate technologies required to create a commercially viable 
cognitive radio-based communications network product.  With the Microsoft Cognitive 
Radio, developers will be able to: 
• 
Create spectrum scanning and signal feature recognition software and 
hardware used to co-exist and avoid interfering with incumbent operators. 
• 
Develop and refine transmit power control algorithms. 
• 
Explore and test waveforms and modulation techniques with minimal 
interference with expected TV band signals. 
• 
Perform on-air propagation and coverage measurements. 
2. 
 SYSTEM OPERATION 
The Microsoft TV White Spaces Development Platform assembly consists of two core 
system assemblies:   
• 
A Wide-band Spectrum Scanner and Network Processor and a tunable 
UHF Half-Duplex Transceiver controlled by the Network Processor; and 
• 
A Windows-based PC using the Internet Explorer browser as the 
command and control interface. 
2.1 
System Operation 
• 
A broadband 521 to 698 MHz computer controlled frequency 
scanner and high-speed digitizer capable of incrementally 
scanning UHF TV channels 21 through 51 in 6 MHz segments.  
The digitized time domain 6 MHz scan information is passed to 
the network analyzer where a 2048 FFT is performed.   
• 
Signal feature templates for DTV, NTSC and wireless microphone 
devices are sequentially applied to the FFT information to identify 
occupied DTV or NTSC channels.  Non-occupied channels are 
declared potential white channels and subsequently scanned for 
potential narrow band incumbents such as wireless microphones.   
• 
Scanner control and discovery information is presented via the 
Internet Explorer Web Browser.

2.2 
UHF Radio Network Processor Assembly 
The UHF Tx/Rx Assembly consists of three sub-components: 
• 
S-Band (2.4 GHz) 802.11g OFDM modem located in the Network 
Processor 
• 
Half-duplex S-Band to UHF block converter  
• 
Network Processor Browser for Frequency and Power Control 
UHF radio specifications are presented in Table 1. 
3. 
INTERNET EXPLORER SCANNER AND TX PANELS

browser control panel.  Specific controls include: 
• 
The ability to select any operating frequency between 521 to 698 MHz in 
1 MHz increments 
• 
Tx power output control from -10 dBm to +20 dBm 
• 
Ability to search individual UHF TV channel groups for occupied DTV or 
NTSC channels. 
• 
Ability to search out candidate white channels for wireless microphone-
like signals.
