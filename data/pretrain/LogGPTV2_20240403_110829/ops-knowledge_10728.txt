User: I've created a tar.gz of a package that includes a setup.py file. setup.py uses the setup() function provided in distutils.core. I want to prompt the user when they run "pip install .tar.gz". Unfortunately, it looks like pip redirects all stdout and stderr of the "python setup.py install" command through a special log filter, which reads stdout line by line. This means I can't have a prompt such as "Email: ..." since "Email: " will not get printed until after the user has pressed enter. Also, the log filter indents every line of output, which is not ideal.
Assistant: Don't do that.
If it is absolutely necessary to have information from the user during the install, ask for an environment variable to be set, and fail if it is not set. Better yet, require a plain text configure file to run your module - and set it with default values during the install
Don't try to make an interactive session needed during the install, because the idea of PIP and easy_install are that they also install the pre-requisites of a package - so they may install a lot of packages in a batch,. The user will just expect pip install to do its job, and an unexpected interactive prompt will ruin automated installs, pre-requiste chains, buildout installs, remote installs, and so on.
