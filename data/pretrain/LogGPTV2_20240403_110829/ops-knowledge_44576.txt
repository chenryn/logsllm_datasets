User: I've got a C# app running under Windows and Linux. I would like to implement a way to communicate with it through a Python script. 
I've already tried using ZeroMQ library, and it was working right when the C# app was running on Windows - I could send/receive messages on both ends. But I failed miserably when I tried to use on Linux/Mono - the app crashed, kernel32 exception. I tried recompiling the libzmq.dll, using the tutorials, but I can't get it right. 
Is there any other way to do this, or should I stick with ZeroMQ and try to get it running on Linux/Mono?
Assistant: You can always open up a TCP or UDP socket and communicate through that.
