User: Is there official documentation on the Python website somewhere, on how to install and run multiple versions of Python on the same machine on Linux?
I can find gazillions of blog posts and answers, but I want to know if there is a "standard" official way of doing this?
Or is this all dependent on OS?
Assistant: It's most strongly dependent on the package distribution system you use.  For example, with MacPorts, you can install multiple Python packages and use the pyselect utility to switch the default between them with ease. At all times, you're able to call the different Python interpreters by providing the full path, and you're able to link against all the Python libraries and headers by providing the full paths for those.
So basically, whatever way you install the versions, as long as you keep your installations separate, you'll able to run them separately.
