Proof. The elaborate proof can be found in [13] and we summa-
rize it as follows.
We will use an induction argument. In a (γ ,s)-respecting environ-
ment, s ≥ 2(1+δ)γ
m/f covers at least the first epoch. It is easy to
2
see that if the initial target is good, the rounds in the first epoch are
good, and the first target recalculation point is good. We will prove
that the subsequent rounds and target recalculation points are good
using an induction argument shown in Figure 17. The predicates are
defined as follows.
We prove NoStaleChains(r) from GoodRounds(r −1) using typi-
cality bounds, showing that the adversary cannot accumulate more
difficulty than the lower bound of the minimum chain growth, QP .
Let w be the timestamp of the last honest block on the stale chain. Set
U ={u :w ≤u ≤ r}, S ={u :w +∆≤u ≤ r−∆} and J be the adversarial
queries in U . We will first consider the case where the chain has
more than one target recalculation point. In this case we divide J into
sub-queries Ji such that each subset covers at least m/2 blocks and
has exactly one target recalculation point in it. In this case, we have
i(1 +ε)p|Ji| = (1 +ε)p|J|. We arrive at a con-
tradiction by showing (1+ε)p|J| is lower than QP(S)’s lower bound.
In case of at most one target recalculation point, if A(J) QP(S)(1−ε)[1−(1+δ)γ
Proof. This follows from the definition of typicality, we use the

following inequalities

The following proposition will be useful in the proof of non-pivot
chain’s common prefix.

The last inequality implies from Proposition 1.
Case 3: Consider the case when x s/2−ℓ−2∆. Let
S′ := {u : x + ∆ ≤ u ≤ w − ∆}, U P = {u : x ≤ u ≤ r} and J P be the set
of adversarial queries for the proposal tree in the rounds U P . The
difficulty accumulated in the chain C∗ in J P queries is more than
that of the chain growth in S′.
