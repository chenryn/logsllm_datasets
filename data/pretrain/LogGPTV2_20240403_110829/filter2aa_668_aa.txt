Abstract
Industrial designers working in traditional media have the luxury of sketching, playing, and experimenting with their
materials before constructing a finished product. Designers working with electronics and computers are relatively
impoverished. To “sketch” with electronics or computers would typically require extensive training in engineering
and ready access to inexpensive parts—requirements that most designers can’t easily meet. This deficiency—this
inability to work closely with materials before building with them—hampers designers’ efforts to make products
sensitive to human use. This paper describes an attempt to address this problem in a human-computer interaction
(HCI) design studio at a major design school. The course itself was an exercise in design: it worked within severe
constraints to address a human need. We describe our attempt to shape the course to meet students’ most pressing
needs; our students’ attempts to work within the constraints of the course; and the outcomes of the course for
students and faculty. The paper suggests that the course offers one way to experiment with HCI concepts, produce
innovative solutions to design problems, and—crucially—humanize new technologies and the design process.

Problem Statement
How can industrial design (ID) students in a human-computer interface design studio course use electronics and
computers with the same speed, fluidity, and fearlessness afforded by less expensive and more flexible materials?
How can the studio encourage students to be sensitive to human need—and to the complicated material and
programmatic elements of their media? How can the studio create an environment in which students can use
computer hardware and software as sketch materials? How can industrial designers extend their knowledge of
engineering without encroaching on the work of engineers? How can an HCI studio balance an exploration of
technology with a commitment to human-centered design? How can the course itself be approached as a design
problem?

History and Context
The model for this studio curriculum was developed and tested in American and Swedish graduate and
undergraduate departments of industrial design and digital media. Tellart, a design consultancy owned and operated
by the faculty of this course, developed and donated many of the ideas and tools involved with the course.

Challenge
In the development of this studio course, the department, faculty, and students worked within numerous political,
economic, intellectual, and technological constraints. These included:
• 
students with varying experience in digital technologies;
• 
the cost and complexity of electronics as raw materials for rapid and fluid design concept sketching;
• 
the learning curve involved with computer programming for the ID student developing HCI
concepts;
• 
departmental budgets for computer hardware and software tools and materials;
• 
institutional control over computer labs, servers, software purchases, and installations;
• 
the environmental impact of sketching with plastic and silicon-based materials (sketch models are
often modified and discarded as design concepts develop).
The challenge of the course was to work within these constraints and still humanize the educational experience, the
design process, and the technologies used in the course.

Solution
5.1 
Process
When we first contemplated the course, we started with what seemed a simple question: How can an ID student
sketch efficiently and effectively for HCI concepts using computer hardware and software? Because we have taught
the course several times, revising it each time, the shape and nature of the course have changed significantly. Still,
we always worked within the rough parameters of the standard design workshop: class time was spent on
demonstrations by faculty, field trips, guest lectures, discussions and critiques of exercises, short assignments, and a
final project. Our task was to humanize the process—to turn our students’ attention toward human need, and to
allow them to experiment with their materials in a way that enhanced their understanding of HCI issues. In this
section we’ll describe the process of refining the conceptual design of the course; in the following section we’ll
describe in detail the ways in which we adapted our use of technology in the studio to meet students’ needs.
In the first iteration of the course, we asked students to work in teams of three on a broad conceptual problem:
Design a human-computer interaction about an unmediated human experience in nature. This approach—team-based
and abstract—was designed to ease students into the course material, to encourage collaboration, and to prompt
playful, creative experimentation.
What happened? The students struggled to balance what seemed to be competing needs: to work in conceptual terms
and to design useful, human-centered products. Students were eager to make finished products—and voluntarily
spent a good deal of money on materials with which to make them. (This proved to be doubly frustrating. Because
they worked in teams, no one member could claim the final product.) But the problem we had given them was vague
enough that they weren’t able to make use of their existing knowledge or to explore more advanced ideas about
human need, use value, and the manufacturing process. The nature of the assignment also came to frustrate the
professors: our evaluations were necessarily more subjective than we had hoped. Finally,  because students couldn’t
customize or miniaturize many of the electronics and hardware components, they designed installation-size projects
(10’x10’x10’)—an approach that  absorbed too much studio space and forced them to begin the labor of production
too early, cutting short their time for experimenting. We had, in fact, encouraged them to use installations; we
thought that form would expand the range of input possibilities.
In the second iteration of the course, we asked students to work on a more concrete problem, and we did away with
mandatory group work for the final project. Our assignment was: Design models and documentation for an
interactive product that will serve a human need. We asked for looks-like and works-like models and Web-based
documentation, and this proved to be a major advancement. Rather than trying to miniaturize electronics and code
and build finished prototypes, students spent more time on research and experimentation. They focused on the scope
of human factors, the capabilities of their technologies, and the challenge of communicating their concepts in a
compelling, efficient form. The students seemed relieved not to have to worry about group dynamics. One
significant problem: Because their solutions were so diverse, they couldn’t take full advantage of our critiques; the
projects didn’t lend themselves to comparison.

In the third iteration of the course, we asked students to design an interactive digital product for use by a human in
an extreme environment—an even more specific task that led to more focused discussions and a concentrated use of
materials. It also forced students to consider more carefully than before two key issues: human use and
environmental conditions. Students also took advantage of inexpensive new computer input/output technologies,
including software developed by our firm, Tellart, and hardware developed by Making Things. Now their material
palette became expansive: they could work with analog sensory data input and analog voltage output. Rather than
using switches to control content, they could use continuous analog sensing (sensors that track motion, touch, etc.).
And with analog voltage output, they could control any electrical appliance—not simply audio and video content.
We also encouraged them to consider networked products—products that can communicate with each other, and
stable input controls that manage the content of Web pages and electrical appliances in various locations.
The course in its current form is the result of a series of conceptual, pedagogical, and technological refinements,
each related to the other. A conceptual adjustment was necessarily a pedagogical adjustment, which was necessarily
a technological adjustment. In a way, this may be one of the course’s significant lessons: no idea, no action, no
material exists in isolation. To conceive of a project, to study it, to work with its materials—these activities are parts
of a whole.

Solution Details
In this section, we describe our use of technology in the course. As we suggested above, every technological
refinement affected the conceptual design of the course, our pedagogical approach to the course, and our students’
outcomes.
The first iteration of the studio experience began with an act of destruction: students took apart discarded off-the-
shelf computer hardware—keyboards, mice, game controllers. This was also an act of creation: the electronic
components became raw material for sketch-modeling.
Why use salvaged hardware? First, it allows greater freedom to experiment. The parts have been donated or found in
the garbage; students are relieved of the stress of working with expensive materials. Second, it makes smart use of
environmental and financial resources. Plastic and silicon parts are given at least one additional use and then
recycled; and already limited course budgets and lab fees can be put toward field trips, books, and other materials.
