ABSTRACT
Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring
any network to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high
volume, the victim often cannot handle these attacks alone and
needs help from upstream ISPs. Today’s Internet has no automated
mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and
ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a
security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS
attacks. SENSS enables the victim of an attack to request attack
monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services
rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote
ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated
by these ISPs, without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and
generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and
mitigation approaches against a variety of DDoS attacks. SENSS is
deployable with today’s infrastructure, and it has strong economic
incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very
effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct
customers of early adopters, and considerable protection to remote
victims when deployed strategically. Deployment on the largest 1%
of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but everyone
on the Internet, from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks.

INTRODUCTION
1
Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can over-
whelm even the largest networks. In 2016, Dyn, a large and geograph-
ically distributed DNS management network, was hit by 1.2 Tbps
attack [35], from more than 100,000 sources. In 2018, Github was hit
by a 1.35 Tbps attack, from thousands of autonomous systems and
tens of thousands of hosts [29]. Distributed attacks create problems
not just for their victims, but also for the ISPs and bystanders, which
share the path with attack traffic [6].
Volumetric DDoS attacks cannot be handled by the victim alone,
and require help of other networks. When the attack’s volume is so
high that it overwhelms the victim’s link to its ISP, or even a link
within the ISP, this ISP or other upstream ISPs must help in the
attack’s mitigation. Similarly when the attack is indistinguishable
from legitimate traffic, filtering at the victim has a high collateral
damage. Upstream networks can help identify locations close to
attack sources, and place filters at these locations, where they inflict
a lower collateral damage.
Today’s Internet has no automated mechanism for victims to ask
their peers or remote networks for help in attack handling, and has
low incentives for ISPs to offer such services. While most ISPs will
help when engaged, asking for help occurs through human channels
today, and the ISP’s response is often limited to blackholing all
traffic to the victim [32].
We propose SENSS, a framework for collaborative defense agai-
nst volumetric DDoS attacks. Using SENSS, the victim of an attack
can request help from direct and remote networks (called “ISPs” in
the rest of the paper) in an automated and secure manner, and pay
on demand for the services rendered. The victim sends messages to
SENSS-enabled ISPs (“SENSS ISPs” for short), asking for traffic
and/or route monitoring or control actions. Each message is signed
by the victim and authenticated by SENSS ISPs, which prevents
misbehavior and misuse. Replies to monitoring messages bring infor-
mation to the victim, which it can combine with its own knowledge
of its traffic and business priorities, to devise custom attack mitiga-
tion. The victim then issues control messages to SENSS servers to
mitigate the attack. SENSS APIs at ISPs can be readily implemented
by today’s infrastructure, which makes SENSS cheap for ISPs to
deploy and incentivizes deployment.
Our first contribution is the novel design of the SENSS frame-
work, for secure, automated, on-demand collaboration between vic-
tims and ISPs (Section 3). SENSS has two main design principles:
(1) Intelligence at the victim, simple functionalities at ISPs. Many
collaborative defenses place intelligence (e.g., deep packet
inspection – DPI) in the cloud or at an ISP, which makes
defense functionalities complex and costly. In SENSS, the
victim drives all the decisions, such as what to monitor and

which actions to take to mitigate attacks. This allows for sim-
ple functionalities at ISPs, which are easily implemented in
the current ISP infrastructure. Intelligence at the victim makes
SENSS cheap for ISPs, and effective in sparse deployment.
It also limits the impact of misbehaving participants (Sec-
tion 3.5). Victims that lack technical skills to make decisions
about attacks can delegate SENSS control to their ISPs or to
third parties via SENSS’s proxy mechanism (Section 3.5).
(2) Versatile, evolvable and customizable defense. Many defenses
today work against one or a few attack variants. SENSS’s
simple APIs can be used as building blocks by the victims to
create customized defenses against many DDoS flavors. As
attacks evolve, these simple APIs can be used to build new
defenses on top of the existing SENSS infrastructure.
Our second contribution lies in novel algorithms for handling
of direct floods, reflector attacks and cross-fire attacks, all described
in Section 3. These algorithms and SENSS enable the following
novel functionalities that are not available in today’s defenses: (1)
mitigation of direct floods close to attackers, (2) surgical mitigation
of reflector attacks, (3) mitigation of cross-fire attacks.
Our third contribution is a thorough evaluation of SENSS us-
ing simulation on the Internet’s AS-level topology and emulation
on the Deterlab testbed [2] (Section 4). SENSS is very effective in
sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of
early adopters, and considerable protection to remote victims when
deployed strategically. In case of 2016 attack on Dyn, SENSS de-
ployment at Cogent, Level 3, Zayo and Comcast would have filtered
100% of the attack. In general case, deployment on the largest 1%
of ISPs would protect not just direct customers of these ISPs but
everyone on the Internet from 90% of direct floods and reflector
attacks. SENSS further filters attacks closer to their sources, and
saves twice as much bandwidth as cloud-based defenses. SENSS
overhead within an ISP remains constant irrespective of attack’s
complexity or its volume, and SENSS’s handling of client requests
requires just a fraction of a second.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section we discuss types of DDoS attacks that we would
like to address, and the need for a collaborative defense between
victims and ISPs. We also survey related work in the operational and
research realms, and position SENSS in this landscape.
2.1 Volumetric Attacks
DDoS attacks overwhelm the victim with excessive traffic, sent from
many sources. In this work we focus on three variants of volumetric
attacks, which usually cannot be handled at the victim: direct floods,
reflector attacks and cross-fire attacks. We use the term floods to
refer to all three of these variants. Direct floods send traffic directly
to the victim. Reflector attacks send request traffic to public servers
(e.g., DNS servers), spoofing the victim’s address, and the servers
reply to the victim, overwhelming it. Cross-fire attacks send traffic to
many destinations. This traffic congests some bottleneck link in an
ISP, which is also shared by the victim’s inbound traffic. In all three
cases, there is a tree-like pattern of traffic, with attack and legitimate
sources being the leaves and the bottleneck link being the root. This
is illustrated in the Figure 1(a).
Because volumetric attacks only need to generate high enough
volume to DoS the victim, they do not have to have a specific sig-
nature. They can also be spoofed. Further, they can be launched
from many distributed sources. The 2016 Dyn attack [35] and 2018
Github attack [29] were launched from 10,000 – 100,000 of sources,
distributed over thousands of networks.
2.2 Related Work
DDoS defense is a mature field. In this Section we focus only
on defenses, which address volumetric attacks, and on collaborative
DDoS defenses.
Victim-end defenses, such as Bro [27] or Arbor APS [25] are
often used to detect and filter smaller DDoS attacks. However, large
volumetric attacks cannot be handled by the victim, because the
bottleneck is upstream from the victim’s network.
First-ISP. The victim can engage its ISP through human channels,
to help in mitigation, i.e., to filter the attack. Most ISPs offer only
crude filtering of all traffic to the victim, aka remotely-triggered
black hole (RTBH) [32]. This protects ISP infrastructure, but cuts
the victim off the Internet and exacerbates the impact of the attack.
Bohatei [8] is a research defense within a single ISP. It uses
software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtual-
ization (NFV) to offer flexible, elastic DDoS defense. It instantiates
a number of VMs on demand, and steers victim’s inbound and
outbound traffic through these VMs, which implement custom miti-
gation programs. Bohatei’s custom programs offer finer-grain traffic
analysis at a higher resource cost (statistics storage and application
header access) than SENSS. SENSS is complementary to Bohatei,
as it handles spoofed and cross-fire attacks, which cannot be handled
by Bohatei.
Cloud-based defenses, such as CloudFlare [6] and Zenedge [36],
defend against attacks through geo-replication of the victim’s re-
sources. To effectively defeat floods, this geo-replication needs to
be extensive, requiring equipment and peering contracts at many
locations and a lot of excess bandwidth to withstand high-volume
attacks. When a cloud wants to grow, it has to enter into more
peering agreements and buy and install more equipment and fiber;
both are expensive. Clouds attract all the victim’s inbound traffic
to themselves, and apply “packet scrubbing” to identify an attack
signature and filter the attack traffic. Clean traffic is then tunneled to
the victim. The scrubbing process is proprietary, but it often involves
deep-packet inspection (DPI), and thus has a high processing cost.
Compared to clouds, SENSS enables ISPs on the attack path to
offer a distributed attack response, through victim-ISP collabora-
tion. ISPs deploy SENSS on their existing infrastructure, leveraging
existing functionalities like SDN, Flowspec [22], Netflow and ac-
cess control lists (ACLs). This makes SENSS’s deployment costs
smaller than that of clouds. On the other hand, SENSS filters are
coarser-grain (network- and transport-level but not application- or
payload-level) than those of clouds, which may lead to a higher
collateral damage for application-level attacks. For this reason, SE-
NSS focuses only on handling of volumetric attacks, which usually
randomize fields after the transport header.

SENSS infrastructure grows when more networks adopt SENSS
and start supporting it on its existing infrastructure. This makes
SENSS growth more sustainable than cloud growth.
We illustrate handling of network floods by clouds and by SENSS
in Figures 1(b) and 1(c) respectively. While clouds divert the victim’s
inbound traffic to their infrastructure, SENSS empowers ISPs on the
traffic’s path to help in attack diagnosis and mitigation. This saves
more bandwidth (see Section 4.4).
Collaborative defenses. The need for collaborative defense agai-
nst evolving DDoS attacks was elaborated by Kang et al. in [14].
There are several collaborative research approaches to DDoS mitiga-
tion, such as Pushback [12], traceback [10], StopIt [20], AITF [1],
DefCOM [26], CoDef [19], SIBRA [4], SCION [28], TVA [34], De-
fense by Offense [33] and SPIFFY [15]. Some of these approaches
are not deployable today, because they require Internet redesign –
TVA and SCION. Other approaches are less deployable than SENSS,
because they require router hardware changes. Traceback, StopIt,
AITF, CoDef and DefCOM require packet marking at routers, and
StopIt requires cryptographic operations on traffic.
Further, some approaches apply victim-to-source collaboration
model – StopIt, Defense by offense and CoDef – which has the
victim ask the source networks (legitimate or attack) for help in
attack mitigation. Victim-to-source collaboration cannot be effective
in sparse deployment, because many sources would reside in legacy
networks. SENSS, on the other hand, is very effective in sparse
deployment, thanks to its victim-to-ISP collaboration model. Even a
