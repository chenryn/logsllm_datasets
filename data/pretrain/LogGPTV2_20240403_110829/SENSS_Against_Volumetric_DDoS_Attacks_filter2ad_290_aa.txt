## Abstract
Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can incapacitate any network. Due to their distributed nature and high volume, victims often cannot handle these attacks alone and require assistance from upstream Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Currently, there is no automated mechanism for victims to request help from ISPs, and ISPs do not typically offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS allows the victim to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to immediate and remote ISPs in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs without prior trust. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against various DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with today’s infrastructure and offers strong economic incentives for both ISPs and victims. It is highly effective even in sparse deployment, providing full protection to direct customers of early adopters and considerable protection to remote victims when strategically deployed. Deployment on the largest 1% of ISPs can protect everyone on the Internet from 90% of volumetric DDoS attacks.

## Introduction
Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can overwhelm even the largest networks. For example, in 2016, Dyn, a large DNS management network, was hit by a 1.2 Tbps attack from over 100,000 sources [35]. In 2018, GitHub faced a 1.35 Tbps attack from thousands of autonomous systems and tens of thousands of hosts [29]. These distributed attacks not only affect the victims but also cause problems for ISPs and other networks sharing the same path [6].

Volumetric DDoS attacks cannot be handled by the victim alone and require the help of other networks. When the attack volume exceeds the victim's link capacity to its ISP, or even within the ISP, the ISP or other upstream ISPs must assist in mitigating the attack. Similarly, if the attack is indistinguishable from legitimate traffic, filtering at the victim's end can cause significant collateral damage. Upstream networks can help identify locations close to the attack sources and place filters where they cause less collateral damage.

Currently, there is no automated mechanism for victims to request help from peers or remote networks, and ISPs have little incentive to offer such services. While most ISPs will assist when engaged, the process is manual and often limited to blackholing all traffic to the victim [32].

We propose SENSS, a framework for collaborative defense against volumetric DDoS attacks. Using SENSS, the victim can request help from direct and remote ISPs in an automated and secure manner, and pay on demand for the services rendered. The victim sends messages to SENSS-enabled ISPs, asking for traffic and/or route monitoring or control actions. Each message is signed by the victim and authenticated by the ISPs, preventing misbehavior and misuse. Replies to monitoring messages provide information to the victim, which it can combine with its own knowledge to devise custom attack mitigation strategies. The victim then issues control messages to SENSS servers to mitigate the attack. SENSS APIs at ISPs can be readily implemented using existing infrastructure, making it cost-effective for ISPs to deploy and incentivizing adoption.

### Key Contributions
1. **Novel Design of SENSS Framework**: SENSS is designed for secure, automated, and on-demand collaboration between victims and ISPs. It follows two main principles:
   - **Intelligence at the Victim, Simple Functionalities at ISPs**: Unlike many collaborative defenses that place intelligence in the cloud or at an ISP, SENSS places decision-making at the victim's end. This allows for simple functionalities at ISPs, which can be easily implemented in current infrastructure. Victims lacking technical skills can delegate SENSS control to their ISPs or third parties via a proxy mechanism.
   - **Versatile, Evolvable, and Customizable Defense**: SENSS provides simple APIs that can be used as building blocks to create customized defenses against various DDoS flavors. As attacks evolve, these APIs can be used to build new defenses on top of the existing SENSS infrastructure.

2. **Algorithms for Handling DDoS Attacks**: We introduce novel algorithms for handling direct floods, reflector attacks, and cross-fire attacks. These algorithms and SENSS enable functionalities not available in current defenses, such as:
   - Mitigation of direct floods close to attackers.
   - Surgical mitigation of reflector attacks.
   - Mitigation of cross-fire attacks.

3. **Thorough Evaluation**: We evaluate SENSS using simulations on the Internet's AS-level topology and emulations on the Deterlab testbed [2]. SENSS is highly effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters and considerable protection to remote victims when strategically deployed. For instance, in the 2016 Dyn attack, SENSS deployment at Cogent, Level 3, Zayo, and Comcast would have filtered 100% of the attack. Generally, deployment on the largest 1% of ISPs would protect everyone on the Internet from 90% of direct floods and reflector attacks. SENSS filters attacks closer to their sources, saving twice as much bandwidth as cloud-based defenses. The overhead within an ISP remains constant, and handling client requests takes just a fraction of a second.

## Background and Related Work
### Types of DDoS Attacks
DDoS attacks overwhelm the victim with excessive traffic from many sources. We focus on three variants of volumetric attacks: direct floods, reflector attacks, and cross-fire attacks. Direct floods send traffic directly to the victim. Reflector attacks spoof the victim's address, causing public servers to reply to the victim. Cross-fire attacks congest bottleneck links shared by the victim's inbound traffic. These attacks form a tree-like pattern, with attack and legitimate sources being the leaves and the bottleneck link being the root (Figure 1(a)).

### Related Work
#### Victim-End Defenses
Defenses like Bro [27] and Arbor APS [25] are used to detect and filter smaller DDoS attacks. However, large volumetric attacks cannot be handled by the victim alone due to upstream bottlenecks.

#### First-ISP Assistance
Victims can engage their ISP through manual channels to help mitigate attacks, often by blackholing all traffic to the victim. This protects the ISP's infrastructure but cuts the victim off from the Internet, exacerbating the attack's impact.

#### Cloud-Based Defenses
Cloud-based defenses like CloudFlare [6] and Zenedge [36] defend against attacks through geo-replication of the victim's resources. This requires extensive peering contracts and excess bandwidth, making it expensive to scale. Clouds attract all inbound traffic, apply packet scrubbing to filter attacks, and tunnel clean traffic to the victim. This process is proprietary and involves deep-packet inspection (DPI), leading to high processing costs.

Compared to clouds, SENSS enables ISPs on the attack path to offer a distributed response through victim-ISP collaboration. ISPs deploy SENSS on existing infrastructure, leveraging SDN, Flowspec [22], Netflow, and access control lists (ACLs). This makes SENSS more cost-effective to deploy. However, SENSS filters are coarser-grain (network- and transport-level) than those of clouds, potentially leading to higher collateral damage for application-level attacks. SENSS focuses on volumetric attacks, which randomize fields after the transport header.

#### Collaborative Defenses
Collaborative defenses, such as Pushback [12], traceback [10], StopIt [20], AITF [1], DefCOM [26], CoDef [19], SIBRA [4], SCION [28], TVA [34], Defense by Offense [33], and SPIFFY [15], have been proposed. Some, like TVA and SCION, require Internet redesign and are not deployable today. Others, like traceback, StopIt, AITF, CoDef, and DefCOM, require router hardware changes and packet marking, making them less deployable than SENSS. SENSS, with its victim-to-ISP collaboration model, is highly effective in sparse deployment, unlike victim-to-source models that rely on legacy networks.
