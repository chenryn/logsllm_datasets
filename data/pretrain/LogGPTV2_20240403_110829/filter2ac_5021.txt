**ATT&CK ID:** T1011  
**Technique Name:** Exfiltration Over Alternative Network Medium

**Description:**
Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data using a network medium that is different from the one used for command and control (C2) communication. For example, if the C2 channel is established over a wired Internet connection, the adversary might choose to exfiltrate data via alternative means such as a Wi-Fi connection, a modem, a cellular data network, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel. This tactic can help adversaries avoid detection by security systems that are monitoring the primary C2 channel.
