User: Without root access, how do I change the default Python from 3.5 to 2.7 for my specific user? Would like to know how to run Python scripts with Python 2 as well.
If I start up Python by running simply python then it runs 3.5.2. I have to specifically run python2 at the terminal prompt to get a version of python2 up.
If I run which python, then /data/apps/anaconda3/bin/python gets returned and I believe Python 2.7 is under /usr/bin/python.
This is on CentOS if that helps clarify anything
Assistant: If you are looking to change the python interpreter in anaconda from 3.5 to 2.7 for the user, try the command conda install python=2.7
