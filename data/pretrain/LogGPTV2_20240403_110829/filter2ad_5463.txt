ABSTRACT
As more and more systems are controlled by computers and
connected to the Internet, a tremendous amount of activity
is generated when these systems interact with each other
and with their users. The continuous stream of data re-
lated to such Internet-connected and computer-controlled
systems is known as Big Data and introduces problems at
new scales. Computer security and privacy can both beneﬁt
and suﬀer from Big Data, as tools and techniques are made
readily available to process security-event streams and as at-
tacks are harder to detect in the huge volume of event data.
The BADGERS’12 workshop is a forum for discussing the
challenges in and potential solutions for taking advantage
of Big Data for improving computer security and privacy.
The workshop builds on the successful ﬁrst edition of BAD-
GERS which was held in conjunction with the EuroSys 2011
conference in Salzburg, Austria [3].

1. OVERVIEW
In contrast to the systems community, security researchers
have only recently started collecting and looking at Internet-

scale, real-world data (e.g., the European WOMBAT [2]
and the US PREDICT [1] initiatives). Experimental secu-
rity analysis performed on such data is often hampered by
concerns such as conﬁdentiality, privacy, and liability.
In
many cases, the owners of security-relevant data require re-
searchers to sign non-disclosure agreements, eﬀectively lim-
iting the scientiﬁc impact of any results obtained from the
data.
At the same time, there is a growing need to widen the scope
of data-driven security analysis and to create Internet-scale
algorithms, techniques, and tools for analyzing the security
and protecting the privacy of computer interactions. As at-
tackers have become experts in leveraging the whole Internet
to achieve their goals, we need to understand their modus
operandi and their motivations, and thus we require both
access to Internet-scale, real-world data and techniques to
mine it for relevant security information.
The BADGERS workshop is positioned at the conﬂuence
of computer security and general-purpose large-scale data
processing and aims at bringing together people (e.g., re-
searchers, practitioners, system administrators, system pro-
grammers) active in the emerging domain of security-related
data collection and analysis for Internet-scale computer sys-
tems and networks. By giving visibility to existing solutions,
the workshop promotes and encourages the better sharing of
data and knowledge. The increasing availability of tools and
techniques to process the large-scale data (aka “Big Data”)
will necessarily beneﬁt computer security.
2. TOPICS
The BADGERS workshop is intended to report on initia-
tives for Internet-scale security-related data collection and
analysis. It provides an environment for describing existing
real-world, large-scale datasets, and to share with the secu-
rity community the return on experiences acquired by ana-
lyzing such collected data. Furthermore, novel approaches
to collect and study such data sets are welcome. Main topics
of interest include the following:
• Scalable data collection from networks, hosts, or ap-
plications;
• Real-time gathering and aggregation of diverse sets of
raw data;
1066• Summarization of raw data with respect to security
goals;
• Attack-resilient data collection;
• Characterization of dataset external validity;
• Scalability of security analysis with data volume;
• Scalability of security analysis with concurrent-attack
volume;
• Combined historical and real-time security analysis;
• Evaluating result accuracy for large datasets;
• Real-time, incremental anonymization for data shar-
ing;
• Successful, failed, and novel models of data sharing;
• Sharing of analysis results and supporting data;
• Internet-scale sharing of security knowledge
• Legal issues around data collection and sharing.
Additionally the workshop welcomes forward-looking, cutting-
edge proposals, without requiring in-depth implementation
and evaluation.
3. PROGRAM
The BADGERS workshop solicited two kinds of submis-
sions, regular papers and work-in-progress papers. Regular
papers do not exceed 8 pages, excluding well-marked ap-
pendixes, while work-in-progress papers do not exceed two
pages, both in the ACM publication format.
The program consists of four invited talks and four tech-
nical papers. The invited talks are split between authors
from US government organizations and private companies,
thus providing a diverse set of views and opinions on the
importance of Big Data for security and privacy. The four
technical papers cover a broad spectrum of topics, from an-
alyzing world-wide intrusions, to Internet-scale darknets, to
privacy in location-based social networks, and vulnerability
scoring systems. In combination, the invited talks and tech-
nical papers provide the starting points for insightful debates
about the role and scope of Big Data in computer security
research.
4. ORGANIZATION
Steering Committee. The BADGERS workshop is orga-
nized under the guidance of its steering committee, consist-
ing of the following members from both academic and com-
mercial organizations. I would like to thank for their help
and support in shaping the focus of this year’s workshop.
