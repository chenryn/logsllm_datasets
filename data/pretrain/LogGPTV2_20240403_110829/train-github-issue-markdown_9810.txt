**Describe the current behavior**  
I have a Standalone c++ build process for ubuntu and it works fine with my own
code as well as with the c++ example code on tensorflow.
But when i run the same code on CentOS platform. I get following runtime error
message and the executable core dumps:
    2019-07-11 10:20:42.027023: F tensorflow/core/framework/function.cc:1329] Check failed: GetOpGradFactory()->insert({op, func}).second Duplicated gradient for MapAccumulate
    Aborted (core dumped)
My compilation command is as:
    g++ -std=gnu++11 -Wl,-rpath='$ORIGIN/lib' -fPIC -Iinclude -Llib  example.cc -ltensorflow_cc -ltensorflow_framework   -o example
