User: I am thinking about using Google App Engine.It is going to be a huge website. In that case, what is your piece of advice using Google App Engine. I heard GAE has restrictions like we cannot store images or files more than 1MB limit(they are going to change this from what I read in the GAE roadmap),query is limited to 1000 results, and I am also going to se web2py with GAE. So I would like to know your comments. 
Thanks
Assistant: What about Google Wave?  It's being built on appengine, and once live, real-time translatable chat reaches the corporate sector...  I could see it hitting top 1000th...  But then again, that's an internal project that gets to do special stuff other appengine apps can't....  Like hanging threads; I think...  And whatever else Wave has under the hood...
