I am considering using Google App Engine (GAE) for a large-scale website. Given the scale, I would appreciate any advice on using GAE. I understand that GAE has certain restrictions, such as a 1MB limit on stored images or files (although this is expected to change according to the GAE roadmap), and a query limit of 1000 results. Additionally, I plan to use web2py with GAE. 

Could you provide some insights and recommendations based on these considerations?

Thank you.

Certainly! When considering Google App Engine (GAE) for a large-scale website, it's important to be aware of its limitations and how they might impact your project. Here are a few key points to consider:

1. **File Size Limitations**: Currently, GAE restricts file storage to 1MB per file. However, as you mentioned, this limit is expected to increase in the future. For now, if you need to store larger files, you can use Google Cloud Storage, which integrates well with GAE and does not have the same size restrictions.

2. **Query Limits**: The 1000-result limit per query can be a constraint. To work around this, you can implement pagination or use cursors to fetch results in smaller, manageable chunks. This approach ensures that your application remains responsive and efficient.

3. **Using web2py with GAE**: web2py is a powerful and flexible web framework, and it can be used with GAE. However, you may need to make some adjustments to ensure compatibility. Make sure to review the web2py documentation and any community resources for best practices when deploying to GAE.

4. **Scalability and Performance**: GAE is designed to scale automatically, which is a significant advantage for large websites. Ensure that your application is optimized for this environment by following best practices for performance, such as minimizing database queries and using caching effectively.

5. **Cost Considerations**: As your website grows, so will your costs. Be sure to monitor and manage your resource usage to avoid unexpected expenses. GAE provides tools and metrics to help you keep track of your spending.

Overall, GAE is a robust platform for building scalable web applications, but it's essential to be mindful of its constraints and to plan accordingly. If you need more flexibility, you might also consider other Google Cloud services, such as Compute Engine or Kubernetes Engine, which offer more control over the infrastructure.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
