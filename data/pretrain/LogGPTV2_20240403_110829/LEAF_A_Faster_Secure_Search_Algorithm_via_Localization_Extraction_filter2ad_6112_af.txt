protocol is approximately the same, which is why LEAF+ algorithm
performs better when 𝑛 is large.
7 EVALUATION
In this section, we empirically evaluate our algorithm.
Experimental Setup. We implement the secure search algorithm
based on the open source homomorphic encryption library SEAL
(version 3.4.5) [27]. SEAL is a widely used HE library written in C++
and it implements two HE schemes, i.e., BFV [15] and CKKS [9].
We use the BFV implementation since CKKS works better with
fixed-point arithmetics while we only need Boolean operations for
our search algorithm. We run our algorithms on a server equipped
with Debian 10 (Buster) and Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E7-8867 v3 @
2.50GHz, 1, 536 GigaByte of RAM. The state-of-the-art AGHL algo-
rithm [2] is used as our baseline model. For fairness, no optimization
technique is used for these two algorithms, like “batching”.
Results. Figure 9 shows the results. Since our algorithm mainly
improves the searching part of the whole protocol, we conduct
our experiments in two scenarios. First, we measure the time cost
of the searching process alone, i.e., without matching, as shown
in Figure 9(a), this could give us a direct impression of how our
improvement works on the searching part. Second, we add the
matching part back and see the total improvement, the result is
shown in Figure 9(b). According to the experimental results, we
conclude that improving the searching process indeed significantly
accelerates the whole protocol. Note that in both scenarios, we
set error rate 𝜀 = 2−80, and we assume the keyword’s length is
𝜇 = 16-bits.
As shown by our formal analysis, our algorithm requires around
double depth compared to AGHL, this makes our multiplications
slower. According to our evaluation, the time cost per multiplication
operation for our algorithm is around 4.17 times higher than AGHL.
On the other hand, our algorithm requires a much less number of
operations. Specifically, our algorithm only requires 2√
𝑛 times
RS-OR operation while AGHL requires 𝑛 times RS-OR operation.
This drives our algorithm much faster than AGHL in general.
The searching algorithm alone starts to perform better than
AGHL when 𝑛 is greater than 80, and the entire protocol outper-
forms the previous algorithm when 𝑛 ≥ 400. According to our
formal analysis in Section 5.2, the advantage of our algorithm will
increase further with the increase of the number of records 𝑛, not
only for the searching part but also for the entire protocol.
8 FURTHER OPTIMIZATION
Single instruction multiple data (SIMD) is an optimization tech-
nique proposed by Smart-Vercauteren[28], this technique allows us
(a) pure searching
(b) searching and matching
Figure 9: Server’s running time as a function of the number of records 𝑛. In the left figure, we show the time cost of the search
process, and in the right one, we depict the time consumption of the whole secure search, i.e., searching and matching. The
results show our work could achieve better efficiency even for a small number of records.
to pack many plaintext elements in a single ciphertext and apply
operations to them at the same time. Plaintext values in a single
ciphertext are referred to as “plaintext slots” of that ciphertext.
We can use SIMD technology as an optimization tool, it is worth
noting that the selection of parameters will be a little different after
using this method. Since SIMD technique operates on the elements
in the slot simultaneously, we should choose the appropriate pa-
rameters so that the technique can be better combined with the
size of the segments we are dividing.
Therefore, when using this optimization technique, further pa-
rameter analysis is very important. We need to carry out detailed
analysis to weigh the multiple parallelism caused by more slots
against the single operation inefficiencies caused by more slots.
9 RELATED WORK
Secure Pattern Matching (SPM): The task of SPM is to deter-
mine whether the plaintext corresponding to the two encrypted
ciphertext meets certain conditions. Specifically, given an encrypted
lookup value, it returns a vector of 𝑛 ciphertexts (𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑛), where
𝑐𝑖 indicates whether the 𝑖th data element is a match to the lookup
value (or sometimes returning only a YES/NO answer of whether a
match exists). There are many works about SPM on FHE encrypted
data, see [11, 12, 20, 21, 23, 31, 33] for details. The main drawback of
these protocols is that the communication complexity and client’s
running time are proportional to the number of stored elements.
Private Information Retrieval (PIR): PIR is a useful protocol to
retrieve at most a single record 𝑥𝑖 in the encrypted array (as in SQL
UNIQUE constraint), it provides a restricted search functionality,
where the client’s lookup value must be a unique identier. Low
degree polynomials realizing secure data retrieval for these unique
identifier settings have been shown in prior works (see [5, 14, 16]).
We note that the server’s run-time in a single server PIR (whether
or not FHE based) is inherently linear in the size of dataset (𝑛). This
protocol provides only a restricted search functionality, which is
incompatible in our setting.
Private Set Intersection (PSI): PSI refers to a setting where two
parties each hold a set of private items and wish to learn the inter-
section of their sets without revealing any additional information
except for the intersection itself. The most efficient works are shown
in [7, 22, 24, 25], however, the protocol is inefficient in the sense of
its communication complexity is at least linear dependence on the
smaller database size (𝑛).
Searchable Encryption (SE): SE enables highly efficient search
over encrypted data. Specifically, SE focuses on achieving sublinear
search time. There are two main primitives for searchable encryp-
tion: searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) [30] and public key
encryption with keyword search (PEKS) [3]. However, the security
is weakened to leak vital search information, like access pattern.
10 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm – LEAF (and its
variants LEAF+ ) – with low communication complexity for FHE-
based secure search. Our scheme relies on three novel techniques
including localization, extraction, and reconstruction. LEAF only
requires the client to encrypt the lookup value and upload it to
the server, and the server will return the encrypted coordinates
corresponding to the matching items in the encrypted database.
In the whole process, the client only needs to encrypt the lookup
value and decrypt the output, which enables our algorithm to be
deployed on weak-power devices and embedded systems.
The security of the protocol is guaranteed by the semantic se-
curity feature of FHE. The server could only access the encrypted
data in the whole process, so the data privacy is enhanced. LEAF
can be performed over 𝐺𝐹(2), which fits all current homomorphic
encryption algorithm. Meanwhile, our algorithm can support un-
restricted search function, which greatly expands its application
scenarios.

Appendices
A SEQUENTIAL RETRIEVAL
In the main body, we provide a faster secure search algorithm that
takes as input an encrypted array, consisting of encrypted 0s and 1s,
and produces as output the first 1’s index and its corresponding item.
For completeness, we recall from Akavia et al. [2] how to extend
secure search functionality to return the rest matching elements.
Assume that we have obtained the first match’s index, say 𝑖, and
want to retrieve the second matching. The intuition is that once
we set the first non-zero term to 0, the second non-zero term now
becomes the first in the original encrypted array, so one just applies
the secure search algorithm and repeats the above process.
It’s not very hard to set the first non-zero term in the original
array to 0, since we obtain this encrypted binary array by applying
the matching method on each item in the database, we can change
the original matching criteria by adding additional requirement, i.e.,
output 1 if and only if the item in the database meets the following
two conditions simultaneously:
• The item satisfies the original matching condition;
• The item’s index is greater than 𝑖 (the first matching’s index);
Then, apply this new matching method to the database to obtain
a new encrypted binary array, which differs only in that the first
non-zero term in the original array is set to 0. More details are found
in Akavia et al.’s work [2], which takes the same time complexity
(𝑂(𝑛)) as a normal exact matching in the asymptotic sense.
To our best knowledge, retrieval following matching needs fur-
ther interaction as we have to send the encrypted index 𝑖 to the
server and need to rerun the matching and searching algorithms,
which is time-consuming. However, at the same time it makes
adversary infeasible to find out the number of matchings in the
database, since the client can choose whether to continue fetching
the next matching or not, which enhances the privacy.
