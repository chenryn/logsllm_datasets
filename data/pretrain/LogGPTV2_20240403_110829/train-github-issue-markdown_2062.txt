I am calling a service like this:
    import requests
    resp = requests.get('http://example.com/some/url', params={'id': 1})
The service responds with a series of 302 redirects.  
I am seeing this exchange.
    client> GET /some/url?id=1 HTTP/1.1
    client> Host: example.com
    server GET /some/url?id=1&extra_data=2&[('id', 1)] HTTP/1.1.
    client> Host: example.com
    # the server of course doesn't like it
    server< HTTP/1.0 400 Bad request.
Any ideas why this may be happening?
