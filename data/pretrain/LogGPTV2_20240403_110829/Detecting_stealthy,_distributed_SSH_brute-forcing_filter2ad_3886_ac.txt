### Figure 8: Participating Attack Hosts in Distributed Attacks (2005-2012) at LBNL

Figure 8 illustrates the participation of attack hosts in various distributed attacks detected at LBNL from 2005 to 2012. Each host is assigned a unique number, starting from 1 for the first observed host. The significant overlap of attack hosts across different attack episodes indicates that many of these attacks are likely orchestrated by the same botnet.

### Figure 9: Overlap of Attack Hosts Across Sites

Figure 9 shows the percentage overlap of attack hosts detected at LBNL with those observed at other sites, specifically HONEY, CAMPOFF, and RSRCHLAB. This figure only includes attacks that appeared in at least one of the three sites. Notably, none of the attacks were detected at HOMEOFF. The high overlap in most cases suggests that the same attackers or botnets are often involved in multiple attacks across different sites.

### Figure 7: Span of Detected Attack Epochs

Figure 7 presents the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the span of detected attack epochs. These coordinated attacks frequently span multiple days and sometimes multiple weeks. Most attacks exhibit strong coordination, either through the set of local machines probed or the usernames targeted for brute-forcing. Out of the 90 true attack epochs, 62 showed common-set-of-local-machines glue, and 25 showed username-“root” glue. Only 3 epochs did not show any identifiable coordination; these probed a wide range of addresses and used generic usernames like "mysql" and "admin."

### Analysis of Attack Coordination and Campaigns

To consolidate the set of attack epochs into campaigns, we used the following rules:
1. **Common-Set-of-Local-Machines Glue:** Epochs with the same set of local machines.
2. **Username-Root Glue on the Same Day:** Epochs appearing on the same day with "root" as the targeted username.

Using these rules, we grouped the 62 attacks with common-set-of-local-machines glue into 12 distinct attack campaigns. A few of the 25 epochs with username-root glue were grouped, resulting in 20 campaigns. In total, we identified 35 distinct attack campaigns.

### Table 4: Summary of Attack Characteristics

Table 4 summarizes the magnitude, scope, and stealthiness of the detected attacks. All attacks were stealthy when viewed from the perspective of individual hosts, with an average of approximately 2 attempts per local machine per hour. We could detect a large fraction of these campaigns using a point-wise network-based detector that looks for high-rate hourly activity in terms of failed attempts or the number of local hosts contacted. Additionally, we detected some attacks that would have been missed by both host-based and network-based point-wise detection (e.g., campaigns 5, 7, and 8 in Table 4). Two of the campaigns succeeded, with the first (campaign 1) going undetected by the site.

### Differences in Attack Characteristics

We observed differences between attacks with set-of-local-machines coordination glue and those with only username-root glue. The latter tended to target a wide range of the site’s address space and often involved just a few attack hosts brute-forcing at a high rate. Attacks with set-of-local-machines coordination glue often exhibited a pattern of stopping and resuming. There was no sequential pattern in the targeted servers, which were spread across the address space, including both of LBNL’s distinct address blocks. No pattern was found among the local servers in terms of belonging to the same research group or compute cluster.

### Establishing the Scope of Attacks

To determine whether attacks specifically targeted LBNL or were part of global, indiscriminate probing, we checked if the attack hosts appeared in our four correlation datasets: HONEY, RSRCHLAB, HOMEOFF, and CAMPOFF. We found that 16 campaigns appeared in at least one of these datasets, including five with username-root coordination glue and all but one with set-of-local-machines coordination. Figure 9 shows a high overlap in attack hosts for most of these campaigns.

Campaign 5, which did not appear in any other dataset, was confirmed to target LBNL, as the attack hosts probed a set of six valid usernames at the site. This targeted attack also proceeded stealthily, with each remote host making an average of only 9 attempts and contacting 3 local servers per hour. Some other campaigns may have specifically targeted LBNL, but we lack definitive evidence for this.

### Nature of Global Attacks

Figure 10 shows the timing patterns of login attempts at LBNL and HONEY during part of campaign 8. The clear correlation, albeit with a time lag, indicates that the activity at both sites reflects the same rate and active/inactive periods.

### Conclusion

In this work, we propose a general approach for detecting distributed, potentially stealthy activity at a site. The method is based on detecting changes in a site-wide parameter that summarizes aggregate activity. We applied this approach to detect stealthy distributed SSH brute-forcing activity, showing that the process of legitimate user activity can be distinguished from malicious activity.
