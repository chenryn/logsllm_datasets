User: I getting the below issue when firing up django or ipython notebook
/opt/bitnami/python/bin/.python2.7.bin: error while loading shared libraries: libreadline.so.5
However libreadline.so.5 exists in my system after locating it as shown below
root@linux:/opt/bitnami/scripts# locate libreadline.so.5
/opt/bitnami/common/lib/libreadline.so.5
/opt/bitnami/common/lib/libreadline.so.5.2
I have also exported the path in the environment variable (where the libreadlive.so.5 is located) but still does'nt seems to be resolving my issue (see below)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$HOME/opt/bitnami/common/lib
Also there is a script which is being provided by bitnami which is located in /opt/bitnami/scripts/setenv.sh. But even after executing it still i am stuck.
Anyone can help me with this
Assistant: Can you execute the following and see if it solves your issue?
. /opt/bitnami/scripts/setenv.sh 
(notice the space between the dot and the path to the script)
Also what are you executing that gives you that error?
