**Issue Type:** Feature Idea  
**Ansible Version:** 1.9.1  
**Ansible Configuration:** nothing changed

**Summary:**  
I'm trying to keep some software installed into a non-standard directory.
Currently using the yum module I can't specify an alternative installroot

I would like to be able to add --installroot option like I can do this with
yum in linux.
