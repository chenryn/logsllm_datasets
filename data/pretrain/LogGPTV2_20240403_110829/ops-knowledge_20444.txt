I have created a Docker image that includes Python libraries and Jupyter. To start the container, I use the `-p 8888:8888` option to map the ports between the host and the container.

When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container using the command `jupyter notebook`, it runs on `localhost:8888` but does not automatically open a browser. 

**Question:** What is the IP address I should use from my host machine to access Jupyter in the host's browser?

**Answer:**

1. **Start the Docker Container:**
   ```sh
   docker run -it -p 8888:8888 <image-name>:<version>
   ```

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook Inside the Container:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
   ```
   - `--ip 0.0.0.0`: Binds Jupyter to all available network interfaces.
   - `--no-browser`: Prevents Jupyter from trying to open a web browser.
   - `--allow-root`: Allows Jupyter to run as the root user.

3. **Access Jupyter from the Host Machine:**
   - Open a web browser on your host machine and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:8888/tree
     ```
   - When you first log in, a token will be displayed in the terminal. Use this token to authenticate and access Jupyter.

**Additional Information:**
- You can find the IP addresses of your network interfaces on the host machine using the `ifconfig` command. Common interfaces include `eth0`, `docker0`, `wlan0`, and `lo`. However, for local access, `localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) is typically used.

Thank you!
