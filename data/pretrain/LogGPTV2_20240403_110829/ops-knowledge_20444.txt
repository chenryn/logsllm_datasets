User: I created a docker image with python libraries and Jupyter. 
I start the container with the option -p 8888:8888, to link ports between host and container. 
When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container, it is running on localhost:8888 (and does not find a browser). I used the command jupyter notebook
But from my host, what is the IP address I have to use to work with Jupyter in host's browser ? 
With the command ifconfig, I find eth0, docker, wlan0, lo ...
Thanks !
Assistant: Host machine: docker run -it -p 8888:8888 image:version 
Inside the Container : jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root 
Host machine access this url : localhost:8888/tree‌​
