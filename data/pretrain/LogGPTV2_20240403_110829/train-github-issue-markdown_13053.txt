# Environment
Windows build number: **Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.175]**  
Windows Terminal version (if applicable): **0.2.1715.0**
# Steps to reproduce
Open up a new powershell or cmd window and try to enter a @ with a German
layout keyboard. I tried to type the @ char with `ctrl + alt + q` and I did
try it with `AltGr + q` in both cases the behavior is identical.
Seems like the problem is present with the backslash '' as well on a German
keyboard you need to either use `ctrl + alt + ß` or `AltGr + ß` to get the
char in any other application.
Since I can ctrl + c my command the alt key should be the problem or the
combination.
It is possibly to copy the char if you type it into the editor and paste it
with a click of the right mouse button. This is a workaround for the moment.
# Expected behavior
The correct char is getting displayed
# Actual behavior
In the powershell no char will be shown  
in the command line the letter `q` or `ß` is getting displayed
