impact...”
of circumstances was entirely outside the scope and 
control of Art Center and many of the partners in the 
consortium, it is important to recognize that it is also 
part-and-parcel of practicing public sector design, 
which by definition is grounded in the context of what 
sometimes can be experienced as the frustrating 
slower pace of decision-making at the policy level.
CONCLUSION
At the core of every Designmatters at Art Center 
educational project collaboration is the fundamental 
belief that good design brings value to society— with 
the potential of especially transformative impact in 
the context of “wicked” problems and ingrained social 
inequities.   The Teen Art Park project provides an 
important case study.  The collaborative framework 
it offers exemplifies in many ways bottom-up social 
innovation as defined by the DESIS Collaborative 
and Public Sector cluster, and showcases a platform 
“to trigger, enable and support active collaborative 
behavior on the part of citizens.”11 
As one of the design teams articulated, the Teen 
Art Park project is envisioned “to be a place for 
transformation, where you could become the best 
version of who you can possibly be.”12 Today, that 
aspiration and relentless commitment to collaborate 
in order to serve some of the most vulnerable 
and promising youth in the community continues 
confidently driving the Teen Art Park project forward.

IMPLICATIONS FOR: 
DESIGN PRACTICE
Design for Social Sustainability is a framework for creating thriving new com-
munities.  The current tools and metrics to foster urban development are bi-
ased  toward  environmental  and  economic  sustainability.   The Teen Art  Park 
Project exemplifies an example that strives for the social sustainability that the 
Young Foundation’s Future Communities program calls for.
DESIGN EDUCATION
Embracing participatory design research approaches and co-design in the cur-
riculum is essential in community design initiatives that aspire to add value to 
the community.  Performing active listening, developing a two-way street for 
learning with, and from users, and establishing trust among partners are para-
mount goals of real engaged social impact design education.
POLICYMAKING
Planning, designing and developing successful and socially sustainable com-
munities require that the mechanisms and policies be in place for residents to 
be able to shape their own physical surroundings.

COLLABORATIVE DESIGN STRATEGIES:  
HELPING TO CHANGE THE PRACTICE OF CARE
Kristin Hughes, Peter Scupelli
ABSTRACT
Over the past four decades the number of obese children in the US has increased dramatically. Yet, physicians 
still find it difficult to address issues of weight and health with young patients and their families during annual 
well-child check-ups. Physicians have few resources to help them overcome the barriers of time, perceived 
ineffectiveness and uncomfortable confrontation in order to have effective discussions with their patients. 
Using a design-lead approach we help physicians aid conversations around obesity prevention. This highly 
participatory, transparent approach in-turn purposefully educated and motivated physicians to change their 
perception on effective ways to deliver health education to their patients. This process informed the design of 
a product and service known as Fitwits MD. Our paper argues that scaffolds are necessary in determining the 
sustainability and evolution of a product and/or service. Illustrated examples show the efforts of physicians 
who initiated and co-designed new products, services and policies to improve their own lives and those of their 
patients. We describe the design process, dissemination, and evaluation linked to the making and development 
of Fitwits MD.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is an escalating problem in the United 
States. In the last quarter century, the prevalence 
of obesity in children and adolescents has tripled. 
Recent data from the Center for Disease Control 
(Ogden and Carroll 2012) estimates that an alarming 
17% of children and adolescents are obese and 
33% of children aged 6-11 years are overweight 
or obese. Many physicians feel unsuited by lack of 
training and the absence of an effective strategy to 
discuss child obesity prevention and improvement 
(Perrin et al. 2005). In a 2005 Ambulatory Pediatrics 
article reporting a survey of North Carolina 
pediatricians, only 12% providing routine office care 
felt high self-efficacy in counseling about childhood 
obesity; 39% felt that they could be effective with 
improved training and tools. Physicians also feel 
exceedingly pressed for time during the expected full 
responsibilities of a well-child care visit. Physician 
organizations and national agencies stress the 
importance of better health messaging, annual body 
mass index (BMI) assessment and related counseling 
during well-child visits. However, a minority of family 
physicians and pediatricians feel prepared to provide 
this counseling. Physicians and health educators alike 
have been looking for evidence-based educational 
programs to assist in broaching the subject of obesity 
with their patients (McGaffey et al. 2011). As noted 
by a local pediatrician, “A pediatrician’s number one 
clinical dilemma is how to counsel families about 
preventing and managing childhood obesity”. In fact, 
it is a dilemma for all who provide routine childcare 
(McGaffey et al. 2011).
WHAT IS FITWITS?
Fitwits advocates for improved health education and 
resources in all facets of individuals’ lives and has been 
designed to reduce counseling barriers, to educate, 
and to stimulate conversations between children, 
parents, teachers and healthcare providers. Fitwits is 
a system of games, educational products and services 
that enable kids, and their family’s opportunities to 
adopt and maintain healthier lifestyles. At the heart 
of the brand are novel cartoon characters called the 
Fitwits and Nitwits. The Fitwits epitomize healthy 
foods and model good lifestyle choices, like physical 
activities. The Nitwits typify unhealthy food choices 
and the struggle to make better health decisions. 
The novelty of Fitwits makes teaching and learning 
about health fun. It is designed to create interesting 
hybrid experiences merging technology with hands-on 
learning by allowing people of all ages the opportunity 
to interact with one another, ask questions, make 
decisions, and “try-on” new health behaviors. The 
Fitwits Program grew out of concern for the lack of 
available health related resources used to encourage 
Fitwits advocates for 
improved health education 
and resources in all facets 
of individuals’ lives has 
been designed to reduce 
counseling barriers, to 
educate, and to stimulate 
conversations between 
children, parents, teachers, 
and healthcare providers. 
and enable positive lifestyle changes. 
In this paper we describe one aspect of the Fitwits 
Program in which designers worked with family-
medicine, pediatric care physicians, dieticians and 
their patients in an effort to design an effective tool 
to be used during well-child visits with their 9-12 year 
old patients and families. During the early stages of 
our initial investigation we learned that preventative 
care for obesity related illness has been known to 
increase patient health literacy (Hughes et al. 2009). 
Health literacy is often narrowly defined as a method 
of dissemination for use when making health decisions 
(Peerson and Saunders 2009), but recently health 
experts have observed a greater effectiveness of health 
communications’ potential positive impact when 
people directly interact with and use the messages in 
order to change or take action to improve their health.
PARTICIPATING IN THE DESIGN PROCESS
When asked, “What are the boundaries of design?” 
Charles Eames replied, “What are the boundaries of 
128
problems?” (Eames et al.1989). The general boundaries 
of obesity prevention described in this paper include 
health literacy, co-creation and adaptable co-design 
practices. The particular boundaries are tied to the 
context and the actors involved in obesity prevention. 
A collaborative and transparent design process is one 
that allows the community of use to not only be part 
of the initial discussion and emergence of the design, 
but that asks them to take ownership of the process 
and resulting design solution(s) and to adopt overtime 
as need arises. 
Co-creation is challenging 
because both designers 
and in our case, medical 
professionals are  
called to work outside of 
their area of expertise.
DEFINING CO-CREATION
Co-creation happens when designers and non-
designers are engaged and encouraged to participate 
in the design process. The role of the design team in 
a co-creation process is to create hands-on design 
activities that encourage participation and open 
engagement in a workshop like setting. The design 
activities are ordered to:
• 
• 
Offer authorship opportunities
Build trust between the participants and design 
team 
Acquire local knowledge and skills
Iterate and refine the problem definition
Learn about local community values, culture and 
practice
Affords the designer the opportunity to enter 
into the problem space without a pre-determined 
outcome
• 
• 
• 
• 
Co-creation is challenging because both designers 
and in our case, medical professionals are called to 
work outside of their area of expertise. Designers 
must acquire medical domain knowledge (e.g., related 
medical research, clinical practice) while physicians 
are asked to participate in conceiving, making 
and prototyping future products and/or services, 
129
iteratively beta testing them, and then integrating 
varied prototypes into their practice. Specific to our 
process, it was highly beneficial that physician staff 
participated in design workshops. Without their 
expertise, challenges specific to a medical educational 
program, such as a physician-training program, 
would have been difficult to ascertain. The task for 
the design team was to work alongside healthcare 
practitioners to articulate the difficulties they 
encounter in their practices and construct a framework 
for communicating the essentials of obesity prevention 
both visually and in simple language. 
In order to get to this stage we needed to better 
understand what and for whom we were designing. 
We ran several participatory design workshops during 
which we helped lead participants through activities 
aimed at identifying misused and confusing health 
terminology, illuminating barriers that prevent open 
discussions about obesity with families, pinpointing 
issues they believed were most important to convey 
to patients, and discussing the types of physical aids 
that might help them during such interventions. 
Participants included faculty, a social worker, and a 
librarian from a family medicine residency program 
and family and pediatric physicians who provide 
routine childcare in Pittsburgh communities, along 
with registered dieticians, a faculty member from a 
research university, and four design students.
DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN RESEARCH ACTIVITIES 
AND SYNTHESIS
Our first activity identified barriers to discussing weight, 
nutrition, and exercise with patients. Participants were 
provided with sticky notes identifying many possible 
barriers to in-office counseling. Results showed that the 
two most important barriers are 1.) time constraints 
and 2.) the fact that many patients are unwilling to 
change. Other barriers included patient issues (low 
educational level, denial, lack of interest, and perceived 
benefits of obesity, provider issues (lack of time, lack of 
training or knowledge), and community factors (high 
cost of healthy food, limited access to healthy foods, 
lack of role models). 
We then asked participants to help write definitions 
for nine health-related terms. The word lists included 
a wide range of definitions, euphemisms for potentially 
offensive words, and misused terms. Participants 
provided a surprisingly large range of answers for 
most of the terms and seemed to have varying degrees 
of understanding about many of the terms and 
reasons for why they would use, for example, the word 
“overweight” versus the word “obese.” Many doctors 
defined “obesity” and “weight problem” using a Body 
Mass Index (BMI) classification. Some explained that 
they prefer to use the terms “overweight” or “weight 
problem” with children to avoid “obesity,” which they 
deemed an offensive term; one even shied away from 
saying “problem.” The most important terms were also 
the hardest to define and describe, again pointing to 
a communication breakdown between physicians and 
patients during health education discussions. Clinical 
expertise did not translate into ability to consistently 
and simply impart knowledge to patients.
Participants were then split into “doctor-patient” pairs 
to role-play an encounter between a 9-to-12-year-old 
attending a well-child check-up and his/her doctor. 
Prior to the workshop, the design team developed two, 
three-minute scenarios. In the first, doctors received 
cue cards to help prompt questions regarding health 
and nutrition. In the second, we provided a “physician 
tool” to the doctor roles. After each scenario, roles 
were reversed and participants switched partners. 
We ran each scenario twice. Many doctors made little 
progress in the allotted time, often starting slowly 
and awkwardly by asking patients about favorite 
things they like to do at school and making light 
conversation. Participants were engaged but had 
trouble speaking confidently about obesity, continually 
reverting back to confusing “doctor speak.” Participants 
noted that this activity was a good opportunity for 
them to practice under a time constraint, a major 
barrier identified earlier. And, although not planned 
what emerged in our discussions with workshop 
participants was the need to look at the larger systems 
that would ensure our product would be used. It 
was clear that intra- and inter-office leadership and 
coordination are necessary to ensure participation, 
understanding and use. 
PARTICIPANT REFLECTIONS
Several months after the workshops the design team 
ask participants to reflect on the following topics: 
1) their perceived agency over co-created health 
communications, 2) the role of physicians as designers, 
and 3) effectiveness of a “training the trainer” method.
One physician noted how her perspective of design 
changed through her experience of the participatory
