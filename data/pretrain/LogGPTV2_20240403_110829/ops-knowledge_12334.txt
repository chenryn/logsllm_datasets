User: How to perform network traffic analysis and monitor network traffic? Please provide the corresponding tools and techniques.
Assistant: Network traffic analysis and monitoring is one of the important steps in maintaining network security. Here are tools and tips for doing network traffic analysis and monitoring network traffic. Tools: 1. Wireshark: It is a network protocol analysis software that can capture and analyze network data packets, and supports various protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, etc. 2. tcpdump: It is a command-line packet capture tool that can capture and analyze network packets and supports various protocols such as TCP, UDP, IP, etc. 3. Snort: It is a network and host-based intrusion detection and prevention system that can detect and defend against various network attacks. 4. ntopng: It is a network traffic monitoring tool that supports functions such as network traffic analysis and real-time monitoring. 5. NetFlow Analyzer: It is a network traffic analysis tool that can monitor network traffic, generate reports and alerts, etc. Tips: 1. Understand the network structure: Knowing the network structure can better identify and locate network problems, and facilitate network traffic analysis and monitoring. 2. Capture target data packets: For target data packets that need to be analyzed, tools such as Wireshark can be used to capture and analyze them. 3. Analyze network traffic: analyze the captured data packets, analyze the source address, destination address, port number and other information of the data packets, so as to identify network problems. 4. Real-time monitoring of network traffic: Network traffic monitoring tools can be used to monitor network traffic in real time and generate reports and alarms, so as to discover and solve problems in time. 5. Establish baseline data: Establish baseline data to help analyze changes in network traffic to better identify anomalies.
