When you want the FlashBag to set a message, you'd like to do getFlashBag on
the session. However, you can only achieve this by type hinting an injection
on the Session\Session object. The Session\SessionInterface doesn't contain
the "getFlashBag" method thus you can't use the Request::getSession();
If you do want to get the flash bag from it, you can try
"getSession()->getBag('flash bag name')". However, that doesn't guarantee that
you get the flash bag that was inserted because you don't know the name.
It's a minor inconvenience that has multiple custom solutions, but I've seen
this issue come around a couple of times already in "#symfony".
