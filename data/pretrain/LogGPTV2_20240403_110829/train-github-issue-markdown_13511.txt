## Expected Behavior
When I use auto layout the grid items must not go outside of the grid.
It is expected that the container outside the grid defines max width possible.
When Grid items have `xs` property with no value, all columns align
automatically.
(This is what I get from the demo docs).
## Current Behavior
I created an example here -  
https://codesandbox.io/s/1ow4q5557l
The text is going out of bounds because the second Grid Item (column) is
bigger that what it should be.
## Context
Unable to align the items correctly.
Note what I have pasted in codesandbox is simplified code. In my actual grid
item there are many more typography elements so I cannot fallback to using the
"List" component.
If I am using this incorrectly then please let me know.
