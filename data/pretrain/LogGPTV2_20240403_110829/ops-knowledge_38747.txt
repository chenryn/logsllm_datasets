User: How to conduct a network security assessment? Please explain the basic process and precautions of penetration testing.
Assistant: 1. Methods of network security assessment 1. Active scanning: use the specified scanning tool to scan the target computer to understand system vulnerabilities and weaknesses, so as to determine the vulnerabilities and unauthorized access points that can be exploited by attackers. 2. Black-box evaluation: Evaluators do not understand the network architecture, rules, and strategies, and conduct penetration tests on the network by simulating external hackers. 3. White box evaluation: Evaluators have a certain understanding of the system architecture, rules and strategies, conduct a comprehensive test on the system, and focus on testing the effectiveness and rationality of the security controls implemented by the system. 2. The basic process of penetration testing 1. Security detection: Use various tools and means to detect all available information and vulnerabilities of the target system. 2. Vulnerabilities Exploitation: Use the discovered vulnerabilities to obtain the administrator privileges of the target system to achieve the purpose of controlling the system. 3. Privilege escalation to expand authority: Use the acquired authority to elevate oneself to a deeper level of authority to achieve complete control over the system. 4. Data theft: Use the obtained permissions to obtain valuable information in the target system, such as databases, files, logs, etc. 5. Erase traces: After the penetration test is completed, clean up the traces to avoid being discovered by the target system administrator. 3. Precautions for penetration testing 1. Before testing, make sure that the testers have been approved by all necessary qualifications, and can only carry out testing after undergoing relevant strict training and assessment. 2. Before the penetration test, make sure to introduce and understand the target system in detail, and analyze its security strategy, network architecture and security environment. 3. During the testing process, it is necessary to strictly abide by the relevant rules, regulations and security risk assessment principles to ensure that the testing has been authorized by relevant administrators and business personnel. 4. During the penetration test, all test findings, weaknesses and loopholes should be accurately recorded, and reported to relevant business managers in a timely manner. 5. After the penetration test is completed, all data and tools generated by the test must be cleared in time to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by hackers. 6. For the test results, it is necessary to sort and classify them in time, and make suggestions or optimization plans to relevant business managers.
