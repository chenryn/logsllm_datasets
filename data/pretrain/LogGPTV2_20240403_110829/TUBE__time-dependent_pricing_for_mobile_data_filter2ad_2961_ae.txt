Figure 12a shows the average change in usage for each user
in Type 1 periods versus Type 3 periods. For both period
types, the color did not change, but the discount in Type 1
periods increased signiﬁcantly. Thus, if users had reacted to
the numerical prices, we would expect usage to increase in
Type 1 and decrease in Type 3 periods: users’ data points
should lie above the reference line. Figure 12a shows that
this is the case with only half of the users. Moreover, some
users increased their usage dramatically in both types of
periods, while most decreased their usage in both types of
periods. Wilcoxon’s test reveals an 82% probability that the
null hypothesis is valid on the diﬀerences in usage changes
in both types of periods: since the indicator color did not
change, users were mostly agnostic to the numerical values
of the discounts.
We next compare these results to those obtained when
the indicator color and discount oﬀered both change. Fig-
ure 12b plots the average change in usage in Type 2 versus
Type 1 periods. The discounts in both periods increased by
comparable amounts, but the indicator color changed from
orange to green only in Type 2 periods. We see that most
users’ data points lie above the reference line, so that usage
increased more (or decreased less) in Type 2 as compared to
Type 1 periods. Wilcoxon’s test yields only a 9.8% probabil-
ity that the null hypothesis is valid on the diﬀerences in us-
age changes in both types of periods. Thus, users responded
to the indicator color despite the comparable numerical dis-
counts.
4.4.4 Beneﬁts of Optimized TDP
Question: Does peak usage decrease with time-dependent
pricing? And does this decrease come at the expense of an
overall decrease in usage?
Method: We oﬀered optimized time-dependent prices to
all users with JB devices over a two week period in Jan-
uary 2012. The waiting functions used to calculate these
prices were estimated from usage data for the static time-
dependent prices. To measure the peak reduction, we cal-
culated the peak-to-average ratio (PAR), i.e., the ratio of
usage in the peak period to average per-period usage, for
each day. We then compared the PARs from our TIP data
to those observed with TUBE’s optimized TDP.
Results: Optimized time-dependent prices reduce the peak-
to-average ratio from TIP usage. Moreover, overall usage
signiﬁcantly increased after TDP was introduced, partially
because people used more in the discounted valley periods.
Figure 13a shows the distribution of daily PARs both be-
fore and after TDP was introduced. The maximum PAR
decreases by 30% with TDP, and approximately 20% of the

(b) Period types 1 and 2.
Figure 12: Changes in usage for the period types in Table 5.
PARs before TDP are larger than the maximum PAR with
TDP. Thus, TDP signiﬁcantly reduced the peak-to-average
ratio, ﬂattening demand over the day.
We next show that this decrease in PAR is not due to
a net loss of traﬃc. Figure 13b shows the peak daily us-
age observed before and after TDP. Though the maximum
peak usage is about the same, peak usage is generally larger
with TDP. Since the PARs also decreased, usage in non-
peak periods increased. In fact, we observe a 130% increase
in usage from TIP to TDP. Part of this increase may be due
to the time of year–we measured the TIP usage from July to
September, and the TDP usage in January. TDP, however,
is likely a major factor: the discounts during oﬀ-peak peri-
ods allowed users to consume more data while still spending
less money and decreasing the PAR.
Finally, we examine the changes in application distribu-
tion due to the introduction of TDP. Figure 13c shows the
average daily usage by application before TDP (i.e., during
our TIP calibration period) and when TDP is introduced.
We see that movie streaming nearly quadrupled, while usage
of other applications stayed about the same. Since stream-
ing is generally used for entertainment, the discounts may
have motivated people to consume more data during low-
price periods. Thus, the “valleys” of TIP usage were further
ﬁlled up by an increase in demand, creating a win-win-win
across end users, ISPs, and content providers.
5. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
We now discuss several limitations of TUBE’s model and
our trial, and then identify future extensions of our work.
Mobility: Since mobile users may switch their base sta-
tions frequently, the proposed TUBE system requires user
devices to keep track of diﬀerent prices across distinct base
stations. However, user mobility can often be predicted from
location history [22]; thus, the user device can predict its lo-
cation over the next day and pull prices from the appropriate
base stations. The device itself can then keep track of the
user’s bill, an approach scalable to many users.
Single bottleneck: Our model assumes a single bottle-
neck in the network. This assumption is consistent with
a wireless base station in an urban area or a middle-mile
bottleneck in rural areas.
Time granularity: Our initial trial uses hour-long pe-
riods, since users are more familiar with hourly prices, but
we can also shrink the periods to, say, 10 minutes. Shorter
time periods allow users to wait less, possibly enhancing
TDP’s eﬀectiveness. If the timescale is further reduced to
several seconds, the autopilot mode on user devices eﬀec-
tively responds to real-time congestion conditions, turning
time-dependent pricing into congestion-dependent pricing.
Trial scale and additional functionalities: Diﬀerent
demographics likely have diﬀerent price and time sensitiv-
ities for mobile data, making our trial only the ﬁrst step
towards understanding TDP’s eﬀectiveness. We are cur-
rently conducting larger-scale trials with U.S. and Indian
ISPs that will further illuminate users’ price-delay tradeoﬀs
and directly test the eﬀect of the autopilot mode.
Control group: While a trial control group is highly
desirable, it is diﬃcult to compare the TDP usage of one
group of users with another control group of TIP users un-
less they are matched properly. Such matching is especially
challenging in a small population of users, as in our trial.
Our planned large-scale trials will address this issue.
6. RELATED WORK
Internet pricing models have been debated since the 1990s.
Several pricing schemes, both static and dynamic, have been
suggested by networking researchers to alleviate congestion.
Static pricing plans charge users according to predetermined
rates without adapting to customers’ usage behavior, e.g.,
metered, ﬂat price, cap then metered, and two-period time
of day pricing plans [17]. Other proposals include Clark’s
Expected Capacity Pricing [3], Cocchi’s Edge Pricing [4],
and Odlyzko’s Paris Metro Pricing [16], with the former two
admitting dynamic versions as well.
Dynamic pricing has the advantage of adapting prices to
the network condition, as shown in Gupta et al.’s Priority
Pricing [7], Hayer’s Transport Auction [9], Kelly et al.’s Pro-
portional Fair Pricing [11], Varian’s Smart Market Pricing
[13], MacKie-Mason et al.’s Responsive Pricing [14], Semret
et al.’s Market Pricing [19], etc. Sen et al.
[20] provides
a detailed overview of these various pricing proposals and
their realization in current data plans. The social and eth-
ical dimensions of dynamic pricing have also been widely
studied, and its consumer adoption and beneﬁts in electric-
ity and transportation networks are well documented [20].
However, there have been no documented trials of dynamic
pricing for mobile data.
7. CONCLUSION
Though time-dependent pricing for mobile data has been
discussed for several decades, no experimental study has
been conducted to investigate a functional prototype. To
this end, we developed and implemented TUBE, an archi-
tecture that takes TDP from economic theory to a system
implementation. TUBE creates a feedback loop between the
ISP’s price computation and users’ ever-changing response
to these prices. To link these components, we estimate and
predict users’ future behavior each day with aggregate usage
data. Users respond to the prices via a GUI that resides on
their devices, either manually or using an autopilot mode.

To conﬁrm TDP’s feasibility, we conduct a trial with 50
iPhone/iPad 3G data plan users, acting as a resale ISP and
charging them according to our TDP algorithms. Our trial
results indicate that people are sensitive to time-dependent
prices and indeed shift their Internet usage to oﬀ-peak peri-
ods, while increasing the monthly total of data usage. TDP
ﬂattens the temporal distribution of user demand for data,
thus reducing ISP cost while allowing users to save money.
This implementation and pilot trial motivates future study
on time-dependent pricing for diﬀerent markets and demo-
graphics.
