**ATT&CK ID:** S0604  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Industroyer

The Industroyer IEC 104 module employs three distinct modes to carry out its attacks: range, shift, and sequence.

### Range Mode
Range mode operates in two stages:
1. **Stage 1:** The module collects Information Object Addresses (IOAs) and sends select and execute packets to toggle the state of these IOAs.
2. **Stage 2:** An infinite loop is initiated, continuously toggling the state of all previously discovered IOAs.

### Shift Mode
Shift mode is similar to range mode but introduces a modification. Instead of operating within the same range, it adds a shift value to the default range values, thereby altering the addresses targeted by the attack.

### Sequence Mode
Sequence mode, though not detailed in the provided information, is another operational mode available in the Industroyer IEC 104 module.

For more detailed information, refer to the source documentation [1].
