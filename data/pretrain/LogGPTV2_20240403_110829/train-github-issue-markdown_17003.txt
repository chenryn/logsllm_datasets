    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. Make a package X.
    2. Write another package Y that (perhaps transitively) depends on X.
    3. Write a test for package X that depends on Y, and have that test be in package X
    (i.e. not in package X_test).
    4. Build and run the test.
    What is the expected output?
    6l should refuse to link the test due to the cycle.
    What do you see instead?
    One of two things:
      - 6l refuses to link the test due to "linker skew", or
      - 6l links the test, and the resultant test binary ends up initialising package X twice.
    Which compiler are you using (5g, 6g, 8g, gccgo)?
    6g/6l.
    Which operating system are you using?
    Linux.
