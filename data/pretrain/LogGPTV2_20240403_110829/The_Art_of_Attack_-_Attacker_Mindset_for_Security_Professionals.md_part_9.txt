the screen, with the evildoer sweating and staring at it until it flashes
“100%.” But whatever it looks like, I’d want to see it and know the
attack was complete and a success. That was not possible on this job
because I performed the attack via a series of vishing calls.
Putting the phone down after being assured too many dollars to
disclose were indeed in the ether, on the way to my account, made
that particular night a long one. Thankfully, although not for the
security of the bank, the ungodly sum did show up in the account
it was supposed to. Thanks to its appearance, I got to write a very
detailed report. I also got to keep the original account’s balance of
zero dollars and zero cents afterward.
The two fundamentals to look at when forming an attack are
your objectives and what your cover story will be. Working back-
ward from the question at the top of that list, though, is a strong
linear sequence that helps answer both. It will help you decide the
equipment you require, as well as the number of people you need
to execute the job. It also helps optimize other things, such as the
time of day you should attack and the number of people needed
to achieve the objective (economy of force) and how will they be
used? Some might be at the physical location, whereas others are
not physically there but instead in the network.
I had considered all of these things as I entered a very prestig-
ious building in New York to, essentially, begin robbing it.
68 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Robbing a Bank
Robbing a bank is no easy feat, even if you are a pro. Where we last
left off on this story in chapter one, I’d met with my team; I’d drunk
copious amounts of hot chocolate because, apparently, I hated
myself around that time and was trying to abstain from coffee. The
team and I had gone over the plan until it felt like the words were
meaningless and melding together, looked over the floor plans that
we’d come into possession of through some very nifty OSINT, and
looked over some of the interior pictures people had put on Face-
book when they’d “checked in” for meetings, and so on. We were
keeping to our plan of sending me in first, with all of us returning
that same night. We were ready.
After doing some final checks on our communication meth-
ods (primary and backup), I was soon walking from our temporary
office in the city to the target’s main building. I knew the security
surrounding the information and asset I was aiming to get to was
mainly in the form of humans, which can often be a pesky hurdle.
There was also going to be security in the form of technology. I knew
from pictures I’d found online that there were motorized turnstiles,
also pesky because they generally beep obnoxiously when you jump
over them. But, as I told myself then and believe now, humans are
often distrustful of technology, which is one way to neutralize both.
As I made my way toward the revolving doors, the mental
games of chess I’d had been running in my mind up until that point
ceased. I was only going over the details of my pretext now: Law-
yer. Merger. Documents. Appointment. Late to meeting I knew had
already started. Rinse and repeat.
I walked inside looking to the reception desk, stretched out
somewhat menacingly over the sterile- seeming foyer. I almost
stopped dead in my tracks. It took every bit of self- discipline not
to look around in search of what I had always imagined I’d find
upon entering the prestigious lobby of a well- known, reputable
bank. There was no guard. There was ostensibly no security person-
nel present.
The Laws 69
My initial feeling was one of relief—t his meant that there was
no one to stop me. Mere milliseconds later my brain was throwing
me a curveball in the form of paranoia. If security wasn’t at the
desk, were they watching me from the sky? Stopping myself from a
360º spin to check for any security in my general vicinity, I imme-
diately curved to the right as if it had been my intention all the
time and headed for the turnstiles. I reached into my pocket as if
this was not the first time in my life I was pulling this card from it
and scanned it on the machine’s reader. As if I expected it to open,
I pushed my briefcase into the glass doors of the turnstile that, for
the people who actually had access, would’ve normally whooshed to
the sides by now.
Nothing happened. Obviously.
I tried the card again, pretending I expected the typical results.
Still, though, no one appeared.
“Hello?” I shouted over the barrier, hoping someone would hear
me and turn up. Moments later a security guard appeared from the
side of the turnstile I wanted to be on. As he approached, I remem-
ber wishing that I’d hit the building at a busier time because conges-
tion would’ve been imposed a greater sense of urgency on him to fix
the problem— it would’ve said for me, “Let me in so that all of these
other fine folks not aiming to rob you can get to work.” But that isn’t
how jobs work. You have to take what you are given and be agile
enough to respond to the circumstances as they unfold.
“Having issues?” he asked calmly.
“I am. This turnstile won’t let me through, and I’m late,” I said
gently, almost like I was defeated, rather than in a rush. My play on
humans’ distrust of technology was in full swing.
“I am sure we can fix that,” he said, maintaining eye contact.
“Try this one!” he said, gesturing to the turnstile one over.
Aw­ crap, I thought to myself, Why­ didn’t­ I­ think­ of­ that!
I had obviously pictured him just letting me through the side gate; I
had not envisioned him making me try all the turnstiles so we could
both be certain my keycard was a dud. Well, I thought as I walked to
the next turnstile, just­stick­to­law­3:­adhere­to­the­pretext.
70 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Bringing It All together
You’ll remember we started this chapter with eight questions:
• How to leave with the information or asset intact?
• How to secure the information or asset (to ensure you maintain
custody of it)?
• Security surrounding information or asset?
• Location(s) of information or asset?
• Weak point in security and means needed to circumvent it?
• Larger area around information or asset and means to traverse
area around it (the building it’s housed in or the network secu-
rity active to safeguard it)?
• Pretext for approach and entry?
• Economy of force?
Up until the point I just described, standing in a Manhattan
bank’s lobby, I knew all of the answers to these questions. Certainly,
I’d known some in more detail than others. For example, I knew the
answer to the first question (leaving with the information or asset
intact). The answer was to walk out with my phone on me because it
would be housing photos of this attack, as the client had requested,
and I knew I could further secure the asset by sending those photos
to my company’s secure portal periodically as I moved around the
building. This also took care of the next question you should ask
and answer when committing to a job: securing the information or
asset (to ensure you maintain custody of it).
As for “Location(s) of information or asset?” I was aware that
the CFO’s office was on the same floor as three of the bank’s largest
meeting rooms. This knowledge helped lead me to impersonate a
lawyer, given I also had found information pertaining to an immi-
nent merger that had hit some speed bumps.
The security surrounding the CFO’s office was minimal after
the ground security.
I knew the weak point in the security was the information I was
able to find out online— no one should be able to duplicate a guest
badge that they’ve found online to get past a business’s defenses.
The Laws 71
Pretext for approach and entry was informed by all the previ-
ous answers on the list combined with OSINT that had led to the
discovery that the business was in the middle of a large merger and
acquisition (M&A). I knew that, as long as I wasn’t discovered right
away, one pretext would be sufficient to get the job done. It was
designed to get me from the front door to the target’s office and
complete that portion of the mission.
Economy of force was the easiest question to answer in this case
because it was decided by scope. I was slated to go in during the day,
but we were also engaged to do night break-i ns too. We were instructed
to try all entrances and exits on our night trip and achieving that,
especially in a skyscraper in New York City, would take a team.
The Start of the End
In case you weren’t convinced, there is evidence that points toward
the end as a starting point being the right place. In philosophy it is
often accepted that all things are created twice—f irst in the mind,
and then in the real world. Physical creations follow mental ones,
from the computer I’m typing on to the book you are reading. This
book started off in my head, and now it exists outside of it. The same
thing is true of my computer and the desk it sits on, along with
almost everything else in the room. Attacks should be no different;
beginning with the end in mind is to visualize your specific project
the way that you want it to end up before you begin pursuing it. This
results in greater precision than pinballing your way there. Again,
this is not a form of “manifestation”—i t’s a form of agile planning.
The main reasons this “begin with the end in mind” philosophy is so
important come down to clarity, efficiency, and your objective, each
of which we will briefly look at in the following subsections.
Clarity
Remarkable clarity comes from knowing exactly where you want to end
up. As you’ve witnessed multiple times throughout this book already,
there’s nothing more clarifying than an objective. When you have it,
you are able to plan accordingly with only that in your crosshairs.
72 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
There’s another, often underrated benefit of this strategy: when
you begin with the end in mind, you’ll also gain clarity as to what not
to pursue. If your goal is to get onto a network without detection and
maintain persistence, you would avoid using any noisy tools. If you
were aiming to get into a facility that did not allow cameras or phones
but where your objective was to photograph the inside and walk
through the front door (it has happened), you would not walk in with
your devices on you. In this case, I attempted to hide devices around
the perimeter and upon getting in, I waited until I could tailgate out
a back door, collect the device, and come back in. I did eventually get
arrested on this job, because I was viewed on camera with my phone
in my hand taking photos. Was it my best moment? No. Am I still
proud of trying? Also no. I had to go to a chiropractor for about three
months after that arrest. They do not pin you to the ground softly. The
better idea here would’ve been a piece of jewelry with a small camera
inside. In hindsight, that’s definitely a better idea.
Starting with the end in mind provides a straight shot to clarity
holistically and that’s valuable.
Efficiency
When you begin with the end in mind you gain clarity, which will
naturally help you become more efficient. You’ll be able to plan and
strategize for the best route to your goals. Let’s say your job is to
break into a bank and get to the vaults. That’s your goal. Great, you
can now plan the most efficient way to achieve it. Instead of chasing
erroneous objectives, you’ll focus on just the steps you need to take
to get to the vaults. I would, in a case like this, set myself up for suc-
cess weeks in advance— months if the scope and project timeline
allowed for it by vishing the facility first.
Efficiency comes from always pushing in the direction of the
objective. This will always generate efficient results.
The Objective
Finally, when you begin with the end in mind, you gain purpose.
Some clients come with a loose set of goals. Most typically, you will
The Laws 73
hear the words, “Just whatever you can get.” These are generally
preceded or immediately followed by a beautiful sentence that goes
something like, “But there’s no way you will get in anyway.” I tend
to listen to neither.
If I am told to get “whatever” I can, I will research the most
damaging thing I can get. This is not to humiliate the client; it is to
illustrate how dangerous their mindset is. They should be able to
identify what is most precious to them.
If they tell me I won’t get in, I always feel a sense of relief for my
attacker life— their security is likely lacking because of exactly this
mentality and “security ego,” as I like to call it. Security ego is the
best thing to happen to an attacker, ethical or not. It’s also the worst
thing to happen to both a business and me afterward as those report
and awareness programs tend to be very long.
The key here, though, is focusing on what you really want to
achieve in any given engagement and working toward that only.
You don’t have to get caught up in every security flaw and attack
it, but you should note it for your client. As has been previously
discussed, your job is not to give a play-b y- play of your attack. It’s
to tell your client what happened, while also painting a picture of
their whole security landscape as you saw it.
How to Begin with the End in Mind
So far, we’ve covered the “what” and “why” in regard to beginning
with the end in mind. Now, let’s tackle the “how.” There are five steps.
When you begin with the end in mind, you set yourself up for
success. There’s no better way to identify what you actually need,
why it’s important to get it, and how to get it. To implement this
philosophy into your AMs, you can follow these five steps and build
on each for your own projects:
1. Narrow objective: What is it you need to achieve for this
engagement and client? The attack objective should be the one
you place here, not the overarching one, which is to strengthen
security as a security partner.
74 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
2. How long to get there: How should you budget your time?
Most engagements have solid start and end dates. This is both
good and bad for the client. It’s good because they will know
that, most likely, any attacks they see during the window of
time they have authorized are being executed by you; it is bad
because a true, malicious attacker will not perform all of their
operations under a neat timeframe. Some take months or years
to execute an end- to- end attack. However, the long and short
of it is that a business is unlikely to pay you to be its everlast-
ing threat, so you will be given a timeframe and you should
budget your time accordingly. You may not need three weeks
of OSINT. You might perform perfunctory OSINT only to get
yourself familiar with the environment and to gain you a pre-
text that does what all good pretexts should: conceals you as a
threat and makes you seem as though you should be there at
that time.
3. Design: Designing an attack is a complicated task in some
ways. I aim to keep mine to their simplest form, but that can
still become intricate. Planning to attack a bank or prison isn’t
an easy task, but it should be trimmed consistently to be the
simplest it can be— take the simplest route, adding complexity
only where necessary.
4. Fully commit: Fully committing takes two things: one is
comfort with risk— you cannot plan for every eventuality or
every reaction or every unknown thing; you can plan, craft, and
design so that the odds are in your favor, though. The second is
that you must commit to your pretext and the utilization of it.
If you do not feel your pretext properly asserts you as a per-
son that, in all the ways you can conceive, should be there or
that conceals you as a threat, then you might consider adjust-
ing or forming a new pretext. Alternatively, you might need to
switch pretexts as the attack unfolds, but doing so should be
inconspicuous.
5. Implement: This is go time. You should have been able to form
an objective and budget your time effectively for each step in
achieving it. Now it’s time to execute.
The Laws 75
Law 2: Gather, Weaponize, and Leverage Information
The true art of the attack doesn’t come from being able to act like an
attacker— it comes from being able to think like one. For instance,
when a company puts out seemingly innocuous information, it’s the
attacker’s mindset—t heir thoughts, outlook, and approach— that
molds it into exploitable intelligence to be used against them. The
ordinary reader or listener will simply process the information as
intended by the source, and an ordinary person will take the infor-
mation and search for more of the same if curious; a good attacker
will use it as a starting point, exploring a surplus of information
through the lens of their objective, disregarding all that cannot be
used in a future attack and building on all that can. An attacker
only gathers information to build, forward, and execute an attack.
Information is the star of the show.
Picking this apart, there is one other thing that is crucial to
successfully adopting and maintaining this mindset: the tieback.
Similar to the callback in comedy, the tieback is the act of binding
information to the needs of the objective. If the information you are
sifting through is not beneficial for pretexting or using information
against a target; it should be disregarded. There’s not a set list of
things that do and don’t matter—t he objective dictates these kinds
of things. Intuitively parsing information as it comes to you is a deft
skill that cannot be overlooked in the name of both efficiency and
AMs sharpness.
Let’s look at a simple example to start. If I am gathering infor-
mation on a single target, with the objective to compile a seemingly
legitimate phish, nearly any information becomes valuable and
potentially weaponizable. Knowing the make and model of their
car is valuable if I want to make them think they have a ticket and
send them a link to view all the related information, but I’d have
to consider whether a personal message like that would go to their
work email account. The name of their child’s school is valuable if
I want to register for a one- on- one session to discuss the progress
