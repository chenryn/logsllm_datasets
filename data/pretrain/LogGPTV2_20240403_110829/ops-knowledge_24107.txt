Sure, here is a more structured and professional version of the log data:

```
{
  "timestamp": "10.30 16:49:06",
  "program": "chrome.exe",
  "proxy_server": "proxy.cse.cuhk.edu.hk:5070",
  "action": "open through proxy",
  "protocol": "HTTPS"
}
```

This format makes it easier to read and process the log information.
