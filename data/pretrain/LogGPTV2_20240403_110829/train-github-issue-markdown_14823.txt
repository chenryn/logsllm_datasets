I’m working on a Rails project that uses the react-rails gem. We have React
15.1.0 and a pre-made modal component that requires react-addons-transition-
group 15.0.1 (among other things). When the modal loads, I get the following
error:
Uncaught Invariant Violation: addComponentAsRefTo(...): Only a ReactOwner can
have refs. You might be adding a ref to a component that was not created
inside a component's `render` method, or you have multiple copies of React
loaded (details: https://fb.me/react-refs-must-have-owner)
When I try to close the modal I get this error:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'componentWillEnter' of undefined
I’m not having any trouble using React in other components. I’ve already
deleted and reinstalled my node_modules folder. Is this a known issue? Any
tips?
I've already reviewed the following resources and attempted to debug per their
suggestions, to no avail:
