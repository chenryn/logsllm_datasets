We are exploring the use of React for developing custom native user interfaces that go beyond the capabilities of react-native and react-windows-native. `ReactFiberReconciler` appears to be a sensible starting point, especially considering the increasing adoption of fibers in mainstream React. So far, it has proven relatively straightforward to set up a proof of concept using this approach.

If `ReactFiberReconciler` is not the recommended entry point, what alternative would you suggest for third-party renderers?
