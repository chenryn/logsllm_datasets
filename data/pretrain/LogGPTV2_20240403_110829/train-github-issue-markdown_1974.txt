We are investigating using React for drawing custom native UIs (that fall
outside the scope of react-native and react-windows-native).
`ReactFiberReconciler` seems like the most sensible place to start (assuming
fibers start getting used in mainline relatively soon, which seems reasonably
likely), and it certainly seems to be very easy to get a proof of concept up
and running using it, at least so far.
If not this, then what is the recommended entry point for 3rd party renders to
use?
