Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Have code open with git enabled on a repository (in particular, I'm working with @mozilla/gecko-dev)
  2. Do a `git rebase -i` that will take a while (my case had 11 commits that I was squashing into 1)
A few times during the rebase, my rebase stopped because it couldn't create
index.lock, saying it already existed. If I then did `git rebase --continue`
things would carry on. (FTR, git also totally messed up the squashing in this
case, but that's a git bug, not a code bug.) I realized that code's git
integration was interfering with my rebase, quit code, `git reset --hard` to
the original commit, and redid my rebase, and everything worked fine. My best
guess is that the periodic `git status` (or similar) that code does was racing
with the various commits of `git rebase`, and when code won, it would mess up
the rebase. Code should probably avoid updating its internal knowledge of the
working directory status while a rebase (or similar) is running. (Not sure if
that's entirely possible, but it's at least something to think about.)
