## Abstract
We evaluate the use of data obtained by illicit means against a broad set of ethical and legal issues. Our analysis covers both the direct collection and secondary uses of data obtained via illicit means, such as exploiting a vulnerability or unauthorized disclosure. We extract ethical principles from existing advice and guidance and analyze how they have been applied in more than 42 recent peer-reviewed papers that deal with illicitly obtained datasets. We find that existing advice and guidance does not address all the problems researchers face. The papers tackle ethical issues inconsistently, and sometimes not at all. Our analysis reveals not only a lack of application of safeguards but also that legitimate ethical justifications for research are being overlooked. In many cases, positive benefits, as well as potential harms, remain entirely unidentifiable. Few papers record explicit Research Ethics Board (REB) approval for the activity described, and the justifications given for exemption suggest deficiencies in the REB process.

## Introduction
The scientific method requires empirical evidence to test hypotheses. Consequently, both the gathering and use of data are essential components of science and support evidence-based decision-making. Computer scientists make significant use of data to support research and inform policy, including data obtained through illegal or unethical behavior.

In this paper, we consider the ethical and legal issues surrounding the use of datasets of illicit origin, which we define as data collected as a result of:
1. Exploiting a vulnerability in a computer system.
2. An unintended disclosure by the data owner.
3. An unauthorized leak by someone with access to the data.

Using a dataset of illicit origin to support research can be advantageous. For example, legitimate access to data may not be possible, or reusing data of illicit origin may require fewer resources than collecting data from scratch. Additionally, sharing and reusing existing datasets aid reproducibility, an important scientific goal. However, ethical and legal questions may arise from the use of such data.

Some researchers who use datasets of illicit origin consider ethical and legal issues, particularly through the introduction of ethical consideration sections in papers [5] and the development and use of institutional resources such as Research Ethics Boards (REBs) [48]. Unfortunately, our work shows that neither is common practice, and even where they are tackled, ethical and legal considerations often appear incomplete. Therefore, potential harms may have occurred that might otherwise have been mitigated or avoided. Research lacking sufficient ethical consideration may still be ethical, but it is difficult to assess this.

General guidance, such as that provided by the Menlo Report [4:], offers useful advice but does not address all the issues that arise in using data of illicit origin. Academic discussions have taken place [54], and there are blog posts and other informal articles by academics on the topic [33;, 346], but there is little detailed analysis or systematic knowledge exploring this problem in depth.

The goal of this paper is to address this gap by providing a detailed evaluation of the use of data of illicit origin in peer-reviewed research and supporting the development of a more nuanced understanding of the issues and problems in this space. We do this by first reviewing previous work to identify the ethical (§4) and legal (§5) issues that can arise. We then analyze over 42 recent peer-reviewed papers that make use of data of illicit origin (§6) and systematize (Table 3) the ethical and legal decisions made against a common set of justifications, safeguards, potential harms, and potential benefits (§7).

## 4. Ethics
Ethical norms are constantly evolving, with research ethics developing over the course of the 20th century and becoming more prominent in our field in the 21st century. Previous work related to the ethical use of data of illicit origin spans several topics, including informed consent, human rights, releasing and using shared data, hacking, analysis techniques, ethical review, and Research Ethics Boards (REBs). We consider each of these in turn.

### Informed Consent
The earliest work on the ethics of computer-monitored data explored informed consent and emphasized the right of withdrawal and the importance of data anonymization [:;]. The first difficulty with data of illicit origin is that it is not always possible to meet these requirements. Acquiring consent from users involved in leaked data is challenging, particularly if they are involved in illegal activities [94]. In the case of data obtained from underground marketplaces, covert research without consent is necessary to understand what is traded due to the illegality of the goods bought or sold—consent could affect the results [323]. This is one of the exceptions for informed consent in the ethics statement of the British Society of Criminology, which states that "covert research may be allowed where the ends might be thought to justify the means" [45].

In cases where consent is possible, previous work has concluded that if informed consent has been given based on a promise of confidentiality by the researcher, then researchers should take particular care to ensure they are willing to keep the promises they make, especially if doing so might require them to break the law [74].

Where informed consent is impossible to obtain, the Menlo Report recommends that the REB must protect the interests of the individuals [48]. Thus, the REB has a particularly important role to play in research that makes use of data of illicit origin where informed consent is not possible [45].

### Human Rights
Human rights provide an important ethical baseline. These include the right to life, the right to be free of arbitrary arrest, the right to a fair trial, a presumption of innocence until proven guilty, a right to not have arbitrary invasions of privacy, and a right not to be arbitrarily deprived of property [334]. Research using data of illicit origin may indirectly deprive people of such rights and thus needs to be considered. For example, in the Philippines in 2018, suspected illegal drug users or dealers were subject to extrajudicial assassinations [8]. Hence, care would need to be taken with data collected from online drug markets to ensure it did not result in such abuse.

### Releasing and Using Shared Data
The WECSR workshop in 2014 convened a panel of experts from different domains who agreed that research involving data of illicit origin would need to have a clear benefit to society [54]. They also argued that simply because data is public does not exempt research using such data from obtaining REB approval since it might contain personally identifiable information. This echoes the Menlo Report's suggestion that the REB must protect the interests of individuals where informed consent is impossible.

Sharing of datasets is beneficial for data science, but the purpose and scope for using such data must be stated [3;]. Allman and Paxson discussed the ethical issues of releasing data, using data released by others, and the interactions between providers and users of data [6]. A key ethical consideration in this context is privacy protection. It is likely that data of illicit origin was not intended for research purposes or public exposure, and thus it may not be anonymized. In such cases, the raw dataset should not be shared publicly, and research conducted with such data should aim to preserve privacy. Researchers who hold data of illicit origin should only provide details of their source or (as Allman and Paxson suggest) share data with verified researchers under a written acceptable usage policy. None of the papers we discuss later took this approach. Partridge argues that papers in network measurement research should have an ethics section, partly to increase the availability of examples of ethical reasoning [:5]. We show in §7 that few papers using data of illicit origin have an ethics section.

Both Allman & Paxson, and Partridge warn against relying on the anonymization of data since deanonymization techniques are often surprisingly powerful. Robust anonymization of data is difficult, particularly when it has high dimensionality, as the anonymization is likely to lead to an unacceptable level of data loss [5].

### Hacking and Intervening
Hacking into computers to extract information is usually unethical [324] and illegal. Moore and Clayton considered ethical dilemmas in takedown research resulting from nine dilemmas they faced during their research. They considered the balance between reducing harm uncovered during measurements and the accuracy of such measurements, the dangers of telling criminals the flaws in their systems, and the importance of ensuring that proposed interventions are likely to work [97]. Dittrich et al. provide two case studies on ethical decision-making for remote mitigation of botnets [4;]. They discuss the ethical issues involved, including the reasons for and against intervening.

### Analysis Techniques
The ethics committee of the Association of Internet Researchers' (AoIR) has produced guidance for ethical decision-making in Internet research in 2004 [55] and 2014 [93]. This cross-disciplinary work provides useful questions to aid researchers in considering the ethics of their research and defines a process for ethical decision-making. AoIR aimed to publish case studies of the application of their guidelines but has not yet done so. This paper considers over 42 papers that might have used the AoIR ethics guidelines, but only one of them (§6.5.4) did so. Keegan and Matias developed a multi-party risk-benefit framework for use in analyzing ethical considerations for online community research [78]. While this was implicitly intended for research surrounding particular online community platforms, the same principles apply to research that considers the online community of the Internet, and so it may be a helpful technique.

### Ethical Review
The Menlo Report [4:] and its companion [48] are the primary references on ethical practice in Information Communication Technology Research (ICTR), particularly for USA-based researchers. It includes numerous questions to help researchers consider ethical issues and case studies to illustrate their application. It identifies that ICTR has a greater scale, speed, coupling, decentralization, distribution, and opacity than traditional human subject research and hence re-examines the particular ethical principles required to evaluate ICTR. It identifies four ethical principles [48, §B]:
- **Respect for persons:** Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and persons with diminished autonomy should be given additional protection.
- **Beneficence:** Minimize possible harms and maximize possible benefits. The researcher should also use safeguards against potential harms.
- **Justice:** Risks and benefits should be distributed fairly and not on the basis of protected characteristics such as race, or other characteristics that correlate with protected ones.
- **Respect for law and public interest:** Generally, ethical research conforms to applicable laws in relevant jurisdictions. Research should always be in the public interest. Additionally, research should be open, transparent, reproducible, and peer-reviewed.

### Research Ethics Boards (REBs)
Program committees or journal editors can review the ethics of work after it has been conducted but before it is published. REBs, known as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in many US institutions or Ethics Committees in some UK institutions, review the ethics of proposed research before it is conducted. Many REBs were originally formed in response to a review of the ethics of medical research following revelations of unethical medical research conducted prior to the 1970s [48, §A.3]. In this context, there were clearly human subjects whose rights needed to be protected. The term "human subject" is now deprecated in ethical review in favor of considering the wide variety of people who might be "participants" in the research, even if they are not aware the research is being conducted. However, some REBs are still structured around serving this original purpose and thus lack the expertise to understand ICTR or the process to evaluate research whose risks and challenges differ from a medical trial. Such structures discourage researchers from using REBs as they do not add value and may introduce many months of delay. By contrast, other REBs (such as ours in Cambridge) have ICTR specialists and aim to provide a response in five working days for simple cases. In general, REBs are required because researchers are biased when assessing the ethics of their own research [48]. REBs can help researchers identify additional safeguards or improvements in experimental design that make the work ethical and can help protect researchers from liability.

### 4.3 Ethical Issues
To support the analysis of case studies in §6, we list the set of ethical issues that require consideration when conducting research with data of illicit origin:
- **Identification of stakeholders:** Primary, secondary, and key stakeholders should be identified to support the analysis of the potential harms and benefits of the research. Primary stakeholders are those directly connected with the data, such as those identified in it; secondary stakeholders are intermediaries in the delivery of benefits or harms, such as service providers; and key stakeholders are those such as the leaker or the researcher who are critical to the conduct of the research.
- **Informed consent:** In most of the research we consider, it was impossible or impractical to obtain informed consent from the primary, and in some cases secondary, stakeholders. However, research may be designed such that informed consent is not required. Since none of the case studies we have considered obtained informed consent for their use of data of illicit origin, we do not consider it in later analysis.
- **Identify harms:** The potential harms arising from the use of the data of illicit origin should be identified.
- **Safeguards:** Researchers should apply mechanisms to mitigate or reduce the potential for harm.
- **Justice:** The research does not unfairly advantage or disadvantage any particular social or cultural group.
- **Public interest:** The research has been published, is reproducible, and there is a "social acceptability" exceeding the harms [57].

## 5. Legal Issues
Legal issues surrounding research with data collected illegally can be complex, particularly as the laws of multiple jurisdictions are likely to be applicable. We are not lawyers, and researchers should seek their own legal advice. Countries whose laws may apply to research being conducted include those where individuals or systems that these data refer to reside, the countries where data was stored, the countries where the researchers conducted the research, and possibly any countries that data transited during any part of this process. Researchers often travel and so they should consider the impact of committing offenses, both in their home jurisdiction and in countries that they visit or that they might be extradited to.

The key legal issues applicable to research with data of illicit origin are as follows:

### Computer Misuse
Most jurisdictions now have laws against the misuse or abuse of computers, such as the UK [43], the US [3], and Germany [5:, 5;, 62, 63]. These can cover generic actions such as the unauthorized use of a computer system (even if there was no technical measure in place to prevent it) and the use of malware or 'dual-use' tools that may be used for malicious purposes.

### Copyright
The right to produce copies, including, in some jurisdictions, database rights and trade secrets, may apply to data obtained by researchers. In particular, it may affect the further sharing of data with other researchers as that might constitute the creation of copies. There are exemptions to copyright such as "fair use," which vary with jurisdiction.

### Data Privacy
Data may contain personally identifiable information, which may mean it needs to be protected and processed in accordance with relevant Data Privacy and Data Protection rules. In several jurisdictions, IP addresses may be considered personal data, which complicates their use, particularly where consent has not been obtained. This is the case in Germany [337, p4;], though a European Court of Justice ruling has found that personally identifiable data can still be processed without consent for security purposes (e.g., IP addresses in web server logs) [6:]. There is an exemption for the use of personal data in Germany "if it is necessary for a research entity in order to conduct a scientific research, the scientific interest to conduct the research project substantially predominates over the interest of the data subject in exclusion of the change of purpose the data was collected for, and if the research cannot be conducted otherwise or can otherwise only be conducted with disproportionate effort" [6:].

This comprehensive analysis aims to provide a robust framework for researchers to navigate the ethical and legal complexities of using datasets of illicit origin.
