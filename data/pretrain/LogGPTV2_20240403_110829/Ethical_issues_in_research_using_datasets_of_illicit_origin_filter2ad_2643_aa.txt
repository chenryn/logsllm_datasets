ABSTRACT
We evaluate the use of data obtained by illicit means against
a broad set of ethical and legal issues. Our analysis covers
both the direct collection, and secondary uses of, data ob-
tained via illicit means such as exploiting a vulnerability, or
unauthorized disclosure. We extract ethical principles from
existing advice and guidance and analyse how they have been
applied within more than 42 recent peer reviewed papers that
deal with illicitly obtained datasets. We ﬁnd that existing
advice and guidance does not address all of the problems that
researchers have faced and explain how the papers tackle
ethical issues inconsistently, and sometimes not at all. Our
analysis reveals not only a lack of application of safeguards
but also that legitimate ethical justiﬁcations for research are
being overlooked. In many cases positive beneﬁts, as well as
potential harms, remain entirely unidentiﬁed. Few papers
record explicit Research Ethics Board (REB) approval for
the activity that is described and the justiﬁcations given for
exemption suggest deﬁciencies in the REB process.

INTRODUCTION
3
The scientiﬁc method requires empirical evidence to test
hypotheses. Consequently, both the gathering, and the use
of, data is an essential component of science and supports
evidence-based decision making. Computer scientists make
signiﬁcant use of data to support research and inform policy,
and this includes data which was obtained through illegal or
unethical behaviour.
In this paper we consider the ethical and legal issues sur-
rounding the use of datasets of illicit origin, which we deﬁne
as data collected as a result of (i) the exploitation of a vulner-
ability in a computer system; (ii) an unintended disclosure
by the data owner; or (iii) an unauthorized leak by someone
with access to the data.
The collection, or use, of a dataset of illicit origin to support
research can be advantageous. For example, legitimate access
to data may not be possible, or the reuse of data of illicit
origin is likely to require fewer resources than collecting data
again from scratch. In addition, the sharing and reuse of
existing datasets aids reproducibility, an important scientiﬁc
goal. The disadvantage is that ethical and legal questions
may arise as a result of the use of such data.
There is evidence that some researchers who use datasets
of illicit origin consider ethical and legal issues, particularly
through the introduction of ethical consideration sections
into papers [:5] and the development and use of institutional
resources such as Research Ethics Boards (REBs) [48]. Un-
fortunately, our work shows that neither is common practice,
and even where they are tackled, ethical and legal consid-
erations often appear incomplete. It therefore follows that
potential harms may have taken place which might otherwise
have been mitigated or avoided. Research that lacks suﬃcient
ethical consideration may still be ethical, but it is diﬃcult to
assess this.
General guidance, such as that provided by the Menlo
Report [4:], provides useful advice, but does not address all
the issues that arise in using data of illicit origin. Academic
discussions have taken place [54], and there are blog posts and
other informal articles by academics on the topic [33;, 346],
but to date there is little in the way of detailed analysis, or
a systematisation of knowledge, which explores this problem
in depth.

The goal of this paper is to address this gap and provide a
detailed evaluation of the use of data of illicit origin in peer-
reviewed research, and to support the development of a more
nuanced understanding of the issues and problems in this
space. We do this by ﬁrst reviewing previous work to identify
the ethical (§4) and legal (§5) issues that can arise. We then
analyse over 42 recent peer-reviewed papers which make
use of data of illicit origin (§6), and systematize (Table 3)
the ethical and legal decisions made against a common set
of justiﬁcations, safeguards, potential harms and potential
beneﬁts (§7).
4 ETHICS
Ethical norms are constantly changing with research ethics
developing over the course of the 42th century and becoming
more prominent in our ﬁeld in the 43st century. Previous
work related to the ethical use of data of illicit origin spans a
number of topics, including informed consent, human rights,
releasing and using shared data, hacking, analysis techniques,
ethical review, and Research Ethics Boards (REBs). We
consider each of these in turn.
Informed consent: The earliest work on the ethics of
computer-monitored data explored informed consent and
emphasised the right of withdrawal as well as the importance
of data anonymisation [:;]. The ﬁrst diﬃculty with data of
illicit origin is that it is not always possible to meet these re-
quirements. Acquiring consent from users involved in leaked
data is challenging, particularly if they are involved in illegal
activities [94]. In the case of data obtained from underground
marketplaces, covert research without consent is necessary to
understand what is traded due to the illegality of the goods
bought or sold – consent could aﬀect the results [323]. This
is one of the exceptions for informed consent in the ethics
statement of the British Society of Criminology, which states
that “covert research may be allowed where the ends might
be thought to justify the means” [45].
In cases where consent is possible, previous work has con-
cluded that if informed consent has been given on the basis
of a promise of conﬁdentiality by the researcher, then re-
searchers should take particular care to ensure that they are
willing to keep the promises they make, particularly if doing
so might require them to break the law [74].
Where informed consent is impossible to obtain, the Menlo
Report recommends that the REB must protect the interests
of the individuals [48]. Thus, the REB has a particularly
important role to play in research which makes use of data
of illicit origin where informed consent is not possible [45].
Human rights: Human rights also provide an important
ethical baseline. These include, the right to life, the right
to be free of arbitrary arrest, the right to a fair trial, a
presumption of innocence until proven guilty, a right to not
have arbitrary invasions of privacy, and a right not to be
arbitrarily deprived of property [334]. Research using data of
illicit origin may indirectly deprive people of such rights and
so this needs to be considered. For example, in Philippines
in 4238, suspected illegal drug users or dealers were subject
to extra-judicial assassination [8] and hence care would need
to be taken with data collected from online drug markets to
ensure this did not result in such abuse.
Releasing and using shared data: The WECSR workshop
in 4234 convened a panel of experts from diﬀerent domains
who agreed that research involving data of illicit origin would
need to have a clear beneﬁt to society [54]. They also argued
that simply because data is public does not exempt research
using such data from obtaining REB approval since it might
contain personally identiﬁable information. This echoes the
Menlo Report’s suggestion that the REB must protect the
interests of individuals where informed consent is impossible.
Sharing of datasets is beneﬁcial for data science, but the
purpose and scope for using such data must be stated [3;].
Allman and Paxson discussed the ethical issues of releasing
data, using data released by others, and the interactions
between providers and users of data [6]. A key ethical consid-
eration in this context is privacy protection. It is likely that
data of illicit origin was not intended for research purposes or
public exposure, and thus it may not be anonymised. In such
cases, the raw dataset should not be shared publicly, and
research conducted with such data should aim to preserve
privacy. Researchers who hold data of illicit origin should
only provide details of their source or (as Allman and Paxson
suggest) share data with veriﬁed researchers under a written
acceptable usage policy. None of the papers we discuss later
took this approach. Partridge argues that papers in network
measurement research should have an ethics section, partly to
increase the availability of examples of ethical reasoning [:5].
We show in §7 that few papers using data of illicit origin
have an ethics section.
Both Allman & Paxson, and Partridge warn against relying
on the anonymisation of data since deanonymisation tech-
niques are often surprisingly powerful. Robust anonymisation
of data is diﬃcult, particularly when it has high dimensional-
ity, as the anonymisation is likely to lead to an unacceptable
level of data loss [5].
Hacking and intervening: Hacking into computers to ex-
tract information is usually unethical [324] and illegal. Moore
and Clayton considered ethical dilemmas in take-down re-
search resulting from nine dilemmas they faced during their
research. They considered the balance between reducing
harm uncovered during measurements and the accuracy of
such measurements, the dangers of telling criminals the ﬂaws
in their systems and the importance of ensuring that pro-
posed interventions are likely to work [97]. Dittrich et al.
provide two case studies on ethical decision making for remote
mitigation of botnets [4;]. They discuss the ethical issues
involved including the reasons for and against intervening.
Analysis techniques: The ethics committee of the Associa-
tion of Internet Researchers’ (AoIR) has produced guidance
for ethical decision making in Internet research in 4224 [55]
and 4234 [93]. This cross-disciplinary work provides useful
questions to aid researchers in considering the ethics of their
research and deﬁnes a process for ethical decision making.
AoIR aimed to publish case studies of the application of their

guidelines but this has not yet happened. This paper consid-
ers over 42 papers which might have used the AoIR ethics
guidelines but only one of them (§6.5.4) did so. Keegan
and Matias developed a multi-party risk beneﬁt framework
for use in analysing ethical considerations for online com-
munity research [78]. While this was implicitly intended for
research surrounding particular online community platforms,
the same principles apply to research that considers the on-
line community of the Internet, and so it may be a helpful
technique.
Ethical review: The Menlo Report [4:] and its compan-
ion [48] are the primary reference on ethical practice in
Information Communication Technology Research (ICTR),
particularly for USA-based researchers. It includes numerous
questions to help researchers consider ethical issues and case
studies to illustrate their application. It identiﬁes that ICTR
has a greater scale, speed, coupling, decentralisation, distribu-
tion, and opacity than traditional human subject research and
hence it re-examines the particular ethical principles required
to evaluate ICTR. It identiﬁes four ethical principles [48,
§B]: Respect for persons: individuals should be treated
as autonomous agents and persons with diminished autonomy
should be given additional protection. Beneﬁcence: min-
imise possible harms, and maximise possible beneﬁts. The
researcher should also use safeguards against potential harms.
Justice: risks and beneﬁts should be distributed fairly and
not on the basis of protected characteristics such as race,
or other characteristics that correlated with protected ones.
Respect for law and public interest: in general ethical
research conforms to applicable laws in relevant jurisdictions.
Research should always be in the public interest. Addition-
ally, research should be open, transparent, reproducible and
peer-reviewed.
Research Ethics Boards (REBs): Program committees or
journal editors are able to review the ethics of work after
it has been conducted but before it is published. REBs,
known as Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) in many US
institutions or Ethics Committees in some UK institutions,
review the ethics of proposed research before it is conducted.
Many REBs were originally formed in response to a review
of the ethics of medical research following revelations of un-
ethical medical research conducted prior to the 3;92s [48,
§A.3]. In this context there were clearly human subjects who
had rights that needed to be protected. The term “human
subject” is now deprecated in ethical review in favour of
considering the wide variety of people who might be “par-
ticipants” in the research, even if they are not aware the
research is being conducted. However, some REBs are still
structured around serving this original purpose, and thus
they lack the expertise to understand ICTR or the process
to evaluate research whose risks and challenges diﬀer from
a medical trial. Such structures discourage researchers from
using REBs as they do not add value and may introduce
many months of delay. By contrast other REBs (such as ours
in Cambridge) have ICTR specialists and aim to provide a
response in ﬁve working days for simple cases. In general
REBs are required because researchers are biased when as-
sessing the ethics of their own research [48]. REBs can help
researchers identify additional safeguards or improvements
in experimental design that make the work ethical, and can
help protect researchers from liability.
4.3 Ethical issues
In order to support analysis of case studies in §6, we now
list the set of ethical issues that require consideration when
conducting research with data of illicit origin:
Identiﬁcation of stakeholders: The primary, secondary,
and key stakeholders should be identiﬁed to support the
analysis of the potential harms and beneﬁts of the research.
Primary stakeholders are those directly connected with data,
such as those identiﬁed in it; secondary stakeholders are
intermediaries in the delivery of beneﬁts or harms, such as
service providers; and key stakeholders are those such as the
leaker or the researcher who are critical to the conduct of
the research.
Informed consent: In most of the research we consider it
was impossible or impractical to obtain informed consent
from the primary, and in some cases secondary, stakeholders.
However, research may be designed such that informed con-
sent is not required. Since none of the case studies we have
considered obtained informed consent for their use of data of
illicit origin, we do not consider it in later analysis.
Identify harms: The potential harms arising from the use
of the data of illicit origin should be identiﬁed.
Safeguards: Researchers should apply mechanisms to miti-
gate or reduce the potential for harm.
Justice: The research does not unfairly advantage or dis-
advantage any particular social or cultural group.
Public interest: The research has been published, is repro-
ducible, and there is a “social acceptability” exceeding the
harms [57].
5 LEGAL ISSUES
Legal issues surrounding research with data collected ille-
gally can be complex, particularly as the laws of multiple
jurisdictions are likely to be applicable. We are not lawyers
and researchers should seek their own legal advice. Countries
whose laws that may apply to research being conducted in-
clude those where individuals or systems that these data refer
to reside, the countries where data was stored, the countries
where the researchers conducted the research, and possibly
also any countries that data transited during any part of
this process. Researchers often travel and so they should
consider the impact of committing oﬀences, both in their
home jurisdiction and in countries that they visit or that
they might be extradited to.
The key legal issues applicable to research with data of
illicit origin are as follows:
Computer Misuse: Most jurisdictions now have laws against
the misuse or abuse of computers such as the UK [43], the
US [3], and Germany [5:, 5;, 62, 63]. These can cover generic
actions such as the unauthorised use of a computer system
IMC ’39, November 3–5, 4239, London, UK
Daniel R. Thomas et al.
(even if there was no technical measure in place to prevent
it), and the use of malware, or ‘dual use’ tools that may be
used for malicious purposes.
Copyright: The right to produce copies, including, in some
jurisdictions, database rights, and trade secrets may apply to
data obtained by researchers. In particular, it may aﬀect the
further sharing of data with other researchers as that might
constitute the creation of copies. There are exemptions to
copyright such as “fair use”, which vary with jurisdiction.
Data Privacy: Data may contain personally identiﬁable
information which may mean it needs to be protected and
processed in accordance with relevant Data Privacy and Data
Protection rules. In several jurisdictions IP addresses may
be considered personal data, which complicates their use,
particularly where consent has not been obtained. This is
the case in Germany [337, p4;], though a European Court of
Justice ruling has found that personally identiﬁable data can
still be processed without consent for security purposes (e.g.
IP addresses in web server logs) [6:]. There is an exemption
for the use of the personal data in Germany “if it is necessary
for a research entity in order to conduct a scientiﬁc research,
the scientiﬁc interest to conduct the research project substan-
tially predominates over the interest of the data subject in
exclusion of the change of purpose the data was collected for,
and if the research cannot be conducted otherwise or can oth-
