### DANE Deployment and Standardization

While the extension for DANE (DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities) has not yet been standardized, it is gaining traction. Dukhovni et al. periodically publish DANE deployment statistics [34, 77], and they recently found that 1.4 million domains publish signed MX records with TLSA records. Tools such as DANE SMTP Validator [32] and DANECheck [25] assist administrators in verifying the correct deployment of DANE.

### Our Study's Contributions

Our study extends previous research in three key ways:

1. **Longitudinal Analysis**: We examine all TLSA records in three of the largest generic top-level domains (gTLDs: .com, .net, .org) and two country code top-level domains (ccTLDs: .nl, .se) with the highest DNSSEC deployment rates over a 24-month period. This allows us to investigate the status of DANE deployment over time.
   
2. **Impact of Incentives**: We focus on how recent incentives for DANE deployment [13, 19, 59] have influenced the dynamics of the DANE ecosystem. This contrasts with earlier work in 2014 [83], which focused on the initial stages of DANE deployment when no one relied on MX records and their corresponding TLSA records.

3. **Detailed Longitudinal Study**: We conduct a detailed longitudinal study to observe how email servers have changed their MX and TLSA records over time.

### Datasets

#### 4.1 Datasets

Our goal is to conduct a large-scale, longitudinal measurement study of DANE deployment in the email ecosystem, focusing on authoritative DNS servers.

**Daily Scans: MX and TLSA Records**

We use data from the OpenINTEL [60, 80] measurement platform, which fetches DNS records for all registered domains in many TLDs, currently covering around 65% of the global name space. For our study, we selected data for the gTLDs (.com, .net, and .org) and the ccTLDs (.nl and .se), finding 178 million resolvable domains in the dataset. These TLDs were chosen because .com, .net, and .org are the three largest TLDs, and .nl and .se have high rates of DNSSEC deployment [33], which is essential for DANE.

For each domain, we first extract SOA and DNSKEY records with corresponding RRSIG records, and MX records. We then construct a domain name to query TLSA records based on each MX record. The daily snapshots were fetched for 24 months between October 22, 2017, and October 31, 2019. Table 1 summarizes this dataset.

| TLD   | Number of Domains | Percentage with TLSA |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|
| .com  | 72,981,465        | 0.7%                 |
| .net  | 7,440,488         | 7.3%                 |
| .org  | 6,112,057         | 7.0%                 |
| .nl   | 4,369,343         | 9.8%                 |
| .se   | 860,413           | 38.2%                |

Table 1: Overview of the daily datasets for this study. The number and percentage of domains with TLSA records are as of October 31, 2019.

### DANE Prevalence

#### 4.2 DANE Prevalence

We begin by examining the deployment of DANE by email servers, focusing on the number of second-level domains that serve at least one TLSA record for their MX records. Figure 2 shows the fractions of .com, .net, .org, .nl, and .se second-level domains that publish at least one TLSA record for their MX records.

- **DANE Deployment in gTLDs**: DANE deployment for MX records is very rare in gTLDs, with only 0.6% (.com) to 0.73% (.org) of domains having TLSA records for their MX records.
- **Growth Trend**: The fraction of MX records with TLSA records is steadily growing. For example, in .com, the fraction rose from 0.10% in October 2017 to 0.65% in October 2019, indicating more than 400,000 MX records now have accompanying TLSA records.
- **Higher Deployment in ccTLDs**: The deployment rate is much higher in .nl and .se, likely due to financial incentives from the registries, as reported in recent studies [23, 49].
- **Influence of Email Service Providers**: The growth in DANE deployment is mainly due to a small number of email service providers, such as one.com and Loopia, providing email hosting services leveraging TLSA records. For instance, one.com published a single TLSA record, impacting 934,066 domains, and Loopia deployed TLSA records for its 76,776 domains.

### Security Considerations

#### 4.3 Security Considerations

We focus on second-level domains that serve at least one TLSA record for their MX records. However, to prevent active attackers from disrupting SMTP connections, it is ideal to deploy TLSA records for all MX records.

**Full DANE Deployment**

Figure 4 shows the ratio of domains that fully deployed TLSA records. We make several observations:

- **Partial Deployment**: A substantial portion of domains partially deployed TLSA records. On average, 18% of .com, .net, and .org, and 39% of .nl domains did not fully deploy TLSA records in our oldest snapshot, making them susceptible to downgrade attacks. This fraction is decreasing, with less than 5% of .com, .net, and .org, and 15% of .nl domains partially deploying TLSA records in the latest snapshot.
- **Large Email Providers**: Large email providers like one.com and Loopia.se initially partially deployed TLSA records and then introduced DANE for all MX records a few days later. This approach minimizes the risk of potential mistakes during deployment and configuration.

### DANE Management

#### 5 DANE Management

Properly managing DANE for emails involves:

1. Enabling DNSSEC correctly by publishing DNSKEY and RRSIG records and uploading a DS record in the TLD zone.
2. Publishing a TLSA record.
3. Supporting STARTTLS and serving a certificate that can be verified using the TLSA record.

#### 5.1 Dataset

To understand how domains with MX and TLSA records deploy and operate DANE correctly, we use the Daily dataset for coarse-grained analysis and an additional Hourly dataset for finer-grained analysis.

**Hourly Scans: Certificates and TLSA Records**

- **Methodology**: We obtain all MX and TLSA records from the Daily dataset, updated daily. We developed a measurement SMTP client that initiates SMTP connections to email servers, sends the STARTTLS command, and fetches certificates every hour. We also collect and validate TLSA records in terms of DNSSEC.
- **Vantage Points**: We deployed the measurement SMTP client in five different vantage points around the world (Oregon, Virginia, São Paulo, Paris, Sydney) to comprehensively understand the behavior of email and DNS servers. All measurement clients are synchronized to minimize discrepancies.

Table 2 summarizes the Hourly dataset.

| Vantage Point | Number of Certs | Number of TLSA Records |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Oregon        | 10,526          | 11,821                 |
| Virginia      | 10,521          | 11,806                 |
| São Paulo     | 10,470          | 11,771                 |
| Paris         | 10,531          | 11,819                 |
| Sydney        | 11,770          | 10,484                 |

Table 2: Overview of the Hourly datasets. The number of collected TLSA records and certificates are as of the last snapshot on October 31, 2019.

### Missing Components

#### 5.2 Missing Components

We examine whether domains that publish TLSA records also:

1. Publish all necessary DNSSEC records.
2. Support STARTTLS.

**DNSSEC**

- **Signed TLSA Records**: 80% of TLSA records are signed, but 18.5% of these do not have corresponding DS records, making them unverifiable. This aligns with a recent study [22], which showed that about 30% of signed domains do not upload DS records due to mismanagement by hosting service providers.

**STARTTLS**

- **SMTP Connection Issues**: Some 20 email servers block our connections in each round despite registering PTR records and sending not-spam requests. Figure 6 shows the fraction of established SMTP connections for which we cannot negotiate STARTTLS connections. On average, 0.22% of email servers do not implement STARTTLS, and 0.29% provide no or malformed certificates.

### Incorrect Components

#### 5.3 Incorrect Components

Providing a signed TLSA record, its DS record, and certificates via STARTTLS is not sufficient for proper DANE operation. The Certificate Association Data in TLSA records must be correct and consistent with the presented certificate.

- **DNSSEC Validation**: We use Unbound [76] to fetch and verify DNS records. Common reasons for validation failures include expired RRSIGs, inconsistent RRSIGs, and malformed RRSIGs.
- **Certificate Validation**: We build a validation program using the OpenSSL library to verify certificates based on the Certificate Usage in TLSA records. Common reasons for validation failures include mismatched Certificate Usage, Selector, Matching Type, or Certificate Association Data.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of validation failure reasons during our measurement period.
