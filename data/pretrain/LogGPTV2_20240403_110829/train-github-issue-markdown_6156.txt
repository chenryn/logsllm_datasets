I do a fair bit of editing in Markdown, and I like to hard-wrap blocks of text
at column 120 (as opposed to the visual wrapping that happens in VSCode based
on the editor.wrappingColumn setting).
It would be really helpful to have a visual guide at a user-defined column
number. This visual guide would affect nothing, it would merely appear as a
faintly visible vertical line that shows where the specified column is, such
as column 120. That way, when I'm writing large blocks of text, I don't have
to constantly look down to the column number indicator to see where I should
be hard-wrapping the text.
