and, thus, energy efﬁciency were greater than 99% of nodes
reached, for all conﬁgurations tested, and so are not shown
separately.
First we consider time efﬁciency: how fast
the ﬂood
spreads at different power levels. At higher transmission
power, transmission footprints are larger and so, not surpris-
ingly, the ﬂood spreads more quickly to reach all nodes. The
ﬂood initially spreads quickly, but the rate slows dramatically
at the end. Reaching the ﬁnal 5% of nodes takes 15% of the
total reception time for very low power to 34% of the total
reception time for very high power.
The disadvantage of large transmission footprints can be
seen in the ﬁnal row of Table IV: ﬂooding is much more
efﬁcient for very low power than for very high power
transmissions (71% vs 31%). The reason for this is because,
for the dense network topology tested, once the ﬂood has
reached all nodes, there is a long settling period for high
power ﬂoods in which nodes that have received, but not been
able to transmit, complete their transmissions. The energy
spent by nodes during this ﬁnal settling period is wasted
energy because the ﬂood message has already propagated to
all reachable nodes.
The total energy expended by network nodes is directly
proportional to the transmission energy used by each node
since each node receives and transmits exactly once during
the ﬂood. Thus, the higher the transmission power, the greater
the total energy usage of the network.
The ﬂooding protocol is not robust because some nodes
in the network may never receive the ﬂood message. This
can occur if every time one or more of a node’s neighbours
transmit a packet, a collision or corrupted signal occurs at
the receiving node’s cell. However, the robustness displayed
by each of the different power settings tested in this paper is
over 99%. For lower power transmissions or less dense node
topologies than those reported in this paper, robustness does
fall below 99%.
Balancing time and resource efﬁciency against robustness,
we choose to use medium transmission power in our remain-
ing ﬂooding experiments.
B. Varying Landscape Size
WSN applications currently deployed are relatively small,
using no more than 100 nodes (e.g. 32 nodes are used at
Duck Island [9]), but the vision of sensor network designers
is for networks of thousands of nodes, to be used to monitor
agricultural, environmental or man-made landscapes. How do
basic protocols, such as ﬂooding, scale up in large networks?
The purpose of this experiment is to explore the effect of
different network sizes on the performance of ﬂooding. For
the experiment, three network sizes are chosen: 169 nodes in
13x13 cells, 2500 nodes in 50x50 cells and 10,000 nodes in
100x100 cells. The same node density, of 1 node per 2 foot
by 2 foot landscape cell, is used in all three settings. Table V
shows the parameters used to conﬁgure the simulator.
The time efﬁciency and resource efﬁciency for each net-
work size is shown in Table VI. Again, robustness, and thus
energy efﬁciency, is above 99% for all conﬁgurations, and
so is not shown separately in the table.
Interestingly, the ﬂooding protocol scales very well be-
tween network sizes for the dense networks tested here. On
average, the ﬂood reaches all nodes in a similar number of
cycles for networks of 156 to 100000 nodes. However, the
variation in these measurements is much higher for smaller
networks. The overall time for nodes to complete the ﬂood
is longer for the larger networks and thus resource efﬁciency
is lower. Although the time to reach all nodes by ﬂood is, in
principle, proportional to the network diameter (i.e. apx 3,
12, 24 transmissions for the networks tested), the broadcast

storm problem [21] appears to be more pronounced in smaller
networks, and so, proportionally, ﬂooding performs worst in
small scale networks.
C. Varying Maximum Back-off
The amount of time that a node backs off before attempting
to send can have a signiﬁcant effect on relieving network
congestion and improving network throughput as a result.
The aim of this experiment is to look at the performance
improvements possible in WSNs by adjusting MAC layer
back-off.
As can be seen in Table VIII, different values of max-
imum back-off have little effect until 75% of nodes have
received the ﬂood. However, there are signiﬁcant time and
resource efﬁciency differences. Resource efﬁciency decreases
as maximum back-off increases because the number of cycles
used to cover the ﬁnal 5% is stretched when larger back-
offs are used. On the other hand, time efﬁciency improves
for larger back-offs because contention is reduced while the
ﬂood message is propagating. Thus there are trade-offs to be
made in selecting the best performance based on these two
performance indicators. Robustness is greater than 99% for
all levels; reducing contention by increasing back-off has a
minimal effect on robustness for this network conﬁguration.
D. Quantifying the Effect of Limited Resource
Our goal is to analyse the effect of the limited resources
of a wireless sensor network on the performance of that
network. In this section, we consider the effect of limited
radio transmission resource at each node. We compare the
performance of the ﬂooding algorithm using
• sparse footprints, as occurs in actual networks, with
• idealised, dense footprints, as used in many models of
wireless networks.
For comparison we chose dense footprints which reach ex-
actly the same number of cells as their (average) sparse coun-
terparts. For example, the medium sparse footprint reaches,
on average 113 cells, within an overall transmission radius of
12 cells. Its corresponding dense footprint is a disk of radius
6 cells with no noise. Table IX summarises the differences in
network performance for these two footprint models. At very
low and low powers, noisy footprints spread the ﬂood faster
and settle faster, than ﬂooding with an idealised, dense foot-
print. However, at medium, high and very high transmission
power, noisy footprints are slower to spread the ﬂood, and
slower to settle. Although the resource efﬁciency with noisy
footprints is usually higher than with ideal footprints, this
only occurs because time efﬁciency is much lower, and so the
overall performance of observed footprints is worse than for
idealised. That is, at low transmission powers, the resource
limitation of noisy footprints in wireless sensor networks
actually improves the performance of ﬂooding, whilst at high
transmission power, this resource limitation leads to worse
performance.
V. VALIDATION OF THE SIMULATOR MODEL AGAINST
EMPIRICAL DATA
In this section we compare our simulation results on
the performance of ﬂooding in WSNs with those with an
empirical study of ﬂooding in a 156 node sensor network [8].
These two studies have similar ﬁndings:
• As transmission power increases from very low to
very high, time efﬁciency increases too. Equivalently,
reception latency increases [8].
• As transmission power increases from very low to
very high, resource efﬁciency falls. Equivalently, as
transmission power increases the percentage of useless
retransmissions rises [8]. Efﬁciency falls from around
70% to 30% in both studies.
• Robustness is over 99%, but not 100%, for a dense
network topology of 1 node per 2ft by 2ft cell for all
transmission powers. The percentage of nodes which
received the ﬂood is not reported in the empirical
study [8] but was most likely 100% for the 4 to 7 runs
observed at each power setting.
