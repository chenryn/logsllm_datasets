Hello,  
today, I was upgrading deno with `deno upgrade` and my antivirus (Avast) made
popups. One of them said something like _We've protected **deno.exe** because
it was acting suspiciously._ and _Threat blocked. We've blocked
**UNP244220764.TMP** because we've founded that it's infected by
**IDP.HELU.PSD11**_ (I don't have Avast in english so it can be slightly
different).  
Can someone explain me what's going on? Is deno virus or not?  
Thanks
