Subject: Issue with `ask_sudo_password` after upgrading Ansible to 1.9.0.1

Hi,

I recently upgraded Ansible to version 1.9.0.1, and I am encountering an issue with the `ask_sudo_password` functionality. The server is now prompting for a sudo password, which was not the case in earlier versions (1.8.2, 1.8.4).

**Environment:**
- **Ansible Host:** Arch Linux
- **Target System:** CentOS 6

**Configuration:**
- `sudo_user = root`
- `sudo = True`
- `# ask_sudo_pass = True` (commented out)
- `become = False`
- `# become_method = 'sudo'` (commented out)
- `become_user = ''`
- `# become_ask_pass = False` (commented out, to address issue #10547)

**Playbook Configuration:**
```yaml
...
sudo: True
...
```

**Command:**
```bash
ansible -m setup -K
```

**Error:**
```
SUDO password:
xxxxxx server xxxxxx | FAILED => ssh connection closed waiting for a privilege escalation password prompt
```

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
