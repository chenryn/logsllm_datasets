Hi,
After I've upgraded ansible to ansible 1.9.0.1, i've got a problem with
ask_sudo_password.  
(server asks for sudo password)
(ansible runs on arch linux, the target system is CentOS6)  
With earlier versions of ansible (1.8.2, 1.8.4) runs fine
My settings:  
sudo_user = root  
sudo = True
# ask_sudo_pass = True
become=False
# become_method='sudo'
become_user=''
# become_ask_pass=False
(to fix problem in issue #10547)
In playbook:  
...  
sudo: True  
...
and the command:  
ansible -m setup -K  
SUDO password:  
xxxxxx server xxxxxx | FAILED => ssh connection closed waiting for a privilege
escalation password prompt
