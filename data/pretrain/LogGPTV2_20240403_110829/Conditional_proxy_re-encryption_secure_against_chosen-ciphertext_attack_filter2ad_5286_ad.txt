We proceed to analyze the simulation of the re-encryption
oracle. The responses to adversary A’s re-encryption queries
are perfect, unless A can submit valid original ciphertexts
without querying hash function H1(denote this event by
ReEncErr). However, since H1 acts as a random oracle and
adversary A issues at most qre re-encryption queries, we have
Pr[ReEncErr] ≤ qre
q .
Now, we evaluate the simulation of the decryption oracle.
ReEncErr ∨ DecErr)˛˛¬Abort.
Let DecErr be the event that Valid|¬AskH2 happens during
the entire simulation. Then, since qd decryption oracles are
issued, we have Pr[DecErr] ≤ qH1 qd

q .

Now let Good denote the event (AskH∗
2) ∨
If event Good does not hap-
pen, due to the randomness of the output of the random
oracle H2, it is clear that adversary A can not gain any
advantage greater than 1
2 in guessing δ. Namely, we have
Pr[δ = δ(cid:48)|¬Good] = 1
2 . Hence, by splitting Pr[δ(cid:48) = δ], we
have

This completes the proof of Lemma 1.
Next, we prove that under the 2-QBDH assumption, there
exists no Type II IND-CPRE-CCA adversary A against our
scheme with non-negligible probability. Note that the 2-
QBDH assumption is weaker than the 3-QBDH assumption
and is implied by the latter.

then there exists an algorithm B which can solve the (t(cid:48), (cid:48))-

5. EXTENSIONS
In this section, we extend our C-PRE scheme to obtain a
conditional proxy re-encryption system with multiple con-
ditions (MC-PRE). In a MC-PRE system, the proxy with a
partial re-encryption key rki,j can translate ciphertexts as-
sociated with a set of conditions {wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn} from user
Ui to user Uj, if and only if he has all the condition keys
{cki,wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn} with respect to these conditions.
Based on the C-PRE scheme in Section 4.1, we present a
MC-PRE scheme. The proposed MC-PRE scheme consists
of seven algorithms, where GlobalSetup, KeyGen, RKeyGen
and CKeyGen are the same as those in the C-PRE scheme,
and the other three algorithms are speciﬁed as below:
Encrypt(pk, m,{wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn}): On input a public key pk =
(P, Q), a plaintext m ∈ {0, 1}l0 and a set of conditions
{wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn}, this algorithm works as below:
1. Pick r(cid:48) $← {0, 1}l1 and compute r = H1(m, r(cid:48),{wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn}).
2. Compute A = gr

, and

t∈{k1,··· ,kn}
D =

3. Output the original ciphertext CT = (A, B, C, D).
ReEncrypt(CTi, rki,j,{cki,wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn}): On input a ci-
phertext CTi associated with a set of conditions {wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn}
under public key pki, a partial re-encryption key rki,j
and a set of condition key {cki,wt}t∈{k1,··· ,kn}, it gen-
erates the ciphertext under key pkj as follows:
Interestingly, the number of bilinear pairings needed in the
above MC-PRE scheme is independent of the number of con-
ditions, and the eﬃciency of this MC-PRE scheme is com-
parable to that of the C-PRE scheme in Section 4.1.
Similarly to the C-PRE scheme, the chosen-ciphertext se-
curity of the proposed scheme can be proved under the 3-
QBDH assumption. Of course, the security model should
be slightly modiﬁed to address the situations under multi-
ple conditions. Due to the space limit, we omit the security
model and proofs.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS
In this paper, we tackle the problem of how to control the
proxy in PRE systems at a ﬁne-grained level. We intro-
duce the concept of conditional proxy re-encryption. We
formalize its deﬁnition and its security notions, and propose
a CCA-secure C-PRE scheme. We further extend this C-
PRE scheme to support multiple conditions with reasonable
overhead. The conditions in our proposed solution are lim-
ited to keywords. It remains as an interesting open problem
how to construct CCA-secure C-PRE schemes with anony-
mous conditions or boolean predicates.
