chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) was used for profiling lipid soluble metabolites Principal component analysis 
clearly showed four groups: adipose tissue, tumor tissue, IgG4-ROD, and MALT lymphoma Comparison between orbital adipose tissues and 
matched samples showed significant differences in 174 and 132 metabolites in IgG4-ROD and MALT lymphoma, respectively Comparison between 
IgG4-ROD and MALT lymphoma showed significant differences in 12 metabolites These tissue-specific difference would help understanding the 
pathogenesis of these diseases

Rapid assessment of radiation signatures in noninvasive biofluids may aid in assigning proper medical treatments for acute radiation syndrome 
(ARS) and delegating limited resources after a nuclear disaster Metabolomic platforms allow for rapid screening of biofluid signatures and show 
promise in differentiating radiation dose and time post-exposure Here, we use global metabolomics to differentiate temporal effects found in 
nonhuman primate (NHP) urine and serum small molecule signatures after a 4 Gy total body gamma irradiation Random Forests analysis show 
days (1 – 60) after a 4 Gy exposure can be readily separated and provide critical information for ARS treatment Eight compounds involved 
in protein metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, DNA base deamination, and general energy metabolism were identified in each biofluid The 
greatest perturbations were seen at 1 d in urine highlighted by increases in carnitine, acylcarnitines, xanthine, creatine, 7-methylguanine, and 
dimethylarginine Changes in serum metabolite concentrations were more dynamic (1 – 21 d) including carnitine, acylcarnitines, guanine, oleamide, 
and hypoxanthine We also developed a targeted multiplex assay validating a six compound panel (hypoxanthine, carnitine, acetylcarnitine, proline, 
taurine, and citrulline) previously identified in a training cohort at 7 d after a 4 Gy exposure Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis 
indicated the highest sensitivity and specificity for carnitine and acetylcarnitine (urine, area under the curve [AUC] = 099) and taurine, carnitine, and 
hypoxanthine (serum, AUC = 095) These results highlight the utility of mass spectrometry (MS) platforms to differentiate time post-exposure and 
acquire reliable quantitative biomarker panels for classifying exposed individuals

Metabolic profiling of biofluids by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy serves as an important tool in disease characterization, 
and its accuracy largely depends on the quality of the samples We aimed to explore possible effects of repeated freeze and thaw cycles (FTCs) 
on concentrations of lipoprotein parameters in serum and metabolite concentrations in serum and urine samples Serum and urine samples 
were collected from two sets of 20 healthy donors, and aliquots were subjected to 1–5 FTCs Samples were subsequently analyzed by NMR 
spectroscopy, and lipoprotein parameters and metabolites were quantified using a commercial analytical platform In total, 112 lipoprotein 
parameters, and 20 serum and 35 urine metabolites were quantified Principal component analysis showed no systematic changes related to FTCs 
Samples from the same donor were closely clustered, showing a higher between-subject variation than within-subject variation The coefficients of 
variation were small (<21%, <14% and <22% for lipoprotein parameters, and serum and urine metabolites, respectively), showing a low variation in 
samples from the same donor Systematic effects of FTCs on the concentrations were tested by Wilcoxon tests between consecutive FTCs Only five 
lipoprotein parameters (VLCH, VLFC, V1CH, V4CH, and V3FC) differed significantly between FTC 3 and 4 (p-values<005), while other lipoprotein 
and metabolite concentrations showed no significant change In conclusion, five FTCs did not significantly alter the concentrations of serum and 
urine metabolites, and introduced only minimal changes to serum lipoprotein parameters evaluated by the NMR- based platform

CO-AUTHORS: H. S. Jónasdóttir, R. S. Sigurðardóttir S. Halldórsson, G. G. Haraldsson, Óttar Rolfsson
Acellular fish skin (ACS) has emerged as a dermal substitute used to promote wound healing The effects of ACS have been associated to the 
poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) although their presence in processed ACS has not yet been determined Here, we compared the total free 
fatty acid (FFA) and lipid profiles of ACS to that of human cadaver skin (HCS) and two grafts of bovine origin FFA quantification was performed by 
GC-FID and the lipid profile analysis by untargeted UPLC-MS/MS Our results showed that ACS contained significantly higher omega3 FAs and 
PUFA than all other tested grafts, with percentages that exceeded 20% and 30% of the total FAs content respectively The majority of the PUFAs 
found in HCS were omega-6 while the two grafts of bovine origin presented insignificant PUFA amounts Regarding the grafts´ lipidomic profile, 
both unsupervised PCA and supervised PLS analysis demonstrated that all analyzed materials had very different lipid composition Based on 
the heatmap and the hierarchical clustering, approximately 50 lipids from positive and negative ESI mode were identified as the most distinctive 
between the four materials and their possible structure was annotated Further analysis of the lipid profiles demonstrated that phosphatidylcholine 
containing 20:5 and 22:6 omega3 PUFAs were characteristic for the ACS grafts Our study showed that the lipid and fatty acid content of the ACS 
is different to other wound grafting materials The high omega3 PUFA found may be associated with a range of positive wound healing mechanisms 
including anti-inflammatory activity, cell migration and stimulation

Improving the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease by Establishing a Mass Spectrometric 
Reference Measurement Procedure for Parathyroid Hormone
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Candice Ulmer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Hubert Vesper
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a key biomarker for chronic kidney diseases, one of the leading health conditions in the USA In addition, the 
measurement of parathyroid hormone (PTH) along with the respective fragmented versions of this hormone in serum and/or plasma is necessary 
for the detection, diagnosis, and prevention of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D disorders Current quantitation approaches suffer from sensitivity, 
PTH instability, and method measurement variability CDC’s PTH standardization program is improving the accuracy and reliability of measurements 
performed in patient care A reference measurement procedure was developed for the quantitation of intact PTH (1-84) and select PTH fragments 
in serum Stable isotope labeled internal standards were spiked prior to sample preparation PTH isolation was optimized using immunocapture 
methodologies with monoclonal antibodies The UHPLC-HRMS-based reference procedure allows for the highly specific detection and quantitation 
of intact PTH (z=6) without isotopic interference from the labeled internal standard Preliminary results demonstrate the ability to quantify intact PTH 
and PTH fragments within a 5-ppm mass accuracy window without enzymatic digestion Calibration curves using stable isotope labeled internal 
standards were generated for iPTH, N-terminal PTH fragments, C-terminal PTH fragments, and mid-region PTH fragments Initial assessments 
demonstrate excellent linearity (R2 = 0991-0997), reproducibility, and sufficient sensitivity of the UHPLC-HRMS system with a linear range of 15-
3000 pg/mL PTH This method was applied to samples from healthy patients and patients with different CKD stages PTH and its fragments were 
detectable in these samples

Metabolic profiling of renal cystic fluids in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease patients
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Woori Chae, Seoul National University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Hyunjin Ryu, Seung Seok Han, Joo-Youn Cho
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder resulted from mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 genes It occurs in about 
1 in 400 to 1000 and is the fourth leading cause of end-stage renal disease Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist, is the first line treatment 
for ADPKD but there are various known side effects Currently, no drug has been developed to inhibit the formation and development of polycysts 
In this study, we compared the metabolic profiles of renal cyst fluids obtained from patients with ADPKD and those with simple cysts as a control 
to find a new therapeutic target Differences in metabolite profiles according to various clinical parameters were also compared in ADPKD patients 
Fifteen cyst fluids from ADPKD patients and twenty-seven cyst fluid from patients with simple cysts were collected and analyzed with both reverse 
phase and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography column using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight 
mass spectrometry Though we did not find any significant differences between ADPKD and simple cyst groups, several statistically significant 
metabolites were found in ADPKD patients according to the incidence of advanced chronic kidney disease It was the first report of comparative 
human metabolome profile of ADPKD and simple cyst fluids, which may contribute to understanding the pathogenesis of ADPKD

Honeybee venom is a natural product that pose danger to human health, but also have therapeutic properties Peptides and proteins constitute 
the majority of its dry mass However, there are also multiple low-molecular-weight compounds present in honeybee venom, which have various 
biological functions The aim of the study was to identify and quantify the metabolites present in that bee product A quadrupole-Orbitrap mass 
spectrometer coupled to a liquid chromatograph was used for untargeted metabolomics Moreover, two targeted methodologies were applied that 
utilized a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a liquid chromatograph Polar metabolites (amino acids, biogenic amines, organic acids) 
were determined with chromatographic separation, while lipid metabolites were analyzed using flow injection analysis The untargeted research 
allowed to identify several dozens of metabolites present in honeybee venom, which belong to such classes as: amino acids, catecholamines, 
organic acids, fatty acids, purines, pyrimidines and saccharides 42 metabolites were quantified using targeted platforms Among metabolites 
determined in the highest amount were citric acid, glycine, proline, dopamine and histamine The research revealed that honeybee venom is a 
highly complex matrix not only in relation to proteins, but also to metabolites Moreover, the variability in the composition of venom was observed 
Factors influencing the changes in venom composition need to be studied and the composition need to be controlled, ia in order to ensure the 
safety of using venom as a product for medical formulations The project received support from the National Science Centre, Poland (grant number: 
2016/23/D/NZ7/03949)

Peripheral vs. Cord blood: assessment of inflammatory, growth factors and metabolomic profile for the production of  
serum eye drops
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Thelma Pertinhez, University of Parma, Dept. Medicine and Surgery, Italy
CO-AUTHORS: Manuela Guardi, Lucia Merolle, Chiara Marraccini, Roberto Baricchi
Dry Eye Disease is characterized by tear increased osmolality and inflammation Serum eye drops have emerged as a therapy for these ocular 
surface disorders (1) The rationale for the topical use of serum drops is based on their composition similarity to tears, due to the presence of growth 
factors, cytokines and vitamins, essential to maintain corneal homeostasis and wellness Given the lack of guidelines for serum drops production, 
our aim was to compare the inflammatory, growth factors and metabolomic profiles from two homologous blood sources: cord blood serum (CBS) 
and adult peripheral blood serum (PBS), in order to pave the way for a standardization preparations procedure This study involved S Orsola-
Malpighi Teaching Hospital (Bologna) and Azienda USL-IRCCS di Reggio Emilia Metabolomics was performed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
and Luminex Assay was used to measure cytokines and growth factors Over 40 metabolites were identified and quantified We found significant 
differences between the two blood-derived serum drops, with higher concentration of metabolites in CBS than PBS The main differences were 
in choline, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and glucose levels As expected CBS showed higher concentration of TGF-α, β-NGF, FGF levels with 
respect to PBS Inflammation pathway was not stimulated in CBS and nor in PBS These results indicate that both products are safe, although 
the high level of TGF-α might be dangerous for patient with neoplastic disease 1 Hessen M, Akpek EK J Ophthalmic Vis Res 2014, 9:240-50

CO-AUTHORS: Marcela Konjevod, Alberto Bergareche, Pilar Amiano, Fernando Goñi, Eva Ardanaz, José María Huerta, Coral Barbas
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an age-related, debilitating, severe neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic 
neurons The identification of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PD could improve treatment and decrease misdiagnosis The aim of this study 
was to develop and validate LC-MS/MS methods that will allow to find compounds that could represent potential biomarkers The study enrolled 
plasma samples as part of “The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition” study that were collected from healthy donors, 
who were followed up for 15 years Among them, some developed PD in the following years These samples are of great value for the discovery 
of biomarkers for the early diagnosis of PD and makes this study a high risk project involving the validation of biomarkers in healthy subjects 
The analytes were chosen according to findings in previous studies on Parkinson’s disease to be measured in target 5 methods were developed 
in LC-QqQ-MS for the quantitation of groups according to their chemical characteristics The methods were validated in terms of linearity, LOQ, 
repeatability, intermediate precision and stability The LOQ for most of the compounds were below 500 ppb The results showed good intermediate 
precision (18-324 %RSD), repeatability (03-102 %RSD) and stability at 4º C, as well as at room temperature for the analyzed compounds 
Recoveries were found to be between 40 and 100 % Statistically significant compounds belonged to the groups of fatty acids, sugars, alcohols and 
organic acids

Identification of chronic kidney disease patients at risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is essential for treatment decision-making 
and clinical trial design Here [1], we explored whether proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of blood plasma improves the 
currently best performing kidney failure risk equation, the so-called Tangri score Our study cohort comprised 4640 participants from the German 
Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study, of whom 185 (399%) progressed over a mean observation time of 370 ± 088 years to ESRD requiring either 
dialysis or transplantation The original four-variable Tangri risk equation yielded a C statistic of 0863 (95% CI, 0831–0900) Upon inclusion of 
NMR features by state-of-the-art machine learning methods, the C statistic improved to 0875 (95% CI, 0850–0911), thereby outperforming the 
Tangri score in 94 out of 100 subsampling rounds Of the 24 NMR features included in the model, creatinine, high-density lipoprotein, valine, acetyl 
groups of glycoproteins, and Ca2+-EDTA carried the highest weights In conclusion, proton NMR-based plasma fingerprinting improved markedly 
the detection of patients at risk of developing ESRD, thus enabling enhanced patient treatment [1] Zacharias, et al, A Novel Metabolic Signature To

Natural products are attractive as drug leads Traditional herbal medicine (THM) is expected to overcome the limitations of a single chemical 
agent, and is prescribed by over 80% of medical doctors in Japan together with Western drugs To elucidate their molecular action, comprehensive 
profiling of the THM components and their bio-conversion is essential We present a data-independent (non-targeted) strategy, named DAC-Met 
(Differential Annotation of Converted Metabolites), to explore metabolized plasma components using high-resolution mass spectrometry As 
a showcase, we chose the effect of “maoto”, a mixture of ephedra herb, apricot kernel, cinnamon bark, and glycyrrhiza root, widely prescribed 
for febrile symptoms including fever and influenza in Asian countries Maoto was administered to four healthy volunteers Blood samples were 
collected before and after the maoto treatment, 7-time points in total We performed plasma metabolome analyses and found maoto-derived 
metabolites, including known major components (ephedrine, prunasin, cinnamic acid, and glycyrrhetinic acid) Using the mass difference of major 
bio-conversions, we additionally estimated the structure of 11 unidentified metabolites, and 4 were later confirmed with authentic standards With 
literature knowledge, we also reconstructed the metabolic pathway of maoto components From time-resolved measurements, their kinetic profiles 
became clear too: many showed rapid absorption and elimination but glycyrrhetinic acid and related conjugates became prominent 4 hours after 
administration The converted metabolites and their diverse kinetics revealed in this study exemplify the complex mechanism of THM action This 
talk covers detailed strategy of our differential analysis and the future prospect of natural product research

Lipidome modules underlying subclinical osteoporosis and atherosclerosis comorbidity: The Cardiovascular Risk in  
Young Finns Study
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Binisha Hamal Mishra, Tampere University, Finland
CO-AUTHORS: Pashupati P. Mishra, Nina Mononen, Mika Kähönen Olli T. Raitakari, Reijo Laaksonen, Terho Lehtimäki
Background: Evidences suggest that atherosclerosis and osteoporosis are comorbid conditions However, the underlying mechanism is largely 
unknown Subjects and methods: System-level analysis of untargeted serum lipidome was performed to identify networks of lipid species 
underlying atherosclerosis and osteoporosis comorbidity The study is based on Young Finns Study cohort from 2007 follow-up (number:1194, 
age:30-45 years, women:5930%) Carotid and bulbus intima media thickness was used as proxy for subclinical atherosclerosis Total mineral 
density and area of heel bone, distal radius, distal radius spongy bone, radial shaft cortical bone, distal tibia, distal tibia spongy bone and tibial shaft 
cortical bone were used as proxy for subclinical osteoporosis Co-expression network analysis was performed to identify modules of interconnected 
lipid species Expression profiles in modules were summarized by first principal component termed as module eigenlipid Lipid modules that were 
significantly correlated with both bone and artery variables were considered to be related to comorbidity Results: A module with 124 lipid species 
was significantly associated with both artery (Pearson correlation: 016, p-value: 6e-08) and bone variables (Pearson correlation: 023, p-value: 
1e-15) Majority of the lipid species in the module belonged to classes glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid Glycerolipids were found 
statistically most strongly associated with the comorbidity The identified module contained high-risk ceramides that confirms previously suggested 
association between ceramides and cardiovascular outcomes, and suggests its potential role in subclinical osteoporosis Conclusion: This study 
identified a lipid module associated with subclinical phase of atherosclerosis and osteoporosis comorbidity and provides potential biomarker for the 
comorbidity diagnosis

LC-MS analysis of free fatty acids in acromegaly patients
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Bettina Gürtl, CeMM - Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Paul Fellinger, Yvonne Winhofer-Stöckl, Kristaps Klavins
Acromegaly is a rare disease resulting from an overproduction of growth hormone which leads to changes in the physical appearance and inner 
organs Acromegaly patients also display an extremely low hepatocellular lipid content, despite pronounced insulin resistance Therefore, studying 
acromegaly may help to elucidate underlying antisteatotic pathways in non-fatty liver disease Fatty acids play an essential role in lipogenesis and 
hence free fatty acid levels and distributions could be used to reflect alterations in these pathways In this work a comprehensive analysis of free 
fatty acids in plasma samples from acromegaly patients was performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) The analysis of fatty 
acids is often conducted by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry due to the low chromatographic performance and ionization efficiency of 
LC-MS To overcome these challenges, a chemical derivatization reaction, based on 2-hydrazinoquinoline was established The sample preparation 
was optimized by testing different extraction solvents, evaluating the influence of used consumables and investigating different durations of the 
derivatization reaction For the LC-MS analysis a reversed phase chromatographic separation coupled to a high resolution mass spectrometer was 
used The developed method provides a comprehensive coverage of 25 fatty acids including short- and long-chain fatty acids Plasma samples from 
15 patients with active acromegaly and 17 healthy controls, matched for age, BMI, gender and body composition (fat free mass), were analyzed using 
the established workflow The obtained quantitative profiles of free fatty acids showed that the concentration of the majority of detected free fatty 
acids was lower in acromegaly patients

Fish mucus collection strategies for metabolomics: a distinct response to Aqui-S and benzocaine anaesthetics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lada Ivanova, Norwegian Veterinary Institute, Norway
CO-AUTHORS: Rangel-Huerta, O.D., Tartor, H., Gjessing, M.C., Dahle, M.K., Thoen, E., Uhlig, S.
Fish mucus has recently received significant interest in aquaculture Mucus on accessible/reachable mucosal surfaces including skin and gills can 
be collected in a simple and non-invasive manner, providing the relevant information about the health status of the fish However, the sampling 
approach may be challenging source of bias in comparative metabolomics of fish skin and gill mucus Therefore, standardisation of sampling 
procedures, as well as increasing the understanding of potential sources of error are highly valuable Different anaesthetics facilitate work with fish 
and reduce the level of stress, respecting the refining principle of using fish as laboratory animals The addition of anaesthetics to the water is a 
common procedure prior to sampling in aquaculture There is also a trend towards reducing the use of synthetic anaesthetics to avoid unwanted 
effects on the environment Therefore, there is a growing interest in the use of natural products such as clove oil (Aqui-S) as a viable alternative to 
synthetic anaesthesia This study aims to explore the effect of Aqui-S and benzocaine on the composition of the skin and gill mucus obtained after 
sedation of the fish By using targeted and untargeted metabolomics, alterations in the metabolome of fish mucus induced by both anaesthetics 
have been evaluated The results will be used further to improve experimental designs used in metabolomics, realising such alterations
