Users
The ArcSight UBA application provides security professionals with relevant intelligence regarding the risk posture of the organization. Users interacting with the organization’s IT assets are a corner-stone of the platform. The entire purpose of information security is to detect and prevent rogue users from conducting harmful activities that may damage the well-being of the organization.Users, in the context of the application, refers to all users interacting with the IT infrastructure of the organization, which may be employees, contractors, temporary workers, partners, vendors, sup-pliers, and even customers.
This section also allows security administrators to view user identity, access and activity data, peer group memberships, and behavioral profiles of individuals, and to modify imported user identities within the ArcSight UBA application.Before you can view and manage users, you must import user data into ArcSight UBA. To import user data, refer to User Data in the ArcSight UBA Administration Guide.
After importing user data, navigate to Menu > Views > Users to view and manage user identities.
By default, the list is sorted by Employee ID in ascending order. Click a column heading to sort the list in ascending order by that attribute.ArcSight User Behavior Analytics 6.10User Guide 	Page 268 of318

	Note: The column headings may vary depending on the attributes mapped when importing

Peer Groups
A user may belong to one or multiple Peer Groups. These Peer Groups are typically based on user HR attributes such as job code, title, manager. The application uses peer groups to compare the user’s access and activities and determine outlier behavior or anomalies.From this screen, you can add peer groups for the user you're viewing or select one or more peer groups to remove.

Monitor Activities
Monitor Activities allows you to view all activities performed by a user across all resources for a selec-ted period.Click on any data point or field to filter events, enter a custom Spotter query, or export the search res-ults as Reports. For information about how to search events and what actions you can take on this screen, see Spotter.
Behavior ProfileArcSight UBA generates behavior profiles for users. These behavior profiles are very comprehensive and can store up to 120 characteristics for each user. The behavior characteristics include: time slices, activity, and IP address/hostname. Behavior profiles are used to establish a baseline of beha-vior for a user based on the selected characteristics to determine when the user conducts abnormal or outlier behavior that indicates a threat. For a detailed discussion of Behavior Profiles and why to use them, see Behavior Profiles in the ArcSight UBA Administration Guide.You can perform the following actions on this screen:
Select a policy for which you want to view the Behavior Profile from the dropdown.
The screen displays activity for the selected account held by the user on the resource. You can view activity for a different account from the Resource dropdown.

Editing Users
Administrative users can make changes to individual users or groups of users.
 Note: To maintain integrity of user data, any changes to user information should be made in the source application (HR data source), and then those changes imported into ArcSight
UBA from the source using a data feed. If users are updated in ArcSight UBA, and a newdata feed is imported from the source application, the latest information from the source will
overwrite any manual changes made in ArcSight UBA.
Manage Bulk Changes to Users
To manage bulk changes to users, navigate to Menu > Views > Users.
From the Users screen, you can search for specific users using either a simple or advanced user
search. See Performing User Searches for details.To select individual users, click the check boxes on the left side of each user you want to edit or

PeersViews
Peers
A Peer Group is a grouping of users that perform similar job functions. Peer Groups can be created using any of the user attributes. You can define any number of peer groups and assign any number of users to peer groups.Peer Groups are created to manage access outliers, access logs, and activity logs of the users that belong to a particular peer group. Users are assigned to one or multiple peer groups based on their identity attributes. Each peer group contains additional sets of users with access privileges assigned to each of them. Each access privilege held by a user is compared with all the members of each Peer Group to determine the number of users that hold the same access privilege. The greater the number of users that hold the same entitlement, the lower the probability of the access privilege being an outlier. The entitlement is determined to be an outlier if it crosses a threshold. Each user within the Peer Group may have one or multiple access privileges that are outliers. The greater the number of access privileges that are outliers, the higher the overall access risk for the user.There are three ways to create new peer groups:
l Peer Creation Rules: Create Peer Groups using HR attributes and assign users based on selec-	tion criteria.
l Peer Assignment Rules: Assigns users to the appropriate Peer Groups based on the criteria 	specified.
For additional information, see Peer Groups in the ArcSight UBA Administration Guide.
