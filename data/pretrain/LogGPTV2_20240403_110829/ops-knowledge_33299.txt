I am using a Raspberry Pi 3 to communicate with an Android app via WebSocket. I installed Tornado on my Raspberry Pi, and the installation was successful. However, I encounter an issue when using it with Python 3. When I try to import Tornado in Python 3 by writing `import tornado`, I receive an `ImportError: No module named 'tornado'`. This suggests that Tornado is installed for Python 2.7 but not for Python 3. Both Python 2 and Python 3 are pre-installed on my Raspberry Pi.

Could someone please help me resolve this issue? Thank you in advance.

P.S. Apologies for any grammatical errors; English is not my first language.

And here’s a refined version of the response:

It appears that the Tornado website is currently experiencing some issues. As a workaround, I downloaded the `tar.gz` file from an alternative source and installed Tornado from there. To ensure that Tornado is installed for Python 3, make sure to use the `python3` command instead of `python` during the installation process.

For example, you can install Tornado for Python 3 using the following commands:
```sh
wget https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/archive/refs/tags/v6.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf v6.1.tar.gz
cd tornado-6.1
python3 setup.py install
```

This should resolve the `ImportError` you are encountering.
