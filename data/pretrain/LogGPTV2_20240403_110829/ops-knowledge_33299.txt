User: I'm using raspberry pi 3 to communicate with an android app through websocket. I installed tornado on my raspberry and the installation was succesfull but if I use it with python 2.7 I haven't any kind of problem but I need to use it with python 3 and when I just write "import tornado" I get an ImportError: No module named "tornado". It is like if it is installed in python 2 but not in 3. Both python 2 and 3 are preinstalled on raspberry. Somebody can help me? Thanks in advance
Sorry for my bad english
Assistant: In these days the website of tornado has some problem. I downloaded the tar.gz file from another website and installed from there. Instead of use command "python" use "python3"
