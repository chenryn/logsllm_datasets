User: If I start python under MacOS X 10.8 in the console it starts with "Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 20 2012, 16:23:33) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-418.0.60)] on darwin".
In what way does the implementation of python depend on GCC?
Assistant: Python is implemented in C, and records what version of the C compiler was used to compile it (to aid tracking down compiler-specific bugs).
The implementation itself does not vary based on the compiler. It can vary based on the platform it is compiled for, and the available external libraries, but there is nothing altering Python behaviour based on the compiler used.
