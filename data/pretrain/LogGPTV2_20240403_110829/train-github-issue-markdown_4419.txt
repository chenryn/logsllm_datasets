The spring test infrastructure no longer honour prototype-scoped beans if they
are injected wiht `@Resource`. It does work with `@Autowired`.
We suspect that #13814 may have brought this regression.
To reproduce, extract the zip and run the tests (either from your IDE or on
the command line with Maven). You can validate the regression by running the
following command:
    mvn clean install -Dspring.version=3.1.1.RELEASE
