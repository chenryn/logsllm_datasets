User: How to regularly backup MySQL database on Linux server? Please provide backup scheme and tool selection.
Assistant: Backup plan: 1. Regular full backup 2. Regular incremental backup tool selection: 1. mysqldump: MySQL has its own backup tool, which can back up the entire database or a single table, and supports compression. Regular backups can be implemented through scheduled tasks. 2. xtrabackup: A backup and recovery tool based on the InnoDB storage engine, which can perform incremental and full backups. 3. Percona Toolkit: A suite of MySQL management tools that includes several utilities, including backup and recovery tools. Incremental and full backups are available. It is recommended to use xtrabackup because it supports incremental backup, fast backup speed, and supports both physical backup and logical backup.
