User: There are some posts on SO and tell me to use fab-script.py as startup script for pycharm. It's exactly what I used before. Now when I upgrade fabric to latest version, fab-script disappeared, and only fab.exe left there. I tried a lot of  other ways, but still failed to launch debugger in pycharm.
Assistant: I haven't used this setup on Windows, but on Linux/Mac, it's fairly straightforward:

Create a new Run Configuration in PyCharm for a Python script (when you click the "+" button, select the one labelled "Python")
The "Configuration" tab should be open.
For the "Script" field, enter the full path to fab.exe, like C:\Python27\.....\fab.exe or whatever it is.
For Script parameters, just try -l, to list the available commands. You'll tweak this later, and fill it in with whatever tasks you'd run from the command line, like "fab   etc..."
For the "Working directory" field, you'll want to set that to the directory that contains your fabfile.

And it's about as easy as that, at least on *nix. Sorry that I don't have a Windows setup, but do let us know if you do have any issues with the setup described above.
