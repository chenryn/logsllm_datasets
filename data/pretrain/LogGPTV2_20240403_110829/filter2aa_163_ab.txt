#### Core Badge Functionality
- **Glyph Selection**:
  - Choose your favorite 4 glyphs/icons to show on the LCD.
  - Enter Glyph Selection mode by pressing SW2 from the DEFCON logo.
  - Use SW1 and SW2 to cycle through the glyphs.
  - Press SW1 and SW2 together to select the glyph.

- **LCD Control API**:
  - Control the LCD via serial commands sent over the USB virtual COM port.
  - Use a terminal program or scripts.
  - Display graphics and text on the LCD.
  - No hardware hacking experience necessary.

  **Commands**:
  - `#` to enable mode.
  - `C` to clear frame buffer.
  - `L aa aa vv` to load byte `vv` into frame buffer location `aa`.
  - `U` to update the LCD with frame buffer contents.
  - `X` (or power cycle) to exit LCD mode.

- **Secret Modes**:
  - Hidden code and data in the badge.
  - Find all the cool stuff!

- **Development Environment**:
  - **Freescale CodeWarrior for 56800/E Digital Signal Controllers**:
    - Special Edition free for up to 64KB Flash.
    - Windows only, but works fine in a VM.
    - All tools/materials on DEFCON CD.
    - [http://tinyurl.com/mc56f8006-dev/](http://tinyurl.com/mc56f8006-dev/)

  - **Processor Expert**:
    - GUI for peripheral configuration.
    - Generates required drivers/function code for desired modules.

- **Static Serial Bootloader**:
  - Load your own firmware onto the badge using the USB port and a terminal program.
  - Hold down SW1 & SW2 on power-up.
  - Virtual USB COM port will appear on your machine.
  - Use CodeWarrior dev. tools to hack/modify firmware and re-compile.

- **In Case of Bricking**:
  - Use the MC56F8006 JTAG interface.
  - Engineers are standing by in the Hardware Hacking Village.
  - Use the 56800E Flash Programmer tool to reload original firmware.

- **Converting BMP to C**:
  - Load your own graphics onto the badge.
  - Requires Kent Display development tools (on CD).
  - Convert BMP to array and replace the one(s) in `graphics.h`.

- **Power Consumption**:
  - Idle (Wait): 0.7mA
  - Active (LCD update): 8.3mA @ 930mS
  - Serial port TX: 6.7mA

- **Seamless Power Switching**:
  - P-channel MOSFET on by default via R4.
  - When USB is plugged in, 3V3OUT (FT232) goes HIGH.
  - MOSFET turns off and battery is isolated from the circuit.
  - Body diode of MOSFET prevents battery from getting reverse fed by 3V3OUT.

- **Badge Hacking Contest**:
  - Submit your entry to Kingpin starting at 2pm Sunday in the HHV.
  - Previous results at [www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/defcon-1x-badge/](http://www.grandideastudio.com/portfolio/defcon-1x-badge/) (x = 4, 5, 6, 7).
