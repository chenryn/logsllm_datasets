User: I seem to be in a never ending tail spin of Linux, or not, Windows or not. Web programming or system programming. Python or PHP.
I'am self teaching myself programming. But it seems I keep being torn about which way to go. Unfortunately it is always seemingly good reasons to get side tracked. You know the whole open source or proprietary thing. Lately I have decided after a year that Linux just doesn't cut it for me and it mostly stems from me wanting to watch videos on Channel 9 etc, and the clunkiness that is Linux. So that lead me to, "Should I learn ASP.NET, since I am more so deciding Windows IS a "necessary" evil.
I hope this made sense. The reason I settled in on Web Development as my course to learning programming is because I actually have a task to implement rather then aimlessly reading reference books etc.
Does anyone have any advice at what they may have done to stay focused and not get lead down every tangent or idea.
Assistant: I find some of my junior colleagues (atleast the ones that are very passionate about CS) asking similar questions (sometimes I find myself asking this too, even though I am now 12+ yrs into the industry). One advice I give them (and to myself too), which helped me, is - 

Focus on the job that is already assigned to you. As part of that task, make sure you dont just "get the job done", but also make sure that you understand the fundamentals behind the same. If you want to be a good programmer, you need to understand the underlying principles of "how things work". Using an API to do matrix multiplication is easy, but if you dont really know what is matrix multiplication and how to do it by hand, you are actually losing out. So in your chosen web programming domain, make sure you go beyond the surface. Understand what is really happening behind your back, when you click that button.
As part of "doing the job" you typically can figure out what is your interest area. If you are more passionate about how things are implemented, and keep figuring it out, then you are, IMO, a systems guy. If you are more passionate about finding out all the new tools and the newer features and seem to be keen in putting things together to create newer and cooler outputs, then you are an application programmer. Both are interesting areas in their own ways and as people adviced above, realize what you like and see if you can stick with it.
And I like one of the advices above. If you are still confused, try doing this "rotation" thingie. There are lots of scope in just about every domain/field and so keep rotating (but give each rotation due time), until you find what you like.

All the best.
