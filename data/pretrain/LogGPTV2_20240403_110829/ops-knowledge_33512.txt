User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to 'echo "" > x' on multiple files What is the best way how to empty a bunch of files in bash? As far I've been doing this

echo "" &gt; development.log
echo "" &gt; production.log


I don't really want to delete those files, so rm is not possible. I've tried many things like

echo "" &gt; *.log


but nothing worked.

Assistant: You don't need the echo. Just

&gt;filename


will empty the file. To edit rassie...

for FILE in *.log
do
   &gt;"${FILE}"
done


The quotes and brackets are preferred, as they will correctly handle files with spaces or special characters in them.
