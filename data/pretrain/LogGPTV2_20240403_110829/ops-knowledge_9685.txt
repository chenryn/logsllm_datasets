User: I do most of my work in Python 2.7, but I've recently encountered some tutorials that require 3.4.  Fine.  I checked and Anaconda allows installation of both under Linux (Fedora 22 to be precise).  However, now I seem to be stuck in 3.4.  I followed the Anaconda directions, entering:

conda create -n py3k python=3 anaconda
source activate py3k

I would like to be able to choose between 2.7 and 3.4 each time I run Python.  Any ideas?
Assistant: I think I can answer my own question. Python 2.7 seems to be the default.  If I activate 3.x with 

source activate py3k

I need to reboot to go back to 2.7, which, being the default, happens automatically.
If anyone knows a cleaner way, please let me know.
