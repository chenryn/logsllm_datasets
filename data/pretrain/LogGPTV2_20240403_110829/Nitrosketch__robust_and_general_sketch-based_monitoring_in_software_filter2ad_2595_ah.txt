To proceed, we need some inequalities that allow us to provide a
lower bound on the reduction in L2 of the sub-sampled stream. To
that end, we use the following results:
THEOREM 9. ([70]) Let X ∼ Bin(n, p); for all k such that np ≤
k ≤ n(1 − p):
(cid:32)
(cid:33)
,
(cid:112)np(1 − p)

where Φ(z) ≜∫ z−∞ 1√

e−z2/2 is the cumulative distribution function

e−z2/2 is the density function of the normal distri-
where ϕ(z) ≜ 1√

For convenience, we also use the following fact:

Next, we will provide a lower bound on the reduction in L2 when
sub-sampling a stream with probability p. Once again, we consider
the stream S in which m distinct elements arrived once each (and
thus its L2 is

in some cases (when the desired error probability is small), the de-
pendence between the rows in the case of uniform samples requires
asymptotically more space than our sketch, for the same error guar-
antee. Therefore, we claim that our sketch has clear advantages over
uniform sampling.
Count Sketch, for the same sampling probability p and error guaran-
tee, requires at least
