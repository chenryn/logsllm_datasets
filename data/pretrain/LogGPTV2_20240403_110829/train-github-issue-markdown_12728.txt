class Test { static name = "what"; } will report "what" for Test.name in IE11
but "Test" in FF and Chrome. This seems to be by design
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/name).
Either the use of 'name' should be not allowed at all or the compiler should
do some name mangling - although according to the specs the first option seems
to be more appropriate.
