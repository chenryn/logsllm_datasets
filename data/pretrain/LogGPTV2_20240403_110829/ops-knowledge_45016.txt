User: I have installed manually python (2.7.3). Whoc do I update the rpm version
usr/bin/python -V:
Python 2.7.3
rpm -qf /usr/bin/python:
python-2.6.5-3.el6.x86_64
any suggestions?
linux version: RH6.3
Assistant: Create a symlink in /usr/bin/ called python2.7, point to to where you have installed the new Python and use that.
Do not attempt to upgrade or force the default python on a redhat box, because a lot of other tools will stop working.
