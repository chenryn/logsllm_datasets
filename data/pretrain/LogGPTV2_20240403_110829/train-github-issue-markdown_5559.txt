I'm evaluating Superset using the docker-compose quickstart on Linux, cloned
from Git. I am unable to create new charts. However, opening an existing chart
and saving it (with or without modifications) under a new name does work.
### Expected results
Saving a new chart works.
### Actual results
The save modal closes silently, but reopening shows the message "Failed to
save slice". No new chart is created. A 500 error appears in the log, but no
stack trace is available and the PostgreSQL container's /var/log/postgres is
empty as logging does not seem to be configured.

#### How to reproduce the bug
  1. Create a new chart from the birth names sample set (I've seen the problem with both tables and big number/trendlines). In the screenshot below I adjusted the time range and group by and ran the query to validate, but those don't appear strictly necessary.
  2. Save the chart, entering a name. The modal closes but nothing else happens.
  3. Reopen the save modal to see the error message.
### Checklist
  * I have checked the superset logs for python stacktraces and included it here as text if there are any.
  * I have reproduced the issue with at least the latest released version of superset.
  * I have checked the issue tracker for the same issue and I haven't found one similar.
