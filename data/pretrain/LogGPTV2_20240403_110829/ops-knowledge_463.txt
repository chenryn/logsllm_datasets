User: I'm running Windows and the shell/OS automatically runs Python based on the registry settings when you run a program on the command line. Will this break if I install a 2.x and 3.x version of Python on the same machine?
I want to play with Python 3 while still being able to run 2.x scripts on the same machine.
Assistant: I think there is an option to setup the windows file association for .py files in the installer.  Uncheck it and you should be fine.
If not, you can easily re-associate .py files with the previous version.  The simplest way is to right click on a .py file, select "open with" / "choose program".  On the dialog that appears, select or browse to the version of python you want to use by default, and check the "always use this program to open this kind of file" checkbox.
