### Apache Airflow Version
2.0.0b2

### Environment
- **Others**: No Kubernetes (K8S)

### Issue Description
The _Logs_ and _All Instances_ buttons in the task model of the web UI are non-functional when Kubernetes is not being used.

### Expected Behavior
The _Logs_ and _All Instances_ buttons should have working links, regardless of whether Kubernetes is in use or not.

### Detailed Explanation
The `updateModalUrls()` function in `dag.html` assumes that `buttons.rendered_k8s` is set. However, this variable is not defined when Kubernetes is not being used, leading to an error. As a result, the buttons initialized after this point are not properly configured, and the following error is thrown:

```
18:28:17.990 Uncaught TypeError: elm is undefined
    at updateButtonUrl (http://.../tree?dag_id=full_pipeline:1595)
    at updateModalUrls (http://.../tree?dag_id=full_pipeline:1616)
    at call_modal (http://.../tree?dag_id=full_pipeline:1665)

    at $/ (http://158.101.169.4:8080/tree?dag_id=full_pipeline:1339)
    at tree:1595:7
```

### Suggested Fix
To resolve this issue, the call to `updateModalUrls()` should be protected by a `k8s_or_k8scelery_executor` check. This will ensure that the function only runs when the appropriate conditions are met, preventing the `TypeError` and ensuring the buttons are functional.
