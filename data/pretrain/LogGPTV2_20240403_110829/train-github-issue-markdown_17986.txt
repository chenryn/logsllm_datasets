 **Apache Airflow version** : 2.0.0b2
**Environment** :
  * **Others** : No K8S
**What happened** :
In the The _Logs_ and _All Instances_ buttons in the task model in the web UI
are inoperative when _not_ using Kubernetes.
**What you expected to happen** :
The buttons to have working links.
The `dag.html` `updateModalUrls()` function assumes that
`buttons.rendered_k8s` is set, which is not the case when not using K8S.
This then results in an error and the buttons initialised after this point are
not wired up:
    18:28:17.990 Uncaught TypeError: elm is undefined

The call needs to be protected by a `k8s_or_k8scelery_executor` check.
