User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it possible to use Chrome as a transport? I am in need to send some json log files to an AWS server.

But the proxy, ISP or something else I cannot get in touch with is blocking everything else besides browsers on 80 and 443. Even Curl and wget are failing.

Is there a way to pipe my data thru Chrome? I mean run my application and have it use Chrome to send the HTTP requests?

Thanks

Assistant: Just convince the site your are using a browser, e.g. with 

wget --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/37.0.2049.0 Safari/537.36"


(User agent string from here)
