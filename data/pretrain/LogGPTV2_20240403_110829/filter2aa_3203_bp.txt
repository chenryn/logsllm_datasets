NetBIOS name resolution using broadcasts can only resolve names of NetBIOS processes running on 
nodes attached to the local subnet. 
You can enable NetBT broadcast forwarding (UDP ports 137 and 138) on some routers. However, the 
practice of enabling NetBT broadcast forwarding to simplify NetBIOS name resolution is highly 
discouraged. 
Resolving Names with a NetBIOS Name Server 
To resolve the NetBIOS names of NetBIOS applications running on local or remote computers, NetBT 
nodes commonly use an NBNS. When using an NBNS, the name resolution process is the following: 
1. NetBT checks the NetBIOS name cache for the NetBIOS name-to-IPv4 address mapping. 
2. If the name cannot be resolved using the NetBIOS name cache, NetBT sends a unicast NetBIOS 
Name Query Request message containing the NetBIOS name of the destination application to the 
NBNS.  
3. If the NBNS can resolve the NetBIOS name to an IPv4 address, the NBNS returns the IPv4 address 
to the sending host with a positive NetBIOS Name Query Response message. If the NBNS cannot 
resolve the NetBIOS name to an IPv4 address, the NBNS sends a negative NetBIOS Name Query 
Response message. 
By default, a computer running Windows attempts to locate its primary NBNS server (a WINS server) 
three times. If the computer receives no response or a negative NetBIOS Name Query Response 
message indicating that the name was not found, the computer running Windows attempts to contact 
additional WINS servers. 
When the sending host receives the positive NetBIOS Name Query Response message, the host can 
begin to communicate with the destination NetBIOS application using a NetBIOS datagram or a 
NetBIOS session. 
Windows Methods of Resolving NetBIOS Names 
Computers running Windows can also attempt to resolve NetBIOS names using the Lmhosts file, the 
local host name, the DNS client resolver cache, and DNS servers. NetBT in Windows uses the 
following process: 
Chapter 11 – NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 328 
1. When a NetBIOS application needs to resolve a NetBIOS name to an IPv4 address, NetBT checks 
the NetBIOS name cache for the NetBIOS name-to-IPv4 address mapping of the destination host. If 
NetBT finds a mapping, the NetBIOS name is resolved without generating network activity.  
2. If the name is not resolved from the entries in the NetBIOS name cache, NetBT attempts to resolve 
the name through three NetBIOS name queries to each configured NBNS. 
3. If the configured NBNSs do not send a positive name response, NetBT sends up to three broadcast 
queries on the local network. 
4. If there is no positive name response and the Use LMHOSTS lookup check box on the WINS tab is 
selected, NetBT scans the local Lmhosts file. For more information, see "Using the Lmhosts File" in 
this chapter. 
5. If the NetBIOS name is not resolved from the Lmhosts file, Windows attempts to resolve the name 
through host name resolution techniques. NetBT converts the NetBIOS name to a single-label, 
unqualified domain name by taking the first 15 bytes of the NetBIOS name and removing spaces 
from the end of the name. For example, for the NetBIOS name FILESRV1       [20], the 
corresponding single-label, unqualified domain name is filesrv1. The first step in host name resolution 
techniques is to check for a match against the local host name. 
6. If the converted NetBIOS name does not match the local host name, the DNS Client service checks 
the DNS client resolver cache. 
7. If the name is not found in the DNS client resolver cache, the DNS Client service attempts to resolve 
the name by sending queries to a DNS server. The DNS Client service creates fully qualified names 
from the converted NetBIOS name—a single-label, unqualified domain name—using the techniques 
described in Chapter 9, “Windows Support for DNS.” 
8. If the name is not resolved through DNS, computers running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 
use the Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol and send up to two sets of multicast 
LLMNR query messages. For more information about LLMNR, see Chapter 8, “Host Name 
Resolution.” 
If none of these methods resolve the NetBIOS name, NetBT indicates an error to the requesting 
NetBIOS application, which typically displays an error message to the user.

NetBIOS Node Types 
Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 support all of the 
NetBIOS node types defined in RFCs 1001 and 1002. Each node type resolves NetBIOS names 
differently. Table 11-4 lists and describes the NetBIOS node types. 
Node type 
Description 
B-node (broadcast) 
Uses broadcasts for name registration and resolution.  
Because routers typically do not forward NetBT 
broadcasts, NetBIOS resources that are located on 
remote subnets cannot be resolved. 
P-node (peer-peer) 
Uses an NBNS such as WINS to resolve NetBIOS 
names. P-node does not use broadcasts but queries 
the NBNS directly. Because broadcasts are not used, 
NetBIOS resources located on remote subnets can be 
resolved. However, if the NBNS becomes unavailable, 
NetBIOS name resolution fails for all NetBIOS names, 
even for NetBIOS applications that are located on the 
local subnet. 
M-node (mixed) 
A combination of B-node and P-node. By default, an 
M-node functions as a B-node. If the broadcast name 
query is unsuccessful, NetBT uses an NBNS. 
H-node (hybrid) 
A combination of P-node and B-node. By default, an 
H-node functions as a P-node. If the unicast name 
query to the NBNS is unsuccessful, NetBT uses a 
broadcast. 
Microsoft enhanced B-node 
A combination of B-node and the use of the local 
Lmhosts file. If the broadcast name query is not 
successful, NetBT checks the local Lmhosts file. 
Table 11-4  NetBIOS node types 
By default, NetBT on computers running Windows use the Microsoft enhanced B-node NetBIOS node 
type if no WINS servers are configured. If at least one WINS server is configured, NetBT uses H-node. 
You can override this default behavior and explicitly configure the NetBIOS node type in the following 
ways: 
By using the DHCP WINS/NBT Node Type option (option 46) and setting the value to 1 (Microsoft-
enhanced B-node), 2 (P-node), 4 (M-node), or 8 (H-node). 
By setting the 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\Parameters\NodeType registry 
value to 1 (Microsoft-enhanced B-node), 2 (P-node), 4 (M-node), or 8 (H-node).

Using the Lmhosts File 
The Lmhosts file is a static text file of NetBIOS names and IPv4 addresses. NetBT uses an Lmhosts file 
to resolve the NetBIOS names for NetBIOS applications that are running on remote computers on a 
network that does not contain NBNSs. The Lmhosts file has the following characteristics: 
Entries consist of an IPv4 address and a NetBIOS computer name. For example: 
131.107.7.29 
emailsrv1 
Entries are not case-sensitive. 
Each computer has its own file in the systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc folder. 
This folder includes a sample Lmhosts file (Lmhosts.sam). You can create another file named 
Lmhosts or you can rename or copy Lmhosts.sam to Lmhosts in this folder. 
By default, computers running Windows use the Lmhosts file, if it exists, in NetBIOS name resolution. 
You can disable the use of the Lmhosts file by clearing the Use LMHOSTS Lookup check box on the 
WINS tab of the Advanced TCP/IP Properties dialog box, as Figure 11-2 shows.  
Predefined Keywords 
The Lmhosts file can contain predefined keywords that are prefixed with the “#” character. Table 11-5 
lists the possible Lmhosts keywords. 
Chapter 11 – NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 331 
Keyword 
Description 
#PRE 
Defines which entries should be initially preloaded as 
permanent entries in the NetBIOS name cache. 
Preloaded entries reduce network broadcasts, 
because names are resolved from the cache rather 
than from broadcast queries. Entries with a #PRE tag 
are loaded automatically when TCP/IP is started or 
manually with the nbtstat –R command. 
#DOM:DomainName 
Identifies computers for Windows domain activities 
such as logon validation, account synchronization, and 
computer browsing. 
#NOFNR 
Avoids using NetBIOS unicast name queries for older 
computers running LAN Manager for UNIX. 
#INCLUDE  Path\FileName 
Loads and searches entries in the Path\FileName file, 
a centrally located and shared Lmhosts file. The 
recommended way to specify file paths is using a 
universal naming convention (UNC) path such as 
\\fileserv1\public. You must have entries for the 
computer names of remote servers hosting the shares 
in the local Lmhosts file; otherwise, the shares will not 
be accessible. 
#BEGIN_ALTERNATE 
#END_ALTERNATE 
Defines a list of alternate locations for Lmhosts files.  
#MH 
Adds multiple entries for a multihomed computer. 
Table 11-5  Lmhosts keywords 
Because the Lmhosts file is read sequentially, you should add the most frequently accessed computers 
as the first entries of the file, and add the #PRE-tagged entries as the last entries of the file. Because 
the #PRE entries are loaded into the NetBIOS name cache, they are not needed when NetBT scans the 
Lmhosts file after startup. Placing them as the last entries of the file allows NetBT to scan the Lmhosts 
file for other NetBIOS names more quickly. 
Using a Centralized Lmhosts File 
NetBT can also scan Lmhosts files that are located on other computers, which allows you to maintain a 
centralized Lmhosts file that can be accessed through a user’s local Lmhosts file. Using a centralized 
Lmhosts file still requires each computer to have a local Lmhosts file. 
To access a centralized Lmhosts file, a computer’s local Lmhosts file must have an entry with the 
#INCLUDE tag and the location of the centralized file. For example: 
#INCLUDE 
\\Bootsrv3\Public\Lmhosts 
In this example, NetBT includes the Lmhosts file on the Public shared folder of the server named 
Bootsrv3 in its attempts to resolve a remote NetBIOS name to an IPv4 address. 
NetBT scans the centralized Lmhosts file before a user logs on to the computer. Because no user name 
is associated with the computer before a user logs on, NetBT uses a null user name for its credentials 
when accessing the shared folder where the central Lmhosts file is located.  
Chapter 11 – NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 332 
To allow null access to a shared folder that contains an Lmhosts file, you must type the name of the 
folder as the string value of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet 
\Services\Lanmanserver \Parameters\NullSessionShares registry value on the Windows-based server 
that is hosting the shared folder, and then restart the Server service. If you do not set this registry value, 
the remote Lmhosts file is not accessible until after a valid user logs on to the computer. 
The #BEGIN_ALTERNATE and #END_ALTERNATE tags allow you to include a block of remote 
Lmhosts file locations in the search for a NetBIOS name-to-IPv4 address mapping. This technique is 
known as block inclusion. For example: 
#BEGIN_ALTERNATE 
#INCLUDE 
\\Bootsrv3\Public\Lmhosts 
#INCLUDE 
\\Bootsrv4\Public\Lmhosts 
#INCLUDE 
\\Bootsrv9\Public\Lmhosts 
#END_ALTERNATE 
When NetBT uses a block inclusion, it scans only the first accessible Lmhosts file in the block. NetBT 
does not access additional Lmhosts files, even if the first accessible Lmhosts file does not contain the 
desired name. Block inclusion provides fault tolerance for centralized Lmhosts files. 
Creating Lmhosts Entries for Specific NetBIOS Names 
A typical entry in the Lmhosts file for a NetBIOS computer name allows the resolution of the three 
NetBIOS names: 
ComputerName[00] 
ComputerName[03] 
ComputerName[20] 
These names correspond to the Workstation, Server, and Messenger services, respectively. 
However, you might need to resolve a specific 16-character NetBIOS name to a NetBIOS application 
running on a remote computer. You can configure any arbitrary 16-byte NetBIOS name in the Lmhosts 
file by using the following syntax: 
IPv4Address  "NameSpacePadding\0xN" 
In which: 
IPv4Address is the IPv4 address to which this NetBIOS name is resolved. 
Name is the first part of the NetBIOS name (up to 15 bytes) 
SpacePadding is needed to ensure that the full NetBIOS name is 16 bytes. If the Name portion has 
fewer than 15 bytes, it must be padded with spaces up to 15 bytes. 
N indicates the two-digit hexadecimal representation of the 16th byte of the NetBIOS name. The syntax 
\0xN can represent any byte in the NetBIOS name but is most often used for the 16th character. 
For example, you might create an entry so that a computer browsing client can resolve the NetBIOS 
name Domain0x1B. Domain0x1B is a NetBIOS name that is registered by Domain Master Browse 
Servers, and certain types of computer browsing situations require the successful resolution of the 
Chapter 11 – NetBIOS over TCP/IP 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 333 
Domain0x1B NetBIOS name. For example, the Lmhosts file entry for the NetBIOS domain name of 
EXAMPLE and IPv4 address of 131.107.4.31 is: 
131.107.4.31     "EXAMPLE        \0x1B" 
For more information about the Lmhosts file and computer browsing, see Appendix C, “Computer 
Browser Service.” 
Name Resolution Problems Using Lmhosts 
The most common problems with NetBIOS name resolution when using the Lmhosts file are the 
following: 
An entry for a remote NetBIOS name does not exist in the Lmhosts file. 
Verify that the IPv4 address-to-NetBIOS name mappings of all remote hosts that a computer needs 
to access are added to the Lmhosts file. 
The NetBIOS name in the Lmhosts file is misspelled. 
Verify the spelling of all names as you add them. 
The IPv4 address is invalid for the NetBIOS name. 
Verify that the IPv4 address is correct for the corresponding NetBIOS name. 
The Lmhosts file contains multiple entries for the same NetBIOS name. 
Verify that each entry in the Lmhosts file is unique. If the file contains duplicate names, NetBT uses 
the first name listed in the file. NetBT will not read the Lmhosts file for any additional entries. 
To test an entry in the Lmhosts file, use a NetBIOS application (such as the nbtstat -a command) to 
verify whether the entry was added correctly.

The Nbtstat Tool 
The Nbtstat tool is your primary tool for collecting NetBT information when troubleshooting NetBIOS 
name issues. Table 11-6 lists the most commonly used Nbtstat options. 
Option 
Description 
-n 
Displays the NetBIOS name table of the local computer. You use 
this option to determine the NetBIOS applications that are running 
on the local computer and their corresponding unique and group 
NetBIOS names. 
-a RemoteComputerName 
-A IPv4Address 
Displays the NetBIOS name table of a remote computer by its name 
or IPv4 address. You use this option to determine the NetBIOS 
applications that are running on a remote computer and their 
corresponding unique and group NetBIOS names. 
-c 
Displays the NetBIOS name cache of the local computer. 
-R 
Manually flushes and reloads the NetBIOS name cache with the 
entries in the Lmhosts file that use the #PRE parameter. 
-RR 
Releases and reregisters all local NetBIOS names with the NBNS 
(a WINS server). You use this option when troubleshooting WINS 
registration issues.
