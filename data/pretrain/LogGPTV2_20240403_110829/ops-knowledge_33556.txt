Assistant: This system log chunk shows that the CBS software component is expecting an attribute name and failing to get the next element. It is also warning about an unrecognized packageExtended attribute. This is happening multiple times with the same HRESULT code of 0x800f080d - CBS_E_MANIFEST_INVALID_ITEM.
