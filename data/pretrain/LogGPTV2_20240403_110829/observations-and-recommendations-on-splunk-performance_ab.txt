# Search Pipeline Overview

## High-Level Search Pipeline
The search pipeline in Splunk involves several key steps, which are repeated until the search completes. These steps include:

1. **Find Buckets**: Identify relevant data buckets based on the search timerange.
2. **Check tsidx for Events**: Verify if the events match the LISPY (LISP-like) query.
3. **Read journal.gz**: Access and read the `journal.gz` file at specific offsets.
4. **Process Events**: Perform operations such as st rename, extract, report, kv, alias, eval, lookup, and subsecond processing.
5. **Filter Events**: Match events to the search string, including event typing and tagging.
6. **Write Temporary Results**: Store intermediate results in a temporary directory.
7. **Return Progress**: Send progress updates to the Splunk search head (`SH splunkd`).

## Search Pipeline Boundedness
- **Preparatory Steps**: Some initial steps are performed before the main search process begins.
- **Repetition**: The above steps are repeated until the search is complete.

## Search Types
### Dense Searches
- **Characteristics**: Predominantly return many events per bucket.
- **Example Query**: `index=web | stats count by clientip`

### Sparse Searches
- **Characteristics**: Predominantly return some events per bucket.
- **Example Query**: `index=web some_term | stats count by clientip`

### Rare Searches
- **Characteristics**: Predominantly return only a few events per index.
- **Example Query**: `index=web url=onedomain* | stats count by clientip`

## Testing Searches
- **Data Characteristics**: The indexed data contains many unique terms with predictable term density.
- **Term Densities**: 1/100, 1/1M, 1/100M
- **Search Concurrency**: 4 to 60 concurrent searches
- **Searches**:
  - **Rare**: Over the entire 1TB dataset.
  - **Dense**: Over a preselected time range.
- **Indexing Workload**: Repeat the tests while under an indexing workload.

## Dense Searches Performance
- **CPU Utilization**: Hitting 100% CPU utilization.
- **IO Wait**: Significant IO wait times.
- **Summary**:
  - **CPU Bound**: Dense workloads are primarily CPU-bound.
  - **Impact**: Both dense workload completion times and indexing throughput are negatively affected when running simultaneously.
  - **Improvement**: Faster and more CPUs would improve overall performance, as the majority of time is spent in CPU decompression and SPL processing.

## Rare Searches Performance
- **CPU Utilization**: Lower CPU utilization compared to dense searches.
- **IO Wait**: Higher IO wait times.
- **Summary**:
  - **IO Bound**: Rare workloads are primarily IO-bound.
  - **Impact**: Both rare workload completion times and indexing throughput are negatively affected when running simultaneously.
  - **Bloomfilters**: Help improve search performance by indicating with 100% certainty that a term does not exist in a bucket.
  - **Improvement**: Faster disks would help, but more CPUs would not significantly improve performance.

## Determining CPU or IO Bound
- **Guideline**:
  - `command.search.rawdata`: CPU Bound (e.g., .kv, .typer, .calcfields)
  - `command.search.index`: IO Bound

## Metric Store Performance
- **Types & Tests**:
  - **Query Response Times**: Metrics vs. Events
  - **Ingestion**:
    - **HTTP Endpoint (HEC)**: ~55,000 EPS per indexer without search load, scales nearly linearly.
    - **UDP**: Varies, with 33% packet loss at 10,000 EPS.

## Top Takeaways
- **Indexing**:
  - **Distribute**: Splunk scales horizontally.
  - **Tuning**: Optimize event breaking and timestamp extraction.
  - **Hardware**: Faster CPUs will help with indexing performance.
- **Searching**:
  - **Distribute**: Splunk scales horizontally.
  - **Dense Workloads**: CPU Bound, better with indexing than rare.
  - **Rare Workloads**: IO Bound, not as good with indexing.
  - **Bloomfilters**: Significantly help.
  - **Faster Disks**: SSDs will help.
  - **Performance**: Avoid generality, optimize for expected cases, and add hardware as needed.

## Testing Disclaimer
- **Datasets**: Arbitrary datasets used.
- **Environment**: "Closed course" (lab) environment.
- **Context**: Results should not be interpreted out of context.
