**ATT&CK ID:** T1110.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Password Guessing

Adversaries who lack prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within a system or environment may resort to password guessing in an attempt to gain access to accounts. When the actual password for an account is unknown, adversaries might systematically guess the password using automated or iterative methods. During an operation, adversaries often use lists of common passwords to try and guess login credentials. This technique may or may not consider the target's password complexity requirements or account lockout policies, which can trigger after a specified number of failed login attempts.
