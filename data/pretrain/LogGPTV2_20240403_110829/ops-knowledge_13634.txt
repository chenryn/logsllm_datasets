It sounds like you're encountering issues with running Google App Engine on your Mac (OS 10.9.3) after installing Python 3.4. Here's a more structured and professional approach to help resolve the problem:

### Issue Summary
- **Initial Problem**: After installing Python 3.4, the command for running Google App Engine from the terminal via `/usr/local/dev_appengine` stopped working.
- **Further Complications**: Attempts to follow online help forums led to additional issues, including the Google App Engine Launcher not functioning properly and the inability to run `python2.5`.
- **Current Symptoms**:
  - The Google App Engine Launcher displays an error: "Sorry, pieces of GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app appear missing or corrupted, or I can't run python2.5 properly."
  - Reinstalling the application and related files did not resolve the issue.
  - Running `dev_appserver.py` from the terminal results in the error: "/usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py: No such file or directory."

### Solution Steps

1. **Check Python Version**:
   - Google App Engine does not support Python 3.x. Ensure that you have Python 2.x installed.
   - Open a terminal and type the following commands to check if Python 2.x is installed and find its path:
     ```sh
     whereis python
     whereis python2.7
     ```

2. **Update Google App Engine Launcher Preferences**:
   - Open the Google App Engine Launcher.
   - Go to `Preferences` and ensure that the `Python Path` is set to the correct Python 2.x version. For example, it should be something like:
     ```sh
     /usr/bin/python2.7
     ```

3. **Reinstall Google App Engine SDK**:
   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reinstalling the Google App Engine SDK.
   - Download the latest version of the Google App Engine SDK for Python 2.x from the official [Google Cloud SDK website](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/download).
   - Follow the installation instructions provided.

4. **Verify Symlinks**:
   - Ensure that the necessary symlinks are created during the installation process. If they are missing, you can manually create them. For example:
     ```sh
     sudo ln -s /path/to/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py /usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py
     sudo ln -s /path/to/google_appengine/appcfg.py /usr/local/bin/appcfg.py
     ```

5. **Test the Installation**:
   - After making the necessary changes, try running the Google App Engine Launcher again.
   - From the terminal, test the `dev_appserver.py` command:
     ```sh
     dev_appserver.py /path/to/your/app
     ```

### Additional Tips
- **Backup Your Data**: Before making any significant changes, ensure you have a backup of your project and important data.
- **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the official [Google App Engine documentation](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/) for detailed setup and troubleshooting steps.
