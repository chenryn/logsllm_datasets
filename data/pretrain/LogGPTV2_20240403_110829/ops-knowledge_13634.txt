User: I installed Python 3.4 on my Mac (OS 10.9.3) and my command for running Google App Engine from the terminal via /usr/local/dev_appengine stopped working. I then (stupidly) did some rather arbitrary things from online help forums and now my Google App Engine itself stopped working as well. When I open it, it says:
Sorry, pieces of GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app appear missing or corrupted, or I can't run python2.5 properly.  Output was:
I have tried to delete the application and all related files and reinstall, but nothing has worked for me. It now fails to make the command symlinks as well so when I try to run from terminal I get /usr/local/bin/dev_appserver.py: No such file or directory.
Assistant: App Engine does not support Python 3.x.  Do you still have 2.x installed?  Go to your Google App Engine Launcher > Preferences, and make sure you have the proper Python Path to your v2.x.  It should be something like "/usr/bin/python2.7"
From Terminal, typewhereis python to help find it.  If you know you were using version 2.7, try: whereis python2.7
