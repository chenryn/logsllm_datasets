computation is done with the well-known forward-backward
algorithm for hidden Markov models [20]. The probability of
a genome sequence M, which is the coupling of two haploid
genotypes, can be computed similarly by extending this hidden
Markov model so that state j will take a value pair (X 1
j ),
where X 1
j denotes the ﬁrst original haploid genotype and
X 2
j denotes the second. Such an extension technique has
been detailed in a genotype imputation scenario [21]. The
conditional probability P (mi+1|M1,i) can then be computed
in the intermediate steps of the forward algorithm. Model and
algorithm details are given in Appendix A.

The correlation between two SNVs, which is considered in
the previous two models, is essentially the result of recombi-

Fig. 5: An example showing how the haploid genotype h4 is
interpreted as an imperfect mosaic of a given set of haploid
genotypes {h1, h2, h3}, based on recombination and mutation.
Each haploid genotype can be as long as the whole genome,
but we show only four loci here to explain the idea. White
circle means allele 0 for that locus, whereas black circle means
allele 1. The ﬁrst allele of haploid genotype h4 is copied
from h1. Though the second allele comes from h3, it mutates
to a different allele. The third allele is copied from h2, and
the fourth is copied from h1. Note that this shows just one
possible process to get h4 from {h1, h2, h3}, and as there are
many other possibilities, the task of this model is to compute
the probability of observing h4 by taking all the possible
underlying processes into account, which constitutes a hidden
Markov model.
we are able to capture the high-order correlation efﬁciently,
without having to estimate a large number of parameters.
4) Goodness of ﬁt of the models: To evaluate the models,
we used different types of real genomic datasets from HapMap,
for the population CEU (Utah residents with Northern and
Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection) [22],
including:
•
•
•
A diploid genotype dataset that contains 165 individ-
uals, each having 22 pairs of autosomes (different
from sex chromosomes that are discussed in Sec-
tion VI-A). The shortest chromosome contains 17304
SNVs, whereas the longest one contains 102157
SNVs;
A haploid genotype dataset that contains 234 haploid
genotypes, each of which has the same sequence of
loci as that in the diploid genotype dataset on the 22
chromosomes;
Allele frequency and linkage disequilibrium datasets
for each chromosome;
Recombination rates for each chromosome.
•
We performed a chi-square goodness-of-ﬁt test to show
how well each model ﬁts the diploid genotype dataset. We
divided the sequence space M into B bins with equal proba-
bility. The chi-square statistic is deﬁned as

Fig. 6: Chi-square goodness-of-ﬁt tests for different genome
sequence models on 22 chromosomes. The x-axis is the
chromosome number, from 1 to 22. To graphically show the
results at a ﬁne scale, the left y-axis is transformed to the
logarithm of chi-squared statistic. The right y-axis shows one
frequently used signiﬁcance level, α = 0.01, and another
signiﬁcance level, α = 0.2. The uniform distribution model
is the one used in conventional encryption. The “public LD
model” is built with public LD and AF data. The “0-th”, “1-
st”, “2-nd”-order models are the Markov models built on the
dataset. Finally, the “recombination model” is built based on
genetic recombination and mutation. Most models are rejected
at α = 0.01, whereas the recombination model cannot be
rejected even at α = 0.2, which shows a good ﬁt of this model
on real datasets.
data follows the speciﬁed distribution model. B is chosen with
an empirical formula in statistical theory [23] (B = (cid:15)1.88N 2
5(cid:16)
where N is the sample size). We performed several rounds of
the test for different B values around the empirical one and
they all gave similar results. Hence we set B to be 10, and
show the results in Figure 6. From the chi-square statistics, we
can see that uniform distribution indeed gives a poor model of
genome sequences. The 0-th-order model built on the dataset
is also not appropriate because it does not take the correlation
among SNVs into account. The model built with public LD
and AF performs similarly with the ﬁrst-order model built on
the dataset, which is reasonable because they both consider
only the ﬁrst-order correlation. The second-order model is
better than the previous four models, but
is not stable
across different chromosomes: in many chromosomes, we can
reject the null hypothesis H0 at the signiﬁcance level (α) of
0.01. The recombination model performs best among these
models because it captures high-order correlations that are
naturally caused by the underlying recombination mechanism.
Moreover,

be rejected, even at the signiﬁcance level of 0.2 in every
chromosome, which shows a good ﬁt of this model on real
datasets. Therefore, we keep this model for our scheme.

Once the algorithm allocates seed space of size 3n−i−1 to
a branch at step i (as in Section IV-C), each following step
simply segments an input interval into three parts of equal size.
Hence there is only one seed for each sequence in the sub-tree
under the branch of step i. As discussed in Section IV-C, in
such a case, the subinterval of the jth node at depth i of the
tree will contain 3n−i−1 integers that are exactly the number
of sequences under that branch.
The goal in constructing a DTE is that decode applied to
uniform points (in the seed space) provides sampling close
to that of the target distribution pm;
this is the sequence
distribution produced by the kth-order Markov chain. The seed
space S is the integer interval [0, 2hn − 1] (i.e., l = hn). We
deﬁne pd to be the DTE message distribution over M by
= M : S ← $ S; M(cid:2) ← decode(S)].
pd(M) = P [M(cid:2)
The additional security provided by honey encryption depends
on the difference between pm and pd. Intuitively, pm and pd are
“close” in a secure DTE. Next, we quantify this difference for
the proposed DTE scheme. Let P i
m be the original probability
pm(M(cid:2)
of the preﬁx sequence M1,i, namely, P i
).

Lemma 1 bounds the largest difference between pm(M)
and pd(M). It gives rise to the following important theorem
that bounds the DTE advantage of an adversary, introduced by
honey encryption. The DTE advantage is formally deﬁned by
the following deﬁnition.

between the two games shown in Figure 7. The advantage
of A for the sequence distribution pm and encoding scheme

Fig. 8: Game deﬁning MR security. Given ciphertext C∗
(encrypted from M∗), adversary B is allowed to guess the
message by brute-force attack. B wins the game if his output
message M is the same as the original message M∗.
Proof Sketch: The proof follows Theorem 6 in [13]. (cid:2)
The last step of the security analysis is the quantiﬁcation
of message recovery (MR) security for any adversary B against
the encryption scheme HE.
Deﬁnition 2. Let B be the adversary attempting to recover the
correct sequence given the honey encryption of the sequence,
as shown in Figure 8. The advantage of B against HE is

We emphasize that pk, the password distribution, is non-
uniform. We assume the most probable password has a prob-
ability w. Using Lemma 1 and Theorem 1, we can establish
the following theorem.
Theorem 2. Consider HE[DTE, H] (the detailed deﬁnition is
available in [13]) with H (the hash function) modeled as
a random oracle and DTE using an hn-bit representation.
Let pm be the sequence distribution with maximum sequence
probability γ, and pk be a key distribution with maximum
weight w. Let α = (cid:13)1/w(cid:14). Then for any adversary B,

Proof: The proof is similar to Corollary 1 in [13]. We omit
the redundant details and specify the necessary modiﬁcations
in the following.
γ ≤ 3 − √
pm is a non-uniform sequence distribution and we assume
5 ≈ 0.76, which is a requirement for Corollary 1
(in [13]). This assumption is reasonable considering the length
of the sequence n (≥ 20000)5. To estimate γ, we can consider
the sequence with all major alleles and pessimistically assume
each major allele frequency is 0.995, large enough to give an
upper bound for real datasets. Then, γ can be estimated by
