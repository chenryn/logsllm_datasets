the USB driver stack to drop/allow USB packets based on a set
of rules. Similarly, Cinch [4] creates a virtual machine layer
between USB devices and the host machine to act as a ﬁrewall.
Johnson et al. [32] designed a packet parser to protect the
system from malformed USB packets. Tian et al. [57] proposed
a uniﬁed framework to protect against malicious peripherals.
Other prior works like USBeSafe [33] and USBlock [40] utilize
machine learning algorithms to analyze the characteristics of
USB packet trafﬁc to prevent keyboard mimicry attacks [30].
Like those works, Time-Print is a software-based approach to
enhancing USB security.
IX. CONCLUSION
This paper presents Time-Print, a novel timing-based ﬁn-
gerprinting mechanism for identifying USB mass storage
devices. Time-Print creates device ﬁngerprints by leveraging
the distinctive timing differences of read operations on different
devices. We develop the prototype of Time-Print as a completely
software-based solution, which requires no extra hardware
and thus is compatible with all current USB mass storage
devices. To assess the potential security beneﬁts of Time-
Print, we present a comprehensive evaluation of over 40 USB
drives in three different security scenarios, demonstrating Time-
Print’s ability to (1) identify known/unknown device models
with greater than 99.5% accuracy, (2) identify seen/unseen
devices within the same model with 95% accuracy, and (3)
individually classify devices within the same model with
98.7% accuracy. We further examine the practicality of Time-
Print, showing that Time-Print can retain high accuracy under
different circumstances while incurring low system latency.
