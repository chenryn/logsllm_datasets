Many hotspot clients have sessions shorter than an hour: the me-
dian hotspot session length is 30 minutes, while 30% of hotspot
sessions longer than two hours. Smartphone clients have the short-
est session lengths: over half the sessions are less than 10 minutes,
and only 10% are longer than an hour.
Just because clients are associated with the network does not nec-
essarily mean that they are active during the entire session. Figure 9
shows what fraction of their sessions the clients were actually ac-
tive. Not only do smartphone users have short sessions, their ses-
sion activity is quite low. For over half of smartphone sessions,
clients are active for less than 10% of the time. This low activity
suggests that users have their phones and WiFi turned on when in
the network, but use Internet applications only infrequently. Mo-
dem clients are much more active during their sessions. Over 40%
of their sessions are active at least half the time. Finally, hotspot
clients are the most active when connected to the network; the me-
dian session is active almost 75% of the time. This activity suggests
that hotspot users connect to the network with the intention to use
it, and disconnect when ﬁnished.
4.2.2 Application classes
It is natural to ask what types of trafﬁc the Google WiFi network
carries. Using a ﬁve-day packet header trace spanning a weekend
during our larger trace, we classify the ﬁrst packet of each ﬂow
based on protocol and port numbers. Figure 10(a) plots the number
of connections for each trafﬁc class as a function of the time of day.
While our port-based trafﬁc classiﬁcation mechanism is imperfect,
it is clear that peer-to-peer connections constitute a signiﬁcant frac-
tion of the network use. (While most of the trafﬁc is BitTorrent, we
see a remarkable amount of “Thunder” trafﬁc, a Chinese peer-to-
peer protocol also known as Xunlei, which operates on UDP port
15000.) Interestingly, peer-to-peer usage appears to be relatively
time insensitive, which is consistent with users that leave their ﬁle
sharing clients on almost all the time.
Web trafﬁc is signiﬁcantly more diurnal, seeing a signiﬁcant dip
in the early morning hours, and peaking in the evenings. Perhaps
the most unusual feature is the dramatic variation in the frequency
of management (ICMP, DHCP, and DNS) connections. The vast
majority of this trafﬁc is actually mDNS “dnsbugtest” trafﬁc, how-
ever. In fact, Figure 11(a) shows that almost all of it stems from a
few particular modem devices.
The other two main connection contributors, other TCP and non-
TCP show less signiﬁcant—but still apparent—diurnal trends. We
group SSH, telnet, X windows, and similar remote log-in protocols
into an interactive class; perhaps not surprisingly they represent
a consistently negligible fraction of the total connections. Finally,
we observe very few VPN connections, despite the fact that Google
promotes Google Secure Access, a free VPN provided by Google
for use on the Google WiFi network—although the VPN connec-
tions that do exist turn out to be relatively heavy.
The picture for bytes is similar. Figure 10(b) plots the total
amount of data transferred in the network as a function of hour

of the day. HTTP and other TCP trafﬁc clearly represent the lion’s
share of the trafﬁc. We suspect that other TCP is largely peer-to-
peer trafﬁc that we failed to properly classify. Identiﬁed peer-to-
peer trafﬁc forms the next tier of usage, along with non-TCP traf-
ﬁc which we suspect represents VoIP and other multimedia trans-
fers. The log-scale y-axis provides a better view on the interactive
and VPN trafﬁc, which shows a subtle diurnal trend. Finally, we
see that management ﬂows, while frequent, constitute a very small
fraction of the total trafﬁc in terms of total bytes transferred.
Figure 11 breaks down each of the two preceding graphs by
client type. To do so, we build a mapping between the client MAC
addresses and assigned IP addresses in the RADIUS logs, and then
classify the trafﬁc logs by IP address. Not surprisingly, the three
device types show markedly different application usage. Smart-
phones, in particular, generate very few connections, and almost
all their bytes are Web or other TCP applications. We surmise that
the bulk of the other trafﬁc is made up by streaming media (e.g.,
UPnP-based iPhone video players like Mooncat) and VoIP trafﬁc,
but further analysis is required.5
The distinctions between modem and hotspot users are far more
subtle. It is worth noting, however, that there are an order of mag-
nitude more hotspot users than modem users, yet the modem users
place similar aggregate trafﬁc usage demands on the network. Both
modem and hotspot users show a signiﬁcant amount of peer-to-
peer, Web, and non-TCP trafﬁc. Of note, the modem P2P users
appear to receive much higher per-connection bandwidth than the
Hotspot users, which is consistent with our observations about the
instantaneous bandwidth achieved by each client type (c.f., Fig-
ure 7). Hotspot users are signiﬁcantly more likely to use interactive
remote login applications than modem users, but we have not at-
tempted to determine why that may be.
Finally, we observe that almost all the connection volume in the
management class stems from modem clients—Ruckus devices in
particular. While many devices in our trace periodically issue “dns-
bugtest” mDNS requests, some Ruckus devices issue thousands of
queries during each 15-minute interval. The precise cause of this
behavior deserves further investigation.
5Assuming iPhones are extremely unlikely to be using BitTorrent
clients (although at least one exists), we use signiﬁcant BT activity
(more than 1 MB) as a ﬁlter to pull three presumably misclassiﬁed
Apple laptops out of the Smartphone grouping.

5. MOBILITY
We now turn to questions of client mobility; in particular, we
study how frequently, fast, and far hosts move. Because clients do
not report their geographical location, we use the location of the AP
to which they associate as a proxy for their current location. The
Google WiFi network has varying density, but APs are approxi-
mately 100 meters apart on average. While that estimate provides
an effective upper bound on the resolution of our location data, it is
possible that clients may associate to APs other than the physically
closest one due to variations in signal propagation.
5.1 Oscillations
Moreover, signal strength is a time-varying process, even for
ﬁxed clients. To gain an appreciation for the degree of ﬂuctuation
in the network, we consider the number of oscillations in AP asso-
ciations. To do so, we record the last three distinct APs to which
a client has associated within the last hour. If a new association
is to one of the previous three most recent APs, we consider it an
oscillation. (While it is possible that our deﬁnition captures some
instances of physical movement, only ﬁve oscillation occurrences
include APs physically separated by distances of 1500 meters or
more, so we believe it to be a reasonably accurate approximation.)

Number of distinct APs
Figure 13: CDF of the number of distinct APs a client associates
with over the course of the trace.
Using this deﬁnition, we detect a high frequency of oscillations
in the data. Figure 12 plots the number of oscillations per hour
for each client type. Overall, we see that 50% of clients oscillate
at least once an hour, and individual clients oscillate as frequently
as 2,900 times an hour (almost once a second). The rate of os-
cillation varies between client types, with modems exhibiting the
lowest rate of oscillation—likely because they are physically ﬁxed,
and oscillate only due to environmentally induced signal strength
variation—and smartphones the highest. We eliminate oscillations
from the association data used in the remainder of this section in an
attempt to more accurately capture physical movement—as distinct
from RF movement due to changes in signal strength.
5.2 Movement
We plot the number of distinct APs to which a client associates
during the course of our trace in Figure 13. Roughly 35% of all de-
vices associate with only one AP; this corresponds well to the frac-
tion of clients that appear only once in the trace (c.f., Section 4.2.1).
As one might expect, each client class exhibits markedly differ-
ent association behavior. Modems tend to associate with a very
few number of APs—likely nearby to a single physical location.
Smartphones, on the other hand, frequently associate with a large
number of APs; 50% of smartphones associate with at least six
distinct APs, and the most wide-ranging of 10% smartphones as-
sociate with over 32 APs. Hotspot clients, on the other hand, are
signiﬁcantly less mobile—the 90% percentile associates with less
than 16 APs during the four-week trace. We observe, however, that
both the smartphone and hotspot populations are skewed by a sig-
niﬁcant number of clients that appear only once in the entire trace.
If we restrict the time window to a day—as opposed to 28 days
as above—the distribution shifts considerably (not shown): 90% of
all clients connect to at most eight APs per day on average, with
only a handful of clients connecting to more than 16 APs. Fully
90% of modems, 70% of hotspot users, and 40% of smartphones
connect to only one AP per day on average.
Next, we consider how geographically disperse these APs are.
In particular, we study the distance traveled between consecutive
associations by a single client. Figure 14 plots the average distance
in meters between non-oscillatory client associations. Not surpris-
ingly, very few devices associate with APs less than 100 meters
apart, as there are few locations in the city with closely spaced APs
(the library is a notable exception). At the other extreme, we see
devices that travel over six miles between associations—roughly
the maximum distance between APs in the network.
It is frequently possible to connect to a number of different APs
from one physical location. If we assume that modem devices move
infrequently (most are likely installed in users’ homes), we can in-
fer that the Google WiFi signal travels at most 500 meters from
an AP. Moreover, by considering the number of APs with which
modems associate in Figure 13, we conclude that most locations in
the city (where WiFi modems are installed) can reach at most four
APs. While this contrasts with the reported connectivity of Tropos

nodes (c.f., Section 3.1.1), APs are outﬁtted with commercial-grade
antennae and located on top of light poles, which frequently pro-
vides line-of-sight signal propagation to nearby APs.
While smartphones appear to travel further than hotspot clients
on average, both show signiﬁcant range. The median smartphone
travels well over half a mile (approximately 1050 meters) be-
tween associations, compared to a quarter mile for hotspot clients.
The 90-th percentile smartphone travels just slightly farther—1200
meters—than the median, while hotspot usage is more varied: the
90-th percentile user travels almost three times as far as the median.
Finally, to understand how fast clients are moving, we plot the
pause time between associations in Figure 15.
Interestingly, we
note that smartphones rarely re-associate in less than thirty seconds,
but usually within two minutes. In contrast, a signiﬁcant fraction
of modems go very long periods without re-associating (likely be-
cause the remain constantly attached to the same AP). The majority
of hotspot users, on the other hand, re-associate between ten sec-
onds and one minute after their last association.
If one considers a scatter plot of AP distance as a function of
pause time (not shown), there is high density along the y axis (in-
stantaneous reassociation) until about 750 meters, with a (comfort-
ing) void delineated by roughly the 75 mph line. Symmetrically,
we see a signiﬁcant portion of users that reassociate roughly 200
meters away over all time scales, indicating varying rates of travel
between adjacent APs. The graph is signiﬁcantly less dense in the
regions slower than ﬁve minutes and further than 500 meters, how-
ever.
6. COVERAGE
So far, we have considered characteristics of the users of the net-
work. In this section, we turn our attention to the network itself and
ask two distinct questions. First, we consider whether the network
is utilized differently in different parts of the city. Secondly, we
ask to what extent the full coverage of the network is necessary—
in other words, is it possible to deactivate certain APs from time to
time and preserve the overall user experience.
6.1 Diversity
The usage of the Google WiFi network varies based on physical
location. Table 3 considers three disjoint regions of the city—one
residential, one commercial, and one simply a thruway (Highway
