Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode and NameSystem components of a distributed file system performing various operations. The DataNode is receiving blocks from other nodes, responding to packets, and sending blocks to other nodes. The NameSystem is adding stored blocks to the block map, asking nodes to replicate blocks, and deleting blocks.
