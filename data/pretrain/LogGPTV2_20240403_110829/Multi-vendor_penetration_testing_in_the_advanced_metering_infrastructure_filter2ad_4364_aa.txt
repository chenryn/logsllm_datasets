Executive Summary 
Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is an integrated 
system of smart meters, communications networks, and 
data management systems that enables two-way 
communication between utilities and customers. The 
system provides a number of important functions that 
were not previously possible or had to be performed 
manually, such as the ability to automatically and 
remotely measure electricity use, connect and 
disconnect service, detect tampering, identify and isolate 
outages, and monitor voltage. Combined with customer 
technologies, such as in-home displays and 
programmable communicating thermostats, AMI also 
enables utilities to offer new time-based rate programs 
and incentives that encourage customers to reduce peak 
demand and manage energy consumption and costs.  
This report shares key results and benefits from the 70 
SGIG projects implementing AMI and customer system 
technologies, and also documents lessons learned on 
technology installation and implementation strategies. 
With this report, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
aims to further accelerate grid modernization by helping 
decision makers better assess the benefits and costs of 
AMI and customer system investments and learn from 
leading-edge utilities.  
The Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) Program 
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
(ARRA) of 2009 provided DOE with $3.4 billion to 
invest in 99 SGIG projects to modernize the 
electric grid, strengthen cybersecurity, improve 
interoperability, and collect smart grid impact 
data. Electricity industry recipients matched or 
exceeded this investment dollar-for-dollar. 
Deployment of AMI and customer systems 
accounted for more than two-thirds of the $7.9 
billion total SGIG investment. SGIG projects 
invested in new communication networks and 
information management systems that form the 
backbone of AMI, and tested:  
 16.3 million smart meters—29% of total U.S. 
smart meters installed by 2014 
 250,000 programmable communicating 
thermostats (PCTs) 
 400,000 direct load control (DLC) devices 
 100,000 in-home displays (IHDs) 
 417,000 participants in time-based rate and 
incentive programs  
 49 customer web portals 
Major Findings 
SGIG projects demonstrated that AMI and customer systems can achieve substantial grid impacts and 
benefits for customers and utilities, including: 
and timely billing, fewer customer disputes, and improvements in operational efficiencies.  
customer tools (e.g., web portals and smart thermostats) and techniques (e.g., shifting demand 
to off-peak periods).  
→ Reduced costs for metering and billing from fewer truck rolls, labor savings, more accurate 
→ More customer control over electricity consumption, costs, and bills from greater use of new 
→ Lower utility capital expenditures and customer bill savings resulting from reduced peak 
→ Lower outage costs and fewer inconveniences for customers from faster outage restoration 
demand and improvements in asset utilization and maintenance. 
and more precise dispatching of repair crews to the locations where they are needed.

AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
Operations and maintenance (O&M) cost savings from remote billing and metering services is a 
major benefit stream for the AMI business case. Operational efficiencies enhanced revenue 
collection and improved customer service and satisfaction. 
•  Remote meter reading generates more timely, 
accurate bills, eliminating the need for manual 
truck rolls and labor to read meters, 
connect/disconnect service, and diagnose 
many meter issues. Large-scale deployments 
and utilities with low customer densities or 
geographically dispersed territories had the 
greatest savings potential.  
•  Utilities with AMI are now able to fulfill remote 
service connection and disconnection orders in 
hours instead of days. 
Over a 3-year period, SGIG projects cumulatively:1 
Saved $316 million in O&M costs—an 
average of $16.6 million per project 
reporting 
Avoided 13.7 million truck rolls and 68.3 
million vehicle-miles traveled 
Saved an estimated 15,160 tons of CO2 
equivalent emissions 
•  Many utilities improved billing accuracy, 
reduced customer complaints, and used AMI data to resolve billing disputes faster. AMI enables 
utilities to proactively identify and notify customers of unusual usage patterns in advance of 
bills. 
•  Pre-pay billing plans helped customers to manage consumption and costs. Several utilities 
CenterPoint Energy reported total AMI 
cost savings of more than $61 million from 
2012-2014. Tamper detection functions 
alone prevented revenue losses exceeding 
$450,000 in 2012 and $130,000 in 2014. 
improved revenue collection and cost 
recovery by implementing pre-pay billing 
programs that can help customers avoid 
defaulting on bills. 
•  New capabilities for tamper and theft 
detection through AMI deployments enhance 
revenue collection and lower costs.  
AMI became an important contributor to outage management, service restoration, and voltage 
monitoring for many SGIG projects, particularly those that implemented AMI alongside 
investments in distribution automation technologies. 
•  AMI enables utilities to isolate outages faster 
and dispatch repair crews more precisely, 
reducing outage duration, limiting 
inconvenience, and reducing labor hours and 
truck rolls for outage diagnosis and 
restoration.  
Burbank Water and Power sends last-gasp 
alerts from its smart meters to the Outage 
Management System within 2 minutes, 
where its Geographic Information System 
updates an outage map. 
•  Utilities facing regular, severe weather events and storm-induced outages have greater 
incentives for using AMI for outage management than those that do not. 
1 O&M cost savings data: 19 projects reporting from 2011-2014; avoided truck roll data: 42 projects reporting from summer 
2011-winter 2014; avoided vehicle-miles: 21 projects reporting from summer 2011-winter 2014; emissions data: analysis of 
vehicle operations data from 31 SGIG projects from April 2011-March 2015.

•  AMI data integration with other information and management systems, including outage 
management systems (OMS) and geographic information systems (GIS), enabled utilities to 
create detailed outage maps, and in some cases posted these maps on utility websites to keep 
the public informed on service restoration progress. 
•  Voltage monitoring provides another promising 
benefit stream to include in business case analysis of 
AMI investments. Utilities can use AMI voltage 
monitoring capabilities to enhance the effectiveness 
of automated controls for voltage and reactive 
power management, particularly for conservation 
voltage reduction (CVR) programs.  
Central Lincoln Peoples Utility 
District piloted a CVR program that 
resulted in a 2% energy savings for 
all customers—and plans to 
implement it system-wide 
AMI and customer systems provided utilities with new capabilities to offer time-based rate, 
incentives, and DLC programs. This enabled utilities to reduce peak demand, lower wholesale 
power purchase costs, sell excess electricity to regional markets, and defer investments in new 
generation and delivery capacity. 
More than 417,000 customers participated in one or more time-based rate or incentive programs under 
SGIG, including critical peak pricing (CPP), variable peak pricing (VPP), time-of-use (TOU) pricing, and 
critical peak rebates (CPR). In particular, a subset of 10 utilities participated in the Consumer Behavior 
Studies (CBS), which evaluated different recruitment strategies, rate structures, and customer systems 
for customer acceptance, retention, and response. 
•  CBS utilities implemented programs in which 
customers reduced their peak demand by up to 
23.5 percent. 
•  Several utilities found that programmable 
Oklahoma Gas & Electric reported 
average annual electricity savings of 
$191.78 for participating residential 
customers and $570.02 for 
commercial customers 
communicating thermostat (PCT) automation 
enabled greater peak demand reductions than 
manual responses. Participating customers at five CBS utilities testing PCTs reduced average 
peak demand by 30% with CPP and 29% with CPR.  
In-home displays (IHDs) were less helpful, and in many cases, participating customers declined 
to use them or used them for a short period of time. 
• 
Key Lessons and Conclusions 
Many Factors Affect the AMI Business Case 
AMI system implementation costs and benefits varied widely across the projects, for a variety of reasons 
discussed below. For example, the per-meter deployment cost ranged from $130 to $1,895 per meter 
across the SGIG projects. However, only six projects reported a total installation cost above $600 per 
meter. The range of O&M cost savings across projects was also large: 19 projects reported a cumulative 
three-year savings of $316 million, yet more than $174 million of that was saved by one project alone. 
These results gave important insight into the multiple factors that determine an individual utility’s AMI 
implementation cost and return on investment: 
6 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
•  Full- and partial-scale implementations generally had a lower total cost per meter than pilot-
scale projects because AMI communications network upgrades, data management system 
integration, and other fixed installation costs make up more than half of the total cost per meter 
on average. These costs varied for each utility based on the scope of the project. 
•  Communication networks upgrades designed to support additional smart grid functionalities 
beyond AMI raised the total cost for some utilities, but increased the value of the investment 
and helped utilities set the stage for future grid modernization. 
•  Purchasing and enabling multiple smart meter features and integrating AMI with a larger 
number of systems can both raise the total AMI implementation cost, but also increase the 
value of benefits to support the business case. 
•  The utility’s level of experience with AMI systems and the pre-project state of the existing 
communications, data management, and metering systems largely affected the overall cost. 
•  Geographically dispersed utilities with low customer densities in some cases found a favorable 
business case for AMI from the operational savings alone. 
•  Customer outreach and education contributed to overall cost, and varied by project. 
Communications Networks Create More Value When Designed to Serve Smart Grid Technology 
Needs Beyond AMI 
Utilities accrue additional advantages when they design communications networks that have the 
bandwidth, latency requirements, and capacity to serve other needs, such as distribution automation 
(DA) and demand-side management (DSM), in addition to metering and billing.  
More robust communications networks constitute the backbone of not only a smart grid, but also 
smart cities. Several utilities adopted long-term, comprehensive smart grid strategies that included 
building communications networks with large capacities to handle future smart grid applications, and 
with high bandwidth to accommodate additional city services beyond electricity metering—such as gas 
and water metering and internet services. 
Systems Integration is a Critical Linchpin for AMI Impacts and Benefits 
Efficient and accurate billing and metering services require integration of AMI, meter data management 
systems (MDMS), customer information systems (CIS), and billing systems. Further integrating AMI with 
OMS, distribution management systems (DMS), and other DA systems can increase the benefits of each 
individual smart grid technology—making system integration both a top priority and a major technical 
challenge for many utilities. 
Integrating meter data with other systems and functions often required additional development to 
provide software fixes after the fact, which often resulted in unexpected costs and schedule delays. The 
majority of projects reported that this was one of the most important lessons learned about 
investments in AMI and customer systems. Integration of AMI and CIS with web portals, time-based 
rates, incentive programs, and customer devices such as PCTs, IHDs, home area networks (HANs), and 
energy management systems is also a new area involving rapidly evolving technologies and needs for 
upgraded standards and data transfer protocols. In addition, it is essential to integrate cybersecurity and 
interoperability for smart grid success. 
7 
Workforce Management and Training are Critical to AMI Success 
Many of the SGIG projects made organizational changes in metering, customer service, marketing, and 
distribution operations, particularly in areas that require enhanced levels of integration of both new 
information systems and job functions. In many instances, these changes involved workforce training 
programs to develop new skillsets in areas such as database management, data analytics and 
visualization, interoperability, and cybersecurity. 
Future Directions and Next Steps 
With the SGIG projects complete, the majority of SGIG recipients are building upon project results by 
expanding technology deployments, offering successful pilot programs to more customers, or improving 
the integration of AMI with other data and information management systems to extract additional value 
or activate new smart meter capabilities that were not yet tested. Many utilities with pilot AMI 
deployments now plan to expand smart meters to more customers. 
DOE continues to support grid modernization through research, development, demonstration, 
analysis, and technology transfer activities. New technologies are driving changes in electric power on 
multiple fronts. The need for stronger national efforts to modernize the grid for the cost-effective 
integration of renewable and distributed generation, energy efficiency and demand response, and 
cybersecurity and interoperability standards is essential.  
While the SGIG program is now complete, grid modernization and consumer engagement remain 
important national priorities. DOE’s Grid Modernization Initiative (GMI) recently released a Grid 
Modernization Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP) that describes the challenges and opportunities for 
achieving a modern, secure, sustainable, and reliable grid, and how DOE will enable this through 
programs and activities. The Grid Modernization Lab Consortium, a multi-year collaboration among 14 
DOE National Laboratories and regional networks, will assist DOE in developing and implementing the 
activities in the MYPP.2  
AMI deployments highlighted several continuing challenges for grid modernization that the industry 
should address to maintain momentum from the SGIG projects:  
•  Advances in data analytics could help utilities extract additional benefits from the large volume 
of interval load data produced by AMI. 
•  Consistent data formats and more comprehensive interoperability standards are needed to 
achieve optimal levels of interoperability for smart meters, customer devices, and 
communications and information systems. 
•  Maintaining strong cybersecurity and customer privacy protections will be a key focus for 
utilities as AMI deployments grow.  
•  There are many opportunities to make smart appliances and building energy management 
equipment on the customer’s side of the meter more “grid-friendly.”  
•  Continued innovations in mobile device applications and tools can make near-real-time data on 
consumption and costs available to customers when and how they need it.

Grid Investment Grants  
In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched the Smart Grid Investment Grant (SGIG) 
program—funded with $3.4 billion dollars from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 
2009—to jumpstart modernization of the nation’s electricity system, strengthen cybersecurity, improve 
interoperability, and collect an unprecedented level of data on smart grid and customer operations. 
When matched with an additional $4.5 billion in industry investment, the 99 SGIG projects invested a 
total of $7.9 billion in new smart grid technology and equipment for transmission, distribution, 
metering, and customer systems (see Figure 1). 
The large public and private investments made under ARRA have accelerated smart grid technology 
deployments, providing real-world data on technology costs and benefits along with valuable lessons 
learned and best practices. This report informs electric utilities, policymakers, and other key 
stakeholders of the qualitative and quantitative impacts, benefits, costs, and lessons learned from SGIG 
projects that implemented advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and customer systems. The SGIG 
program concluded in 2015, making this DOE’s final report on AMI and customer system results.

Industry and government collectively invested $5.21 billion in projects testing one or more AMI and 
customer technologies—accounting for more than two-thirds (67 percent) of the total SGIG 
investment. Projects with AMI or customer systems components represent 70 of the 99 total SGIG 
recipients. Electric utilities led 67 of the AMI and customer system projects, while vendors or service 
providers led the remaining 3.3 While nearly all projects deployed a combination of both AMI and 
customer system technologies, six program participants focused only on customer systems. 
3 The three non-utility projects were led by Honeywell, M2M, and Whirlpool.

(Many of these 70 AMI and customer system projects also installed new distribution automation [DA] 
technologies and systems. Project results specific to those DA technologies are reported separately in 
Distribution Automation: Results from the SGIG Program.) 
Participants used the funds to purchase, test, and install hardware and software; conduct training; 
improve cybersecurity protections; integrate smart grid technologies with key utility systems; collect 
and analyze data; and conduct other tasks needed for successful completion of project objectives.  
Full descriptions and results of all projects can be found on 
SmartGrid.gov. This report highlights select projects that 
exemplify the wide range of results and lessons learned 
from the SGIG AMI and customer system projects.  
1.1  AMI and Customer Technologies and Functions Deployed in SGIG 
AMI applies smart control and communication technologies to automate metering functions that have 
been typically accomplished through manually intensive operations, including electricity meter readings, 
service connection and disconnection, tamper and theft detection, fault and outage identification, and 
voltage monitoring. Combined with advanced customer-based technologies, AMI also enables utilities to 
offer new rate options that incentivize customers to reduce peak demand and energy consumption (see 
Figure 2).  
AMI deployment typically consists of three key components:  
data in 5-, 15-, 30-, or 60-minute intervals. 
→  Smart meters installed at the customer’s premise that typically collect electricity consumption 
→  New or upgraded communications networks to transmit the large volume of interval load data 
→  A meter data management system (MDMS) to store and process the interval load data, and to 
from the meter to the utility back offices. 
integrate meter data with one or more key information and control systems, including head-end 
systems, billing systems, customer information systems (CIS), geographic information systems 
(GIS), outage management systems (OMS), and distribution management systems (DMS). (Not 
all utilities used an MDMS.) 
Customer systems include both information and control technologies that aim to help customers 
more actively manage their electricity consumption and associated costs—particularly in response to 
time-based rates:  
→  Control technologies include devices such as programmable communicating thermostats (PCTs) 
and direct load control (DLC) devices that utilities and customers use to automatically control 
customers’ heating and cooling systems or other energy-intensive devices. In addition, home-
area networks (HAN) and energy management systems can be installed to automatically 
control appliances in response to price signals, load conditions, or pre-set preferences. 
10 
AMI and Customer Systems: Results from the SGIG Program 
→  Information technologies encourage customers to better manage their electricity consumption 
by providing them with near real-time data about their electricity consumption and costs 
through in-home displays (IHDs), web portals, and text/email. Web portals and IHDs provide 
information in visually appealing ways to improve understanding and insight about actions that 
can save energy and reduce bills. Web portals often provide electricity “dashboards” that give 
customers access to their historical and near-real-time usage information. IHDs and mobile 
devices offer alerts on electricity usage and notification of critical peak events. 
Figure 2. AMI and Customer Systems Work Together to  
Automate Functions and Manage Demand-Side Consumption 
Advanced Metering Infrastructure 
Over half of the 64 AMI utilities implemented full-scale smart meter deployments that covered more 
than 90 percent of customers (see Figure 3). These projects used DOE funds to modernize their entire 
metering infrastructure and most took advantage of several of the new functions and capabilities 
enabled by AMI. 
Eleven projects chose to deploy smart meters on a pilot scale (to less than 20 percent of customers), 
seeking to test meter installation and operation, and find the most cost-effective applications, before 
deciding to commit to system-wide deployments. The 20 remaining SGIG AMI projects implemented 
11 
partial deployments, and may later expand to 
system-wide deployments. SGIG funding 
accelerated plans and enabled broader use of new 
AMI functions and capabilities for all participating 
utilities. 
Smart Meters 
The core element of AMI is smart meters, which 
provide a number of functions, including 
measuring customer electricity consumption on 5-, 
15-, 30-, or 60-minute intervals; measuring voltage 
levels; and monitoring the on/off status of electric 
service. Smart meters communicate these readings 
to utilities for processing, analysis, and re-
communication back to customers for billing, 
energy feedback, and time-based rates.
