Certainly! Here is a more polished and coherent version of your text:

---

I have created a Docker image that includes Python libraries and Jupyter. I start the container with the option `-p 8888:8888` to map the ports between the host and the container. When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container using the command `jupyter notebook`, it runs on `localhost:8888` but does not automatically open a browser.

**Question:** 
From my host machine, what IP address should I use to access Jupyter in the host's browser?

**Additional Information:**
- When I run the `ifconfig` command, I see interfaces such as `eth0`, `docker0`, `wlan0`, and `lo`.

**Solution:**
To resolve this, I used the following command to run the container:

```sh
docker run -i -t -p 8888:8888 continuumio/anaconda3 /bin/bash -c "/opt/conda/bin/conda install jupyter -y --quiet && mkdir /opt/notebooks && /opt/conda/bin/jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=/opt/notebooks --ip='*' --port=8888 --no-browser --allow-root"
```

By adding the `--allow-root` flag, the Jupyter notebook server now runs successfully.

This version is more structured and clearly presents the problem, the question, and the solution.
