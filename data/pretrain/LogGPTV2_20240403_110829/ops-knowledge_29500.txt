If you are using Linux and want to identify the process spawned by a specific Python command, such as `shutil.copyfile`, you can use a combination of tools and techniques to achieve this. Since the `ps` command and `htop` might not be sufficient due to the instantaneous nature of the command, here’s a more detailed approach:

### Using `strace`
`strace` is a powerful tool that can trace system calls and signals. You can use it to monitor the execution of your Python script and see the processes it spawns.

1. **Run `strace` on your Python script:**
   ```sh
   strace -f -o strace_output.txt -e trace=clone,execve python3 your_script.py
   ```
   - `-f`: Follow child processes.
   - `-o strace_output.txt`: Save the output to a file for easier analysis.
   - `-e trace=clone,execve`: Trace only the `clone` and `execve` system calls, which are typically used to spawn new processes.

2. **Analyze the `strace` output:**
   Open `strace_output.txt` and look for the `clone` and `execve` system calls. These will give you information about the processes being created and the commands they are executing.

### Using `htop` with Filters
If you prefer a more interactive approach, you can use `htop` with filters to focus on Python processes:

1. **Run `htop`:**
   ```sh
   htop
   ```

2. **Enter Tree Mode:**
   - Press `F5` to switch to tree mode, which shows processes in a hierarchical view.

3. **Set a Filter:**
   - Press `F4` to open the filter dialog.
   - Type `python` and press `Enter`. This will show only the processes that match the filter, including those spawned by your Python script.

### Using `ps` with a Loop
If you need a more automated approach, you can use a loop to continuously check for new processes:

```sh
while true; do ps aux | grep 'python' && sleep 0.1; done
```

- This command will continuously list all processes and filter for those containing `python` in their command line. The `sleep 0.1` ensures that the loop runs frequently enough to catch short-lived processes.

### Example Script
Here’s a small example script that uses `shutil.copyfile` and how you might trace it:

```python
import shutil
import time

# Simulate a delay to make it easier to catch the process
time.sleep(2)

# Copy a file
shutil.copyfile('source.txt', 'destination.txt')
```

Save this script as `your_script.py` and run it with `strace` or use the `htop` method described above.

By using these methods, you should be able to identify the processes spawned by your Python command more effectively.
