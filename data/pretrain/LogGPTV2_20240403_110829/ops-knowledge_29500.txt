User: I am on Linux and wish to find the process spawned by a Python command. 
Example: shutil.copyfile. 
How do I do so? 
Generally I have just read the processes from the terminal with ps however this command completes nearly instantaneously so I cannot do that for this without some lucky timing.
htop doesn't show the info, strace seems to show a lot of info but I can't seem to get the process in it.
Assistant: Would running a filter in htop be quick enough?
Run htop, Press F5 to enter tree mode, then F4 to filter, and type in python... it should show all the python processes as they open/close
