route (assumed to be ﬁxed for the duration of the call) and
a wavelength, ﬁxed from start to end of the route. Opaque
networks, which allow wavelength conversion within a route,
are beyond the scope of this paper. Links are assumed to
be unidirectional and each link can carry C channels (wave-
lengths) simultaneously. A model for a lightpath is depicted
in Fig. 6. The ﬁgure represents the lightpath and the sources
of physical impairments considered in this paper. Other
physical devices such as dispersion compensators and mul-
tiplexers/demultiplexers, which are assumed not to further
degrade the signal’s SNR, are not represented here. At the
source of a call, a transmitter, located at an OXC, modu-
lates data and sends it over optical ﬁber as an on-oﬀ keyed
signal over a given wavelength. As it is transmitted over
the optical ﬁber, the signal sustains chromatic dispersion
and self-phase modulation which combine and contribute to
intersymbol interference (ISI).
The transmitted signal
is also subject to nonlinear
crosstalk, that is, the nonlinear interaction with other sig-
nals that are transmitted simultaneously over the same ﬁber
spans: cross-phase modulation and four-wave mixing. Op-
tical ampliﬁers inject ampliﬁer spontaneous emission (ASE)
noise, and the signal is also subject to node crosstalk, which
refers to signal leakages caused, for instance, by imperfect
ﬁltering at the nodes [12]. We refer the reader to [23], [22],
[9], [15] for more details regarding the models of ASE noise,
nonlinear crosstalk, node crosstalk, and their combined ef-
fects, respectively. Note that we ignore here a number of
physical impairments such as receiver noise and polariza-
tion mode dispersion, but these eﬀects can be incorporated
easily in our model as additional noise variances, as will be
seen shortly. Fig. 6 also illustrates the physical degradation
of the transmitted signal in terms of an eye diagram; at the
receiver, the eye diagram gets closed, thereby indicating a
degraded SNR.
We denote by μ0 and μ1 the means of the distributions of
the “0” and “1” samples, respectively, and by σ0 and σ1 their
standard deviations. Let
Q =
μ1 − μ0
σ0 + σ1
(6)
be the Q-factor associated with the considered lightpath.
The Q-factor can be interpreted as a signal-to-noise ratio,
from which we can derive the bit-error rare, using a Gaussian
assumption [1]:

erfc(Q/
BER =

We model each of the physical impairments described
above by a noise variance in the SNR of the signal. Assuming
these eﬀects are statistically independent, these variances
due to these eﬀects are additive. Let σ2
isi be the noise vari-
ance caused by ISI, σ2
ase the noise variance caused by ASE
noise, σ2
nl the noise variance caused by nonlinear crosstalk,
and σ2
oxc the noise variance caused by node crosstalk, then
we have σ2
oxc. Therefore, deter-
mining the BER of a lightpath boils down to determining
four quantities, which can be measured at receivers using
adapted equipment: μ0, μ1, σ0, σ1. In the remainder of this
section, the BER estimation for a lightpath designates the
simultaneous estimation of these four quantities.
ase + σ2
isi + σ2
nl + σ2
1 = σ2
In this work, we consider that the BER of a lightpath
depends only on the network state, that is, on the network
topology and on the lightpaths that are already established
in the network. Indeed, in our model a Q factor depends
on the topology via μ0, μ1, σ0, σisi, σase, and the crosstalk
injected by other lightpaths via σoxc and σnl. In particu-
lar, we consider that the network is an event-driven system
where events are lightpath establishment and tear-down. A
timestep here thus consists in the arrival or the termination
of new call. Cases where BERs vary between calls arrivals
and departure, e.g., because of link failures, can be easily
dealt with by sampling the BER measurements on a regular
basis. Therefore, in this section, we denote by k a timestep
(equivalently, a network state) and call y(k)
σ0 , and
y(k)
σ0 the vectors of the quantities we want to estimate, re-
spectively, μ0, μ1, σ0 and σ1 for all lightpaths established at
time k. We denote by G(k) ∈ R
p ×nl the routing matrix at
time k, where n(k)
is the number of established lightpaths
at time k and nl is the number of (unidirectional) links in
the network. Each row of G(k) corresponds to an established
lightpath and G(k)
i,j = 1 when lightpath i uses link j. Con-
trary to the network delay case, here G(k) varies with k —
in particular, the routing matrices at two diﬀerent timesteps
may not even have the same number of rows.

Our goal here is to estimate the BER of all lightpaths, at
all timesteps, given a reduced number of lightpaths have ac-
tually been observed. To do so, we are using the spatial and
time correlation between lightpaths. The spatial correlation
is induced by the physical behavior of the network: physical
impairments are caused at the link level and thus the BERs
of two diﬀerent lightpaths (on diﬀerent wavelengths) sharing
links are correlated. The time correlation is induced by the
stationarity of the BERs with time; between two timesteps,
only one lightpath can be established or torn down, thus the
BER of a given lightpath between times k and k + 1 varies
little. Before we turn to the estimation problem, which will
again be expressed in the diﬀusion wavelet framework, we
ﬁrst address the problem of sample (lightpath) selection,
which we recast as the problem of physically placing BER
monitor devices in an all-optical network.
6.2 BER Monitor Placement
In the context of all-optical networks, it is not possible to
observe samples (that is, to measure the BER of lightpaths)
independently from one time step to the next. Monitors are
physical devices that cannot be moved from one site to an-
other. Each monitor is located at a node, at the end of a link,
and all lightpaths that terminate at this link can be observed
— each monitor can thus observe up to C lightpaths simul-
taneously. However, lightpaths traversing but not ending at
a monitored link cannot be observed by the BER monitor
since those lightpaths’ signals remain in the optical domain.
If we could equip all links with a BER monitor, then the
BER of all lightpaths in the network would be known at all
times. However, this brute force monitoring scheme is very
expensive and does not scale. In this section, we consider
the scenario where we are given a ﬁxed budget, or, equiva-
lently, a number M of BER monitors. The problem is thus
to select links where the monitors should be placed so as to
facilitate the estimation of BERs of the lightpaths that are
not directly observed. This corresponds to the second path
selection scenario described in Section 4.
Note that the physical constraint that BER monitors are
ﬁxed is actually very restrictive. BER monitors are ﬁxed be-
fore the network starts operating. The number of observed

lightpaths varies with time and it is possible that no light-
path is observed at all if no established lightpath ends at
a link where a monitor is placed. The freedom to observe
diﬀerent (light)paths at diﬀerent timesteps is lost. The sit-
uation is made substantially more complex if alternate or
adaptive routing is used. In alternate routing, K > 1 short-
est paths are pre-computed between any two nodes, such
that if no wavelength is available on the shortest path be-
tween two nodes to accommodate some call, another route
can be chosen to accommodate the call; adaptive routing
can be viewed as the case K = ∞. Indeed, with ﬁxed non-
alternate routing (K = 1), we can exploit foreknowledge of
the routes used by lightpaths to place monitors. This is not
possible with alternate or adaptive routing. For the purpose
of path selection (but not estimation), we assume that rout-
ing is ﬁxed (non-alternate, non-adaptive) and K = 1. We
then compute the shortest path routing matrix and use this
in Algorithm 2, together with Cp derived from the diﬀusion
wavelet basis, to determine the locations of the monitors.
6.3 Numerical Results
We apply the estimation framework described in Section 2
to the bit-error case, estimating in turn μ1, μ0, σ1 and σ0
for all lightpaths, at all times. We simulate the operation
of an all-optical network where BERs are computed accord-
ing to the model described in Section 6.1. Physical-layer
parameters for the network are described in [15]. We simu-
lated the arrival and departure of 350 calls in a downscaled
version2 of the NSF network, depicted in Fig. 7. This topol-
ogy contains 14 nodes and 42 unidirectional links. We used
C = 8 wavelengths in the simulations and adaptive routing.
When a network starts operating, there is no lightpath yet
established in the network, and when a suﬃcient number of
calls have arrived, the number of lightpaths in the network
ceases to increase and the network operates in steady state.
Our simulation results only account for the steady-state op-
eration of the network, not for the initial period where calls
keep arriving without departing.
2It is currently not possible to build a continental-sized all-
optical network; we modeled a regional-sized network, based
on the NSF topology.

Figure 8: Compressibility of σ1 for τ = 8 timesteps
and L = 10 diﬀusion wavelet scales. All three other
metrics μ0, μ1 and σ0 exhibit a similarly fast decay
in the diﬀusion wavelet basis.
We illustrate the compressibility of each of the four met-
rics μ0, μ1, σ0 and σ1 for τ = 8 timesteps in Fig. 8. All
metrics are highly compressible in the diﬀusion wavelet ba-
sis, allowing for the utilization of the nonlinear estimation
framework.
We compare the performance of the nonlinear estimator in
a diﬀusion wavelet basis with the linear estimation frame-
work presented in [5]. Contrary to the nonlinear estima-
tion framework where correlation between end-to-end met-
rics is accounted for via the diﬀusion operator, the linear
estimation framework requires that there exist a linear re-
lation between the link-level and the end-to-end delay met-
rics. Although such a linear relation follows directly from
the physics of the problem in the end-to-end delay case,
such is not the case here. However, we can show that, after
appropriate transformations, each end-to-end metric can be
approximated by a linear combination of link-level metrics.
Recall that G(k) is the routing matrix of the network at
timestep k. In Section 2.1, the linear relation y(k) = G(k)x(k)
where y(k) is a per-path metric and x(k) a per-link metric was
induced by the additivity of the link delays to form end-to-
end delays. In the bit-error rate estimation case, the per-link
variances for (node and nonlinear) crosstalk are additive by
construction, suggesting that in the linear estimation frame-
work we should estimate the variance σ2
1 rather than esti-
mating the standard deviation σ1. This insight is veriﬁed in
Fig. 9 (bottom-right plot), where we plot the (end-to-end)
variances σ2
nl as a function of the length of a light-
path. The variances σ2
ase are approximately linear
with respect to the lightpath length; therefore the per-link
variances xσ12 are approximately additive (accounting for
an oﬀset which can be precomputed, and which is due to ISI
induced by the ﬁltering process at the receiver), leading to:
