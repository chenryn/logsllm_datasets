User: How can we invoke a python script using AIR 1.5?
Assistant: You cannot directly invoke system commands or run an executable (the python interpreter) from within an AIR application. If it's possible to share what exactly you want to do, maybe we can suggest alternatives. 
If it's really really (that's two reallys) important to run an executable from AIR lookup the CommandProxy demo.
