Julia 0.5 will ship with a versioned `libjulia.so.0.5` that is installed
system-wide for embedding by other programs. The standard library however is
still installed to an unversioned path, which is inconsistent and creates a
conflict when different versions of `libjulia.so.$(SOMAJOR)` are installed on
a system, since these will depend on different versions of the standard
library.
Therefore `base` and `test` should be installed to a versioned path
`$(prefix)/share/julia/$(SOMAJOR)`.
Likewise, `juliarc.jl` should be installed to
`$(prefix)/etc/julia/$(SOMAJOR)`.
This also affects the private libdir,
`$(prefix)/lib/$(MULTIARCH)/julia/$(SOMAJOR)`.
