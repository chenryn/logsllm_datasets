Julia 0.5 will include a versioned `libjulia.so.0.5` that is installed system-wide, allowing it to be embedded in other programs. However, the standard library is still installed in an unversioned path. This inconsistency can lead to conflicts when multiple versions of `libjulia.so.$(SOMAJOR)` are present on the same system, as each version depends on a different version of the standard library.

To resolve this issue, both the `base` and `test` directories should be installed in a versioned path, specifically `$(prefix)/share/julia/$(SOMAJOR)`. Similarly, the `juliarc.jl` file should be placed in `$(prefix)/etc/julia/$(SOMAJOR)`.

This change also impacts the private library directory, which should be located at `$(prefix)/lib/$(MULTIARCH)/julia/$(SOMAJOR)`.
