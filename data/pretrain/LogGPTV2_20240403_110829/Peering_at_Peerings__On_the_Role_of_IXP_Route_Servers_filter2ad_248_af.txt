that are at the RS. Thus, this Tier-1 also solely relies on bi-lateral
connections. The reason for its presence at the RS is unclear to us
but might be a hint towards early exploration of RS usage.
The regional eyeball providers, EYE1 and EYE2 both peer openly
utilizing the RS at both IXPs. We see all of the trafﬁc sent to these
members covered by their RS preﬁxes. While we notice a tendency
towards more ML peerings at the M-IXP vs. the L-IXP, both eye-
ball networks also use BL peerings, with EYE2 relying mostly on
BL sessions.
8.2 Players with hybrid peerings
Figure 7 (left lower part) clearly shows that some members only
peer bi-laterally at L-IXP or M-IXP. The other large group of mem-
bers consists of those that advertise all preﬁxes for which they re-
ceive trafﬁc via the RS but receive varying amounts of trafﬁc via
BL peerings. However, the more intriguing cases are those mem-
bers that occupy the small middle part in Figure 7 (e.g., around
x = 100) and advertise some preﬁxes via the RS, but receive traf-
ﬁc for a superset of these preﬁxes. While this fraction of members
is rather small compared to the overall number of members, we see
some important players here, carrying signiﬁcant trafﬁc volumes.
We select two cases, namely CDN, a mid-sized content delivery net-
work and NSP, a large transit provider. We have seen that content
providers typically advertise their preﬁxes openly and large tran-
sit providers advertise them more selectively. CDN and NSP differ
from these typical cases by following a “hybrid” peering strategy
by advertising some preﬁxes multi-laterally, some others only bi-
laterally to selected member ASes.
In the case of CDN, we ﬁnd that close to 90% of its incoming
trafﬁc is covered by the small number of openly advertised RS pre-
ﬁxes. However, this AS also has some 59 BL peering links, and
on most of them we see trafﬁc to a superset of the preﬁxes adver-
tised via the RS.14 We assume that this is as an example of complex
trafﬁc engineering performed by today’s CDNs that, in this case,
involves both using the vast connectivity provided by the RS, as
well as the application of more ﬁne-granular preﬁx advertisements
for speciﬁc networks, e.g., to fulﬁll performance requirements for
certain customers.
NSP advertises some 5K preﬁxes openly via the RS, and most
of them contain subsequent ASNs in the AS path that are not other
ASNs of the NSP. Nevertheless, most trafﬁc is exchanged via BL
peering sessions and only about 20% of NSP’s incoming trafﬁc is
covered by its RS preﬁxes. While at L-IXP, NSP receives traf-
ﬁc from most members ASes, many of them peer bi-laterally with
NSP and some of them send trafﬁc to a large superset of the preﬁxes
advertised via the RS. Interestingly, we see a very similar pattern
for NSP also at M-IXP where it receives about 45% of its trafﬁc
for preﬁxes advertised via the RS and the other part for a super-

sions by using the LGes of IXP members. Moreover we note that
the corresponding paths were prepended.
41set. Again, we validated the advertisement of a superset of preﬁxes
using LGes of IXP members having BL sessions with NSP. We
assume that NSP’s hybrid approach to peering is in support of its
main business (e.g., transit provider), and hints towards growing di-
versiﬁcation of models in the transit business (see e.g., [35], [23]).
We note that NSP is present at many IXPs and thus might have
more conﬁdence and experience in making use of RS functionality,
tailored to its business interests, than other transit providers.
Summary
Among the networks that have an open peering policy and utilize
IXP RSes, we observe a diverse set of players ranging from content
providers to eyeball networks. While many networks that utilize the
RS also rely on additional BL peerings, some only use the RS (i.e.,
no BL peerings) and others (particularly larger transit networks)
typically do not use RSes at all. We also observe networks with
hybrid peering strategies in the sense that they advertise parts of
their routes via the RS and others via BL peerings, hinting towards
advanced usage of RSes.
9. DISCUSSION
Our empirical study of real-world IXP RS deployments and how
IXP RSes are being used by a wide range of today’s Internet play-
ers has implications for IXP and network operators as well as re-
searchers.
9.1 On the beneﬁts of connecting to an IXP
The success of the large European IXPs is an example of a (pos-
itive) network effect “in action.” As these IXPs have been grow-
ing in size, their value for each of their members has increased,
but managing and maintaining the ensuing bi-lateral peerings (i.e.,
large number of corresponding BGP sessions) has became a bur-
den for many of these members. To alleviate this burden, these
IXPs have started to offer their members the free use of their route
servers, and this service has contributed to making those IXPs even
more attractive to yet more networks.
To quantify this attractiveness, our empirical results suggest a
concrete step that IXPs and network operators could take for effec-
tively evaluating the instant beneﬁts that a network can reap when
connecting (either directly or remotely) to an IXP. In particular, we
have seen that at our two IXPs, where a majority of the members
connect to the RS (i.e., more than 80% of the L-IXP’s members and
more than 90% of the M-IXP’s members), the preﬁxes advertised
by each of the two IXPs’ RSes cover some 80-95% of all trafﬁc
seen and include many of the most popular destinations. Thus,
if IXPs provide the proﬁle of routes that are advertised via their
RSes (e.g., via adequately-supported LGes), network operators can
immediately determine how much of their individual trafﬁc would
reach these destinations from “day one” (i.e., as soon as they start
connecting to the IXP’s RS). They can then compare the different
available interconnection options in terms of costs, performance
or other criteria to make an informed decision about which IXP(s)
they want to connect to and how they want to make use of the IXP’s
RS (see Section 8).
Although we lack comparable data from the other large Euro-
pean IXPs that operate a RS, the fact that a majority of their mem-
bers connect to the RS (e.g., some 70% at LINX, over 80% at
AMS-IX) suggests that their RSes cover a similarly large portion
of trafﬁc seen at those IXPs as observed at the L-IXP and M-IXP.
However, we caution against generalizing our RS-speciﬁc observa-
tions across the spectrum of IXPs worldwide. For example, even
in Europe there are large regional IXPs (e.g., NL-IX) where the re-
ported member participation at the RS is less than 50%. Looking
beyond Europe, while many of the larger IXPs in North America
operate a RS (e.g., Equinix, Any2), little is known about member
participation in the RS15 and typically no information is available
about the portion of trafﬁc covered by such an IXP’s RS.
9.2 A peering ecosystem in ﬂux
Our ﬁndings show that the popularity of the IXPs’ RSes has led
to a proliferation of ML peerings, but at this point, a majority of the
trafﬁc that is exchanged at a typical IXP is still exchanged via BL
peerings. However, as more networks explore how to best use their
many easy-to-establish and simple-to-maintain ML peerings (e.g.,
as back-up, as primary connection, only for certain trafﬁc or partic-
ular peers) and try to incorporate them into their complex peering
decision making processes, the current picture is bound to undergo
constant changes, especially if the IXPs keep on innovating and
improving RS functionalities and operations. Thus, new research
efforts are required for developing and deploying appropriate mon-
itoring infrastructures that yield reliable data for sensing the onset
of possible “sea changes” in the future Internet peering ecosystem
and also providing insight into the reasons for their occurrence.
In this context, although the IXP-provided data used in this study
is proprietary, we show in Section 4 how it can be put to good use by
increasing the value of certain publicly available datasets for future
studies by other researchers. For example, proprietary data often
enables a direct comparison between inferred connections (based
on publicly available information) and actual connections (based
on proprietary information), and we illustrate this capability in this
paper by calibrating the quality of the BGP measurements that are
becoming publicly available from RS-LGes in selective IXPs.
The use of such vetted public data would be of particular inter-
est in the context of monitoring the impact (or lack thereof) of the
recently launched Open IX (OIX) initiative [11]. This initiative’s
main objective is to bring more peering opportunities to the US
interconnection marketplace that has historically been dominated
by an inordinately small number of players whose main focus has
been on private peering offerings (i.e., cross connects). As a result
of this situation, prices for cross connects in the major metropolitan
areas in the US are about six times as high as in the major Euro-
pean cities, where peering opportunities are abundant, especially
in places with highly successful IXPs. Among the early develop-
ments related to the OIX initiative that was launched less than a
year ago are the establishment of new European-style IXPs in the
USA by the largest European IXPs (e.g., LINX in Northern Vir-
ginia [9], AMS-IX and DE-CIX in New York [1, 3]) and a formal
certiﬁcation process whereby the certiﬁed commercial data center
and colocation provider companies explicitly agree to house certi-
ﬁed IXPs in their facilities. Only time will tell if these early devel-
opments will bring about the “sea change” within the US peering
ecosystem that the supporters of OIX are advocating, but our ﬁnd-
ings point to concrete data collection efforts that should be pursued
to assess the actual impact of OIX in the US (e.g., encouraging the
deployment of RS-LGes by the IXPs in the US and the continuous
data collection from these emerging new vantage points).
9.3
Innovation in inter-domain routing
Based on our description of today’s RSes, their popularity is un-
derstandable because establishing connectivity in the control plane
via a RS is simple (i.e., requiring basically one BGP session setup),
efﬁcient (in terms of receiving routes to a signiﬁcant part of the In-
ternet), and quick (i.e., an ability to start exchanging trafﬁc from the
15A noteworthy exception is SIX in Seattle, which started offer-
ing RS services in 2014 and provides a Looking Glass showing
all members connecting to the RS and their advertised routes.
42get-go). In this sense, the relatively recent RS offerings by IXPs can
be viewed as a concrete example of an innovation in inter-domain
routing, an area that is notorious for resisting changes to or deploy-
ing improvements over the status quo (i.e., BGP).
More importantly, our discussions of the design and operations
of today’s IXP RSes show that they do not forward any data trafﬁc
and adhere to a strict separation of control plane and data plane.
This observation makes RS design and operations a prime candi-
date for Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN) which, in turn, sug-
gests that IXPs are natural places for harnessing SDN’s power to
improve if not revolutionize inter-domain routing. In fact, the con-
cept of a software deﬁned Internet exchange (SDX) is the topic of a
recent paper [27] in which the authors consider novel approaches to
innovation at the IXP RSes, including software support for a range
of policies for inter-domain trafﬁc engineering with BGP that are
either difﬁcult to perform using current RS capabilities or simply
out of reach for today’s RS implementations.
In fact, by describing how RSes are used in practice, our work
is complementary to [27] and raises a number of questions that are
mainly concerned with issues such as ﬂexibility, trust, and security.
Addressing these and related issues as part of the SDX effort would
have far-reaching implications, mainly because they have prevented
some of the larger players to rely and depend on the IXPs’ RSes.
For example, member ASes that want to control which preﬁxes are
advertised to which other member ASes typically have the BGP
know-how to peer bi-laterally to achieve the desired control over
the trafﬁc they receive. While the use of the RS does not preclude
such control, peering bi-laterally offers a member AS additional
opportunities for BGP trafﬁc engineering, e.g., AS-path prepend-
ing, MED, scoped advertisements [39] etc., that are currently not
fully supported by RSes. More generally, how to expand the effort
described in [27] to also include bi-lateral peering as part of the
proposed SDX approach looms as an interesting open problem.
With respect to trust-related issues, IXP operators are aware of
concerns that some of their member ASes have about RS avail-
ability, RS operations, RS monitoring/debugging capabilities, and
security at the RS.16 For example, there currently exist no SLAs
for the RS itself, but most of the IXPs operate redundant RSes.17
From an operational perspective, there are numerous opportunities
for misconﬁgurations at the RS (e.g., ﬁlter setup, mis-shapes with
routing registries), and the monitoring capabilities at today’s RSes
are still in their infancy. In terms of security, an RS adds an ad-
ditional middleman that has to be trusted with the proper handling
of all route advertisements. In this context, large IXPs may be op-
portune places for future deployment of BGP security mechanisms
such as sBGP [37].
10. CONCLUSION
Using a collection of IXP-provided datasets that offer unprece-
dented visibility into the control plane (i.e., BGP data from the RS)
and data plane (i.e., sFlow measurements) as seen at two Euro-
pean IXPs, we report in this paper on an in-depth study of IXP
RSes for the purpose of understanding an IXP’s full-ﬂedged public
peering fabric; that is, the existence of peerings (i.e., connectiv-
ity) as well as their usage (i.e., trafﬁc) and how they are used by
which player and for what reasons. In the process, we obtain an
accurate picture of the relative importance of ML peerings (large
in numbers, but responsible for only a minority of the trafﬁc) vs.
BL peerings (small in numbers, but carrying the bulk of the trafﬁc).
More importantly, when moving beyond the traditional link-level

perspective of peering and examining the correlation between the
control and data plane views at the preﬁx-level, reasoning about
which ASes peer with which other networks (e.g., how and for what
reasons) becomes feasible. This, in turn, leads to new insight into
how the IXPs’ RSes are used by their member ASes and demon-
strates that these RSes are quickly becoming critical enablers for
connectivity and, as a result, integral entities of today’s Internet
inter-domain routing system that deserve the full attention of net-
working researchers.
