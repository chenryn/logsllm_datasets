Pause mode
Pause mode is useful for performing maintenance on the PostgreSQL cluster
or DCS.
● The mode is cluster-wide (all nodes or no nodes)
● Takes up to loop_wait seconds for a node to be paused
● Nodes might not be paused simultaneously
● Automatic failover is disabled
● No automatic read-only mode when DCS is not accessible
● PostgreSQL is not shut down when Patroni is stopped
● PostgreSQL is not started automatically when shut down
● PostgreSQL master will update the leader key (or acquire it if it is not
taken)
However
● New replicas can be created
● Manual switchover/failover works

Synchronous replication
● synchronous_mode: true/false
Cluster-wide settings. Patroni will choose one of the replicas and set it to
be the synchronous one. Information about the synchronous replica is kept in
DCS. When the master dies patroni fails over only to the synchronous replica
(if it exists). Manual failover is possible to a non-synchronous one. If no
replica can be set to synchronous - the synchronous replication is disabled,
favoring availability over durability.
● synchronous_mode_strict: true/false
Works the same as a synchronous mode, but if no replicas can be set to
synchronous - the synchronous mode is retained and the master will not
accept any writes (*) until another synchronous replica is available, resulting
in no data loss
* - setting synchronous_commit to local or off per transaction will disable that
guarantee on a given transaction.

Extensibility
● Callbacks
○ client routing and server monitoring
● Custom replica creation methods
○ create replicas in the existing cluster with
methods other than pg_basebackup (i.e wal-e,
rsync)
● Custom bootstrap methods
○ initialize first node in the cluster with a custom
script (by default initdb is used)
○ useful to implement PITR or clone existing clusters
● post_bootstrap script
○ called after bootstrapping of the new cluster. If they
return non-zero - bootstrap is cancelled. One can
populate a database or create initial users from that
script.

Custom replica creation
● command is called for new replicas only when the cluster is
already present in DCS
● if method defines no_master - script will be called even when
there is no master (i.e. restore from the WAL archive)
● command must return 0 only on success
● when multiple methods are specified - they are executed one
by one until the first successful one, when no success - repeat
on the next iteration of the HA loop.
● basebackup is used when no methods are specified, can be
added explicitly with `basebackup` method name.

Custom bootstrap
● only one method allowed (initdb or custom)
● by default initdb is called
● /initialize lock is acquired before the method is called
○ only one custom bootstrap script runs at a given time
○ on success Patroni starts PostgreSQL node produced by the script
and waits until the node becomes the master (pg_is_in_recovery()
== false)
● on failure - the data directory is wiped out and /initialize lock is released
● after the successful bootstrap a post_boostrap script is called
● if post_boostrap script fails - the actions are the same as when the
bootstrap fails.
