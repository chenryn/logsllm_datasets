circuit establishment times (current versions of Tor already build
three circuits preemptively [1]) nor dramatically increases the prob-
ability of selecting a malicious entry OR [4]. Moreover, a variable
number of entry ORs for different page loads further reduces the
classification accuracy (columns “⟦2, 5⟧”). Here, a single malicious
entry OR is challenged by the uncertainty of the applied splitting
strategy as website-specific patterns are less deterministic.
Efficiency of Different Distributions. To find the most suit-
able splitting method, we next survey the efficiency of each strategy.

Round Robin & Random. Overall, we notice a slow decrease in
accuracy with the round robin strategy as the number of used
entry ORs increases. We observe a similar trend with a steeper
decline for the random strategy. Nonetheless, the accuracies of
CUMUL and DF still remain comparably high, corresponding to
the correct identification of most page loads. A reason is that both
strategies produce subtraces of similar size for different page load
traces belonging to the same website when applied in a setting with
a constant m. Moreover, round robin cannot completely hide the
total size of a given website—one of the most important features for
WFP attacks [7]—even when observing only a fraction of the page
load. Then again, both round robin and random strategies introduce
traffic diversity in a setting with a variable number of entry ORs,
resulting in accuracy drops of more than 10%. Unfortunately, this
drop is insufficient for a practical deployment.
By Direction. A simple scheme, which only splits the traffic by
direction, already delivers a significant decrease in accuracy for
all WFP attacks. Even though the number of transferred cells per
direction remains unaltered, most classifiers only recognize a third
of the page loads. This drop might be caused by the classifiers’
inability to retrieve information about the relationship between
incoming and outgoing cells. However, despite the absence of this
characteristic, k-FP profits from other features that use available
information on timing and data rate per direction, contributing to
a comparably high classification rate for this attack.
Weighted Random. Finally, when applying a weighted random
circuit selection, we observe a significant decrease in the accuracy
compared to the other strategies. All evaluated WFP attacks achieve
less than 35% accuracy. For the worst-performing classifier, k-NN,
the rate of reliably-detectable page loads drops below 4%. We believe
that this significant decrease is caused by the diversity in total
size among the different subtraces of a single website. A notable
observation is that a variable number of entry ORs (column “⟦2, 5⟧”)
does not improve the defense, since the strategy already introduces
sufficient diversity by design.
We conclude that a splitting strategy should generate subtraces
with highly diverse characteristics to serve as an effective defense.
Bandwidth and Latency Overhead. Since our defense oper-
ates without any dummy traffic, we assume that it will not intro-
duce significant overheads in bandwidth and time. However, our
multipathing method [14] requires the integration of new types
of Tor cells for circuit establishment and operation (sharing the
chosen splitting strategy with the middle OR). Our defense may
also require some extra time to build m circuits as well as to buffer
and sort out-of-order cells. Based on previous analysis of multi-
path approaches [4], we believe that these additions are acceptable,
especially since they support a promising defense.
6 CONCLUSION
We analyzed the effectiveness of different splitting mechanisms to
counter WFP and concluded that a simple distribution of traffic
across several entry ORs is insufficient to reduce the accuracy of
state-of-the-art classifiers. Our evaluation reveals that a weighted
random strategy decreases the accuracy of CUMUL, k-FP, and DF
to less than 35% (and k-NN below 4%) in a closed-world scenario.
For future work, we plan to implement our defense, along with
traffic splitting strategies, into Tor and evaluate its performance in
real-world settings. We also want to extend our experiments to an
open-world setting and consider the integration of traffic padding
to reduce the fingerprinting accuracies even further without in-
troducing noticeable overhead. Finally, we need to evaluate our
defense against adversaries who control multiple entry ORs.
