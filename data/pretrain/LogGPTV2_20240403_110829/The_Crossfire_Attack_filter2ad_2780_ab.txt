### B. Attack Setup

The adversary utilizes the acquired link map to identify a set of target links, the flooding of which would sever the maximum number of routes to the target area. The more routes that are cut off, the more potent the attack. This setup phase consists of two sub-steps:

1. **Flow-Density Computation:**
   The adversary analyzes the link map for the target area and calculates the 'target-specific attack-flow density' (or simply 'flow density') for each network link in the map. Flow density is defined as the number of flows between bots and target-area servers that can be established through a given link. This metric is specific to the target area and can vary significantly from one area to another. It should not be confused with metrics used for Internet connectivity, such as "betweenness centrality" [20] and the degree of routers [18, 19].

   A high flow density for a link indicates that it carries a large number of both attack and legitimate flows to a specific target area, making it a prime target for an attack. We found that flow density follows a power-law distribution in the link map, allowing the adversary to easily identify a set of high flow density links that carry most of the traffic to the target area. Additionally, the computed flow density remains relatively stable for several hours due to the long-term stability of Internet routes [27, 21]. This stability makes flow density a reliable metric for selecting target links.

2. **Target-Link Selection:**
   In this step, the adversary identifies multiple disjoint sets of target links to be flooded. At least two disjoint sets are selected, and they are used sequentially to achieve attack persistence (refer to Section II-D). The objective is to maximize the disruption of traffic flowing into the target area by optimally selecting target links using the link map and flow density.

   To quantify the impact of the chosen target-link set, the adversary computes the degradation ratio for the target area. The degradation ratio is the fraction of bot-target area routes cut by the attack over the total number of possible bot-target area routes. A route is considered cut if it contains a target link that is flooded by the attack.

   To select the target links that maximize the degradation ratio, the adversary must solve the generalized maximum coverage problem, which is NP-hard. Instead of finding an exact solution, the adversary uses an efficient heuristic, specifically a greedy algorithm [28], detailed in Section IV-D. The execution time of this heuristic is minimal, typically less than a minute in all experiments (refer to Section IV-D), enabling the adversary to adapt to dynamic route changes if necessary. The results show that flooding a few target links can block a majority of the connections to a target area. For example, flooding ten target links can cause an 89% degradation ratio for a small target area, while flooding fifteen target links can block 33% of connections to the West Coast of the US (refer to Section V-D).

### C. Bot Coordination

Once the target links are selected (Step B-â‘¡, Fig. 2), the adversary coordinates the individual bots to flood these links. To create the flooding flows, the adversary assigns to each bot (1) a list of decoy servers and (2) send-rates for packets destined to these servers. The send-rates are set such that individual attack flows have low intensity (or low bandwidth) while their aggregate bandwidth is sufficient to flood all target links. This step involves two sub-steps:

1. **Attack-Flow Assignment:**
   The goal of the attack-flow assignment is to make the aggregate traffic rate at each target link slightly higher than the link's bandwidth, thereby severely degrading all legitimate flows on those links. Two constraints must be met:
   - The per-flow rate must be low enough to avoid detection by network protection mechanisms in routers or intrusion detection systems (IDS).
   - The aggregate attack traffic necessary to flood all targeted links should be evenly distributed among multiple bots and decoy servers.

   The first constraint ensures that attack flows are indistinguishable from normal traffic, while the second addresses undetectability at both target and decoy servers (refer to Section VI for details). The adversary sets the maximum target bandwidth for each link and exhausts it with attack flows, then assigns individual flows for each target link. The per-flow rate is lower-bounded by the flow density, and the average per-flow rate for a target link should be higher than the target bandwidth divided by the maximum number of available attack flows, which is proportional to its flow density. The adversary also considers the maximum flow rate a decoy server can handle without triggering traffic alarms. For example, if a decoy server is a public web server, an average of one HTTP GET packet per second (approximately 4 Kbps) would not be classified as abnormal. Therefore, the adversary can assign a large number of attack flows with low per-flow rates. The per-bot and per-decoy server rates must be evenly distributed to enhance undetectability. The adversary conservatively sets the target bandwidth to 40 Gbps, which is the most widely used link bandwidth for high-bandwidth backbones (OC-768).

   Despite careful assignment, non-target links upstream of the target links could still become congested, a phenomenon we call early congestion, if they have limited bandwidth or if the bot density in a certain area is too high. The adversary can mitigate potential early congestion using a priori link bandwidth estimation, discussed in detail in Section IV-C.

2. **Target-Link Flooding:**
   The adversary directs the bots to start generating the attack flows. Each bot is responsible for multiple attack flows, each assigned to a distinct decoy server with the corresponding required send-rate. Bots gradually increase the send-rates of their attack flows to the assigned rates, making the attack flows indistinguishable from typical "flash crowds" [29]. Bots can dynamically adjust the intensity of their flow traffic based on the state of each target link. If the actual bandwidth of a target link is less than the assigned attack bandwidth (set in Section II-C1), the bots stop increasing the rates of attack flows once the target link is flooded.

### D. Rolling Attacks

The adversary can dynamically change the set of target links (among the multiple sets found previously) to extend the duration of the Crossfire attack indefinitely. Continuous flooding of the same set of target links would lead to bot-server route changes, activating the router's failure detection mechanism. By changing the set of target links, the adversary ensures attack persistence and keeps the attack purely at the data-plane level. The adversary can also dynamically change the set of bots to further enhance the undetectability of the Crossfire attack. These dynamic attack execution techniques, called rolling attacks, are described in more detail in Section IV-B.

### III. Technical Underpinnings

In this section, we discuss two key characteristics of the current Internet that enable the Crossfire attack: (1) the power-law distribution of flow-density, which is target-area specific, and (2) the independence of the geographical distribution of bots from target links and attack targets, providing the adversary with a wide choice of bots in different locations globally.

#### A. Characteristics of Flow-Density Distribution

Before analyzing the distribution of flow density, it is essential to distinguish between attack-specific flow density and connectivity-specific metrics, such as betweenness centrality [20] and the degree of routers [18, 19], which characterize the Internet topology. Flow density represents the number of source-to-destination (bot-to-server in the target area) pairs whose traffic crosses a link persistently. In contrast, betweenness centrality, which measures the number of shortest paths passing through an edge in a graph, does not reflect actual traffic flows and their dynamics. Similarly, the degree of a router, representing its layer-3 direct connections to neighbor routers, does not capture any traffic dynamics. Thus, neither of these metrics can be used to evaluate the feasibility of the Crossfire attack.

Our analysis of flow-density distribution is two-fold:
1. **Universal Power-Law Property of Flow-Density Distribution:**
   A power-law distribution exhibits a heavy-tail characteristic, indicating that extreme events are more likely to occur than in a Gaussian distribution. Formally, a quantity \( x \) obeys a power-law if it follows a probability distribution:
   \[
   p(x) \propto x^{-\alpha} \quad \text{for} \quad x > x_0,
   \]
   where \(\alpha\) is the scaling parameter [30]. The power-law property appears in the tail of the distribution (i.e., \( x > x_0 \)). If a power-law distribution holds for flow density, it implies that the adversary can easily find links with flow densities many orders of magnitude higher than average, making them good targets for a specific target area.

   We use the rigorous statistical test proposed by Clauset et al. [30] to show that a power-law holds for flow-density distributions. Figure 3 shows the flow-density distributions for two different target areas: (a) East Coast and (b) New York. The complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) (i.e., \( \Pr(X \geq x) \)) of the flow-density datasets is plotted on a log-log scale. Both distributions are well-fitted to the diagonal lines at the tail. The p-values for the two target areas (0.68 and 0.96) are much higher than the significance level (0.05), indicating that the null hypothesis (i.e., the flow-density distribution follows a power law) is accepted [33].

2. **Target-Area Dependency of Flow Density:**
   Unlike connectivity-related metrics, which depend only on physical network connectivity, flow density is an attack-specific metric. A target link with high flow density for one target area may have a very different density for other areas.

   Table I illustrates the top 20 links ordered by flow densities for three target areas of different sizes: the East Coast, Massachusetts, and Univ2. One would expect the links' flow densities to follow the link-map inclusion relations, but Table I shows that the top 20 links for these related target areas are very different. For example, link 19 has the highest flow-density rank when targeting Massachusetts but ranks next to last for the East Coast and does not even appear in the top 20 for Univ2. This clearly demonstrates that flow density is a target-area-specific metric, revealing a link's usefulness in an attack targeting a specific area.
