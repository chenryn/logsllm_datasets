What cause this high cpu load while the apache cpu load is fine? the mysql process is also fine.. the cpu load is still high even if I stop mail-http-mysql services!

Assistant: See Apache access/error log file. Without logs, it is difficult to say something.
If you have monitoring system(Cacti,Zabbix,...) see performance graphics.
Install nginx frontend
Check statistics(top,ps,iostat,vmstat,iotop)
Read system log file(/var/log/kernel.log,/var/log/syslog)
