#### Abstract
This presentation introduces a more potent variant of the Evil Twin attack, which we have named "Multipot." Unlike traditional Evil Twin attacks, Multipot is resistant to common defenses, particularly those based on deauthentication (deauth) for session containment. This threat can arise naturally in enterprise and campus networks or be deliberately set up by attackers. The presentation will conclude with a live demonstration of the Multipot threat, highlighting the complexities of evolving wireless vulnerabilities and their countermeasures [1,2].

#### Introduction to Multipot
**Definition:**
Multipot is a newly discovered threat scenario involving multiple Access Points (APs) configured with the same Service Set Identifier (SSID). These APs lure WiFi clients into connecting to them. The term "Multipot" is derived from "multiple" and "honeypot."

**Natural Occurrence:**
- **Municipal or Metro APs:** In environments where multiple municipal or metro APs are configured with the same SSID (e.g., GoogleWiFi), a client with this SSID in its WiFi profile can connect to any of these APs, forming a natural Multipot.
- **Corporate Networks:** Neighboring corporate networks with open or default SSIDs can also create a natural Multipot. Clients connecting to such networks may engage in non-policy-compliant communication.

**Malicious Use:**
- **Handcrafted Multipot:** An attacker can intentionally set up multiple APs with the same SSID and combine them with known Evil Twin attack tools (references 3-8). Each AP feeds data to a common endpoint (e.g., the attacker's computer), enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.

#### Ineffectiveness of Current Evil Twin Defenses
**Common Defenses:**
- **Client-Side Precautions:** Specialized software to prevent clients from connecting to Evil Twins.
- **Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS):** WIPS typically use deauth-based session containment to block connections to Evil Twins.

**Why They Fail Against Multipot:**
- When a WIPS attempts to deauthenticate a client connected to one AP in the Multipot, the client (including popular ones like Centrino) quickly switches to another AP in the Multipot, maintaining communication.
- The WIPS sensor has an inherent delay in detecting and deauthing the new connection, allowing the client to continue its session without major disruption.
- This creates a "cat and mouse" game, where the WIPS sensor is unable to effectively contain the session.

#### Live Demonstration
We will demonstrate the Multipot threat using two APs and a WIPS sensor that can deauth on one channel at a time. The demonstration will show that the victim client can maintain sustained ping and TCP connections through the Multipot, even in the presence of deauth-based session containment.

**Observations:**
- If the WIPS sensor can deauth on N channels simultaneously, a Multipot with N+1 APs can still render session containment ineffective.
- For a single WIPS sensor, N cannot be greater than 2, as otherwise, the sensor cannot continuously transmit sufficient deauths on any channel.
- Using soft APs, a Multipot can be implemented with virtually unlimited APs.

#### Countermeasures
To defend against Multipot, WIPS must perform session containment in a way that prevents the client from hopping to APs with similar SSIDs. One approach is to implement wireless session containment at Layer 3 and above, avoiding disturbances at Layer 2 that prompt the client to switch APs.
