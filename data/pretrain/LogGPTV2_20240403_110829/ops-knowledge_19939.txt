User: I am trying to make my python script executable without going through the terminal typing like
python test.py
I want to make it able to run when i click on the file.
How i going to do this in my fedora machine.
Assistant: Add #!/bin/python as the very first line of your file. Or, if you don't know where your python executable is, type which python in a terminal; then copy the result of that and put it after the #!.
Change the permissions of the file so that its executable chmod u+x test.py



i try but it still open back as gedit


Right click on the file in your gnome file browser or desktop.
Select Properties
Go to Open with and choose Python. If you don't see python in the list, add the command. Just type python in the command to be added.
