User: Please list at least 3 virtualization technologies, describe their characteristics, compare their advantages and disadvantages, and give application scenarios.
Assistant: 1. Container Virtualization Features: Based on operating system-level virtualization, applications and their dependent runtimes are packaged into an independent container, and resources such as the system kernel are shared with the host operating system. Compared with traditional virtual machine technology, container virtualization technology can achieve higher performance, faster start and stop time, and less resource occupation. Advantages: lightweight, efficient, easy to deploy and manage, cross-platform support Disadvantages: limited resource isolation capabilities, unable to support different operating systems, security needs attention Application scenarios: support for the deployment of microservice applications, rapid deployment of applications, agile Development and testing, CI/CD, etc. 2. Full Virtualization Technology (Full Virtualization) Features: The isolation between the virtual machine and the physical machine is completely realized. The operating system and applications in the virtual machine are transparent to the physical machine. There is no dependency between the physical machine and the physical machine, realizing the independence of the operating system. Advantages: Support the coexistence of multiple operating systems, good isolation, high security, and a wide range of applications Disadvantages: Since the entire hardware system needs to be simulated, it consumes resources; the startup time is long; IO scheduling between virtual machines is not as efficient as physical machines ; Application scenarios: enterprise-level applications, security systems, cloud computing 3. Hardware-assisted virtualization technology (Hardware-assisted Virtualization) Features: It uses the hardware virtualization support provided by the CPU to realize virtualization. That is, part of the virtualization work is handed over to the CPU hardware for processing. In this way, the loss between the virtual machine and the physical machine can be reduced, and the performance of the virtual machine can be improved. Advantages: Improve the performance and stability of virtual machines, improve security, and support the coexistence of multiple operating systems Disadvantages: High hardware requirements, older CPUs may not support; the number of virtual machines is limited Application scenarios: cloud computing, security systems, large enterprises level application.
