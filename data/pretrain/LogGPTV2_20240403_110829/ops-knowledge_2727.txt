User: I have been asked to choose a project for my Operating System course at my university. I was bubbled with the idea of making an Operating System from scratch in Python. 
I have a few limitations: 

I have only 3 months. 
I want to do it in Python. 
I can put in say 20-30 hours every week into it. 

I want to know, how feasible is the idea? Like how far can I go in building the same. I would be very happy, if I can get a basic version running (something with a handful of very basic apps running.) Is it possible with the given limitations?
Is there a book that can help me like a guideline? (need not be for python, I just need a guide to tell me how I should go about making the OS)
If the idea is not feasible, can anyone tell me how much do I need to scale down my idea? 
Any help is much appreciated!
Assistant: I don't get how you think you can write an operating system in Python. You need native code to at least load an interpreter during bootup, not to mention hardware communication, drivers etc., all of which would be nearly impossible to do given current Python interpreters when running on a bare machine. I'm also pondering if you are aware that you'd have to port a given Python interpreter to compile and run without an underlying operating system, which alone would keep you busy for a time.
It's good that you are ambitious, but I honestly think you could not even finish the basic operating system, let alone "some very basic apps running".
