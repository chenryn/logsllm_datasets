Warning: React attempted to reuse markup in a container but the checksum was
invalid. This generally means that you are using server rendering and the
markup generated on the server was not what the client was expecting. React
injected new markup to compensate which works but you have lost many of the
benefits of server rendering. Instead, figure out why the markup being
generated is different on the client or server:  
(client) tyle="did-flip:true;-webkit-tap-highligh  
(server) tyle="did-flip:true;tap-highlight-color:
