User: Can you shed some light on the interaction between the Python interpreter distributed with OS X and the one that can be installed through MacPorts?
While installing networkx and matplotlib I am having difficulties with the interaction of /usr/bin/python and /opt/local/bin/python2.7. (The latter is itself a soft pointer to /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7)
How can I be certain which Python, pip, and Python libraries I am using at any one time?
More importantly, it appears that installing matplotlib is not possible on Lion. It fails with Requires numpy 1.6 or later to build.  (Found 1.5.1). If I upgrade by running sudo pip install --upgrade numpy, it does not help. Subsequently attempting to install matplotlib (sudo /usr/local/bin/pip install matplotlib) still fails with the same (Requires numpy 1.6...) message. How can I install matplotlib?
Assistant: May I also suggest using Continuum Analytics "anaconda" distribution. One benefit in doing so would be that you won't then need to modify he standard OS X python environment.
