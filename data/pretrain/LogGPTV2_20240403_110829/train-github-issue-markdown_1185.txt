Hi, I'm using camera plugin to capture video. I changed multiple lines, but
the problem exists in the sample as well. I'm using an **Oneplus 2** (real
device) and the quality of the saved video is way to bad.  
I get 1MB for 10 seconds of video recording. The resolution is fine
(1080x1440) but i think the bitrate is not high enough.
Is there a way to change it?  
In the CameraPlugin there is this line:
`mediaRecorder.setVideoEncodingBitRate(1024 * 1000);`
Or am i the only person facing this problem?
Question 2: The recorded video has an aspect ratio of 0.75 ( according to the
resolution 1080x1440 ).  
Is there a way to make a portrait video (full height 16 / 9)).
Greetings Markus
