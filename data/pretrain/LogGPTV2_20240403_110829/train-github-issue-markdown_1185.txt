Subject: Issue with Video Quality and Aspect Ratio Using Camera Plugin

Dear Support Team,

I am currently using the camera plugin to capture video. Despite making several modifications, I have encountered a persistent problem with the quality of the saved video on my OnePlus 2 (real device). The video quality is significantly poor, as a 10-second video recording only results in a 1MB file. While the resolution (1080x1440) is acceptable, it appears that the bitrate may be too low.

In the `CameraPlugin` code, I noticed the following line:
```java
mediaRecorder.setVideoEncodingBitRate(1024 * 1000);
```
Is there a way to adjust the bitrate to improve the video quality? Additionally, am I the only one experiencing this issue?

Furthermore, the recorded video has an aspect ratio of 0.75 (based on the resolution 1080x1440). Is there a way to record the video in portrait mode with a 16:9 aspect ratio?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Markus
