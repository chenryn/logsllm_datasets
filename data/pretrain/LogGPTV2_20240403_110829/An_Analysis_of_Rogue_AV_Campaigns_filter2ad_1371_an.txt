Fig. 5. Latency against local-preference worm: from worm infection time to de-
tection time for local-preference scanning worm, measured as the number of worm
connections leaving the protected network prior to detection
the random worm. This is because the worm targets the local network so aggres-
sively that in many scenarios it infects multiple hosts inside the network before
it is detected. Recall that our latency metric measures the combined external
scanning of all infected hosts in the network. The TRW detector, on the other
hand, shows identical latency performance for all environments when comparing
random and local-preference worms because it detects the worm before it infects
multiple hosts (except in the wireless environment).
PGD behaves quite diﬀerently than the other detectors. It detects the local-
preference worm more quickly than the random worm in the enterprise and
campus environments, but slower in the department environment. And in the
wireless environment the local-preference worm is detected more quickly at scan-
ning rates of two scans per second or less, but the random worm is detected more
quickly at rates above two scans per second.
The DSC detector is the fastest, allowing fewer than 25 outgoing worm con-
nections in all scenarios where it was able to detect the worm 100% of the time.
TRW is also quite fast, allowing fewer than 27 connections in all environment
except for the wireless environment where it allows roughly 100. Note TRW
also is the most sensitive detector, successfully detecting the worm at the lowest
scanning rates in all environments.
6.4 Detector Performance against Topo Worms
Topo scanning changes the observed behavior of an infected host by reducing
the number of connection failures that the detector can observe. The neighbors
discovered by the topo worm are vulnerable at the same level as other hosts in the
network but are guaranteed to be present, diﬀerent from random scanning where
