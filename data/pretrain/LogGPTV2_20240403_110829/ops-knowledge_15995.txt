User: I am tryingt to set a connection to a live quad copter using a the Drone-Kit api from the python command line. (I am using Python 2.7. I am also using OS X Yosemite 10.10.5)



from dronekit import connect
vehicle = connect('/dev/cu.usbserial-DJ00DA30', wait_ready=True)



I get a message:



Link timeout, no heartbeat in last 5 seconds



In another 30 seconds, the command aborts. I know this is the correct device to use (cu.usbserial-DJ00DA30) because I am able to connect with it to the drone using APM Planner 2.0.
Any help please
Assistant: I was having the same issue yesterday and fixed it by installing the latest build from github. I'm on Windows 10 but in this case it should be irrelevant.
