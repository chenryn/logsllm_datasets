Title: Recovery for Sporadic Operations on Cloud Applications 
Other name/s: 
Faculty: Faculty of Engineering 
Abstract 350 words maximum: (PLEASE TYPE) 
Cloud-based  systems  get  changed  more  frequently  than  traditional  systems.  These  frequent  changes  involve  sporadic 
operations such as installation and upgrade. Sporadic operations on cloud manipulate cloud resources and they are prone to 
unpredictable  and  inevitable  failures  largely  due  to  cloud  uncertainty.  To  recover  from  failures  in  sporadic  operations  on 
cloud,  we  need  cloud  operational  recovery  strategies.  Existing  operational  recovery  methods  on  cloud  have  several 
drawbacks, such as poor generalizability of the exception handling mechanism and the coarse-grained recovery manner of 
rollback  mechanisms.  Hence,  this  thesis  proposes  a  novel  and  innovative  recovery  approach,  called  POD-Recovery,  for 
sporadic  operations  on  cloud.  One  novelty  of  POD-Recovery  is  that  it  is  based  on  eight  cloud  operational  recovery 
requirements  formulated  by  us  (e.g.  recovery  time  objective  satisfaction  and  recovery  generalizability).  Another  novelty  of 
POD-Recovery  is  that  it  is  non-intrusive  and  does  not  modify  the  code  which  implements  the  sporadic  operation.  POD-
Recovery works in the following innovative way: it first treats a sporadic operation as a process  which provides the workflow 
of the operation and the contextual information for each operational step. Then, it identifies the recovery points (where failure 
detection  and  recovery  should  be  performed)  inside  the  sporadic  operation,  determines  the  unified  resource  space  (the 
resource types required and manipulated by the sporadic operation), and generates the expected resource state templates 
(the abstraction level of resource states) for  all operational steps. For a given recovery point inside the sporadic operation, 
POD-Recovery  first  filters  the  applicable  recovery  patterns  from  the  eight  recovery  patterns  it  supports  and  then 
automatically generates the recovery actions for the applicable recovery patterns. Next, it evaluates the generated applicable 
recovery actions based on the metrics of Recovery Time, Recovery Cost and Recovery Impact. This quantitative evaluation 
leads  to  the  selection  of  an  acceptable  recovery  action  for  execution  for  a  given  recovery  point.  We  implement  POD-
Recovery  and  evaluate  it  by  recovering  from  faults  injected  into  five  representative  types  of  sporadic  operations  on  cloud. 
The  experimental  results  show  that POD-Recovery  is  able to  perform  operational  recovery  while satisfying  all  the  recovery 
requirements and it improves on the existing recovery methods for cloud operations.

Abstract 
Cloud-based  systems  get  changed  more  frequently  than  traditional  systems.  These  frequent 
changes  involve  sporadic  operations  such  as  installation  and  upgrade.  Sporadic  operations  on 
cloud  manipulate  cloud  resources  and  they  are  prone  to  unpredictable  and  inevitable  failures 
largely due to cloud uncertainty. To recover from  failures in sporadic operations on cloud, we 
need  cloud  operational  recovery  strategies.  Existing  operational  recovery  methods  on  cloud 
have several drawbacks, such as poor generalizability of the exception handling mechanism and 
the coarse-grained recovery manner of rollback mechanisms. Hence, this thesis proposes a novel 
and innovative recovery approach, called POD-Recovery, for sporadic operations on cloud. One 
novelty  of  POD-Recovery  is  that it is  based  on  eight cloud  operational  recovery  requirements 
formulated  by  us  (e.g.  recovery  time  objective  satisfaction  and  recovery  generalizability). 
Another  novelty  of  POD-Recovery  is  that  it  is  non-intrusive  and  does  not  modify  the  code 
which  implements  the  sporadic  operation.  POD-Recovery  works  in  the  following  innovative 
way:  it  first  treats  a  sporadic  operation  as  a  process  which  provides  the  workflow  of  the 
operation  and  the  contextual  information  for  each  operational  step.  Then,  it  identifies  the 
recovery points (where failure detection and recovery should be performed) inside the sporadic 
operation,  determines the  unified  resource space (the  resource types  required  and  manipulated 
by the sporadic operation), and generates the expected resource state templates (the abstraction 
level of resource states) for all operational steps. For a given recovery point inside the sporadic 
operation,  POD-Recovery  first filters the  applicable recovery  patterns from  the  eight  recovery 
patterns  it  supports  and  then  automatically  generates  the  recovery  actions  for  the  applicable 
recovery  patterns.  Next,  it  evaluates  the  generated  applicable  recovery  actions  based  on  the 
metrics  of  Recovery  Time,  Recovery  Cost  and  Recovery  Impact.  This  quantitative  evaluation 
leads to the selection of an acceptable recovery action for execution for a given recovery point. 
We  implement  POD-Recovery  and  evaluate  it  by  recovering  from  faults  injected  into  five 
representative types of sporadic operations on cloud. The experimental results show that POD-
Recovery is able to perform operational recovery while satisfying all the recovery requirements 
and it improves on the existing recovery methods for cloud operations.
