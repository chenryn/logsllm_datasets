User: Does anyone know how to associate the py extension with the python interpreter on Mac OS X 10.5.7? I have gotten as far as selecting the application with which to associate it (/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python), but the python executable appears as a non-selectable grayed-out item. Any ideas?
Assistant: The python.org OS X Python installers include an application called "Python Launcher.app" which does exactly what you want.  It gets installed into /Applications /Python n.n/ for n.n > 2.6 or /Applications/MacPython n.n/ for 2.5 and earlier.  In its preference panel, you can specify which Python executable to launch; it can be any command-line path, including the Apple-installed one at /usr/bin/python2.5. You will also need to ensure that .py is associated with "Python Launcher"; you can use the Finder's Get Info command to do that as described elsewhere. Be aware, though, that this could be a security risk if downloaded .py scripts are automatically launched by your browser(s). (Note, the Apple-supplied Python in 10.5 does not include "Python Launcher.app").
