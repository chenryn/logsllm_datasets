Subject: Potential Error in TypeScript Documentation - Dependency Injection Guide

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I believe there is an error in the TypeScript documentation, specifically in the "Developer Guides" section, under "6. Dependency Injection."

The current code snippet is:
```typescript
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/angular2';
```

It should be:
```typescript
import {Injectable} from 'angular2/core';
```

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
