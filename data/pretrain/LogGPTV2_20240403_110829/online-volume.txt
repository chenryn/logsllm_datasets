### Online Volume Command

The `online volume` command transitions a volume from an offline state to an online state. This command is applicable to volumes that have failed, are failing, or are in a failed redundancy state.

#### Important Notes
- **Volume Selection**: A volume must be selected for the `online volume` command to succeed. Use the `select volume` command to choose and focus on a specific volume.
- **Read-Only Disks**: The `online volume` command will fail if it is used on a read-only disk.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
online volume [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **noerr** (Optional): 
  - **Description**: For scripting purposes. When an error occurs, DiskPart continues to process subsequent commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Examples
To bring the currently focused volume online, use the following command:
```plaintext
online volume
```

This command will transition the selected volume to an online state, provided it meets the necessary conditions.
