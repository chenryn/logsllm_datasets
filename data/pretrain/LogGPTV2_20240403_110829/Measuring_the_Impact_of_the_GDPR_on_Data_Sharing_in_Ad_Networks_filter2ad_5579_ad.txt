5.2 Connections of Third Parties
To get a better understanding of the described effects on the track-
ing ecosystem, we analyze the structure of the measured third-party
graphs. We look at the degree of each node and classify them based
on the number of direct and indirect partners. Primary partners are
those where a direct syncing relation was observed while secondary
partners are those with a higher degree of separation. We classified
third parties (nodes) into three categories: (1) nodes with predomi-
nately direct (primary) partners, (2) nodes with only one partner
but a large number of secondary partners, and (3) nodes with a
rather balanced amount of primary and secondary partners. We
labeled a node “central” if it has four times more primary partners
than secondary partners, “outer” if it has four times more secondary
partners than primary partners, and “balanced” otherwise. Our data
set contains 21 central nodes and 30 balanced nodes. The remaining
nodes in the graph are end nodes in a star.
The majority networks of cooperating third parties are arranged
in star topologies. They have one central point with many primary
syncing connections to partners (e. g., Google), but these partners
rarely sync with additional partners. Other nodes with many sec-
ondary partners have few primary partners (often just 1), who are
the central point of a star. Thus, these companies are connected
to all outer nodes of the star as secondary partners. Nodes with a
balanced amount of primary and secondary partners do not have
any other special characteristics.
We also analyzed the effects of the mean betweenness centrality
between the pre-GDPR measurement and the post-GDPR measure-
ments. The betweenness centrality is an index to measure how
many shortest paths in a graph include a node. The higher the
betweenness centrality of a node, the higher the amount of infor-
mation that flows through this node. For example, a central node
in a star topology would have a high betweenness centrality index,
because it is the center of the star, while the outer nodes would have
a betweenness centrality index of zero (they are only the start/end
of the shortest path but never have multiple edges). In contrast
to the degree of a node, the betweenness centrality can been seen
as factor measuring the links between two star typologies. Hence,
a high betweenness centrality score shows that a node connects
different syncing communities (i. e., serves as a “bridge”). We com-
puted the betweenness centrality index using the NetworkX Python
package [23].
Similar to our syncing connection regression, we performed a
linear regression of the mean betweenness centrality and found
a statistically significant (α = 0.01 with p-value < .001) decrease
in the betweenness centrality. In extreme cases, the betweenness
centrality dropped by up to 60 % (mean 30 % SD: 11 %). An overview
of the betweenness centrality properties of our measured graphs
is given in Table 6 where all graphs have a median and minimum
betweenness centrality of zero. We used the 75 % quantile of the
betweenness centrality of all nodes observed in M#1, 5.87, as a
reference value to illustrate the change of betweenness centrality
over time.
In line with the findings that the amount of syncing connections
decreases, the mean/max betweenness centrality also decreases.
Furthermore, the amount of well-connected nodes (b/c ≥ 5.87 in
our case) and connected nodes decreases which also means that
fewer nodes sync IDs with each other.
The result of fewer companies participating in the ID sharing
has different effects on the importance of different nodes—in terms
of sharing connections and the information flowing through the
nodes. The betweenness centrality of the most important node,
Google, decreases by around 36 % while other nodes actually gain
(e. g., Oracle (71 %) or MediaMath (24 %)) in betweenness centrality.
However, in absolute numbers Google is still the dominant node in
our graph. Overall, 43 companies gained betweenness centrality,
78 lost betweenness centrality (≤ 50 %), and the betweenness cen-
trality of 31 companies was decreased significantly by more than
50 %. These numbers only include companies that were observed in
M#1 and at least two other EU measurements. The nodes gaining
betweenness centrality are mostly small companies with initially
low betweenness centrality scores of less than 5.87 (37).
Regarding the classification of a node, we found that, due to the
star-like topologies, that “central” nodes have high betweenness
centrality scores and “outer” nodes have low (or zero) betweenness
centrality scores. In our scenario, the betweenness centrality can
be seen as a metric how prevalent a company is in the syncing
ecosystem. Thus, these companies are connected to all outer cor-
ners of the star as secondary partners. However, we did not see a
paradigm change how companies sync user IDs. Overall, the degree
distribution in our measured graphs did not vary a lot between all
graphs (see Appendix A), but the total amount of links dropped by
23 %.
These observations are in line with the results of our previous ob-
servations that the general structure (or business practices) within
the ecosystem did not change after the GDPR became effective,
but we have shown that ID syncing dropped significantly. Over
the course of our study, we observed that the number of primary
partners of most companies continuously decreased by up to 40 %
(83 less primary partners). Five companies became isolated and only
two companies gained primary partners. With respect to secondary
connections, we see a fluctuation of partners. This can be explained
by the fact that adding one primary partner, who might be the
center of another star, can lead to a significant number of additional
secondary partners (sometimes hundreds of secondary partners).
Our results also show that embedding one third party into a
website puts users at risk that their data gets shared with hundreds
of companies. This leads to the problem that users cannot verify
who received a copy of their data, which leads to the question
how service providers can ensure that data is deleted upon request.
Previous work conducted prior to the GDPR has found that an ID is
synced with 3.5 partners on average [38]. Our measurements have
shown that the average amount of ID syncing partners might not
be a good metric to assess ID syncing due to the star-like topology,
rather an in depth graph analysis is necessary. Aside from the
one dominating star, with Google as a central point, we observe
many smaller networks that share IDs with each other. This is in
line with our observation of the communities in the graph (see
Table 4) and public announcements of companies to build tracking
infrastructures besides Google or Facebook [35].
5.3 Case Studies
Only 70 companies were observed in all 11 measurements. Most of
those are prominent companies that offer multiple services (e. g.,
Google or Oracle). A summary of these companies and how they
evolved over time is given in Appendix B. We found 20 companies
(approx. 3 %) that had shared data before May 28, 2018 and were
not observed in any of the consecutive EU measurements, but still
appeared in our US measurements. Manual inspection of these
services showed that some had announced they were discontinuing
business in the European Union or changed their business model.
For example, one website stated: “Currently, XX does not provide any
services in the European Economic Area (EEA), service will be resumed
once we feel that we are able to comply with the GDPR criteria.”. Two
other companies notified their customers that they were required

to adopt a technology based on consent management platforms2
(CMP): “But please keep in mind, if you do not comply with GDPR, then
XXX (and many other ad tech partners) will not be able to monetize
any of your EU traffic.” Since our data collection setup did not
automatically give consent, these companies are likely compliant
with the new standards and stopped sharing data without consent.
Aother company announced in early 2018 that it was refocusing
its business towards contextual advertising, where ads are based
on the content of a website and not the profile of the user visiting
the website. However, for the majority of companies, we did not
find GDPR-related information, but it is possible that they quietly
retreated from the European market, without publicly explaining
that their services cannot be made compliant.
Overall, our data shows that companies share data with a smaller
number of partners that they did in early 2018 which is in line
with other studies that have shown that the reach of smaller com-
panies has decreased, while tracking by the market leaders has
increased [22]. An alternative explanation for our results is that
companies changed how they exchange IDs. Our measurement ap-
proach (see Section 4) relies on ID syncing that can be observed on
the client side. Therefore, it is possible that a shift towards server-
side ID syncing is taking place that cannot be studied with current
methods. Previous work found that Google is one of the beneficia-
ries of the GDPR, as the number of websites that embed one of
their services [22] increased. Regarding the amount of information
flowing through nodes, in terms of ID sharing, we cannot confirm
these findings. According to our measurements, Google and others,
lost importance in that regard while other nodes, especially Oracle,
gained importance. However, in total Google is still the leading
