User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Should password reset tokens be hashed when stored in a database? Passwords are hashed so that if someone gains access to a database of passwords then they won't know what the actual passwords are and so they can't log in.

If I can get a valid password reset token however (the kind which would be emailed to a user when they've forgotten their password) then isn't this as good as a password?

I could take a token, plug it into the reset page and set the password to whatever I want and now I have access.

Thus shouldn't password reset tokens also be hashed in the database?

Assistant: Yes, you should hash password reset tokens, exactly for the reasons you mentioned. 

But no, it's not quite as bad as unhashed passwords, because 


reset tokens expire and not every user has an active one
users notice when their passwords are changed, but not when their passwords are cracked, and can thus take steps to limit the damage (change password and other sensitive data, etc). 


Additionally, as users reuse passwords, an attacker can try a cracked passwords for other accounts, such as the users email, thus increasing the damage.
