User: I'm running a python script using python3 myscript.py on Ubuntu 16.04. Is the script loaded into memory or read and interpreted line by line from the hdd? If it's not loaded all at once, is there any way of knowing or controlling how big the chunks are, that are loaded into Memory?
Assistant: The "script" you use is only the human friendly representation you see. Python opens that script, reads lines, tokenizes them, creates a parse and ast tree for it and then emits bytecode which you can see using the dis module. 
The "script" isn't loaded, it's code object (the object that contains the instructions generated for it) is. There's no direct way to affect that process. I have never heard of a script being so big that you need to read it in chunks, I'd be surprised if you accomplished it.
