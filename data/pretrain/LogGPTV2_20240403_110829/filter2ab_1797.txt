### ATT&CK Technique Details

- **ATT&CK ID**: T1578.002
- **Technique Name**: Create Cloud Instance

**Description**:
An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine (VM) within the compute service of a cloud account to evade security defenses. By creating a new instance, the adversary can potentially bypass existing firewall rules and permissions that are applied to other instances in the same account.

The process typically involves the following steps:
1. **Snapshot Creation**: The adversary creates a snapshot of one or more volumes in the cloud account.
2. **Instance Creation**: A new instance is created using the cloud provider's compute service.
3. **Volume Mounting**: The snapshots are mounted to the newly created instance.
4. **Policy Modification**: The adversary applies less restrictive security policies to the new instance, allowing for easier data collection from the local system or for remote data staging.

This technique enables the adversary to operate in a more permissive environment, facilitating unauthorized data access and exfiltration.
