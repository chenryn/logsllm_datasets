7. Test of the BIMM Certificate Mapping 
Mallory  knows  that  the  web  application  has  several 
options that are restricted to PPC users.  So Mallory targets 
the  PPC’s  vice  president  of  research  and  development 
(R&D).    He  creates  a  certificate  that  looks  like  the  vice 
president of R&D’s certificate and retrieves the requested 
information for SRPC management.  How was Mallory able 
to complete this feat? 
Victor’s  CA  product  is  a  product  that  did  not support 
cross-certification.  Without this ability to cross-certify with 
the  PPC  or  SRPC  CAs,  Mallory  realized  that  he  could 
create a subordinate CA that looked like PPC’s CA. 
  Now that Mallory had a look-alike PPC CA, he decided 
to  create  a  certificate  of  PPC’s  vice  president  of  R&D.   
Mallory  had  a  copy  of  the  vice  president’s  authentic 
certificate  and  decided  to  copy  the  attributes  into  the

8. Trent’s Analysis of Mallory’s Attack 
  Several  months  later,  PPC  noticed  that  SRPC  had 
offered  a  new  product  line  that  was  similar  to  PPC 
prototypes. 
  BIMM  initially  thought  Bob  must  have 
divulged  sensitive  information  since  the  web  application 
log  files  showed  that  he  had  made  several  accesses  from 
unscrupulous  locations.    Unfortunately,  Victor’s  log  files 
were  very  similar  to  the  Common  Logfile  Format  and 
therefore  the  only 
identity  data  collected  was  IPs  and 
usernames—no  certificate  information.    Trent  was  sent  to 
the BIMM Corporation to investigate.  Trent visited Victor 
and explained the situation.  Victor went on to explain the 
design of the web application. 
  After  listening  to  Victor,  Trent  told  Victor  how  he 
believes Mallory may have compromised Victor’s security 
measures.  The basic problem uncovered by Trent was the 
following: 
1.  The path validation module checked to see if the 
client certificate chained to a trusted root.  None of 
the  root  CAs  had  imposed  constraints  on  what 
names could appear in their respective certificate 
paths.

the  web 
application

unrestricted  values  contained  in  the  attributes  of

accounts to certificates, its design is similar to that

Trent  informed  Victor  that  since  there  was  no  cross 
certification by Victor’s CA with PPC or SRPC, then both 
were  able  to  imitate  one  another  because  of  the  lack  of 
name  constraints.      Trent  demonstrated  this  capability  by 
creating a fake subordinate SRPC CA.  
9. Possible Solutions 
name 
constraints, 
In  order  to  solve  the  problem,  Trent  and  Victor  knew 
that they had to bind certificates using a restricted naming 
convention for any given CA.  There are  three possibilities: 
cross-certification  with 
attribute 
certificates, or name constraints and other policies applied 
by the web application or policy engine. 
9.1 Cross-certification and Name Constraints 
  Cross-certification is the process by which a CA issues a 
cross-certificate  to  another  CA.    Essentially,  the  cross-
certificate  contains  the  public  key  of  a  CA,  which  is 
associated with the private key for that CA.  The purpose of 
cross-certification  is  to  allow  users  in  one  domain  to 
communicate  securely  in  another.    For  example,  BIMM 
could  issue  a  cross-certificate  to  PPC,  thereby  allowing 
Bob’s certificate validation path to end with the BIMM CA 
certificate instead of the PPC CA certificate. [1] 
“The  X.509  name  constraint  model  allows  any 
certification  authority  to  specify,  when  it  certifies another 
certification  authority,  exactly  what  names  are  allowed  in 
subsequent certificates in the certification path.” [2] Name 
constraints  can  be  applied  to  various  attributes  such  as 
uniform resource indicators (URI), Internet mail addresses, 
domain  name system (DNS) names, directory names, and 
Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. [5] 
  Victor  believes 
that  cross-certification  and  name 
constraints  are  a  potential  technical  solution,  but  not  a 
viable solution in his case because of the reasons listed in 
[9].

9.2 Binding Identity Certificates to Attribute 
  Certificates 
Victor had toyed around with the idea of using attribute 
certificates,  but  once  again,  cost  was  a  factor  and  the 
BIMM  Corporation  did  not  want  to  manage  another 
authority.  In addition, a tight binding between the attribute 
certificate  and  the  identity  certificate  would  need  to  be 
established,  e.g.,  hash  of  the  public  key  or  certificate.    In 
order  to  get  the  value,  Victor  would  have  to  collect 
certificates,  and  therefore  this  was  not  an  acceptable 
solution.    He  decided  to  use  the  Internet  mail  address, 
organizational unit, and organization attributes as a binder 
between a certificate and a user account.  He believed that 
he  could  constrain 
the  name 
constraint concepts in [5].  He decided not to use userids 
because  it  would  make  it  difficult  to  enforce  uniqueness 
across CAs.

9.3 Application Enforced Name Constraints and  
Policies – A Moderate Coupling 
limit 
  Victor modified his web application so that it enforces 
its  own  form  of  name  constraints  and  path 
length 
constraints  for  each  CA.    He  wanted  to  keep  his  solution

organizational  masquerading,  then  it  could  apply  its  own 
name  constraint  in  accordance  with  [5].  He  decided  to 
apply  permittedSubtrees 
to  organizational  CAs  and 
commercial CAs in the web application as well. 
If  a  given  CA  had  concerns  about 
the  scope  of  any 
The  permittedSubtrees  he  chose  to  apply  were  the 
Internet  mail  address  and  directoryName.  [5]  Using  this 
simple definition, Victor constructed a constraint table as in 
Table 2.

  The  application  name  constraint  policy  basically  states 
that each organizational CA can only have its organization 
name in certificates.  Ultra Trust CA can have a limited set 
of  organizational  names  (Walker  Inc.,  Big  Cars).    Victor 
could  have  used  excludedSubtrees  for  Ultra  Trust  so  that 
PPC and SRPC do not appear in certificates, but any other 
name could.  In addition, Internet mail addresses are limited 
to  the  respective  domains  (.ppc.com),  host  (ppc.com),  or 
specific mailbox (PI:EMAIL). 
  Victor  also  included  the  ability  to  apply  path  length 
constraints.  This ability was added so that he could limit 
chain lengths for CAs where he knew he did not need to 
accept subordinate CAs; however, for those root level CAs 
where any given user could have access to the application, 
restrictions on names was the overriding factor. 
10. Conclusion 
  Many  organizations  are  looking  at  the  possibility  of 
using  certificates  as  authorization  objects. 
  When 
environments exist where there are multiple CAs involved, 
careful  consideration  should  be  given  to  answering  the 
question “How should this CA be trusted?”  If the answer is 
for  a  limited  purpose(s),  then  the  application  should  take 
into  consideration  that  purpose(s).    If  traditional  path 
validation cannot resolve the issue of how the CA will be 
limited  to  that  purpose(s),  then  the  application  should 
address  the  restrictions  required.    This  must  be  weighed 
against the risk.  Adding any external policy will increase 
cost  and  overhead.    It  may  be  determined  that  the  risk  is 
cheaper than the solution.
