### Viewing Hidden System Files in Ubuntu

By default, Ubuntu hides system files to prevent accidental manipulation. However, there may be instances where you need to view these files within the Files application. The following steps will allow you to see all files on the system, and this change will persist across reboots.

### Sharing Folders Between Host and VM

We have configured our virtual machine (VM) to include a shared folder on the Desktop. This feature facilitates the transfer of files between the VM and the host. It can be particularly useful for copying evidence from the VM to your host for preservation on external media. However, I have encountered limitations with this method, especially when dealing with large files or a high volume of data. For instance, attempting to copy hundreds of large video files often results in errors. This issue is more pronounced in VirtualBox compared to VMware. A more reliable solution is to transfer evidence directly to a USB drive within the VM. If you prefer, you can use this method and eliminate the shared folder altogether.

### Understanding the Benefits of an OSINT Virtual Machine

You should now have a clear understanding of the benefits of using an Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) virtual machine. Next, we will discuss the maintenance and preservation of your work. We are close to finalizing the settings for all future investigations.

### Chapter 5: VM Maintenance & Preservation

#### Introduction

This chapter is my favorite, so let's get started. First, I want to ensure that you have a clean environment. I do not expect you to start over from the beginning of the book, but I do ask that you repeat the steps with a new VM. Consider the previous chapters as your education, and now we will generate a new, clean environment.

#### Steps to Create a New VM

1. **Open VirtualBox** and delete any previous VMs created from this book (if desired).
2. Click on the "New" button.
3. Provide a name for the VM, e.g., "OSINT Original".
4. Choose your desired location to save the machine on your host.
5. Select "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu 64-bit" as the version, then click "Continue".
6. In the memory size window, allocate 50% of your system memory.
7. Click "Continue", then "Create".
8. Leave the hard disk file type as "VDI" and click "Continue".
9. Select "Dynamically allocated" and click "Continue".
10. Choose the desired size of your virtual hard drive (40GB+) and click "Create".

#### Configuring the VM

1. **Settings**:
   - Click the "Settings" icon, then the "Storage" icon.
   - Click the CD icon which displays "Empty" in the left menu.
   - Click the small blue circle to the far right in the "Optical Drive" option.
   - Select "Choose a Disk File" and choose the Ubuntu ISO previously downloaded.
   - Click "Open" or "Choose" if prompted, then click "OK".
   - Confirm the Ubuntu ISO if prompted.

2. **Starting the Installation**:
   - Click "Start" in the main menu and click "Start" again if prompted.
   - Increase screen size by clicking "View", "Virtual Screen", and "Scale" if needed.
   - Select "Install Ubuntu".
   - Choose your desired language and location, then click "Continue".
   - Select "Normal Installation", "Download Updates", and "Install third party", then click "Continue".
   - Select "Erase disk and install Ubuntu", then "Install Now". Confirm with "Continue".
   - Choose your desired time zone and click "Continue".
   - Enter a name, username, computer name, and password of "osint" for each.
   - Select "Log in automatically".
   - Allow Ubuntu to complete the installation, click "Restart Now", then press "Enter".
   - Upon first boot, click "Skip" then "Next".
   - Select "No" and then "Next" when asked to help improve Ubuntu.
   - Click "Next" then "Done" to remove the welcome screen.
   - If prompted to install updates, click "Remind me later".
   - Power off the virtual machine.

#### Creating a Snapshot or Clone

This is a good time to create a snapshot or clone of this machine. This allows you to return to a pristine standard Ubuntu installation without any applications or customizations. I maintain a clone titled "Ubuntu Install" for this purpose.

#### Installing Guest Additions

1. Restart the "OSINT Original" VM.
2. In the VirtualBox Menu, select Devices > "Insert Guest Additions CD Image".
3. Click "Run" when the dialogue box pops up, provide your password when prompted, then "Authenticate".
4. Once the process is complete, press enter, and power off the VM (upper right menu).

#### Adjusting Settings

1. In VirtualBox, select your VM and click "Settings".
2. In the "General" icon, click on the "Advanced" tab.
3. Change "Shared clipboard" and "Drag n Drop" to "Bidirectional".
4. In the "Display" icon, change the Video Memory to the maximum.
5. In the "Shared Folders" icon, click the green "+".
6. Click the dropdown menu under "Folder Path".
7. Select "Other".
8. Choose a desired folder on your host to share data and click "Open".
9. Select the "Auto-mount" option and then "OK".
10. Click "OK" to close the settings window.

#### Terminal Commands

1. Open Terminal and execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo adduser osint vboxsf
   sudo apt purge -y apport
   sudo apt remove -y popularity-contest
   sudo apt update
   ```

#### Basic VM Tools

1. Restart the "OSINT Original" VM, then launch and close Firefox.
2. Click the Applications Menu, launch Terminal, and execute the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo snap install vlc
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
   sudo apt install -y python3-pip
   sudo -H pip install youtube-dl
   sudo -H pip install yt-dlp

   curl -u osint9:bookl43wt -o https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/vm-files.zip
   unzip vm-files.zip -d ~/Desktop/
   mkdir ~/Documents/scripts
   mkdir ~/Documents/icons
   cd ~/Desktop/vm-files/scripts
   cp * ~/Documents/scripts
   cd ~/Desktop/vm-files/icons
   cp * ~/Documents/icons
   ```

#### Advanced VM Tools

1. Execute the following commands to install advanced tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y build-essential dkms gcc make perl
   sudo rcvboxadd setup
   ```

2. Restart your Ubuntu VM and resize the window if desired.
3. Eject the CD from the left Dock.
4. Launch Settings from the Applications Menu and disable notifications, screen lock, and other unnecessary features.
5. Update the system and install additional software as needed.

### Conclusion

You now have a secure, customized Linux VM with several Linux applications and shortcuts to easily launch each with user prompts for data. You can begin online investigations, but I recommend deleting everything and starting over to ensure a clean environment. The entire list of steps is available on my website at [https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/linux.txt](https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/linux.txt). Use the username "osint9" and password "bookl43wt" if required for access. These steps will be updated as necessary on the website.
