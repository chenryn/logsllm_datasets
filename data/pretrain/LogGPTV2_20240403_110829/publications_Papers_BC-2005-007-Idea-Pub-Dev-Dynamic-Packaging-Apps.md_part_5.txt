### Ontology Development and Dynamic Packaging Applications

#### Ontology Construction and Features
The ontology development tool under consideration offers several key advantages:
1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: It supports multiple operating systems, including AIX, Solaris, Linux, and Windows.
2. **OWL Support**: It allows the construction of ontologies using OWL (Web Ontology Language).
3. **Strong Community Support**: It is backed by a robust community of developers, including academics, government entities, and biomedicine professionals.
4. **Open Source**: The tool is free and open source.

#### Methodology for Tourism Ontology Development
Tourism is a data-rich domain with information scattered across numerous data sources. Our e-tourism ontologies aim to provide a structured way of viewing and organizing tourism-related information and concepts. These ontologies will facilitate integration and interoperability through a shared vocabulary and consistent meanings for terms. 

**Current Status**:
- This is an ongoing project, and our tourism ontologies are not yet complete.
- We are continuously gathering new concepts for the taxonomies and developing new axioms.

**Key Questions Addressed**:
Our ontologies are designed to answer three main questions (Figure 10) relevant to dynamic package development for tourists:
- **What**: What can a tourist see, visit, and do at a tourism destination?
- **Where**: Where are the interesting places to see and visit located?
- **When**: When can the tourist visit a particular place? This includes the day of the week, hours of the day, and atmospheric conditions (e.g., some activities cannot be undertaken if it is raining).

**Steps in Building the Ontologies**:
1. **Concept Definition**: We have created unique and explicit definitions for tourism-related concepts such as nightlife, sightseeing, relaxation, and shopping.
2. **Root Node Selection**: A root node concept was chosen to encompass a variety of tourism-relevant concepts.
3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Concepts were organized into classes and subclasses, forming a hierarchical tree. For example, nightlife, sightseeing, relaxation, and shopping are subclasses of the concept "activity."
4. **Disjointness and Relations**: Explicit information about the disjointedness of classes and relations like inverse and transitivity were identified. For instance, the sightseeing concept is disjoint from the shopping concept.
5. **Background Knowledge**: Domain-relevant properties were added to each concept. For example, a tourism organization has a telephone number, fax number, address, and email.

#### Implementation Using Protégé
In the early stages of our project, we used the Protégé editor to implement the ontologies. This was a time-consuming process, as it required gathering detailed information about real tourism activities and infrastructures from the web and integrating them into the knowledge base.

**Main Components of the Tourism Ontologies**:
- **Concepts**: Represent sets or classes of entities within the tourism domain. Examples include Activity, Organization, Weather, and Time.
- **Relations**: Describe interactions between concepts or their properties.
- **Instances**: Specific elements of a class. For example, Cloudy, Showers, and Scattered Showers are instances of the class WeatherCondition.
- **Axioms**: Constrain the values for classes and instances, providing logical information about their characteristics.

**Example of Concept Representation**:
- **Activity**: Refers to sports (e.g., skiing) and other activities (e.g., shopping, visiting a theatre).
- **Organization**: Refers to places where tourists can carry out activities (e.g., restaurants, cinemas, museums).
- **Time and Weather**: Refer to the time and weather conditions that allow tourists to engage in activities at specific places.

**Associative Relationships**:
- For example, the relationship "hasActivity" links the class "Organization" with the class "Activity," indicating that an organization can provide activities like hiking and surfing.

#### Creating Dynamic Packages
Dynamic packages are generated by a dynamic packaging engine, which is part of a larger architecture that includes a rule editor, rule repository, and rule engine (Figure 12).

**Configuration Activities**:
- **Rule Development**: The rule designer uses the rule editor to define packaging rules. The rule editor provides a graphical user interface for creating and modifying rules, which are then stored in a central repository.
- **Packaging Rules**: Logic statements that describe policies and procedures for creating dynamic packages. These rules are stored externally, making them easier to manage and modify compared to hard-coded rules.

**Benefits of Using a Rule Engine**:
- **Flexibility**: Allows changes to be made to reflect new business policies.
- **Customization**: Enables the creation of new travel products, services, and promotions.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time needed for changing rules and increases profit by responding quickly to market demands.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Improves customization of travel products and services according to customer preferences.

#### Formal Specification of Packaging Rules
Packaging rules can be expressed using formal languages such as UML, ILOG, BRML, and RuleML. We chose RuleML due to its ability to specify queries and inferences on ontologies and mappings between ontologies.

**Examples of RuleML Usage**:
- **Simple Example**: "Renting an AVIS car, class B, costs thirty euros per day."
- **Complex Example**: "A customer is premium if he has spent a minimum of 5,000 euros on a travel package."

**Advantages of RuleML**:
- **Independence**: Rules are independent of the inference engine used, allowing for easy exchange between different engines.
- **Translation**: Before execution, rules are translated into the language of the inference engine, such as Jess, LISP, or Prolog.

This comprehensive approach ensures that our dynamic packaging applications are flexible, efficient, and highly customizable, meeting the needs of both the travel industry and its customers.
