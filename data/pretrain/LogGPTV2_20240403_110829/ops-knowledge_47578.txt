User: How to optimize database performance to improve application responsiveness? Please provide specific optimization strategies and techniques.
Assistant: 1. Build an index: The function of the index is to speed up the query, which can improve the query speed when searching for a column in the table. Slow queries can also result if inappropriate indexes are used in the query. Therefore, the type, number, and location of indexes must be considered to build the correct indexes to improve performance. 2. Loading data: Reasonable loading of data can greatly improve query speed. This can be achieved by limiting the number of columns returned, shrinking the number of returned records, using caching, and sorting on the server side. 3. Optimize query statements: Using efficient query statements can significantly improve performance. Wildcards and long, complex queries should be avoided, as well as subqueries and aggregate queries. 4. Vertical partitioning: Decomposing a large table into multiple small tables can improve query speed. Columns that are not frequently used can be separated and separate tables can be created, which can reduce the cost of data access to a certain extent. 5. Horizontal sharding: Distributing data to different machines according to rules can reduce the burden on a single server, thereby improving the performance of the entire system. 6. Compress data: Compressing data can reduce disk space usage, reduce data read and write time, and improve performance. For example, use the Zip or Gzip algorithm to compress backup data, or use the LZ77 algorithm to compress log data. 7. Table partition: divide the table into multiple partitions according to the rules, which can reduce the locking limit and make the query faster. Partitioning can be done based on data range, partition method, or other metrics. 8. Redundant database: maintain the same copy of data in different locations, and when a failure occurs in one location, it can be quickly switched to another location, thereby avoiding data loss and reducing the risk of server overload. 9. Database cache: cache frequently used data in memory to speed up queries. This can be achieved using a cache, a proxy cache, or a custom implementation cache. 10. Optimize the network: Improve network performance by upgrading network bandwidth, optimizing IO operations, rationally using modules and adapters, and making full use of network connection pools.
