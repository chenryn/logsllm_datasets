Based on our quantiﬁcation, the percentage of successfully
de-anonymized users by any (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA scheme is
at least 1 − ϵ. Given ℘ varied from .3 to .95, we evaluate
the minimum number of users in the 26 datasets considered
that can be successfully de-anonymized with probability 1
in terms of our quantiﬁcation, i.e., the lower bound of 1 − ϵ,
(Ω(1 − ϵ)), and the results are shown in Tab. 3. From Tab.
3, we make some important observations and comments as
follows.
(i) When ℘ increases, more users can be de-anonymized
for every dataset as expected. For example, when ℘ = .5,
it is a.a.s.
at least 29.7% of the users in Google+ can
be successfully de-aonymized; when ℘ is increased to .8,
at least 72.5% of the users in Google+ can be successful-
ly de-anonymized; when ℘ = .95 all the users in Google+
can a.a.s. be successfully de-anonymized. From Tab. 3,
similar DA phenomena applied to all the datasets, which is
consistent with our quantiﬁcation. The reason is straight-
forward. When ℘ increases, more edges appear in both Ga
and Gu. Thus, the structural similarity between Ga and
Gu is increased followed by more users can statistically be
successfully de-anonymized.
(ii) Most of the existing structural datasets are a.a.s. de-
anonymizable completely or at least partially just based on
the topological information. For instance, Facebook and
Orkut datasets can be completely de-anonymized when ℘ =
.8. Even when a dataset cannot be completely de-anonymized,
it may be de-anonymizable partially in a large-scale. For ex-
ample, when ℘ = .9, at least 60.9%, 48.9%, and 85.7% of
the users in LiveJournal, Gowalla, and AstroPh can be suc-
cessfully de-anonymized, respectively. This fact is consistent
with our quantiﬁcation as well as the intuition that structure
itself can be used to de-anonymize data.
(iii) An interesting observation is that the DA results on
two datasets with similar graph densities may be very d-
iﬀerent in practice. From Tab. 2, for two datasets with
similar graph densities, e.g., Google+ and Skitter, the the-
oretical bounds on (Ω(fD), Ω(n)) for perfect DA are also
similar. However, from Tab. 3, the DA results of Google+
and Skitter are very diﬀerent: when ℘ = .6, the number of
de-anonymizable users in Google+ (41.8%) is about twice
that of in Skitter (23.1%); while when ℘ = .95, all the
users in Google+ are a.a.s. de-anonymizable while the de-
anonymizable users in Skitter is only bounded by Ω(59.1%).
To study the reason for this fact, we need to consider the de-
gree distribution of Google+ and Skitter besides the graph
density (as well as Ω(fD) and Ω(n)). From Tab. 1, the per-
centage of low degree users in Skitter is much higher than
that in Google+. On the other hand, intuitively, low de-
gree users, especially users with degree of 1, do not have too
much distinguishable structural information (this intuition
is conﬁrmed by our theoretical quantiﬁcation on diﬀeren-
t DEs caused by mismatching high degree users and low
degree users), which implies that they are diﬃcult to be de-
anonymized based on structural information. Consequently,

the existence of a large amount of low degree users in Skit-
ter makes it less de-anonymizable than Google+, which is
consistent with our quantiﬁcation. In summary, from Tabs.
1 and 3, if a dataset has a high average degree and a small
percentage of low degree users, it is easier to de-anonymize
and a large amount of its users are a.a.s. de-anonymizable;
otherwise, for datasets with a low average degree and a
large percentage of low degree users, they are diﬃcult to
de-anonymize based solely on structural information.
(iv) Following the above observation, we ﬁnd that there
exists some diﬀerences between theory and practice on the
dominating factor of DA. Theoretically, the graph densi-
ty plays a dominating factor on determining the bound of
(Ω(fD), Ω(n)). In practice, the degree distribution and the
average degree have more impact on the DA results. This is
mainly because we study the quantiﬁcation from an asymp-
totical sense in the theoretical scenario (i.e., n → ∞) and
the key parameter pi,j asymptotically converges to graph
density ρ, i.e., E(pi,j) ≃
n → ∞ ρ. On the other hand, when
quantifying the percentage of de-anonymizable users for each
dataset, the actual degree sequence/distribution D is used
to examine when the DA conditions are satisﬁed.
We also evaluate the impact of ℘ and ϵ on the bound of
Ω(n) in (1 − ϵ)-perfect DA (we do not show Ω(fD) since
it depends on ℘ and exhibits the same behavior as in the
perfect DA) as shown in Tab. 4. From Tab. 4, we have the
following observations.
(i) When ϵ is ﬁxed, the impact of ℘ on Ω(n) in (1 − ϵ)-
perfect DA is similar to that in perfect DA, i.e., when ℘
increases, Ω(n) decreases. The reason is also the same as
before since a large ℘ implies more similarity between Ga
and Gu and thus a loose condition on Ω(n) is suﬃcient to
enable σk (k ≤ ϵn) to induce less DE than σk′ (k
> ϵn).
′
(ii) When ℘ is ﬁxed, Ω(n) is also decreasing with the in-
crease of ϵ. For instance, when ℘ = 0.6, Ω(n) decreases
from 2.2E7 to 9.5E6 for Google+ when ϵ increases from .1
to .4. This is because of that when ϵ increases, more DE is
tolerated, and thus loose condition is required for Ω(n) to
