Currently, any container runtime has to be linked into the kubelet. This makes
experimentation difficult, and prevents users from landing an alternate
container runtime without landing code in core kubernetes.
To facilitate experimentation and to enable user choice, we should add a
client/server implementation of the container runtime interface.
This implementation will simply encode the requests, send them to a server
where they will be decoded and sent into an instance of the container runtime
interface.
However, this enables container runtime implementations to be built and
maintained outside of the core kubernetes tree.
