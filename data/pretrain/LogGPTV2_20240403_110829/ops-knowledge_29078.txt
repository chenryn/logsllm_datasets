User: Or any other normal scripting language for that matter. I know there is VBScript and JScript. But I don't really like those for any kind of computing.
I would really love to have python or ruby (or perl) interpreter installed with windows by default so when I write small console applications I wouldn't need to distribute whole python installation with it via py2exe(or similar).
Do you know if there is such incentive? Do you think this would be possible? Or it's not acceptable for Microsoft?
Assistant: Because Windows doesn't need those languages to run, by default ?
(While, for instance, many basic Linux utilities depend on some script-languages, like Perl)
I would add that JScript and VBScript have been implemted by Microsoft -- so Microsoft can distribute their implementation ; on the other hand, there is no Microsoft implementation of either Python, PHP, or Perl, ...
