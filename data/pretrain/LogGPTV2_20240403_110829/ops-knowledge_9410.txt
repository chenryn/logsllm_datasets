Assistant: This system log chunk is tracking multiple attempts from IP addresses 187.141.143.180 and 185.190.58.151 to access the system. The first attempt was from IP address 187.141.143.180, which attempted to log in as root and failed. The second attempt was from IP address 185.190.58.151, which attempted to log in as user "api" and failed. The third and fourth attempts were from IP address 187.141.143.180, again attempting to log in as root and failing both times.
