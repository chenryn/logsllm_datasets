needed to evaluate these channels under larger amount of noise both
indoor and outdoors.
5.4 Light Channel Design and Experiments
To evaluate the ambient light channel, we explored the effect of
signals sent through two light sources: (1) overhead lighting, and (2)
different types of computer and TV screens located near the phone.
This captures the attacks whereby the triggers are sent via power
ﬂuctuations, or via TV/IP-TV programs. Figure 5 in the appendix
shows a snapshot of our experimental set-up.
For this channel, we assumed that the mobile phone will be placed
on top of a table. As mentioned earlier, we designed our malware
application as a background service in this case. We note that the
typical ambient light inside a room during daytime is between 120
and 240 lux units. At night, with a ﬂuorescent light, the ambient
light is about 120 lux units.
Overhead Lighting Tests: When placed on top of a desk, a mobile
phone is usually about 6 feet away from the ceiling, which is where
the light sources are commonly located. To simulate this scenario
for the overhead light channel tests, the phone was placed ﬂat on
the desk in a ofﬁce room, with the display facing up (the ambient
light sensors of most smart phones are located at the top of their
displays). Figure 1(a) depicts this set-up. We manually introduced
small ﬂuctuations in the light intensity of the overhead lights inside
the room. Our experiments in this setting showed that by tweaking
the light source, we were able to change the light intensity from 120
lux to 160 lux as detected by the phone’s ambient light sensor. In
this setting, we were able to send the trigger message to the phone
successfully with 0% bit errors at a data rate of 0.5 bits per second.
Computer and TV Screen Tests: Next, we examined the feasibil-
ity of a signal being sent via a video played on a computer monitor
or a TV. Figure 1(b) shows our experimental setup for this set of
tests. Here, we varied the tilt angle between the phone and the desk,
and measured the maximum range with 0% bit errors. The trigger
signal was displayed on the monitor. To encode the messages, we
programmatically increased and decreased the brightness of the
screen.
The total amount of light emitted by a monitor depends on the
size of the monitor. For our tests, we used a 17 inch laptop display, a

22 inch desktop LCD display, and a 48 inch LCD television. In case
of the laptop and the TV, we performed the experiments at night
with the overhead lights turned on, providing bright ambient light
in the room. In case of the desktop screen, we performed the tests
during the day (i.e., in presence of natural light) with a few overhead
lights on.
Table 2 depicts the results we obtained when using the laptop
screen. The angle between the phone and the surface was varied
from 90 degree to 45 degree. We were able to sustain a bit rate of
0.5 bits/second at a distance of 65 inches or 5.5 feet with 0% bit loss
when the phone is parallel to the laptop screen. As the tilt angle is
lowered w.r.t. the desk surface, the range decreases. In summary,
we achieved reasonable range even with a small screen monitor.
Table 3 shows the results of our tests when the desktop monitor
was used. The results in this case are similar to the previous test
with the laptop monitor.

We found the best results (longest range) in the case of the 48
inch LCD TV. Results from our TV experiment are shown in Table 4.
Even with the phone placed ﬂat on a desk, we received the trigger
message with 0% bit errors at a distance of 13 inches from the
TV. We were even able to receive the signal at a distance of 100
inches (8.33 feet) when the phone was parallel to the TV screen.
This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our light channel
for sending triggers via TV broadcasts. Note that the normal TV
viewing distances [6] are inline with the range we obtained based
on our experiments.
5.5 Magnetic Channel Design and Experiments
For the magnetic-ﬁeld channel, we built a programmatically con-
trolled electro-magnet to encode the messages. At the receiving end,
we retrieved the readings of the magnetic sensor of the phone via
an application. The magnetometer built into the phone is a 3-axis
vector magnetometer and thus provides the X, Y, Z components of
the magnetic ﬁeld relative to the spatial orientation of the phone, as
shown in Figure 2. Choosing only one component of the magnetic
ﬁeld would require the device to be held in a particular orientation.
Instead, a scalar value makes use of all three component values and
allows the device to be in any orientation. We can simply derive this
scalar value by using the formula for vector-to-scalar conversion:
z , where x, y, z denote the X, Y, Z
scalar = (cid:112)m2
x + m2
y + m2
components of the magnetic ﬁeld, respectively.
We ﬁrst calculated the background magnetic ﬁeld due to the
Earth’s magnetic core. We turned on the magnetic sensor on the
phone and recorded the scalar values to measure the ambient mag-
netic ﬁeld strength at various locations in the absence of a strong
magnetic source in order to determine this baseline. The values
we obtained fall within the range of 30 to 50 microtesla, which
Figure 2: The reference axes across the phone
conforms to the fact that the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld at the equator is
31 microtesla.
Next, we set out to test two different scenarios. First, when the
(electro-)magnet is not covered, and second, when the magnet is
covered by clothing, plastic and other material. This was done
to study any potential effect on the magnetic ﬁeld strength due to
hiding the magnet on a door frame. For each scenario, we varied
the orientation of the magnet with respect to the phone. A snapshot
from our experiments is shown in Figure 5(a) in the appendix.
Figure 3(a) shows the various distances, between the phone and
the magnet, at which the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld can be
detected. Notice that the magnetic ﬁeld can be detected best when
the magnet is oriented perpendicular to the front face of the phone
(i.e., along the Z axis). In that orientation, we could detect the
magnetic ﬁeld at a maximum distance of 5 inches. However, at this
distance, the magnetic ﬁeld is not strong enough to send the trigger
signal without bit errors. The ﬁeld strength in this case hovers
around the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, and ﬂuctuates quite a bit.
Figure 3(b) depicts the maximum distances at which we were
able to send a signal consistently without any bit errors. We were
able to send a signal to the malware application at a maximum
distance of 3.5 inches. At this distance, the magnetometer in the
phone was able to detect a magnetic ﬁeld of 60 microtesla from the
electro-magnet, which is high enough to distinguish itself from the
background/natural magnetic ﬁeld.
We next repeated the above experiment by covering the electro-
magnet with plastic. As depicted in Figures 3(c) and 3(d), the
magnetic ﬁeld is, however, virtually unchanged even in this case.
These results conﬁrm that the magnetic channel is feasible in
many scenarios where the magnet can be placed close to the phone
without worrying about shielding effects.
5.6 Power Consumption
Finally, we investigated the power consumption of the sensors.
We tested the power consumption by keeping the sensors running
constantly for 10 minutes. We found that, in practice, sensors
use a small amount of power. For example, the magnetometer,
accelerometer, and light sensors cause virtually no change in battery
consumption. Even the microphone consumed less than 1% of the
battery capacity over regular consumption rate during a 10 minute
period. Further details of sensor power usage can be found in
Table 5.
The power consumption analysis shows that the malware appli-
cation, even when accessing the sensors, does not cause signiﬁcant
power drain in practice. We point out that only the steganographic

audio channel requires potentially expensive Fast Frequency Trans-
form (FFT). The other channels do not use FFT. And while FFT does
require computation resources, prior research shows it is feasible to
reduce energy consumption [7]. Optimizations can parallelize FFT
computation on ARM processors which are widely used in smart-
phones [35]. Another mechanism for evading power drain analysis
is that, the attacker may send triggers only at certain times(e.g.,
once-a-day during telecast of a TV program where the trigger signal
has been embedded). This signiﬁcantly reduces likelihood of detec-
tion while still giving the attacker a periodic trigger window.

6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Summary of Results and Further Analysis
Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of sending command
and control trigger messages to smart phones and similar devices
over out-of-band covert channels.
Range: The direct audio channel exhibited the longest range – more
than 55 feet indoors, 45 feet outdoors. It can also tolerate real-life
background noise. We were able to achieve these communication
ranges using only low-end PC speakers with minimal ampliﬁcation
and low-volume. In practice, we envision the audio channel to use
better quality speakers or sound systems present in Televisions or
other multimedia systems. The direct audio channel also has the
advantage of working both indoors and outdoors. Our experiments
also demonstrated that the audio reception works even if the phone
will be kept in the user’s pocket or a purse. However, we do not
expect it to work when the phone is stowed inside leather pouches
or inside other thick material. Therefore, our experiments provide
evidence that the audio based command and control via TV or
radio programs, background music services, Internet TV program
and musical greeting cards is feasible. This is also true for our
steganographic channels, although our current experiments with
these channels were conducted in a typical ofﬁce setting.
The ambient light channel has shorter range compared to the
audio. However, it has the advantage of sending a trigger message
simultaneously to all the phones in a targeted building. The light
channel works best at night or in places with low illumination. Dur-
ing daytime, the presence of sunlight introduces a large amount of
ambient light (a form of background noise), due to which receiving
the messages over long distances might be difﬁcult. However, when
using large screen televisions, the messages can be relayed over
reasonably long distances.
The magnetic channel, as expected, has the shortest range. This
is due to the inherent property of magnetism – magnetic signals
rapidly fade as they travel in the air. However, even this short range
channel can be surreptitiously exploited in scenarios where the
signal transmitter is hidden in the doorframe or on an elevator. The
magnetic channel clearly would work in most, if not all, scenarios
irrespective of the way the phones are stowed or carried by users.
Channel Bandwidth: A limitation of the sensor-based channels
is their low-bandwidth. In our current implementation, we were
able to achieve a maximum bandwidth of 5 bits per second with
these channels. This limit is attributed to a number of different
factors such as the limited sensitivity of mobile device sensors,
the low sampling rate enforced by the Android OS and the need
for undetectability of transmission. However, since command and
