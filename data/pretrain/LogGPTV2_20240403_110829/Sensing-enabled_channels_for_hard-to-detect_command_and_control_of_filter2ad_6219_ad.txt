### 5.4 Light Channel Design and Experiments

To evaluate the ambient light channel, we investigated the effects of signals transmitted through two types of light sources: (1) overhead lighting, and (2) different types of computer and TV screens located near the phone. This setup simulates scenarios where triggers are sent via power fluctuations or through TV/IP-TV programs. A snapshot of our experimental setup is provided in Figure 5 in the appendix.

For this channel, we assumed that the mobile phone would be placed on a table. As previously mentioned, our malware application was designed to run as a background service. We noted that typical indoor ambient light levels during the daytime range from 120 to 240 lux units. At night, with fluorescent lighting, the ambient light level is approximately 120 lux units.

#### Overhead Lighting Tests

In a typical office setting, a mobile phone placed on a desk is usually about 6 feet away from the ceiling, where the light sources are commonly located. To simulate this, we placed the phone flat on the desk with the display facing up (since the ambient light sensors of most smartphones are located at the top of their displays). Figure 1(a) illustrates this setup. We manually introduced small fluctuations in the light intensity of the overhead lights. Our experiments showed that by tweaking the light source, we could change the light intensity from 120 lux to 160 lux, as detected by the phone’s ambient light sensor. In this setting, we successfully sent the trigger message to the phone with 0% bit errors at a data rate of 0.5 bits per second.

#### Computer and TV Screen Tests

Next, we examined the feasibility of sending signals via a video played on a computer monitor or a TV. Figure 1(b) shows our experimental setup for these tests. We varied the tilt angle between the phone and the desk and measured the maximum range with 0% bit errors. The trigger signal was displayed on the monitor, and we programmatically increased and decreased the screen brightness to encode the messages.

The total amount of light emitted by a monitor depends on its size. For our tests, we used a 17-inch laptop display, a 22-inch desktop LCD display, and a 48-inch LCD television. For the laptop and TV, we conducted the experiments at night with the overhead lights turned on, providing bright ambient light in the room. For the desktop screen, we performed the tests during the day with some overhead lights on.

Table 2 summarizes the results obtained using the laptop screen. The angle between the phone and the surface was varied from 90 degrees to 45 degrees. We achieved a bit rate of 0.5 bits/second at a distance of 65 inches (5.5 feet) with 0% bit loss when the phone was parallel to the laptop screen. As the tilt angle decreased, the range also decreased. Overall, we achieved reasonable range even with a small screen monitor.

Table 3 shows the results of our tests using the 22-inch desktop monitor, which were similar to those with the laptop monitor.

We found the best results (longest range) with the 48-inch LCD TV. Table 4 presents the results from our TV experiment. Even with the phone placed flat on a desk, we received the trigger message with 0% bit errors at a distance of 13 inches from the TV. We were able to receive the signal at a distance of 100 inches (8.33 feet) when the phone was parallel to the TV screen. This clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our light channel for sending triggers via TV broadcasts. Note that the normal TV viewing distances [6] align with the range we obtained based on our experiments.

### 5.5 Magnetic Channel Design and Experiments

For the magnetic-field channel, we built a programmatically controlled electromagnet to encode the messages. At the receiving end, we retrieved the readings of the phone’s magnetic sensor via an application. The magnetometer in the phone is a 3-axis vector magnetometer, providing the X, Y, and Z components of the magnetic field relative to the phone's orientation, as shown in Figure 2. Using a scalar value derived from all three components allows the device to be in any orientation. This scalar value can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{scalar} = \sqrt{m_x^2 + m_y^2 + m_z^2}
\]

where \(m_x\), \(m_y\), and \(m_z\) denote the X, Y, and Z components of the magnetic field, respectively.

First, we calculated the background magnetic field due to Earth’s magnetic core. We recorded the scalar values to measure the ambient magnetic field strength at various locations in the absence of a strong magnetic source. The values we obtained fell within the range of 30 to 50 microtesla, which aligns with the fact that Earth’s magnetic field at the equator is 31 microtesla.

Next, we tested two scenarios: (1) when the electromagnet was not covered, and (2) when the electromagnet was covered by clothing, plastic, and other materials. This was done to study the potential effect on the magnetic field strength due to hiding the magnet on a door frame. For each scenario, we varied the orientation of the magnet with respect to the phone. A snapshot from our experiments is shown in Figure 5(a) in the appendix.

Figure 3(a) shows the various distances at which the presence of the magnetic field can be detected. The magnetic field is best detected when the magnet is oriented perpendicular to the front face of the phone (i.e., along the Z axis). In this orientation, we could detect the magnetic field at a maximum distance of 5 inches. However, at this distance, the magnetic field is not strong enough to send the trigger signal without bit errors. The field strength in this case hovers around the Earth’s magnetic field and fluctuates quite a bit.

Figure 3(b) depicts the maximum distances at which we were able to send a signal consistently without any bit errors. We were able to send a signal to the malware application at a maximum distance of 3.5 inches. At this distance, the magnetometer in the phone detected a magnetic field of 60 microtesla from the electromagnet, which is high enough to distinguish it from the background/natural magnetic field.

We repeated the above experiment by covering the electromagnet with plastic. As depicted in Figures 3(c) and 3(d), the magnetic field remained virtually unchanged. These results confirm that the magnetic channel is feasible in many scenarios where the magnet can be placed close to the phone without worrying about shielding effects.

### 5.6 Power Consumption

Finally, we investigated the power consumption of the sensors. We tested the power consumption by keeping the sensors running constantly for 10 minutes. We found that, in practice, sensors use a small amount of power. For example, the magnetometer, accelerometer, and light sensors cause virtually no change in battery consumption. Even the microphone consumed less than 1% of the battery capacity over regular consumption rate during a 10-minute period. Further details of sensor power usage can be found in Table 5.

The power consumption analysis shows that the malware application, even when accessing the sensors, does not cause significant power drain in practice. We point out that only the steganographic audio channel requires potentially expensive Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The other channels do not use FFT. While FFT does require computation resources, prior research shows it is feasible to reduce energy consumption [7]. Optimizations can parallelize FFT computation on ARM processors, which are widely used in smartphones [35]. Another mechanism for evading power drain analysis is to send triggers only at certain times (e.g., once-a-day during the telecast of a TV program where the trigger signal has been embedded). This significantly reduces the likelihood of detection while still giving the attacker a periodic trigger window.

| Sensor                | Power consumption in 10 minutes (% of battery capacity) |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| No sensor             | < 1                                                    |
| Microphone            | 2                                                      |
| Light sensor          | 1                                                      |
| Magnetometer          | < 1                                                    |
| Accelerometer         | < 1                                                    |

### 6. Discussion

#### 6.1 Summary of Results and Further Analysis

Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of sending command and control trigger messages to smartphones and similar devices over out-of-band covert channels.

**Range:**
- The direct audio channel exhibited the longest range, more than 55 feet indoors and 45 feet outdoors. It can also tolerate real-life background noise. We achieved these communication ranges using low-end PC speakers with minimal amplification and low volume. In practice, better quality speakers or sound systems in televisions or other multimedia systems could be used. The direct audio channel works both indoors and outdoors and can function even if the phone is kept in the user’s pocket or purse, though not inside thick materials like leather pouches.
- The ambient light channel has a shorter range compared to the audio channel but can simultaneously send a trigger message to all phones in a targeted building. It works best at night or in low-illumination areas. During the daytime, the presence of sunlight introduces significant background noise, making long-distance reception difficult. However, large-screen televisions can relay messages over reasonably long distances.
- The magnetic channel, as expected, has the shortest range due to the rapid fading of magnetic signals in the air. However, even this short-range channel can be exploited in scenarios where the signal transmitter is hidden in a doorframe or elevator. The magnetic channel works in most scenarios, regardless of how the phones are carried or stored.

**Channel Bandwidth:**
- A limitation of the sensor-based channels is their low bandwidth. In our current implementation, we achieved a maximum bandwidth of 5 bits per second. This limit is attributed to factors such as the limited sensitivity of mobile device sensors, the low sampling rate enforced by the Android OS, and the need for undetectability of transmission. However, since command and control messages typically require low bandwidth, this limitation is not a significant issue.
