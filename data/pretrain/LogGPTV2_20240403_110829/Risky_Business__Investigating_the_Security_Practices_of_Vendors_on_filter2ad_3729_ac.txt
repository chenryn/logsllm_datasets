days. Of the products they sold, 98% are drugs. The Drug
Lords (n = 110) do not differ much in terms of experience in
comparison to Drug Dealers, but have extreme amounts of
physical sales and more activity on other markets. All sales
(100%) are drugs related.
The following two clusters of vendors thrive in digital
sales rather than physical sales. First, Digital Fraudsters
(n = 103) have varying experience in selling fraud-related
items. Yet, all vendors in this cluster have at least 15 sales in
the digital domain and about 75% made more than 100 digital
sales. Some vendors with mainly digital sales, also made a
handful of physical sales. Second, Cybercrime Elites (n =
23). This small cluster of very successful vendors of digital
items clearly trumps the Digital Fraudsters in terms of
sales and are the most experienced groups of vendors on the
market.
5 Security practices
Following our discovery of distinct vendor types, we can now
investigate how each of them handle their security. In this
section we ﬁrst deﬁne how we capture security practices iden-
tiﬁed earlier. Then, we apply these measurements on the data
and elaborate on the security practices for each vendor type.
For the purpose of clarity, Table 3 provides an overview of
the six security practices, earlier work identifying these, our
measurement and data sources leveraged.
5.1 Measuring security practices
We capture the six security practices identiﬁed in Section 2
as follows.
Password strength. The strength of a vendor’s password
is captured by evaluating the estimated amount of guesses it
will take to crack the password. zxcvbn [63] is a password
strength estimation tool that outputs the estimated number of
guesses, given a plaintext password. The zxcvbn tool recog-
nizes common words and matches different types of patterns,
such as repeated letters, word reversal, common substitutes of
letters and keyboard sequences. The order of magnitude of the
amount of estimated guesses it will take to brute force a pass-
word indicates password strength. When zxcvbn estimates
that more than 1010 guesses are needed to crack a password,
the password is considered ‘very unguessable’, < 108 equals
‘somewhat guessable’ and < 106 is ‘very guessable’ [67].
Only the passwords of the vendors that logged into the
market during the last month it was operational are available.
In total, we analyzed the passwords of 1,081 vendors
(≈ 62.4%) 3. We ﬁnd that on average, the password strength
is 1014.7 estimated guesses, the median password strength is
1010.5 guesses.
Password uniqueness. We capture the uniqueness of users’
passwords by matching the SHA-1 hashes of the available
Hansa passwords with the SHA-1 hashes from the HIBP
password database. Out of the 1,081 vendors of whom a
password is available, 185 vendors (17.1%) logged in with a
password that we matched in the HIBP database. Given the
high security risks of using a non-unique password – i.e.,
access to user account(s) and potentially de-anonymization –
this number is larger than we initially expected.
2FA usage. The data table that stores the user administra-
tion, includes a binary variable that indicates whether 2FA
is enabled or not. Information on 2FA-usage is available
for all vendors (n = 1,733). Of the total vendor population,
only 60.5% (n = 1,049) protected their accounts with this
additional layer of security.
PGP usage. Hansa vendors could publish their public PGP-
key on their proﬁle. From this key, we extract the creation date
and the key-length using a Python implementation of GNU
Privacy Guard (GnuPG). Some keys had peculiar lengths of
1023-, 2047- or 4095-bits. Such aberrant key sizes are the
result of how RSA keys of length N are generated. Because
N is generated by multiplying two randomly chosen primes
p· q of length N/2, a small probability exists that a key of
N − 1 is generated. Although not mandatory as per the RSA
speciﬁcation [41], some implementations of RSA correct for
3Note, like we stated in Section 3.2, we did not perform this analysis
ourselves as we did not have any access to PII. To capture password strength,
we asked law enforcement to run zxcvbn on the available plaintext passwords
and return the output. We link this output to the unique ID’s that were used
to replace usernames, as this prevents us from analyzing any PII.

this. The atypical keys are – in practice – equally secure to
their more common counterparts, so we replace all uncommon
key lengths with the commonly found key lengths.
The PGP-adoption among vendors is high. Only 5 vendors
do not have a PGP-key listed. It could be, that these vendors
removed their PGP keys from their accounts after they
stopped trading. Weak keys (≤ 1024 bits) are observed for
only 9 vendors. Even by 2015’s standards, such key lengths
are considered not to be sufﬁcient [32]. We investigate the
relation between the extracted creation date of the key and its
key strength. No trend is apparent in which younger keys are
stronger than older keys.
PGP-key reuse. To capture which Hansa vendors explicitly
chose to use different PGP-keys on the markets they operate
on, we focus on a subset of the Hansa data. We only consider
the vendors that imported their reputation – of these vendors,
we can be sure that they operated on more than one market.
This method decreases the likelihood of including imposter
accounts in our analysis. Using this subset, we investigate
which PGP-keys are also listed in the database of the Grams
darknet market search engine. If we match a PGP-key in both
data sets, we check if – according to Grams – the PGP-key
links to other markets than Hansa. If we ﬁnd no match, or
a match that links only to a Hansa account, we infer that a
vendor explicitly chose to create new PGP-key(s) for its other
account(s). A match that links to a non-Hansa account, shows
us that this vendor reuses its key on at least one other market.
Figure 4 displays how the following groups overlap:
vendors with a PGP-key listed (n = 1,728), vendors known
to be active on other markets (n = 908) and PGP-keys that
are listed on any other market than Hansa in the Grams
search engine (n = 902). From this ﬁgure, we conclude that
there is a group of vendors (n = 265) who are active on
other market(s), but whose PGP-keys could not be matched.
Surprisingly, there is also a group (n = 259) who did not use
the import functionality but whose PGP-keys are matched in
the Grams data.

Traceability of cash-out. Using the Chainalysis blockchain
analysis service, we capture the traceability of vendors’ cash-
outs. Speciﬁcally, we analyze which vendors transact their
proﬁts directly to mainstream bitcoin exchanges or hosted
wallets – i.e., entities that can be subjected to subpoenas for
information on their users. A vendor that transacts proﬁts
made by doing business on an online anonymous market di-
rectly to an exchange or hosted wallet, creates an indisputable
transactional link between – most likely – criminal activities
and PII collected by subpoenable entities. Thus, this practice
is very insecure.
We analyze the 19,238 unique bitcoin payout addresses that
are stored in the Hansa back-end database. Of these, 2,680
addresses (≈ 14%) could be directly attributed to clusters
of addresses that Chainalysis identiﬁes with known service
wallets, such as central exchanges, peer-to-peer exchanges and
bitcoin mixers. Thus, the majority of the bitcoin addresses that
vendors cash-out to, are unknown services. We expect that
most vendors (ﬁrst) have their payouts transacted to private
(hardware) wallets or to mixing services that are not identiﬁed
by Chainalysis.
We visualize the known services vendors directly cash
out to in Figure 5. Exchanges that are reluctant in gathering
data on its users, or those that do not perform any identity
checks, are not likely to respond adequately to law enforce-
ment subpoenas. Chainalysis labels such exchanges as ‘high
risk exchanges’ (Figure 5). Next to this type of exchange,
cybercriminals regard peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges as safe-
havens due to minimal identity veriﬁcation 4.
5.2 Security practices across vendor types
As we have an overview of the prevalence of poor security
practices in the total vendor population, we now analyze

the security practices across each vendor type. Because we
face large differences in sample sizes – for example, 988
vendors are identiﬁed as Novices, while there are only 23
Cybercrime Elites – we perform extensive statistical test-
ing. This ensures that the differences we observe are not a
mere artefact of differences in sample size.
For each security practice, we ﬁrst perform an omnibus-test
to ﬁnd out whether there are any differences between vendor
types at all. If there are, we perform a post-hoc test. This test
speciﬁes which vendor types signiﬁcantly differ from each
other on security practices. Omnibus tests are more powerful
compared to pairwise post-hoc tests. It is plausible that an
omnibus test gives a signiﬁcant result, while all pairwise
post-hoc tests do not. Vice-versa, this is not the case.
Password strength. A password is not available for every
vendor. Still, all vendor types remain well populated: we
perform our analysis on 493 Novices (-50.1%), 394 Drug
Dealers (-22.6%), 93 Drug Lords (-15.5%), 78 Digital
Fraudsters (-24.3%) and all Cybercrime Elites (n = 23).
We show the distribution of password strength per vendor
type in Figure 6. A Kruskal-Wallis H test (p < 0.0001)
indicates that there are signiﬁcant differences in password
strength between vendor types.
To learn which vendor types differ signiﬁcantly in password
strength, we perform a Dunn post-hoc test in which the signif-
icance levels are adjusted for multiple comparisons through
FDR-BH adjustment [11]. With α = 0.05, we ﬁnd that only
three pairs of vendor types differ signiﬁcantly in password
strength, so we interpret the results with care (Figure 6). We
conclude that the password strengths of Drug Lords and
Drug Dealers differ signiﬁcantly with those of Digital
Fraudsters and that there is a signiﬁcant difference between
Drug Dealers and Novices. Regarding the difference be-
tween Drug Lords and Novices, there is slightly more sta-
tistical uncertainty (p = 0.0691).
We take into consideration that simpler passwords might
be used by those vendors that enabled 2FA. Generally, this
does not seem to be the case. 2FA-usage correlates positively

with password strength, as assessed by a Spearman rank-order
correlation (rs = 0.219, p < 0.0001). This indicates that
vendors do not tend to compensate relatively poor passwords
with the additional layer of security that 2FA adds.
Password uniqueness.
In Table 4 we show the amount
of vendors that made use of a unique password per vendor
type. Since there are signiﬁcant differences between vendor
types, as conﬁrmed by a χ2-test (p = 0.0064), certain types
of vendors make this security mistake more often than
others. To ﬁnd out how vendor types relate to each other
in terms of password uniqueness, we performed a pairwise
post-hoc z-test of proportions with FDR-BH correction (Table
4). It is evident that, again, the security practices of Drug
Lords and Drug Dealers are better than those of Digital
Fraudsters. The Novices perform relatively poor as well,
although only the difference with Drug Lords is signiﬁ-
cant. While Cybercrime Elites score quite high, their
score does not differ signiﬁcantly from the other vendor types.
2FA usage. With respect to 2FA-usage, vast differences
exist between vendor types (Table 4). We see that, again,
Drug Lords and Drug Dealers chose this secure option
the most often, whereas Digital Fraudsters go for
