### Vendor Clusters and Their Characteristics

- **Drug Dealers (n = 110)**: 
  - 98% of their sales are drugs.
  - Similar experience levels to Drug Lords but with lower physical sales and less activity on other markets.

- **Drug Lords (n = 110)**:
  - High volume of physical sales and more activity on other markets.
  - All sales (100%) are drug-related.

- **Digital Fraudsters (n = 103)**:
  - Varying experience in selling fraud-related items.
  - At least 15 digital sales per vendor, with about 75% making over 100 digital sales.
  - Some vendors also made a few physical sales.

- **Cybercrime Elites (n = 23)**:
  - Very successful vendors of digital items.
  - Highest sales and most experienced group on the market.

### 5. Security Practices

Following the identification of distinct vendor types, we now investigate how each type handles security. This section defines the methods for capturing security practices, applies these measurements to the data, and elaborates on the security practices for each vendor type. For clarity, Table 3 provides an overview of the six security practices, earlier work identifying these, our measurement, and data sources leveraged.

#### 5.1 Measuring Security Practices

We capture the six security practices identified in Section 2 as follows:

- **Password Strength**:
  - Evaluated using zxcvbn [63], which estimates the number of guesses required to crack a password.
  - Passwords with >10^10 guesses are considered 'very unguessable', <10^8 are 'somewhat guessable', and <10^6 are 'very guessable' [67].
  - Analyzed 1,081 vendors (≈ 62.4%), with an average password strength of 10^14.7 estimated guesses and a median of 10^10.5 guesses.

- **Password Uniqueness**:
  - Matched SHA-1 hashes of Hansa passwords with those in the HIBP database.
  - 185 out of 1,081 vendors (17.1%) used non-unique passwords, higher than expected due to the high security risks.

- **2FA Usage**:
  - Binary variable in the user administration table indicates 2FA status.
  - 60.5% (n = 1,049) of vendors used 2FA, providing an additional layer of security.

- **PGP Usage**:
  - Extracted creation date and key length from published public PGP keys.
  - 5 vendors did not have a PGP key listed, and 9 vendors had weak keys (≤ 1024 bits).
  - No trend observed between key age and strength.

- **PGP-Key Reuse**:
  - Focused on vendors who imported their reputation, ensuring they operated on multiple markets.
  - Used the Grams darknet market search engine to match PGP keys.
  - Figure 4 shows the overlap between vendors with PGP keys, active on other markets, and keys listed on other markets.

- **Traceability of Cash-Out**:
  - Analyzed 19,238 unique bitcoin payout addresses.
  - 2,680 addresses (≈ 14%) were linked to known service wallets (e.g., exchanges, mixers).
  - Most vendors likely use private wallets or mixing services to avoid traceability.

#### 5.2 Security Practices Across Vendor Types

We analyze the security practices across each vendor type, performing extensive statistical testing to account for differences in sample sizes.

- **Password Strength**:
  - Kruskal-Wallis H test (p < 0.0001) indicated significant differences in password strength between vendor types.
  - Dunn post-hoc test with FDR-BH adjustment (α = 0.05) showed significant differences between Drug Lords/Dealers and Digital Fraudsters, and between Drug Dealers and Novices.

- **Password Uniqueness**:
  - χ2-test (p = 0.0064) confirmed significant differences between vendor types.
  - Post-hoc z-test of proportions with FDR-BH correction (Table 4) showed that Drug Lords and Drug Dealers had better security practices than Digital Fraudsters and Novices.

- **2FA Usage**:
  - Significant differences in 2FA usage between vendor types (Table 4).
  - Drug Lords and Drug Dealers used 2FA more frequently, while Digital Fraudsters used it less.

- **PGP Usage and Key Reuse**:
  - High PGP adoption, with only 5 vendors without PGP keys.
  - PGP-key reuse analysis (Figure 4) showed that some vendors reused keys across markets, while others created new keys.

- **Traceability of Cash-Out**:
  - Most vendors used unknown services for cash-out, reducing traceability.
  - Visualization in Figure 5 shows the distribution of known services vendors directly cash out to.
