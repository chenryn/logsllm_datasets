User: I am using appcfg.py to upload data to datastore from a csv file.
But every time I try, I am getting error:  

[info    ] Authentication failed

even if i am using Admin id and password.
In my app.yaml file I am having:

handlers:
- url: /remote_api
  script: $PYTHON_LIB/google/appengine/ext/remote_api/handler.py
  login: admin

- url: .*
  script: MainHandler.py

Can anybody please help me?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: If your administrator is an Apps for Domains account (eg, @yourdomain.com), and your app uses Google Accounts authentication, you won't be able to authenticate as an admin on your app. You need to add a Google Accounts (eg, @google.com) account as an administrator, and use that to upload.
