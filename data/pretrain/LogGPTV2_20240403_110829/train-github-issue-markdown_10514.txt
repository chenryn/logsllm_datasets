Hello. I was trying to build julia in Scientific Linux SL release 5.5 and got
something like:
        JULIA usr/lib/julia/sys.ji
    error during bootstrap: assign array[5]: index out of range
    make[1]: *** [/imports/home/s/shhong/src/julia/usr/lib/julia/sys.ji] Error 1
    make: *** [debug] Error 2
Any idea? Also, in Julia how am I supposed to probe what is wrong in the case
like this?
