User: I'm working with Web2py and Google App Engine SDK.
I have an action that works using the WSGI version, but fails when running on SDK.
Inside this action, there are no imports specific from GAE libraries... but I can't figure out what is wrong cause I only got the message:
Internal error
Ticket issued: unknown
And there is no ticket showing the error.
How can I debug web2py when working with GAE and specifically in this case?
Assistant: You have to read the logs on GAE dashboard to figure out the Python exception it is throwing
