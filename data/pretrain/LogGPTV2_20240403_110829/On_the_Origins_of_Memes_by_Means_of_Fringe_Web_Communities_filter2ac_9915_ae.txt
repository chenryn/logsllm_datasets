Table 4: Top 20 KYM entries for memes that we find our datasets. We report the number of posts for each meme as well as the percentage
over all the posts (per community) that contain images that match one of the annotated clusters. The (R) and (P) markers indicate whether a
meme is annotated as racist or politics-related, respectively (see Section 4.2.1 for the selection criteria).
4.2.2 Temporal Analysis. Next, we study the temporal aspects of
posts that contain memes from /pol/, Reddit, Twitter, and Gab. In
Fig. 7, we plot the percentage of posts per day that include memes.
For all memes (Fig. 7(a)), we observe that /pol/ and Reddit follow a
steady posting behavior, with a peak in activity around the 2016
US elections. We also find that memes are increasingly more used
on Gab (see, e.g., 2016 vs 2017).
As shown in Fig. 7(b), both /pol/ and Gab include a substantially
higher number of posts with racist memes, used over time with
a difference in behavior: while /pol/ users share them in a very
steady and constant way, Gab exhibits a bursty behavior. A possible
explanation is that the former is inherently more racist, with the
latter primarily reacting to particular world events. As for political
memes (Fig. 7(c)), we find a lot of activity overall on Twitter, Reddit,
and /pol/, but with different spikes in time. On Reddit and /pol/, the
peaks coincide with the 2016 US elections. On Twitter, we note a
peak that coincides with the 2nd US Presidential Debate on October
2016. For Gab, there is again an increase in posts with political
memes after January 2017.
4.3 Take-Aways
In summary, the main take-aways of our analysis include:
(1) Fringe Web communities use many variants of memes re-
lated to politics and world events, possibly aiming to share
weaponized information about them (see Appendix E in
[73] for some examples of weaponized memes). For instance,
Donald Trump is the KYM entry with the largest number of
clusters in /pol/ (2.2%), The_Donald (6.1%), and Gab (2.2%).
(2) /pol/ and Gab share hateful and racist memes at a higher
rate than mainstream communities, as we find a consider-
able number of anti-semitic and pro-Nazi clusters (e.g., The
Happy Merchant meme [32] appears in 1.3% of all /pol/ anno-
tated clusters and 2.2% of Gab’s, while Adolf Hitler in 0.6% of
/pol/’s). This trend is steady over time for /pol/ but ramping
up for Gab.

to Donald Trump’s US presidential campaign, among the top memes
in /pol/ (1.6%), in Reddit (0.8%), and Gab (0.8%). Similarly, in Twitter,
we find the Clinton Trump Duet meme [26] (0.4%), a meme inspired
by the 2nd US presidential debate.
We further group memes into two high-level groups, racist and
politics-related. We use the tags that are available in our KYM
dataset, i.e., we assign a meme to the politics-related group if it
has the “politics,” “2016 us presidential election,” “presidential elec-
tion,” “trump,” or “clinton” tags, and to the racism-related one if
the tags include “racism,” “racist,” or “antisemitism,” obtaining 117
racist memes(4.4% of all memes that appear on our dataset) and
556 politics-related memes (21.2% of all memes that appear on our
dataset). In the rest of this section, we use these groups to further
study the memes, and later in Sec. 5 to estimate influence.

(3) Seemingly “neutral” memes, like Pepe the Frog (or one of its
variants), are used in conjunction with other memes to incite
hate or influence public opinion on world events, e.g., with
images related to terrorist organizations like ISIS or world
events such as Brexit.
(4) Our custom distance metric successfully allows us to study
the interplay and the overlap of memes, as showcased by
the visualizations of the clusters and the dendrogram (see
Figs. 5 and 6).
5 INFLUENCE ESTIMATION
So far we have studied the dissemination of memes by looking at
Web communities in isolation. However, in reality, these influence
each other: e.g., memes posted on one community are often re-
posted to another. Aiming to capture the relationship between them,
we use a statistical model known as Hawkes Processes [56, 57],
which describes how events occur over time on a collection of
processes. This maps well to the posting of memes on different
platforms: each community can be seen as a process, and an event
occurs each time a meme image is posted on one of the communities.
Events on one process can cause impulses that can increase the
likelihood of subsequent events, including other processes, e.g., a
person might see a meme on one community and re-post it, or
share it to a different one. This approach allow us to assess the
causality of events, hence it is a far better approach when compared
to simple approaches like looking at the timeline of specific memes
or phashes.
5.1 Hawkes Processes
To model the spread of memes on Web communities, we use a
similar approach as in our previous work [74], which looked at the
spread of mainstream and alternative news URLs. Next, we provide
a brief description, and present an improved method for estimating
influence.
We use five processes, one for each of our seed Web communities
(/pol/, Gab, and The_Donald), as well as Twitter and Reddit, fitting
a separate model for each meme cluster. Fitting the model to the
data yields a number of values: background rates for each process,
weights from each process to each other, and the shape of the
impulses an event on one process causes on the rates of the others.
The background rate is the expected rate at which events will occur
on a process without influence from the communities modeled or
previous events; this captures memes posted for the first time, or
those seen on a community we do not model and then reposted on
a community we do. The weights from community-to-community
indicate the effect an event on one has on the others; for example,
a weight from Twitter to Reddit of 1.2 means that each event on
Twitter will cause an expected 1.2 additional events on Reddit.
The shape of the impulse from Twitter to Reddit determines how
the probability of these events occurring is distributed over time;
typically the probability of another event occurring is highest soon
after the original event and decreases over time.
Fig. 8 illustrates a Hawkes model with three processes. The first
event occurs on process B, which causes an increase in the rate
of events on all three processes. The second event then occurs on
process C, again increasing the rate of events on the processes.
Figure 8: Representation of a Hawkes model with three processes.
Events cause impulses that increase the rate of subsequent events
in the same or other processes. By looking at the impulses present
when events occur, the probability of a process being the root cause
of an event can be determined. Note that on the second part of the
Figure, colors represent events while arrows represent impulses be-
tween the events.
The third event occurs soon after, on process A. The fourth event
occurs later, again caused by the background arrival rate on process
B, after the increases in arrival rate from the other events have
disappeared.
To understand the influence different communities have on the
spread of memes, we want to be able to attribute the cause of a
meme being posted back to a specific community. For example, if a
meme is posted on /pol/ and then someone sees it there and posts it
on Twitter where it is shared several times, we would like to be able
to say that /pol/ was the root cause of those events. Obviously, we
do not actually know where someone saw something and decided
to share it, but we can, using the Hawkes models, determine the
probability of each community being the root cause of an event.
Looking again at Fig. 8, we see that events 1 and 4 are caused
directly by the background rate of process B. This is because, in the
case of event 1, there are no previous events on other processes,
and in the case of event 4, the impulses from previous events have
already stopped. Events 2 and 3, however, occur when there are
multiple possible causes: the background rate for the community
and the impulses from previous events. In these cases, we assign the
probability of being the root cause in proportion to the magnitudes
of the impulses (including the background rate) present at the time
of the event. For event 2, the impulse from event 1 is smaller than
the background rate of community C, so the background rate has
a higher probability of being the cause of event 2 than event 1.
Thus, most of the cause for event 2 is attributed to community
C, with a lesser amount to B (through event 1). Event 3 is more
complicated: impulses from both previous events are present, thus
the probability of being the cause is split three ways, between the
background rate and the two previous events. The impulse from
event 2 is the largest, with the background rate and event 1 impulse
smaller. Because event 2 is attributed both to communities B and C,

event 3 is partly attributed to community B through both event 1
and event 2.
In the rest of our analysis, we use this new measure. This is a sub-
stantial improvement over the influence estimation in [74], which
used the weights from source to destination community, multiplied
by the number of events on the source to estimate influence. How-
ever, this only looks at influence across a single “hop” and would
not allow us to understand the source community’s influence as
memes spread onwards from the destination community. The new
method allows us to gain an understanding of where memes that
appear on a community originally come from, and how they are
likely to spread from community to community from the original
source.
5.2 Influence
We fit Hawkes models using Gibbs sampling as described in [57] for
the 12.6K annotated clusters; in Table 5, we report the total number
of meme images posted to each community in these clusters. We
note that /pol/ has the greatest number of memes posted, followed
by Twitter and Reddit. Recall, however, that because our approach
is seeded with memes observed on /pol/, The_Donald, and Gab, it
is possible that there are memes on Twitter and Reddit that are not
included in the clusters. In addition, the raw number of images (not
necessarily memes) that appear on the different communities varies
greatly (see Table 1). This yields an additional interesting question:
how efficient are different communities at disseminating memes?
First, we report the source of events in terms of the percent of
events on the destination community. This describes the results
in terms of the data as we have collected it, e.g., it tells us the
percentage of memes posted on Twitter that were caused by /pol/.
The second way we report influence is by normalizing the values
by the total number of events in the source community, which lets
us see how much influence each community has, relative to the
number of memes they post—in other words, their efficiency.
Additional results are available in extended version of the pa-
per [73]; here we focus on the differences in the ways communities
disseminate different types of meme, in particular, racist (non-racist)
and political (non-political) memes.
Using the clusters identified as either racist or non-racist (see the
end of Sec. 4.2.1), we compare how the communities influence the

and non-racist meme postings, normalized by the number of events
in the source community.
spread of these two types of content. Fig. 9 shows the percentage
of both the destination community’s racist and non-racist meme
posts caused by the source community. We perform two-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to compare the distributions of influence
from the racist and non-racist clusters; cells with statistically sig-
nificant differences between influence of racist/non-racist memes
(with p<0.01) are reported with a * in the figure. /pol/ has the most
total influence for both racist and non-racist memes, with the no-
table exception of Twitter, where Reddit has the most the influence.
Interestingly, while the percentage of racist meme posts caused by
/pol/ is greater than non-racist for Reddit, Twitter, and Gab, this is
not the case for The_Donald. The only other cases where influence
is greater for racist memes are Reddit to The_Donald and Gab to
Reddit.
When looking at political vs non political memes (Fig. 10), we
see a somewhat different story. Here, /pol/ influences The_Donald
