ABSTRACT
This paper introduces a new security problem in which indi-
viduals movement traces (in terms of accurate routes) can be
inferred from just a series of mutual contact records and the
map of the area in which they roam around. Such contact
records may be obtained through the bluetooth communica-
tion on mobile phones. We present an approach that solve
the trace inference problem in reasonable time, and analyze
some properties of the inference algorithm.

INTRODUCTION
Location privacy and, in particular, privacy of individu-
als’ timestamped movements is receiving increasing interest.
Recent research indicates that the widespread use of WiFi
and Bluetooth enabled smartphones opens new doors for
malicious attacks, including geolocating individuals by ille-
gitimate means (e.g. spreading worm based malware) and
even legitimate means (e.g.
location based advertisement
networks and theft locators) [4, 3, 1]. However, most exist-
ing geo-localization techniques require GPS information or
additional control of hardware infrastructures such as WiFi
access points or GSM base stations. This paper presents
a new technique to infer individuals’ complete movement
traces using only their mutual contact histories and a map.
This technique can be deployed both indoors and outdoors,
so long as the area map is available. To the best of our
knowledge, the only other work that attempts to infer traces
from bluetooth contact histories is by Whitbeck et al.
[5].
However, they did not make use of a map and therefore only
produces rough moving trajectories. It also relies on the ex-
istence of various imaginary forces that are supposed to bias

the person’s movement, though it is not clear how to deter-
mine the parameters involved in the forces calculation. The
technique in this paper, on the contrary, produces detailed
movement traces according to a map.
Next we describe the Trace Inference Problem. We deﬁne
a map M as a graph (V, E), where V is a set of road junc-
tions each with geographic coordinates (x, y), and E is a set
of straight road segment. Note that a curved road can be
approximated by a sequence of straight road segments. Let
a set of nodes N move on the edges of the map at various
but constant speeds. We assume that a node never back-
tracks unless it’s at a dead end. Let the trace of node i be a
location function on time li(t), and a contact between node
i and j be a 4-tuple: (i, j, tin, tout) where tin is when the en-
counter of i and j begins, and tout is when their encounter
ends. Further, a contact history is a set of contacts. Given
the set of traces of N , we can induce all the contacts by
solving inequality ||li(t) − lj (t)|| ≤ r for all pairs of traces
by node i and j, where r is the range in which two nodes
are considered in contact. For simplicity, we assume r = 0
in the rest of this paper, and the contact induction can be
computed in O(|N|2|V |2) time.
Trace Inference Problem(TIP): Given a map M , a set
of moving nodes N , their speeds {vi}, their initial locations
{li(0)}, and a contact history H, ﬁnd the traces of N whose
induced contacts Hind = H .
Suppose the last contact in H is at tmax, the maximum
speed is vmax, the length of the shortest edge in M is emin,
and largest degree of any vertex on M is dmax, then a naive
search across all possible paths costs

2. OUR APPROACH
Our main idea is to decompose TIP into |H| subproblems,
each resolving a single contact in H. To solve a contact of i
and j at time t, we consider the locations of their last con-
tacts. The key observation is that even though there can be
many possible traces spanning from the previous locations
of i and j, only a small number of them can produce the
contact, due to the distance constraints of the map.
Fig.1 illustrates this approach. Suppose nodes A, B and
C starts their movements at t0 from point A, B and C in
the diagram. A and B contact at t1. Given A’s speed, we
know by t1, there are 5 possible traces for A ending at A1-
A5 respectively. Similarly, B has 6 possible traces and 5
locations up to time t1. Of all 15 pairs of traces between A
386and B, only 4 pairs of traces satisfy the contact constraint,
which may occur at locations marked by (A1, B1), (A4, B3)
and (A2/A3, B2). The rest of the traces are pruned and not
considered further. In the next round, B and C contact at
time t2. We repeat the above process, using B1, B2 and
B3 as the B’s initial locations for this round. As the ﬁgure
shows, the only possible trace for B left is B1 → B6 given
the short time interval between t1 and t2.

is generated by randomly selecting an origin and a desti-
nation on a map of Shanghai Jiao Tong University campus
and has a duration of 1 hour. Starting from the origin, we
randomly select the next location among all adjacent junc-
tions. A junction is more likely to be selected if it is closer
to the destination. From the traces, we can induce a list of
contacts and their locations like the following:

Each row contains information for one contact. The columns
represent the ids of two nodes in contact, the X and Y co-
ordinates of the contact location, and contact time. The
coordinates are not used in inference but in validation. We
run 11 experiments in which the sizes of contact histories
range from hundreds to 60,000. All traces are correctly in-
ferred. Fig.2 shows 5 inferred trace fragments of nodes p0
through p4, along with their initial locations and contacts.
Fig.3(A) shows the number of contacts induced in the data
set is roughly proportional to the square of the number of
nodes. Fig.3(B) shows the running times of the algorithm
on various data sets. The solid line represents results for
data on map A with 48 junctions which corresponds to the
area in Fig.2. The dotted line represents the results for data
on a smaller map B with 25 junctions. The running time is
almost linear to size of contact histories. These preliminary
results are in line with the discussion in Section 2.

Figure 1: Inference of a Short Contact History
If we model the movements and contacts as a stochastic
process, the time interval t between two successive contacts
of i and j follows the exponential distribution [2]:
P{t ≤ x} = 1 − e−λij x, x ∈ [0, ∞)
where λij is the contact rate between i and j, the expected
contact interval between i and j is E[t] = 1
. Let λij be

Let tc be the expected time to infer each contact. If the con-
tact interval of all nodes is bounded, then tc is also bounded.
Therefore, the time cost of our approach is linear to |H|,
which is also linear to tmax and |N|2.
