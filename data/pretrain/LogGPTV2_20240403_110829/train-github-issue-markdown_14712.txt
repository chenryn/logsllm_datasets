      retries: 0,
      snapshotDir: "./snapshots",

**Test file (self-contained)**
      test("should select all checkboxes by a loop", async ({ page }) => {
        page.goto(
          "https://staging.scrive.com/s/9221714692413010618/9221932570717574475/d0661b5e62380af4"
        );
        await page.waitForLoadState();
        await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");
        const checkboxes = await page.locator("rect[data-test='checkbox']").all();
        for (const checkbox of checkboxes) {
          await checkbox.click();
        }
        await expect(page.locator("[data-test='signview_sign_btn']")).toBeEnabled();
      });
**Steps**
  * npm install
  * npm test
**Expected**
All checkboxes should be checked by the end of the tests. And the Next button
on the bottom should be enabled
**Actual**
Some of the checkboxes are clicked multiple times and others are never
clicked. When I looked at the trace, it seems when playwright loops through
all the matching elements, it calls `locator.click(rect[data-test='checkbox']
>> nth=` every time, and the order of that matched list may be non
deterministic.
