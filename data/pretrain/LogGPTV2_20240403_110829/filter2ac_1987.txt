### Title: Blackhat Asia-19: Pwning the Core of IoT Botnets: From a Honeypot to Gigabytes of Botnet Source Code

Since the leak of the Mirai botnet source code in 2016, numerous variants of IoT botnets have emerged and evolved, becoming a significant cybersecurity threat. In this session, we will share the intriguing journey from setting up a single honeypot to uncovering gigabytes of botnet source code, revealing the dramatic and often competitive world of the bot herders behind these threats.

In early 2017, following the Mirai DDoS attacks, we began monitoring Telnet traffic as a hobby. Over time, multiple botnet variants with unique names (such as OWARI, SATORI, MASUTA, SORA, JOSHO, OMG, and many more) rapidly appeared. By leveraging open-source intelligence (OSINT), we tracked the distinct characteristics of these botnets and discovered various source code repositories that briefly surfaced and then disappeared on the internet. These repositories contained a vast collection of IoT botnet source code.

As we delved into the latest source code, we observed that new variants often appeared in the wild just a few weeks after their initial development. Additionally, we uncovered a series of dramatic and competitive scenarios among the bot herders. For example, some groups gained access to and wiped out other botnets in territorial disputes, while others distributed backdoored exploit scripts to their peers. There were also instances where bot herders targeted financial institutions with DDoS attacks to showcase the power of their botnets, and even attacked well-known IoT security researchers who had exposed their activities.

This entire investigation was initiated by a single home-based IoT honeypot, highlighting the potential for such simple setups to provide valuable insights into the complex and ever-evolving landscape of IoT botnets.
