Question: "In the context of DNSSEC, a name server has two key pairs: a Key Signing Key (KSK) and a Zone Signing Key (ZSK). During the verification process, certain steps are performed to establish trust in these keys. Which of the following statements correctly describe the steps involved in the verification process and the roles of KSK and ZSK?"
 "A": "The public ZSK is endorsed by the parent name server's DS record, and the DNS resolver uses the public ZSK directly to verify the signature on the set of records."
 "B": "The public KSK, endorsed by the parent name server, is used to sign the public ZSK, which the DNS resolver verifies to establish trust in the public ZSK."
 "C": "The KSK acts as a 'parent' within the name server, endorsing the 'child' ZSK by signing it, and the DNS resolver trusts the ZSK based on this endorsement."
 "D": "The DNS resolver uses the public KSK, which is signed by the root's ZSK, to verify the authenticity of the records signed by the ZSK."
