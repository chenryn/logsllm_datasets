Question: Consider the following function in a program that processes numerical data. Identify the potential vulnerabilities that might arise due to the use of signed and unsigned integers. Select all that apply.
"A": "When a signed integer is implicitly cast to an unsigned integer during a failure condition, it might result in a large positive value that can lead to buffer overflow.",
"B": "A negative signed integer used in a size calculation for memory allocation could, upon conversion to an unsigned size_t type, result in a very large value, causing memory allocation failure or excessive memory consumption.",
"C": "Using a signed integer to restrict the size of user input can inadvertently allow large memory copies if the negative value is implicitly cast to a large unsigned integer during processing.",
"D": "A function that returns a signed integer indicating the size of a memory chunk could cause an underflow when the return value is directly used in a memory copy operation without checking for errors."
Answer: ABCD
