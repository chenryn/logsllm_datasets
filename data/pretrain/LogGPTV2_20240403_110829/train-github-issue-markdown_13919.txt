 **Describe the bug**
I am not sure if this a gltf bug or a three js bug but when exporting a
skinned mesh with an armature with a specific scale the bounding box will not
work correctly, for example, I have an object with an armature of scale 0.018
for all axes and a mesh child with a scale of 1; what happens when I import it
to threejs/editor is the bounding box take the scale of the armature, as the
image below:

and, via coding, when I try to get the object size by:
`let measurementBox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject( this.threeJsObject );
measurementBox.getSize(this.objectSize);`
the result is the armature mesh child size (after scaling) multiplied by the
armature scale again!  
This means if the x dimension of a mesh after being scaled by an armature is
100 with a scale of 0.5 in the armature (actual size of the mesh is 200 then),
the bounding box x size will be 50 and not 100, it will scale too after the
mesh!
**To Reproduce**  
here is the file that I am using, the armature scale is 0.018 and the bounding
box is 0.018 of the actual size of the mesh rather than being 100% of the
actual size of the mesh.

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. just import it in threejs/editor and check the bounding box!
**Expected behavior**
the bounding box surrounds all the mesh and not being multiplied with the
armature scale, it should be like the image below:
