Step 3 of the workflow is to create the bait and prey pools of cDNAs, which are
ultimatelyusedtotestforaprotein-proteininteraction.
Step 4 (IDRemGen and InterMating). In Step 4, the bait and prey pools of clones are
broughttogethertodetecttheinteraction.Themechanismforbringingthemtogetheris
calledaninteractionmating[41].Afemalestrain(α)oftheyeastS.cerevisiaeistrans-
formedwiththepoolofbaitclones;amalestrain(a)oftheyeastS.cerevisiaeistrans-
formed with the pool of prey clones. Transformation is the process of introducing for-
eign DNA into a host; the strains of S. cerevisiae are then capable of expressing the
proteins of interest. The female and male strains are mated to bring the bait and prey
pools together. In strategy 2 this means simply pinning robotically each bait strain on
the solid media with the prey strain. Those grid points with the reporter genes on can

Step 5 (RobotPickColonies). In Step 5, we need to identify what genes are positive in
the pools. In strategy 1, we do not know which of the 96 prey reacted with which
of the 96 baits. The positives are robotically picked. The DNA of the positives is
extracted and sequenced. By comparing the resulting sequences of the bait and prey
clones, we can positively identify the partners that are interacting. These sequences
are sometimes referred to as Interaction Sequence Tags (ISTs), and they allow screen-
ing for the protein-protein interactions based on the availability of the genomic se-
quence of the organism of interest. Step 5 is the identification of the interactors by
sequencing.
Step 6 (FGDB). In Step 6, the interactors identified through their ISTs are loaded into
the Fungal Genome Database FGDB [50]. The FGDB database is web-accessible at
http://gene.genetics.uga.edutothescientificcommunitytomakeuseoftheinformation.
Step 6 involves storing, retrieving, releasing, and sharing the ISTS over the Web from
FGDB.
Step 7 (Layout). Once the ISTs are available, the data are ready to be assembled into a
protein-protein interaction map. The strongly connected components in the graph will
allowtheidentificationofputativeproteincomplexes.Severalalgorithmsforlayingout

puters and robots. For example, the libraries are generated in one laboratory, and the

works:(b)GeneFlow[34]buildaspartofalaboratoryinformationsystemformanaging

workflow,and(b)graphicaltoolstovisualizethemappingandsequencingdata[33].The

In the near term, the core objective of the proposed system is running protein-protein
interaction mapping workflows. However, we plan to use the system in other types of
genomicworkflowstoautomateidentificationofabiologicalcircuit.Therestofthissection
contains a brief discussion of the specific capabilities of IntelliGEN. The architecture of
IntelliGENisshowninfigure6.
IntelliGEN’s workflow network is presented in figure 7 (GeneFlow is a subworkflow

cess the ISTs (Interaction Sequence Tags). These workflow networks are presented here
