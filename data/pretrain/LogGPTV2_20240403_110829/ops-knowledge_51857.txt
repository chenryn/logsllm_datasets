User:  company needs to build a high-availability system to meet the demands of massive access and data processing. Please provide a suitable system architecture design, including the selection of each component and how to perform load balancing.
Assistant: For high-availability system architecture design, I recommend using the following components: 1. Load Balancers: Use load balancers to ensure that different servers are able to run, exchange load and ensure system availability. You can use open source load balancers such as HAProxy, NGINX or Apache, or commercial load balancers such as F5 or Citrix NetScaler. 2. Web server: use a common web server, such as Apache or Nginx, to process web requests and responses, and interact with the load balancer at the same time. 3. Database server: Use a highly available database service, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, to handle data processing requests. 4. Cache server: Use a cache server (such as Redis or Memcached) to cache common requests and improve system performance and response speed. 5. Storage server: Deploy a storage server suitable for the application, such as a file server, network-attached storage, or object storage. In the system architecture, it is necessary to use a load balancer to distribute requests to different web servers. These web servers will request data from the database server and cache it in the cache server. If the primary database fails, use the backup database. In addition, corresponding monitors need to be used to ensure that each component is running normally, and open source monitoring tools such as Nagios can be used. After the above components are completed, a highly available system can be established to meet the demands of massive access and data processing.
