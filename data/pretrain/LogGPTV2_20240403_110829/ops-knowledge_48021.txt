User:  How to set session timeout in Apache Tomcat server?
Assistant: To set the session timeout in the Apache Tomcat server, please follow the steps below: 1. Find the web.xml file in the Tomcat server. Usually this file is located in the conf directory of the Tomcat server. 2. In the web.xml file, find the session-config element. If it does not exist, you need to add the following configuration in the web.xml file: <session-config> <session-timeout>30</session-timeout> //The timeout unit is minutes. </session-config> You can set the timeout period according to your needs. 3. Save the web.xml file and restart the Tomcat server for the changes to take effect. Note: The timeout period is calculated in minutes. For example, if you set the timeout to 30, the session will timeout when there is no activity for 30 minutes. If you don't want the session to time out, you can set the timeout to 0, which will cause the session to never expire.
