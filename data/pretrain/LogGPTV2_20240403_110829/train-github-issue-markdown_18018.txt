I was just installing Three through npm and noticed that the code snippet and
the JS fiddle at the end of the page is using THREE.CanvasRenderer.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/three
You'll see this warning in the console:  
`"THREE.CanvasRenderer has been moved to
/examples/js/renderers/CanvasRenderer.js"`
It should probably be updated to use: `renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();`  
Fixed fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/9sp1hqvb/
The script on the page should also have that fix:
If you're installing for the first time, this would be super confusing.
Sorry if this issue is a duplicate. I searched but didn't find anything about
this.
