even, over time, decrease proactive blacklisting as Tor’s
reputation improves. These ﬁndings suggest the utility
to implement any privacy-sensitive abuse-reduction ap-
proaches for Tor.
From the emails, we learned of the types of undesired
trafﬁc that server operators ﬁnd concerning enough to
warrant sending a complaint. Of the types of abuse iden-
tiﬁed in email complaints (§4), the vast majority—the
DMCA complaints—appear irrelevant to blocking since
DMCA violators largely use peer-to-peer services. Fur-
thermore, at least in our sample they are no longer com-
mon (Table 2). Of the remaining complaints, nearly 90%
related to large-scale abuse, such as excessive connec-
tion attempts, scanning, brute-force login attempts, and
spam. While the rate of complaining might not be pro-
portional to the rate of undesired trafﬁc, it may provide
some insights into the nature of the most troubling abuse
exiting the Tor network. The exit policies have no sig-
niﬁcant impact on reducing abuse complaints and rate of
discrimination against Tor users.
Given the large footprints of the observed abuse, we
believe future research should seek to provide tools to
curb such abuse while preserving privacy and Tor func-
tionality. We envision Tor nodes using cryptographic
protocols, such as secure multi-party computation and
zero-knowledge proofs, to detect and deter users pro-
ducing large amounts of trafﬁc in patterns indicative of
abuse. For example, Tor could compute privacy-sensitive
global counts of visits to each threatened domain and
throttle exiting trafﬁc to ones that appear over-visited.
Implications for online services. Combining our study
results, we can put the difﬁculties facing Tor users and
online service operators into perspective: at most 182
email complaints per 100K Tor users, and over 20% of
the top-500 websites blocking Tor users. Given that Tor
users do make purchases at the same rate as non-Tor
users [6], this response may be excessive and operators
might wish to use less restrictive means of stiﬂing abuse.
Operators can aid Tor in developing approaches to
curb abuse or unilaterally adopt local solutions. For ex-
ample, instead of outright blocking, servers could rate-
limit users exiting from Tor for certain webpages (e.g.,
login pages). Indeed, CloudFlare is developing a crypto-
graphic scheme using blindly signed tokens to rate limit
Tor users’ access to websites it hosts [39].

Ultimately, we do not view IP-based blacklisting as
a suitable long-term solution for the abuse problem. In
addition to Tor aggregating together users’ reputations,
IPv4 address exhaustion has resulted in signiﬁcant IP ad-
dress sharing. IPv6 may introduce the opposite problem:
the abundance of addresses may make it too easy for a
single user to rapidly change addresses. Thus, in the long
run, we believe that online service operators should shift
to more advanced ways of curbing abuse; ideally, ones
compatible with Tor.

Appendix
A Picking threshold values for proactive
blacklisting
We classify a blacklist as proactive if it enlists a large
fraction of Tor exit relays within the ﬁrst 24 hours of
them appearing in the consensus.
In order to decide
the threshold for the fraction of Tor exit relays that, if
blocked within 24 hours, we should consider the black-
list, we analyze the value of the fraction for all blacklists.
We ﬁnd two blacklists: Snort IP and Paid Aggregator
blacklist 37% and 31% of all Tor exits within 24 hours,
respectively. All other blacklists listed fewer than 5% of
Tor IP addresses within 24 hours. This large difference
in the behaviour of blacklists encouraged us to pick the
threshold as 30%.
B Classifying exit policies
In this section we describe our method for classifying the
exit policies of all exit relays observed in 2015 and 2016.
Since each relay could potentially have an arbitrary set
of ports open (from the 65,535 possible ports), compar-
ing the openness of exit policies is difﬁcult. To simplify
the process, we parse the exit policy of each relay to ex-
tract the set of open ports and then compute the Jaccard
similarity between the relay’s open ports and each of the
well-known exit policies that Tor supports (Default, Re-
duced, Reduced-Reduced, Lightweight and Web). We
classify a relay into one of the 5 categories based on the
Jaccard similarity value. To ensure that the similarity in
policy is large enough, we classify the relay to the cat-
egory of highest similarity, provided that the similarity
value is at least 0.7. Only the relays with a high enough
similarity value with any of the well known exit policies
are considered for further analysis.
C IP blacklisting and relay characteristics
We train a linear regression model to ﬁnd the impact of
relay characteristics like uptime, policy, and consensus
weight on the time a relay spends on reactive blacklists.
The observed variable is the ratio of hours spent on the
blacklist to the uptime of the relay. We trained the model
on 20,500 exit relays’ data (with feature scaling) and
found that the coefﬁcients learned for all the factors are
extremely small (consensus weight = -0.00007, uptime =
0.009, policy = -0.00001). This shows that these factors
have very little impact on blacklisting of relays. It also
suggests that changing to more conservative exit policies
does not reduce the chances of relays getting blacklisted.
