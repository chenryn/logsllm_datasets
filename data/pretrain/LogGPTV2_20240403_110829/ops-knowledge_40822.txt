User: Please introduce the basic operation process of Git, and explain how to create a new branch locally and push it to the remote warehouse.
Assistant: The basic operation process of Git is as follows: 1. Create a local warehouse: use the `git init` command to create a Git warehouse in the local folder. 2. Add files to the warehouse: Use the `git add` command to add files to the temporary storage area of the Git warehouse. 3. Submit files to the warehouse: Use the `git commit` command to submit the files in the temporary storage area to the Git warehouse. 4. View the status of the warehouse: use the `git status` command to view the status of the warehouse and know which files are in what state. 5. View the commit history: Use the `git log` command to view the commit history and learn the details of each commit. 6. Branch management: Use `git branch` command for branch management, you can create, delete, view, rename branches, etc. 7. Merge branches: Use the `git merge` command to merge a branch into the current branch. 8. Submit to the remote warehouse: Use the `git push` command to push the code of the local warehouse to the remote warehouse. The steps to create a new branch locally and push it to the remote warehouse are as follows: 1. Create a new branch: use the `git branch <branch-name>` command to create a new branch. 2. Switch to a new branch: Use the `git checkout <branch-name>` command to switch to a new branch. 3. Make code modification: make code modification on the new branch. 4. Submit the code: Use the `git add` and `git commit` commands to submit the modified code to the local warehouse. 5. Push to the remote warehouse: Use the `git push -u origin <branch-name>` command to push the code of the new branch to the remote warehouse, where the `-u` parameter indicates the establishment of an association relationship between the local branch and the remote branch. 6. Merge branch: If the code modification of the new branch has been completed, you can use the `git merge` command to merge the code of the new branch into the main branch.
