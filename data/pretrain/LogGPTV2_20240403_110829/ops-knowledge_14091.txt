User: I got both python2 and python3 installed in my debian machine. But when i try to invoke the python interpreter by just typing 'python' in bash, python2 pops up and not python3. Since I am working with the latter at the moment, It would be easier to invoke python3 by just typing python. Please guide me through this.
Assistant: btw, if you are using bash or running from the shell,
and you normally include at the top of the file the following line:
#!/usr/bin/python
then you can change the line to instead be:
#!/usr/bin/python3
That is another way to have pythonX run instead of the default 
(where X is 2 or 3).
