the public, 46.2% and 72.5% respectively, believed that the RUF was responsible 
for most of the crimes committed. Coincidentally, 61.1% of the total number of 
respondents were of the same opinion while only 25.6% believed that government 
forces were also actively involved in committing war crimes. Several participants in 
the FGD sessions admitted that they knew many of the victims of the war while 
others confessed they lost loved ones, close relatives, friends and even valuables in 
the conflict. 
As a very important component of the TRC process and requirement for post 
conflict reconciliation, forgiveness is vital to durable peace and stability in Sierra 
Leone. It was, accordingly, important to find out from the respondents if they were 
ready to forgive the perpetrators. All the elites, traditional leaders as well as 80.8% 
of religious leaders and 87.1% of the members of public disclosed that they could 
forgive the perpetrators of war crimes. In the same vein, all the elites and 82.3% of 
members of the public were of the view that they could be reconciled with the per-
petrators. These findings are in line with the conclusion of the Final Report of the 
TRC that the majority of Sierra Leoneans were ready to forgive the perpetrators.
9.7 The Trc and reconciliation in post conflict sierra-Leone 
If facilitating national reconciliation was the main objective of the TRC, then the 
respondents were not impressed with the achievements of the Commission, as was 
clear from their responses. For instance, the majority of the elites 65.8% believed 
that the TRC did not facilitate reconciliation, while 72.7% of the members of the 
public believed that it facilitated reconciliation. In the total sample of respondents, 
54.3% believed that the TRC facilitated reconciliation in the country. Of the rest 
who believed that the TRC did not aid the reconciliation process, 40% were of the 
view that reconciliation is a natural process that takes a lot of time to achieve. More 
significantly, 26.7% said that the TRC officials were corrupt, while another 20.0% 
were of the view that the TRC did not meet the expectations of the victims and so 
could not promote national reconciliation. However, the majority of all the respond-
ents,  58.5%,  believed  that  the  TRC  had  healed  the  wounds  created  by  the  war, 
while 24.5% said it had not. Among the respondents, 36.4% believed that the TRC 
42
42
D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
did not heal the wounds of the war because the amputees continued to grumble over 
their excruciating conditions. They also expressed the view that the amputees were 
largely unhappy because they were not compensated. 
9.8 role of government in the reconciliation processes
It is important to point out that while 27.3% of respondents said that many people 
were generally annoyed over the activities of the Truth Commission, a very high ma-
jority, 61.8%, also expressed the view that they were not satisfied with government’s 
performance, since the end of the war. Pressed further on what they thought the 
government should do for the victims of the war, 25.0% of respondents expressed 
the view that victims should be provided with financial support although they did 
not say how much each was to receive as compensation/reparation. Also important 
is the fact that a significant number of respondents, 21.9%, suggested that rural 
people ought to have been adequately sensitized on the activities of the Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, while 12.5% said that local chiefs should have been ad-
equately involved in the truth and reconciliation process. A preponderant number of 
the elites, 84.6%, said that the government was not doing enough for the amputees 
because many of them were still on the street begging for alms; that they had not 
been empowered; and that there were no provisions for their education, food, cloth-
ing and shelter. Of those who were not satisfied with government’s handling of the 
plight of the amputees, 31.6% believed that they (amputees) needed to be empow-
ered in diverse ways, especially financially, while 26.3% suggested that they should 
be provided with either jobs or loans to start small scale businesses. 
Finally, all the traditional and religious leaders, as well as the elites/political 
leaders, were unanimous in the view that they all have important roles to play in re-
storing peace to Sierra Leone. When they were further asked what their roles should 
be, the traditional leaders said that encouraging the local people to swear by means 
associated  with  shrines  and  other  revered  places,  would  have  compelled  them  to 
speak the truth, which would have made a significant contribution to the TRC proc-
ess. On their part, the religious leaders acknowledged their role to be that of always 
preaching the message of peaceful co-existence to their congregations. Asked if they 
were satisfied with government’s reconciliation policies, only 26% of the traditional 
leaders described government’s performance as satisfactory, 62.0% said it was very 
unsatisfactory while 12% were of the view that government policies betrayed the 
victims of the war and impunity.
9.9 awareness of local mechanisms for promoting reconciliation
Ideally, local mechanisms for reconciliation should be used as much as possible in 
post conflict societies like those in Africa. Among other things, they are cheaper, 
local community friendly, and also likely to command acceptance from the people. 
Depending on the circumstances and how they are used, they could also be much

more efficient than the borrowed or externally-imposed ones. It was therefore im-
portant to find out from the respondents if there were any indigenous mechanisms 
for promoting reconciliation among the various groups in the country, and whether 
they were used (Table 9).
When the respondents were probed further on whether they were aware of lo-
cal methods for promoting truth and reconciliation, 64.8% believed that there were 
no local methods while only 35.2% said there were local techniques. Of those who 
agreed  that  local  methods  existed,  28.1%  identified  swearing  by  the  individual’s 
belief system. The Majority of the elites (66.7%) and traditional leaders (59.1%) 
believed that the local methods would have been more successful while the majority 
of the members of the public 62.0% and religious leaders 61.5% believed that the 
local methods would not have been as successful as the method used by the TRC.
There was divergence of views between the survey respondents and par-
ticipants in the FGDs on the efficacy of the TRC versus traditional or local 
methods of reconciliation. Most FGD participants expressed the view that if 
local methods had been adopted, they would have been more successful. Ac-
cording to them
Many people were not sincere in their testimonies and some that had deep scars and pains 
of the war and who should have been allowed to speak were merely spectators at the 
proceedings. (FGD3)
Some of the participants in the FGDs were of the view that the TRC was based 
on western values of truth and reconciliation, while it operated in an alien African 
environment that was far from western1. FGD participants believed that traditional 
means  of  truth  telling  and  reconciliation  such  as  going  to  villages  for  cleansing 
should have been used, since the atrocities committed by the rebels and Kamajors 
were believed to have offended the gods who, in turn, had to be appeased in the af-
fected communities.
1. Yes, the TRC Chair is a Sierra Leonean but no effort was made to use local mechanisms of recon-
ciliation and truth telling by the Commission.

The traditional chiefs should have pioneered the reconciliation. They should have 
used traditional means such as swearing by the gods which people fear so much. 
That would have encouraged many to speak the truth in the process. The local chiefs 
should have been in charge of everything. (FGD3)
Among the respondents, those who believed that the present peace would endure 
reasoned that peace is God given, and that rehabilitation and reconciliation are al-
ready taking place, even if they are halting sometimes, and that no Sierra Leonean 
wants war again, people are tired of fighting.

From Table 10 above, a majority of elites/political leaders, 73.7%, 81.0% of mem-
bers of the public, 52. 0% of the traditional leaders and an overwhelming number 
of religious leaders, 80.8%, believed that the present peace would endure. Of the 
total number of respondents, 70.9% were confident that the peace would hold, in 
spite of the challenges facing the government and people. General war weariness 
and the harsh realities of life for those caught between the government and rebel 
forces were a good lesson in keeping the peace. Yet, 29.1% of all the respondents still 
harbour the suspicion that war may break out in the country if care is not taken. 
They expressed fear that peace might not last for long; that government seemed not 
to have learnt any lessons from the past; that there were still cases of flagrant abuse 
of public office by office holders; as those at present in power wanted to hold on to 
it by all means possible, many other fundamental causes of the war were yet to be 
effectively addressed. The present government, they noted, would open old wounds, 
unless the attitude of public officers’ changed for the better. This pessimism was 
shared by FGD discussants.
Unless we change attitude, I am afraid, we may experience another war. (FGD 4)
Lastly, survey interview respondents thought that the TRC’s recommendations were 
not fully implemented and that on the whole, the Commission had not been a suc-
cess. This last point is important in the light of the views of the FGD participants 
who noted that what is in place now is conditional peace; it will only endure if the 
4
A m a d u   S e s a y
recommendations of the TRC are fully implemented. However, those who strongly 
believed that the peace was tenuous and might not last for long, expressed the view 
that the root causes of the war had not been addressed.
10. conclusion: ownership, capacity and long-term utility  
  of a truth commission
It may yet be too early to pass a definitive judgment on the effects of the TRC proc-
ess in Sierra Leone on national reconciliation and peace building. Nonetheless, cer-
tain important issues are already obvious and call for critical attention. The first is 
that the long-term success of the Commission cannot be divorced from the general 
post war climate in Sierra Leone. This is vital because the state is itself being “refor-
matted” by the international community after over a decade of debilitating civil war 
that left its economy and political institutions in a complete shambles. Of course, 
it  is  inconceivable  that  it  would  on  its  own  embark  upon  extensive  and  credible 
programmes of reconciliation and reconstruction if that means meeting the needs 
of its citizens especially those who had suffered physical and emotional losses, etc. 
Put differently, the success of a TRC will depend to a large extent on whether it is 
able to address the background conditions that led to the hostilities on the one hand, 
and on the other, its ability to put in place mechanisms that will effect qualitative 
changes to the post conflict political and social conditions of the population in par-
ticular and the country in general. This point was stressed by Rodolfo Mattarollo, 
of UNAMSIL in Freetown in 2002.  
In countries where they have had the greatest impact, truth commission reports, and 
especially their conclusions and recommendations, have acted as a kind of founda-
tion stone, signalling a society’s decision to turn over a new page in its history. In 
this way, the society in question has also shown determination to move into a new 
phase in which the rule of law can prevail, democracy can be built and human rights 
can be respected, guaranteed, and promoted…in fact an important characteristic of 
truth commissions…has been their clear desire to break with the past (Mattarollo 
2002:19). 
Two broad points can be discerned from this conclusion. First, it should be clear by 
now, even to the casual observer, whether the objective situation in Sierra Leone, post 
TRC, has significantly changed or not. The second point is that given the present 
position of the victims of war-time crimes, especially those identified in the Final 
Report of the TRC as having special needs, it may not be out of place to conclude 
that truth-telling as a means of healing the wounds of the past and coping with 
the future, without socio-economic empowerment is ephemeral; a mere short-term 
palliative that does not address substantive and long-term needs in the post conflict 
dispensation. This cynicism is also shared by the Final Report of the TRC: 
4
D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
Truth-telling without reparations could be perceived by the victims as an incomplete 
process in which they revealed their pain and suffering without any mechanism in 
place to deal with the consequences of that pain or to substantially alter the mate-
rial circumstances of their lives. In that regard, the Commission concurs with the 
view expressed by the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission that 
without adequate reparation and rehabilitation measures, there can be no healing 
or reconciliation.1 
Given the inability of the government to implement most of the recommendations 
of the TRC, the above conclusion has serious implications for lasting peace in the 
country. Besides, even if the peace were to be preserved, it would not address the
