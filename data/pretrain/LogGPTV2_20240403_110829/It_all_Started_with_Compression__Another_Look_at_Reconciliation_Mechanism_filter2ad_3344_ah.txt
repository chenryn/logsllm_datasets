### Public Perception of Responsibility for War Crimes

According to the survey, 46.2% and 72.5% of the public, respectively, believed that the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) was responsible for most of the crimes committed during the conflict. Additionally, 61.1% of the total respondents shared this view, while only 25.6% believed that government forces were also actively involved in committing war crimes. During the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), several participants admitted to knowing many of the victims, while others confessed to losing loved ones, close relatives, friends, and even valuables in the conflict.

### Forgiveness as a Component of Post-Conflict Reconciliation

Forgiveness is a critical component of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) process and is essential for achieving durable peace and stability in Sierra Leone. To gauge the public's readiness to forgive, the survey found that all elites, traditional leaders, 80.8% of religious leaders, and 87.1% of the general public indicated their willingness to forgive the perpetrators of war crimes. Similarly, all elites and 82.3% of the public expressed their willingness to be reconciled with the perpetrators. These findings align with the TRC's Final Report, which concluded that the majority of Sierra Leoneans were ready to forgive the perpetrators.

### The TRC and National Reconciliation

If facilitating national reconciliation was the primary objective of the TRC, the survey responses suggest mixed success. For instance, 65.8% of the elites believed that the TRC did not facilitate reconciliation, while 72.7% of the public believed it did. In the total sample, 54.3% of respondents felt that the TRC facilitated reconciliation. Among those who disagreed, 40% viewed reconciliation as a natural, time-consuming process, 26.7% cited corruption among TRC officials, and 20.0% believed the TRC did not meet the expectations of the victims. However, 58.5% of all respondents believed that the TRC had healed the wounds created by the war, while 24.5% thought it had not. A significant 36.4% of respondents believed the TRC failed to heal the wounds because amputees continued to suffer and were largely unhappy due to a lack of compensation.

### Role of Government in the Reconciliation Process

While 27.3% of respondents expressed general dissatisfaction with the TRC's activities, a high majority of 61.8% were dissatisfied with the government's performance since the end of the war. When asked about the government's role in supporting war victims, 25.0% suggested providing financial support, though they did not specify the amount. Another 21.9% recommended better sensitization of rural communities about the TRC's activities, and 12.5% called for greater involvement of local chiefs in the reconciliation process. A significant 84.6% of elites criticized the government for not doing enough for the amputees, noting that many were still begging on the streets without adequate support for education, food, clothing, and shelter. Of those dissatisfied, 31.6% believed the amputees needed empowerment, particularly financial, and 26.3% suggested providing jobs or loans for small-scale businesses.

### Roles of Traditional and Religious Leaders in Restoring Peace

All traditional and religious leaders, along with elites and political leaders, agreed that they have important roles in restoring peace to Sierra Leone. Traditional leaders suggested that encouraging local people to swear by means associated with shrines and other revered places would compel them to speak the truth, contributing significantly to the TRC process. Religious leaders acknowledged their role in preaching messages of peaceful coexistence. Only 26% of traditional leaders were satisfied with the government's reconciliation policies, while 62.0% found them very unsatisfactory, and 12% believed the policies betrayed the victims of the war and promoted impunity.

### Awareness of Local Mechanisms for Promoting Reconciliation

Local mechanisms for reconciliation are often more cost-effective, community-friendly, and likely to gain acceptance in post-conflict societies. The survey found that 64.8% of respondents believed there were no local methods for promoting reconciliation, while 35.2% said there were. Among those who agreed, 28.1% identified swearing by an individualâ€™s belief system. The majority of elites (66.7%) and traditional leaders (59.1%) believed local methods would have been more successful, while the majority of the public (62.0%) and religious leaders (61.5%) believed the TRC method was more effective.

### Endurance of Present Peace

A majority of elites (73.7%), members of the public (81.0%), traditional leaders (52.0%), and religious leaders (80.8%) believed the present peace would endure. Overall, 70.9% of respondents were confident that peace would hold, despite challenges. However, 29.1% harbored suspicions that war might break out again if issues such as government corruption, abuse of power, and unaddressed root causes of the war were not resolved. This pessimism was echoed by FGD participants, who stressed the need for attitude change to prevent another conflict.

### Conclusion: Ownership, Capacity, and Long-Term Utility of a Truth Commission

It may be too early to make a definitive judgment on the TRC's impact on national reconciliation and peacebuilding in Sierra Leone. However, certain issues are clear and require critical attention. The long-term success of the TRC depends on the post-war climate and the state's capacity to implement credible programs of reconciliation and reconstruction. The TRC's recommendations must address the root causes of the conflict and put in place mechanisms for qualitative changes in the post-conflict environment. Without adequate reparation and rehabilitation, truth-telling alone is insufficient for lasting peace and healing. The TRC's Final Report and the views of FGD participants emphasize that the current peace is conditional and will only endure if the TRC's recommendations are fully implemented.
