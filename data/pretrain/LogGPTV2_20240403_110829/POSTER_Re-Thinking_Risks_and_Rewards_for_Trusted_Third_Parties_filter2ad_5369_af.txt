### Introduction of the Clipper System in the US

The Clipper system, first introduced in the United States, was a hardware encryption device with hardwired keys. These keys were copied and split into two parts, which were then stored with government agencies [19]. The introduction of this system was done with minimal consultation with potential users, leading to significant resistance. This opposition was directed both at the general concept of key escrow and the specific implementation of the Clipper system.

One of the key features of the Clipper chip was the inclusion of an algorithm developed by the National Security Agency (NSA), known as Skipjack. This algorithm was claimed to provide strong confidentiality, but its details were not made public. Despite these claims, the adoption of Clipper in the US has been minimal, and many observers now believe that key escrow is no longer a viable option for the foreseeable future.

The Clipper controversy in the US sparked a heated and highly public debate about key escrow and the legal interception of communications. In the UK, the debate on key escrow has been more subdued, even though there are concrete proposals for key escrow under consideration. The UK's approach aims to balance the need for individual privacy with the requirements of law enforcement agencies to intercept communications when necessary. One issue with the UK's approach is the use of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) infrastructure, which some have mistakenly equated with key escrow. A TTP infrastructure is essential for providing trust in an electronic business environment, but the services provided by TTPs do not necessarily include key escrow.

### Key Escrow in the UK

In the UK, the 1985 Interception of Telecommunications Act grants security services and law enforcement agencies the right to eavesdrop on any communication with the appropriate warrant. UK telecommunications companies must comply with this act. The ability to eavesdrop on encrypted communications through key escrow techniques does not grant new powers; it merely preserves an existing capability. Balancing the freedoms required in a civilized society with the necessary restrictions to ensure those freedoms is a challenging task.

Key escrow should not be seen as a substitute for proper backup procedures. Sensitive data, including key material, should be regularly backed up. If a secret key is lost, key recovery can be achieved by obtaining the backup copy. Backup procedures are a matter of internal policy, and key escrow should not replace them. However, key escrow techniques can be used to implement a key recovery policy, although other methods can also be employed. Key escrow is primarily about the interception of communications, not the recovery of keys.

### The UK Key Escrow Proposal

The UK government favors a key escrow scheme for use on its networks, based on a system developed by a team at Royal Holloway, London [20]. This scheme is built around a TTP infrastructure and is designed to meet a set of reasonable criteria. Given the likelihood of a TTP infrastructure emerging to support electronic commerce, it makes sense to design a key escrow scheme consistent with this future framework. Currently, there are no proposals to outlaw the use of any form of cryptography within the UK. However, TTPs providing confidentiality services may not be granted an operating license unless they also implement a suitable key escrow mechanism.

The objectives of the Royal Holloway (RH) scheme [20] include:

- Beneficial use for the user.
- Support for both national and international operation.
- Public disclosure of the scheme's details.
- Use of well-known techniques.
- Support for all forms of electronic communication.
- Compatibility with existing legislation on the use, export, and sale of cryptographic mechanisms and warranted interception.
- Provision of warranted access to both incoming and outgoing communications.
- Support for various encryption algorithms in both hardware and software.
- Prevention of false evidence fabrication by the agency with warranted access.
- User ability to update keys according to their own internal security policies.
- Detectability of abuse by either side.
- Communication only with the user's own TTP.
- No requirement for online communication between TTPs.

The scheme, in broad terms, is an authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange where TTPs provide authentication and generate some of the key material. We will follow the presentation of Jeffries, Mitchell, and Walker, referring readers to the original paper [20] for more detail. For simplicity, we will consider one-way communication where Alice wishes to send an encrypted email to Bob.

We will consider the situation where Alice and Bob are clients of different TTPs, labeled TIPA and TTPB, respectively. Before Alice and Bob can communicate, their respective TTPs must agree on some parameters. We assume that the appropriate authenticity and confidentiality mechanisms are in place between the TTPs, and they share a secret key, KAB. Alice and Bob will use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system to exchange a key for use in a secret-key cryptosystem. The actual secret-key encryption algorithm is largely irrelevant for our purposes here.

The TTPs agree on a common modulus g and a large prime p for use with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism. They also agree on a deterministic key generating function f, which takes as input the client's name and the shared secret key KAB. The output from this function is an integer that becomes the client's private receive key. Thus, Bob has a private receive key, β, given by:

\[ \beta = f(\text{Bob}, K_{AB}) \]

From this, Bob's public receive key can be calculated as:

\[ g^\beta \mod p = g^{f(\text{Bob}, K_{AB})} \mod p \]

This key becomes Bob's public key for secure communication between Bob and any of TIPA's clients. Similarly, Alice must be equipped with a private send key, α. This can be generated by her TTP or by Alice herself. Her public send key must be certified by TIPA, and Alice should possess the appropriate certificate. Alice's public send key is calculated in the same way as Bob's public receive key and is \( g^\alpha \mod p \). Alice must also have access to Bob's public receive key, which she can obtain from her TTP.

Alice is now in possession of the following:

- Her own private send key.
- A certificate for her public send key signed by her own TTP.
- The public receive key of Bob certified by her TTP.
- The parameters g and p.

Alice is now in a position to send Bob an encrypted message. She sends Bob the following:

- The message encrypted using the session key \( g^{\alpha\beta} \mod p \).
- Her own signed public send key \( g^\alpha \mod p \).
- The signed public key of Bob \( g^\beta \mod p \).

Upon receipt of this information, Bob uses Alice's copy of his public receive key to find the corresponding private receive key, β. Bob can now easily generate the secret session key by taking Alice's signed send key and raising it to the power β mod p.

Warranted interception can now be achieved easily. The intercepting authority retrieves the private key of Alice (or Bob) from the TTP within its jurisdiction. From this, the corresponding secret session key can be calculated from the public key of Bob (or Alice). There is no need for the intercepting authority to obtain the private keys of both users.

This escrow scheme has been constructed to satisfy the design requirements and provides a neat solution to escrow on a TTP infrastructure. Additional features of the scheme are examined in more detail in Jeffries, Mitchell, and Walker [20].

### Conclusions

We have examined some of the basic technologies that will underpin the security of a future global business environment. Strong cryptographic techniques for both authentication and confidentiality will allow us to have confidence in that environment. The design of good cryptosystems is a complex process, but the overall principles are understood. With recent advances in computing power, the key size required to achieve a particular security level has increased. 40-bit secret-key cryptography no longer provides adequate security for systems carrying valuable data.

Export controls on cryptography ensure that exported commercial, off-the-shelf products use cryptography no stronger than a 40-bit secret-key system. The use of escrowed cryptography has meant that some governments are prepared to relax export controls provided the keys are escrowed with them before export. This should be considered when assessing products claiming to offer the same security as a 128-bit secret-key system. If you do not mind the exporting country's government holding most of the key, these products probably offer good security.

Secret-key and public-key systems are fundamentally different. Their security derives from different properties, but both are important technologies for securing the networks of the future. The use of public-key techniques allows us to transfer trust away from the network infrastructure and onto the data itself. Trusted data carries its own integrity and can be stored anywhere. This trust is supplied by an infrastructure of trusted third parties, which we believe is necessary for the successful introduction of electronic commerce on a wide scale.
