The system first introduced in the US  was known as Clipper and consisted of 
a  hardware  encryption  device  with  hardwired  keys  that  were  copied,  split  into 
two  parts  and  lodged with  government bodies  [19].  This system  was  apparently 
introduced with very little consultation with potential users and, not surprisingly, 
there was an enormous resistance both to  the general concept of escrow and  the 
specific  implementation of Clipper.  One of the  features  of the  Clipper chip  was 
that it contained an  algorithm developed by  the  NSA  known  as  Skipjack which 
was  claimed  to  offer  strong  confidentiality.  The  details  of  Skipjack  were  not 
released.  It is fair  to  say that the  take-up of Clipper in  the  US  has been minimal 
and many observers now believe escrow is off the menu for some time. The Clip(cid:173)
per debacle  in  the  US  sparked  a huge,  vociferous  and  very  public  debate  about 
the question of escrow  and legal interception of communications.  In  the  UK the 
debate has been somewhat muted despite there being very real proposals for key 
escrow under discussion. Again the system in  the UK aims  to  balance the  needs 
of individuals for confidentiality  with  the  requirements  of the  law  enforcement 
agencies  to  intercept communications, if necessary.  One  of the  problems  of the 
approach adopted by  the UK is  that it utilizes a TIP infrastructure.  This is  not a 
problem in itself for as we shall see the UK proposals are a nice attempt to  strike 
the  right  balance  consistent  with  likely  emerging  technologies.  However,  the 
problem has been that some people have now erroneously identified the concept 
90  CRYPTOGRAPHY 
of a TIP infrastructure with  that of key  escrow.  A TTP infrastructure  is  neces(cid:173)
sary to provide the trust in an electronic business environment. The services sup(cid:173)
plied by the TIPs on this network do not have to include escrow. 
We  shall  discuss  the  UK  proposals  in  some  detail  in  section  5.5.3.  Firstly, 
however, it is  useful to understand some points about the issue of key escrow in 
general.  In  the  UK  at  least  the  1985  Interception  of Telecommunications  Act 
enshrines in  law the right of the security services and law enforcement agencies 
to eavesdrop on any communication upon production of the appropriate warrant. 
UK telcos  operate  within  the  law  and  must comply  with  this  act.  The  ability  to 
eavesdrop on  encrypted communications  through  the  use  of escrow  techniques 
does not give these agencies any fundamental new powers. It merely preserves an 
already existing capability.  Balancing the freedoms  required by a civilized soci(cid:173)
ety with the necessary restrictions required to guarantee those freedoms is a diffi(cid:173)
cult task. 
Escrow  is  not  a  substitute  for  proper  back  up  procedures.  Sensitive  data, 
including  key  material,  should  be  regularly  backed  up.  Should  the  secret  key 
become lost, key recovery is simply a matter of obtaining the back-up copy. The 
back-up procedures are a matter of internal policy and key escrow should not be 
seen  as  a  replacement  for  those  procedures.  Key  escrow  techniques  can,  how(cid:173)
ever, be used as  a means of implementing a key  recovery  policy although other 
techniques can also be used. Escrow is really about the interception of communi(cid:173)
cations not about recovery of keys. 
5.5.3 
The  UK key  escrow proposal 
The escrow scheme favoured by the UK government for use on its own networks 
is  based upon  a system invented by the  team based at Royal  Holloway,  London 
[20].  This scheme is built around a TIP infrastructure and was designed to meet 
a set of reasonable  criteria.  Given  that  it is  likely that a TIP infrastructure  will 
emerge in support of electronic commerce it would seem sensible to design a key 
escrow  scheme  consistent  with  this  future  framework.  At  present  there  are  no 
proposals  to  outlaw  the  use  of any  form  of cryptography  in  the  UK within  its 
borders.  However,  it  is  likely  that  TIPs providing  confidentiality  services  will 
not  be  granted  an  operating  licence  unless  they  also  implement  some  suitable 
escrow mechanism. 
The objectives, or design criteria, that the Royal Holloway (RH) scheme [20] 
was engineered to satisfy are that: 
• 
• 
• 
use of the scheme should be beneficial for the user; 
the scheme should allow both national and international operation; 
details of the scheme should be made public; 
GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF CRYPTOGRAPHY  91 
• 
• 
• 
it should be based upon well-known techniques; 
all forms of electronic communication should be supported; 
the scheme should be compatible with existing legislation on the use, export 
and sale of cryptographic mechanisms and with warranted interception; 
•  warranted  access  must  be  provided  to  both  incoming  and  outgoing 
communications; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the  scheme  should  be  capable  of  supporting  a  variety  of  encryption 
algorithms in both hardware and software; 
the  agency  with  warranted  access  should  not  be  able  to  fabricate  false 
evidence; 
if  required,  users  should  be  able  to  update  keys  according  to  their  own 
internal security policies; 
abuse by either side should be detectable by the other; 
users should only have to communicate with their own TIP; 
on-line communication between TIPs should not be required. 
The scheme in broad terms is an authenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange 
where  the  TIPs  provide  the  authentication  and  generate  some  of the  key  ma(cid:173)
terial.  We shall follow  the presentation of Jeffries, Mitchell  and Walker closely, 
although  for  more  detail  the  reader is  referred to  the  original  [20].  As  with  the 
original paper we shall, for convenience, only consider one-way communication 
where Alice wishes to send an encrypted e-mail to Bob. 
We  shall  consider the  situation where Alice and Bob are  clients  of different 
TIPs labelled TIPA and TTP B,  respectively.  Before Alice and Bob can commu(cid:173)
nicate,  their respective  TIPs must agree  on  some parameters.  We  shall  assume 
that  the  appropriate  authenticity  and  confidentiality  mechanisms  are  in  place 
between the TIPs and in particular we assume they share a secret key. KAB• Alice 
and Bob will use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange system to exchange a key for 
use  in  a secret-key cryptosystem.  The  actual  secret-key encryption  algorithm  is 
largely irrelevant for our purposes here. 
The TIPs agree between them  a common modulus g and a large prime p for 
use with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism. TIPA may establish a dif(cid:173)
ferent value for g and p with another TIP. They also agree on a deterministic key 
generating function/which takes as input the client's name and the  shared secret 
92  CRYPTOGRAPHY 
key KAB• The output from  this function is an integer which becomes that client's 
private receive key. Thus Bob has a private receive key,  ~,given by: 
From this Bob's public receive key can be calculated as: 
~ 
g  mod  p  = g 
f(Bob, KAB) 
mod  p 
... (5.28) 
... (5.29) 
This key becomes Bob's public key for  secure communication between Bob 
and any of TIP A'S clients. Similarly Alice must be equipped with a private send 
key, a.. This can either be generated by her TIP or it could be generated by Alice 
herself.  Either  way  her  public  send  key  must  be  certified  by  TIP A  and  Alice 
should possess the appropriate certificate. Alice's public send key is calculated in 
the same way as Bob's public receive key and is gCLmod  p. Alice must also have 
access  to  Bob's  public  receive  key.  She  can  obtain  the  certified  key  from  her 
TIP. 
Alice is now in possession of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
her own private send key; 
a certificate for her public send key signed by her own TTP; 
the public receive key of Bob certified by her TIP; 
the parameters g and p. 
Alice is now in a position to send Bob an encrypted message. She sends Bob 
the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the message encrypted using the session key g(l~ mod p; 
her own signed public send key gCL  mod p; 
the signed public key of Bob g~ mod p. 
Upon receipt of this information Bob uses Alice's copy of his public receive 
key to find the corresponding private receive key,  ~ (note that there will be a dif(cid:173)
ferent receive key pair for each TIP that has an agreement with Bob's TIP). Bob 
can now easily generate the secret session key by taking Alice's signed send key 
and raising it to the power ~ mod p. 
Warranted  interception  can  now  be  achieved  easily.  The  intercepting 
authority  retrieves  the  private  key  of Alice  (or  Bob)  from  the  TIP within  its 
CONCLUSIONS  93 
jurisdiction.  From  this  the  corresponding  secret  session  key  can  be  calculated 
from  the  public  key  of  Bob  (Alice).  Notice  that  there  is  no  need  for  the 
intercepting authority to obtain the keys of private keys of both users. 
This escrow scheme has been constructed to  satisfy the  design  requirements 
and provides a neat solution to escrow  on  a TIP infrastructure.  There are other 
features  of the scheme which we  have not discussed but which are  examined in 
more detail in Jeffries, Mitchell and Walker  [20]. 
5.6  CONCLUSIONS 
We  have  looked  at  the  some  of the  basic  technologies  that  will  underpin  the 
security  of  a  future  global  business  environment.  Strong  cryptographic 
techniques  for  both  authentication  and  confidentiality  will  allow  us  to  have 
confidence in that environment. 
The design of good cryptosystems is  something of a black art but the overall 
principles are understood. With recent advances in computing power the key size 
required  to  achieve  a  particular  security  level  has  increased.  40-bit  secret-key 
cryptography no longer provides adequate security for systems carrying valuable 
data. 
The  export  controls  on  cryptography  guarantee  that  exported  commercial, 
off-the-shelf products use cryptography  that is  no  stronger than  a 40-bit secret(cid:173)
key system. The use of escrowed cryptography has meant that some governments 
are  prepared  to  relax  the  export  controls  provided  the  keys  are  escrowed  with 
them  before  export.  This  should  be  borne  in  mind  when  assessing  products 
claiming to offer the same security as  a  128-bit secret-key system.  If you do not 
mind  the  exporting  country's  government  holding  most  of the  key,  then  these 
products probably offer good security. 
Secret-key and public-key systems  are fundamentally  different beasts.  Their 
security derives from different properties. However, both are important technolo(cid:173)
gies for  securing the networks of the future.  In particular,  the  use  of public-key 
techniques  allows  us  to  transfer the  trust  away  from  the  network  infrastructure 
and on to  the data itself. Trusted data carries with it its own  integrity and can be 
stored anywhere.  This trust is  supplied by an  infrastructure  of trusted third par(cid:173)
ties.  It is  this  infrastructure  that  we  believe  to  be  necessary  for  the  successful 
introduction of electronic commerce on a wide scale.
