User: Please describe the implementation principle of the fire suppression system and provide a simple demonstration.
Assistant: The realization principle of the fire fighting system can be divided into three steps: detect fire, issue an alarm and report to the scene, and automatically or manually extinguish the fire source. 1. Fire detection: Fire suppression systems will install various types of sensors and detectors, such as smoke sensors, temperature detectors, and gas detectors. In the event of a fire, these sensors immediately detect the presence of a fire and send a signal to the center console. 2. Send an alarm and report to the scene: After receiving the signal from the sensor, the central console will immediately send an alarm to notify the fire brigade, and report the scene of the fire to relevant personnel or organizations, including the location, scale, and degree of smog of the fire and casualties etc. 3. Automatically or manually extinguishing the fire source: According to the time of the fire and the situation on the spot, the fire extinguishing system will automatically or manually extinguish the fire source. The methods used include automatic release of fire extinguishing agent, water curtain spray, fire extinguisher and emergency evacuation, etc. . At the same time, the fire fighting system will monitor the entire fire extinguishing process to ensure the fire extinguishing effect and prevent the fire from spreading.
