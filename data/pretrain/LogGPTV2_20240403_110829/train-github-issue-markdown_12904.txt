#### Challenge Name
All challenges are affected.
#### Issue Description
When you finish a level and then start a new one and click a position in the
editor, often the cursor will appear to be in the correct position but
actually will be one line below when one types a character.
Arrow key navigation also is not working as expected until said character is
typed, as the cursor jumps to and from the next line at positions that do not
match the natural line breaks of the text. This behavior can be seen by
holding the left or right arrow keys after the above first click.
