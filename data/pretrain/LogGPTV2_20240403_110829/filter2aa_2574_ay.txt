 Summary
When searching for a person online, make sure to try different websites to do the job 
because each service aggregates its information from different databases. The indexing 
mechanisms also differ between sites. It is also advisable to begin your search on social 
media; if you find useful information about the target, you can conduct a more thorough 
search using the sites covered in this chapter.
In the next chapter, we will continue our discussion of how to locate people online, 
but this time using the geographical information that comes with people’s Internet usage 
and social media activities.

CHAPTER 7
Online Maps
Tracking users’ geolocation information has become increasingly popular with the 
advance of computing devices, mobile communications, and social media platforms 
because these technologies make posting someone’s current location online a matter of 
clicking one button.
Nowadays, many types of electronic devices come equipped with satellite tracking 
sensors to determine their location on the map. Almost all handheld devices—such 
as smartphones and wearable devices—are now location aware. Many apps in major 
software stores such as Apple and Google Play have the ability to use the geolocation 
sensor of the smartphone/tablet to offer a customized experience or to offer certain 
functions to the device’s user. In fact, most applications, online services, and social 
media platforms can track a user’s location in one way or another.
In this chapter, we will demonstrate how you can exploit the geolocation information 
that comes with many users’ online activities to determine their current and previous 
locations. We will also cover many useful online services that can help you to track 
everything online including vehicles, ships, shipments, airplanes, and people. You’ll also 
learn how to research different online map repositories to gather intelligence.
But before we begin, we will describe in simple terms how navigation systems—
which are responsible for determining people’s current locations—work.
 The Basics of Geolocation Tracking
Most people do not care about the underlying technology responsible for delivering 
location-based services to them. People enter the address of the location they need to 
look up on the map, or they use the built-in feature available in smartphones to geotag 
digital files (such as images and videos) so they record the current location of images/
videos as a meta tag automatically. In other instances, many social media platforms, 
286
especially Facebook and Twitter, allow their users to post their current location online 
(called a check-in on Facebook) with just a single click, and the rest is handled by the 
electronic device.
To determine someone’s current geographical spot, location-aware devices need 
to communicate with a satellite navigation system that is in turn is responsible for 
delivering the exact coordinates of the location on Earth.
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an American satellite navigation system 
developed and operated by the U.S. government; it is considered the most popular 
navigation system on Earth and is used by a large number of electronic devices 
worldwide. Of course, there are other navigation systems such as the Russian system 
named GLONASS, the BeiDou system owned by China, or the Galileo run by the 
European Union. These systems are supported by different device manufacturers.
For GPS to know your current location, it needs to determine the exact coordinate 
where you are currently standing. So, what do we mean by the geographic coordinate?
A geographic coordinate system is a system that locates points on Earth using two 
coordinate values: latitude and longitude. By knowing the two values, you can visualize 
any point on Earth on a map.
 How to Find the GPS Coordinates of Any Location 
on a Map
To find the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of any geographical spot on Earth 
using Google Maps, follow these steps:
 1. Go to Google Maps at https://maps.google.com.
 2. Click anywhere on the map where you want to see the GPS 
coordinates. A small box appears in the bottom of the Google 
Maps page showing the current location GPS coordinates  
(see Figure 7-1).
 3. To further investigate a selected location, click the coordinate 
numbers, and Google will take you to a closer view of the target 
location in addition to giving you its mailing address  
(if applicable).

Note! the first Gps number represents the latitude, and the second represents 
the longitude.
Note! You can also find the latitude and longitude of a point by going to  
http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html. Click the map and drag the marker 
to the desired location. You can also enter the address (street, city, state, and 
country) in the search box to look up the Gps coordinates on map.
to convert latitude and longitude to decimal, go to https://andrew.hedges.

 How to Find the Geocode Coordinates from a Mailing  
Address
If you have an address for a specific location on Earth but you do not know how to find 
its geocode coordinates on the map, go to the following free services:
• 
Batch Geocoding (https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding.
php): This service converts multiple address at the same time into 
their equivalent geocode coordinates (latitude and longitude) using 
Google Maps.

coordinates (and works for both Google and Bing).

BatchReverseGeocoding.php): This service converts geocode 
coordinate numbers from various coordinate systems to their 
equivalent approximate mailing address.
