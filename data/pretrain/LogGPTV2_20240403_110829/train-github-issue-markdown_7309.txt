I am using Symfony's DomCrawler to fetch an information from website.  
In one of the pages there is a text including non-html-encoded text like
following :
`Lorem ipsum > amet `  
And when I try to crawl the text from the `` tag using the
`filterXPath()->text()` method I get `Lorem ipsum filterXPath('my-xpath/a')->html(), I also get
broken html like following example :
Lorem ipsum >  
So, my question is if there is any way to get the "plain" text out of the node
?
