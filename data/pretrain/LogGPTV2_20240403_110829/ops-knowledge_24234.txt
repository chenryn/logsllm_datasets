Question: A user with a Microsoft Entra joined device is attempting to access corporate resources that require Kerberos authentication. Which of the following options accurately describes the sequence and methods used during the sign-in and resource access process?
"A": "The device uses the user's private key to sign a nonce received from Microsoft Entra ID, receives a PRT with a session key, and then leverages the TPM to protect the session key before authenticating to Active Directory using a cloud Kerberos trust.",
"B": "The device acquires a partial TGT from an on-premises AD FS server, then authenticates to Active Directory using a certificate-based Kerberos trust, and finally uses the partial TGT to request resources from Microsoft Entra ID.",
"C": "During sign-in, the device authenticates to Microsoft Entra ID and receives an encrypted PRT with session key, which is then decrypted with a transport key. For resource access, it uses metadata from the Windows Hello for Business key to locate a domain controller and sends a partial TGT to obtain a full TGT.",
"D": "The device bypasses Microsoft Entra ID authentication and directly connects to Active Directory using a self-signed certificate for Kerberos preauthentication, then retrieves a PRT from an on-premises domain controller to access the resource."
