### Effective Multi-Beam Channel Model

The effective multi-beam channel can be expressed as:
\[ h_{\text{eff}}(t) = \sum_{k} \alpha_k \delta(t - \tau_k) \]
where \(\alpha_k\) is a function of the transmitter and receiver beam patterns, and \(\tau_k\) represents the Time of Flight (ToF) for each multi-beam channel path. Our objective is to estimate the individual \(\alpha_k\) for each beam \(k = 1, \ldots, K\).

### Frequency-Selective Wideband System

For a frequency-selective wideband system, the received signal is sampled at a given sampling rate and sinc-interpolated due to limited bandwidth. The received signal can be represented as:
\[ h_{\text{eff}}[n] = \sum_{k} \alpha_k \text{sinc}\left(B(nT_s - \tau_k)\right) \]
where \(B\) is the bandwidth, \(T_s\) is the sampling period, and \(\alpha_k\) is the total signal attenuation along path \(k\).

### Optimization Problem Formulation

We can re-formulate the problem as an optimization task where our goal is to find \(\alpha_k\) such that it best fits the channel. Let the collected Channel Impulse Response (CIR) be represented by the column vector \(h_{\text{CIR}}\). We aim to solve the following optimization problem to extract \(\alpha = [\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_K]^T\), which represents the amplitude per beam:
\[ \alpha_{\text{est}} = \arg \min_{\alpha} \|h_{\text{CIR}} - S\alpha\|^2 + \lambda \|\alpha\|^2 \]
where \(S\) is a matrix consisting of all the ToF values. This optimization problem is convex with L2 norm regularization. Standard techniques [50, 51] are used to solve this problem in approximately 100 \(\mu s\).

### Key Observations and Algorithmic Enhancements

After training, the absolute ToF may change, but the relative ToF changes slowly. Our key idea is to shift the \(h_{\text{CIR}}\) so that the strongest path is shifted to zero delay. By knowing the relative delays, we can populate the \(S\) matrix with only a few columns, achieving accurate and reliable solutions for \(\alpha_k\). Small variations in relative ToF are accounted for by trying a few values around the initial value that best fits our model.

### Super-Resolution Algorithm

Our super-resolution algorithm leverages the initial relative ToF information between the multi-beams to achieve high resolution in estimating per-beam amplitudes. In Fig. 8(a), we demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve high resolution even when the relative ToF is lower than the resolution limit (2.5 ns for 400 MHz bandwidth). In Fig. 8(b), we show that our super-resolution can efficiently extract the two sinc functions superimposed in the received CIR.

### Generalization to Multi-Beam UE

So far, we have developed mmReliable for a quasi-omni beam pattern at the user equipment (UE). For scenarios requiring directional beams at the UE side, such as low SNR conditions for longer outdoor links, mmReliable extends naturally. The main challenge with directional UEs is misalignment due to mobility. In Fig. 9(a), we illustrate a scenario where the UE moves from \(t=0\) to \(t=t_0\), causing misalignments in the beams at both the gNB and UE. By estimating these misalignment angles, the beams can be realigned to mitigate the effects of mobility.

### Implementation Details

#### Phased Array and Beamforming

Our 8×8 phased array operates at 28 GHz with a 2 GHz bandwidth and includes amplifiers and image-reject filters. We use a Cinetics Axis-360 gantry system for precise movement. The beamforming control is managed by an Artix-7 FPGA, allowing high-speed and accurate timing over an SPI bus. Multi-beam weights are generated using simple addition and multiplication operations on the FPGA, requiring storage of only single-beam weights.

#### Baseband Module and 5G-NR Compliance

Our baseband module uses a 1 GSPs ADC/DAC and a KCU-105 FPGA to generate 400 MHz baseband OFDM waveforms. An off-the-shelf IF mixer up/down-converts to 3.5 GHz. For outdoor experiments, we use a USRP X300 with 100 MHz bandwidth. A host PC running MATLAB controls waveform generation, post-processing, and beamforming. Our system is 5G-NR compliant, using OFDM waveforms with 120 kHz sub-carrier spacing and leveraging CSI-RS for beam-maintenance.

### Evaluation

We evaluate mmReliable in various indoor and outdoor settings, including a 7m × 10m conference room and an outdoor 30m − 80m link. The Tx module acts as a fixed gNB, while the Rx module is movable. The phased array antenna of the Tx is kept vertical, facing the user. The precision gantry setup allows controlled experiments with linear motion and rotation. We report complex channel per sub-carrier, SNR, and throughput as performance metrics.

### Micro Benchmarks

#### Sensitivity Analysis of Multi-Beam

Accurate estimation of phase and amplitude provides the highest SNR, but the system is not very sensitive to estimation errors. In Fig. 11, we simulate a two-path channel and show the SNR gain for varying relative phase and amplitude. The highest SNR gain is 1.76 dB for perfect estimation, reducing gradually with increasing mismatch.

#### Constructive Combining Accuracy

We establish an indoor multi-beam link with two beams towards a static UE at 7 m. By performing an exhaustive scan of the second beam's phase, we observe that the SNR is maximized at 27 dB with minor variations within ±70°. Any phase estimate in this range provides a high SNR. However, a 180° phase error can cause significant SNR degradation.

### Conclusion

In summary, we have developed an accurate super-resolution algorithm and a robust user tracking mechanism to maintain high SNR and throughput in multi-beam systems. Our implementation and evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of mmReliable in both indoor and outdoor environments.
