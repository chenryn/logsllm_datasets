I have created a Docker image that includes Python libraries and Jupyter. I start the container using the `-p 8888:8888` option to map the ports between the host and the container. When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container, it runs on `localhost:8888`, but it cannot find a browser. I used the command `jupyter notebook`.

From my host machine, what IP address should I use to access Jupyter in my host's web browser? When I run the `ifconfig` command, I see interfaces like `eth0`, `docker0`, `wlan0`, and `lo`.

Thank you for your help!

To access the Jupyter notebook running inside the Docker container from your host machine, you need to use the IP address of your host machine. You can determine this by checking the output of the `ifconfig` command. Typically, the IP address you would use is associated with the `eth0` or `wlan0` interface, depending on whether you are connected via Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

For example, if the `ifconfig` output shows:
```
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.100  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
```
You would use `192.168.1.100:8888` in your host's web browser to access the Jupyter notebook.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to check the Jupyter configuration file inside the container. You can do this by running the following command inside the Docker container:
```sh
cat /etc/jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py
```
Ensure that the configuration file contains the following line to allow access from your host:
```python
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = 'https://colab.research.google.com'
```

This should help you access the Jupyter notebook from your host machine's web browser.
