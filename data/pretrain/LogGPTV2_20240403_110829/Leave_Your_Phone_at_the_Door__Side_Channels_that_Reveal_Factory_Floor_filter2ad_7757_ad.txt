experience with 3D printers or mills and no prior experience in au-
dio analysis. She prepared for her reconstruction tasks by watching
and listening to videos of a 3D printer and mill traversing a square,
circle, triangle, and turbine blade outline (see https://goo.gl/FijZ9T).
From examining the resulting spectrograms, she learned to reco-
gnize the visual signatures in the spectrogram corresponding to the
start and stop of the machine’s work on an object, the vertical bars

where the machine head changed its direction of travel, and tool
head up/down. She practiced by using the framework to reconstruct
the triangle and square made by the 3D printer and the mill; due
to angle ambiguities, her results included the actual objects as well
as their mirror reﬂections, which we ﬁnd acceptable for all recon-
structions. We anticipate that crowdsourced workers with the same
training as our user could segment the data equally well. To test this
claim, a second-year computer science undergraduate with no prior
experience with signal processing or audio also experimented with
segmenting, and found it easy.
We tested the reconstruction effectiveness on the 3D-printed out-
lines of a star, an airplane, and a gun. Our user had never seen any
of these designs before.
The resulting reconstructions, along with the original design, are
shown in Figures 13 and 14, and we discuss their accuracy below.
The user reconstructed all three objects, plus their mirror reﬂecti-
ons. However, she described the airplane, which was a B2 stealth
bomber, as a “ﬁsh mouth” and was quite dissatisﬁed with the result,
even revisiting the matched ﬁlter diagram to consider second-choice
values for angles and look for other potential reconstructions. In
other words, our user successfully reconstructed a mystery object,
even though the mystery object was not something she could reco-
gnize in real life so she was not assisted by context. For the gun, our
user reconstructed the original object, but did not a priori prefer it to
variants produced by mirroring the angles in the very short segments
of the gun.
Figure 15 shows the length of each side and degree of each angle
in the original and reconstructed objects. On average, angles are
within a degree of the actual.
For the mill, we correctly reconstructed all angles in a square
(not shown in the ﬁgure); for a triangle, we reconstructed one angle
exactly and the other two with 1 degree of error. The other objects
in the ﬁgure are from the 3D printer, and have similar accuracy in
angle reconstruction.
As we currently perform segmentation manually, error in com-
puting segment lengths is independent of the segment lengths and
reﬂects human judgment and focus. The framework’s user was off
by approximately 1mm on average in indicating segment lengths
for the plane and the star. This error could probably be reduced, as
our main concern was getting the angles right and slightly-too-short
segments do allow fully accurate angle reconstruction. We were
highly accurate in perimeter reconstruction, the measure used by [4].
However, this measure is quite sensitive to the segment lengths of
the target object, as the total error in manual segmentation is directly
proportional to the number of segments, rather than to their lengths.
Even with fully-automated reconstruction, non-expert users could
provide useful guidance during reconstruction. For example, we

could hear someone clicking a pen in one of the machine recordings.
The click was quite distinct from ordinary machine sounds, and we
knew that it did not indicate a machine event such as an angle change;
but signal processing techniques or a regression model might have
been fooled by it. More generally, when machine learning and signal
processing fail due to irrelevant background or foreground noise, a
human may be able to salvage the reconstruction.
5. RECOMMENDATIONS
We designed and tested a defense that obfuscates the acoustic
emissions from manufacturing equipment by playing recordings
during production. Since noise reduction has been studied extensive-
ly4, instead of playing a random signal, we chose to play recordings
of variations of the part being produced that have small dimensional
deviations from it. The attacker would still be able to determine the
general shape of item being manufactured, which may provide situa-
tional awareness about a manufacturer’s capabilities and the current
activities in their factory. On the other hand, obfuscation can make
it harder for the attacker to separate the target audio stream from
the others and reconstruct the object’s exact dimensions or process
parameters. Because often the small details of the process or design
are exactly the information that an attacker would like to obtain,
it is worthwhile to make them harder to identify. For example, in
high-value manufacturing, there may be a hundred wrong ways to
make an object and one way to make it correctly. Obfuscation could

audio was played while the eleventh proﬁle printed. Analysis of the
composite audio shows that while the fundamental frequencies were
reproduced, the harmonics were lost during the combination step. In
the eleventh recording, the fundamentals from the ﬁrst ten turbine
blades obscure the data necessary to reconstruct the eleventh, but
the harmonics from the eleventh appear clearly; this harmonic data
is sufﬁcient for an audio reconstruction. In future work, we will
experiment with combining the audio tracks in a way that preserves
the harmonics and matches other features such as amplitude, to
obfuscate the recording to a state that will signiﬁcantly raise the cost
of reconstruction.
Limiting the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by manufacturing
machinery can raise the cost of reconstruction by making it expen-
sive or impossible for reconstruction methods to determine which
quadrant an angle of travel lies in. Since magnetometer readings
drop off with the cube of the distance from the source, one opti-
on is to increase the size of a machine’s enclosure. We tested this
hypothesis with a large high-end new-model mill at the Digital Ma-
nufacturing Design and Innovation Institute, and found that when
the phone was placed on the machine’s enclosure, the magnetometer
was too far away from the motors to pick up useful readings.
When it is not practical to enlarge an enclosure, improving motor
shielding can help. For example, recent research on interference
shielding has shown that polymer-matrix composites are effective
for electromagnetic interference shielding due to their light weight,
resistance to corrosion, ﬂexibility, and modest cost. These composi-
tes have been used for many purposes (see, e.g., [8]). Additionally,
researchers have shown that composites such as carbon nanoﬁber-
polymer can provide effective shielding for the frequency range
of 8.2 − 12.4 GHz [25]. We suggest the use of composites to co-
ver the stepper motors in manufacturing equipment with a shield
thin enough that the motor is not damaged by excessive heat re-
tention, but thick enough to protect it from broadcasting sensitive
information to an adversary.
6. CONCLUSIONS
Factory ﬂoors produce vast quantities of proprietary data that
can be stolen by adversaries intent on learning about manufactu-
ring process speciﬁcations, product designs, and factory activities.
Nation-states’ activities to obtain this kind of information have
grown over the years, and attacks on the manufacturing sector have
become common. Using a CNC mill and a 3D printer to represent
subtractive and additive manufacturing, respectively, we demons-
trated that ordinary mobile phones can effectively capture these
machines’ acoustic and electromagnetic information on a factory
ﬂoor, and the recordings can be used to reconstruct the objects being
manufactured and the processes used to make them.
As both additive and subtractive manufacturing tend to be layer-
oriented, we adopted a layer-oriented approach to reconstruction,
using 3D printer data to reconstruct the shape and process informa-
tion for three previously unseen manufactured objects. Our method
uses signal processing and machine learning techniques, coupled
with an interactive framework that uses manufacturing domain cons-
traints and a non-expert human to help guide the reconstruction
process. Experiments showed that the method was highly accurate
in reconstructing a star, a gun, and an airplane shape from recor-
dings of a 3D printer, even though the human did not recognize the
airplane as such after reconstruction.
As mobile phones are ubiquitous, so is the potential for carrying
out phone-based attacks, regardless of the state of IT security in a
factory ﬂoor’s systems. Phone recordings may be made deliberately
by an attacker or inadvertently by an individual with a compromi-

constructed ﬁgures. The triangle is from the mill and the other
shapes are from the 3D printer.
greatly raise the cost of ﬁnding the right method, though this kind
of obfuscation has inherent limits: since every speaker has a unique
acoustic signature, in principle a set of played-back recordings could
be identiﬁed as such and peeled away, revealing the desired audio
within. However, if the obfuscation greatly increases the cost of the
attack, it will make many kinds of manufacturing espionage not
worth the price.
To test this hypothesis, we selected eleven similar turbine blade
proﬁles and scaled them so that the print time was approximately
the same. The ﬁrst ten were recorded as they printed individually.
The audio recordings from these prints were combined and aligned

Good audio data can even be captured in the background of a phone
call placed or received on the factory ﬂoor. For these reasons, we re-
commend that manufacturers consider obfuscating the side-channel
signals emanating from their equipment by playing audio recordings
of similar but ﬂawed processes and shielding tool head motors or
enlarging machines’ enclosures. Most importantly, manufacturers
should consider asking their employees and visitors to leave their
phones at the factory door.
