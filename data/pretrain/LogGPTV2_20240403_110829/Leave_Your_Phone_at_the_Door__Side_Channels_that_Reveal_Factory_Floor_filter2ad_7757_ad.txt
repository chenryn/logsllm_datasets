### User Experience and Preparation

The user had experience with 3D printers and mills but no prior experience in audio analysis. To prepare for her reconstruction tasks, she watched and listened to videos of a 3D printer and mill traversing various shapes, including a square, circle, triangle, and turbine blade outline (see [here](https://goo.gl/FijZ9T)). By examining the resulting spectrograms, she learned to recognize visual signatures corresponding to the start and stop of the machine's work on an object, vertical bars indicating changes in the direction of travel, and tool head up/down movements. She practiced by using the framework to reconstruct the triangle and square made by the 3D printer and the mill. Due to angle ambiguities, her results included both the actual objects and their mirror reflections, which we find acceptable for all reconstructions.

We anticipate that crowdsourced workers with the same training as our user could segment the data equally well. To test this, a second-year computer science undergraduate with no prior experience in signal processing or audio also experimented with segmentation and found it easy.

### Reconstruction Effectiveness

We tested the reconstruction effectiveness on 3D-printed outlines of a star, an airplane, and a gun. The user had never seen these designs before. The resulting reconstructions, along with the original designs, are shown in Figures 13 and 14. 

- **Airplane**: The user described the B2 stealth bomber as a "fish mouth" and was dissatisfied with the result, even revisiting the matched filter diagram to consider second-choice values for angles and look for other potential reconstructions. Despite this, she successfully reconstructed the mystery object, even though it was not something she could recognize in real life.
- **Gun**: The user reconstructed the original object but did not a priori prefer it to variants produced by mirroring the angles in the very short segments of the gun.

Figure 15 shows the length of each side and degree of each angle in the original and reconstructed objects. On average, the angles were within one degree of the actual values. For the mill, we correctly reconstructed all angles in a square (not shown in the figure); for a triangle, we reconstructed one angle exactly and the other two with a one-degree error. The other objects in the figure, from the 3D printer, had similar accuracy in angle reconstruction.

Currently, we perform segmentation manually, and errors in computing segment lengths reflect human judgment and focus. The user was off by approximately 1mm on average in indicating segment lengths for the plane and the star. This error could be reduced, as our main concern was getting the angles right, and slightly-too-short segments still allow fully accurate angle reconstruction. We were highly accurate in perimeter reconstruction, as measured by [4]. However, this measure is sensitive to the segment lengths of the target object, as the total error in manual segmentation is directly proportional to the number of segments, rather than their lengths.

Even with fully-automated reconstruction, non-expert users could provide useful guidance. For example, we heard someone clicking a pen in one of the machine recordings. The click was distinct from ordinary machine sounds and did not indicate a machine event such as an angle change. Signal processing techniques or a regression model might have been fooled by it. More generally, when machine learning and signal processing fail due to irrelevant background or foreground noise, a human may be able to salvage the reconstruction.

### Recommendations

We designed and tested a defense that obfuscates the acoustic emissions from manufacturing equipment by playing recordings during production. Since noise reduction has been extensively studied, we chose to play recordings of variations of the part being produced that have small dimensional deviations from it. The attacker would still be able to determine the general shape of the item being manufactured, providing situational awareness about a manufacturer’s capabilities and current activities. However, obfuscation can make it harder for the attacker to separate the target audio stream and reconstruct the object’s exact dimensions or process parameters. Because the small details of the process or design are often the information an attacker wants, making them harder to identify is worthwhile.

For example, in high-value manufacturing, there may be many wrong ways to make an object and only one correct way. Obfuscation can significantly raise the cost of reconstruction. In future work, we will experiment with combining audio tracks in a way that preserves harmonics and matches other features such as amplitude, to obfuscate the recording further.

### Limiting Electromagnetic Fields

Limiting the electromagnetic field generated by manufacturing machinery can also raise the cost of reconstruction. Magnetometer readings drop off with the cube of the distance from the source. One option is to increase the size of a machine’s enclosure. We tested this hypothesis with a large, high-end new-model mill at the Digital Manufacturing Design and Innovation Institute and found that placing the phone on the machine’s enclosure made the magnetometer too far away from the motors to pick up useful readings.

When it is not practical to enlarge an enclosure, improving motor shielding can help. Recent research on interference shielding has shown that polymer-matrix composites are effective for electromagnetic interference shielding due to their light weight, resistance to corrosion, flexibility, and modest cost. These composites have been used for various purposes. Additionally, researchers have shown that composites such as carbon nanofiber-polymer can provide effective shielding for the frequency range of 8.2–12.4 GHz. We suggest using composites to cover the stepper motors in manufacturing equipment, with a shield thin enough to prevent excessive heat retention but thick enough to protect against broadcasting sensitive information to an adversary.

### Conclusions

Factory floors produce vast quantities of proprietary data that can be stolen by adversaries intent on learning about manufacturing process specifications, product designs, and factory activities. Nation-states' activities to obtain this kind of information have grown over the years, and attacks on the manufacturing sector have become common. Using a CNC mill and a 3D printer to represent subtractive and additive manufacturing, respectively, we demonstrated that ordinary mobile phones can effectively capture these machines’ acoustic and electromagnetic information on a factory floor, and the recordings can be used to reconstruct the objects being manufactured and the processes used to make them.

As both additive and subtractive manufacturing tend to be layer-oriented, we adopted a layer-oriented approach to reconstruction, using 3D printer data to reconstruct the shape and process information for three previously unseen manufactured objects. Our method uses signal processing and machine learning techniques, coupled with an interactive framework that uses manufacturing domain constraints and a non-expert human to guide the reconstruction process. Experiments showed that the method was highly accurate in reconstructing a star, a gun, and an airplane shape from recordings of a 3D printer, even though the human did not recognize the airplane as such after reconstruction.

Given the ubiquity of mobile phones, the potential for phone-based attacks is significant, regardless of the state of IT security in a factory floor’s systems. Phone recordings may be made deliberately by an attacker or inadvertently by an individual with a compromised application on their phone or other microphone-enabled device. Good audio data can even be captured in the background of a phone call placed or received on the factory floor. For these reasons, we recommend that manufacturers consider obfuscating the side-channel signals emanating from their equipment by playing audio recordings of similar but flawed processes and shielding tool head motors or enlarging machines’ enclosures. Most importantly, manufacturers should consider asking their employees and visitors to leave their phones at the factory door.
