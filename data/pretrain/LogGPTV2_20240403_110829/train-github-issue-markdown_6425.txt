The code snippets in https://flutter.io/cookbook/ currently have 754 analyzer
errors [1]. We should clean up those errors and then enforce that the code
stays clean by including the cookbook in our travis check [2].
This will also ensure that the code in the cookbook doesn't go stale with new
Flutter/Dart releases.
