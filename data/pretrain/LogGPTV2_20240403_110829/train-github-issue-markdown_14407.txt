Please help, the site changes and loads behind the menu bar, the "x" button
will not close the side bar. True for all safari, bing, chrome, and even using
browsec Vpn. Not sure what could be causing this. Wanted to practice waypoints
on the phone away from desktop to continue JavaScript lessons.
P.s. Displayed fine before January 13 approximately. Thanks.
