Subject: Issue with Website Sidebar and Menu Bar

Dear Support Team,

I am experiencing a problem with the website where the content changes and loads behind the menu bar. Additionally, the "X" button to close the sidebar is not functioning. This issue persists across multiple browsers, including Safari, Bing, Chrome, and even when using Browsec VPN.

I was hoping to practice waypoints on my mobile device to continue my JavaScript lessons, but this issue is preventing me from doing so. The display was working correctly until around January 13th.

Thank you for your assistance in resolving this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
