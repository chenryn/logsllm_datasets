Abstract—Our work demonstrates a new set of silent recon-
naissance attacks, which leverages the presence of commodity
WiFi devices to track users inside private homes and ofﬁces,
without compromising any WiFi network, data packets, or
devices. We show that just by snifﬁng existing WiFi signals, an
adversary can accurately detect and track movements of users
inside a building. This is made possible by our new signal model
that links together human motion near WiFi transmitters and
variance of multipath signal propagation seen by the attacker
sniffer outside of the property. The resulting attacks are cheap,
highly effective, and yet difﬁcult to detect. We implement the
attack using a single commodity smartphone, deploy it in 11 real-
world ofﬁces and residential apartments, and show it is highly
effective. Finally, we evaluate potential defenses, and propose a
practical and effective defense based on AP signal obfuscation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
With near-ubiquitous deployment of WiFi-enabled smart
devices (e.g., security cameras, voice assistants, and smart
appliances), our homes and ofﬁces are ﬁlled with many WiFi
devices1. The ubiquity of these devices and their sheer density
means that they will ﬁll the air around us with radio frequency
(RF) signals, wherever we go.
Unfortunately, the RF signals emitted by these devices pose
a real security and privacy risk to all of us. They are constantly
interacting with (e.g., reﬂecting off) our bodies, carrying infor-
mation about our location, movement and other physiological
properties to anyone nearby with sufﬁcient knowledge and
curiosity. In this work, we explore a new set of passive
reconnaissance attacks that leverages the presence of ambient
WiFi signals to monitor users in their homes and ofﬁces,
even when the WiFi network, data packets, and individual
devices are completely secured and operating as expected. We
show that by just snifﬁng existing WiFi signals, an adversary
outside of the target property can accurately detect and track
movements of any users down to their individual rooms,
regardless of whether they are carrying any networked devices.
We believe this is the ﬁrst
in a new class of silent
reconnaissance attacks that are notable because of their passive

nature and general applicability. This attack can be highly
effective, incurs low cost (only cheap commodity hardware),
and yet remains undetectable. The attacker does not need to
compromise/access the WiFi network or individual devices,
decode packets or transmit any signals. All they need is to
place a single, off-the-shelf, minimally equipped WiFi receiver
outside of the target property. This attacker receiver only needs
a single antenna, and simply measures the signal strength of
existing WiFi signals, without decoding any packets.
Unaddressed, these reconnaissance attacks put our security
and privacy at signiﬁcant risk. The ability for an attacker to
continuously and automatically scan, detect and locate humans
behind walls at nearly no cost and zero risk (e.g. attacker
waits for notiﬁcations remotely) will enable attackers to launch
strong physical attacks and commit serious crimes. Such threat
broadly applies to our homes, businesses, government facilities
and many others. Examples include burglary to homes and
ofﬁces, kidnapping and assault of targets in their homes,
“casing” a bank prior to robbery, and even planning attacks
against government agencies.
Why WiFi sensing? We note that there are some simple
approaches to inferring user presence that do not require the
use of sophisticated RF sensing. For example, attackers could
infer user presence by observing lighting or acoustic conditions
inside an area, or use thermal imaging. These attacks are well
understood and easily disrupted by time-controlled lighting
or sound systems [3], or insulated walls designed to prevent
heat leakage and naturally block thermal imaging [1]. Finally,
attackers can infer user presence from increased WiFi network
trafﬁc. Yet this is highly unreliable, as growth of IoT devices
increases trafﬁc levels in the absence of users. It is also easily
thwarted using cover trafﬁc [15].
Instead, we describe a new class of physical reconnaissance
attacks enabled by inherent properties of WiFi signal propa-
gation: 1) user movement near a WiFi transmitter changes its
signal propagation in a way that can be observed by nearby
receivers, and 2) walls and buildings today are not built to
insulate against WiFi signals, thus signals sent by devices
inside a property can often be overheard by outside receivers.
Leveraging these, we design the attack such that, whenever
a WiFi device transmits signals, it unknowingly turns into a
tracking device for our attack. In this context, our attack could
be viewed as an adversarial analogy to WiFi-based device-free
human sensing (e.g., see-through-wall systems that actively
transmit customized RF signals towards the target [14]). Yet
our attack differs signiﬁcantly (§II), because we use a novel
model on multipath signal dynamics to remove dependence
on active transmissions (only passive sensing), customized
hardware (only a commodity, single antenna receiver), and
knowing precise locations of WiFi devices inside the property.
Motion detection via multipath signal dynamics. The core
of our attack is a new model on signal dynamics that links
together human motion near WiFi transmitters and variance of
multipath signal propagation seen by a sniffer outside of the
property. Speciﬁcally, when a human target moves (e.g., sitting
down, walking, opening/closing doors) near a WiFi device x,
the motion changes the multipath signal propagation from x
to the attacker sniffer S. Our new signal model allows S
to accurately capture such signal dynamics and use them to
pinpoint the target to her speciﬁc room. The more WiFi devices
inside the property, the more accurate the tracking becomes.
Our proposed attack does not assume any prior knowledge
of the WiFi network and devices inside the target property,
including their locations. Our attack can discover devices and
estimate their coarse locations using their WiFi signals, and the
attack continues to function even if these devices are relocated.
We build a complete prototype of the attacker system
on commodity smartphones, and experimentally show that
the attack (using a single smartphone) is not only highly
accurate (detecting and localizing users to an individual room),
but also highly general (effective across a wide range of 11
different physical settings, including both ofﬁce buildings and
residential apartments).
Defense via AP-based signal obfuscation. We explore
robust defenses against our proposed attack and other pas-
sive sensing attacks. We consider four immediate defenses:
reducing leakage by geo-fencing and rate limiting, signal
obfuscation by MAC randomization, and power randomization
at WiFi devices, and ﬁnd that they are either impractical or
ineffective. We then propose a practical alternative using AP-
based signal obfuscation, where the WiFi Access Point actively
injects customized cover signal for its associated devices. This
defense effectively creates noise to the signal measurements,
such that the attacker is unable to identify change due to human
motion. Our defense is easy to implement, incurs no changes
to devices other than the AP, but reduces the human detection
rate to 47% while increasing the false positive rate to 50%.
Such ambiguity renders the attack useless in practice.
In the rest of the paper, we describe our efforts to under-
stand the feasibility, challenges, and defenses surrounding the
proposed attack. In short, our key contributions include:
• We identify a low-cost, undetectable human sensing attack
using just a single sniffer with a single antenna, and design
a new multipath signal variance model for motion detection.
• We prototype the attacker system on a commodity smart-
phone and validate the attack in real-world settings.
• We propose and evaluate a practical and effective defense
using AP-based signal obfuscation.
Limitations.
Currently, our attack detects human presence
in each room over time by detecting and localizing targets to
individual rooms. It is unable to identify ﬁne-grained features
such as speed, activity type and user identity, or separate
humans from large animals. Despite such limitations, our work
identiﬁes a realistic, low-cost, and undetectable reconnaissance
attack using passive WiFi sensing. We hope our work brings
more attention to this important and understudied topic.

II. BACKGROUND: DEVICE-FREE HUMAN SENSING
Some details of adversarial sensing attacks are reminiscent
of the problem of “device-free human sensing.” A natural
question is: can we simply reuse existing work on device-free
human sensing systems to launch adversarial sensing attacks?
To answer this question, and to better understand how these
attacks in the context of prior work, we review in detail existing
works in device-free human sensing.
The task of “device-free human sensing” makes no as-
sumptions on whether targets are carrying networked devices.
Sensing is generally achieved by capturing and analyzing RF
signals reﬂected off or blocked by human bodies. To be clear,
this is quite different from the task of “device localization,”
in which the target is a networked device that communicates
and synchronizes with the sensing system, i.e. sending and/or
receiving signals (e.g., [69], [33], [74], [16], [21]).
Existing works on device-free human sensing can be cate-
gorized into two broad groups: active mode and passive mode.
Active sensing. Most of the existing works fall into this
group, where the sensing device continuously transmits RF
signals towards the target area (Figure 1a). As some signals get
reﬂected off the target body, they are captured by the sensing
device to infer the target status (e.g., [14], [13], [63], [71]). To
facilitate sensing/inference, the RF signals are often custom-
designed to capture information of the target, e.g., frequency-
modulated continuous wave (FMCW) signal [14], [13] that
largely differs from WiFi transmissions. We note that some
prior works on active sensing (e.g., [26], [47], [73]) are branded
as “passive sensing” to refer to device-free human sensing,
although their sensing device is actively transmitting signals.
When considering our adversarial scenario in the context
of active sensing, the key property is “detectability.” Since the
attacker device must continuously transmit RF signals, it is
easy to detect, localize and remove these devices.
Passive sensing.
In a passive mode, sensing devices only
listen to existing transmission signals, but do not transmit
signals themselves. They have no control of the RF signal
used for sensing. The state-of-the-art design [63] deploys
multiple sniffers to listen to WiFi signals sent by multiple
transmitters in the target area, and uses these signals to detect
and estimate user location. Speciﬁcally, when a user blocks the
2
direct line of sight (LoS) path from a transmitter to a sniffer,
the original signal will diffuse around the user. By building
a precise propagation model on signal diffusion on the LoS
path, [63] is able to derive the user location. However, doing
so requires precise location of the transmitters (cm-level). Such
requirement is impractical under our adversarial scenario.
Similarly, an earlier work [17] detects the presence of a
user when she disturbs the direct path between a WiFi access
point (AP) and a sniffer. Again, the attacker must obtain AP
locations a priori, and must deploy multiple sniffers around
the target area to detect user presence (see Figure 1b).
Key observation. While some existing human sensing
systems can be turned into attacks, they impose a hefty cost
and risk for the attacker, signiﬁcantly limiting the applicability
of the attack. This motivates us to consider a new, passive
human sensing attack that can be launched by a minimally
equipped attacker and remains undetectable. Along these lines,
our proposed attack only requires a single commodity WiFi
receiver (with a single antenna) outside of the target area
(Figure 1c). As we will explain in §IV, this is made possible
by building a new model to detect motion using dynamics of
multipath signal propagation from each anchor to the sniffer,
rather than those of the direct path as in [63], [17].
III. ATTACK SCENARIO AND ADVERSARIAL MODEL
We start by describing the attack scenario, the adversarial
model, and the type of signals captured by the attacker sniffer.
Attack scenario: one sniffer and many anchors. As shown
in Figure 1c, our attack leverages the ubiquity of commodity
WiFi devices, ranging from routers, desktops, printers,
to
IoT devices like voice assistants, security cameras, and smart
appliances. These devices are often spread over each room
of our homes and ofﬁces [11], [10], and generally ﬂood the
surroundings with periodic WiFi packets. We refer to these
WiFi devices as anchors in our attack.
Our attack also leverages the fact that WiFi signals are
designed for signiﬁcant coverage and can penetrate most walls.
Thus an attacker can place a sniffer outside the target property
to passively listen to existing signals sent by anchors, without
compromising them or the network. Because WiFi protocols
do not encrypt source and destination MAC addresses, the
sniffer can isolate packets sent by each anchor, even under
MAC randomization [51], [56], [41].
Our attack is effective if the sniffer can capture signals from
at least one anchor per room of interest. The actual number of
sniffers required depends on the size and shape of the target
property and wall materials. Across all of our experiments with
11 ofﬁce buildings, residential apartments and single family
houses (described later in §V-B), a single sniffer is sufﬁcient
to cover our target scene.
Our attack does not work when WiFi signals do not leak
to outside of the property, e.g. when the property has thick,
concrete exterior walls. The attacker can detect this (and walk
away) when either the sniffer sees too little WiFi signals, or
the detected anchors are outside of the target area (§V-B).
• The adversary makes no assumptions about the number,
location, or movement speed of human targets being tracked.
• The adversary does not have physical or remote access to
WiFi devices in the target property, or the property itself.
• Similar
to the evil maid attack [2],
the attacker can
physically move outside the target property, either outside
exterior walls or along public corridors, without attracting
suspicion. This temporary access is necessary only for initial
bootstrapping the attack, and not required for the prolonged
sensing phase.
• To avoid detection, the attacker only performs passive WiFi
snifﬁng, and avoids using any bulky or specialized hardware,
e.g. directional antennas, antenna arrays, or USRP radios [8].
Instead, they use commodity mobile or IoT devices, e.g.
smartphones or smart street lights. The sniffer device only
needs a single (built-in) antenna.
Note that while some smartphones (including the ones
used in our attack implementation) have multiple antennas,
their ﬁrmware only exposes aggregate signal received across
multiple antennas, effectively giving the same amount of
information as devices with a single antenna.
• The adversary partitions the target property into “regions”
or virtual rooms around the anchors to detect user presence.
When the adversary has access to rough ﬂoor plans of the
target property2, the attacker detects user presence down to
their individual rooms.
We intentionally choose a resource-limited attacker to
demonstrate the generality of this attack. Lower resource
requirements imply that the attack can be successful in a wider
range of practical scenarios.
For each anchor x, the
Signals captured by the sniffer.
sniffer S can extract two metrics from x’s raw WiFi signals
(even if the packets are encrypted). The ﬁrst is amplitude of
channel state information (aCSI) that measures the received
signal strength (RSS) on each of the many frequency subcar-
riers used in a transmission. Since human movements change
the multipath signal propagation from x to S, x’s aCSI values
seen by S will ﬂuctuate over time. The second one is RSS, or
the aggregated aCSIs over all the subcarriers. This aggregation
makes RSS relatively insensitive to human movements.
A passive sniffer with a single antenna is unable to extract
advanced signal features including phase of CSI (fCSI), Angle
of Arrival (AoA) and Time of Flight (ToF) [29], [47]. Tracking
fCSI and ToF requires the sniffer to actively synchronize with
the transmitter [62], and estimating AoA requires the sniffer to
have an antenna array [69], [30]. As mentioned earlier, while
some smartphones are equipped with multiple antennas, their
ﬁrmware only reports a single effective CSI but not per-antenna
CSI values. Furthermore, AoA estimation requires antennas to
be separated by half a wavelength (12.5cm for WiFi). Thus
a reasonable array of 4 antennas will be at least 19cm in
width. These physical limitations rule out the feasibility of
using phase, ToF and AoA in our sensing design.
Adversarial model. We make the following assumptions
about the adversary.
