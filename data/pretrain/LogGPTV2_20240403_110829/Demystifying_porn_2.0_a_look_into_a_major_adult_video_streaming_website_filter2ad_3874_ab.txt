sons for this style of viewing could be diverse, it is important to
note that Alexa reports the average viewing time on YouPorn as
only ≈9 minutes [1]. With such time limitations, uploaders (partic-
ularly commercial ones) must ensure that only the most interesting
elements of their ﬁlms are seen by viewers. Lastly, Figure 1 also
shows the duration of videos weighted by the number of times they
are watched. The curves are near identical, indicating that users do
not have a particular preference for one duration but, rather, watch
various durations equally often.
4.2 Content injection
An extremely important component of Porn 2.0 is the injection
of content by users. We therefore inspect the frequency at which
videos are uploaded into the corpus. Indeed, the short durations of
the videos could come with signiﬁcant churn to sustain the interest
of the user base. Figure 2 ﬁrst provides a CDF of the number of
daily video uploads. On average, only 78 videos are added per day,
a surprisingly modest ﬁgure compared to sites such as YouTube [4].
This low daily injection rate therefore suggests that rapid corpus
expansion is not necessarily vital for the success of this platform.
As a comparison, already in 2008, YouTube was reported to have
well over 140 million videos — over 700 times more than You-
Porn’s current corpus of 183,639 videos. Despite this, according
1Some videos had bogus length ﬁelds (e.g., 1000 hours). Con-
sequently, we manually removed all entries above 3 hours (74
videos), leaving 99.99% of the videos in the trace.

to Alexa, the number of pageviews for YouTube is just 100 times
more than for YouPorn. This suggests that sheer volume of content
is not necessary for the success of adult video streaming services.
That said, Figure 2 does highlight that the number of daily uploads
has increased notably over time, with an average rate of about 140
over the last 3 months of the trace.
Beyond these absolute ﬁgures, we also examine who uploads
content. We ﬁnd that only 5, 849 distinct usernames have ever up-
loaded over the entire 6 year history of YouPorn. Note this includes
“Unknown” users with anonymous uploads (33k videos). Further-
more, as indicated in Figure 3, most users (56%) upload only a
single video, with the majority (80%) uploading at most 5. Fig-
ure 3 also presents the number of submissions per user in the “am-

more proactive user-base. Even this category, however, shows very
few uploads. In fact, overall, we observe 75 days during which no
content was uploaded whatsoever.
This observation led us to perform manual inspection to better
understand the nature of the uploads. We found that many uploads
were actually provided by commercial producers. This observation
extends to all categories, even “amateur”. Figure 4 presents the
daily upload rates over the entirety of YouPorn’s existence. An up-
wards trend can be seen, suggesting an expanding base of upload-
ers. Investigation of these uploaders shows that 36% of the con-
tent is actually uploaded by YouPorn itself; a process that started
almost 2 years after YouPorn’s inception, with 39 videos, on aver-
age, being injected each day. These are all professional videos that
are typically produced by a listed production studio. We conjec-
ture that this may have been initiated, in part, to ensure a sufﬁcient
number of daily uploads. Regardless of the underlying reason, af-
ter YouPorn started uploading content, we observe that every day
has new uploads, showing that YouPorn’s own contributions have
had a signiﬁcant impact. In fact, without these contributions, the
overall average daily upload rates would drop massively from 78
to 50 video per day. This can be seen in Figure 4 with extremely
predictable and sustained upload rates boosting the overall uploads
after year 2. Our observations therefore suggest that YouPorn is
closer to a commercial platform than a user generated one.
tus page, allowing us to ascertain the current status of each video
upload.
Figure 5 shows the number of removals we observed across the
measured identiﬁer space. On average, we found that 11.7% of
the content is removed. A number of notable spikes can also be
seen; for example, we found that all videos were removed from
a speciﬁc 1k identiﬁer block. Manual inspection revealed many
videos with production studios in their titles, suggesting possible
copyright issues.
From this, one might assume that the majority of videos become
active in the repository. However, we discovered other possible
video statuses beyond “active” and “removed”. We found a large
number of videos that were classiﬁed as being “processed”2. This
state is allocated to a video during the initial stages of its life when
it is being encoded. It is therefore curious as to why many videos
do not proceed beyond this state; on average, 61% of videos are
still being processed even after several months of existence. We
strongly suspect that some sort of (potentially manual) vetting pro-
cedure takes place. Consequently, only a minority of uploads are
actually accepted for publication on YouPorn: only 18% of videos
are active in the identiﬁer range we studied. This also offers some
explanation as to why the injection rates in YouPorn (particularly
historic ones) are lower than could be expected for a repository of
its prominence. Further, the need to vet content might also offer
insight into why YouPorn started to upload a large number of its
own videos.
Figure 4: Breakdown for daily Upload rates (with and without
YouPorn’s contributions): During the ﬁrst two years of You-
Porn’s existence, there were days without any new uploads. Af-
ter this YouPorn itself has been uploading new videos, leading
to a notable increase in the number of new uploads, suggesting
that much of the content is not user-generated.
4.3 Content removal
So far, we have seen the number of videos added to YouPorn
each day. An equally important aspect is how many videos are re-
moved. Unlike most user generated content sites, YouPorn does not
offer a straightforward way for users to remove their own content
after upload. Instead, all removals must be requested — measuring
removal levels therefore provides strong insight into the amount of
content that deviates from YouPorn’s policies (e.g., copyright is-
sues).
YouPorn allocates each video a unique numerical identiﬁer. These
are selected from an incrementing pool of time-dependent iden-
tiﬁers. We surveyed a large range of the identiﬁer space to col-
lect the status of each video therein. We incrementally crawled all
video identiﬁers between 7, 692, 093 and 8, 300, 674 in 1K blocks;
this range covers March 2012–2013. Each identiﬁer returns a sta-
Figure 5: Removal rate of content.
4.4 Summary
We conclude that the users of such services do not particularly
require huge novelty from the content available to them. It seems
that a small number of new videos will still satisfy the demand.
However, from the daily video uploads, it seems that the current
user base requires new content to be available every day, forcing
YouPorn to ensure a steady ﬂow. Amongst the uploaded videos,
only a limited fraction become available eventually with ≈ 10%
removed.
5. CONTENT POPULARITY
We have seen that YouPorn is a constantly expanding repository,
with new (typically short) videos being uploaded on a daily basis.
Next, it is important to understand the way in which users interact
with this corpus. Particularly, we are interested in seeing the pop-

ularity of individual objects, as indicated by the number of views
they receive, and their respective importance in YouPorn.
5.1 Popularity: I’ll take anything you’ve got
We begin by looking at the popularity of all videos taken within
our traces. We rely on two different time windows: (i) the entirety
of YouPorn’s existence (cumulative) and (ii) a three day period.
One recurrent property that has been observed across many types
of content repositories is a Zipf-like popularity distribution, evi-
denced by a straight line on a log-log plot. Figure 6 presents the
number of views per video, on a log-log plot (ordered by rank) for
both time windows. We observe a distinctive popularity skew, but
not a straight line as one would expect from a Zipf distribution.
We make two complementary observations from Figure 6. First,
the skew towards the “head” (or popular part) of the corpus is
far less than has been previously observed in other UGC corpora.
Speciﬁcally, the top 10% of YouPorn videos receive only 65% of
the views. In comparison, the top 10% of videos generate 80% of
views on YouTube [13], and 82% of views on Vimeo [33]. Second,
the “tail” (or unpopular part) are correspondingly more popular.
Nearly 93% of YouPorn’s videos receive at least 10k views over
their lifetime when inspecting the snapshot trace. In comparison,
only 1.9% of videos on Vimeo generate more than 10k views. Fur-
ther into the “tail”, all videos in the YouPorn catalogue have at least
226 views, whereas fewer than 47% of Vimeo videos have at least
200 views.
Two explanations are possible. One possibility is that videos up-
loaded to YouPorn are generally of a higher quality than on other
UGC sites; indeed, manual inspection reveals a wealth of profes-
sionally produced content. As such, a higher quality could encour-
age users to view a more diverse body of content. A second possi-
bility is that users have a greater ﬂexibility in their content selection
requirements, i.e., users are not particularly selective in what they
choose to watch, thereby resulting in views being more evenly dis-
tributed. Our user study (Section 7) suggests that the latter may
well be true, with many users having far looser interest constraints
than traditionally understood. For example, in mainstream VoD
services, users often have relatively tight constraints on what they
wish to watch. This might be a certain programme, a serialised TV
show, or a particular genre [29]. Without these constraints, how-
ever, much larger sets of objects become acceptable for consump-
tion, leading to a lesser skew in the popularity.
That said, ﬂexibility does not explain the skew - if content selec-
tion were entirely ﬂexible, why do some objects gain more views?
One cause could be the way viewers discover content to watch.
For instance, users of other user-generated video corpora such as
YouTube may have particular videos in mind, driven by URL links
from other websites, such as social networks. It is believed that
up to 45% of requests to YouTube come from social sources [38].
Similarly, Borghol et al. [10] found that an uploader’s social net-
work (on YouTube) is one of the strongest predictors of video pop-
ularity. In contrast, users are less likely to share YouPorn links on
social networks such as Facebook, or even discuss speciﬁc videos
with friends. We conjecture that a lack of external referrals from
other websites helps create an information bottleneck that prevents
users from discovering the exact URLs corresponding to individ-
ual videos, thereby forcing most viewers to ﬁnd videos through
YouPorn’s built-in facilities (like browsing or search). When com-
bined with the inherent user ﬂexibility, this likely predisposes any
“generic” user to retrieve content from the easiest source possible,
e.g., front-page listings.
To verify the above assertions, we correlate the number of views
a video receives with the default front page browsing order. Fig-
ure 7 presents the outputs of this analysis for the 3 day trace. We
observe that the majority of views do, indeed, come from easy to
access items. On average, videos on the front page3 achieve 55k
views, compared to an average of 9k for the top 30 pages. These
can then be both contrasted with the overall average of just 603
views per video.
Our observations reﬂect well the type of behaviour one would
expect from such a content repository. With a corpus in which it
is difﬁcult to differentiate objects, it is likely that only the most
dedicated viewers (e.g., ones with special interests) would take the
effort to ﬁnd particular items of interest. More generic viewers
seek easy access content, which, of course, creates a certain level
of skew because all users are presented with the same easy access
content items. However, due to the churn of the content, these ob-
jects are quickly pushed from the front pages, thereby ﬂattening the
popularity distribution into the one shown in Figure 6.
5.2 Popularity: But now I’ve changed my mind
Next, we look at how video popularity evolves over time, driven
by regular content injection (Section 4.2) and what appears to be a
largely ﬂexible and browsing-driven user base (Section 5.1).
To gain insight into how videos accumulate views over time, we
look at the distribution of views based on a content item’s age. Fig-
ure 8 presents a log-log plot of the number of views per video,
ranked by popularity. Each curve shows the distribution of videos
with a given age (note that the tails are different due to a varying
number of videos being uploaded on those individual days). We
3This is a conservative estimate as we do not include “featured”
videos, which receive a more prominent status on the front page.

ﬁnd that videos uploaded a long time (e.g., a year) ago have not
received particularly more views than recently uploaded ones. This
is in stark contrast to prior UGC studies (e.g., [13, 37]) that show
far greater cumulative views for older videos.
To explore this, we inspect the 3 days traces to ascertain the
most popular content ages during this short period. There is a dis-
tinct preference for recently uploaded videos. Content that was
uploaded on the same day as the snapshot trace had collected on
average 28k views, in contrast to an average of only 584 views for
all other content ages. That said, we ﬁnd notable exceptions: the
content age with the third highest average number of views is 6
years, suggesting that there is no inherent reason why older con-
tent would not be suitable for viewing today. Note that browsing
options (e.g., “most viewed”) make such videos easy to ﬁnd.
To understand how the characteristics of particular videos af-
fect this rapid aging process, we inspect the daily traces, which
show how the popularity of individual videos evolve over a more
extended period of time. First, we partition videos into popular-
ity groups based on the number of views they receive during their
ﬁrst day. We then average the number of views per day received
by each video, and normalise that as a fraction of their total view
count. Figure 9 presents the results. We observe a sharp decline in
the number of views per day across all popularity groups, with the
biggest decrease occurring after the second day.
We now draw a conclusion. Continuing from the discussions in
Section 5.1, we see that the previously discussed user ﬂexibility
and browsing behaviour has a direct (and perhaps damaging) effect
on temporal trends. YouPorn displays content on its front page in
order of upload date (and then rating), thereby making more recent
content easiest to ﬁnd. Accessing content older than one day re-
quires browsing through ≈4–5 pages of listings, a process which
many users may ﬁnd cumbersome.
typical YouPorn videos into the category of junk. These are videos
that experience a short burst of activity, followed by a popularity
collapse. In comparison, such videos belong to the smallest cate-
gory of YouTube videos [18, 32].
Therefore, YouPorn videos seem to have developed temporal
properties similar to news and weather shows [6], which are highly
temporally dependent (e.g., weather forecasts from the previous
day are rarely of interest). However, contrary to news and weather
content, there is no temporal dependency in adult content — videos
created a year ago would still seem to be suitable for viewing today.
Instead, it seems that this behaviour is formed from user ﬂexibility:
many videos meet the content consumption requirements of most
users and, hence, are readily satisﬁed with the age-based listing on
the front page.
