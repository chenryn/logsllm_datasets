User: I need to test my Python package if it works properly on different systems. I found Tox for different Python versions, but what about different operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac. 
Can you recommend me a convenient way to test if my code works on all systems?
Assistant: You can use travis to run tests on linux, mac and windows. Travis supports these platforms. This is the most convenient option. If the repo is open source, travis is free.
