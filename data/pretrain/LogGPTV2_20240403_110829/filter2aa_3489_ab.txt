### 1. App Discovery / App Guessing
To identify the application version, we need a small set of files that are present in every release. Here are some examples:

- `/includes/js/dtree/img/frontpage.gif` (Present in 29 versions)
- `/images/banners/osmbanner2.png` (Present in 33 versions)
- `/media/system/js/mootools.js` (Present in 18 versions)
- `/includes/js/wz_tooltip.js` (Present in 29 versions)

### 2. Indicator Files
These files indicate the presence of a specific version of an application. For example, if the file `/includes/js/dtree/img/frontpage.gif` is found, it suggests that the application is some version of Joomla.

### 3. Supporting a New App
To support a new application, follow these steps:

1. **Collect Versions**: Gather as many versions of the application as possible and place them in a directory.
2. **Exclude Files/Directories** (Optional): Use a regular expression to exclude certain directories or files from fingerprinting (e.g., `.php` files, protected admin directories, `.htaccess`, etc.).
3. **Build Datafiles**: Use BlindElephant to generate the necessary datafiles.
4. **Fingerprint**: Run the fingerprinting process.
5. **Evaluate Results**: Review the results to determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the fingerprinting.

### 4. Testing the Tool
Let's test the tool with MovableType on the website `http://laws.qualys.com`.

```bash
$ ./BlindElephant.py http://laws.qualys.com movabletype
```

**Output:**
- **Loaded**: 96 versions, 2229 differentiating paths, and 209 version groups.
- **Starting Fingerprint**: for MovableType at `http://laws.qualys.com`.

**Hits and Possible Versions:**
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/mt.js`
  - Possible versions: 4.2-en, 4.21-en, 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/js/tc/client.js`
  - Possible versions: 4.2-en, 4.21-en, 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/css/main.css`
  - Possible versions: 4.2-en, 4.21-en, 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/tools/run-periodic-tasks`
  - Error: 404 (Not Found)

**Additional Hits:**
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/js/tc/tagcomplete.js`
  - Possible versions: 4.1-en, 4.2-en, 4.21-en, 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/js/edit.js`
  - Possible versions: 4.1-en, 4.2-en, 4.21-en, 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/js/tc/mixer/display.js`
  - Possible versions: 4.2-en, 4.21-en, 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.
- **Hit**: `http://laws.qualys.com/mt-static/js/archetype_editor.js`
  - Possible versions: 4.22-en, 4.23-en, 4.24-en, etc.

**Final Result:**
- **Fingerprinting Resulted In**: 4.22-en, 4.22-en-COM, 4.23-en, 4.23-en-COM
- **Best Guess**: 4.23-en-COM

### 5. Fingerprinting Results
Let's test the tool with WordPress on the website `http://www.andrewhay.ca/`.

```bash
$ ./BlindElephant.py http://www.andrewhay.ca/ wordpress
```

**Output:**
- **Loaded**: 159 versions, 599 differentiating paths, and 226 version groups.
- **Starting Fingerprint**: for WordPress at `http://www.andrewhay.ca/`.

**Fingerprinting Result:**
- **Possible Versions**: 3.0-RC1, 3.0-RC1-IIS
- **Best Guess**: 3.0-RC1

### 6. Application Distribution Analysis
We conducted app identification and fingerprinting on 1,084,152 hosts, with 34,000 targeted scans for bug shakeout and calibration. Shodan was used for data collection, and the sample was slightly biased towards default installations.

**Version Distributions:**
- **Drupal** (June 18, 2010)
  - Affected by a critical vulnerability: 70%
  - [Graph showing version distribution]
