Abstract
Brainwaves have proved to be unique enough across individu-
als to be useful as biometrics. They also provide promising
advantages over traditional means of authentication, such as
resistance to external observability, revocability, and intrinsic
liveness detection. However, most of the research so far has
been conducted with expensive, bulky, medical-grade helmets,
which offer limited applicability for everyday usage. With the
aim to bring brainwave authentication and its beneﬁts closer
to real world deployment, we investigate brain biometrics
with consumer devices. We conduct a comprehensive experi-
ment that compares ﬁve authentication tasks on a user sample
up to 10 times larger than those from previous studies, intro-
ducing three novel techniques based on cognitive semantic
processing. We analyze both the performance and usability
of the different options and use this evidence to elicit design
and research recommendations. Our results show that it is
possible to achieve Equal Error Rates of 14.5% (a reduction
between 37%-44% with respect to existing approaches) based
on brain responses to images with current inexpensive tech-
nology. With regard to adoption, users call for simpler devices,
faster authentication, and better privacy.
1 Introduction
The ﬁeld of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) has researched
and come to solutions that allow humans to communicate
with machines using their brains [80]. These technologies
have been especially important in the health sector, where
BCIs can for example expand the interaction capabilities of
people with severe paralysis [10]. But with the development of
consumer-grade electroencephalogram (EEG) readers [25, 30,
33, 41, 54], new opportunities appear for using BCIs in many
other realms, such as entertainment or marketing [74, 81].
Indeed, low cost headsets are already being commercialized
for these purposes and we can ﬁnd app stores1 that offer brain
controlled games, relaxation trainers, and several other types
1https://store.neurosky.com/collections/apps
of applications. In this context, and further spurred by the
drawbacks of using passwords for proving online identity,
research on brain biometrics has recently attracted a great
deal of attention.
Brainwaves – patterns of measurable electrical impulses
emitted as a result of the interaction of billions of neurons
inside the human brain– present particular features that make
them stand out over more traditional biometrics [28,72]. Con-
trary to traits like e.g., face or gait, which can be observed
from the outside and potentially misused to identify users
without consent [35, 78], brain activity is not observable and
thus resistant to this type of surveillance. Another noteworthy
aspect is that credentials based on brainwaves can be easily
revoked: our brain responses vary with the stimuli, and so in
the case of having brainwaves stolen, a new credential could
be generated by changing its associated stimulus. Besides,
given that brain activity is always present in living human be-
ings, brainwaves can strengthen authentication with intrinsic
liveness detection.
But despite the beneﬁts of brain biometrics and the emerg-
ing democratization of EEG technology, more research is
needed to make brainwave authentication applicable in real-
world scenarios. Currently, the vast majority of existing work
is focused on medical-grade equipment, and the scarce ex-
periments with consumer devices involve small user samples,
implement basic authentication techniques (e.g., resting), and
provide limited insights on usability. Furthermore, solutions
are oriented to optimize particular classiﬁcation models but
provide little exploration of different implementation options
and their practical implications. The result is a conspicuous
lack of information on how to design brainwave authentica-
tion systems for different scenarios. Motivated to ﬁll this gap,
we make two fundamental contributions to move forward:
• (1) Design, implementation, and testing of new au-
thentication techniques. We focus on techniques based
on the extraction of time-locked endogenous brain re-
sponses, which are known to provide higher signal-to-
noise ratio than continuous EEG recordings, the common
practice in related work. Apart from techniques known

in the medical-grade literature, we introduce three new
tasks based on cognitive semantic processing. As a main
result, we are able to achieve Equal Error Rates of 14.5%,
which suppose a reduction of 37%-44% with respect to
previous studies. Furthermore, we are the ﬁrst to report
a comprehensive comparison of brainwave authentica-
tion tasks, including testing with one-class vs two class
classiﬁers, analyzing the relevance of features in time
and frequency, considering usability, and grounded on
a subject pool (N=52) that is up to 10 times larger than
the sample size in previous studies.
• (2) Usability study. Generally, achieving high classiﬁ-
cation accuracy at the cost of low usability in authenti-
cation system design is problematic, since it can limit
real-world applicability. Despite its importance, only
two works so far have considered usability in the ﬁeld
of consumer-grade brainwave authentication. Chuang et
al. [20] conducted an experimental user study asking par-
ticipants (N=15) to rate authentication tasks according to
how enjoyable, easy, or engaging they were. Besides this
pioneer study, Sohankar et al. [66] analyzed the usabil-
ity of brainwave authentication systems in the literature
against an heuristic metric built on parameters such as
the type of headset or the estimated time to authenticate,
but without considering users’ experiences and percep-
tions. Here, we explore the usability of the proposed
authentication techniques through empirical evidence as
in [20], but extending the scope of the evaluation to: 1)
cover both the usability of the tasks and the brainwave
device, and 2) explore attitudes towards acceptance. Our
results extend and complement previous work and aid in
understanding the usability-security tradeoffs to take into
account when implementing an authentication system.
Apart from these two studies, we contribute to the literature
by distilling lessons learned to inform future designs and
research on brainwave authentication, publishing our dataset
to facilitate replication and encourage further research.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 introduces the status quo on brainwave authentication,
deﬁnes important concepts, and sets up our application sce-
nario. Sections 3 and 4, focus on the design of authentication
tasks to collect brainwaves and detail data processing steps.
We report performance and usability results in Sections 5
and 6. Finally, the paper wraps up with a discussion of lessons
learned in Section 7 and conclusions in Section 8.
2 Background
To set the background knowledge for the rest of the paper, we
describe here the state of the art in brainwave authentication
systems, followed by a primer on their key components, and
the threat model and use-case we adopt.
2.1 Related Work
Since the ﬁrst human electroencephalogram was recorded
in 1924 [29], many studies have shown that brain activity
contains individuating patterns due to the inﬂuence of both
genetic factors, e.g., given the unique folding structures of the
cortex, and non-genetic factors, such as intelligence or previ-
ous experiences [11, 45, 79]. On these grounds, researchers
have investigated the usage of brainwaves as biometrics for
user identiﬁcation and authentication. However, the vast ma-
jority of this research [28] has been conducted using medical-
grade EEG equipment, which is highly precise, but at the same
time expensive, bulky, and difﬁcult to use. In this line of work,
Palaniappan and Mandic [55], in 2007, recorded the EEGs of
102 subjects and applied classiﬁcation algorithms demonstrat-
ing an overall authentication accuracy of 98%. This study and
similar works have shown promising results and opened the
door to further research with the advent of consumer-grade
EEG devices in 2007. At this point, with low-cost, easy, and
even aesthetic wearables, brainwave-based authentication for
the masses has become a tangible possibility. And so the ques-
tion arises whether it is possible to get accurate results with
this type of EEG headsets.
The literature on consumer-grade EEG authentication is
scarce and so far it only includes experiments with a small
number of subjects2 as opposed to the medical case. This is
an important gap, since the reported accuracy may not hold
when applied to larger populations where the probability of
ﬁnding similar users increases [32]. Additionally, existing
works mostly implement authentication based on continuous
EEG recordings (e.g., while relaxing or imagining something),
but few of them [2, 51, 52, 71] have looked speciﬁcally at
the extraction of time-locked brain variations that appear in
reaction to external stimuli. These variations, called ERPs
(Event Related Potentials), have been successfully tried in
research with medical EEG equipment, and they are appealing
for the consumer scenario given their higher signal-to-noise
ratio. Another important limitation in current research is that
most publications test one authentication task but there are few
comparisons between different alternatives and just Chuang
et al. [20] have addressed the usability of EEG authentication
as perceived by users, a key aspect to understand adoption.
Looking at the existing gaps, in this work we aim to move
beyond the state of the art by expanding three main fronts.
First, we implement new authentication tasks based on ERPs
for consumer brainwave readers. Second, we thoroughly com-
pare these tasks, evaluating not only their performance but
also conducting a user study to understand usability. And
third, we do our experiments on a larger set of users (N=52)
and release the dataset to allow for replication and further
research.
2Generally ≤ 10; the maximum reported number of users is 31 [2]

In this scenario, we consider a “zero effort” adversary [43].
This type of attacker tries to impersonate a valid user by claim-
ing the target’s identity (IDu) and presenting the attacker’s
own biometric characteristic to the system. We assume this
attacker has physical access to the device of the target victim.
The resistance of a biometric system to zero-effort attacks is
the system false accept rate (FAR), which we calculate, among
other metrics, to discuss the performance of the proposed au-
thentication mechanisms. We use this scenario and attacker
model to guide our experiments and we further discuss the
applicability to different use-cases in Section 7.
3 Brainwave Data Acquisition
In the ﬁrst step of a brainwave authentication system, spe-
ciﬁc brain signals of a user need to be activated in order to
generate her credential or authentication material. This pro-
cess is called acquisition protocol and can be accomplished
trough different types of tasks [28]. Resting tasks, where the
user is asked to relax in a comfortable position without mov-
ing or thinking of anything in particular, are the easiest to
perform. Indeed, they were among the ﬁrst protocols to be
investigated [60] due to their simplicity. A second category of
protocols is that of mental tasks. In this case, users are asked
to carry out imaginary actions, motor-related or not. When
performing motor imaginary actions, users have to imagine
kinesthetic movements of selected body parts, as opening
and closing a ﬁst or moving a ﬁnger [20]. Non-motor imagi-
nary, on the contrary, refers to all other mental tasks that are
not related to movement [83], such as mental letter composi-
tion [56], imagined speech [15], or mental calculation [48].
The last category of protocols, stimulus-related tasks, con-
sists of approaches that expose subjects to stimuli of different
nature (e.g., visual, auditory, emotional).
The most common approach for brainwave authentication
is to use the continuous EEG signal associated to the whole du-
ration of a task. But stimulus-based tasks offer an alternative
possibility because they can also evoke speciﬁc time-locked
potentials. These brain responses, called Event-related Po-
tentials (ERPs) [79], appear as a temporary variation of the
brainwave’s voltage amplitude [36]. While more complex
to implement, acquisition protocols based on ERPs provide
a higher signal-to-noise ratio, being less sensitive to back-
ground perturbations [5]. This feature makes ERPs specially
suitable for systems based on consumer-grade EEG devices,
in which cheap sensors capture signals with lower quality
compared to medical-grade electrodes [7, 24, 28]. Given the
potential for ERPs to provide better accuracy, we design our
tasks based on them and deﬁne the brainwave collection ex-
periment accordingly.

2.2 Brainwave Authentication Basics
In a biometric authentication system, users are granted ac-
cess depending on their distinct physiological or behavioral
traits, such as the commonly used ﬁngerprints, voice, or face
features. These traits are collected through speciﬁc sensors,
processed, and compared to a previously stored sample or
template from the user trying to authenticate, checking if it
is a match or a mismatch. Though brainwave patterns can
be used to prove a person’s identity, their acquisition differs
with respect to other biometrics: they need to be “generated”
while performing a speciﬁc task or as a response to a stimulus,
such as sounds or images. Conversely, the primary modules
of a brainwave-based authentication system [28], depicted in
Figure 1, are:
Generation and measurement ( 3). Executes the acquisi-
tion protocol or task that triggers unique brainwave ac-
tivity and records the associated voltage ﬂuctuations.
Signal Pre-processing ( 4.1). Treats the raw EEG signal to
remove undesirable artifacts, such as interferences from
nearby electronics, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
Feature Extraction ( 4.1). Isolates the signal components
that are relevant for authentication, i.e., those that contain
the most information about a subject.
Classiﬁcation. ( 4.2) Implements algorithms to tell authentic
and non-authentic users apart.
2.3 Use Case and Threat Model
We consider a brainwave-based authentication system that
protects access to applications in a desktop or laptop com-
puter. First, the users must complete an enrollment phase,
where their brain signals are collected to build a classiﬁcation
model and stored with their identity (e.g., a username). Then,
during the authentication phase, a user supplies her identity
and receives a series of visual stimuli. The generated brain
responses are compared to the stored user model for denying
or granting access. Therefore, for each user with true identity
IDt and claimed identity IDc, we test the hypotheses:
H0 : IDt = IDc
vs. H1 : IDt (cid:54)= IDc
(1)
to decide if the user is genuine or not (accept/reject H0).

3.1 Experiment Design
We focus on endogenous ERPs, a type of potentials that occur
after the cognitive processing of sensory stimuli, i.e., later
than 100ms after stimulus presentation3. While exogenous
ERPs appear earlier and just depend on physical parameters
of the stimulus (e.g., light intensity), endogenous ERPs are
partially inﬂuenced by the subject’s knowledge, motivation
level, and cognitive abilities [11], and so more likely to ex-
hibit individual characteristics useful for authentication [79].
These characteristics, together with the stable morphology of
ERPs [5, 12], are the foundations for the uniqueness of this
type of brainwaves. The most relevant endogenous ERPs are
the P300 and the N400:
P300. It is a positive wave that peaks around 300ms after
exposure to a certain stimulus [36]. This wave is trig-
gered if a subject decides consciously or unconsciously
that a presented stimulus or event is rare. In experimen-
tal setups, a P300 response can be elicited using the
Oddball Paradigm [67], in which low-probability target
items (e.g., pictures) are mixed with high-probability
non-target or “standard” items.
N400. It is a negative wave that peaks at 400ms after a stim-
ulus [38]. While the P300 is related to the attention of
a subject, the N400 appears related to tasks that require
semantic processing [36], such as language processing.
We devised ﬁve acquisition protocols to elicit the described
potentials for authentication. The ﬁrst two protocols focus on
the P300 ERP, and were selected based on their successful
application with medical-grade equipment. Besides, to fur-
ther explore the space of possibilities, we introduce three new
tasks built on the N400 potential that have never been used
for authentication. The following list describes how we imple-
mented the acquisition protocols grounded on neuroscience
research techniques to trigger ERP potentials [23, 36–38, 67] :
P300:Selected. This task elicits the P300 potential based on
the oddball paradigm. We ﬁrst let the user pick a picture
of her choice, which will be the target stimulus. The
authentication task consists of looking at a sequence
of images where the target image appears infrequently.
Upon appearance, because it is a rare occurrence, a P300
is evoked that differs across subjects. To increase the
attention and therefore the wave amplitude, we instructed
the users to count the occurrences of the target stimuli.
P300:Assigned. Same as P300:Selected, but the is assigned
the rare image.
N400:Words. This task is based on a semantic priming
paradigm. Priming is deﬁned as “an improvement in
performance in a perceptual or cognitive task, relative
to an appropriate baseline, which is caused by previous,
related experience” [73]. Simply put, a subject is primed
on an object if it has previous experience with this object.
3A comprehensive overview of currently known ERPs identiﬁed in neu-
rological research can be found in [69].
After priming, if the subject is presented with a semanti-
cally related stimulus, the brain ﬁnds it more meaningful
and so the N400 potential appears. In our experiment,
subjects watch a ‘priming video’ that displays cars driv-
ing on a highway. Afterward, several words are shown
on the screen. A minority of these words is strongly re-
lated to the priming objects and aims at triggering N400
responses, and the rest are randomly generated.
N400:Sentences. This task is based on the concept of incon-
gruent sentences. The N400 has been proved to appear
when subjects read sentences word by word that end
in a semantically incongruent manner [37]. An exam-
ple for such a sentence is: “Steve sat down to eat his
car”. Furthermore, the amplitude of the N400 wave de-
pends on the subject’s expectancy for the ﬁnal word.
This means that if subjects are primed on certain con-
gruent endings, the N400 response is stronger when the
incongruent word appears [38]. We therefore base on this
observation to build our experiment. The task consists
of showing users a sequence of sentences with slight
variations. First, the sentences have semantically con-
gruent endings, but the last variation ﬁnishes with an
incongruent word to elicit a strong N400.
N400:Faces. This task is based on the concept of inhibition
of knowledge associated to N400 potentials evoked dur-
ing face identiﬁcation, which is another type of cogni-
tive semantic processing, different from words. Previous
work has determined that the amplitude of this wave is
stronger when looking at an unfamiliar face after being
presented (and therefore primed) with a sequence of fa-
miliar faces [23]. The reason is that when seeing familiar
faces, the brain activates semantic representations useful
to cognitively process and identify them, but these repre-
sentations need to be removed and new ones activated
when we start to process a new and unfamiliar individ-
ual. This inhibition of knowledge intensiﬁes the N400.
On these grounds, our protocol shows unfamiliar faces
within sequences of likely familiar faces (celebrities).
3.2 Experiment Execution
Goal and Structure. The experiment at the core of this re-
search has two goals: 1) eliciting and recording ERPs with
individuating features to be used for authentication; and 2)
collect information on the perceived usability of brainwave
authentication. Figure 2 illustrates the brainwave collection
part of the experiment, based on the ﬁve acquisition tasks de-
scribed in Section 3.1. After providing consent to take part in
the study, participants were told to sit comfortably and move
as little as possible during the experiment. Every room was
