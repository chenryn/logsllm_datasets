User: It's a common question not specifically about some language or platform. Who is responsible for a file created in systems $TEMP folder?
If it's my duty, why should I care where to put this file? I can place it anywhere with same result.
If it's OS responsibility, can I forgot about this file right after use?
Thanks and sorry for my basic English.
Assistant: As a general rule, you should remove the temporary files that you create.  
Recall that the $TEMP directory is a shared resource that other programs can use.  Failure to remove the temporary files will have an impact on the other programs that use $TEMP.
What kind of impacts?  That will depend upon the other programs.  If those other programs create a lot of temporary files, then their execution will be slower as it will take longer to create a new temporary file as the directory will have to be scanned on each temporary file creation to ensure that the file name is unique.
Consider the following (based on real events) ...
In years past, my group at work had to use the Intel C Compiler.  We found that over time, it appeared to be slowing down.  That is, the time it took to run our sanity tests using it took longer and longer.  This also applied to building/compiling a single C file.  We tracked the problem down.
ICC was opening, stat'ing and reading every file under $TEMP.  For what purpose, I know not.  Although the argument can be made that the problem lay with the ICC, the existence of the files under $TEMP was slowing it and our development team down.  Deleting those temporary files resulted in the sanity checks running in less than a half hour instead of over two--a significant time saver.
Hope this helps.
