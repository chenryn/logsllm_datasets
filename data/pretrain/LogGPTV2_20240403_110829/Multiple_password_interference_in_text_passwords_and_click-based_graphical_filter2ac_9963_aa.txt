ABSTRACT
The underlying issues relating to the usability and security of mul-
tiple passwords are largely unexplored. However, we know that
people generally have difﬁculty remembering multiple passwords.
This reduces security since users reuse the same password for dif-
ferent systems or reveal other passwords as they try to log in. We
report on a laboratory study comparing recall of multiple text pass-
words with recall of multiple click-based graphical passwords. In
a one-hour session (short-term), we found that participants in the
graphical password condition coped signiﬁcantly better than those
in the text password condition. In particular, they made fewer errors
when recalling their passwords, did not resort to creating passwords
directly related to account names, and did not use similar passwords
across multiple accounts. After two weeks, participants in the two
conditions had recall success rates that were not statistically differ-
ent from each other, but those with text passwords made more re-
call errors than participants with graphical passwords. In our study,
click-based graphical passwords were signiﬁcantly less susceptible
to multiple password interference in the short-term, while having
comparable usability to text passwords in most other respects.

(HCI) principles should sufﬁce, but security constraints make this
problematic. Most importantly, some design features that might
make a system more usable would also make it less secure. Ad-
dressing these security weaknesses can too easily render the soft-
ware unusable again. Even worse, one might argue that an unusable
security system is inherently insecure, since users will then misuse
or bypass the security mechanisms. One must also consider how
the design affects the observable behaviour of legitimate users, in
case such behaviour could be exploited by attackers. The challenge
is to design software that is both secure and usable [10].
In this paper, we address an important issue in user authentica-
tion software: the memorability of multiple passwords. Authenti-
cation software supports legitimate users in gaining access to sys-
tems or resources by verifying their credentials. We focus on pass-
words, the most common form of credentials. The problem with
passwords is making them easy for legitimate users to remember,
but difﬁcult for attackers to guess. Alternatives to passwords in-
clude physical tokens or biometrics; these also have problems, such
as cost, management, and privacy, which we will not address in the
paper. As passwords are the most common method of authenti-
cation, the password problem is important, and is made worse by
the increasing number of users and the number of different systems
they access [15,18]. In particular, users now need to remember not
just one password, but many. This places a signiﬁcant memory load
on users, leading them to choose (and reuse) simple passwords that
are easy for attackers to guess. Despite this reality, there has been
little work investigating the issues relating to multiple passwords.
Our current work is motivated by recent proposals for alterna-
tive kinds of passwords, particularly click-based graphical pass-
words [3, 39]. In such systems, the user does not enter a text pass-
word using a keyboard, but instead clicks on particular points on an
image. Such graphical passwords are intended to take advantage
of the human ability to more easily recognize and recall images
than textual information [29]. We wished to study whether this ap-
proach had advantages over text passwords when multiple distinct
passwords were necessary. We were concerned about the potential
for multiple password interference, where remembering a password
for one system might affect the user’s memory of a password for
another system. As described in the cognitive psychology litera-
ture [2], memory interference is “the impaired ability to remember
an item when it is similar to other items stored in memory”.
Our study was conducted in a laboratory setting where 65 partic-
ipants were assigned to use either textual or graphical passwords.
They created six distinct passwords for several different “accounts”,
and later had to recall the passwords for each account in a different
order than they were created. Twenty-six of those participants also
returned after two weeks to test recall of these passwords. In the
500case of graphical passwords, each account was associated with a
different image, so participants had one image per password. Liter-
ature on memory research acknowledges that ceiling effects, such
as high success rates that mask differences between conditions, are
a problem which must be overcome with careful experimental de-
sign in order to get meaningful results [22]. While our study does
not mirror real-life usage of passwords, the intent of the experiment
was to highlight differences in performance.
We found that in the short-term, participants had more difﬁculty
recalling multiple text passwords than multiple graphical passwords.
However, after two weeks, both groups had signiﬁcant difﬁculty
remembering their passwords and there was no statistical differ-
ence in success rates. We further found that participants in the text
condition could more easily recall their passwords when they used
insecure password practices, such as choosing passwords that fol-
lowed a common pattern or that were obviously associated with ac-
count names. For example, 40% of text passwords were obviously
related to their associated account. These results constitute evi-
dence for an important advantage inherent in click-based graphical
passwords – built-in cueing that helps with memorability – while
text password systems encourage users to adopt insecure coping
strategies. In post-hoc analysis, we found that males were more
successful than females with graphical passwords and that males
were more likely to use account-related text passwords. These re-
sults align with psychology literature showing that males perform
better at visual-spatial tasks and more weakly in linguistic tasks
than females [5,23]. The results of this paper motivate further study
in ﬁeld settings and deeper examination of the underlying human
factors issues involved in using these authentication mechanisms.
The remainder of the paper is divided as follows. Section 2 pro-
vides background on the type of graphical password system used,
memory cueing, and multiple password interference. In Sections 3
and 4, we outline our hypotheses, describe the methodology of our
study, and present the results. We discuss validation of our hy-
potheses in Section 5. Lastly, we offer some discussion and con-
cluding remarks in Sections 6 and 7.
2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
Security is rarely a user’s primary task [37], and typically in-
volves an extra step in addition to the main task, such as having to
log in to read one’s email. Users need security features to be as
non-disruptive as possible, but still need them to work properly to
preserve integrity and privacy. A second unusual characteristic of
security software is that it attracts illegitimate users of the system
who are actively trying to gain unauthorized access. These attack-
ers will take advantage of all information available. Usable security
software must therefore offer assistance to legitimate users, with-
out giving assistance to attackers. In particular, this changes the
nature of feedback in interaction design, which must inform legiti-
mate users while revealing no useful information to others.
With any authentication system where users are expected to re-
call information to log in, there is a risk of memory interference.
Multiple password interference occurs when users must remem-
ber passwords for many systems and the memories of the differ-
ent passwords interfere with each other. Studies have shown that
users typically create easy-to-guess text passwords and reuse these
passwords across several accounts [1, 15, 18]. When trying to log
in, they will cycle through their passwords until they ﬁnd one that
works. Gaw and Felten [18] report that users in their lab study tried
an average of 2.43 passwords before a correct login. This may be
under-reporting the problem, however, because users in their study
were only allowed 90 seconds per account. While this trial-and-
error approach helps users deal with password systems and multi-
ple password interference, revealing all of one’s passwords at every
login can amplify security risks, for example in the presence of key
loggers or when passwords are sent to phishing sites.
One proposed solution to the password problem is to use a pass-
word manager. With a password manager, users typically have one
master password and the password manager creates, stores, and en-
ters passwords for individual accounts on behalf of the user. The
individual passwords are typically much more random than what
users would select on their own and are thus stronger against at-
tack. However, implementations of some password managers have
usability problems [9] that can leave users even more vulnerable
than when they were managing passwords themselves. A second
drawback is that a centralized scheme has a new single point of fail-
ure: if attackers gain access to the master password, they now have
control over all of the user’s accounts. While password managers
may be appropriate in some circumstances, authentication schemes
that are both secure and memorable are still needed.
We are interested in the graphical password approach.
It has
been suggested that graphical passwords may be less susceptible to
multiple password interference since humans have better memory
for recognizing and recalling images than text [24, 31]. Surveys of
graphical passwords circa 2005 are available from Suo et al. [32]
and from Monrose and Reiter [26]. Proposed schemes include
click-based graphical passwords such as PassPoints [39]. Many
of these have the added advantage of presenting a cue to the user to
help trigger the appropriate memory. Cued-recall has been estab-
lished as an easier memory task than uncued recall [29, 34]. With
cued-recall, the system provides a cue to help prompt the user’s
memory of the password (or a portion thereof). This is a desirable
usability feature that reduces the memory load on users. With click-
based graphical passwords, a password consists of user-selected
click-points on the images presented. Therefore, the images act
as mnemonic cues to remember the corresponding click-points.
In PassPoints, users are presented with an image, and a pass-
word consists of 5 click-points on the image (see Figure 1). To
log in, users must select the same 5 click-points in the same or-
der. The system allows for a tolerance area around each click-point
so that approximately correct login attempts are accepted. Several
user studies and security analyses have been conducted on Pass-
Points [6, 13, 20, 33, 38–40]. While these have found PassPoints
to be generally usable, security concerns have been raised because
users tend to select predictable passwords which are exploitable in
dictionary attacks [13, 30, 33]. Newer click-based graphical pass-
word schemes, such as Persuasive Cued Click-Points [7,8], address
two important security concerns with respect to user selected pass-
words [11]: they offer a signiﬁcant reduction in hotspots (i.e., areas
of the image that have higher probability of being selected by users)
and in the use of click-point patterns (such as selecting click-points
that form a straight line across the image). These characteristics
signiﬁcantly reduce vulnerability to dictionary attacks. The present
paper uses the better-known PassPoints scheme for these interfer-
ence tests, in order to leverage a more closely-examined and un-
derstood password scheme and to build on existing results [6] on
interference between two passwords only (see below).
A few studies have compared text passwords to graphical pass-
words, but in these cases, users only had one password to remem-
ber (either text or graphical). Wiedenbeck et al. [39] compared user
performance of text passwords and PassPoints in a lab study. Their
results were mixed, but slightly favoured text passwords. Koman-
duri and Hutchings’s study [21] compared text passwords to their
newly proposed picture-password scheme. They found better mem-
orability for their picture-passwords although the results were not
statistically signiﬁcant due to a small user sample.

compared multiple password interference for these two conditions:
the Text condition (MText) and the PassPoints condition (MPP).
Our speciﬁc hypotheses with respect to multiple password inter-
ference were:
Figure 1: A PassPoints password consists of 5 ordered click-
points (the numbered labels do not appear in practice).
To our knowledge, there is little published work examining the
problem of multiple password interference, despite the growing
number of passwords held by most users. Moncur and Lepatre [25]
compared VIP, a recognition-based graphical password scheme in
which users select their images from a set of decoys, to a graph-
ical variation of 4-digit PINs (Personal Identiﬁcation Numbers).
While they showed that users were slightly more likely to recall
5 VIP passwords than PINs, it is unclear how this compares to
text passwords. Passwords in their study were not associated with
any “accounts”, and the study did not take into consideration se-
rial memory effects. Recently, Everitt et al. [14] investigated how
interference and frequency of access affected memorability of 4
recognition-based PassFaces [11] passwords. They found that in-
frequently accessed passwords were more difﬁcult to remember
and that users performed better when they had a chance to prac-
tice each new password individually over several days rather than
learning several at once. Both of these studies focus solely on
usability and do not consider the security of the schemes them-
selves or whether changes in user behaviour when dealing with
multiple passwords may affect the security of the system (although
passwords were assigned in the PassFaces study to eliminate user
choice).
Multiple password interference was also examined as part of a
ﬁeld study of PassPoints [6]. In this study, a subset of participants
had two distinct passwords to remember (on two different images).
These participants had lower login success rates than those with
only one password. We are not aware of comparable studies for
regular text passwords, so it is unknown how this performance de-
crease compares with text passwords. Vu et al. [36] conducted lab
studies examining the effect of various text password restrictions on
memorability when multiple passwords were used. Their results in-
clude that users with ﬁve passwords had more difﬁculty than those
who had only three, that some users selected passwords with ob-
vious connection to their accounts, and that password restrictions
were not sufﬁcient for encouraging secure text password selection.
3. STUDY DETAILS
We hypothesized that click-based graphical passwords would be
easier for users to recall than text passwords when users had mul-
tiple passwords to remember. In other words, there would be less
interference from multiple unique graphical passwords than multi-
ple unique text passwords. Although many variants of graphical
passwords and text passwords were available, we began our in-
vestigation with regular text passwords, where users were free to
select any password, and PassPoints, the click-based graphical sys-
1. Participants will have lower recall success rates with text
passwords than with PassPoints passwords.
2. Participants in the Text condition are more likely than Pass-
Points participants to use patterns across their own passwords.
3. Participants will recall text passwords more slowly than Pass-
Points passwords.
4. Participants in the Text condition are more likely than Pass-
Points participants to create passwords that are directly re-
lated to their corresponding accounts.
5. Participants in the Text condition will make more recall er-
rors than participants in the PassPoints condition.
We conducted a lab study with 65 participants (26 males and 39
females). Participants completed their sessions individually. This
study used a between-subjects design and had two conditions; half
of the participants were randomly assigned to the Text password
condition and half to the PassPoints password condition. All par-
ticipants were familiar with text passwords, but no participant in
the PassPoints condition had any previous experience with graphi-
cal passwords. Participants were primarily university students from
various degree programs. All were regular internet users, but none
were experts in computer security.
Programs for the Text and PassPoints conditions were imple-
mented as stand-alone Windows applications and displayed on a
17-inch screen. The PassPoints application used 451x331 pixel im-
ages, tolerance areas of 19x19 pixels, and 5 click-points. This con-
ﬁguration is consistent with previous studies [6, 39]. The images
are identiﬁed as: Cars, Mural, Philadelphia, Pool, Statue, and Truck
(Figures 2 to 7). These were images from a previous PassPoints lab
study [6] and shown to have average to good usability and security.
A PassPoints system using this conﬁguration has a theoretical pass-
word space of 244 possible passwords. The Text password system
enforced an 8-character minimum, but no other restrictions were
imposed; this gives a theoretical password space of 252. While 32
special characters are available on a standard keyboard, most users
use a very small subset of these special characters. In fact, there
is evidence that they do not even realize that these can be included
in a password or know how to type them [16]. While these spe-
cial characters are included in the theoretical password space, it is
highly improbable that passwords contain any of them. The the-
oretical password space of PassPoints could be enlarged to match
that of text passwords through different system conﬁguration, but
we chose to maintain compatibility with previous studies. Reduc-
ing the text password limit to less than 8 characters also seemed to
be a poor alternative.
3.1 Methodology
Our study included two lab-based sessions. Session 1 took one
hour and was completed by all 65 participants. For Session 2, par-
ticipant returned to the lab and tried to recall their previously cre-
ated passwords. The second session occurred after two weeks and
was completed by 26 participants.1
1Session 2 was added to our methodology after we examined the
initial results. 26 out of 28 participants recruited after this method-
ology change completed Session 2.
