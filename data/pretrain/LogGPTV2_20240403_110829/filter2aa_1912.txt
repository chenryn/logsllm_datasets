## About the Talk
### Background
- **WEP Vulnerability (2001):** The original 802.11 standard included only one security configuration, WEP, which was cracked in 2001. Since then, numerous attacks on WEP have been published and demonstrated.
- **WPA2 Adoption:** Most modern WLANs now use WPA2, a more robust and secure protocol. WPA2 is also used to secure Guest WiFi, Municipal WiFi (e.g., GoogleWiFi Secure), and Public WiFi (e.g., T-Mobile or AT&T WiFi Hotspot) networks.

### Is WPA2 Safe for WiFi Networks?
- **Vulnerabilities of WPA/WPA2:**
  - **2003:** PSK Vulnerability
  - **2004:** PSK Cracking Tool, Eavesdropping
  - **2008:** TKIP Vulnerability, PEAP Mis-configuration Vulnerability
- **Types of Attacks:**
  - **Attack on Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication:**
    - Implications: Eavesdropping, Unauthorized Access
  - **Attack on 802.1x Authentication:**
    - Implications: Client Compromise
  - **Attack on Encryption:**
    - Implications: Injection of small frames to create disruption

### Solutions
1. **Avoid PSK Authentication in Non-Private/Non-Home Networks:** This mitigates PSK vulnerabilities.
2. **Do Not Ignore Certificate Validation Checks in Client Configurations:** This addresses client vulnerabilities.
3. **Use AES Encryption:** This solves TKIP vulnerabilities.

## Encryption in WPA2
### Encryption Keys
- **Pairwise Key (PTK):** Used to protect unicast data frames.
- **Group Key (GTK):** Shared among all associated clients and used to protect group-addressed data frames (e.g., broadcast ARP request frames).

### GTK Usage
- **GTK Sharing:**
  - **Client 1:** PTK = PTK1, Group key = K1
  - **Client 2:** PTK = PTK2, Group key = K1
  - **Client 3:** PTK = PTK3, Group key = K1
- **Group Addressed Traffic:**
  - **ToDS (Broadcast ARP Request Frame):** Destination MAC = AP/BSSID MAC
  - **From DS (Broadcast ARP Request Frame):** Destination MAC = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- **Client Use of GTK for Group-Addressed Frame Encryption:**
  - **Question:** Can a client send forged group-addressed data frames?
  - **Answer:** Yes, a malicious user can inject fake packets using known GTK, KeyID, and PN parameters.

### Insider Attack Vulnerability
- **Implications:**
  - **Stealth Mode ARP Poisoning/Spoofing Attack:**
    - Attacker injects fake ARP packets to poison the client's cache for the gateway.
    - Victim sends all traffic to the attacker.
    - Attacker can drop traffic or forward it to the actual gateway.
  - **Traffic Snooping:**
  - **Man in the Middle (MiM) Attack:**
  - **IP Layer DoS Attack:**
  - **Wireless DoS Attack:**
    - Blocks downlink broadcast data frame reception.

### Demonstration
- **Live Demo:** A live demonstration of the exploit will be conducted during the presentation.

## Prevention and Countermeasures
### Endpoint Security
- **Detection Tools:**
  - **DecaffeinatID:** Detects ARP cache poisoning.
  - **Snort:** Network intrusion detection system.

### Limitations
- **Smartphones and Other Devices:** Many devices connect to WPA2-secured WiFi networks, but detection software is primarily available for Windows and Linux.
- **Operating Systems and Hardware:** Not all standalone mode APs or WLAN controllers support PSPF or client isolation.

### Infrastructure Side
- **Public Secure Packet Forwarding (PSPF)/Peer-to-Peer (P2P) or Client Isolation:**
  - **Functionality:** Stops communication between two WiFi-enabled client devices.
  - **Limitations:**
    - Not all standalone mode APs or WLAN controllers have built-in PSPF or client isolation capabilities.
    - PSPF or client isolation does not always work across multiple APs or controllers.
    - An attacker can use a WiFi client to launch an attack and set up a non-WiFi host to serve the victim, bypassing PSPF/client isolation.

### Long-Term Solution: Protocol Enhancement
- **Deprecate GTK and Group-Addressed Data Traffic from AP:**
  - Convert all group-addressed data traffic into unicast traffic.
  - For backward compatibility, AP should send randomly generated different GTKs to different clients.
  - **Disadvantages:**
    - Reduces total network throughput.
    - Requires AP software upgrades.

## Key Takeaways
- **WPA2 is secure but vulnerable to insider attacks.**
- **This limitation is known to WPA2 designers but not well understood by WiFi users.**
- **Countermeasures can be deployed where the threat of insider attacks is high.**
- **Using endpoint security or wireless traffic monitoring with WIPS sensors.**
