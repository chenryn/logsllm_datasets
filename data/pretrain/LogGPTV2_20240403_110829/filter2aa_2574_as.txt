### The Utility of Reviews in Buying Decisions

Consumers often find reviews invaluable for making informed purchasing decisions. Two of the most popular review platforms are Yelp (https://www.yelp.com) and Angieâ€™s List (https://www.angieslistbusinesscenter.com).

### Popular Social Networking Sites

Not all social media platforms enjoy the same level of global popularity. Figure 5-3, based on data from Statista.com as of September 2017, ranks the most popular social media sites by the number of active users (in millions). Given the rapidly evolving nature of social media, these statistics can change frequently. However, the leading platforms are expected to maintain their dominance in the near future.

### Investigating Social Media Sites

In this section, we will explore the most popular social media sites and demonstrate how to conduct more effective searches to uncover useful and hidden information that is not accessible through standard search functions. Our focus will be on social networking sites, as searching within multimedia content was covered in the previous chapter. These sites are rich sources of personal information and social interactions, which can be valuable for online investigations.

### Facebook

Facebook (https://www.facebook.com) is the world's largest social networking site, with over 2 billion active users globally. Founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, it was initially designed for Harvard University students but later expanded to include other U.S. universities. In 2006, Facebook opened its membership to anyone over 13 years old with a valid email address.

#### Creating a Facebook Account

To create a Facebook account, you need to provide an email address or phone number, a password, your date of birth, and gender. After activating your account, you can add additional details such as work and education history, contact information, religious and political views, languages, other social accounts, personal blogs, family and relationship information, and more.

#### Social Interactions on Facebook

Facebook allows users to:
- Share updates, photos, videos, and geolocation data.
- View, comment, like, and share friends' posts.
- Invite friends to groups and events.
- Chat using Facebook Messenger and send private messages.
- Play online games.
- Follow company and brand news.
- Connect with public figures and celebrities.
- Use Facebook credentials to sign into other services.
- Make live video broadcasts.
- Manage privacy settings to control content visibility.

#### OSINT and Facebook

The vast amount of personal information and social interactions available on Facebook makes it a goldmine for open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering. However, the effectiveness of this depends on the privacy settings of the target user. Many studies indicate that a significant number of Facebook users do not pay much attention to privacy settings.

#### Data Volume on Facebook

As of March 2017, Facebook stored approximately 300 petabytes of data. Every minute, users post 510,000 comments, update 293,000 statuses, and upload 136,000 photos. To navigate this vast amount of data, Facebook has developed its own advanced search mechanism, known as Graph Search.

### Facebook Graph Search

Graph Search, introduced in early 2013, is a semantic search engine that allows users to find information using natural language queries. For example, you can type "Pages liked by my friends" to see a list of pages liked by your friends, or "Pages liked by [username]" to see a list of pages liked by a specific user.

#### Setting Up Graph Search

To use Graph Search, you need to:
1. Log in to your Facebook account.
2. Click the down arrow at the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Select "Settings."
4. Click "Languages" on the left side of the page.
5. Set the language to English (US).

#### Example Queries

- **People**: "People named [FirstName LastName] who live in [City, State]"
- **Professions**: "People who are [Profession Name] and live in [City, State]"
- **Pages**: "Pages named [Name]"
- **Posts**: "Posts liked by people who like [Page]"

#### Advanced Queries

- **Photos**: To find photos liked by a target, use: `https://www.facebook.com/search/[ProfileID]/photos-liked`
- **Places**: To see places visited by a target, use: `https://www.facebook.com/search/[ProfileID]/places-visited`
- **Friends**: To see a target's friend list, use: `https://www.facebook.com/search/[ProfileID]/friends`

### Other Useful Tips

- **Google Search**: Use the `site:facebook.com` operator to limit Google searches to Facebook.
- **Hashtags**: Search for hashtags by entering: `https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/[Hashtag]`
- **Automated Services**: Websites like Stalkscan (https://stalkscan.com) and Graph (http://graph.tips) can help automate advanced searches.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, investigators can effectively gather and analyze information from Facebook.
