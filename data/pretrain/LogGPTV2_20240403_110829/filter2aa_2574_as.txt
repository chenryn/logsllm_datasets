people will find such reviews useful to aid them in their buying 
decisions. The most popular review sites are Yelp (https://www.
yelp.com) and Angie’s List (www.angieslistbusinesscenter.com).
 Popular Social Networking Sites
Not all social media sites have the same popularity among users worldwide. Figure 5-3 
shows statistics published by Statista.com in September 2017 listing the most popular 
social media sites ranked by number of active users (in millions). The nature of social 
media sites is changing rapidly, so such statistics are expected to change frequently 
during the course of the year. However, the major players are expected to continue 
dominating the social media market for the near future.

 Investigating Social Media Sites
In this section, we discuss the most popular social media sites and demonstrate how 
to conduct a smarter search on each one to extract useful and hidden information 
that cannot be fetched using each site’s standard search function. The focus will be on 
social networking sites because searching within multimedia content was covered in 
the previous chapter. These sites contain a wealth of personal information and social 
interactions that can be useful for online investigations.
 Facebook
Facebook (www.facebook.com) is the most popular social networking site with the 
largest active user base on Earth. Facebook has currently more than 2 billion active users 
worldwide. Facebook is an American company; founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, 
it was originally developed for Harvard University students to share social information. 
However, it expanded its membership later to accept students from different U.S. 
universities. In 2006, Facebook allowed anyone—older than 13 years old with a valid 
email address—to become a registered member and use its service.

Facebook is so popular that anyone who have an Internet connection worldwide 
is expected to have a Facebook account! Facebook facilitates sharing different types 
of online content (images, videos, text messages, live broadcast, check-ins) between 
people, which is what makes it popular among varied user groups around the globe.
A lot of information can be found in each Facebook user account. For instance, to create 
a Facebook account, you need to supply your email (or phone number) as a username, a 
password, your date of birth, and your gender. After creating and activating your Facebook 
account, you can add more information about yourself such as work and education 
information, places you have lived in, contact information (email, phone number, address, 
a public key for receiving encrypted messages), religious and political views, languages, 
other social accounts (Twitter and LinkedIn), your personal blog or website, family and 
relationships, and other information about you in addition to live events.
Facebook allows its registered users to do different social interactions such as the 
following:
• 
Share updates, photos, videos, and geolocation data (e.g., your 
current location using the check-in feature) with friends
• 
See friends’ updates/posts, respond with comments, and like or share 
their updates
• 
Invite your friends to join groups and attend events
• 
Chat using Facebook Messenger and send direct private messages to 
another Facebook member
• 
Play online games within your web browser (multiplayers games are 
supported)
• 
Follow company/brand news
• 
Make connections with your favorite actors, celebrities, and other 
public entities
• 
Use Facebook account credentials to sign into different services 
across the Web
• 
Make live video broadcasts using Facebook Live (https://live.fb.com)
• 
Get Facebook support, which implements a variety of privacy settings 
on all content published by its users to restrict content visibility 
according to each user need
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
213
As noted, the sum of personal information and social interactions available publicly 
on Facebook provides a wealth of information for any OSINT gathering. As we already 
said, gathering personal information from Facebook about any target is dependent on 
the privacy controls set for their updates and social interactions. However, many studies 
show that the majority of Facebook users do not give much thought to privacy issues 
when using this platform.
The data volume stored within the Facebook database is huge. Facebook stores 
about 300 petabytes of data (in March 2017).vii This is equal to 300,000,000 gigabytes. 
Every minute on Facebook, 510,000 comments are posted, 293,000 statuses are updated, 
and 136,000 photos are uploaded.viii To locate information within this jungle, Facebook 
has developed its own search mechanism to simplify searching for different content 
types generated by its users’ interactions, and this what we will cover in the next section.
 Facebook Graph Search
Facebook offers an advanced semantic search engine to locate anything within its 
database by using natural English language phrases and keywords. This semantic 
search engine is called Graph Search and was first introduced in early 2013; it allows 
Facebook users to type in their queries in the Facebook search box to return accurate 
results based on their questions/phrases or combined keywords. The returned results 
are quite informative and different from the traditional search approach, which works 
by returning lists of links based on searched keywords only. For example, you can type 
Pages liked by my friends and Facebook will return a list of pages liked by all your 
friends list, or you can simply type Pages liked by ********, replacing the asterisks with 
the target’s Facebook username, to return a list of pages liked by the specified user.
Note! You must have a Facebook account to conduct the searches used in this 
chapter. it is advisable to use a dummy email account when creating this account 
to avoid revealing your true identity when conducting advanced searches on 
Facebook (specifically applicable to law enforcement).
Warning! Facebook policy prohibits opening accounts with false identities. take 
this into consideration when using visible Facebook data for a lawsuit.

Now, to use the Facebook Graph Search, you need first to sign into your Facebook 
account and then change your account language settings to use the English language 
(US). After doing this, your account is ready to use Facebook Graph Search. To change 
your Facebook account language, follow these steps:
 1. Log in to your Facebook account and click the down arrow shown 
at the top-right corner of your screen.
 2. Click Settings to access the account settings where you can change 
all your Facebook account settings (see Figure 5-4).
 3. Click Languages on the left side of the page, and make sure that 
the option “What language do you want to use Facebook in?” is set 
to English (US), as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-4. Accessing Facebook account settings
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
215
After updating your Facebook account to use the English (US) language and thus 
activating Graph Search, you can type in Facebook search bar anything you want to 
search for. For instance, you can search for people, your target’s friends, places (towns, 
countries, historical places), things, photos, pages, groups, apps, events, and restaurants, 
in addition to entertainment such as music, movies or games. Once your search criteria 
is entered into the search bar, Facebook will show a list of suggestions; you can either 
select something from the list or opt for your entered one (see Figure 5-6).

Knowing how to use Facebook Graph Search is important for online investigators 
to exploit Facebook’s repository of data. Each Facebook account—or page—is linked 
to its user social interactions (like, tag, share, friends list, work, university/school and 
education information, movie, song, events, geolocation data, and locations). The 
investigator has to type the right search query to fetch such results. In a nutshell, Graph 
Search helps you to map each Facebook account to its associated activities on Facebook.
Now we’ll give some examples of Facebook Graph Search queries to activate your 
imagination on how to build different search queries to extract accurate results from 
Facebook.
To search for people on Facebook, use these queries:
• 
Peoples named [FirstName LastName] who live in [City, State]. Here’s 
an example: people named Nihad Hassan who live in Buffalo, 
New York.
• 
People who live in [city, state] and are [single/married] and like 
[something]. Here’s an example: people who work in Seattle, 
Washington and are single and like Lebanese restaurants.
• 
People who are [Profession Name] and live in [City, State]. Here’s an 
example: People who are Programmer and live in London, UK.
• 
People who like [Page Name] and live in [Place]. Here’s an example: 
people who like apress and live in New York, USA.
• 
People who work at [Company]. Here’s an example: people who 
work at Apress. This query can be refined to search for people 
working at the Apress company as authors: people who work at 
Apress as author (see Figure 5-7).
• 
People who live in [Country] and like [Page Name]. Here’s an 
example: people who live in USA and like Al-Qaeda.

To search for specific pages on Facebook, try the following queries:
• 
Pages named [Name]. Here’s an example: pages named Al-Qaeda.
• 
Pages liked by [Name]. Here’s an example: Pages liked by Mark 
Zuckerberg.
• 
Pages liked by [Profession]. Here’s an example: pages liked by 
teachers.
To search for professions, businesses, or services, try the following search queries:
• 
Dentist in [City]. Here’s an example: Dentist in Manhattan, 
New York.
• 
[Profession Name] named [Name]. Here’s an example: Teachers 
named John Walker.
To search for posts, use these:
• 
Posts liked by people who like [Page]. Here’s an example: Posts liked 
by people who like Apress.
• 
Posts liked by people who live in [city, state] and work at [company]. 
Here’s an example: Posts liked by people who live in Dallas, Texas 
and work at Google.
• 
Posts by [FirstName LastName] from year. Here’s an example: Posts 
by Nihad Hassan from the year 2011.
Tip! Monitoring a target’s “post time” on Facebook may reveal what time the 
person wakes up each day.
Note! Using Facebook graph Search may return a large number of results. to 
refine your search results, you can use the graph Search filters on the left side of 
the page (see Figure 5-8).
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
218
To use the advanced Facebook Graph Search, you need to know the target’s 
Facebook profile ID (pages and groups also have their own IDs). To get the target’s 
Facebook profile ID manually, do the following:
 1. Go to the target’s Facebook page, right-click the page and select 
View Page Source (see Figure 5-9).
Figure 5-8. The Facebook Graph Search filters help you to refine your  
search results
Chapter 5  SoCial Media intelligenCe
219
 2. Press Ctrl+F (in IE, Firefox, Chrome, or Opera) to search within 
the HTML source code. Enter profile_id as the search criteria.  
The number beside it is the target Facebook unique profile ID  
(see Figure 5-10).
After knowing how to find target Facebook profile ID (the same applies to Facebook 
pages and groups), let’s use it to find a list of publicly viewable photos of a target. This 
time, you will insert your search query in a browser’s address bar instead of using the 
Facebook search bar.
A Graph Search web address always starts with this: https://www.facebook.com/
search/.
To search for photos liked by a target Facebook user, type the query shown in 
Figure 5-11 in a browser’s address bar (the highlighted number points to the target’s 
Facebook profile ID).

In the same way, you can modify the query to return photos commented on or 
tagged by the target user.
Note! replace the number 100003886582037 with your target Facebook profile 
id in all the following queries.
Use https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/photos-commented to 
find photos commented on by the target.
Use https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/photos-tagged to find 
all photos tagged with a target profile.
The photos-of query returns all photos uploaded by the target’s profile in addition to 
all photos where the target was tagged or mentioned; consider this query as a container 
for showing all publicly available photos of a target profile: https://www.facebook.com/
search/100003886582037/photos-of.
Note! Facebook photo queries also work for Videos. replace photos with 
videos in your search query.
To see a list of places visited by your target profile, use this: https://www.facebook.
com/search/100003886582037/places-visited.
To see a list of places liked by target profile, use this: https://www.facebook.com/
search/100003886582037/places-liked.
To see a list of places checked in at, use this: https://www.facebook.com/
search/100003886582037/places-checked-in.
To see the target’s friend list (if it is set to public), use the following: https://www.
facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends. This will also reveal when each 
Facebook friendship began (see Figure 5-12).

221
To see a list of events attended by target profile, use this: https://www.facebook.
com/search/100003886582037/events-joined.
If your target Facebook account has not restricted their friend list from public view, 
you can also conduct the following queries on your target Facebook friends:
• 
To see a list of photos uploaded by target friends, type the following 
query: https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/
friends/photos-uploaded.
• 
To see a list of photos liked by target friends, use this:  https://www.
facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends/photos-liked.
• 
To see a list of photos commented on by target friends, use this: 
https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends/
photos-commented.
• 
To see the places visited by target friends, use this https://www.
facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends/places-visited.
• 
To see the friends of target friends, use this:  https://www.facebook.
com/search/100003886582037/friends/friends.

222
Note! Before using Facebook graph Search, always begin your search on 
Facebook using your target’s full name (if you have it). although Facebook prohibits 
registering with false names, there is a great number of Facebook accounts with 
false names, so you cannot always depend on searching by name. as a second 
option, try to search using the target’s Facebook email address and phone number 
(if you have them). please note that searching using email and phone numbers 
will return no results if the target’s privacy control is set to prevent them from 
appearing on Facebook search. if nothing gives you the required results, try to 
access the target target’s known associate profiles; you may find something that 
can help you to find your target’s real profile.
 Other Useful Facebook Graph Search Commands
To search for all people who like a specific page on Facebook, type the query shown in 
Figure 5-13 in your browser address bar, replacing the highlighted number with your 
target page profile ID.
 Tracking Photos Downloaded from Facebook to Its Source Profile
When a user uploads a photo to Facebook, its name will get changed upon saving it in the 
Facebook database. The new name will usually consist of three long numbers, and the 
file will be in the JPG format. The second number is relevant to the Facebook profile that 
upload this image to Facebook originally. To know the source Facebook account behind 
this image, copy the second number and paste it after Facebook web address  
www.facebook.com/. This should take you to the source Facebook profile (see Figure 5- 14).  
For this tip to work, the image of interest should be posted publicly or your Facebook 
account must be a friend of the target profile if the image was originally shared with the 
friend circle.

Note! Many Facebook users use the same profile photo across different social 
platforms. to conduct a reverse image search to see where a particular Facebook 
profile photo appears online, use a service like google images (https://
images.google.com) or tineye (www.tineye.com).

 Using Google to Search Facebook Content
Google can be used effectively to search within Facebook public pages using the 
site:facebook.com search operator, which limits a Google search to a specified website 
only. Other Google advanced search operators—already covered in Chapter 4—can be 
used to locate accurate information within Facebook. See Figure 5-15 for an example.
 Search for Hashtags on Facebook
To search for posts, photos, or pages that have hashtags, type the Facebook address into 
the web browser address bar followed by the specified hashtag, as in https://www.
facebook.com/hashtag.
For example, entering https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/Terrorism will display 
related contents on Facebook that carry the #Terrorism hashtag.
Tip! You can search multiple social media sites (Facebook, twitter, pinterest, 
instagram) for a specific hashtag by going to https://www.hashatit.com.
 Using Automated Services to Facilitate Facebook Graph Search
Searching using Facebook Graph Search is easy; you need to use your imagination and 
create queries that best suit your needs. There are online services that facilitate using 
Graph Search; all you need to do is to enter target Facebook username or profile ID, and 
the online service will conduct the advanced search queries—already discussed—for 
you (of course, only public viewable information will appear). The following are the most 
popular Facebook Graph Search generators.

Facebook Scanner
This website (https://stalkscan.com) allows you to investigate the public information 
of any Facebook user. To use this service, enter the Facebook URL of the target profile, 
and the site will populate the page with all the public social interactions produced by the 
profile of interest (see Figure 5-16).
Graph
This site (http://graph.tips) offers a simple graphical user interface to use the 
Facebook Graph Search to locate public information about any Facebook user. You 
need to supply the target’s Facebook username (which can be extracted from visiting 
the target’s Facebook profile page, as shown in Figure 5-17), and the website will do the 
remaining work for you.
