The `traceback` is always a string, and `children` is a list. An error occurred during the decoding process. Attempts were made to set the serializer to both JSON and pickle, but the results were the same.

### Error Details
```python
File "msgpack_unpacker.pyx", line 178, in msgpack._cmsgpack.unpackb
File "msgpack_unpacker.pyx", line 126, in msgpack._cmsgpack.get_data_from_buffer
kombu.exceptions.DecodeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```

### Code Snippet
The error occurs in the following code block from `celery/celery/backends/mongodb.py`:

```python
def meta_from_decoded(self, obj):
    return self.meta_from_decoded({
        'task_id': obj['_id'],
        'status': obj['status'],
        'result': self.decode(obj['result']),
        'date_done': obj['date_done'],
        'traceback': self.decode(obj['traceback']),
        'children': self.decode(obj['children']),
    })
```

Specifically, the error is triggered by the line:
```python
'traceback': self.decode(obj['traceback']),
```

Thank you for your assistance.
