User: I try to use virtualenv inside a folder using the command virtualenv . and getting the error -bash: virtualenv: command not found. However, I installed virtualenv using pip pip installed virtualenv and also, upgraded it earlier with sudo pip install virtualenv. 
How to use virtualenv properly ? I'm following a tutorial and they seems doing the same and gets away with it. I'm a Java developer with beginner knowledge of Python and working to improve it.
Assistant: This is pretty simpleJust goto environment folder
Try: Scripts/activate
This will activate the environment
Try:Scripts/deactivate
This will deactivate current environment
