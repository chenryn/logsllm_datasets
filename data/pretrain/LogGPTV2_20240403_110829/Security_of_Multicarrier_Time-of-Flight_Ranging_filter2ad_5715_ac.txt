3.5 ED/LC attack
We have presented independent strategies for early-detection and
late-commit. This section deals with how an attacker can com-
bine these elements into a successful distance-reduction attack.
This combination is characterized by a transition step from early-
detection to late-commit. An ED/LC attack consists of independent
stages for detection and late-commit, separated by the attacker’s
reduction target. We propose three fundamental strategies for tran-
sitioning from early-detection to late-commit. The first uses the

symbol requires at most ns/4 + 1 samples for early-detection. To-
gether with the offset required for the shift operation, we arrive at
ns/4 + ns/4 + 1 = ns/2 + 1 samples for ideal early-detection of the
non-pulsed 4-QAM symbol.
□
The same separation strategy for frequency-domain I and Q
components can be applied irrespective of constellation density. Our
main insight from the number-theoretic analysis is that, without
assumptions on an attacker’s sensitivity, even early samples contain
a substantial amount of differential information about the entire
symbol which, due to the structure of the constellation, directly
translates to information about the symbol bits.
3.4 Late-commit
The late-commit problem for the attacker consists in finding a
sequence of samples that result in the correct symbol at the receiver
under a delayed onset of transmission. For a given symbol, the
ability of an attacker to late-commit with a certain delay is not
probabilistic but an immutable property of this symbol.
The fundamental principle behind late-committing to a symbol
is reflected by the fact that the attacker does not have to provide
a signal that is actually close on the physical layer (e.g., in the L2-
sense), but only one that creates the correct bits at the receiver. In
general, finding a valid late-commit sequence for an OFDM symbols
is not straightforward. There is room for optimization on a per-
symbol basis beyond just sending the late part of the symbol, as we
illustrate in Figure 8.
Irrespective of the optimization technique, for a given symbol
sequence b and transmission delay δlc, the goal of the attacker is to
find a late-commit signal clc consisting of ns − δlc samples that, if

Interleaved ED/LC. This is the most generalized model with
3.5.3
regards to the attacker’s transition from ED to LC. It assumes the at-
tacker continuous detects the legitimate symbol, even after starting
to transmit late-commit samples. In other terms, this is an attacker
that might start transmitting before getting a clear picture from
the early-detection, and adjust each transmitted samples to new
observations. This corresponds to the attacker model put forward
in [17].
3.6 Distance reduction attack
We evaluate the vulnerability of BPSK and 4-QAM OFDM to an
ED/LC distance-reduction attack by combining our findings for
early-detection and late-commit.
3.6.1 BPSK. BPSK OFDM is vulnerable to an ED/LC attack that
results in a deterministically successful distance reduction by a
physical-layer attacker under the fixed transition model. We have
proven that the attacker requires only half the samples for success-
ful late-commit and a quarter of the samples for early-detection.
This means the attack succeeds irrespective of asymptotic proper-
ties on the bit- and frame level (i.e., independently of the quality
of entropy of the message bits and how many messages are ex-
changed).
Corollary 3.4. An (ideal) attacker operating on a non-pulsed
BPSK OFDM symbol can achieve a distance reduction corresponding
to up to ns/4 − 1 samples deterministically.
Proof. Theorem 3.3 states that for any non-pulsed BPSK OFDM
symbol, there exists an ns/2-LC algorithm. Theorem 3.1 states
that an attacker requires up to ns/4 + 1 samples to detect a non-
pulsed BPSK OFDM symbol ideally. This leaves an attacker with
ns/2 − (ns/4 + 1) = ns/4 − 1 samples for distance reduction with
A = 1 under the fixed transition model.
□
Table 1 exemplifies the impact of the sample-level advancement
on time and distance. For the numerical example, we assume a
system bandwidth of 20MHz, split into various numbers of sub-
carriers. The sample spacing is determined as the inverse of the
system bandwidth. We observe a higher impact for systems with
more and narrower subcarriers, e.g., the typical configuration for
an IEEE 802.11 system consisting of 64 subcarriers is vulnerable

we propose an adversarial strategy that is more general, without a
strict transition.
Fixed transition. This attacker uses a fixed portion of each
3.5.1
symbol for early-detection and late-commit. This corresponds to
an attacker that does not pre-generate all late-commit signals in
advance but generates the signal on the fly and transmits it at the
earliest time required for any symbol in the symbol set. The latest
late-commit time of any symbol in the message set will therefore be
considered a strict upper bound for the delay at which the attacker
has to guess the symbol under a given target for distance reduction.
The resulting adversarial advantage can be expressed in terms
of the early-detection advantage, as

Symbol-adaptive transition. This attacker incrementally learns
3.5.2
about the symbol and uses this knowledge to optimize the start
time of the late-commit attack. For this purpose, the attacker can
be thought to maintain an uncertainty-set of symbols at each stage
of the early-detection process and chooses the late-commit time
to satisfy the lowest late-commit delay within this set. This way,
the attacker optimizes the late-commit start time subject to his
knowledge gained from early-detection. This behavior requires the
attacker to pre-generate a significant fraction of all late-commit
symbols in order to generate statistics on the latest possible late-
commit delays subject to every symbol. The adversarial advantage
under this model is bounded by the attacker’s ability to correctly
guess the symbol at the latest possible transmission time, given a
certain reduction goal:
A(B, δadv) ≤ Eb←B

As an over-approximation of the attacker, we can consider above
at equality. This corresponds to an attacker never waiting too long

to a distance reduction of up to 225m if BPSK is used. It becomes
evident that, under a fixed system bandwidth, higher numbers of
subcarriers come at a loss for secure ToF measurement due to the
fact that the symbol duration is increased.
4-QAM. Corollary 3.2 states that an attacker requires only
3.6.2
ns/2+1 samples to ideally detect a 4-QAM symbol. The late-commit
profile shown in Figure 9 shows that a late-committing attacker
achieves a BER of below 10% at the half-symbol mark. Together this
indicates that a significant adversarial advantage remains for per-
forming a distance-reduction attack, even under the fixed-transition
model. Because the learning curve for early-detection is steep, i.e.,
the sample with index ns/4 + 3 already reveals more than 90%
of the symbol information, there is also a potential for an inter-
leaved strategy, which would likely further reduce the adversarial
bit-error-rate.
4 CAN OFDM BE SECURED?
After identifying the major problems with secure ranging based
on OFDM, this section proposes a potential direction for securing
OFDM-based ranging. The underlying observation is that the pos-
sible set of constellation points can be randomized and extended to
cover a continuous disk in the IQ plane, minimizing an adversary’s
structural knowledge about the modulation.
4.1 Continuous extension of constellation
We can increase the constellation density on the transmit-side
by limiting the modulation to one dimension and adding a noise
dimension to each tone. The rationale is to increase the numerical
diversity of the resulting time-domain samples.
In addition, we can add a random phase shift to each tone that
is pre-shared and inverted by the receiver before demodulation.
Phase randomization is a common technique for PAPR reduction,
i.e., existing hardware is expected to implement it. This approach
leverages the same procedure for security against early detection.
The random phase offsets create a dense, concentric constellation
pattern if jointly applied with orthogonal noise and a denser than
minimal constellation set (e.g., eight constellation points in the in-
formation dimension). If we move beyond BPSK for the information
dimension, the resulting frequency-domain constellation covers a
concentric disk. We can choose orthogonal noise and phase offset
at an arbitrarily fine resolution without any impact on performance.
This leaves an attacker with minimal a-priori numerical knowledge,
only a lower and upper bound on each tone’s amplitude.
4.2 Evaluation
We analyze our proposal, consisting of eight constellation points
in the information dimension, together with orthogonal noise and
phase randomization, in terms of its security against early-detection.
Information-theoretic security against ED. Phase random-

ization together with fine-grained orthogonal noise can provide
information-theoretic security against an early-detecting attacker.
The fundamental reason that any point in a continuous area in
the IQ-plane is a valid value for each frequency-domain sample.
This means, any partial time-domain sequence can be continued in
many ways such that each tone ends up within the valid range. This

uncertainty is associated with a certain bit error rate. We verified
this in a simulation, where we randomly sampled valid continua-
tion (vc) sequences for many different symbols and evaluated their
resulting bit-error rate, as shown in Figure 10. We contrast them to
zero-extended (zc) symbols and see no difference in the resulting
bit error rate.
5 DISCUSSION
In the following, we cover the main avenues that can be taken to
secure OFDM signals against an ED/LC attacker and highlight a few
additional OFDM features that are linked to physical-layer security.
5.1 Preventing LC: ICI sensitivity
Late-commit detection is enabled by a receiver’s ability to detect
deviations from the expected signal shape.
5.1.1 Utilizing both signal-space dimensions. Utilizing both signal-
space dimensions in frequency domain breaks up the symmetry of
the time-domain signal around symbol center and is, therefore, a
necessity against both early-detection and late-commit.
5.1.2 Denser Constellation. Late-commit attacks become less effec-
tive if information is modulated on a denser constellation grid. As
a consequence, late-commit needs to start earlier, as inter-carrier-
interference has more impact. The denser the constellation, the
less dispersion can be tolerated for correct detection. In general,
denser constellations and increased throughput come at a tension
with robustness, a requirement which is especially important since
cyclic prefix and channel compensation cannot be used for security
reasons.
5.1.3 Error integration. A possible way to resolve this tension is
to map the signal into a denser constellation at the receiver and
then post-process the received bits in a way that approximates the
L2 distance to the expected spectrum (and selecting an appropriate
symbol-wide decision threshold). This way, significant deviations
of only a few tones can be weighted accordingly, and late-commit
strategies that optimize for low bit-error rate under a coarse con-
stellation mapping lose their utility.

5.2 Secure time-domain signals over OFDM
Due to inherent drawbacks of OFDM for secure ranging, i.e., the
countermeasure requiring additional power for a noise dimension,
and significant shared entropy for phase correction, it might be
of use to retrofit OFDM transceivers with time-domain modula-
tion capability. One such proposal is the use of DFT-spread OFDM.
Outside of OFDMA, this just means to precode the IQ values as
spectrum of a time-domain signal. This results in similar properties
of the signal to any time-domain pulsed modulation.
A way to create secure time-domain signals without need for
additional DFT blocks is to transmit a single pulse per symbol, as
in [25]. This can be achieved by using identical tones (of a certain
polarity) and verifying correctness either by a time-domain tech-
nique or, alternatively, evaluating the Hamming weight per symbol
at the receiver (serving as approximation for the polarity of a con-
strained pulse in time-domain). The drawback of this approach is
its data rate, i.e., one symbol can only transmit one bit and a longer
series of ranging symbols has to be exchanged.
5.3 Other aspects
Different mechanisms that are commonly used for enhancing per-
formance of OFDM systems can have a detrimental impact on
physical-layer security.
5.3.1 Channel sensing and equalization. A secure ranging imple-
mentation based on OFDM cannot rely on channel sensing and
equalization. Channel sensing can be manipulated by an attacker,
which brings equalization under adversarial control. Fundamentally,
channel compensation is about compensation of time-dispersion,
which leads delayed signal components being included in the de-
coding.
5.3.2 Cyclic prefix. The cyclic prefix, commonly applied on OFDM
