from the gateway, as shown in Figure 3.
If we assign all
nodes within the same level the same two channels and let
nodes on adjacent levels share one channel in common, all
paths to the gateway can operate on distinct channels, elim-
inating intra-path interference. In Figure 3, nodes A,D be-
long to the same level and assign themselves channels c1, c2
and nodes B,E use channels c2, c3. As a result, all multi-hop
gateway paths, such as G-A-B-C, can use diﬀerent channels
for each of their links.
It may appear counter-intuitive why ROMA assigns the
same channels instead of diﬀerent ones to nodes at the same
level. This design choice is based on two considerations:
ﬁrst, there is little performance beneﬁt in assigning diﬀerent
channels to nodes at the same level since all paths ultimately
compete with each other at the ﬁrst hop of the gateway. Sec-
ond, there is an advantage in having the same channel as-
signments at the same level because it preserves many cross
links between paths to the same gateway. In the example
of Figure 3, links such as A-E and B-E would not exist had
nodes at the same level assigned themselves diﬀerent chan-
nels. When assigning channels with the goal of avoiding
interference, a multi-radio protocol tends to make the net-
work topology less dense, reducing chances for opportunistic
routing [9, 10]. By assigning the same channels to nodes at
the same level, ROMA preserves cross links whenever pos-
sible. These cross links are useful in opportunistic routing
and also help a node adapt to link condition changes quickly.
For example, if the existing route G-A-B-C degrades, node
C can use a diﬀerent route such as G-A-E-C without having
to change its channel assignment.
ROMA’s basic design: The basic channel assignment
strategy works as follows. Each gateway associates a chan-
nel sequence with each of its radios, e.g. c1, c2, c3, .... Ev-
ery non-gateway node in the network participates in a dis-
tributed routing protocol to discover its best gateway path
that is likely to yield good throughput according to ROMA’s
path metric. Since a gateway’s channel sequence is propa-
gated along with routing information in periodic route an-
nouncement messages, a node calculates the best path to the
gateway, such that the channels along this path satisfy the
gateway’s channel sequence. Thus, the node can assign ap-
propriate channels according to its gateway path length and
the gateway’s channel sequence. A node i hops away from
the gateway assigns channels (ci, ci+1) to its two radios. For
example in Figure 3, node C ﬁnds its best gateway path to
be G-A-B-C and assigns channels (c3, c4) according to G’s
channel sequence. Since the same sequence is used in as-
signing channels, nodes within the same hop distance away
from the same gateway radio end up using the same chan-
nels, thus realizing the desired ring-like conﬁguration shown
in Figure 3. Section 4 describes the distributed operations
of ROMA in more details.
101The simpliﬁed description of ROMA ignores many impor-
tant details. First, how does each node choose paths con-
sisting of high quality links with little external load? (Sec-
tion 3.2 and Section 3.3). Second, each dual-radio node must
operate its two radios at diﬀerent frequency bands. How
do we take into consideration of the topological diﬀerences
between 802.11a and 802.11b/g channels?
(Section 3.4).
Third, in the presence of multiple gateways, how should each
gateway choose its channel sequences to improve the aggre-
gate throughput of the network? (Section 3.5). Last, how
do we extend ROMA to work with more than two radios at
each node? (Section 3.6).
3.2 Calculating link metric
The most popular link metric today is ETX [14, 15] and
its extension ETT [7, 16]. Both metrics explicitly measure
the delivery ratio of a link and ETT is a scaled version of
ETX to adjust for diﬀerent link level transmission rates. In
our initial implementation of ROMA, we found that using
ETT often leads to suboptimal routing paths. Our improved
link metric incorporates two additional factors to estimate
the quality of a link: link variation and external load.
Many links exhibit highly variable delivery ratios on short
timescales. As a result, a path that should perform well
judging from its individual links’ ETTs often has low actual
throughput because the delivery ratio of some link along
the path happens to incur higher than average loss rate. We
modify the way standard ETT is calculated to account for
delivery ratio variations. In ROMA, each node keeps track
of two variables, pa and pv, which are exponentially weighted
moving averages (EWMA) of the average and mean devia-
tion of the link delivery ratio. Our method for calculating pa
and pv is inspired by the technique used for estimating RTT
in TCP [18]. Speciﬁcally, let p be the latest measurement of
the delivery ratio, pa and pv are updated as follows:
pa = pa + g · (p − pa)
pv = pv + g · (|p − pa| − pv)
a
1
·
(pa−pv )∗(p(cid:2)
(cid:3)
a and p
The parameter g represents the gain factor in EWMA and is
set to 0.2 in our implementation. Intuitively, if the delivery
ratio of a link has high variations as indicated by a large
pv, that link is more likely to exhibit much lower than aver-
age delivery ratio during the actual data transmissions. We
penalize links with high variations by calculating ETT to
be 1
−p(cid:2)
v ) , where r is the link level transmission
r
(cid:3)
rate and p
v are the average and mean deviation of
the link delivery ratio in the reverse direction. The higher
the link variation, the larger the corresponding ETT metric.
The throughput of a link is reduced by competing traﬃc
on the same channel. In a multi-radio mesh, a node can po-
tentially ﬁnd an alternative route on diﬀerent channels with
less competition. We explicitly measure the external load of
a link by having each node continuously snoop the medium
to record non-ROMA packets received, including those that
fail the MAC-level CRC check. Based on the transmission
rate and size of received packets, a node estimates the frac-
tion of time a channel is occupied by external transmis-
sions. Our calculation underestimates the actual external
load since some interference (e.g. overlapping channel in-
terference, non-802.11 interference) do not result in packet
reception. Similar to the modiﬁed ETT, a node keeps track
of both the average (La) and mean deviation (Lv) of its mea-
sured external load and calculates L = La + Lv (0 ≤ L ≤ 1).
The load of a link between two nodes is the maximum of the
estimated external load (L) at both nodes.
In ROMA, the link metric is represented by a pair of val-
ues, (ET T, L), which collectively characterize the perfor-
mance of a link due to loss and external load.
3.3 Choosing routes
In a multi-radio mesh, there is tension in choosing between
shorter paths with lower total transmission overhead (i.e.
smaller ETT sums) and longer paths consisting of better
performing links on diﬀerent channels. WECTT [16] and
SIM [13] are two path metrics that resolve such tension by
using a linear combination of the two factors. ROMA’s path
metric (M) extends the SIM metric [13] to take into account
external load and is calculated as follows:
X
M = (1 − β) · S + β · T
X
ET T (i)
i∈path
where S =
ET T (i) · (1 + L(i))
T = maxs
i∈Segs

(2)
(3)
The extended SIM metric (M ) is a linear combination of
path overhead (S) and performance (T ) with parameter β
balancing the tradeoﬀs between them. The path overhead S
is approximated by the sum of expected transmission time
along the path. The path performance (T ) is characterized
by the estimated service interval of the bottleneck path seg-
ment and a smaller T corresponds to better performance.
A path segment (Seg) consists of one or more links that
interfere with each other on overlapping channels.
In the
common case, links operate on distinct channels along the
gateway path and thus form path segments of length one.
The original SIM metric estimates the service interval of
the bottleneck path segment using the sum of ETT along
that segment [13]. In ROMA, the estimated service interval
of a link is its ETT weighted by the observed external load,
i.e. ET T · (1 + L). When the external load increases from
zero to near 1, the estimated service interval doubles. This
weighting approximates the expected service interval when
there is a single competitor that transmits as fast as possi-
ble and the underlying MAC fairly divides the channel time
among competing nodes. The weighting does not accurately
capture the service interval for multiple external competing
senders. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd it has worked well for ROMA
in practice.
P
Previous work [16, 13] choose the parameter β empirically.
Here, we present an analysis that bounds the path perfor-
mance (or overhead) for any given β. For any chosen path,
its total transmission time (S) is greater than that of the
worst path segment, i.e. S ≥ maxs
ET T (i) ≥ T /2.
Furthermore, the total transmission time (S) cannot exceed
the product of the total number of path segments (h) and
the estimated service interval of the bottleneck segment (T ),
i.e. S ≤ hT . Therefore, we obtain T /2 ≤ S ≤ hT . Substi-
tuting this inequality back to Equation (1) and simplifying,
we obtain the best and worse possible path performance (or
overhead) for any M :

than that on channel a1. We assume no external load.

The above inequalities make the tradeoﬀ between path
performance (T ) and overhead (S) explicit. In a small mesh
network where most paths have no more than 4 hops (h ≤ 4),
2(4−3β) of the
the performance of any chosen path is at least
best performing path with an identical path metric. Like-
wise, the chosen path’s overhead is at most 4(1+β)
4−3β times the
lowest overhead. Since ROMA’s primary goal is to achieve
good path throughput, we set β = 0.8 so that any chosen
2(4−3∗0.8) = 0.56 of the best
path’s performance is at least
possible performance. The corresponding path overhead will
be no more than 4.5 times the lowest possible overhead.
3.4 Using 11b/g and 11a channels robustly
1+0.8
A compact dual-radio node must assign channels from dif-
ferent frequency bands in order to avoid the cross-channel
interference that result from radios operating within close
range of each other. In ROMA, such a constraint is easily
achieved by letting each gateway use a sequence of alternat-
ing 802.11b/g and 802.11a channels, e.g. b1, a1, b2, a2, .... As
a result, each node along the gateway path can operate its
two radios on a 802.11b/g channel and a 802.11a channel
without interference.
There is considerable topological diﬀerences between
802.11a and 802.11b/g channels. In particular, links under
802.11b/g channels have much longer range than those on
802.11a channels due to the fact that 802.11b/g is at a lower
frequency band and that 802.11b standard permits lower and
more robust transmission rates (e.g. 1 or 2 Mbps). To op-
erate robustly despite such topological diﬀerences, a node
must be ﬂexible in following a gateway sequence so that it is
not forced to communicate using a very weak or non-existent
link. Figure 4 gives an example. Node B is connected to A
over a very weak link on channel a1 but a perfect link on b1.
If it were to assign channels strictly according to G’s chan-
nel sequence (b1, a1, ...), it would be forced to communicate
with A over the weak a1 channel. ROMA deals with this
situation by giving a node the alternative to assign identical
channels as its previous hop neighbor.
The path metric in Equation(1) helps a node decide
whether to advance to the next tuple in the channel se-
quence or to use the same assignment as its previous hop.
When using the same assignment, a node’s gateway path
incurs intra-path interference, resulting in a bigger T .
In
Figure 4, successive links G-A and A-B operate on the same
channel if B’s channel assignment is (b1, a1), thus T = 2 and
M = 0.1 ∗ S + 0.9 ∗ T = 2. On the other hand, if B is to
use (a1, b2), T = max(1, 10) = 10 and M =10.1. Because the
ﬁrst assignment achieves a gateway path with smaller path
metric, node B ends up using channels (b1, a1).
3.5 Choosing channel sequences
The simpliﬁed design in Section 3.1 focuses on a single
gateway with one radio. In the single gateway radio case,
ROMA’s main objective is to eliminate intra-path interfer-
ence along all gateway paths. In scenarios where a gateway
has more than one radio or multiple gateways co-exist, gate-
ways should choose channel sequences carefully to reduce
inter-path interference.
Aggregate throughput is improved when ﬂows destined
for diﬀerent gateways’ radios utilize diﬀerent channels.
A single gateway with two radios uses two sequences
b1, a1, b2, a2, b3, a3 and a2, b3, a3, b1, a1, b2 so that ﬂows with
three or fewer hops destined for diﬀerent radios at the same
gateway do not interfere. When there are multiple gate-
ways, it is impossible to assign sequences so that ﬂows using
diﬀerent sequences do not interfere because there are only
three non-overlapping 802.11b/g channels. We use a simple
heuristic targeted at minimizing the interference of ﬁrst hop
transmissions at diﬀerent gateway radios since the ﬁrst hop
performance is typically the bottleneck with multiple ﬂows.
Upon startup, a gateway node scans all three 802.11b/g
channels for a period of time to learn of existing gateways’
channel assignments. Subsequently, it chooses gateway se-
quences whose ﬁrst hop channels diﬀer from those chosen
by potentially interfering gateways. For example, if a new
gateway overhears the channel sequences of another gateway
as b1, a1, b2, a2, b3, a3 and a2, b3, a3, b1, a1, b2, it will choose
to use sequences b2, a4, b3, a5, b1, a6 and a5, b1, a6, b2, a4, b3.
Since a gateway largely ignores the actual network topol-
ogy in choosing channel sequences, the resulting channel se-
quence may not be optimal. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that this
simple approach works well in practice.
In deployed mesh access networks, each node acts as both
a mesh forwarder and an AP for unmodiﬁed single-radio
clients. It is desirable for the link between a client and its
associated AP to follow the corresponding gateway channel
sequence to avoid intra-path interference. If other words, if a
mesh node operates on channels (a1, b1) and uses channel a1
for its gateway path, it should make its clients preferentially
associate itself on channel b1 instead of a1. This can be
achieved in the case of unmodiﬁed clients using techniques
similar to those described in [28].
3.6 Extending beyond dual-radio nodes
ROMA can be extended naturally to handle m-radio
nodes (m ≥ 3). One can build such nodes today by sep-
arating antennas far apart enough to avoid interference. In
the future, extra bands other than the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
ranges could open up for use by commodity 802.11 radios so
that one can build compact m-radio nodes.
For a compact m-radio mesh, a gateway sequence should
be made up of channels from alternating bands such that
each node will assign channels from distinct bands. To ex-
tend ROMA to the m-radio case, we follow a channel as-
signment approach similar to the dual-radio case. Given a
gateway channel sequence, if a node’s best gateway path
uses channel ci to its previous hop neighbor, it would assign
channels ci−m/2, .., ci, .., ci+m/2 to each of its radios based
on the gateway sequence. Such an assignment preserves
103dense network connectivities among nodes that follow the
same gateway sequence. While this is a natural extension to
the multi-radio case, one unaddressed challenge is how such
an extension compares with alternative assignment strate-
gies such as letting each node follow multiple gateway se-
