User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Making sense of the 'last -x' command's output I am trying to track when the server was rebooted or shutdown. I used w and uptime to see how long it's been up but also used last -x to get a log of times when the server went down. Here is the output:

    runlevel (to lvl 2)   2.6.26-2-686     Wed Sep 14 09:38 - 10:22  (00:43)    
    reboot   system boot  2.6.26-2-686     Wed Sep 14 09:38 - 10:22  (00:43)    
    keenan   pts/1                         Tue Sep 13 16:07 - crash  (17:31)    
    keenan   pts/1                         Tue Sep 13 15:20 - 15:21  (00:01)    
    keenan   pts/2                         Mon Sep 12 14:51 - 09:16  (18:24)


I'm confused about the last column and what the time represented there means.

Assistant: For actual user sessions, the time in parentheses is the duration of the login session in hours and minutes. For sessions lasting more than a day, it will be in the form "d+hh:mm", where "d" is the number of days.

For the non-user entries, the time is actually the system's current uptime. Compare it to the output of uptime to see. From a CentOS 5.6 system:

$ last -x | egrep 'runlevel|reboot|shutdown'
runlevel (to lvl 3)   2.6.18-238.19.1. Thu Sep  8 11:38 - 09:15 (5+21:37)
reboot   system boot  2.6.18-238.19.1. Thu Sep  8 11:38         (5+21:37)
shutdown system down  2.6.18-238.el5   Thu Sep  8 11:37 - 09:15 (5+21:37)

$ uptime
 09:15:32 up 5 days, 21:37,  2 users,  load average: 0.23, 0.21, 0.18
