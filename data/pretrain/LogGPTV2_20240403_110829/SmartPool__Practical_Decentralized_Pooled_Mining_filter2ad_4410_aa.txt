## Abstract

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are predominantly operated by a few mining pools. Nearly 95% of Bitcoin's and 80% of Ethereum's mining power is controlled by fewer than ten and six mining pools, respectively. While pooled mining benefits miners with lower payout variance, it requires them to trust pool operators for fair remuneration. Centralized pools also pose risks of transaction censorship and collusion, potentially leading to severe attacks.

In this work, we introduce SmartPool, a novel decentralized mining pool protocol. SmartPool leverages smart contracts, autonomous blockchain programs, to decentralize cryptocurrency mining. It returns transaction selection control to miners while providing low-variance payouts. SmartPool incurs lower mining fees than centralized pools and is designed to scale to a large number of miners. We implemented and deployed a robust SmartPool on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. Our deployed pools have handled a peak hashrate of 30 GH/s from Ethereum miners, resulting in 105 blocks, with miners paying only 0.6% of block rewards in transaction fees.

## 1. Introduction

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer a digital currency system without a centralized issuer or trusted operator. These networks maintain a distributed ledger of transactions, agreed upon by a large number of computation nodes (miners). The most widely used consensus protocol is Nakamoto consensus, which rewards a miner every epoch (e.g., 10 minutes in Bitcoin) who solves a probabilistic computation puzzle called a "proof-of-work" (PoW) puzzle. The winning miner's solution includes a transaction block, appended to the distributed ledger. The reward (e.g., 12.5 BTC in Bitcoin, or $30,000 at present) incentivizes participation.

Finding a valid PoW solution is a probabilistic process, following a Poisson distribution. Miners with modest computational power face high variance. For instance, a desktop CPU would take over a thousand years to mine one Bitcoin block. To reduce variance, miners join mining pools, where a designated pool operator distributes sub-puzzles of lower difficulty. Solutions to these sub-puzzles can yield a full PoW solution. When a miner's solution yields a valid block, the pool operator submits it to the network and distributes the reward among pool members proportionally to their contributions.

### Problem

Centralized pool operators control the substantial computational power of their participants. At the time of writing, Bitcoin and Ethereum derive most of their mining power from a small number of pools. This consolidation raises concerns about security, including the risk of 51% attacks if a single pool operator controls more than half of the network's mining power. Additionally, centralized pools can censor transactions, as seen in recent public speculation about a large Ethereum pool favoring its own transactions during a public crowdsale.

### Solution

We introduce SmartPool, a practical solution for decentralized pooled mining. Our key contributions are:

1. **Decentralization via Smart Contracts:** SmartPool runs as a smart contract on the Ethereum network, leveraging the existing mining infrastructure. This mitigates the need to bootstrap a new mining network.
2. **Efficiency and Scalability:** SmartPool uses a simple yet powerful probabilistic verification technique to ensure fair payoffs. We introduce an augmented Merkle tree for secure and efficient verification. SmartPool allows miners to freely select transaction sets for inclusion in blocks, enhancing censorship resistance.
3. **Low Fees and Low Variance:** Unlike centralized pools, SmartPool does not charge any fees and disburses all block rewards to participants. It offers low-variance payouts similar to centralized pools.

SmartPool can be used for various cryptocurrencies and supports standard payoff schemes like pay-per-share (PPS). We demonstrate its implementation for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and future work will explore other schemes like pay-per-last-n-shares (PPLNS).

### Results

We have implemented and deployed SmartPool on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. As of June 18, 2017, SmartPool-based pools have mined 105 blocks and handled a peak hashrate of 30 GH/s from two substantial miners. Miners incur only 0.6% in operational transaction fees, significantly less than the 3% fees charged by centralized pools like F2Pool. Each miner sends only a few messages per day, and SmartPool maintains low variance payouts.

### Contributions

- **New and Efficient Decentralized Pooled Mining Protocol:** By leveraging smart contracts, a novel data structure, and an efficient verification mechanism, SmartPool provides security and efficiency to miners.
- **Real-World Deployment:** We have implemented and deployed real mining pools on Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, which have mined 105 blocks and handled significant hashrates while incurring minimal transaction fee costs.

## 2. Problem and Challenges

We aim to build a decentralized protocol that allows a large open network to collectively solve a computational PoW puzzle and distribute the earned reward proportional to participants' contributions. The protocol should satisfy the following properties:

- **Decentralization:** No centralized operator manages the protocol. Any participant with sufficient computational power can join and contribute.
- **Efficiency:** Running costs should be low, offering comparable rewards and low variance guarantees as centralized operations. Communication, bandwidth, and local computation costs must be reasonable.
- **Security:** The protocol must protect participants from attackers who might steal rewards or prevent others from joining.
- **Fairness:** Participants receive rewards proportional to their contributions.

### Threat Model and Security Assumptions

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to use pseudonymous identities. There is no inherent identity or PKI in the network. Our solution adheres to this setting. We consider a threat model where miners may act rationally but do not collude to harm the protocol.
