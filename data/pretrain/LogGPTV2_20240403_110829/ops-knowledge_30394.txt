User: I want to kill python interpeter - The intention is that all the python files that are running in this moment will stop (without any informantion about this files).
obviously the processes should be closed.
Any idea as delete files in python or destroy the interpeter is ok :D (I am working with virtual machine).
I need it from the terminal because i write c code and i use linux commands...
Hope for help
Assistant: pgrep -f <your process name> | xargs kill -9
This will kill the your process service.
In my case it is 
pgrep -f python | xargs kill -9
