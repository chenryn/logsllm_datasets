E. Description of Our Attack
Our attack allows the attacker to mitigate the jamming
signal and recover the data signal in the presence of friendly
jamming. The adversary uses a two-antenna array that he
places in the proximity of the transmitting array which
consists of a data source (D) and a jammer (J). As we
derived earlier, for small distances between the two arrays,
the attacker receives the two sets of jamming and data
signals with a non-negligible phase offset δ. This δ allows
the attacker to combine the signals received by A and B
such that the jamming signal component is annihilated and
the data signal recovered.
More precisely, the attacker combines the signals at A
and B to recover a signal ˜y = c exp (−j2πΔc)sd, i.e., a
phase-shifted (by Δc) version of the data signal from D
with different amplitude c. This signal combination can be
described by a vector r, where
˜y = rHx

For the example setting before, choosing rg = [hg

causes the sj component to disappear from ˜y. In other words,

depend on the geometry of the setup, in this case d and
Δt. Note that the difference between the phases of both
terms here is the δ discussed earlier. The closer δ is to
±π (in radians), the higher the amplitude of sd in ˜y. The
achievable δ directly depends on r, which itself depends on
the geometry of the setup.
F. Attack Performance in LOS Setting
We now perform simulations to evaluate the performance
of the attack for different values of d and AB. Due to the
many degrees of freedom for the placement of two antennas
of the attacker with respect to D and J, we restrict this
analysis to a symmetric setting, in which the four antennas
form an isosceles trapezoid. While this setting does not cover
all possible placements of the attacker’s antennas relative to
D and J, it shows how the attack performs with respect
to the distance between A and B, and the general distance
between attacker and D and J.
In the setting used in the simulations (Figure 7), all 4
antennas form an isosceles trapezoid where the TX anten-
nas are 15 cm apart (unless noted otherwise), and the RX
antennas are separated by either 35 cm, 50 cm, or 100 cm.
We now investigate the performance for different distances
d between both antenna arrays. Figure 8 shows the maximal
amplitude of the recovered data signal sd in ˜y, relative to the
amplitude sd would have at A in the absence of J. Therefore,
a relative amplitude of 2 denotes a perfect recovery of the
data signal, in which the data components of both antennas
constructively add together and double the amplitude. It can
be seen that even for a close spacing of the TX antennas,
sd can be recovered from a distance of multiple meters,
depending on RX setup, with some attenuation of less than
20 dB. Because of the different wavelength of bands, such

as the 403 MHz MICS band and the 2.4 GHz ISM band,
the values of δ differ, and therefore the amplitude of the
recovered signal differs as well.
We now estimate the expected bit error rate (BER) at the
attacker to make the impact of our attack more intuitive. For
this, we assume the following: the transmitting and receiving
antennas are in the same formation as before (Figure 7),
with the data and jamming antenna spaced 15 cm apart. We
further assume that the attacker can receive the data signal
with low BER in the absence of the jamming signal, so
we assume his signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to be 16 dB in
the absence of the jamming signal. We now also account
for the receiver noise w we ignored earlier, and assume
that the noise power at both antennas is the same, but the
noise is uncorrelated. Figure 9 shows the impact of the
friendly jamming signal transmitted with 20 dB more than
data signal, for three different conﬁgurations of attacker’s
antennas (antennas placed 35, 50, 100 cm apart). For the case
of AB = 100 cm, we also show results for data and jamming
source 5 cm apart. For reference, we also again also plot
data for the ISM band. We now point
to a number of
observations that can be made from the ﬁgure. First, without
jamming cancellation, the BER at the attacker is 50%, as
expected. This means that if the attacker does not try to
cancel out jamming, he is not able to recover any data
from the transmission. Second, if the attacker’s antennas are
placed 50 cm apart, the attacker can receive the data signal
with a fairly low BER from a distance of up to 1 m from
the transmitter. The BER only reaches 40% at distances of
more than 3 m. Third, increasing the distance between the
antennas of the attacker further improves performance—with
attacker’s antennas placed 1 m apart, the data signal can be
recovered with minimal BER at around 2 meter distance.
Note that even if the attacker exhibits a high BER, he might
learn some information about the transmitted message. Since
the messages are not protected by any form of encryption,
the attacker might be able to recover the full message even
at a high BER.
So far, we have assumed that the attacker can perfectly
align the jamming signal received on both his antennas. We
will validate this assumption in our experiments.
G. Summary of our Simulation Results
Our results show that our attack indeed allows the at-
tacker to recover the data signal in the presence of friendly
jamming. While the range of the attack for the 403 MHz
case is limited to at most a few meters (depending on the
antenna setup of the attacker), the efﬁciency of the attack
increases for higher carrier frequencies such as 2.4 GHz (e.g.
IEEE 802.11) if DJ is kept constant. For these frequencies,
the attacker should be able to mitigate the jamming signal
for distances of up to 10 m with a 1 m spacing between his
antennas.

Figure 11. The attacker uses two antennas (A and B) and an oscilloscope
in order to record the combined data (D) and jamming (J) signals. For
each measurement, the attacker antennas were manually moved around
(but maintaining the distance ‘d’ between AB and DJ) until the data and
jamming signal were reasonably separable during post-processing (details
in Section V-A).
in the case of medical
While these distances might not seem threatening at ﬁrst,
we note that e.g.,
the
communication range of IMD devices is also very limited in
normal operations. Our attack shows that friendly jamming
fails to protect the conﬁdentiality of communication in the
MICS band.
implants,
While we concentrated on a speciﬁc geometric setup in
our evaluation, the attacker is not restricted to the isosceles
trapezoid setting (we discuss this more in Section V-A). In
addition, the attacker can use more than two antennas to
improve his performance.
IV. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
In this section, we experimentally verify the attack de-
scribed in Section III. First, we describe the experimental
setup used to demonstrate the feasibility for an attacker to
successfully demodulate data (within acceptable bit error
rates) in the presence of a friendly jammer. Then we give

while preserving the distance d to D, J and the distance
between the attacker antennas AB. As we will show later,
at some locations we were not able to ﬁnd ideal placements
for the antennas of the attacker.
