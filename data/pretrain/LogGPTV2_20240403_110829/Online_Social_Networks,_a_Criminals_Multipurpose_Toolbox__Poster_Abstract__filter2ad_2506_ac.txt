### 2. Resource Consumption
While updates from sites like Facebook or LinkedIn may not consume a significant amount of data, the provision of bandwidth-intensive video links on these platforms can create challenges for IT directors. Web browsing, especially when high levels of data transfer are required, comes at a cost.

### 3. Viruses and Malware
This threat often goes unnoticed by organizations. Hackers are drawn to social networking sites because they see the potential to commit fraud and launch spam and malware attacks. There are over 50,000 applications available for Facebook, and while the company makes efforts to protect against malware, not all third-party applications are secure. Some have the potential to infect computers with malicious code, which can then be used to collect data from the user's profile. Electronic messaging on social networking sites is also a concern, as the Koobface worm is one example of how messages can be used to spread malicious code and worms.

### 4. Social Engineering
Social engineering is becoming increasingly prevalent, and more people are falling victim to online scams that appear legitimate. This can lead to data breaches or financial fraud. Users may be convinced to provide personal details such as social insurance numbers and employment information. By gathering such information, identity theft becomes a significant risk. Additionally, individuals often post detailed personal information in their social networking profiles. While they might never disclose certain information when meeting someone for the first time, they see no harm in posting it online for everyone to see. This data can be easily mined by cybercriminals.

### 5. Reputation and Legal Liability
At the time of writing, there have been no major corporate lawsuits involving evidence from social networking sites. For example, a young employee wrote on her profile that her job was boring and was soon fired. What if a disgruntled employee decides to complain about a product or the company’s inefficiencies on their profile? There are serious legal consequences if employees use these sites to view objectionable, illegal, or offensive content. An employer might be held liable for failing to protect employees from such material. The legal costs, fines, and damage to the organization’s reputation could be substantial.

### 6. Fake Accounts and Sybil Attacks
It is relatively easy for an attacker to register accounts under someone else's name, despite this being prohibited by the privacy policies of most service providers. This act of creating fake accounts is known as a Sybil attack. An attacker can use personal information, such as photos and videos, on the fake profile to gain the trust of the victim's friends and be accepted into their circle of trust. This way, the attacker gains access to the information shared by the victim's friends, who did not intend to share it with the attacker.

The process of creating fake accounts, known as a "cloning attack," involves the attacker making nearly identical copies of real social network accounts and then adding the same or similar contacts as the victim. Bilge et al. [5] demonstrated the ease of launching automated attacks against popular social networks by sending friend requests to the friends of the cloned victims.

### 7. Crawling
Crawling social media is a relatively new concept. Most social media sites have emerged in the past decade, and companies are interested in using this data for product reviews, brand analysis, and other brand-related insights. However, some social networking sites, like Twitter and Instagram, have complex structures and limitations on the amount of data that can be crawled. This kind of work is better performed using specialized services like Prompt Cloud’s Social Media Data Acquisition Service, which can handle end-to-end requirements and provide the desired data with minimal turnaround time. Most popular social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, allow data extraction only through their own APIs to control the amount of information about their users and their activities.

### 8. Graph Theory
From the early stages, the concept of social networks has been based on graph theory. This method is used to identify the number of nodes and their connections (e.g., influencers and followers). Influencers are users who have a significant impact on the activities or opinions of other users through their followership or influence on decisions made by others in the network. Graph theory is particularly useful for analyzing large-scale datasets. Centrality measures are used to form clusters and assess cohesiveness within social networks. These measures help to evaluate the representation of power and influence that forms clusters and cohesiveness. The authors [34] employed a parameterized centrality metric approach to study the network structure and rank node connectivity, extending the a-centrality approach, which measures the number of shortest paths between nodes.

### VI. Conclusion
Social networking sites have become a prime target for attackers due to the availability of sensitive information and their large user base. Therefore, privacy and security issues in online social networks are increasing. This survey paper addresses various privacy and security concerns, as well as the techniques attackers use to exploit social network security mechanisms or take advantage of flaws in social networking sites. Privacy is a major concern, as many social network users are not careful about what they expose online. Identity theft is another issue, with attackers using social network accounts to steal victims' identities. Spam is also a problem, as attackers use social networks to increase click-through rates, which is more effective than traditional email spam. Malware is another significant issue, as attackers use social networks as a channel to spread malware quickly through the interconnected nature of users. Lastly, physical threats, which are the most harmful, were also addressed.
