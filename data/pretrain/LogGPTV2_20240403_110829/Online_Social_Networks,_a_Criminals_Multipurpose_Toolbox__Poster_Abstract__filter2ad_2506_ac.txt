2.Resources 
        Although  updates  from  sites  like  Facebook  or  LinkedIn 
might not take up immense amounts of information measure, the 
provision  of  (bandwidth-hungry)  video  links  denote  on  these 
sites  creates  issues  for  IT  directors.  there's  a  price  to  web 
browsing,  particularly  once  high  levels  of  information  measure 
area unit needed. 
3.Viruses and Malware 
        This  threat  is  usually  unnoticed  by  organizations.  Hackers 
area unit drawn to social networking sites as a result of they see 
the  potential  to  commit  fraud  and  launch  spam  and  malware 
attacks. There area unit quite fifty,000 applications on the market 
for Facebook (according to the company) and whereas FaceBook 
could  create  each  effort  to  supply  protection  against  malware, 
these  third-party  applications  might  not  all  be  safe.  Some  have 
the  potential  to  be  accustomed  infect  computers  with  malicious

code,  that  successively  may  be  accustomed  collect  knowledge 
from  that  user’s  website.  Electronic  messaging  on  social 
networking  sites  is  additionally  a  priority,  and  therefore  the 
Koobface  worm  is  simply  one  example  of  however  messages 
area unit accustomed unfold malicious code and worms. 
4.Social Engineering 
        Social engineering is changing into a creation and additional 
and  additional  individuals  area  unit  falling  victim  to  on-line 
scams  that  appear  real.  this  will  lead  to  knowledge  or  fraud. 
Users is also convinced to administer personal details like social 
insurance  numbers,  employment  details  and  then  on.  By 
assembling  such  info,  knowledge  larceny  becomes  a  significant 
risk.  On  the  opposite  hand,  individuals  have  a  habit  of  posting 
details  in  their  social  networking  profiles.  whereas  they  might 
ne'er disclose bound info once meeting somebody for the primary 
time,  they  see  nothing  wrong  with  posting  it  on-line  for  all  to 
envision  on  their  profile,  personal  web  log  or  different  social 
networking  website  account.  This  knowledge  will  usually  be 
well-mined by cyber criminals. 
5.Reputation and Legal Liability 
        At  then  time  of  authorship,  there  are  no  major  company 
lawsuits  involving  proof  from  social  networking  sites.  as  an 
example, one young worker wrote on her profile that her job was 
boring  and  shortly  received  her  walking  orders  from  her  boss. 
What if a dissatisfied worker set to complain a couple of product 
or  the  company’s  inefficiencies  in  his  or  her  profile?  There  are 
serious legal consequences if workers use these sites and click on 
on links to look at objectionable, illicit or offensive content. AN 
leader might be command to blame for failing to shield workers 
from  viewing  such  material.  The legal prices,  fines and  harm to 
the organization’s name might be substantial. 
6.Fake Accounts and biological research Attacks 
        Thus,  it's  terribly  simple  for  Associate  in  Nursing  offender 
to  register  accounts  in  the  name  of  somebody  else,  though  it's 
prohibited by the privacy policies of most service suppliers. The 
act of making bogus accounts is additionally referred to as a sybil 
attack. 
        An  offender  will  use  personal  data,  e.g.  photos  and  videos 
of  the  victim,  on  the  faux  profile  to  win  the  trust  of  his  friends 
and  allow  them  to  permit  the  bogus  account  into  their  circle  of 
trust. this fashion the offender can have access to the data of the 
friends  of  his  victim,  that  his  friends  have  united  to  share  with 
the victim and not essentially the offender. 
        The process of making bogus accounts, is named a “cloning 
attack,”  when  the  attacker  clones  (creates  virtually  precise 
copies)  of  real  social  network  accounts  and  then  adds  identical 
and/or alternative contacts as their victim. Bilge et al. [5] showed 
the  ease  of  launching  an  automatic  hoax  attack  against  some  in 
style  social  networks  by  causation  friend  requests  to  friends  of 
many their cloned victims. 
7.Crawling  
        Crawling a social media is fairly a new concept. Most of the 
social media sites are cropped  in the past decade. This is the data 
most  companies  wanted  product  review,  brand  analysis,  and 
overall brand related items. 
        Some of the social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram 
is  not  that  much  easy  task  for  in-house  data  acquisition 
departments  there  structures  are  more  complex  they  have 
limitation  for  crawl  they  amount  of  data.  This  kind  of  work  is 
performed  better  by  using  this  Prompt  Cloud’s  Social  Media 
Data  Acquisition  Service  –  which  can  take  care  of  your  end-to-
end  requirements  and  provide  you  with  the  desired  data  in  a 
minimal turnaround time. Most of the popular social networking 
sites such as Twitter and Facebook let crawlers extract data only 
through  their  own  API    so  as  to  control  the  amount  of 
information about their users and their activities.

8.Graph Theory 
        Earlier stage onwards social network idea  is based on graph 
theory. This method is used to identify the number of nodes and 
there links(for example affluences and the followers).Affluences 
are  called  as  users  they  have  influence  on  the  activities  or 
opinion  of  other  users  by  way  of  followership  or  influence  on 
decision made by other users on the network. 
        Graph theory was very much useful for large scale datasets. 
Centrality  measure is used to forms the clusters  & cohesiveness 
among  [19]  social  network.  It    measure  was  used  to  inspect  the 
representation  of  power  and  influence  that  forms  clusters  and 
cohesiveness  [16]  on  social  network.  Centrality  metric  The 
authors  [34]  employed  parameterized  centrality  metric  approach 
to  study  the  network  structure  and  to  rank  nodes  connectivity. 
Their  work  formed  an  extension  of  a-centrality  approach  which 
measures the number of alleviated paths that exist among nodes. 
VI.  CONCLUSION 
        Social  networking  sites  have  become  a  potential  target  for 
attackers due to the availability of sensitive information, as well 
as  its  large  user  base.  Therefore,  privacy  and  security  issues  in 
online  social  networks  are  increasing.  This  survey  paper 
addressed  different  privacy  and  security  issues,  as  well  as  the 
techniques that attackers use to overcome social network security 
mechanisms,  or  to  take  advantage  of  some  flaws  in  social 
networking site. Privacy issue is one of the main concerns, since 
many social network user are not careful about what they expose 
on their social network space. The second issue is identity theft; 
attackers  make  use  of  social  networks  account  to  steal  victim’s 
identities.  The  third  is  the  spam  issue.  Attackers  make  use  of 
social  networks  to  increase  spam  click  through  rate,  which  is 
more  effective  than  the  traditional  email  spam.  The  forth  is  the 
malware  issue.  Attackers  use  social  networks  as  a  channel  to 
spread  malware,  since 
through 
connectivity  among  users.  Social  networking  sites  are  always 
it  can  spread  very  fast

facing  new  kind  of  malware.  Lastly,  physical  threats,  which  are 
the most harmful issues, were addressed.
