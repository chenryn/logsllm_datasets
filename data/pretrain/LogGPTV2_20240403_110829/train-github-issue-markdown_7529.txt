# Feature request
Add a way to control the versions of babel packages.
## Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
Yes.
I installed `@babel/preset-env` and passed 7.4.4 options (`core: 3`) to it but
it used the old one. It really confused me. (Later I saw in docs it doesn't
work indeed)
A potential problem might also be with plugins like `@babel/plugin-transform-
flow-strip-types` that are not coming out of the box in `next.js`.
They are added with the **latest version** where the babel core is a pinned
down a lower version.
This is a partial code from my `package.json`, I didn't know `@babel/core` is
ignored and nothing warned me it is.
        "@babel/core": "^7.4.4",
        "@babel/preset-env": "^7.4.4",
        "@babel/plugin-transform-flow-strip-types": "^7.4.4",
        "@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining": "^7.2.0",
## Describe the solution you'd like
I think if a user adds `@babel/core` to his root project `package.json` next
should use all babel versions from the user's code, and warn if he doesn't use
all the expected in next.js babel plugins.
We should also consider adding a script to eject all babel dependencies from
next to the user's project. For example: `next eject-babel` (somehow like in
`create-react-app`)
## Describe alternatives you've considered
The readme documents the following:
> The next/babel preset includes everything needed to transpile React
> applications. This includes:
>
>   * preset-env
>   * preset-react
>   * plugin-proposal-class-properties
>   * plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread
>   * plugin-transform-runtime
>   * styled-jsx  
>  These presets / plugins **should not** be added to your custom .babelrc.
> Instead, you can configure them on the next/babel preset:
>
But I think we should also tell the user he should use older versions of babel
plugins and expose the babel version nextjs is using.
Also, we can warn the user that we ignore `@babel/core` and `@babel/preset-
env` if he adds `@babel/core` to the project and runs next.
## Additional context
I'd be glad to add all these features if this feature is accepted.
