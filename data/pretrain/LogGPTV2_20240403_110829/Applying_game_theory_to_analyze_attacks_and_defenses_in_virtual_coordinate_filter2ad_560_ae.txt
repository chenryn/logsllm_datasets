VII. RELATED WORK
Defense Mechanisms in Virtual Coordinate Systems. Re-
search has previously demonstrated the susceptibility of Vi-
valdi
to attacks [20, 21]. To address these vulnerabilities,
there have been several proposed methods to maintain virtual
coordinate system accuracy [1]–[5]. The PIC virtual coordinate
system [1] uses a security test based on the triangle inequality
in which any node that violates the triangle inequality above
some margin of error is ignored and designated as malicious.
However, it has been shown that RTT measurements often
violate this inequality [22]–[24] and thus solutions based
solely on such inequalities may degrade system performance
when no attack is occurring.
Recent work by Kaafar et al.
[2] utilizes a solution
which employs a set of trusted nodes as a reference set by
which to analyze all node behavior for malicious patterns
and behavior. In a similar vein, the reputation-based work
by Saucez et al. [3] uses a priori trusted nodes to detect
malicious nodes. The key difference between these techniques
and methods used in this work is that they do not necessitate
the need for trusted components in the network. Such trusted
components could lead to high deployment costs, for example
[2] requires 10% of nodes to be trusted,
thus potentially
needing hundreds or thousands of trusted nodes. The work by
Sherr et al. [4, 5] uses a veriﬁcation set of nodes for a node n,
where n’s update is considered malicious if a percentage of the
veriﬁcation set perceives the error of the update to be greater
than a predetermined threshold. The main differences between
this technique and the methods we present is that we do not
require extra node sets nor network communication which may

over multiple metrics.
Game Theoretic Security Approaches. Game theory has
been a mainstream research topic in the economic community
since the landmark Ph.D.
thesis of J. Nash [15] and the
interested reader is referred to the work by Binmore [25] for
a comprehensive introduction to the area. One of the ﬁrst
approaches for applying game theory to network security is
described by McInerney et al. [26]. In this work, an underlying
Markovian decision process and a simple one-player game
are used to reason, detect, and respond to automated attack
behavior in information assurance systems. Similar work on
network security by Lye and Wing [27] models the interaction
between an attacker and a defender as a two-player stochastic
game. The explicit enumeration of states as described in the
previous papers two is impossible in our context due to the
large number of attacking nodes that we consider.
Applied economics concepts have also been applied to com-
puter security to address the analysis of strategic choices that
enterprises will take regarding maintenance and management
under an assumed cost model [28]. For example, some of
our previous work has used game theory to understand and
better defend against blocking and ﬂooding attacks against
distributed hash tables used in P2P Session Initiation Protocol
infrastructures [29]. However, the previous model cannot cap-
ture the varying degrees of irrationality inherent in the current
environment and we incorporate the regular quantal response
equilibrium [16] to accurately model the malicious behavior.
VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we have deﬁned and used an analytical frame-
work in order to analyze strategic choices and identify the best
attack strategies and corresponding defense strategies used in
virtual coordinate systems. We have performed experiments
using two Internet topology data sets that have correspondingly
different sizes and characteristics. Our results demonstrate that
spatial-temporal and spatial outlier detection perform the best
while temporal outlier detection is ineffective in isolation.
However, temporal outlier detection is often part of the defense
proﬁle in combination with the other two techniques. From
an attackers perspective, the best attack strategy to use is the
inﬂation attack with varying percentages of malicious nodes,
depending on the deployed defense technique. We have also
assessed several threshold settings for the outlier detection and
the spatial outlier threshold of 1.25 provides the best results
for a ﬁx threshold. We also introduced an adaptive threshold
selection that was more effective than a ﬁxed threshold, and
found the best parameters to use are the 75th percentile
prediction error and a constant c of 0.08. Future work consists
of extending these methods towards more complex games in
which learning and signaling occur during system operation.
For instance, benign nodes might
learn defense strategies
online while attackers perform sequences of simple strategies.
