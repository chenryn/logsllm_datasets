### Analysis of Video Delivery Quality and Potential Issues

#### Key Observations
- **Video Startup Delays:**
  - 23% of views experience a delay of more than 5 seconds before the video starts.
  - 14% of views wait more than 10 seconds.
  - 9% of views wait at least 20 seconds before losing patience.

- **Bitrate Issues:**
  - 28% of views have an average bitrate less than 500 Kbps.
  - 74.1% of views have an average bitrate less than 1 Mbps.

- **Error Rates:**
  - 2.84% of views fail to start due to fatal errors.
  - 14.43% of views do not start but without errors (not shown).

#### Implications
Previous studies indicate that a 1% increase in rebuffering ratio can reduce the total play time by more than 3 minutes. Viewers with low join times (those who have started playing the video) are particularly affected. 

Next, we identify and analyze three potential issues that could result in poor video quality:

### Client-Side Variability
- **Bandwidth Estimation:**
  - Figure 2 shows the distribution of the standard deviation of the client-side intra- and inter-session estimated bandwidth, highlighting significant variability in client-side conditions.
  - Intra-session bandwidth: We compute the standard deviation of all bandwidth samples across the entire view duration, excluding views with only one sample.
  - Inter-session bandwidth: For each viewer, we compute the average bandwidth of each session and then the standard deviation across different sessions initiated by that viewer.
  - The results show that for views with bandwidth less than 1 Mbps, more than 20% have an intra-session deviation of 400 Kbps. For views with bandwidth between 4-5 Mbps, the deviation is 2 Mbps.
  - Inter-session variability is also significant, with more than 20% of viewers with bandwidth less than 1 Mbps having a deviation of 250 Kbps.

- **Implications:**
  - Given today's bitrate levels (e.g., 400, 800, 1000, 3000 Kbps), there is a need for intelligent bitrate selection and switching to ensure a smooth viewing experience.
  - It is necessary to choose a suitable bitrate at the start of each session to account for inter-session variability and dynamically adapt the bitrate midstream to account for intra-session variability.

### CDN Variability Across Space and Time
- **Performance Variation:**
  - The performance of CDN infrastructure for delivering video can vary significantly both spatially (across ISPs or geographical regions) and temporally.
  - Such variation can be caused by load, misconfiguration, or other network conditions.
  - Figure 3 shows the average rebuffering ratio, video startup time, and video start failure rate experienced by clients with three major CDNs across different geographical regions during peak hours.
  - For example, in City1, the rebuffering ratio of CDN1 is almost twice that of users with CDN2.
  - No single CDN is optimal across all cities for any given metric. For instance, CDN1 is optimal for City4 and City6, CDN2 for City1 and City5, and CDN3 for City2 and City3.
  - CDNs may differ in their performance across metrics. For example, CDN3 performs the best in video startup time in all cases except City4, but it has the worst failure rate.

- **Temporal Variability:**
  - Figure 4 shows the same metrics for one of these top cities over three days, indicating that no CDN has the best performance all the time.
  - The rebuffering ratio and failure rate of a CDN can fluctuate significantly over time. For example, CDN3 has the lowest rebuffering ratio for half the time and the highest for the other half.
  - Most performance degradation is not correlated across CDNs, suggesting that variations are not merely due to time-of-day effects but other factors.

- **Load Impact:**
  - Figure 5(a) shows the rebuffering ratio vs. normalized CDN load for one CDN in one city over a week, indicating that the rebuffering ratio generally increases with the normalized load.
  - This highlights the need for providers to have multiple CDNs to optimize delivery across different geographical regions and over time. Dynamically choosing a CDN can potentially improve overall video quality.

### ISP and AS Under Stress
- **ISP Congestion:**
  - Figure 5(b) shows the rebuffering ratio of one AS from all three CDNs during a 4-hour flash crowd period, indicating that the rebuffering ratio becomes quite high when the number of views increases.
  - Heavy load can lead to ISP congestion, and ideally, the video delivery infrastructure should be aware of these network hotspots to optimize video quality.
  - During overload scenarios, content providers may need to enforce a global policy, such as reducing the bitrate for all views or providing higher quality only to premium customers.

### Summary of Key Observations
- A significant fraction of sessions suffer quality issues, with more than 20% of sessions experiencing 10% rebuffering and more than 14% of sessions with 10 seconds of startup delay.
- There is significant variability in client-side bandwidth both within and across sessions, suggesting the need for intelligent bitrate adaptation.
- CDN quality varies considerably both across time and space, indicating the need for providers to dynamically choose different CDNs for different clients.
- When streaming demand exceeds the capacity of CDNs or ISPs, content providers may need to enforce a global policy across clients to ensure a good viewing experience.

### Framework for Optimizing Video Delivery
The previous section highlighted that many video sessions today observe serious quality issues due to client-side variability, spatio-temporal variability in CDN performance, and occasional overload. The natural question is how to design an optimized video delivery mechanism that is robust to such conditions.

#### Design Space
The design space for optimizing video delivery quality has three main dimensions:
1. **Parameters to Control:**
   - Choice of bitrate and choice of CDN/server to serve the content.
   - Because the specific video server is controlled by the CDN, we only consider server selection at a CDN granularity.

2. **Timing of Parameter Selection:**
   - Parameters can be selected at startup time when the video player is launched or dynamically adapted midstream in response to changing network conditions.

3. **Decision-Maker:**
   - Three options: purely client-side mechanisms, server-driven mechanisms, and an alternative control plane that selects parameters based on global state.

#### Example Points in the Design Space
- **Static Selection:**
  - Both CDN and bitrate are selected by the client at startup. This approach is not robust to changes in CDN performance and client access bandwidth.

- **Client-Side Bitrate Adaptation:**
  - Client-side bitrate adaptation with the CDN fixed at startup. This is the de-facto approach today, offering advantages in observing local network effects and quick response times.

- **Control Plane:**
  - A control plane deployed by a content provider or a third party can dynamically adapt both the CDN and bitrate midstream based on global knowledge of network, distribution of active clients, and CDN performance.
  - This control plane offers more flexibility in implementing fine-grained policies, such as providing higher quality service to premium customers under load.

#### Global Optimization
- **Resource Allocation:**
  - At a high level, this is a resource allocation problem where the resources are the CDNs. Each CDN has a certain capacity and performance characteristics, and the goal is to allocate these resources optimally to maximize overall video quality.

By addressing these dimensions, we can design a more robust and adaptive video delivery system that ensures a better viewing experience for all users.
