Symfony version | 3.4.7  
Hello,
Updating one of our project from Sf 3.4.4 to 3.4.7 i see an error at
cache:clear command or any other cli command from the console.
    ./app/console cache:clear --no-warmup --env=local (same for dev)
    In Container.php line 297:
      Circular reference detected for service "routing.loader", path: "routing.loader".
Try to check our routing import but did not found any duplicate... anyway it
is only appearing when updating to 3.4.7 .
Did something changed related to this subject? do we need to take care of
something in special in our configs?
Thx
