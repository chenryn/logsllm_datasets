Hello,

While updating one of our projects from Symfony 3.4.4 to 3.4.7, I encountered an error when running the `cache:clear` command or any other CLI command from the console.

#### Command:
```bash
./app/console cache:clear --no-warmup --env=local
```
The same issue occurs for the `dev` environment.

#### Error:
```
In Container.php line 297:
  Circular reference detected for service "routing.loader", path: "routing.loader".
```

I have checked our routing imports and did not find any duplicates. This issue only appears after updating to Symfony 3.4.7.

**Questions:**
- Has there been any change related to this in the recent update?
- Are there any specific configurations or adjustments we need to make to resolve this issue?

Thank you for your assistance.
