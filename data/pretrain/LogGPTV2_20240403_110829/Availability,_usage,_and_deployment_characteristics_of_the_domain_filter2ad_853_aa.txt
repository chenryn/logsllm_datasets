## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical component of the Internet's infrastructure and is one of the few robust, highly-scalable, and operational distributed systems. Although some studies have characterized its properties, such as workload and stability of top-level servers, many key components of DNS remain unexamined. Based on large-scale measurements from servers in a content distribution network, we present a detailed study of key characteristics of the DNS infrastructure, including load distribution, availability, and deployment patterns of DNS servers. Our analysis covers both local DNS servers and servers in the authoritative hierarchy. We find that (1) the vast majority of users rely on a small fraction of deployed name servers, (2) most name servers exhibit high availability, and (3) there is greater diversity in the deployment and usage of local DNS servers compared to authoritative servers. Additionally, we use our DNS measurements to draw conclusions about federated infrastructures in general, evaluating and discussing the impact of federated deployment models on future systems, such as Distributed Hash Tables.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a crucial part of the Internet's infrastructure and has grown to be one of the largest distributed systems. Despite its complexity and importance, in-depth studies of its characteristics have only recently been conducted. This paper presents a large-scale measurement study of the DNS infrastructure, focusing on key characteristics such as availability, load distribution, and deployment patterns of DNS servers. Understanding these properties is essential not only for DNS but also for the study of federated infrastructures, which are managed independently by multiple organizations. Our results indicate that a large fraction of end-users rely on a small number of local DNS servers, and the majority of both local and authoritative DNS servers are highly available. We also observe a higher degree of diversity in the deployment and usage of local DNS servers compared to authoritative servers.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 DNS Infrastructure
The Domain Name System is a distributed database responsible for translating names to addresses of network locations, and it is a critical component of almost all network applications. The DNS infrastructure consists of various components, including root and top-level domain (TLD) servers, authoritative DNS (ADNS) servers, and local DNS (LDNS) servers. LDNS servers are typically deployed within an organization to serve its user population, while ADNS servers are deployed by publishers to advertise services or locations. We seek to understand three particular attributes of the DNS infrastructure: load distribution, availability, and deployment styles.

### 2.2 Infrastructure Characteristics
1. **Load Distribution:** The load on each nameserver, defined as the number of queries it receives, indicates the number of users accessing it.
2. **Availability:** The availability of a server is the fraction of time it is online and reachable. Both conditions are necessary for the service to be available.
3. **Deployment Styles:** We are interested in how organizations deploy sets of nameservers, such as whether they partition their users equally among several local name servers or if there is more diversity in the load among different nameservers within the same organization.

## 3. Measurement Setup
To infer the characteristics of interest, we collected and correlated several data sets concerning DNS servers. We examined DNS access logs from Akamai, a large content distribution network (CDN), and HTTP request logs from a set of Web caches over a period of a week. We also performed active probes to a large number of servers over a two-week period to infer availability. Finally, we studied deployment patterns by examining the relative load characteristics of servers within the same organization.

### 3.1 Sample Sets and Load Estimation
#### 3.1.1 LDNS Servers
We obtained a sample of LDNS servers through the collection of DNS logs from Akamai’s “low-level” servers. These logs contain the time of access, the IP of the requester, and the name and type of the DNS record accessed. We used this data to estimate the relative load on LDNS servers based on the number of requests they made to Akamai during a one-week period.

#### 3.1.2 ADNS Servers
We observed ADNS servers during a “reverse-crawl” of the .in-addr.arpa authoritative hierarchy and collected data from several Web caches to estimate the relative load on ADNS servers based on the number of requests made to websites they are authoritative for.

### 3.2 Availability Probes
We performed exponentially spaced DNS and ICMP ping probes to each server in our sample sets to measure their availability over a two-week period. We took steps to filter and reduce the data to eliminate outliers and observed anomalies.

## 4. Measurement Results and Analysis
Our results show that a large fraction of end-users rely on a small number of local DNS servers. The majority of both local and authoritative DNS servers exhibit high availability, with a slight positive correlation between usage and availability. We also observe a higher degree of diversity in the deployment and usage of local DNS servers, with many behind dynamic IP addresses and some with diurnal availability patterns. Local DNS server deployments within organizations range from a few highly used servers to a large number of lightly loaded ones, suggesting different levels of partitioning of administrative domains.

## 5. Evaluation of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
To demonstrate the utility of our measurements, we present an evaluation of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) with DNS-like availability characteristics. This evaluation provides insights into the potential performance and reliability of future federated systems.

## 6. Related Work
We review previous and related work on DNS and federated infrastructures, highlighting the contributions and limitations of existing studies.

## 7. Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the DNS infrastructure, including its load distribution, availability, and deployment patterns. These findings are valuable for the design and management of future federated systems, such as Distributed Hash Tables, and offer insights into the challenges and opportunities of decentralized infrastructure deployment.
