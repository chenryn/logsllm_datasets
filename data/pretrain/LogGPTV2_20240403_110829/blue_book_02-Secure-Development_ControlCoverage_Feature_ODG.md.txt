### ODG Description and Rationale

| Control | Severity | Automated Fix Script | Description and Rationale |
|---------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **ODG must be installed on a hardened, locked-down VM** | High | No | The ODG machine serves as a gateway into the corporate environment, allowing cloud endpoints to access enterprise data. Using a locked-down, secure baseline configuration ensures that this machine is not exploited as an entry point to downstream data servers or services. |
| **Additional logging in diagnostics should be disabled** | Low | No | The additional logs feature of the ODG tool contains all records and data that pass through the ODG. These logs may include customers' PII and other sensitive information. Disabling this feature helps protect sensitive data. |
| **Privacy level setting must be configured to "Private" while using ODG in PowerBI** | High | No | Granting minimum permissions ensures that users are given just enough access to perform their tasks. This minimizes the exposure of resources in case of a user or service account compromise. Configuring the privacy level to "Private" in PowerBI is essential for maintaining data confidentiality. |
| **Must use the least required permission based on the scenario while sharing gateways through PowerApps/Flow** | High | No | Granting minimum permissions ensures that users are given just enough access to perform their tasks. This minimizes the exposure of resources in case of a user or service account compromise. When sharing gateways through PowerApps/Flow, it is crucial to apply the principle of least privilege. |
| **Failover plan should be designed as per business requirements** | Medium | No | The ODG service does not provide built-in features for backup and disaster recovery. Therefore, when processing critical workloads, it is essential to have adequate backups of the data. A well-designed failover plan is necessary to ensure business continuity. |
| **User accounts/roles connecting to the data source must have minimum required permissions** | Medium | No | Granting minimum access ensures that users are given just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes the exposure of resources in case of a user or service account compromise. It is important to ensure that user accounts and roles connecting to the data source have the least required permissions. |

This table provides a clear and structured overview of the controls, their severity, whether an automated fix script is available, and the rationale behind each control.
