User: I'm very new to Python development, and am having a problem with one of my apps in OSX.
Technologies being used in this project

python 2.6
django
google app engine
rpx (openid)

When loading up the site on my windows app, there are no issues, but when trying to same app on OSX 10.6, I get the following issue:

ImportError at /rpx/rpx/login/
No module named _ctypes
Here's where the error is happening:
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/lib/python2.6/ctypes/init.py  in 

#

"""create and manipulate C data types in Python"""
import os as _os, sys as _sys
version = "1.1.0"
from _ctypes import Union, Structure, Array 

Any ideas? Thanks!

The accepted answer is correct in that all you need to do is set the Python Path in the GAE preferences to /usr/bin/python2.5.
There is no need to download python 2.5 via macports or from the official python website.
python 2.5 is still installed in OSX 10.6, it is just not the default python interpreter. For this reason you need to tell GAE explicitly to use version 2.5.
FWIW I'm using GAE Launcher 1.4.1
