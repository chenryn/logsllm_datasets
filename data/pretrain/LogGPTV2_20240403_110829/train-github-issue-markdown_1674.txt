### Description
The reflectable package does not work with flutter v0.6.0, while it does work
with v0.5.1.
### Minimal Example
Given the following minimal example:
https://github.com/s-bauer/flutter_reflectable_minimal
### Working with v0.5.1
With v0.5.1 it works like expected. I execute the `tools/builder.dart` script
using the following command  
`flutter packages pub run tools/builder.dart lib/main.dart`
It produces the expected `main.reflectable.dart` output producing the
following OUTPUT
### Failing with v0.6.0+
With version v0.6.0 I execute the same command, but this time it fails with
the following OUTPUT.  
I tested it with version v0.6.0 and 0.6.2-pre.15, maybe the bug even occurred
in earlier versions of flutter. I haven't checked that!
I have no idea how to further investigate this issue. Can you please look into
it and find out what is going wrong here?
