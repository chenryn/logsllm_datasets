of four participants seemed to indicate that they understood
that their PINs were weak and could be easily guessed.
“Didn’t ask how he [the perpetrator] got to know but I guess
he watched me type it or he may have guessed it since it
was simple enough.” (P25)
Participants’ comments show that they relied on other
measures to complement security o(cid:29)ered by PINs. These
approaches include risk aversion of attackers against at-
tacking (cid:27)nancial and physical assets (discussed earlier),
aversion of attackers to be recorded in the act, and partici-
pants being careful of their assets around attackers:
“For the gym locker PIN, I am worried sometimes because
many people are around and I leave my wallet and phone
in the bag when going for shower. But there are cameras in
some areas so I think people would not try something silly.”
(P33)
Two participants complained about the PIN entry in-
terface for Net(cid:30)ix Parental lock. These participants com-
plained that on big screens, the Net(cid:30)ix parental lock did
not provide them with a way to enter the PIN without giv-
ing it away in shared spaces—particularly with the children
in the vicinity.
“[...] when my kids ask me to play speci(cid:27)c content I’ve to
ask them to leave the room.” (P24)
The relative ease with which PINs can be shoulder surfed
is known [28]. Our study shows users are aware of this
issue, and that it negatively a(cid:29)ects trust in PINs as an ef-
fective security control. We discuss some remediation in
Section 6.
5.3 Memorability Issues
As noted, participants rated memorability as the most im-
portant criteria for selecting PINs. This high ranking may
be attributed to avoiding potential inconveniences:
“You have to be really quick in restaurants or stores, you
can’t be guessing and trying to remember it. That’s why I
keep the same PIN.” (P32)
Memorability and ease of entering a known PIN seemed
to trump security even for the cases where participants de-
cided to update PINs. Three participants reported that they
reluctantly reverted their PINs because of frequent errors.
“Did change after [my girlfriend learned it] because we
were living in the same shared space but made so many
mistakes that I reverted; entry mistakes from muscle
memory” (P27)
Stobert and Biddle [44] found that users found coping
mechanisms to live with the di(cid:28)culties of password au-
thentication. Similarly, PIN users seem to be using strate-
gies to deal with the memorability-related challenges of PIN
authentication by compromising security. In Section 6, we
discuss some approaches to mitigate these memorability-
related challenges.
5.4 PINs and Past Relationships
Park et al. [37] conducted an online survey and found that,
among other factors, marriage and co-habitation results in
the sharing of online accounts. Our (cid:27)ndings are congru-
ent with theirs. Our participants self-reported wide-spread
sharing of PINs with their romantic partners.
Nine participants reported sharing their digital PINs with
someone that they were in a romantic relationship with in
the past. Three of these participants did not change the
PIN because they either still trusted that person or they felt
there was no need since the other person no longer had ac-
cess to assets (“[I] changed it just for more privacy but didn’t
feel the need to change it.” (P6)). Other participants updated
their PINs, although one participant reported that there was
no need to do so (“[Did] nothing as I had the device” (P3)).
One participant reported changing PIN because the other
person still cohabited with them.
For (cid:27)nancial assets, (cid:27)ve participants reported sharing it
with people that they were in a relationship in the past,
and only two people reported updating it. Note that these
participants also reported updating their digital PINs after
moving on. Only four participants shared their physical
PINs with past relationships, and only one reported updat-
ing it. While these PINs were for home or garage access,
participants reported not changing those because they still
trusted their past partner (Nothing was done as there was
never a problem. (P13)).
Park et al. [37] identi(cid:27)ed that individuals are likely to
attempt to remove or disable a partner’s access to online
accounts. We did not (cid:27)nd this to be the case for our par-
ticipants. Unlike with online accounts, participants would
need access to assets in addition to the authentication
secret (i.e., PINs). However, with the increasing number
of online services that accept PINs and the widespread
reuse, this may pose a threat to those accounts where PIN
has been reused. For such cases, it would be bene(cid:27)cial
to consider the guidelines suggested by Obada-Obieh et
10
al. [36] on design improvements of online accounts to
support users better when they end account sharing.
5.5 Physical PIN Inheritance and Update
One interesting (cid:27)nding was the “inheritance” of physical
PINs that protected garage doors. Nine participants
reported moving to another house with a pre-existing PIN
set to open the garage door, but only three participants
reported updating that PIN while the remaining six kept
the PIN set by the previous owner. One participant even
reported reusing the inherited PIN for their home lock:
“Garage [PIN was set] by previous owner. [I] used it again
for home lock that was installed afterwards” (P27)
Since four of these six participants reported changing the
home locks, the lack of the update of garage door PINs can-
not be attributed to trust. Instead, this insecure behaviour
is due to the lack of knowledge on how to update the PIN:
“No, the garage was setup by previous owner. We did
change the key locks and considered updating the garage
PIN but there is no information available on it on how to
do that.” (P34)
This inability to update garage door PIN was also voiced by
participants when these PINs were accidentally divulged:
“Once a person who was delivering a package [saw it]. My
husband was concerned about it but neither knew how to
change it.” (P35)
While the instructions on how to update these PINs were
missing, two participants did comment that laziness on
their part also contributed to the situation, and that they
had other resources available.
“[It was shared with the] Garage door repair person when
they were here to (cid:27)x the door. Didn’t change it... don’t
know how to although I can google [search].” (P26)
One participant complained that the previous owner did
not share the Master PIN that would allow a PIN update,
thereby eliminating their ability to update it. The inability
of users to e(cid:29)ortlessly update PIN in case of a compromise
could potentially result in security issues. In Section 6, we
discuss possible remediation strategies.
6 Future Research Directions
PIN choices and management strategies. Our partic-
ipants reported widely sharing and reusing PINs, and in-
frequently changing them even after they were compro-
mised. The interviews indicate that the main driving fac-
tor behind this risky behaviour was the memorability of
PINs. Most participants did not adopt a PIN management
strategy by explicitly considering the threat actors. When
prompted to choose a PIN, they chose a PIN that they re-
membered well. Only a few participants considered aspects
such as the circles they had to share the PIN with before
choosing their PINs. Other factors that need to be con-
sidered include the nature of the asset, the susceptibility
of attacks on the asset (e.g., shoulder sur(cid:27)ng is more of a
threat for a smartphone than an ATM PIN), and the type
of recourse that is available to participants in the event of a
compromise. While these are important considerations, ad-
ditional research needs to be conducted to understand that
a user with an average technology and security pro(cid:27)ciency
is able to make secure PIN choices given these factors. This
will enable researchers to create improvements that actu-
ally match user expectations in their everyday lives.
PIN-based authentication is used for six assets on aver-
age and recalling the correct PIN for the right asset is prob-
lematic for several participants. Existing proposals on the
memorability of PINs (discussed in Section 2) do not im-
prove the situation with multiple assets and multiple PINs.
A cued recall-based approach that allows a participant to
associate pairs of assets and PINs (or corresponding word
representation of PINs) may o(cid:29)er mitigation. Digital wal-
lets, for example, enable users to perform secure transac-
tions without entering PINs, but such features are not avail-
able for all PINs, particularly physical PINs. Digital apps for
smartphones could be designed to help people with such re-
call issues with features similar to that of a password man-
ager but would enable quick recall for digital, (cid:27)nancial, and
physical PINs.
Con(cid:27)dence in PINs as a security control. Prior empir-
ical studies report on the susceptibility of PINs to shoulder
sur(cid:27)ng attacks and users’ experiences of such attacks [4, 18,
22, 28]. We also uncovered the limited levels of faith users
reported on PINs’ resistance to shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks (see
Section 4.6). While simple defences like shielding the key-
pad while entering a PIN is e(cid:29)ective, it is not widely used
as it shows the lack of trust to the observers.
Improved
PIN entry interfaces have been proposed that provide de-
fences against shoulder sur(cid:27)ng (discussed in Section 2), but
the limited availability of these on smartphones may reduce
the e(cid:28)cacy of PINs as an e(cid:29)ective security control. We also
noted several cases where participants had to inadvertently
share their PINs or enter PINs in front of other people. The
availability of a short-term device access approach like Sna-
pApp [9] may help users greatly improve the security pos-
ture of their digital PINs.
Improved interfaces for PIN update. PIN-based au-
thentication on devices with limited interfaces (e.g., garage
doors and digital home locks) introduces unique challenges.
Our study shows that users are more likely to continue in-
herited PINs for such assets due to the lack of clear and
readily available instructions on how to update PINs. Fur-
thermore, such assets may require a master PIN to update or
reset PINs, and the storage and management of such a PIN
further complicates the situation. One participant reported
11
sharing the same PIN with people of di(cid:29)erent trust levels
with (e.g., family vs. pet caretaker) despite the availability
of the digital home lock to create di(cid:29)erent PINs. This was
primarily due to the inability of the device to report which
PINs were used when.
As the security of an asset is dependent on being able to
change the PIN in case of a compromise, there is a need to
design a standard way to update and reset PINs on devices
with limited interfaces (i.e., only keypad). Alternatively, in-
structions could be provided on the physical locks to reduce
barriers to PIN update on such devices. While the availabil-
ity of such unifying methods for updating PINs on future
devices would make a di(cid:29)erence in encouraging PIN up-
dates after compromise, the challenge will remain for mil-
lions of devices currently in use. One possible approach
is to design augmented reality tools to address this gap by
linking these physical assists to known documentation and
instructions for updating PINs.
7 Limitations
Our study has some inherent limitations similar to that of
other user studies, which include that many of the (cid:27)ndings
are based on self-reported data from willing participants.
Prior empirical studies of PIN usage on smartphones [22]
indicated that participants under-report their daily PIN us-
age, which may also be the same here. In which case, our
results may underestimate the total number of PINs used
across asset types, which is compounded by the fact that
some categories, such as banking app PINs, could be classi-
(cid:27)ed as both digital and (cid:27)nancial. In an attempt to mitigate
this limitation, we choose to use a semi-structured inter-
view method that included suggestions of assets, to help
ensure that participants thought of the diversity of assets
where PINs are used.
Additionally, we asked several contextual questions for
the most widely used PIN in each category. As a result, our
study is limited in scope with regard to the most widely
used PINs, but we were able to collect quality responses
from participants in a time-constrained lab-based study re-
garding the PINs that protect the most assets.
We were also limited geographically in our participant
pool, which belonged to the Waterloo and Guelph regions
in Canada. This is a relatively safe place to work and live
(as self-reported by the participants). The safe environ-
ment may have implicitly encouraged some of the unsafe
practices among our participants for PINs protecting their
physical assets. However, we do believe this convenience
sample does generalize to many other populations, but not
all, and more research would be needed to understand how
di(cid:29)erent populations approach PIN security.
Finally, interviews were conducted by two researchers
sequentially, where both researchers used the same semi-
structured script of questions. We found that the second
researcher elicited more detailed quotes from participants,
which are cited more throughout the document; however,
data collected by the (cid:27)rst researcher are still ecologically
valid and were fully used in data analysis.
8 Conclusion
We conducted a study with 35 participants to understand
how they manage PINs across di(cid:29)erent assets. Our (cid:27)ndings
show behaviour that may result in potential compromises
due to widespread sharing and reuse of PINs across di(cid:29)er-
ent asset categories were mainly motivated by reasons of
memorability. The memorability concerns also deter users
from updating PINs after they are compromised. Partici-
pants further reported their lack of con(cid:27)dence in PINs due
to their susceptibility to shoulder sur(cid:27)ng attacks—a con-
cern that can be mitigated using PIN entry interfaces that
resist shoulder sur(cid:27)ng. Our study also shows that partici-
pants change their PIN management behaviour for di(cid:29)erent
types of assets due to the availability of another recourse in
case of a compromise. Finally, we propose further research
directions for researchers. With the increasing options to
use PINs for purposes of authentication for di(cid:29)erent types
of assets, our (cid:27)ndings will help researchers design tools and
strategies to improve the security of PIN-protected assets.
