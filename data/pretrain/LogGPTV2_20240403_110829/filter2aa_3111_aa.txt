--[ 1. Introduction
The exploitation of Electromagnetic Emanations and similar Side Channels has 
always been one of the most interesting and "exotic" areas of attack in the 
security field.
In the late 60's and early 70's the term TEMPEST[1] was coined to title an 
NSA operation which aimed to secure electronic equipment from leakage of 
compromising emanations. Well known TEMPEST research describes remote 
eavesdropping of CRT displays and most recently LCD displays, as well as 
optical emanations from appliances LED indicators.
Our research details two attacks, one against wired PS/2 keyboards, the 
other against laptop keyboards using respectively power line leakage and 
optical sampling of mechanical energy.
We describe how using relatively cheap homemade hardware we can implement 
basic but powerful techniques for remotely eavesdropping keystrokes.
--[ 2. Motivation
The two presented attacks partially builds upon existing concepts and 
techniques, but while some of the ideas might have been publicly hinted, no 
clear analysis and demonstration has ever been presented as far as we know.
Our goal is to show that information leaks in the most unexpected ways and 
can be indeed retrieved. If our small research was able to accomplish 
acceptable results in a brief development time (approximately a week of 
work) and with cheap hardware, consider what a dedicated team or government 
agency can accomplish with more expensive equipment and effort.
We think it is important to raise the awareness about these unconventional 
attacks and we hope to see more work on this topic in the future[2].
Last but not least.....hardware hacking is cool and everyone loves laser 
beams (this will make sense).
--[ 3. First Attack - Theory
The PS/2 cable of wired keyboards and mice carries the following wires:
                                  ---- 
- Pin 1: Data                   / 6||5 \
- Pin 3: Ground                | 4 || 3 |
- Pin 4: +5 V DC                \ 2  1 /
- Pin 5: Clock                    ----
- Pin 2/6: Unused
As the wires are very close and not shielded against each other it is 
theorized that a fortuitous leakage of information goes from the data wire 
to the ground wire and/or cable shielding due to electromagnetic coupling.
The ground wire as well as the cable shielding are routed to the main power 
adapter/cable ground which is then connected to the power socket and finally 
the electric grid.
This eventually leads to keystrokes leakage to the electric grid which can 
then be detected on the power plug itself, including nearby ones sharing the 
same electric line.
There might be other factors responsible in minor part for the signal 
interference like power fluctuations of the keyboard microcontroller, they 
are difficult to pinpoint but if present they can only augment the 
information leakage.
The clock frequency of the PS/2 signal is lower than any other component or 
signal emanated from the PC (everything else is typically above the MHz), 
this allows noise filtering and keystrokes signal extraction.
There has been some documentation suggesting the possibility of this attack 
in literature, though no extensive research is available. Recently a 
separate independent research which was developed simultaneously to our 
effort also suggests that "...the shared ground may acts as an antenna..." 
[3].
--[ 4. First Attack - The PS/2 Signal
The PS/2 signal represents an appealing and relatively favourable target for 
eavesdropping. The main advantage is its serial nature as data is 
transmitted one bit at a time, each keystroke is sent in a frame consisting 
of 11-12 bits (host-to-device).
As mentioned the clock frequency falls in the VLF (Very Low Frequency) 
category pulsing at 10 - 16.7 kHz range.
This is an example of what a PS/2 frame looks like:
   ------------- ------------- -------------- ------------ -----------   
  |Start (1 bit)|Data (8 bits)|Parity (1 bit)|Stop (1 bit)|Ack (1 bit)|
   ------------- ------------- -------------- ------------ -----------
The acknowledge bit is used for host-to-device communication only.
As an example the letter 'b' (scan code 32) is the following frame:
   --- ---------- --- ---
  | 0 | 01001100 | 0 | 1 |
   --- ---------- --- ---
--[ 5. First Attack - Implementation
In order to implement the attack the ground from a nearby power socket is 
routed to the ADC using a modified power cable (remember the disclaimer) 
which separates the ground wire for probing and includes a resistor between 
the two probe hooks. The current dispersed on the ground is measured using 
the voltage potential difference between the two ends of the resistor.
With "nearby" power socket we identify anything connected to the same 
electric system within a reasonable range, distances are discussed in the 
results paragraph.
In order to accomplish the measurement a "reference" ground is needed, as 
any ADC would need a proper ground for its own operation but at the same 
time the electrical grid ground is the target of our measurements. Because 
of this the main ground cannot be used as the equipment ground, as that 
would lead to null potential difference at the two ends of the probe.
A "reference" ground is any piece of metal with a direct physical connection 
to the Earth, a sink or toilet pipe is perfect for this purpose (while 
albeit not very classy) and easily reachable (especially if you are 
performing the attack from an hotel room).

--[ 6. First Attack - Data Analysis
The sniffed signal using the circuit described in the previous diagram 
provides a consistent amount of data which requires analysis for extracting 
the desired signal.
In order to isolate the desired frequency range we use a simple band pass 
filter selecting frequencies between 1 - 20 kHz. A Finite Impulse Response 
(FIR) filter is just one of the many possible filtering techniques, while 
it's not indicated as the most efficient method it provided good results in 
our tests.
The following is an example of FIR filter implementation using the Open 
Source software Scilab:
[h,filter_mag,fr] = wfir('bp',order,[.001,.02],'hm',[0,0]);
In this example the window ([.001,.02]) is the frequency range (1 - 20 kHz) 
expressed in normalized hertz, considering a frequency sampling of 1 Msps. 
The 'hm' parameters means that we are using an hamming windowing technique 
which reduces anti-aliasing effects in the two edges of the window.
--[ 7. First Attack - Results
The test runs have been performed in a nuclear physics laboratory running 
particle detectors, complex multi-purpose digitally controlled power 
adapters and lots of additional equipment. The electric grid topology of the 
laboratory is way more complex than the average and the electrical ground 
was extremely noisy, substantially more than a normal scenario.
The bottom line is that the test performed in the laboratory represent a 
worst case scenario for this type of measurement, which along with 
acceptable results emphasizes the feasibility of the attack on normal 
conditions.
We measured the potential difference on the ground write routed from power 
plugs at 1, 5, 10, 15 meters from the actual target, due to the complex 
topology of the laboratory electrical system several junction boxes where 
present between the target computer plug and the sniffing device.
In all cases using a digital oscilloscope as an ADC, by sampling and storing 
the potential difference data, it is possible to obtain data about the 
ground wire "activity".
While the unfiltered signal apparently doesn't feature any useful 
information it was possible to successfully filter out the individual 
keystrokes from the original ground noise using the FIR filter. The PS/2 
signal square wave is preserved with good quality (slightly modified by the 
anticipated artifacts introduced by the filter) and can be decoded back to 
the original kyestroke information.
There has been no significant degradation of signal quality between the 1 
meter distance test and the 15 meters one, suggesting that attenuation is 
not a concern at this range.
It should be noted that attenuation coefficients for wire copper are often 
estimated for much higher frequencies (>1Mhz) than the PS/2 signal, 
considering a typical copper cable with a coefficient of 0.1 dB after 60m 
theoretically (strong emphasis here) 50% of the signal survives. For 
reference a typical leakage emission has an output power of ~1 pW (10^-12 
Watt).
In conclusion the results clearly show that information about the keyboard 
keystrokes indeed leaks on the power grid and can be remotely detected.
We are confident that more expensive and sophisticated equipment can lead to 
much better measurements at a longer range.
--[ 8. First Attack - Attack Scenario and Workarounds
A good attack scenario for this kind of attack obviously involves the 
attacker being in a different room/area than the victim computer. In 
offices, houses, hotels it would be fairly easy to secure an attack spot 
with a power plug connected to the same electrical system as the victim 
room, possibly on the floor below or the adjacent room.
Other than diplomats, neighbours, ex-girlfriends and so on, it is worth to 
mention that an appealing category of targets are ATM/PoS machines and 
similar banking devices. Several ATM models in Europe are standard PCs with 
PS/2 (or similar) keypads and no strong electromagnetic leak shielding, 
depending on their location they are likely to share the same electrical 
system of the nearby shop or area.
The fact that the digits of the PIN code are the only input of the keypad 
narrows down the analysis required for retrieving it (of course we feel 
compelled to note that if the attacker has line of sight to the keypad it is 
more cost effective to simply point a zoom camera at the keypad).
The main workaround for this attack (other than obviously using laptops 
which are not connected to the power socket and have shielded power supplied 
anyway) is effective shielding of the RF emanations of the PC equipment. 
TEMPEST standards exist which define a series of protection requirements, 
but they haven't been completely declassified.
Extensive amount of tinfoil is not an effective workaround and it has been 
proved to make things worse in some scenarios.[4]
It is believed that USB keyboards are not affected by this attack as they 
use differential signaling for cancelling the noise, though USB 
microcontrollers within the keyboard are much more noisy than PS/2 ones and 
there is a chance that some fortuitous emanations might be present.
--[ 9. Second Attack - Theory
As the first attack does not work against laptops something different was 
needed for attacking this target.
