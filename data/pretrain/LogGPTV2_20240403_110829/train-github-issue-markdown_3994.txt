# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Right now, you can either remap key to a key or shortcut to a shortcut.
I'd like a way to remap shortcut to a key. Why?
Well, I have Surface Keyboard Bluetooth, which special keys. Some are usual
ones like Next, Previous, Play/Pause. But some are Windows specific (like
Settings or Connect external display).
I don't use the latter ones and they overlap with Fxx keys that I actually use
often and have to use Fn key to access them.
So I'd like to remap them back to Fxx. Thing is, Windows does not see them as
a single key, but as a strange shortcut (for example Settings are Win Left +
F21). I'd like to remap this back to F12 (so I don't have to use Fn), but
right now I can't.
