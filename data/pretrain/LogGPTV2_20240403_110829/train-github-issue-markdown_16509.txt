I just moved to using 3.0 version of OpenCV. This error seems to follow me. I
have treid cleaning the project, moving to 3.1, but I cant seem to figure out
what I'm missing:
    $ cmake .
    -- OpenCV ARCH: 
    -- OpenCV RUNTIME: 
    -- OpenCV STATIC: ON
    CMake Warning at /Applications/opencv-3.1.0/cmake/OpenCVConfig.cmake:166 (message):
      Found OpenCV Windows Pack but it has no binaries compatible with your
      configuration.
      You should manually point CMake variable OpenCV_DIR to your build of OpenCV
      library.
    Call Stack (most recent call first):
      CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package)
    CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
      Found package configuration file:
        /Applications/opencv-3.1.0/cmake/OpenCVConfig.cmake
      but it set OpenCV_FOUND to FALSE so package "OpenCV" is considered to be
      NOT FOUND.
    -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Any tips on tackling this will help. I am building OpenCV on OSX El Capitan. I
am not sure if this is a problem with cmake or opencv. Envorinment variables
seem to be correct. Thanks!
