I recently upgraded to OpenCV 3.0 and have encountered an error that persists even after trying several solutions, including cleaning the project and upgrading to OpenCV 3.1. I am unable to determine what I might be missing. Here is the error message I receive:

```plaintext
$ cmake .
-- OpenCV ARCH: 
-- OpenCV RUNTIME: 
-- OpenCV STATIC: ON
CMake Warning at /Applications/opencv-3.1.0/cmake/OpenCVConfig.cmake:166 (message):
  Found OpenCV Windows Pack but it has no binaries compatible with your
  configuration.
  You should manually point CMake variable OpenCV_DIR to your build of OpenCV
  library.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package)
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  Found package configuration file:
    /Applications/opencv-3.1.0/cmake/OpenCVConfig.cmake
  but it set OpenCV_FOUND to FALSE so package "OpenCV" is considered to be
  NOT FOUND.
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
```

I am building OpenCV on macOS El Capitan, and I am uncertain whether the issue lies with CMake or OpenCV. My environment variables appear to be correctly set. Any advice on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
