# Bug report
## Describe the bug
When I add for example 5 files in "pages" folder, and add classic "Link"
routing - it works until I do 1-2 minutes break. After 2 minutes when I try to
use site there work only 2 routes - rest don't react. Hot reload still works
fine, everything works good except this routing. (hrefs with reload works good
- only SPA style routing breaking after 2 minutes awaiting.
## To Reproduce
  1. Download my repo from: https://github.com/kegriz/next-routing-issue
  2. install packages: yarn (or nmp install)
  3. start dev project: yarn run dev (or npm run dev)
  4. open website at http://localhost:3000
  5. click on every subpage by links
  6. last click on for example "aaa"
  7. wait 2 minutes without any activity
## Expected behavior
After this time there should by only 2 links working correctly.
