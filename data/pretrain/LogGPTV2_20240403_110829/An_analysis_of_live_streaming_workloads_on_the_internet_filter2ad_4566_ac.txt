Figure 6: Arrivals for a radio station over a one week period.
peaks correspond to the weekend. The corresponding arrival rates
in number of clients/minute are shown in Figure 6(b). Note that
the arrivals roughly mirror the weekly and daily trends in the group
membership pattern. Over the course of a day, the arrival rates vary
from 5 arrivals/minute to up to 20 arrivals/minute.
To better understand the time-of-day behavior, we break the
group membership down by country. We map client IP addresses
to their geographic location. Figure 6(a) depicts the group member-
ship over time for the top 3 participating countries: the UK, the US,
and Poland (labelled PL). The daily peaks in the group member-
ship are shifted by several hours. The peak for PL occurs roughly
2 hours before the peak in UK. And, the peak in the US follows
the UK peak by roughly 4-5 hours. This clearly re(cid:3)ects time-of-
day differences as the clients of this one event are scattered across
multiple time zones. Interestingly, however, the peaks always occur
at around 3-4pm local time. The arrival rates, not shown, are also
shifted accordingly. When modeling arrival processes, one must
also consider different arrival rates for clients from different time
zones.
5.1.3 Flash Crowds
This particular stream is interesting in that in addition to the
weekly and daily cyclical trends, there is also some (cid:3)ash crowd
behavior where the arrivals peak as high as 40 arrivals/minute com-
pared to the usual 20 arrivals/minute. Flash crowds occurred on 3
separate days, on the 15th, 16th and 17th. US clients caused the
(cid:3)ash crowds on the 15th and 17th, whereas UK clients caused a
smaller (cid:3)ash crowd on the 16th.
Our observations for this particular radio station holds for many
other non-stop streams. For short duration streams, we see less
time-of-day and time-zone related behavior, as client requests are
perhaps driven by the content itself. Perhaps people are willing to
tune in to a short duration stream at 4am in the morning if the con-
tent is meaningful to them. One interesting observation is that all

short duration streams exhibit (cid:3)ash crowd behavior, and some non-
stop streams such as the one in Figure 6 also exhibit (cid:3)ash crowd
behavior on some days. Overall, we (cid:2)nd that 50% of large streams
have (cid:3)ash crowds as reported in Section 4.4.
5.2 Session Duration
5.2.1 High›Level Characteristics
Figure 7 depicts the mean and median session duration times in
minutes for all the DailyTop40 streams from all days, separated into
large streams vs. the remaining smaller streams in the DailyTop40.
The (cid:2)rst two curves on the right correspond to the mean and median
session durations for large streams, whereas the two curves on the
left correspond to the remaining smaller streams.
As one would expect, large streams have much larger session
durations than smaller streams.
In terms of statistical measures
of correlation, we (cid:2)nd that the correlation coef(cid:2)cient between a
group’s peak size and its median session duration is small at 0.2,
but the Spearman’s rank correlation is much stronger at 0.7. Rank
correlation gives a picture of how the rank of the streams sorted
by peak group size agrees with the rank sorted by median session
duration.
We make two additional observations from Figure 7. First, for
a small portion of the streams, the median session duration is ex-
tremely small(cid:150)less than 10 seconds. While we do not know the
actual cause of such small session durations, we hypothesize that
some of it may be caused by (cid:147)channel sur(cid:2)ng.(cid:148) Such small val-
ues can have implications on systems design. The group member-
ship for the stream is changing very rapidly. This indicates that the
servers should quickly time-out on per-session state (for example,
TCP time-outs should be short such that sockets can be freed for
newer connections),and servers should do only a minimal amount
of work to set up a session as it will be shut down quickly.
Our second observation is that, for large streams, the session
durations are heavy tailed as the observed mean is much larger than
the median for all sessions. There are a few clients who tune in to
the content for very long periods, whereas most clients only stay for
much shorter periods. The (cid:2)rst curve from the right depicts the CDF
of the observed mean session duration for all large streams. For
example, all large streams had a mean session duration larger than
30 minutes, and almost all (99.7%) had a mean session duration of
more than an hour. While the mean is large for most sessions, the
median is much shorter, as depicted by the second curve from the

About 40% of streams had median session durations of shorter than
20 minutes.
5.2.2 Tail Analysis
Next, we focus our session duration analysis on the tail of the
distributions for all large streams, where the tail is de(cid:2)ned as the last
10% of the distribution. Typically, when modeling session duration
distributions, the head and the tail should be modeled using differ-
ent distributions. We (cid:2)nd that the head of the duration distribution
for large streams generally (cid:2)ts a log-normal distribution, which is
consistent with previous (cid:2)ndings [23]. We did not conduct the tail
analysis on smaller streams because there are an insuf(cid:2)cient num-
ber of data points. For large streams, the total number of data points
for each stream ranged from 10,000-100,000, which we believe is
suf(cid:2)cient for tail analysis.
We use the complementary cumulative distribution (CCDF) to
analyze the tail of the distributions. The CCDF is de(cid:2)ned as the
probability that a value of greater than 
where 
is the CDF of a random variable X. Intuitively, a dis-
tribution is heavy-tailed if the CCDF is linear when plot in log-log
scale.
is observed, or 
We break up the analysis into non-stop vs. short streams. Fig-
ure 8(a) depicts the CCDF for all non-stop streams. Each line rep-
resents a stream. The tail is the last 10% of the data in the region
below 0.1 on the y-axis and generally falling between 30 and 10,000
minutes on the x-axis. There are 2 distinct shapes for the tail. The
group of lines towards the right of the graph have a linear tail, ex-
hibiting Pareto heavy-tailed behavior. These correspond to non-stop
events that have (cid:147)always fresh content,(cid:148) such as radio stations. Ev-
ery second, the content is different and newly created. The second
set of curves have a characteristic (cid:147)drop(cid:148) in the CCDF at around
30 minutes. However, after the 30 minute mark, the rest of the
tail looks fairly linear, exhibiting Pareto heavy-tailed behavior. The
drop at 30 minutes corresponds to a periodic event. We (cid:2)nd that for
these streams, the content cycles every 30 minutes. An example is
a radio station that plays only headline news. Users do not wish to
listen for more than one cycle at a time. We used aest [7] to estimate

the tail and found that for non-stop streams, 

events. The common feature is a cut-off point, where the tail abruptly

drops off in the region between 100 and 1,000 minutes on the x-axis.
The value at the cut-off point corresponds to the stream duration
(for example, there were many streams whose cut-off points were
at approximately 3 hours, for a 3-hour talk show). Note that this
feature is present irrespective of whether or not the content is audio
or video. One interesting observation is that even with the cut-off
point, the session duration distribution has a tail. The data can be
modeled by using a (cid:147)truncated(cid:148) Pareto distribution. To generate
data points based on the model, we (cid:2)rst estimate the tail parame-
ter by extrapolating a line from the curvature of the tail as if there
were no abrupt cut-off point. Using the extrapolated tail parameter,
we generate a random distribution. Any generated data point with
a value larger than the real cut-off point is truncated to the cut-off
value. Using aest to estimate the tail, we found that for all short
Interestingly, for the 3 different tail behaviors, only one, the
non-stop with always fresh content, is caused by user behavior. The
other two tails are a result of the nature of the content in that either
the content cycles and effective (cid:147)ends(cid:148), or the stream terminates in
the case of short events.
5.3 Implications
The combination of session arrival and duration characteristics
provide us with group membership dynamics which are useful for
evaluating design and architectural choices. For example, we re-
cently looked at the in(cid:3)uence of the group membership dynamics
analyzed in this study on the stability of a peer-to-peer streaming
system [22].
In a peer-to-peer system, there is no stable infras-
tructure. When a peer leaves the system (i.e., stops watching the
stream), some of the other peers in the overlay structure may be-
come disconnected and not receive any streaming content. A de-
sirable overlay structure is one in which there are minimum disrup-
tions. We found that it is feasible to construct stable overlays despite
many hosts staying for very short periods. The key insight is that
there is a tail(cid:150)there are a few hosts who stay for very long periods
and these hosts can be used to create stability in the overlay struc-
ture. Overall, our (cid:2)ndings indicate that peer-to-peer architectures
can have stability under realistic group membership dynamics.
6. WHAT IS THE TRANSPORT PROTOCOL?
In this section, we look at the transport protocol used to stream
content between servers and clients. Generally, UDP is more ap-

propriate for streaming because it allows the application to have full
control of buffering and retransmission of data. TCP, on the other
hand, has strict reliability semantics which may be in con(cid:3)ict with
the real-time requirements of live streaming.
Most of the recent versions of the media players, by default,
will automatically probe the network to determine the best trans-
port protocol to use. Network address translators (NATs), (cid:2)rewalls
and ISPs on the path between a client and a server may disallow cer-
tain protocols, and probing allows media players to discover which
protocols may be used. For example, UDP may not be available for
a host behind a (cid:2)rewall that (cid:2)lters UDP. Generally, players prefer
UDP over TCP, and will use UDP unless (i) it is not available, or
(ii) the user intervenes and con(cid:2)gures the player to use TCP. We
hypothesize that user intervention is not common.
Figure 9 depicts the percentage of sessions seen using each
transport protocol. QuickTime and Real have predominantly UDP
traf(cid:2)c. However, roughly 40% of sessions are being streamed using
TCP. Given that this is consistent across the two formats, we spec-
ulate that this may be capturing the state of UDP (cid:2)ltering on the
Internet.
To understand whether the use of transport protocols is speci(cid:2)c

tries in Table 2. Each region is determined to be TCP-dominant or
