## Abstract
Internet memes are increasingly being used to influence and manipulate public opinion. This necessitates a deeper understanding of their propagation, evolution, and impact across the web. In this paper, we employ a processing pipeline based on perceptual hashing and clustering techniques to detect and measure the spread of memes across multiple web communities. Our dataset includes 160 million images from 2.6 billion posts gathered from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/), and Gab over 13 months. We group images posted on fringe web communities (/pol/, Gab, and The_Donald subreddit) into clusters, annotate them using metadata from Know Your Meme, and map images from mainstream communities (Twitter and Reddit) to these clusters. Our analysis provides insights into the popularity and diversity of memes within each community, revealing, for example, that racist memes are prevalent in fringe web communities. We also find a significant number of politically themed memes in both mainstream and fringe communities, supporting media reports that memes can be used to enhance or harm politicians. Using Hawkes processes, we model the interplay between web communities and quantify their reciprocal influence, finding that /pol/ significantly influences the meme ecosystem through the volume of memes it produces, while The_Donald has a higher success rate in pushing memes to other communities.

## 1 Introduction
The internet has become a powerful medium for the dissemination of ideas and culture. Images, videos, and slogans are created and shared online at an unprecedented pace. Some of these, commonly referred to as memes, go viral, evolve, and eventually enter popular culture. Richard Dawkins coined the term "meme" to describe cultural analogues to genes, capable of self-replication, mutation, and response to selective pressures. Many memes have become integral to internet culture, such as Trollface, Bad Luck Brian, and Rickroll.

While most memes are generally lighthearted and used without malicious intent, some have taken on negative and hateful connotations, including racist and aggressive undertones. These memes, often generated by fringe communities, are being "weaponized" and used in political and ideological propaganda. For example, during the 2016 US Presidential Elections, candidates adopted memes as part of their iconography, and Donald Trump retweeted an image depicting him as Pepe the Frog, a controversial character considered a hate symbol. Polarized communities within 4chan and Reddit have been working to create and spread new memes to increase the visibility of their ideas, a phenomenon known as "attention hacking."

Despite their growing importance, there are few measurements and computational tools to understand the origins and influence of memes. The online information ecosystem is complex, with social networks influencing each other in the spread of information. However, previous research has primarily focused on individual social networks in isolation.

In this paper, we aim to bridge these gaps by addressing several research questions related to fringe web communities:
1. How can we characterize memes, and how do they evolve and propagate?
2. Can we track meme propagation across multiple communities and measure their influence?
3. How can we study variants of the same meme?
4. Can we characterize web communities through the lens of memes?

Our work focuses on four web communities: Twitter, Reddit, Gab, and 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/), due to their impact on the information ecosystem and anecdotal evidence of disseminating weaponized memes. We design a processing pipeline and apply it to 160 million images posted between July 2016 and July 2017. Our pipeline uses perceptual hashing (pHash) and clustering techniques to extract feature vectors from images and detect groups of images that are part of the same meme. We also introduce a custom distance metric based on pHash and meme metadata from Know Your Meme (KYM) to understand the interplay between different memes. Finally, using Hawkes processes, we quantify the reciprocal influence of each web community in the dissemination of image-based memes.

### Findings
Some of our key findings include:
1. Our influence estimation analysis reveals that /pol/ and The_Donald are influential actors in the meme ecosystem, despite their modest size. /pol/ substantially influences the meme ecosystem by posting a large number of memes, while The_Donald is the most efficient community in pushing memes to both fringe and mainstream web communities.
2. Communities within 4chan, Reddit, and Gab use memes to share hateful and racist content. For instance, among the most popular clusters of memes, we find variants of the anti-Semitic "Happy Merchant" meme and the controversial Pepe the Frog.
3. Our custom distance metric effectively reveals the phylogenetic relationships of clusters of images, as shown in the graph available for exploration at [1].

### Contributions
1. We develop a robust processing pipeline for detecting and tracking memes across multiple web communities, supporting large-scale measurements of meme ecosystems.
2. We introduce a custom distance metric to highlight hidden correlations between memes and better understand their interplay and overlap.
3. We provide a characterization of multiple web communities (Twitter, Reddit, Gab, and /pol/) with respect to the memes they share, and an analysis of their reciprocal influence using the Hawkes Processes statistical model.
4. We release our processing pipeline and datasets (available at [3]), supporting further research in this area.

## 2 Methodology
### 2.1 Overview
Memes are high-level concepts or ideas that spread within a culture. In internet vernacular, a meme usually refers to variants of a particular image, video, cliché, etc., that share a common theme and are disseminated by a large number of users. In this paper, we focus on static images.

To understand how memes propagate across the web, with a particular focus on discovering the communities that are most influential in spreading them, we build clusters of visually similar images. This allows us to track variants of a meme and then group clusters that belong to the same meme to study and track the meme itself. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of the Smug Frog meme, which includes many variants of the same image and several clusters of variants. Cluster 1 features variants from a Jurassic Park scene, where one of the characters is hiding from two velociraptors behind a kitchen counter. The frogs are stylized to look like velociraptors, and the character hiding varies to express a particular message. For example, in the top right corner, the two frogs are searching for an anti-Semitic caricature of a Jew. Cluster N shows variants of the smug frog wearing a Nazi officer military cap with the infamous "Arbeit macht frei" in the background. Overall, these clusters represent the branching nature of memes: as a new variant becomes prevalent, it often branches into its own sub-meme, potentially incorporating imagery from other memes.

### 2.2 Processing Pipeline
We now introduce our processing pipeline, as shown in Figure 2. Our methodology aims to identify clusters of similar images and assign them to higher-level groups, which are the actual memes. Note that the proposed pipeline is not limited to image macros and can be used to identify any image. We first discuss the types of data sources needed for our approach, i.e., meme annotation sites and web communities that post memes (dotted rounded rectangles in the figure). Then, we describe each of the operations performed by our pipeline (Steps 1-7, see regular rectangles).

#### Data Sources
Our pipeline uses two types of data sources:
1. Sites providing meme annotation (e.g., Know Your Meme).
2. Web communities that disseminate memes (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, /pol/, and Gab).

However, our methodology supports any annotation site and any web community, which is why we add the "Generic" sites/communities notation in Figure 2.

#### pHash Extraction (Step 1)
We use the Perceptual Hashing (pHash) algorithm to calculate a fingerprint of each image. pHash generates a feature vector of 64 elements that describe an image, computed from the Discrete Cosine Transform among the different frequency domains of the image.

#### Clustering (Step 2)
We use clustering algorithms to group images with similar pHash values into clusters. This allows us to capture the diversity of images that are part of the same meme while maintaining a low number of false positives.

#### Annotation (Step 3)
We annotate clusters using metadata from Know Your Meme (KYM). As the annotation process considers all the images of a KYM entry's image gallery, it is likely we will get multiple annotations for a single cluster. To find the representative KYM entry for each cluster, we select the one with the largest proportion of matches of KYM images with the cluster medoid. In case of ties, we select the one with the minimum average Hamming distance.

To evaluate KYM entries and our cluster annotations, three authors of this paper assessed 200 annotated clusters and 162 KYM entries. We found that only 1.85% of the assessed KYM entries were regarded as "bad" or insufficient. The clustering accuracy, after majority agreement, of the assessed clusters is 89%. Details about the annotation process and results are provided in Appendix B.

#### Association of Images to Memes (Step 6)
To associate images posted on web communities (e.g., Twitter, Reddit) to memes, we compare them with the clusters' medoids using the same threshold θ. This lets us identify memes posted in generic web communities and collect relevant metadata from the posts (e.g., the timestamp of a tweet). We track the propagation of memes in generic web communities using a seed of memes obtained by clustering images from fringe web communities. Specifically, our seeds are memes generated on three fringe web communities (/pol/, The_Donald subreddit, Gab).

#### Analysis and Influence Estimation (Step 7)
We analyze all relevant clusters and the occurrences of memes, aiming to assess:
1. Their popularity and diversity in each community.
2. Their temporal evolution.
3. How communities influence each other with respect to meme dissemination (see Sections 4 and 5).

### 2.3 Distance Metric
To better understand the interplay and connections between clusters, we introduce a custom distance metric that relies on both the visual peculiarities of the images (via pHash) and data available from annotation sites. The distance metric supports two modes:
1. Full-mode: When both clusters are annotated.
2. Partial-mode: When one or none of the clusters is annotated.

**Definition:**
Let \( c \) be a cluster of images and \( F \) a set of features extracted from the clusters. The custom distance metric between cluster \( c_i \) and \( c_j \) is defined as:

\[
\text{distance}(c_i, c_j) = 1 - \sum_{f \in F} w_f \times r_f(c_i, c_j)
\]

where \( r_f(c_i, c_j) \) denotes the similarity between the features of type \( f \) in clusters \( c_i \) and \( c_j \), and \( w_f \) represents the relevance of each feature.
