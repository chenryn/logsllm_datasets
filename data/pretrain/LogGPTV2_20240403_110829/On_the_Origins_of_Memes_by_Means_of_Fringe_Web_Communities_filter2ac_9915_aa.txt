ABSTRACT
Internet memes are increasingly used to sway and manipulate pub-
lic opinion. This prompts the need to study their propagation, evo-
lution, and influence across the Web. In this paper, we detect and
measure the propagation of memes across multiple Web commu-
nities, using a processing pipeline based on perceptual hashing
and clustering techniques, and a dataset of 160M images from 2.6B
posts gathered from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan’s Politically Incorrect
board (/pol/), and Gab, over the course of 13 months. We group
the images posted on fringe Web communities (/pol/, Gab, and
The_Donald subreddit) into clusters, annotate them using meme
metadata obtained from Know Your Meme, and also map images
from mainstream communities (Twitter and Reddit) to the clusters.
Our analysis provides an assessment of the popularity and diver-
sity of memes in the context of each community, showing, e.g., that
racist memes are extremely common in fringe Web communities.
We also find a substantial number of politics-related memes on both
mainstream and fringe Web communities, supporting media reports
that memes might be used to enhance or harm politicians. Finally,
we use Hawkes processes to model the interplay between Web
communities and quantify their reciprocal influence, finding that
/pol/ substantially influences the meme ecosystem with the number
of memes it produces, while The_Donald has a higher success rate
in pushing them to other communities.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Web has become one of the most impactful vehicles for the
propagation of ideas and culture. Images, videos, and slogans are
created and shared online at an unprecedented pace. Some of these,
commonly referred to as memes, become viral, evolve, and eventu-
ally enter popular culture. The term “meme” was first coined by
Richard Dawkins [11], who framed them as cultural analogues to
genes, as they too self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective
pressures [17]. Numerous memes have become integral part of Inter-
net culture, with well-known examples including the Trollface [49],
Bad Luck Brian [25], and Rickroll [44].
While most memes are generally ironic in nature, used with no
bad intentions, others have assumed negative and/or hateful con-
notations, including outright racist and aggressive undertones [71].
These memes, often generated by fringe communities, are being
“weaponized” and even becoming part of political and ideological
propaganda [61]. For example, memes were adopted by candidates
during the 2016 US Presidential Elections as part of their iconogra-
phy [18]; in October 2015, then-candidate Donald Trump retweeted
an image depicting him as Pepe The Frog, a controversial character
considered a hate symbol [53]. In this context, polarized communi-
ties within 4chan and Reddit have been working hard to create new
memes and make them go viral, aiming to increase the visibility of
their ideas—a phenomenon known as “attention hacking” [59].
Despite their increasingly relevant role, we have very little mea-
surements and computational tools to understand the origins and
the influence of memes. The online information ecosystem is very
complex; social networks do not operate in a vacuum but rather
influence each other as to how information spreads [74]. However,
previous work (see Sec. 6) has mostly focused on social networks
in an isolated manner.
In this paper, we aim to bridge these gaps by identifying and
addressing a few research questions, which are oriented towards
fringe Web communities: 1) How can we characterize memes, and
how do they evolve and propagate? 2) Can we track meme propa-
gation across multiple communities and measure their influence?

3) How can we study variants of the same meme? 4) Can we char-
acterize Web communities through the lens of memes?
Our work focuses on four Web communities: Twitter, Reddit,
Gab, and 4chan’s Politically Incorrect board (/pol/), because of their
impact on the information ecosystem [74] and anecdotal evidence of
them disseminating weaponized memes [65]. We design a process-
ing pipeline and use it over 160M images posted between July 2016
and July 2017. Our pipeline relies on perceptual hashing (pHash)
and clustering techniques; the former extracts representative fea-
ture vectors from the images encapsulating their visual peculiarities,
while the latter allow us to detect groups of images that are part
of the same meme. We design and implement a custom distance
metric, based on both pHash and meme metadata, obtained from
Know Your Meme (KYM), and use it to understand the interplay
between the different memes. Finally, using Hawkes processes, we
quantify the reciprocal influence of each Web community with
respect to the dissemination of image-based memes.
Findings. Some of our findings (among others) include:
(1) Our influence estimation analysis reveals that /pol/ and
The_Donald are influential actors in the meme ecosystem,
despite their modest size. We find that /pol/ substantially
influences the meme ecosystem by posting a large number
of memes, while The_Donald is the most efficient commu-
nity in pushing memes to both fringe and mainstream Web
communities.
(2) Communities within 4chan, Reddit, and Gab use memes to
share hateful and racist content. For instance, among the
most popular cluster of memes, we find variants of the anti-
semitic “Happy Merchant” meme [32] and the controversial
Pepe the Frog [40].
(3) Our custom distance metric effectively reveals the phylo-
genetic relationships of clusters of images. This is evident
from the graph that shows the clusters obtained from /pol/,
Reddit’s The_Donald subreddit, and Gab available for explo-
ration at [1].
Contributions. First, we develop a robust processing pipeline for
detecting and tracking memes across multiple Web communities.
Based on pHash and clustering algorithms, it supports large-scale
measurements of meme ecosystems. Second, we introduce a custom
distance metric, geared to highlight hidden correlations between
memes and better understand the interplay and overlap between
them. Third, we provide a characterization of multiple Web commu-
nities (Twitter, Reddit, Gab, and /pol/) with respect to the memes
they share, and an analysis of their reciprocal influence using the
Hawkes Processes statistical model. Finally, we release our pro-
cessing pipeline and datasets (available at [3]), hence supportting
further measurements in this space.
2 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we present our methodology for measuring the
propagation of memes across Web communities.
2.1 Overview
Memes are high-level concepts or ideas that spread within a cul-
ture [11]. In Internet vernacular, a meme usually refers to variants
of a particular image, video, cliché, etc. that share a common theme
Figure 1: An example of a meme (Smug Frog) that provides an intu-
ition of what an image, a cluster, and a meme is.
and are disseminated by a large number of users. In this paper, we
focus on their most common incarnation: static images.
To gain an understanding of how memes propagate across the
Web, with a particular focus on discovering the communities that
are most influential in spreading them, our intuition is to build
clusters of visually similar images, allowing us to track variants of
a meme. We then group clusters that belong to the same meme
to study and track the meme itself. In Fig. 1, we provide a visual
representation of the Smug Frog meme [47], which includes many
variants of the same image and several clusters of variants. Cluster 1
has variants from a Jurassic Park scene, where one of the characters
is hiding from two velociraptors behind a kitchen counter: the frogs
are stylized to look similar to velociraptors, and the character hiding
varies to express a particular message. For example, in the image
in the top right corner, the two frogs are searching for an anti-
semitic caricature of a Jew. Cluster N shows variants of the smug
frog wearing a Nazi officer military cap with the infamous “Arbeit
macht frei” in the background. Overall, these clusters represent the
branching nature of memes: as a new variant of a meme becomes
prevalent, it often branches into its own sub-meme, potentially
incorporating imagery from other memes.
2.2 Processing Pipeline
We now introduce our processing pipeline; see Fig. 2. As discussed
in Sec. 2.1, our methodology aims at identifying clusters of similar
images and assign them to higher level groups, which are the actual
memes. Note that the proposed pipeline is not limited to image
macros and can be used to identify any image. We first discuss the
types of data sources needed for our approach, i.e., meme annota-
tion sites and Web communities that post memes (dotted rounded
rectangles in the figure). Then, we describe each of the operations
performed by our pipeline (Steps 1-7, see regular rectangles).
Data Sources. Our pipeline uses two types of data sources: 1) sites
providing meme annotation and 2) Web communities that dissemi-
nate memes. In this paper, we use Know Your Meme for the former,
and Twitter, Reddit, /pol/, and Gab for the latter (see Sec. 3). How-
ever, our methodology supports any annotation site and any Web
community, and this is why we add the “Generic” sites/communities
notation in Fig. 2.
pHash Extraction (Step 1). We use the Perceptual Hashing (pHash)
algorithm [60] to calculate a fingerprint of each image in such a
way that any two images that look similar to the human eye map
to a “similar” hash value. pHash generates a feature vector of 64 el-
ements that describe an image, computed from the Discrete Cosine
Transform among the different frequency domains of the image.

us to capture the diversity of images that are part of the same meme
while maintaining a low number of false positives.
As the annotation process considers all the images of a KYM
entry’s image gallery, it is likely we will get multiple annotations
for a single cluster. To find the representative KYM entry for each
cluster, we select the one with the largest proportion of matches of
KYM images with the cluster medoid. In case of ties, we select the
one with the minimum average Hamming distance.
As KYM is based on community contributions it is unclear how
good our annotations are. To evaluate KYM entries and our cluster
annotations, three authors of this paper assessed 200 annotated
clusters and 162 KYM entries. We find that only a 1.85% of the
assessed KYM entries were regarded as “bad” or not sufficient.
When it comes to the clustering annotation, we note that the three
annotators had substantial agreement (Fleis agreement score equal
to 0.67) and that the clustering accuracy, after majority agreement,
of the assessed clusters is 89% . We refer to Appendix B for details
about the annotation process and results.
Association of images to memes (Step 6). To associate images
posted on Web communities (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, etc.) to memes, we
compare them with the clusters’ medoids, using the same threshold
θ. This is conceptually similar to Step 5, but uses images from
Web communities instead of images from annotation sites. This
lets us identify memes posted in generic Web communities and
collect relevant metadata from the posts (e.g., the timestamp of a
tweet). Note that we track the propagation of memes in generic
Web communities (e.g., Twitter) using a seed of memes obtained
by clustering images from other (fringe) Web communities. More
specifically, our seeds will be memes generated on three fringe Web
communities (/pol/, The_Donald subreddit, Gab); nonetheless, our
methodology can be applied to any community.
Analysis and Influence Estimation (Step 7). We analyze all rel-
evant clusters and the occurrences of memes, aiming to assess:
1) their popularity and diversity in each community; 2) their tem-
poral evolution; 3) how communities influence each other with
respect to meme dissemination (see Sec. 4 and 5).
2.3 Distance Metric
To better understand the interplay and connections between the
clusters, we introduce a custom distance metric, which relies on
both the visual peculiarities of the images (via pHash) and data
available from annotation sites. The distance metric supports one of
two modes: 1) one for when both clusters are annotated (full-mode),
and 2) another for when one or none of the clusters is annotated
(partial-mode).
Definition. Let c be a cluster of images and F a set of features
extracted from the clusters. The custom distance metric between
cluster ci and cj is defined as:
wf × rf (ci, cj )
(1)
distance(ci, cj ) = 1 −(cid:88)

where rf (ci , cj ) denotes the similarity between the features of type
