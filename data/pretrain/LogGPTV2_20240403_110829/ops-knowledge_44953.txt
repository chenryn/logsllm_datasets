User: On a Windows server, how to configure and manage the IIS web server, and how to optimize web application performance.
Assistant: 1. Steps to configure and manage IIS Web server: 1) Open the control panel, click "Programs", and select "Enable or close Windows features". 2) In the pop-up "Windows Features" dialog box, find "IIS Manager". 3) Select "IIS Manager", click "OK", and wait for the installation to complete. 4) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect. 5) Open IIS Manager, find "Site" in the left panel and select this item. 6) Right click on "Default Web Site" and select "Add Web Site". 7) In the pop-up "Add Website" dialog box, enter the website name and its corresponding physical path (that is, the location of the folder where the website is located). 8) Select the port number and IP address used by the website. 9) Enter the website's domain name in the "Hostname" text box, or use the "All unspecified" option. 10) Click OK to save the settings and close the dialog. 11) Enter the URL of the website in the browser to test whether an IIS website has been successfully created. 2. Optimize web application performance In order to improve web application performance, the following are some optimization measures: 1) Use CDN to accelerate Storing static assets (such as CSS files, images and JavaScript code) on CDN can improve the speed of the website and reduce the server load. on the load. 2) Reduce the image size By reducing the image size to reduce the bandwidth required for network transmission, the performance of web applications can be greatly improved. 3) Reduce the number and size of files Reducing the number and size of files can reduce the bandwidth required for network transmission, thereby improving Web application performance. 4) Optimize database queries By writing efficient SQL queries and setting correct indexes, you can greatly reduce query time and improve web application performance. 5) Browser caching By setting appropriate caching headers in the HTTP response header, the browser can cache web pages and static assets, thereby reducing the bandwidth required for network transmission. 6) Gzip Compression By using Gzip compression, you can reduce the response size in your web application by more than 40%, thus increasing the speed of your web application without losing quality. 7) Use caching Using caching can improve the performance of web applications because it reduces the number of accesses to the physical hard disk and reduces the load on the database. Using caching can reduce the number of database queries and increase the speed of web applications. 8) Using CDN cache Using CDN cache can improve the performance of web applications, because it can store data in globally distributed servers, thereby improving data access speed and reducing network transmission.
