User: I am very very new in Python and I have a doubt.
If I write a program in a text editor (such as Nodepad++), then can I execute it from the Python shell (the one that begin with >>)? What command have I to launch to execute my Python program?
Tnx
Andrea
Assistant: Exit python interpreter/console.
Edit your program in notepad++ creating first_program.py in the same directory where your python.exe is
start cmd.exe from within exactly the same directory
type python first_program.py*

you are done
