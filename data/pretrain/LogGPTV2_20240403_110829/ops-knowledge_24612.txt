### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, spanning from 18:08:26 to 18:08:31 on 10-18, documents multiple issues related to resource management and lease renewal in a Hadoop environment. The key points are as follows:

1. **RM Communication Errors**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` component repeatedly encounters errors while trying to contact the Resource Manager (RM) at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system attempts to reconnect to the RM using a retry policy with a maximum of 10 retries and a fixed sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.
   - Each reconnection attempt is logged, and the error persists throughout the log period.

2. **Address Change Detection**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component detects address changes for both the RM and the Lease Renewer.
   - The old address for the RM is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, and it changes to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - Similarly, the old address for the Lease Renewer is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and it changes to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

3. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component fails to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1` multiple times.
   - The duration of the lease renewal failure increases from 209 seconds to 214 seconds over the log period.
   - The system logs a warning and indicates that it will retry shortly after each failure.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamp: 18:08:26**
  - **Error**: RM communication error.
  - **Warning**: Address change detected for the RM and Lease Renewer.
  - **Warning**: Lease renewal failure for 209 seconds.

- **Timestamp: 18:08:27**
  - **Warning**: Address change detected for the RM and Lease Renewer.
  - **Warning**: Lease renewal failure for 210 seconds.

- **Timestamp: 18:08:28**
  - **Info**: Attempting to reconnect to the RM (retry count: 0).
  - **Error**: RM communication error.
  - **Warning**: Address change detected for the RM and Lease Renewer.
  - **Warning**: Lease renewal failure for 211 seconds.

- **Timestamp: 18:08:29**
  - **Warning**: Address change detected for the RM and Lease Renewer.
  - **Warning**: Lease renewal failure for 212 seconds.

- **Timestamp: 18:08:30**
  - **Info**: Attempting to reconnect to the RM (retry count: 0).
  - **Error**: RM communication error.
  - **Warning**: Address change detected for the RM and Lease Renewer.
  - **Warning**: Lease renewal failure for 213 seconds.

### Conclusion

The log indicates persistent issues with contacting the Resource Manager and renewing the lease for a specific DFS client. These issues are likely caused by or exacerbated by the detected address changes. The system continues to attempt reconnections and lease renewals, but these efforts are unsuccessful during the observed period.
