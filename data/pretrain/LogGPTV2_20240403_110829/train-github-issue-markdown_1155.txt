##### Description of the problem
When using BasisTextureLoaded with a ShaderPass, the texture will only be used
properly if the uniform value is set after the instantiation of the
ShaderPass.

Without this line, the texture2D( tTexture, vUv) will be return vec4( 0., 0.,
0., 0. )
I couldn't create a fiddle.  
I don't know it it's due to webworkers or to webassembly, or some path issues,
but it was a mess.  
So I created a github repository.
