User:  A web application needs to be load balanced to improve system availability and performance. Please provide a solution that can satisfy web application load balancing.
Assistant: One solution that can satisfy load balancing for web applications is to use a load balancer. A load balancer can distribute traffic from users to multiple web servers, thereby balancing the load on each server. In addition, the load balancer can also monitor the health status of the server. If a server fails, the load balancer can automatically distribute the traffic to other normal servers and prevent access from being affected. Common load balancers include hardware load balancers and software load balancers, which can be selected according to actual needs.
