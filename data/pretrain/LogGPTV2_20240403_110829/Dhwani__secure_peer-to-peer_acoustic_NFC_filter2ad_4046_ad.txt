7. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
Figure 10 shows the overall architecture of Dhwani.
Transmitter Overview. As seen in Figure 10, at the transmitter,
the message is ﬁrst scrambled to ensure that bit errors result in the
entire message being corrupted at the receiver. As discussed in
Section 3, this is important in order to ensure that the eavesdropper
cannot beneﬁt from extracting parts of the message that are error
free. The OFDM radio (described in Section 5) then transmits the
scrambled message over the air using the speaker. The jamming de-
tector continuously monitors the ambient jamming level to ensure
that there is “enough” jamming to prevent any eavesdropper from
receiving the message. Upon detecting a drop in jamming levels
below a “safe” threshold, it simply directs the OFDM transmitter
to abort the transmission mid-way.
Receiver Overview. As depicted in Figure 10, the received sig-
nal ﬁrst passes through the JamSecure module. The JamSecure
module transmits the jamming signal over the speakers, while si-
multaneously performing SIC on the received signal, as described
in Section 6. An additional function that the JamSecure module
performs is to estimate the appropriate jamming power needed to
simultaneously ensure that (a) an eavesdropper cannot decode the
message, (b) the receiver, with the beneﬁt of SIC, can decode the
message, and (c) a concurrent transaction at a distance of 1.5m or
greater is not interfered with. Requirement (c) just imposes an up-
per bound on the jamming power, as discussed in Section 4.3. This
then leaves the task of balancing requirements (a) and (b). The es-
timation of jamming power for this purpose is performed with the
help of the transmitter, as described in Section 7.2. The OFDM
receiver then decodes the message, after which the descrambler re-
trieves the original message. Successful reception of a packet is
indicated by a 24-bit CRC check.
In the rest of this section we shall describe two key compo-
nents of the system that have not been described so far: the scram-
bler/descrambler and the jamming power estimator.
As noted in Section 3.5, Dhwani uses scrambling prior to encod-
ing and modulation, to amplify the impact of bit errors, thereby ren-
dering the received (scrambled) message unreadable and prevent-
ing any information leakage. While a special-purpose scrambler
could be designed, we simply re-purpose the widely-available and
highly-efﬁcient Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) [3] scheme.
Whereas AES is typically used for encryption, with a private key
that is kept secret, we use it with a well-known key, since our ob-
jective is to achieve the desired error propagation, not secrecy. The
block-size in AES equals the key length — 128, 192, or 256 bits
— which allows the possibility of sending a short NFC message
(with padding) as a separately encrypted block or longer messages
as multiple blocks. When the receiver, with the beneﬁt of SIC, re-
trieves an error-free copy of the scrambled message, it is able to
unscramble it with the well-known key. However, an eavesdropper,
who typically suffers several bits of error will be unable to decode
the message, even knowing the key.
7.2 Jamming Power Estimator
As described in Section 3, the message success rate at the re-
ceiver experiences a precipitous drop when the SNR falls below
a certain threshold, SN Rmin. For most modulation schemes this
threshold can be determined experimentally. The jammer in Jam-
Secure should ensure the following,

rors, and

Dealing with Synchronization Errors. Sampling offset correction
only corrects sub-sample synchronization errors. However, in or-
der to cancel perfectly, the receiver must know the exact sample at
which it started receiving the jamming sequence. Each jamming se-
quence is preceded by a chirp preamble (as described in Section 5)
that helps the receiver synchronize itself to the jamming sequence.
This method, however, by itself sometimes results in errors of up
to a few samples. To exactly determine the offset, we compare the
received PN signal at a few different sampling offsets with the pre-
computed JamP N J
recv,∆t for various values of ∆t, to correctly
identify both the start of PN sequence and the sampling offset.
Dealing with Multi-path. For dealing with multi-path, Dhwani
takes the channel estimation based approach, but with input signal
recv,∆topt of the re-
as the optimal delay-shifted version JamP N J
ceived signal rather than the transmitted sequence. Working with
the received signal greatly simpliﬁes the channel estimation since
most of the channel effects due to the electro-mechanical compo-
nents of the speaker and microphone are already compensated for.
Thus, Dhwani uses the ﬁrst few samples of the (known) PN se-
quence received (512 in our implementation) and computes a FIR
ﬁlter H(t) that can transform JamP N J
recv,∆topt (m) (which only
factors in the transformation due to static factors such as the speaker
and microphone) into the actual received samples (which is also im-
pacted by the dynamic multi-path environment). It then applies this
ﬁlter to the rest of the JamP N J
recv,∆topt, to transform it suitably,
and then subtract it from rest of the received jamming signal.
70Figure 10: Dhwani System Overall
• after SIC, the SNR is sufﬁcient to decode the packet.
In other words, the jammer should guarantee that the SNR of the
eavesdropper is below SN Rmin, while the same for the receiver is
greater than the SN Rmin.
While, in our experiments we do not see a signiﬁcant variation
in the amount of cancellation achieved by SIC from location to lo-
cation (as reported in Section 9), in general it may be inﬂuenced
by the environment. To safeguard against a scenario where SIC
may not perform as well as intended, for every transmission the
amount of available SIC must be estimated. Further, since the re-
ceived power levels of the transmission can vary across transmis-
sions, this should also be estimated for each transmission. In order
to accomplish this, a Dhwani transaction starts by the transmitter
transmitting some known bits to the receiver (also the jammer). The
jamming power estimator (in the receiver) uses this transmission to
determine the transmit power Pxmit in dB of the sender3. Soon af-
ter this, the jammer begins transmitting its own PN sequence, per-
forms SIC and determines the amount of cancellation ICdB that it
can obtain. Based on its estimates of IC, Pxmit and SN Rmin, the
receiver then determines the PJam using the relation:
Pjam = Pxmit − SN Rmin + IC.
(7)
As seen from Figure 11, Pxmit − SN RmindB is the maximum
noise that the receiver can tolerate after SIC. Hence, JamSecure
can afford to jam at a power Pxmit − SN Rmin + IC. The eaves-
dropper will experience a SNR of SN Rmin − IC. Consequently,
as see from Figure 2 in Section 3, IC > 5dB will ensure that the
eavesdropper cannot receive the packet since message success rate
will drop to almost 0%.
One interesting issue arises when Pxmit is so low that Pxmit
− SN RmindB is below the noise ﬂoor of the receiver.
In this
case, Dhwani’s receiver itself is incapable of receiving this packet.
Further, jamming below noise ﬂoor of the receiver is not meaning-
ful. The eavesdropper however, can potentially have an ultra-low
noise receiver that might have an SNR advantage and could still de-
code the packet. In this scenario, Dhwani simply jams with a high
power, making sure that even the eavesdropper is unable to decode
the packet successfully.

8.1 Information-Theoretic Security in Dhwani
The classical information-theoretic approach to security is Shan-
non’s one-time pad (OTP) encryption [20]. Suppose device A needs
to communicate a message M to device B securely in the presence
of an eavesdropper E who can see all messages. Then, A and B ﬁrst
share a secret random string ω, of length equal to that of M, over
an independent channel not accessible to E. This, ω, is one-time
pad, i.e. it can be only used once and cannot be reused for any sub-
sequent message. A then transmits the message M(cid:48) = M ⊕ω to B.
Knowing ω, B can extract M from M(cid:48). This approach is provably
guaranteed to be secure.
Wyner’s wiretap model. Given the obvious difﬁculties in Shan-
non’s approach of setting up a shared secret between A and B, over
an alternate channel, for every message, Wyner’s wiretap model [21]
takes a different approach, depicted in Figure 12. In this model, A
and B communicate over a channel ChAB that is less noisy than
the channel ChAE via which E eavesdrops. The key proven re-
sult in the Wyner’s wire-tap model is that, if ChAE is even slightly
more noisy than ChAB, there exists an error correcting mechanism
(e.g., error correcting codes) that A can use over ChAB that will
appear identical to noise for E but can be perfectly decoded at B.
The channel that E listens on is called a Wyner’s wiretap channel.
Dhwani’s approach. Dhwani’s approach falls primarily under the
purview of Wyner’s wiretap model, since the channel to the eaves-
dropper is noisier than that of the intended receiver due to jam-
ming coupled with self-interference-cancellation. Consequently,
the transmitter can use an error correcting mechanism (e.g., er-
ror correcting codes) that is sufﬁcient for correcting errors in the
less noisy channel, ChAB, but not so for the more noisy channel,
ChAE, for the eavesdropper.
Further, since the jamming sequence is generated pseudo-randomly
for each transaction and never reused, it can be viewed as a random
string for one-time-pad encryption 4. However, unlike Shannon’s
OTP, Dhwani does not apply the OTP encryption at the transmitter
itself and may be vulnerable to certain attacks such as those based
on shielding and directional antennas, which undermine the Wyner
wiretap assumption.
8.2 Security Attacks on Dhwani
8. SECURITY ANALYSIS
In general, there are two approaches to achieving secure commu-
nication: information-theoretic and cryptographic. The information-
theoretic approach is based on Shannon’s information theory (as
we elaborate on in this section), while the cryptographic approach
(e.g., RSA) relies on the computational hardness of problems such
as prime factorization. Our approach to security in Dhwani is infor-
mation theoretic but in no way precludes the use of cryptographic
techniques, which can always be implemented over and above Dhwani.
3Note that Pxmit is really the sender’s power received at the jam-
mer.
As noted in Section 3.1, Dhwani seeks to defend against both
passive and active attacks on a pair of proximate, communicating
nodes, which are assumed to be trustworthy. In this section, we
discuss various security attacks on Dhwani, assuming that node A
intends to transmit a message M securely to B, while C is a mali-
cious node.
Man-in-the-middle and replay attacks. When A transmits M to
B, a co-located eavesdropper E can receive it and try to transmit a
4While Shannon’s OTP encryption and Wyner’s wire-tap model
analyse the security of binary channels, these results hold even for
analogue signals since they can be translated into corresponding
binary message through demodulation.

modiﬁed (or unmodiﬁed) version to someone else, pretending to be
A. However, since E has no way of receiving any meaningful data,
given the jamming from B, these attacks will remain ineffective.
DOS attacks A co-located device E could transmit its own jam-
ming signal, to disallow meaningful communication between A and
B. While E may succeed in disrupting communication between A
and B, there will be no loss of security since E cannot recover the
data transmitted by A.
Placement attacks. This attack is based on the presumption that
there might be vantage points where B’s jamming is not as effective
and so E could recover A’s transmission. Consider three devices a
sender A, a receiver B and an eavesdropper E located as depicted
in Figure 18. Suppose that the distance between A and B is d and
that between A and E is D. The received acoustic power typically
decays with distance x as x−γ, where γ > 2. The SNR at the
eavesdropper is thus given by,

uses a highly directional microphone (say using an microphone ar-
ray formed by a coordinated set of attacker nodes) that is aimed
at the speaker of A to boost the signal from A relative to the jam-
ming noise from B, or alternatively, uses physical shielding aimed
at B to reduce its jamming noise relative to the signal from A. The
net effect in either case is an improvement in the signal-to-noise
ratio, increasing E’s chances of decoding A’s transmission despite
the jamming by B. While such attacks are possible in theory, these
would be extremely difﬁcult to mount in practice because of the
close proximity of A and B, with the typical separation between
them being a few cm. For example, the attacker has to be able
to focus the directional microphone (or beamform) into a narrow
region of only a few cm in order to selectively avoid the jammer.
Also, since sound travels freely around obstacles, it is not feasible
to selectively shield the jamming noise emanating from B, short
of placing the shield right next to B (cloaking B’s speaker), which
again is hard to do undetected.

where J is the jammer’s power and S the sender’s power at a unit
distance. From Eqn 8 is is clear that SNR decreases monotoni-
cally with increasing D for any given θ and in fact the maximum
SNR occurs at D = 0. Thus, the most advantageous position
for the eavesdropper is to be co-located with the sender. As de-
scribed in Section 7, the sender transmits only upon ensuring there
is enough jamming to ensure that it cannot decode its own trans-
mission. Since no eavesdropper can enjoy at better SNR than the
sender, it follows that an eavesdropper cannot decode the message
either.
In the above argument, we do not consider the effects of multi-
path and near-ﬁeld acoustic power decay. For instance, in theory,
it is possible that at certain locations, the jamming signals arriving
along multiple paths may all interfere destructively. At such loca-
tions, the eavesdropper might enjoy an SNR high enough to enable
decoding. While it is hard to claim that such scenarios will never
occur, in our tests we could not ﬁnd any such vantage points, as
discussed in Section 9.5.

as it disables B, E can start emitting its own jamming signal, to
