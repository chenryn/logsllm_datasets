User: I have a simple python webserver but I want to use the CGI script  for file download and upload  according to  client-request .But I couldnt find the any way of adjusting the CGI except using apache2 ,nginx or etc...  Is there any way to adjust cgi script to my python webserver  with Bash script or with other way ? Can you give me any advice about it?
Assistant: Why are you not try to pass the address/location of your file which you want to download as a argument to the class and then use that in the < a href> tag to convert that into the link and implement the download functionality
