On: `Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.134]`
I have implemented conpty in my terminal emulator:  
https://github.com/wez/wezterm
I can successfully run `target\debug\wezterm.exe` to spawn console
applications such as `cmd.exe` `powershell.exe` and `bash`.
The issue I'm seeing is that when I launch bash, either indirectly via
`cmd.exe` or directly via the bash launcher, conpty seems to swallow the mouse
reporting escape sequences; I don't see them being received by my terminal
parser, and thus `vim` has no effective mouse support despite being configured
with `set mouse=a`.
Running the same WSL install via `wsl-terminal` does have working mouse
support, and `wezterm` has been my daily driver on Linux for about a year with
working mouse support, so we can rule out an obvious misconfiguration with
`vim` and the parser in `wezterm`.
I've also tried `echo -e "\e[?1000h"` to manually enable mouse reporting from
the shell; normally (on linux and via wsl-terminal) this causes clicks in the
terminal to send data to the shell (which appears as garbage input), but when
running my terminal with conpty, these are also swallowed up somewhere.
Is there something special needed for the apps that I spawn into my pty to be
able to work with the mouse?
In case you want to double check the key portion of the code, the relevant
file is:  
https://github.com/wez/wezterm/blob/master/src/winpty.rs  
The flow is to `CreatePipe` a pair of pipes, `CreatePseudoConsole`, and then
pass that to a spawned child via the threadproc attributes, as the samples in
the MSDN docs and this repo also do.
