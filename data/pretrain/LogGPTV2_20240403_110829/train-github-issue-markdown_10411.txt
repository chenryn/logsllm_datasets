### System Information
- **OpenCV Version:** 4.0.1
- **Operating System/Platform:** Windows 10 64-bit
- **Compiler:** Visual C++ 14.0

### Detailed Description
This is my first bug report. I encountered an issue while trying to use the following example code from the OpenCV documentation:
- [Text Detection Example](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.3/db/da4/samples_2dnn_2text_detection_8cpp-example.html)

The code did not work as expected on my computer, specifically when attempting to load images. The problematic section of the code is:

```cpp
if (parser.has("input"))
    cap.open(parser.get("input"));
else
    cap.open(0);

// ... other code ...

cap >> frame;
```

I found that replacing the above code with a simpler approach resolved the issue:

```cpp
frame = imread(parser.get("input"), cv::IMREAD_COLOR);
```

With this change, the image was successfully loaded, whereas the original `cap >> frame` command failed to do so.

### Steps to Reproduce
To resolve the issue, replace the following lines in the code:

```cpp
cap >> frame;
if (frame.empty())
{
    waitKey();
    break;
}
```

with:

```cpp
frame = imread(parser.get("input"), cv::IMREAD_COLOR);
```

This modification should ensure that the image is correctly loaded.
