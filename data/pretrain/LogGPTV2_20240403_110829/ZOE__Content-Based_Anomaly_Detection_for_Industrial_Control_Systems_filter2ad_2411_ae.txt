model to cluster sensor measurements. Urbina et al. [61] study
the physics-based detection of attacks in control systems and
develop an adaptive adversary model as well as a new metric
for measuring the impact of stealthy attacks.
VII. CONCLUSION
While the use of n-grams has been proven very effective
for content-based anomaly detection of text-based network
protocols [23, 65–67, 71], for binary-based protocols these
however are considered mostly impractical [23]. For industrial
environments and SCADA systems the research community
has thus moved towards alternative schemes, such as modelling
the appearance of network trafﬁc or the underlying physical
process.
In contrast to prior believe we show that content-based
anomaly detection very well is applicable to protocols with
high-entropy data. We observe that the frequency values of
features carry valuable information for modeling normality
and constructing detection models—especially for proprietary
binary protocol. The combination of learning message-type
speciﬁc prototype models and de-noising these enables effective
attack detection with particularly few false-positives.
In an extensive evaluation using 210 GiB of network trafﬁc
from two industrial facilities, we show that ZOE is able
to signiﬁcantly improve detection performance compared
to related approaches. As an example, our method detects
97.1 % of the attacks in our dataset with as few as 2 false-alarms
out of 100,000 messages, while Anagram only yields 16.5 %
with an 500× higher false-positive rate of 1 %. Moreover,
we study the inﬂuence of polymophic blending attacks on
our detector and show that ZOE’s de-noising functionality
effectively limits an attacker’s reach of play and improves the
resistance against this type of mutation attacks.
