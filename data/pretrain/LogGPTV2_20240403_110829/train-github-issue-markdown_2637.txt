**What happened** :  
Using `kubeadm init --config /path/to/config.yml` appears to block default
values from being set. I first noticed it where a pre-flight check of the
Servicer CIDR was presenting itself as an empty string although I had not set
it through the command line flag nor in the config file. I also noticed that
kubelet requests to the API server were being sent to port 0 as the API server
default port had not been set.
**What you expected to happen** :  
A config file should only override defaults, not make it so that no defaults
are set.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
Use `kubeadm init --config /path/to/config.yml` with an appropriate
configuration file that does not set the service CIDR, for example, and note
that pre-flight checks will fail due to the default values not being set.
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
A temporary workaround is to explicitly set all values to their defaults or
the value you desire.
