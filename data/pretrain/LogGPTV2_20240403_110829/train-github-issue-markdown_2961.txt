Right now, as I understand it, helpers registered to the PHP templating engine
aren't accesible in Twig, so any developer who writes a helper must duplicate
(or at least wrap) their helper to make it available to Twig templates. To me,
this seems like unnecessary work for the developer and it's bound to cause
trouble for some users switching from one templating engine to the other. Why
not simply have TwigBundle pass the PHP helpers to all twig templates?
