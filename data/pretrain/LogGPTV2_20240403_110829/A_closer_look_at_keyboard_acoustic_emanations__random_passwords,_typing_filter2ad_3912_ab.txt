The beneﬁt of using this technique is that it and ensures virtually
no overlap of keyboard acoustic sounds. It also enables typing each
letter using approximately the same force and hitting the keys from
the same angle, resulting in a relatively similar sound for multiple
clicks of the same key. Overall, this technique minimizes noise or
overlap sounds during the key press and maximized the contribu-
tion of the keys hitting the underlying plate. Since the plate acts
like a “drum”, it produces the emanated audio sound ([1]) related
to its position on the plate.
This technique can therefore be used to train the system by an
attacker (not the original typist) who is trying to extract audio em-
anations which are due to the physical structure of the keyboard.
We used the above technique to take ten signal recordings for
each key of the alphabet letters as our initial data.
Hunt and Peck Typing: In the second scenario, random pass-
words are typed using the hunt and peck style. This case differs
from the ﬁrst case since consecutive letters are different from each
other. This causes the ﬁnger to hit the key from possibly different
angles (depending on which key was typed earlier). For this test,
we chose to generate random passwords of 6-character each (since
the characters are chosen randomly, the data could be divided into
any password size). Since 6-character is still the minimum size of
password one can chose for many sites today, this still provides a
realistic scenario where the attacker has the highest probability of
guessing the password. We generated a total of 25 different such
random passwords, and each password was typed 3 times consecu-
tively. We refer to this data as the “Test Hunt and Peck data” in the
rest of the paper.
Touch Typing: In the third scenario, we type the same password
list – as in the Hunt and Peck case – using the touch typing tech-
nique. In this scenario, each key has its own designated ﬁnger and
the rest of the ﬁngers may possibly touch the keyboard while typ-
ing (depending on the hands’ movement). We recall that this typing
technique is very popular among users. However, this typing style
does affect the acoustic emanations as the keys are hit from differ-
ent angles, depending both on the ﬁnger used as well as the hand
position during the typing of each key (which depends on the pre-
vious letters typed). We refer to this data as the “Test Touch Typing
data”.
4.2 Typing Style and Signal Correlation
To measure the effect of typing style on signal similarity, we
examine the maximum correlation between instances of the keys in
the test data with each Letter Data Set of the training data.
Our training data included 10 training samples using the straw
man typed dataset (Section 4.1).
Straw Man Typing: We started by using the aforementioned data
as test data itself. For each sample, we calculate the maximum
correlation with each of the other instances taken with the same key
(termed matching key). We then calculate the mean of these values.
We did this for both the press and release part of the signal. We
mark these values as PcorrMatchPrs(i) and PcorrMatchRls(i)
for each sample i of the data.
We repeat this calculation for the sample with the Letter Data
Sets of the rest of the keys (termed non-matching keys). For each
tested sample, we take the highest value of the 25 values we re-
ceived, which shows the correlation to the most likely key to be
chosen as a match to the original sample. We mark this value
as PcorrNonMatchPress(i) and PcorrNonMatchRls(i) for each
sample i of the data.
At this point, we compare the correlations of the press and re-
lease samples. If the highest correlation for the sample belongs to
the Letter Data Set of the matching alphabet key, i.e.,
PcorrMatchPrs(i) > PcorrNonMatchPrs(i);
(1)
we mark the press part of the sample as a Match correlation. We
do the same for the release. We calculate the Match probability as
the number of keys found to Match (i.e., being best correlated to
the samples of the corresponding typed letter in the training data)
divided by the total number of samples. For the Straw Man Dataset,

we found that 56% of the press signals and 67% of the release
signals best matched their corresponding typed letter.
Hunt and Peck Typing: We next repeat the correlation calcula-
tions between the hunt and peck passwords test dataset and the
Straw Man initial dataset. We found that the Match probability
was reduced to 28% for the press and 43% for the release samples.
We therefore observe that the percentage of signals that are best
correlated to the training data belonging to the matching letter is
signiﬁcantly reduced. Therefore, when the typing style changed
slightly it becomes more likely to choose the wrong key as the best
matching key to the new sample.
Touch Typing: We further repeated the analysis for the data taken
with the touch typing style. We calculated the correlation between
these samples to the training data. In this case, we found that the
probability of each instance matching the correct letter in the train-
ing data was reduced to 13% for the press part of the signal, and
24% for the release.
A summary of the results is presented in Table 2. In conclusion,
we observed that the maximum correlation between instances of
the same key reduces when the typing style changes. On the other
hand, the correlation to instances taken with other keys increases
which makes it hard to detect correctly the key. This conﬁrms our
hypothesis that typing style has a strong effect on the similarity of
same key audio signals and the ability to distinguish them from
other keys.
5. PASSWORD DETECTION
Out of the ﬁve techniques explored in Section 3, we found that
the cross-correlation (X-Corr) and time-frequency classiﬁcation (Time-
Frq) techniques yielded higher accuracies. In this section, we in-
vestigate the advantage that an attacker can get by using these two
techniques to eavesdrop over random passwords.
We examine the performance of these techniques and compare
the detection rates for random passwords typed with both the hunt
and peck and the touch typing styles.
We start by examining the key detection rate for each of the data
groups. We utilize as training data ten instances of each alphabet
key which reduces the effect of noise (as opposed to four instances
used in Section 4.1).
We calculate the similarity measure – max correlation for cross-
correlation and ST F similarity for time-frequency classiﬁcation –
between each tested instance and each alphabet key letter in the
training data. For each technique, we chose as the best matching
letter the one with the highest similarity measurement.
5.1 Initial Dataset, Straw Man Approach
The initial data is typed with the Straw Man Approach (as dis-
cussed in section 4.1). Each instance in the dataset is utilized as a
test instance, with the rest of the dataset used as the training data
(excluding the test instance).
As a result, we found that the cross-correlation statistics calcu-
lated using this technique resulted in a 83% accuracy rate per key
(since we now use ten keys per training, this raised the result up
from 73% when only four training instances were used). When
using the time-frequency based classiﬁcation, we found that the

results further improved (to 89%). We conclude that when the typ-
ing is repetitive, the underlying physical characteristics of the key-
board has strong effect on the acoustic emanations and the ability
to eavesdrop is relatively high.
5.2 Test Data, Hunt and Peck Style
For this dataset, we calculate the similarity measures using the
initial data (straw man approach dataset) as our training data and
the hunt and peck dataset as our test dataset.
We ﬁnd that the cross-correlation performance is reduced to a
54% accuracy rate per key. We found that utilizing the time-frequency
technique improved the detection rate to 65% per character. We
conclude that the angle at which the ﬁnger hits the key affects the
acoustic signal emanated and reduces the detection accuracy com-
pared to typing the same key continuously.
5.3 Test Data, Touch Typing Style
We repeated the testing process for the passwords typed with
the touch typing style (using the straw man dataset as our train-
ing data). We ﬁnd that utilizing the cross-correlation technique for
key detection, the accuracy rate is reduced to 34%. For the time-
frequency based classiﬁcation, we observe that the rate of detection
per correct character has increased to 41%.
5.4 Best Guesses Search
To raise our detection rate, we tried to create a list of additional
keys to be checked against our recorded password. We imple-
mented this by creating a list of keys having the highest max cor-
relation and a list of keys with the lowest TF distance from the test
character. When examining the ordered list of highest matching al-
phabet letters, we saw that the probability of the key matching each
of the letters reduces signiﬁcantly after the ﬁfth letter.
We therefore implement a “Best Guesses Search” – in which
for each typed character, we create a list of the 5 best matching
keys. We then determine the probability of a correct detection for

the ﬁve keys. Using the correlation-based technique, we found that
the probability of each character to be in the list of the top ﬁve
keys increased to 79% for the hunt and peck data. For the touch
typing data, in contrast, the probability that the key is in the ﬁrst
ﬁve choices was found to be 64%.
For the time-frequency based classiﬁcation, we found that the
probability of each character to be in the list of the top 5 keys in-
creased to 88%. For the touch typing data, the rate increased to
75%. Our Results (for single key and ﬁve key guesses) are summa-
rized in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The results corresponding to
the two best guesses are depicted in Table 6 of the appendix. (see
Appendix).
5.5 Training, Touch Typing Style
We now examine the case where the training is also performed
using continuous typed characters.
In this scenario, the attacker
ﬁrst eavesdrops over a user typing continuous text. He records the
text and uses language model tools to detect the keys pressed. Then,
