User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Setting up Apache VirtualHost for multiple sites I'm trying to set up a website on my machine, and am having some trouble. I've prototyped the website using Flask and the debug server, and now would like to host it for a bit while I further debug it. This is only for internal use within my company network.

I cannot seem to get Apache configured correctly. I currently run a default site that links to my home directory, so I can grab files from other machines through a web browser. 

I haven't changed my apache2.conf at all, but here's my httpd.conf

&lt;Location /server-status&gt;
    SetHandler server-status

    Order Deny, Allow
    Deny from all
    Allow from .mycompany.com
&lt;/Location&gt;


My default config, located within /etc/apache2/sites-available/default, has

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin polkid@mycompany.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www
    &lt;Directory /&gt;
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;Directory /var/www/&gt;
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinksMultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from .mycompany.com
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
    &lt;Directory /var/www/home/&gt;
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOVerride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from .mycompany.com
    &lt;/Directory&gt;

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

    LogLevel warn

    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


While the app I'm trying to enable has the following config file, located at /etc/apache2/sites-available/Powermon

LoadModule fastcgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_fastcgi.so

User p_user
Group p_group
FastCgiServer /home/p_user/Powermon/runp.fcgi -idle-timeout 300 -processes 5

&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName powermon
    DocumentRoot /home/p_user/Powermon/app/static
    Alias /static /home/p_user/Powermon/app/static

    AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi
    ScriptAlias / /home/p_user/Powermon/runp.fcgi

    ErrorLog /home/p_user/Powermon/logs/powermon_error_log

    &lt;Location /&gt;
        SetHandler fastcgi-script
    &lt;/Location&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


Within sites-enabled I saw 

000-default -&gt; ../sites-available/default


So I added

010-powermon -&gt; ../sites-available/Powermon


And when I run apache2ctl -S I see

VirtualHost configuration:
wildcard NameVirtualHosts and _default_servers:
*:80            is a NameVirtualHost
    default server dhcp-ip-address.mycompany.com (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:1)
    port 80 namevhost dhcp-ip-address.mycompany.com (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default:1)
    port 80 namevhost powermon (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/010-powermon:7)
Syntax OK


So currently when I go to machine-name/ in a browser, I can navigate my home directory and look at files as needed. Ideally I want to be able to go to machine-name/powermon and see my app running.

Assistant: You say you want to setup Apache virtual hosts, but then you say this:

A path on a host is not a virtual host.  Your config is set as follows:  Traffic to powermon goes to one config.  Traffic to dhcp-ip-address.mycompany.com goes to another config.

So the only way that an Apache virtual host setup would work is you go to this URL and get one thing:

dhcp-ip-address.mycompany.com


Then go to this URL &amp; get another thing:

powermon


The only way to really achieve this via Apache virtual host setup is to alter your web browsing client’s /etc/hosts file like this. Let’s assume these virtual hosts are on a server with the IP address 123.456.78.90.  Open up your hosts file—I am on a Mac so this is how I would do it—via nano like this:

sudo nano /etc/hosts


And add this line to the bottom of the file:

123.456.78.90 powermon


Now when you point your web browser to:

http://powermon


You will get the Apache virtual host setup you have in place.

But again, you are mixing up the concept of a server path with a server virtual host. So you need to iron that out before you do anything else. Also, your virtual host config for powermon seems disjointed. The items outside of &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; should go inside. Otherwise those config options just get used by the server-wide default config anyway. And the User &amp; Group settings seem kludgy as well. The scripts should be set to be usable by the Apache user &amp; group. Not the other way around.  But assuming good faith, this is how I would structure it:

User p_user
   Group p_group


        ServerName powermon
        DocumentRoot /home/p_user/Powermon/app/static
        Alias /static /home/p_user/Powermon/app/static

    LoadModule fastcgi_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_fastcgi.so

    FastCgiServer /home/p_user/Powermon/runp.fcgi -idle-timeout 300 -processes 5

    AddHandler fastcgi-script fcgi
    ScriptAlias / /home/p_user/Powermon/runp.fcgi

    ErrorLog /home/p_user/Powermon/logs/powermon_error_log

    &lt;Location /&gt;
        SetHandler fastcgi-script
    &lt;/Location&gt;

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
