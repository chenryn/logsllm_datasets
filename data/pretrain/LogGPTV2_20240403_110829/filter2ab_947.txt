### Title: Behind the Speculative Curtain: The True Story of Fighting Meltdown and Spectre at Black Hat US 2018

**January 2, 2018.** Your phone buzzes. For over six months, you and a coalition of companies have been working tirelessly to combat a new class of hardware vulnerabilities. You had planned for seven more days before the public disclosure, but the incoming text message informs you that there has been a leak, and the deadline is now less than 24 hours away. You are not readyâ€”what do you do?

For months before the public became aware of the challenges posed by speculative execution, security experts from hardware, platform, cloud, and service providers were collaborating around the clock to develop mitigations and coordinate a response to protect the billions of users relying on their platforms. This is the behind-the-scenes story of those intense months, as seen through the eyes of Apple, Google, and Microsoft. During this period, competitors turned into partners, and an unprecedented level of information was shared.

While much has been written about multi-party coordinated responses, it's time to rethink our approach. We need a new playbook. In this panel, you will hear previously undisclosed details about the response efforts and gain valuable insights into what worked and what didn't in one of the most complex and far-reaching vulnerability disclosures in recent memory. The tech industry is increasingly interdependent, and the Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities serve as a wake-up call on multiple fronts: how we engineer, how we partner, and how we respond when new security issues arise. While this panel won't provide all the answers, it will be a crucial starting point.
