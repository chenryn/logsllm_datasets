User: How to adjust the Linux kernel parameters to improve the performance and stability of the system?
Assistant: To adjust Linux kernel parameters to improve system performance and stability, you can follow the steps below: 1. Understand the /proc/sys directory: /proc/sys is a virtual file system that contains a large number of parameters that can be modified when the Linux kernel is running. 2. Determine the parameters that need to be modified: You can use the sysctl command to view the value of the current kernel parameters and determine the parameters that need to be modified. 3. Modify parameters: There are two ways to modify kernel parameters, one is to directly modify kernel parameter values in the /proc/sys directory (temporary effect); the other is to add kernel parameters in the /etc/sysctl.conf file , so that it will take effect automatically after the system restarts. 4. Reload kernel parameters: You can use the sysctl -p command to reload all parameters in the /proc/sys directory, or use the sysctl -w command to reload a specific parameter. Common kernel parameters that can be optimized include: 1. File system-related parameters, such as fs.file-max, fs.nr_open, etc., can affect the file processing performance of the system; 2. Network-related parameters, such as net.core.somaxconn , net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies, etc., can affect the network communication performance of the system; 3. Memory-related parameters, such as vm.swappiness, vm.max_map_count, etc., can affect the memory management performance of the system; 4. Process scheduling-related parameters, such as kernel.sched_min_granularity_ns, kernel.sched_wakeup_granularity_ns, etc., can affect the process scheduling performance of the system. Note that you need to be cautious when modifying kernel parameters, especially some key parameters. Improper modification may cause the system to crash or become unstable. It is recommended to back up the /etc/sysctl.conf file before modifying it so that it can be restored if needed.
