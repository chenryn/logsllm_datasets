### UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry

#### Introduction
This inquiry delves into the historical relationship between unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and government agencies, focusing on the United States. It aims to provide a clear, coherent, and professional account of the key events, documents, and individuals involved in this complex and often controversial subject.

#### Defining UFOs
- **What a UFO is not**: Before discussing what UFOs are, it is essential to clarify what they are not. UFOs are not necessarily extraterrestrial spacecraft; they are simply objects in the sky that cannot be readily identified.
- **What a UFO is**: UFOs are aerial phenomena that remain unexplained after initial observation and analysis. These can include natural, man-made, or potentially unknown sources.

#### The Modern Era of UFOs
The modern era of UFOs began in the 1940s, with reports of "foo fighters" over Germany and Japan in 1944. Military pilots reported observing strange, disc-shaped objects during World War II.

**Key Document:**
- **Date**: September 25, 1947
- **From**: Lt. General Nathan Twining
- **To**: Commanding General of the Army Air Forces, Brig. General George Schulgen
- **Subject**: Air Materiel Command Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs"

**Summary of the Report:**
- The phenomenon is real and not visionary or fictitious.
- The objects are approximately disc-shaped and large enough to be compared to man-made aircraft.
- They exhibit extreme rates of climb, maneuverability, and evasive actions when sighted by friendly aircraft and radar.

#### Congressional Inquiries
Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson inquired about the discs and was informed:
- "The Army Air Force is conducting an investigation of the alleged 'flying discs.' Detailed statements of credible witnesses are being carefully reviewed."

#### US Air Force Projects
- **PROJECT SIGN (1948)**: Three hypotheses were consideredâ€”Russian, American, and extraterrestrial. The first two were rejected, but the extraterrestrial hypothesis was also ultimately dismissed.
- **PROJECT GRUDGE (1949)**: Press releases followed a policy of downplaying the significance of UFO sightings: "We have investigated and evaluated ________ and have found nothing of value which would change our previous estimates on this subject."

#### Dissatisfaction and Further Action
- **General Charles Cabell**: Chief of AF Intelligence, expressed frustration with the lack of serious effort and transparency: "What do I have to do to stir up action? Anyone can see that we do not have a satisfactory answer to the saucer question....I want the answer to the saucers and I want a good answer."

#### Notable Incidents
- **June 1952**: Orders were issued to fire on a UFO. Multiple radar units detected an object at 18,000 feet, which remained stationary for 30 minutes before moving at over 1,000 mph. F-94 jet fighters were scrambled, and anti-aircraft guns were loaded.
- **July 1952**: Washington D.C. saw multiple radar and visual sightings. Major General John Samford, Chief of AF Intelligence, stated: "Credible people have seen incredible things."

#### Project Blue Book
- **Creation**: The USAF created Project Blue Book, with Dr. J. Allen Hynek as the resource scientist.
- **CIA Involvement**: The CIA concluded that flying saucers were not a threat to national security, but the reports of them were. They recommended training military personnel in proper observation and creating programs to debunk UFOs to the public.

#### Dr. J. Allen Hynek and CUFOS
Dr. Hynek, disillusioned with the USAF's approach, founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) as an independent organization. He noted:
- "The public was, in fact, placed in the role of 'the enemy,' against whom 'counterespionage' tactics must be employed. From my personal experience, I frequently felt that those in charge did consider people who reported UFOs or who took a serious interest in them and wanted information about them, as enemies."

#### Disinformation and Deception
- **Three Legs of the Stool**: Illusion, Misdirection, and Ridicule, with ridicule being the most potent tool.

#### Significant Cases
- **RB-47 Event**: An RB-47 bomber was paced for hours by a UFO, confirmed by aircraft, ground radar, and visual observations. The Project Blue Book file on this case has never been found.
- **NICAP (1960s)**: Headed by former CIA director Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, NICAP advocated for further investigation of UFOs, stating they were guided by intelligence, not Russian, and not properly investigated.
- **Condon Committee (1969)**: The Colorado Project concluded that the USAF should stop investigating UFOs, despite numerous "unknowns." Project Blue Book was closed, and the USAF stopped responding to public inquiries.

#### Recent Developments
- **Interesting Cases**: Numerous well-documented cases continued to emerge, such as the Minot AFB incident in 1968, the Loring AFB sighting in 1975, the Tehran Iran event in 1976, and the Alaska incident in 1986.
- **2013 Publication**: "UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry" was recommended for inclusion in university libraries due to its comprehensive and objective approach, containing nearly 1,000 citations in almost 600 pages.

#### Conclusion
The history of UFOs and government involvement is marked by a mix of serious investigations, disinformation, and ongoing public interest. While no definitive conclusions about the origins of UFOs have been reached, the evidence suggests that there is more to the story than has been publicly acknowledged.
