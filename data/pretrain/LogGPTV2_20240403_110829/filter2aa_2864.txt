UFOs and Government: 
A Historical Inquiry
What a UFO is not.
What a UFO ... is.
The modern era of UFOs begins in the 1940s. 
It begins with "foo fighters" over Germany and 
Japan in 1944. 
Military pilots reported objects like these:
Date: September 25, 1947 
 From: Lt. General Nathan Twining  
To: Commanding General of the Army Air Forces; Brig. General George Schulgen 
Subject: Air Materiel Command Opinion Concerning "Flying Discs" 
 ... It is the opinion that: 
 a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary or fictitious. 
 b. There are objects probably approximating the shape of a disc. Of such appreciable size as 
to appear to be as large as man-made aircraft. 
 c. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of climb, maneuverability, and 
action which must be considered evasive when sighted by friendly aircraft and radar ..." 
Congressman Lyndon B. Johnson inquired about the discs and was 
told: 
"The Army Air Force is conducting an investigation of the alleged 
'flying discs.' Detailed statements of credible witnesses are being 
carefully reviewed." 
Which they were. 
The US Air Force responds with PROJECT SIGN in 1948. Three 
hypotheses are considered (Russian? American? 
Extraterrestrial?) and the first two are rejected. 
That hypothesis is rejected at the top and knocked back down. 
But  UFO reports don't stop and the USAF tries again - with 
PROJECT GRUDGE IN 1949. 
Press releases will conform to the following policy: 
""We have investigated and evaluated ________ and have found 
nothing of value which would change our previous estimates on 
this subject." 
Some become unhappy with the lack of a  
serious effort and forthrightness, e.g. 
Chief of AF Intelligence General Charles Cabell 
who said to Pentagon officers:  
"What do I have to do to stir up action? Anyone 
can see that we do not have a satisfactory 
answer to the saucer question....I want the 
answer to the saucers and I want a good 
answer." 
•June 1952. Orders are issued to fire ... on a mirage? on a 
hallucination?  
• "At a distance of 130 miles to the northeast of Washington 
DC, three different Army radar units detected an object at 
18,000 feet. The object's signal was strong, it remained 
stationary on radar for 30 minutes and then began to move. 
By the time it reached the edge of our scopes it was 
traveling over 1000 mph. 
• "Our report went all the way to the Pentagon and the order 
came back that if another one came in then we were to fire 
on it. After that first night, we loaded our 99mm anti-aircraft 
guns which was an unusual thing to do in a populated area. 
We also scrambled F-94 jet fighters from McGuire AFB."
July 1952. Washington D. C. Washington 
National Airport and Andrews AFB pick up 
unknown objects on radar. Ground observers 
see them. F-94s are scrambled and pilots see 
them too. 
At a press conference, Major General John 
Samford, Chief of AF Intelligence, states: 
"Credible people have seen incredible things." 
and the Washington Post reported ...
 July 28, 1952, headline of the Washington Post: 
Project Blue Book  
The USAF creates Project Blue Book with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, 
Northwestern University astronomer, as resource scientist. 
 The CIA gets involved and concludes a study: 
 - Flying saucers are not a threat to national security but 
reports of flying saucers are. 
- Military personnel should be trained in proper observation 
of flying saucers. 
Programs should be created to debunk flying saucers to the 
citizenry.
Fast forward to Hynek when he created CUFOS (The 
Center for UFO Studies) as an independent organization 
because he became disillusioned with the USAF: 
 "The public was, in fact, placed in the role of 'the 
enemy,' against whom 'counterespionage' tactics must 
be employed. From my personal experience, I 
frequently felt that those in charge did consider people 
who reported UFOs or who took a serious interest in 
them and wanted information about them, as 
enemies." (UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry, 
p. 243) 
•Three legs of the stool of disinformation and 
deception: 
•
ILLUSION 
•MISDIRECTION 
•RIDICULE 
•but the greatest of these is ridicule.
As military personnel were trained and the public "managed," 
sensor data was collected from a significant number of sightings.  
Speaking of extraordinary speeds and maneuvers by UFOs, Dr. 
Hermann Oberth, von Braun's mentor in rocket technology, wrote, 
"The accuracy of such measurements has not been doubted. If 
there would be only 3 or 4 measurements, I would not rely on 
them .... but there is existing more than 50 such measurements 
the wireless sets (radar) of the American Air Force and Navy, 
which are used in all fighters, cannot be so inaccurate that the 
information obtained with them can be doubted completely." - 
from his lecture notes for a talk given in Germany, "UFOs and 
Government: A Historical Inquiry," pp. 274-5. 
During the 1950s Project Blue Book debunked 
cases, often using impossible explanations. 
One particularly interesting case was the well-
documented RB-47 event. 
An RB-47 bomber was paced for hours by a 
UFO. Aircraft and ground radar as well as visual 
observation confirmed the event. The RB-47 
received radar transmissions from the unknown 
on its own radar frequency. The Project Blue 
Book file on this case has never been found. 
In the 1960s, NICAP was created, headed by former 
CIA director Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter who said 
in May 1960: 
•UFOs are guided by intelligence. 
•They are not Russian. 
•We have not properly investigated them. 
•Congress should investigate UFOs. 
Congressional investigation was squashed by the 
USAF.
In the 1970s, numerous events compelled the 
USAF to commission a university to investigate. 
In 1969 the Colorado Project - the Condon 
Committee - concluded - despite its own 
"unknowns" and hundreds of pages of 
discussion - that the AF should stop 
investigating UFOs. The USAF closed Blue 
Book and stopped responding to public 
inquiries. Subsequent AF investigations have, c, 
leaked through FOIAs.  
And Hynek founded CUFOS in protest.
Interesting cases did not go away. 
•24 Oct 1968 - Minot AFB - a thoroughly documented account of 
a remarkable incident - www.minoitb52ufo.com - earlier case 
but worth reading. 
•Oct 1975 - Loring AFB - FOIA elicited 24 documents describing 
a B-52 bomber crew on the ground observing an object 300 
feet away and five feet above the ground. 
•Sept 1976 - Tehran Iran - a DIA FOIA response details a "dog 
fight" between fighters and a UFO. An Iranian General later 
goes public at a Washington press conference, confirming this 
event. The DIA report says the case is of the highest credibility. 
•Nov 1986 - Alaska - the FAA release documents after FOIA 
about a radar and visual case.
2013: "UFOs and Government: A Historical 
Inquiry" is recommended for inclusion in 
university libraries because it stands out as an  
"EXCEPTION" to other work in the field. 
Nearly 1000 citations in almost 600 pages 
illuminates the history of the government's 
response, with minimal speculation, no 
conclusions about aliens and origins, but ... 
if you see the nose of a camel inside the tent, 
do you think there might be ... a camel?
