User: I have some python modules to copy into my Linux computer.
I found out that I need to copy them into one of the directory that python searches or else show a new path for it.

   how do I make it.
2. Also do tell me how do I add a new search path ?

please guide me in detail. I have very less knowledge in linux
Also please tell me how do I get over this kind of problems myself. Is there any small book or a kind of to learn?
Assistant: Make it a proper Python package on top of setuptools and register your command-line frontends using the 'console_scripts' entry-point.
