warding policy via network-wide abstractions such as SNAP [14],
NetKAT [13, 31], Magellan [41], NetCore [33], and Frenetic [19]. In
terms of the programming model, SNAP’s one-big-switch (OBS) ab-
straction [14] is the most relevant to Lyra; however, the OBS model
cannot explicitly specify the fine-grained scope, e.g., a specific set
of switches. P4Runtime [10] offers control plane-level APIs for P4
programs, rather than a compiler generating ASIC code. In general,
the state-of-the-art programming models in SDN aim to generate
the forwarding rules, which have different goals from Lyra.
Programmable ASIC compilers. The state-of-the-art efforts in
programmable ASIC compilers focus on compilation for individual
devices. 𝜇P4 [39] also targets portability and composition problems;
different from Lyra, however, 𝜇P4 only supports P4-family program-
ming, and does not target data plane programming across multiple
switches. Jose et al. [26] compiles P4 programs to architectures
such as the RMT and FlexPipe. Domino [37] builds upon the Banzai
machine model that supports stateful packet processing, supporting
a much wider class of data plane algorithms. Chipmunk [20, 21]
leverages slicing, a domain-specific synthesis technique, to optimize
Domino in compilation time and resource usage. Different from the
state of the arts, Lyra offers a new, chip detail-orthogonal language,
generates chip-specific code (like NPL and P4), and supports data
plane programming across multiple switches.
P4 synthesis for programmable NICs. Programmable NICs (e.g.,
Netcope [8], Netronome [9] , and Pensando [11]) support P4. Com-
pared with Lyra, there are two differences. First, Lyra takes as input
an OBP program and generates chip-specific programs for different
ASIC architectures. The P4 compilers for programmable NICs take
as input P4 programs and generate binary code. Second, Lyra can
generate code across a distributed setting consisting of multiple
programmable switches, but P4 NICs do not target such a goal.
We believe Lyra is potentially extendable to programmable NICs,
but this requires non-trivial extensions such as new NIC-function
synthesis algorithm and NIC-specific constraints encoding.
P4 Virtualization. P4 virtualization (e.g., Hyper4 [23], HyperV [42],
HyperVDP [43], and P4Visor [44]) offers a general-purpose P4 pro-
gram that can be dynamically configured to adopt behaviors equiv-
alent to other P4 programs. Different from Lyra, P4 virtualization
aims to mimic the target P4 program’s behavior by configuring
table entries for the underlying “hypervisor” program (e.g., hp4.p4
in Hyper4 [23]), rather than generating chip-specific code like Lyra.
10 CONCLUSION
Lyra is the first compiler that allows the network programmers to
program data plane while achieving portability, extensibility, and
composition. Lyra offers a one big pipeline programming model
for the programmers to conveniently express their data plane algo-
rithms, and then generates chip-specific code across multi-vendor
switches. Our evaluation results show that Lyra not only generates
runnable real-world programs (in both P4 and NPL), but also uses
fewer hardware resources than human-written programs.
This work does not raise any ethical issues.

A RESOURCE CONSTRAINT ENCODING
In this section, we detail more about how to encode the resource
constraints in the Reconfigurable Match Tables (RMT) architec-
ture [17]. For other ASIC architectures, e.g., Trident-4 and Silicon
One, the constraint encoding principle is the same.
SIGCOMM ’20, August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA
Gao et al.
A.1 Preliminary
Before detailing each type of resource encoding, we first describe
important preliminaries for the post usage.
Predicate block. Because RMT supports P4 [26], we first analyze
the whole Lyra program and synthesize the P4 program with meth-
ods introduced in §5.2.
The synthesizing algorithm returns a list of predicate blocks L𝑠
and the dependency relationship between the predicate blocks. As
we stated earlier, each predicate block is potentially deployed as a
table in the data plane: if any of the instructions 𝑖 that belongs to
the predicate block 𝐵 is deployed in the switch 𝑠, then the predicate
block should be in the switch. So we encode the validity 𝑉𝐵 of a
predicate block 𝐵 on switch 𝑠 as:
𝑉𝐵 =
𝑓𝑠(𝑖)
(4)
where I𝐵 denotes the instructions in predicate block 𝐵.
Header usage. We say a header is unused if no instruction de-
ployed in the switch reads or writes the fields in the header. The
header usage affects the resource occupation, thus we want to re-
move unused headers as much as possible. Similar to the predicate
block validity computation, the usage of one header ℎ on switch 𝑠
is encoded as:
𝑢ℎ =
𝑓𝑠(𝑖)
(5)

𝑖∈I𝐵

𝑖∈Iℎ
where Iℎ denotes the instructions that read or writes header ℎ. If a
header is unused, it does not necessarily mean the header takes no
resource in the switch, because we also need to take into account
the header dependency (see below).
Header validity. In the configurable parser, RMT doesn’t provide
any mechanism to skip header bytes. Thus we assume the packet is
parsed from the starting bit until the last valid header. This means if
a TCP header is parsed, then all the headers before the TCP header
(IPv4/IPv6, Ethernet) are also parsed. So we need to compute the
header dependency relationship based on the parser definition. For
two headers ℎ𝑖 and ℎ 𝑗, we say ℎ𝑖 depends on ℎ 𝑗 if in the parser graph
ℎ 𝑗 sits on one of the paths from the root to ℎ𝑖. For example, the
TCP header depends on the Ethernet header, but does not depend
on the UDP header. Here, ℎ𝑖 depends on ℎ 𝑗 means if ℎ𝑖 is parsed,
then ℎ 𝑗 must also be parsed.
So the validity of a header 𝑉ℎ (whether the header should be
parsed) is encoded as:
𝑉ℎ = 𝑢ℎ ∨ 
ℎ𝑖 ∈D(ℎ)
𝑢ℎ𝑖
(6)
where D(ℎ) denotes all the headers that depends on header ℎ.
Variable validity. Because there is no dependency relationship
between variables in the Lyra program, the variable’s validity can be
computed via the header usage computation method. The validity
of the internal, global and external variable is denoted as 𝑉𝑖, 𝑉𝑔, and
𝑉𝑒 respectively.
A.2 Parser
In RMT, the parser is implemented as a state machine. Each state in
the state machine represents a parser node in the program and the
transition in the state machine maps to the transition of the parser
nodes. In the hardware, the state machine data is stored in a TCAM
and a RAM table. Each entry in the TCAM table matches 32 bits
of incoming data and 8 bits of parser state. The RAM table stores
the next parser state and where the parsed data is stored. When a
packet comes in, the parser checks both the packet header content
