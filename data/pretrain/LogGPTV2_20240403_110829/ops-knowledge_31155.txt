User: What is OpenShift? Please provide some basic usage guidelines and best practices.
Assistant: OpenShift is a Kubernetes-based container application platform for building, deploying, and running distributed applications. It is an open source tool that helps users accelerate application delivery, speed to innovation, and application manageability. The following are some basic usage guidelines and best practices: 1. Install and deploy OpenShift: There are two types of OpenShift installations: OpenShift Origin and OpenShift Container Platform. If you just want to test and try OpenShift, you can use Origin. If you are an enterprise user, you should choose OpenShift Container Platform. 2. Create an application: OpenShift provides a large number of application templates, including Java, Python, Node.js and other languages and frameworks. Users can select the required template and add the required environment variables, access control and other configuration items. Creating apps from templates is a fast and efficient way to maintain consistent and consistent quality. 3. Deploy the application: OpenShift supports several different deployment methods, including source code deployment, image deployment, and custom deployment. Source code deployment is simple and easy to use, just upload the code to the OpenShift service to complete. Image deployment is to deploy Docker images to the OpenShift platform to facilitate users to reuse code and resources between different services. Custom deployments allow users a higher level of customization and control over the source code and build process. 4. Use builds and continuous integration/continuous delivery: Builders are tools for compiling, building, and packaging code into applications, and are a way to deliver applications to Kubernetes and OpenShift. OpenShift also supports continuous integration/continuous delivery processes, where applications are delivered continuously by setting up automated deployment pipelines. 5. Manage and monitor applications: OpenShift provides a web-based console that can be used to manage and monitor applications and access details such as container logs, health indicators and distributed tracing data. In addition, users can also use the API and CLI interfaces provided by OpenShift to perform various management and monitoring tasks.
