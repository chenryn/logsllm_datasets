Abstract 
In Japan, Japan Meteorological Agency, JMA, has the official responsibility for the public for tsunami forecasts 
and issuance of tsunami information. For the tsunami forecast the first step is precise and prompt estimation of the 
location  and  magnitude  of  the  earthquake  because  generation of  tsunami  is  strongly  controlled  by  the  focal  depth 
and  the  magnitude  of  the  earthquake.  In  case  that  the  location  is  at  sea,  focal  depth  is  shallow  and  magnitude  is 
large, we should expect the tsunami generation. For local tsunami, since JMA started its tsunami forecast in 1952, 
constant  efforts  have  been  made  for  sophistication  and  speedup  of  the  forecast  for  over  50  years.  The  continuous 
improvements enable us to issue a forecast 3 to 4 minutes at the quickest after the occurrence of the earthquake. 
For  distant  tsunami  such  as  ocean  wide  destructive  one,  international  cooperation  of  information  exchange  is 
important. It is necessary to collect seismic waveform data in quasi-real-time from foreign countries for the precise 
forecast,  and  sea  level  data  for  tsunami  observation.  For  both  local  and  distant  cases,  it  is  important  to  keep  the 
seismic observation network and analyzing system well maintained for reliable tsunami forecast. 
Biography 
  Dr.  Mitsuyuki  Hoshiba  joined  Japan  Meteorological  Agency,  JMA,  after  graduation  from  Kyoto  University, 
Japan, and since then he has worked as a seismologist. After spending 17 months as an observer of earthquakes and 
volcanoes at Fukuoka branch office of JMA, he moved to Meteorological Research Institute, MRI, where he worked 
for 15 years as a researcher on seismic wave propagation. He received a doctorate in geophysics in 1993 from Kyoto 
University with a dissertation on multiple scattered seismic waves and excitation of seismic coda. He stayed for 6 
months at University of Southern California for a cooperative research in 1993, and spent a year as visiting scientist 
at University of Munich in 1996. 
Since  two  years  ago,  he  has  worked  at  headquarter  of  JMA  as  a  deputy  director  of  Earthquake  Prediction 
Information  Division.  When  a  large  earthquake  occurs  anywhere  in  Japan,  he  rushes  to  his  office  and  studies  the 
data.
