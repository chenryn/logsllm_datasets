**Abstract**

In Japan, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) is responsible for providing tsunami forecasts and issuing relevant information to the public. The initial step in tsunami forecasting involves the precise and rapid estimation of an earthquake's location and magnitude, as tsunami generation is heavily influenced by the focal depth and magnitude of the seismic event. When an earthquake occurs at sea, with a shallow focal depth and a large magnitude, the potential for tsunami generation is high.

For local tsunamis, JMA has been continuously refining and accelerating its forecasting capabilities since 1952. These ongoing improvements have enabled the agency to issue forecasts within 3 to 4 minutes after an earthquake's occurrence. In the case of distant tsunamis, such as those that can be destructive across entire ocean basins, international cooperation in data exchange is crucial. It is essential to gather seismic waveform data in near real-time from foreign countries to ensure accurate forecasting, as well as to monitor sea level data for tsunami observation.

Maintaining a robust and well-functioning seismic observation network and analysis system is vital for reliable tsunami forecasting, whether the source is local or distant.

**Biography**

Dr. Mitsuyuki Hoshiba joined the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) after graduating from Kyoto University, Japan, and has since worked as a seismologist. He spent 17 months as an observer of earthquakes and volcanoes at the Fukuoka branch office of JMA before moving to the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI), where he conducted research on seismic wave propagation for 15 years. In 1993, Dr. Hoshiba received his doctorate in geophysics from Kyoto University, with a dissertation on multiple scattered seismic waves and the excitation of seismic coda. He also conducted cooperative research at the University of Southern California for six months in 1993 and spent a year as a visiting scientist at the University of Munich in 1996.

For the past two years, Dr. Hoshiba has served as the deputy director of the Earthquake Prediction Information Division at JMA headquarters. Whenever a significant earthquake occurs in Japan, he promptly reports to his office to analyze the data and coordinate the response.
