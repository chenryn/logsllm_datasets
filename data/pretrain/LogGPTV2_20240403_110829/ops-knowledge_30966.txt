User: I'm attempting to install the Pillow fork of PIL, and every method I've tried results in this error:

unable to execute /: Permission denied
error: command '/' failed with exit status 1

This occurs

using pip install Pillow
using easy_install Pillow-master.zip
using python setup.py install
using python setup.py build

The last is the most confusing to me, honestly. I can't even build the module in the same directory it's been extracted to.
I've made sure to install all of the prereqs using homebrew, just as the Pillow readme suggests.
This error has not occurred when installing other python modules.
Edit: I have run all of these commands with and without sudo.
Assistant: I'm assuming you've solved the problem by now.  If you haven't, you can now install pillow using brew by going 
brew install samueljohn/python/pillow.  
Why it isn't just brew install pillow is beyond me.
