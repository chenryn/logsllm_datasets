### Problem Description

I need to automate the process of copying files over a network using Python. The files are located on one machine, and I need to transfer them to remote machines. I am familiar with `os.popen` and `subprocess.Popen` in Python and would like to use these for the task.

However, when I run a command such as:

```bash
scp user@localhost:file1.txt user@192.168.104.XXX:file2.txt
```

it prompts for confirmation to connect and then asks for a password:

```
Are you sure you want to connect (yes/no)?
Password:
```

If I attempt to execute this command in Python using `subprocess.Popen`, it will not handle the interactive prompts correctly, leading to errors. For example, the following Python code:

```python
conn.modules.os.popen("scp user@localhost:file1.txt user@192.168.104.XXX:file2.txt")
conn.modules.os.popen("yes")
```

will produce different and likely erroneous output compared to running the command manually in the terminal.

### Solution

Based on my experience, using SFTP can help manage the host key verification prompt. The first time you connect to a host, you will be prompted to accept the host's public key, as shown below:

```
The authenticity of host 'hostname' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is xxxxxxxx.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Once you accept the host key, it will be saved in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, and subsequent connections will not prompt for host key verification.

To avoid the host key verification prompt in a batch script, you can disable strict host key checking by using the `scp` command with the `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` option:

```bash
scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no user@localhost:file1.txt user@192.168.104.XXX:file2.txt
```

However, disabling strict host key checking makes you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Therefore, it is recommended to manually connect to the target server and save the host public key before deploying your batch script.

Alternatively, you can use a Python library like `paramiko` to handle the file transfer and manage SSH connections more securely. Here is an example using `paramiko`:

```python
import paramiko

# Define the source and destination paths
local_path = 'file1.txt'
remote_path = 'file2.txt'

# Define the SSH connection parameters
hostname = '192.168.104.XXX'
username = 'user'
password = 'your_password'

# Create an SSH client
ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

# Connect to the remote machine
ssh.connect(hostname, username=username, password=password)

# Use SFTP to transfer the file
sftp = ssh.open_sftp()
sftp.put(local_path, remote_path)
sftp.close()

# Close the SSH connection
ssh.close()
```

This approach avoids the need to disable strict host key checking and provides a more secure and robust solution for automated file transfers.

### Notes
- All machines are running CentOS.
- I am using RPyC to connect to other remote machines.
