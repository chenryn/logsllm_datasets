called the jobs of type i. We assume that the size of a job is
exponentially distributed with mean 1/μi and that the capacity
of the machine is C (i.e., on average the machines takes
1/(μiC) unit time to serve a job of type i).
Let Qi be the number of jobs of type i ∈ {1, 2} that are
waiting to be completed by the machine. The machine serves
the jobs by using a GPS policy. This means it uses a fraction
φi/(φ1Q1 + φ2Q2) of its time to each job of type i, where
φi > 0 is a weight. The weight is chosen so as to give priority
to a type of jobs. We refer to [44] for a justiﬁcation and an in-
depth analysis of the pertinence of this model in the context of
cloud systems, where each application represents one virtual
machine or one process running on the same physical machine.
An application that just sent a job waits until the job is
completed. Once the job is received, the application becomes
idle. It waits a time that we assume is randomly distributed and
then sends a new job. In the numerical evaluation, we compare
two possible distributions for the time between jobs:
•
•
(Poisson) an application of type i waits an exponen-
tially distributed time of mean 1/λ(cid:6)
i.
(MAP) an application of type i waits an exponentially
distributed time of mean 1/ai before being active. An
active application then sends a job after a time that is
exponentially distributed with mean 1/λi
We refer to the ﬁrst scenario as “Poisson arrivals” and to the
second one as “MAP” (Markov arrival process).

discipline and a delay (i.e., inﬁnite server) station [43], [44].
We consider an imprecise scenario for which the rate of jobs
creation belongs to an interval [λmin, λmax]. This example
serves two purposes. The ﬁrst
is to demonstrate that our
framework can be used to perform a robust optimisation
of the system parameters. The second is to show in such
systems, the precise distribution of the arrival process of jobs
is fundamental: When jobs are created according to a Poisson
process, the imprecise and uncertain case are similar. This is
not true for more general arrival processes for which having
a varying arrival rate can lead to a higher queue length than
setting a constant λ = λmax.
A. The model
We consider a system in which N applications are treated
by a single machines. There are two types of applications:
There are N1 applications of type 1 and N2 = N − N1
applications of type 2. Each application sends periodically a
job to the machine (the jobs creation process will be described
later). The jobs created by the applications of type i are
This models ﬁts in our framework. For the Poisson arrival
scenario, we describe this system by four variables, Qi, i =
1, 2, the GPS queue length, and Di, i = 1, 2, the number
of applications that are waiting before sending a new job. We
normalise the variables Di and Qi to be in [0, 1], such that Di+
Qi = 1. Transitions of the system are the creation of a job of
type i, bringing the system to state Di−1/Ni, Qi+1/Ni, at rate
λiDi, and the service of an job of type i, changing state to Di+
1/Ni, Qi − 1/Ni. This happens at rate μi
C.
The MAP scenario is modelled similarly by adding two
other variables E1 and E2 to count the applications for which
the job was completed but that are not yet active.

We consider now a scenario in which the arrival rate is not
ﬁxed, but rather an imprecise parameter, varying measurably in
[λmin
]. We computed the maximal values of Q1(t) and
Q2(t) as a function of time for the imprecise and the uncertain
model. The results are reported in Figure 7. The parameters of
the simulations are μ1 = 5, μ2 = 1, φ1 = φ2 = 1, λmin

We make two observations. First, for the Poisson scenario,
the uncertain and the imprecise model give the same upper and

inclusions. We then discussed how to numerically analyse such
limit systems, and show the approximation at work in a model
of epidemic spreading and of generalised processor sharing.
Future work include a deeper investigation of the Pontray-
gin method also for steady state computation and in combi-
nation with (non-linear) templates, to provide tight bounds to
the solutions of a differential inclusion. We will also release
an implementation and test the approach on larger models, to
properly understand its scalability.

that the higher is the arrival rate λ, the more congested is
the system. A more surprising fact is that in the MAP case,
the maximal queue length is signiﬁcantly larger than in the
imprecise scenario. This fact is counter-intuitive, yet it is a
consequence of the delay introduced by the time that the
application take to activate. As for the SIR example, these
upper and lower bounds were computed by using Pontryagin’s
maximum principle.
Our imprecise approximation can also be used to robustly
tune controllable parameters of our system. We consider a sce-
nario in which we want to set the resource allocation weights
φ1 and φ2 in order to minimise the maximum total queue
length: ¯Q(t) = maxθ(Qθ
2(t)). Using the Pontryagin’s
principle, we can compute ¯Q(t) and minimise it numerically
with respect to the weights. As only the ratio of φ1/φ2 plays a
role, we ﬁxed the parameter φ2 = 1. In turns out that the total
queue length is a convex function of φ1 and that the minimum
value of ¯Q(t) is obtained for φ1 = 9.0φ2.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
We presented imprecise population processes, which nat-
urally capture the unavoidable uncertainty and imprecision
inherent in any (stochastic) model of complex phenomena. In
order to analyse efﬁciently these models in the large population
