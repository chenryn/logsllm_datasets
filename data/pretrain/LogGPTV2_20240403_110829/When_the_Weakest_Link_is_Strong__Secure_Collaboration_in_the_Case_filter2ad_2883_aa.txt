Abstract
Success stories in usable security are rare. In this pa-
per, however, we examine one notable security success:
the year-long collaborative investigation of more than
two terabytes of leaked documents during the “Panama
Papers” project. During this effort, a large, diverse group
of globally-distributed journalists met and maintained
critical security goals–including protecting the source of
the leaked documents and preserving the secrecy of the
project until the desired launch date–all while hundreds
of journalists collaborated remotely on a near-daily basis.
Through survey data from 118 participating journal-
ists, as well as in-depth, semi-structured interviews with
the designers and implementers of the systems under-
pinning the collaboration, we investigate the factors that
supported this effort. We ﬁnd that the tools developed for
the project were both highly useful and highly usable,
motivating journalists to use the secure communica-
tion platforms provided instead of seeking workarounds.
We also found that, despite having little prior com-
puter security experience, journalists adopted—and even
appreciated—the strict security requirements imposed
by the project leads. We also ﬁnd that a shared sense
of community and responsibility contributed to partici-
pants’ motivation to meet and maintain security require-
ments. From these and other ﬁndings, we distill lessons
for socio-technical systems with strong security require-
ments and identify opportunities for future work.

On April 3, 2016, a coordinated network of dozens of
news organizations around the world [32] began publish-
ing stories based on a set of year-long investigations into
the uses of offshore funds by clients of the Panamanian
law ﬁrm Mossack Fonseca. The revelations contained
in these “Panama Papers” led to the ouster of Icelandic
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson [17],
and helped instigate investigations from Argentina and
Australia to Canada, Denmark, France, India, Indonesia,
Introduction
Mexico, Pakistan, and others [42].
(ICIJ),
Facilitated by the International Consortium of In-
vestigative Journalists
the Panama Papers
project [31] represents a uniquely positive security case
study, wherein systems designed,
implemented, and
managed by a handful of ICIJ staffers helped meet and
maintain the organization’s security goals for the project.
While it is impossible to state deﬁnitively that this (or
any) system could not have been compromised, ICIJ’s
efforts appear to have been successful in maintaining
their primary security goals, including: (1) protecting
the identity of the source of the Panama Papers’ docu-
ments (2) maintaining control of the documents within
their network of collaborators and preventing their early
public disclosure, (3) protecting the documents them-
selves from attackers (e.g., the companies, criminals and
political ﬁgures they implicated), and, ﬁnally (4) keep-
ing the investigation itself a secret for over a year. Re-
markably, all of this was achieved while supporting the
collaborative analysis of the documents by nearly 400
journalist-contributors worldwide, who communicated
regularly across time zones and language barriers.
In the computer security literature and beyond, users
are often referred to as “the weakest link” in security
systems (e.g., [26, 48, 50]). Recent case studies on ac-
tivist organizations and NGOs [21, 39, 43], for example,
highlight such security failures in context. Through ex-
amination of the Panama Papers project, then, we seek
to learn (1) what technical and human factors facilitated
the successful preservation of the project’s security goals
and, (2) what lessons can be drawn from this case study
to support the development of similarly effective pro-
cesses for both journalistic collaborations and secure, us-
able systems in general. For while the technical systems
used in the Panama Papers project did not necessarily in-
corporate all technical security best practices, our inves-
tigation helps illuminate how the systems’ hundreds of
users were nevertheless able to collaborate securely over
a long period of time.

To uncover the factors that contributed to the Panama
Papers’ security success, we (1) analyze survey data col-
lected from 118 journalists involved in the project, and
(2) conduct in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the
designers and implementers of the technical systems and
collaborative processes underpinning the Panama Papers
collaboration. These systems1 included:
• Blacklight (Figure 1), a document-search plat-
form where contributing journalists could access the
leaked documents.
• I-Hub (Figure 2), a collaboration and communi-
cation platform where contributors formed interest
groups, shared discoveries, and exchanged ideas.
• Linkurious (Figure 3), a visualization system that
provided visual graphs of the relationships between
entities mentioned in the leaked documents.
From this survey and interview data, we identify sev-
eral key design decisions and deployment strategies that
appear to have contributed to the security successes of
the project.

For example, we were surprised to learn that project
leaders were able to consistently enforce strict security
requirements–such as two-factor authentication and the
use of PGP–despite the fact that few of the participants
had previously used these technologies. Our ﬁndings
suggest that journalists found the collaboration systems
provided so useful that they relied on them in spite of
sometimes onerous security requirements. We observe
that project leaders also frequently and consistently ar-
ticulated the importance of security measures, explic-
itly cultivating a sense of collaboration, mutual trust
and shared security responsibility among system users.
Moreover, this organizational buy-in for security mea-
sures went beyond rhetoric:
in one instance, the orga-
nization bought and set up phones as second factors for
journalists who did not have them.
From these and other ﬁndings, we distill lessons and
recommendations for integrating computer security mea-
sures into future socio-technical systems. For example,
we recommend normalizing secure communication re-
quirements to reduce the decision-making burden they
may otherwise impose. In the Panama Papers project, for
example, making PGP a default tool and ensuring every-
one had a PGP key meant that participants did not need to
expend additional energy evaluating secure communica-
tion options. We also identify opportunities for future re-
search, such as comparing this to other security successes
to determine which factors are necessary and/or sufﬁ-
cient to achieve similarly effective secure socio-technical
systems.
Instrumenting technical systems to achieve a
more complete picture of activity and possible compro-
mises would also contribute to this understanding.

In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We analyze quantitative survey data from 118 jour-
• We conduct semi-structured,
in-depth interviews
with key stakeholders–including editorial and tech-
nical staff– involved in designing and implementing
the technical systems used in the collaboration.
• From these two datasets, we investigate the socio-
technical systems that supported the realization of
the security goals of the Panama Papers’ project.
• We identify an actively maintained and explicitly
articulated culture of security that leveraged peer-
oriented trust and accountability. We also identify
several technical security issues that may have been
present, but do not appear to have led to compro-
mise in this case.
• Based on this case study, we make recommenda-
tions for future socio-technical systems with strong
computer security requirements and identify oppor-
tunities for future work.
Overall, the Panama Papers project—which required
international collaboration among hundreds of journal-
ists over an entire year—is a unique case study that pro-
vides insight into the design and deployment of secure
communication and collaboration systems for diverse,
distributed organizations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is one of the ﬁrst in-depth case studies of such a secu-
rity success. Though this paper is neither a comprehen-
sive description of the technical features of the Panama
Papers’ systems, nor a prescription for technical security
best practices, we believe the insights presented here–
taken in conjunction with existing technical security best
practices–provide a valuable foundation for secure col-
laborative system design.
2 Background
In this section, we provide speciﬁc background on the
Panama Papers project (unless otherwise noted, details
here are sourced from [12], published by ICIJ). Addi-
tional related work is discussion in Section 7.
The International Consortium of Investigative Journal-
ists (ICIJ) is a non-proﬁt, selective-membership organi-
zation founded in 1997. Comprised of just under 200
investigative journalists in more than 65 countries, since
2012 ICIJ has obtained several caches of leaked docu-
ments that have led to collaborative investigations across
news organizations around the world (e.g., [28–30]). Yet,
in the words of one ICIJ staffer interviewed for this pa-
per, the Panama Papers project [31] — which lasted from
approximately May 2015 to April 2016 — was where the
organization’s work collaborative and analytical systems
“all came together.”
Consisting of over 11.5 million documents in dozens
of formats occupying 2.6 TB of disk space, the Panama
Papers dataset was by far the largest and most complex
that ICIJ had handled (the “Offshore Leaks” project, by
contrast, comprised only 260 GB [13]). While just one
staffer was devoted to research during ICIJ’s ﬁrst major
leak project in 2011, by 2016, data and research positions
comprised half of ICIJ’s 12-person staff.
To deal with the enormous scale and complexity of the
data, as well as facilitate the large, globally distributed
team required to investigate it, ICIJ’s Data and Research
Unit built and/or reﬁned several systems whose develop-
ment had begun during prior document-based projects.
Favoring open-source technologies, they chose Tesser-
act [7] to OCR the documents, Apache Tika [2] for doc-
ument processing, and Apache Solr [1] for indexing.
The UI for this last platform also became its namesake,
Project Blacklight [6] (see Figure 1).
ICIJ also developed a secure communication hub–
called Global I-Hub–by customizing OxWall [5], an ex-
isting open-source messaging platform (Figure 2). Fi-
nally, ICIJ licensed the Linkurious software [4] to visu-
ally graph relationships among entities that appeared in
the data (Figure 3).
3 Methods
To better understand the decisions that shaped the
Panama Papers’ suite of collaboration systems–as well as
identify factors that may have contributed to the success-
ful maintenance of the group’s security goals–we con-
ducted two studies: an analysis of survey data collected
from Panama Papers project contributors by the ICIJ, and
a semi-structured, in-depth interview with each member
of the ICIJ staff who had signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the
security features and policies related to the Blacklight,
I-Hub and Linkurious systems.
3.1 Participants
All survey participants are investigative journalists who
actively participated in the Panama Papers project. All
interview participants currently work full-time for the
ICIJ and/or had a signiﬁcant role in determining the se-
curity features and requirements of the collaboration sys-
tems used throughout the project by the journalists sur-
veyed. In the results presented here, participants com-
pleted either a survey or an interview.
Survey. Survey participants were 118 journalists work-
ing in 58 different countries representing every continent
except Antarctica. No other demographic data was col-
lected. This sample represents approximately 33% (118
of 354) of all non-ICIJ staff who worked on the project.
Interview.
ICIJ consists of only twelve full-time em-
ployees. For this study we interviewed all ﬁve of the ICIJ
personnel with signiﬁcant editorial or technical input on
the systems used during the Panama Papers project. In-

terview participants were two technical and two edito-
rial management staff of ICIJ, as well as the journalist
who received the original Panama Papers materials and
worked closely with ICIJ on the system requirements. Of
these ﬁve participants, two participants were women and
three were men. To maximize the insight gained from
these interviews, we designed the interview script us-
ing information from a careful review of public infor-
mation available about the systems (e.g., [10, 36]), as
well as insight from an IRB-approved background (pi-
lot) interview with an individual member of the Panama
Papers project who had intimate knowledge of the sys-
tems involved. The team then collected and iteratively
reﬁned the major themes for the interviews, customiz-
ing their content based on the individual’s primary (self-
identiﬁed) role in the project as either an editorial (E) or
technical (IT) leader.
