**Abstract:**
Success stories in usable security are rare. This paper examines a notable security success: the year-long collaborative investigation of more than two terabytes of leaked documents during the "Panama Papers" project. A large, diverse group of globally-distributed journalists met and maintained critical security goals, including protecting the source of the leaked documents and preserving the secrecy of the project until the desired launch date, all while hundreds of journalists collaborated remotely on a near-daily basis.

Through survey data from 118 participating journalists and in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the designers and implementers of the systems underpinning the collaboration, we investigate the factors that supported this effort. We find that the tools developed for the project were both highly useful and highly usable, motivating journalists to use the secure communication platforms provided instead of seeking workarounds. Despite having little prior computer security experience, journalists adopted—and even appreciated—the strict security requirements imposed by the project leads. A shared sense of community and responsibility also contributed to participants' motivation to meet and maintain security requirements. From these and other findings, we distill lessons for socio-technical systems with strong security requirements and identify opportunities for future work.

**Introduction:**
On April 3, 2016, a coordinated network of dozens of news organizations around the world [32] began publishing stories based on a set of year-long investigations into the uses of offshore funds by clients of the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. The revelations contained in these "Panama Papers" led to the ouster of Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson [17] and instigated investigations in multiple countries [42]. Facilitated by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), the Panama Papers project [31] represents a uniquely positive security case study, wherein systems designed, implemented, and managed by a handful of ICIJ staffers helped meet and maintain the organization's security goals for the project.

While it is impossible to state definitively that this (or any) system could not have been compromised, ICIJ’s efforts appear to have been successful in maintaining their primary security goals, including:
1. Protecting the identity of the source of the Panama Papers’ documents.
2. Maintaining control of the documents within their network of collaborators and preventing their early public disclosure.
3. Protecting the documents themselves from attackers (e.g., the companies, criminals, and political figures they implicated).
4. Keeping the investigation itself a secret for over a year.

Remarkably, all of this was achieved while supporting the collaborative analysis of the documents by nearly 400 journalist-contributors worldwide, who communicated regularly across time zones and language barriers.

In the computer security literature and beyond, users are often referred to as “the weakest link” in security systems (e.g., [26, 48, 50]). Recent case studies on activist organizations and NGOs [21, 39, 43] highlight such security failures in context. Through examination of the Panama Papers project, we seek to learn:
1. What technical and human factors facilitated the successful preservation of the project’s security goals.
2. What lessons can be drawn from this case study to support the development of similarly effective processes for both journalistic collaborations and secure, usable systems in general.

**Background:**
The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) is a non-profit, selective-membership organization founded in 1997. Comprised of just under 200 investigative journalists in more than 65 countries, since 2012, ICIJ has obtained several caches of leaked documents that have led to collaborative investigations across news organizations around the world (e.g., [28–30]). The Panama Papers project, which lasted from approximately May 2015 to April 2016, was where the organization’s collaborative and analytical systems “all came together.”

Consisting of over 11.5 million documents in dozens of formats occupying 2.6 TB of disk space, the Panama Papers dataset was by far the largest and most complex that ICIJ had handled. To deal with the enormous scale and complexity of the data, as well as facilitate the large, globally distributed team required to investigate it, ICIJ’s Data and Research Unit built and/or refined several systems. These included:
- Tesseract [7] for OCR.
- Apache Tika [2] for document processing.
- Apache Solr [1] for indexing.
- Project Blacklight [6] for the UI (see Figure 1).

ICIJ also developed a secure communication hub—called Global I-Hub—by customizing OxWall [5], an existing open-source messaging platform (Figure 2). Finally, ICIJ licensed the Linkurious software [4] to visually graph relationships among entities that appeared in the data (Figure 3).

**Methods:**
To better understand the decisions that shaped the Panama Papers’ suite of collaboration systems and identify factors that may have contributed to the successful maintenance of the group’s security goals, we conducted two studies:
1. An analysis of survey data collected from 118 Panama Papers project contributors by the ICIJ.
2. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including editorial and technical staff involved in designing and implementing the technical systems used in the collaboration.

**Participants:**
- **Survey Participants:** 118 investigative journalists working in 58 different countries, representing approximately 33% (118 of 354) of all non-ICIJ staff who worked on the project.
- **Interview Participants:** Five ICIJ personnel with significant editorial or technical input on the systems used during the Panama Papers project, including two technical and two editorial management staff, and the journalist who received the original Panama Papers materials.

**Materials:**
- **Survey Instrument:** Created by ICIJ to investigate collaborating journalists’ use of the Blacklight, I-Hub, and Linkurious systems.
- **Interview Scripts:** Customized based on the individual’s primary role in the project (editorial or technical leader).

| Two-factor       | 14%     | 13%   | 14% | 15%          | 42%        |

**Conclusion:**
The Panama Papers project, which required international collaboration among hundreds of journalists over an entire year, is a unique case study that provides insight into the design and deployment of secure communication and collaboration systems for diverse, distributed organizations. Our findings suggest that the tools developed for the project were highly useful and usable, and that a shared sense of community and responsibility contributed to the successful maintenance of security goals. Based on this case study, we make recommendations for future socio-technical systems with strong computer security requirements and identify opportunities for future work.
