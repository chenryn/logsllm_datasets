Question: In a discussion about adversary tactics, one team member claims that collecting the battery status information from compromised hosts is typically irrelevant for APT actors when establishing a foothold within a network. Which of the following would serve as the best counterargument to this claim?
"A": "Battery status could indicate the use of a mobile or portable device, which might be outside the network's secure perimeter more often.",
"B": "Battery status is critical to APTs as it always indicates the presence of an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) which they can exploit.",
"C": "APT actors are only interested in high-value targets, and battery status does not correlate with the value of a system.",
"D": "APTs focus exclusively on data exfiltration and would not waste time on peripheral system information such as battery status."
Answer: A
