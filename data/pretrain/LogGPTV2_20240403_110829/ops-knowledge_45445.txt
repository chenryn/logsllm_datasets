User: How to build a highly available Nginx server?
Assistant: The following are some steps to build a highly available Nginx server: 1. Deploy master-slave nodes: Install and configure Nginx on two or more servers, one of which serves as the master node, and the other nodes serve as backup nodes. 2. Synchronize files: Use file synchronization tools such as rsync to synchronize important files such as configuration files and log files of the master node to the backup node to ensure that the backup node can respond to requests in a timely manner. 3. Configure load balancing: Use Nginx's built-in load balancing module or a third-party module to distribute requests to different servers according to certain rules to achieve load balancing. 4. Monitoring node status: use monitoring tools (such as Zabbix, Nagios, etc.) to regularly detect the master and slave nodes, find faults and deal with them in time to ensure high availability. 5. Configure master-slave switching: When the master node fails, it will automatically switch to the backup node to ensure uninterrupted services. Common switching methods include heartbeat check and VIP drifting.
