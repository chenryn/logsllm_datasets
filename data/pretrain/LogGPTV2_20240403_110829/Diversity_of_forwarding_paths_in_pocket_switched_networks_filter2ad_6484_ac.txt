In other words, from a non trivial initial condition, the
average number of nodes with exactly n paths in a large
network evolves according to a deterministic equation.

5.1.3 Solution for ODEs, moments
We introduce for all x ∈ R the series φx :
(cid:12)→
k≥0 xkuk(t). After multiplying each equation in (1) by
t
xk and summing all of them we obtain
x − φx) .

Note that this equation may be rewritten as:
λ · dt =
dφx
φx(φx − 1)
=
dφx
φx − 1
+
dφx
φx
.
This ordinary diﬀerential equation can be solved for all
x ∈ R. One needs to distinguish between two cases, depend-
ing on the initial value taken by φx.
• Assume 0  1 (for instance, by
choosing x > 1). We know that φx and φx − 1 remains
positive. The previous equation may then be written
as:
.
ln(φx(t) − 1) − ln(φx(t)) − λt is constant.
Hence, φx(t) =
φx(0)
φx(0) − (φx(0) − 1)eλt
.

thus E [Sn(t)] =

The last equation is obtained from (2) since
∂φx(t)
∂x (x) =
∂φx(0)
∂x (x)
D(x, t)
− φx(0) · ∂φx(0)
∂x (x) · (1 − eλt)
D(x, t)2

with D(x, t) = φx(0) + (1 − φx(0)) · eλt, so D(1, t) = 1 for
all t.
5.2 The Effects of Inhomogeneity
The analysis developed in Section 5.1 sheds considerable
light, but does not explain all the phenomena noted in Sec-
tion 4.2. The analytic results conﬁrm that path explosion
can occur and that it should be exponential in nature. How-
ever, the analysis in Section 5.1 would also predict that op-
timal paths should be short, and that path explosion should
occur immediately after the ﬁrst path reaches the destina-
tion. These two predictions are not borne out in the data, as
already shown in Section 4.2. To explain these phenomena,
we need to examine the model assumptions.
The most unrealistic aspect of our analytic model is the
assumption that all nodes contact each other at the same
rate. In fact, prior work has shown that per-node contact
rates in datasets like ours can be highly variable across dif-
ferent nodes. For example, the authors in [9] show that the
distributional tails of inter-contact times for such data sets
approximately follow a power law.
In Fig. 6 we plot the CDF for the total number of contacts
each node has over each three hour period (Infocom ’06 9-
12, 3-6, Conext 9-12, and 3-6). We refer to the number of
contacts a node makes per unit time as the node’s contact
rate or just rate. The CDFs suggest that the distribution of
contact rates can be approximated as uniform over the range
(0, max) where max varies depending on the dataset. The
key observation is that some nodes have rates quite close to
zero, yielding extremely large average intercontact times. In
fact, it is clear that the population consists of some nodes
that are quite frequently in contact with a large number
of other nodes, while there are also some nodes that rarely
encounter other nodes at all.
Our analytic results suggest that for a message generated
at time 0, the number of paths reaching node i will grow
proportional to eλt for a population in which all nodes have
the same rate λ.
To discuss the case where nodes have diﬀerent rates, we
introduce some notation. We deﬁne the random variable

 t0, xi encounters a node
xj with contact rate λj > λi, then a more rapid path ex-
plosion beginning at t1 will occur with rate λj among nodes
with contact rates λj or greater.
Thus if the source is a low-rate node, then there will be
some initial time before it encounters a high-rate node, at
which point a high-rate path explosion occurs. This initial
time is related to H and so we argue that the time until high-
rate path explosion occurs is on the order of 1/λi. Thus in
this case, T1 will tend to be larger than is typical.
Furthermore, if the destination is a low-rate node, then
path explosion may not be able to reach a high rate. Thus
in this case, TE will tend to be large.
This model suggests that a critically important role is
played by the contact rates of the source and destination
nodes. Then we can make the following hypotheses con-
cerning the relative sizes of T1 and TE for four situations:
• First, when λσ is high and λδ is high, then path ex-
plosion begins immediately and at high rate. So both
T1 and TE will tend to be small.
• Next, when λσ is high and λδ is low, then path explo-
sion begins immediately but at a low rate. So T1 will
tend to be small but TE will tend to be large.
• Next, when λσ is low and λδ is high, then there is
a signiﬁcant period before path explosion begins (on
the order of 1/λσ) but, once begun, path explosion
proceeds at high rate. So T1 will tend to be large but
TE will tend to be small.
• Finally, when λσ is low and λδ is low, then both T1
and TE will tend to be large.
To explore whether these hypotheses hold in our data, we
separated nodes in each dataset into two equal-sized groups.
The in set are those nodes with contact rates greater than
the median rate. The out set are those nodes with contact
rates lower than the median rate. Since rate distribution is
approximately uniform (as shown in Figure 6), the median
rate in each case is approximately half of the maximum rate.
Then each message (σ, δ, t1) can be placed into one of four
cases: in-in, where λσ and λδ are both high; in-out, where
λσ is high and λδ is low; out-in, where λσ is low and λδ is
high; and out-out, where λσ and λδ are both low.
Using this labeling, we separate the points in Figure 4 into
four groups, which are plotted separately in Figure 7. Each
plot has the same format as Figure 4, except that only a
subset of points are included.
The ﬁgures suggest that our hypotheses hold to a certain
extent. In particular,
• For all the in-in messages, the optimal path duration
T1 is very low and the time to explosion TE is less than
150 seconds.
• For the in-out messages, the optimal path duration T1
is similar to the in-in messages, i.e., small. However
the time to explosion TE is much more variable and
can take on relatively large values.
• For the out-in case, the optimal path duration T1 tends
to be larger than in the ﬁrst two cases, while the time
to explosion TE is relatively small (as in the in-in case).
• Finally, for the out-out case, both T1 and TE can take
on large values.
