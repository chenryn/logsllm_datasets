**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Segmentation

To enhance security, implement network segmentation and control the movement of software between business and operational technology (OT) environments. This can be achieved through the use of one-directional demilitarized zones (DMZs). Web access from the OT environment should be restricted to minimize potential attack vectors. Engineering workstations, including transient cyber assets (TCAs), should have limited connectivity to external networks, such as the Internet and email. Additionally, avoid dual-homing these devices to multiple networks to further reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration. [6]
