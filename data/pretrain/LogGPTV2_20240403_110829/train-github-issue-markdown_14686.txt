**Current behavior**  
So I am maintaining 4 very large projects in Angular.  
There is no way for me to know, when I open each project, which code has been
deprecated.  
The only reported issue I see is when I run AOT, a message of `` now
needing to be ``  
However, there are no mentions of any issues with things like Renderer now
needing to ne Renderer2.
**Expected behavior**  
I expect TypeScript and / or cli to report a summary of all deprecated API so
we can fix'em before ng5 is out.
    @angular/cli: 1.0.0
    node: 6.9.5
    os: win32 x64
    @angular/animations: 4.0.0
    @angular/common: 4.0.0
    @angular/compiler: 4.0.0
    @angular/core: 4.0.0
    @angular/forms: 4.0.0
    @angular/http: 4.0.0
    @angular/platform-browser: 4.0.0
    @angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 4.0.0
    @angular/router: 4.0.0
    @angular/cli: 1.0.0
    @angular/compiler-cli: 4.0.0
    @angular/language-service: 4.0.0
    @ngtools/webpack: 1.3.0
Not sure if this issue should be opened against cli repo.
FYI, in WebStorm I will see cross outs on deprecated API, but again, I am
dealing with thousands of files so I can't open each one and look for cross
outs, see below:
