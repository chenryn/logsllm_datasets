### Current Behavior

I am currently maintaining four large Angular projects. When I open each project, there is no straightforward way to identify which parts of the code have been deprecated. The only deprecation notice I receive is when I run Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, and it mentions that a specific API needs to be updated. However, there are no warnings or messages about other deprecations, such as the need to update `Renderer` to `Renderer2`.

### Expected Behavior

I expect TypeScript and/or the Angular CLI to provide a summary of all deprecated APIs so that we can address them before the release of Angular 5.

### Environment

- @angular/cli: 1.0.0
- Node: 6.9.5
- OS: Windows 32 x64
- @angular/animations: 4.0.0
- @angular/common: 4.0.0
- @angular/compiler: 4.0.0
- @angular/core: 4.0.0
- @angular/forms: 4.0.0
- @angular/http: 4.0.0
- @angular/platform-browser: 4.0.0
- @angular/platform-browser-dynamic: 4.0.0
- @angular/router: 4.0.0
- @angular/cli: 1.0.0
- @angular/compiler-cli: 4.0.0
- @angular/language-service: 4.0.0
- @ngtools/webpack: 1.3.0

### Additional Information

I'm not sure if this issue should be opened against the CLI repository. In WebStorm, I can see deprecated APIs marked with a strikethrough, but given the scale of my projects, manually checking each file is impractical. Here is an example of what I see in WebStorm:
