I am currently in search of a suitable scripting language to integrate with my program, and I have two key requirements:

1. The scripting language must be hard-linked into the executable, eliminating the need for any third-party installations. This is crucial for simplifying the distribution process.
2. The scripting language should support runtime debugging. Specifically, I need the ability to easily debug scripts while they are running within the context of my program.

Could Python, Lua, or another language meet these requirements?

**Response:**

Lua is an excellent choice for embedding due to its lightweight nature and ease of integration. It can be compiled directly into your executable, which simplifies distribution. Additionally, Lua supports runtime debugging through various tools and libraries, such as `luadebug` and `mobdebug`, which allow you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code.

Another alternative is JavaScript, which can be embedded in C, C++, and Java applications using engines like SpiderMonkey, V8, and Rhino. These engines can also be linked directly into your executable, and they offer robust debugging capabilities, often including built-in or third-party debugger support.

Both Lua and JavaScript are well-suited for your needs, but Lua might be more straightforward for embedding and has a smaller footprint, making it a popular choice for many applications.
