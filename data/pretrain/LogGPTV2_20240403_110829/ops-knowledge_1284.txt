User: I am looking for a good scripting language to link to my program.
I am looking for 2 important attributes:

Scripting language should be hard linked into the executable (not requiring 3rd party 
installations). This is important to me to simplify distribution.
Scripting should allow some run-time debugging option (When running a script inside my program I would like to easily run it inside a debugger while it is running in the context of my program)

Can python,lua or some other language supply me with this?
Assistant: I really like Lua for embedding, but just as another alternative, JavaScript is easily embeddable in C, C++ (SpiderMonkey and V8) and Java (Rhino) programs.
