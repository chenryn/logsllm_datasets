User: Please describe common troubleshooting tools and methods, and explain their application scenarios.
Assistant: Common fault diagnosis tools and methods are: 1. Fault code reader: used to read vehicle fault codes, and can be used to diagnose faults in automobile engines, gearboxes and electronic systems. 2. Multimeter: It is used to detect circuit status, voltage, current and other parameters, and can be used to diagnose failures of electronic products and electrical products. 3. Oscilloscope: It is used to observe and measure the electrical signal changes in the circuit, and can be used to diagnose faults in electronic products and communication equipment. 4. Infrared temperature measuring gun: used to measure the temperature of objects, and can be used to diagnose electrical equipment and mechanical equipment failures. 5. Sound Spectrum Analyzer: It is used to analyze the frequency and intensity of sound signals, and can be used to diagnose mechanical equipment, audio equipment and other faults. 6. Infrared microscope: used to observe tiny objects or components, and can be used to diagnose the failure of tiny mechanical components. The above tools can be flexibly used in different application scenarios and fault diagnosis requirements. For example, oscilloscopes and multimeters are generally used to detect faults in electronic products; fault code readers are often used to judge faults in automobile engines, gearboxes, and electronic systems; infrared temperature guns can be used to measure motor heating or abnormal temperature faults; The sound spectrum analyzer is used to detect the running sound of the machine, analyze the fault, etc. Infrared microscopes can be used to check electrical components for failures, causes of debris. In general, reasonable selection of fault diagnosis tools and methods is crucial to quickly and accurately judge and solve fault problems.
