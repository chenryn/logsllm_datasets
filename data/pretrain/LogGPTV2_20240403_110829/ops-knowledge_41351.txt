Question: On a Mac with Apple silicon, there are three security policies: Full Security, Reduced Security, and Permissive Security. Each policy offers different levels of protection and operational capabilities. Select the statements that accurately describe the features or implications of these security policies.
"A": "Full Security policy uses a personalized signature for each Apple CPU, tying a version of macOS to a specific Mac, which provides better protection against rollback attacks.",
"B": "Reduced Security allows for the booting of any third-party kernel extensions without requiring a reboot due to the inclusion in the Auxiliary Kernel Collection.",
"C": "Permissive Security allows the booting of user-generated Boot Kernel Collections and supports running fully untrusted operating system kernels.",
"D": "The Permissive Security setting disables signature verifications entirely, allowing any software to be booted without checks."
Answer: AC
