### Title: Black Hat USA 2021 - How to Tame Your Unicorn: Exploring and Exploiting Zero-Click Remote Interfaces of Modern Huawei Smartphones

Over the past decade, research into baseband security has made significant strides. Studies have uncovered privacy issues in 3GPP protocols, ranging from GSM to LTE, and have identified traditional memory safety vulnerabilities in the implementations of various chipset vendors. However, in many respects, we have only scratched the surface.

For instance, almost all published memory corruption vulnerabilities have been classic TLV parsing issues in Layer 3 GSM. Additionally, previous remote exploitation demonstrations have primarily focused on basebands as code performing typical input parsing, without considering the complex hardware environment that surrounds them. These demonstrations have generally remained within the confines of the baseband sandbox.

Our research aims to challenge this status quo by investigating the latest iterations of Huawei's Kirin System-on-Chips (SoCs). Following Pwn2Own 2017, Huawei ceased support for unlocked bootloaders, introduced new firmware encryption for SoC components, and significantly invested in improving code quality in response to a well-known baseband source leak. In fact, the most recent Kirin chipsets that have been the subject of published research date back to 2016.

In this presentation, we will share our journey from unlocking the newest generations of Huawei devices to identifying and exploiting bootloader vulnerabilities, and ultimately building a debugger to reverse-engineer the new mitigation improvements in the baseband operating system. We will delve into a part of the 3GPP stack that has received little attention and present our findings on reversing Huawei's implementation. We will also discuss the discovery of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities that differ from previously documented baseband memory corruption bugs.

Finally, we will explore the ways in which the baseband interacts with the rest of the SoC. We will present several vulnerabilities we have found, both in software and hardware, and explain how we exploited them to escape the baseband sandbox. Our methods allowed us to gain control not only over Android and the Linux kernel but also over TrustZone.
