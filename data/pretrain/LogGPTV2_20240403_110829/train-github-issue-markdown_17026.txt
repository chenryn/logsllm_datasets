I installed babel and run `babel-node` which version is 5.8.21.
    > const b = 1
    'use strict'
    > b =2 
    2
    > b
    2
    > const b = 3
    'use strict'
    > b
    3
Obviously the ES6 code result is not correct. I compile the code with io.js,
it throw the erro message:
    TypeError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared
Why babel-node let constant variable changedï¼Ÿ
