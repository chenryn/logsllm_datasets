### Analysis of Censored and Allowed Requests

A small fraction (1.38%) of the requests are censored, with 16.2% generating TCP errors. Figure 8(a) illustrates the number of requests from August 1 to August 6, showing several traffic peaks, particularly on August 3, coinciding with several protests. Notably, 99.9% of the censored Tor traffic is blocked by a single proxy (SG-44), even though the overall traffic is uniformly distributed across all seven proxies. The remaining 0.01% of the censored traffic is handled by SG-48. This finding aligns with our earlier discussion on the specialization of certain proxies.

### Temporal Patterns and Consistency of Censorship

We analyzed the temporal patterns of censored Tor traffic and compared them to the overall censored requests of SG-44. As shown in Figure 8(b), Tor censorship exhibits higher variance. While censoring Tor HTTP traffic is technically straightforward, involving regular expression matching against HTTP requests, identifying and censoring Tor onion services is more challenging due to the encryption involved. However, only Tor onion traffic is censored according to the logs, while Tor HTTP traffic is always allowed.

To assess the consistency of Tor censorship, we created a set of all censored Tor relay addresses, denoted as `Censored-IPs`. For each one-hour time window (time bin `k`), we also created a set of all Tor relays that were allowed, denoted as `Allowed-IPs(k)`. We then calculated the relative overlap between the censored Tor relay nodes and the allowed Tor relays at each time bin `k` using the formula:

\[ R_{\text{filter}}(k) = 1 - \frac{|Censored-IPs \cap Allowed-IPs(k)|}{|Censored-IPs|} \]

where `| · |` denotes the set size. Figure 9 shows the variation of \( R_{\text{filter}} \) over time. A value of \( R_{\text{filter}}(k) = 0 \) indicates that all connections to `Censored-IPs` are allowed at a specific time bin `k`, while \( R_{\text{filter}}(k) = 1 \) indicates that none of the connections to `Censored-IPs` are allowed at that time bin.

The high variance in \( R_{\text{filter}} \) suggests inconsistent censorship. Initially, the plot is dominated by periods where all traffic is allowed or where there is mild censorship. This is followed by periods of high variance in blockage, with a lull at night on August 3. This pattern repeats, alternating between aggressive and mild censorship. This behavior is difficult to explain, but one possible explanation is a testing phase for new censorship approaches, or censorship based on fields not logged by the appliance.

### Web Proxies and VPNs

As previously mentioned, access to web/socks proxies is heavily censored, as demonstrated by the aggressive filtering of requests containing the keyword "proxy." In this context, "proxies" refer to the Blue Coat appliances whose logs we study, while "web proxies" refer to services used to circumvent censorship.

To use web proxies, end-users must configure their browsers or network interfaces, or rely on tools like Ultrasurf that automatically redirect HTTP traffic to the web proxy. Some web proxies support encryption, creating an SSL-based encrypted HTTP tunnel. Similarly, VPN tools (e.g., Hotspot Shield) are often used to circumvent censorship by relaying traffic through a VPN server.

Our analysis of VPN and web proxy usage shows that a few such tools are very popular among Internet users in Syria. However, keywords like "ultrasurf" and "hotspotshield" are heavily monitored and censored. Some web proxies and VPN software (such as Freegate, GTunnel, and GPass) do not include the keyword "proxy" in request URLs and are therefore not censored. Additionally, we did not observe any censorship triggered by the keyword "VPN."

### Anonymizer Domains

Next, we focused on domains categorized as "Anonymizers" by McAfee’s TrustedSource tool, including both web proxies and VPN-related hosts. In the Dsample dataset, there are 821 "Anonymizer" domains, which received 122K requests (0.4% of the total). 92.7% of these hosts (accounting for 25% of the requests) are never filtered. Figure 10(a) shows the CDF of the number of requests sent to each allowed host. Less than 10% of these hosts receive more than 100 requests, indicating that only a few popular services attract a high number of requests.

For the 7.3% of "Anonymizer" hosts with some censored requests, we calculated the ratio between the number of allowed requests in Dfull and the number of censored requests in Ddenied. Figure 10(b) shows the CDF of this censorship ratio. The policy for allowing or censoring requests is inconsistent, with more than 50% of the proxies showing a higher number of allowed requests than censored ones. This suggests that requests are not censored based on IP or hostname, but rather on other criteria, such as the inclusion of blacklisted keywords in the request.

In conclusion, while some services (e.g., Hotspot Shield) are heavily censored, less known services are not, unless related requests contain blacklisted keywords. This introduces a trade-off between bypassing censorship and promoting censorship- and surveillance-evading tools by including keywords like "proxy" in the URL.

### Peer-to-Peer Networks

The distributed architecture of peer-to-peer networks makes them more resilient to censorship. Users obtain content from peers rather than servers, making it harder to locate and block content. Shared data is identified by unique identifiers (e.g., info hash in BitTorrent), which are useless to censors unless mapped back to file descriptions. Resolving these identifiers is non-trivial, as content can be created and distributed in various ways, both publicly and privately.

To investigate the use of P2P networks for accessing censored content, we analyzed BitTorrent traffic. We found 338,168 BitTorrent announce requests from 38,575 users for 35,331 unique contents in the Dfull dataset. Most of these requests (99.97%) are allowed. Censored requests are often due to blacklisted keywords, such as "proxy," in the request URL. For example, all announce requests sent to the tracker on `tracker-proxy.furk.net` are censored.

Using the hashes of torrent files provided in the announce messages, we crawled `torrentz.eu` and `torrentproject.com` to extract the titles of these torrent files, achieving a success rate of 77.4%. Some of the blacklisted keywords are present in the titles of some BitTorrent files, yet the associated announce requests are allowed. We did not find any content directly related to sensitive topics like "Syrian revolution" or "Arab spring," but we identified content related to anti-censorship software, such as UltraSurf (2,703 requests for all versions), HideMyAss (176 requests), Auto Hide IP (532 requests), and anonymous browsers (393 requests). Our findings suggest that P2P networks are used by users inside Syria to circumvent censorship to a certain extent. Additionally, BitTorrent is used to download Instant Messaging software, such as Skype, MSN messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger, which cannot be downloaded directly from official pages due to censorship.

### Google Cache

Google's search engine allows access to cached versions of suggested pages. While Google Cache is not intended as an anti-censorship tool, a simple analysis of the logs shows that it provides a way to access otherwise censored content.

We identified 4,860 requests accessing Google's cache on `webcache.googleusercontent.com` in the Dfull dataset. Only 12 of these requests were censored due to blacklisted keywords in the URL, and one request to retrieve a cached version of `http://ar-ar.facebook.com/SYRIANREVOLUTION.K.N.N` was denied, although it is not categorized as a "Blocked Site." The rest of the requests were allowed. Interestingly, some of the allowed requests relate to cached versions of webpages that are otherwise censored, such as `www.panet.co.il`, `aawsat.com`, `www.facebook.com/Syrian.Revolution`, and `www.free-syria.com`. While the use of Google cache to access censored content is limited in scope, the logs suggest it is very effective. When properly secured with HTTPS, Google cache could serve as a way to access censored content.

### Summary

The logs highlight that Syrian users resort to various censorship circumvention tools with relatively high effectiveness. While some tools and websites are monitored and blocked (e.g., Hotspot Shield), many others successfully bypass censorship. Our study also shows that tools not necessarily designed as circumvention tools, such as BitTorrent and Google cache, can provide additional ways to access censored content if proper precautions are taken, especially considering that Syrian ISPs started blocking Tor relays and bridges in December 2012.

### Discussion

#### Economics of Censorship
Our analysis shows that Syrian authorities deploy a range of techniques to filter internet traffic, from blocking entire subnets to filtering based on specific keywords. This range of techniques can be explained by the cost/benefit tradeoff of censorship. While censoring the majority of the Israeli network can be justified on geopolitical grounds, completely denying access to social networks like Facebook could generate unrest. For instance, during the "Arab Spring" uprisings, Syrian authorities decided to allow access to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube in February 2011, but these sites are still monitored and selectively censored. Censors aim for subtle control by denying access to a predefined set of websites and keywords. This shift is achievable as the proxy appliances support Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), allowing fine-grained censorship in real-time.

#### Censorship Targets
Censored traffic encompasses a wide variety of content, primarily aimed at preventing the use of Instant Messaging software (e.g., Skype), video sharing websites (e.g., metacafe.com, upload.youtube.com), Wikipedia, and news and opposition party sites (e.g., islammemo.cc, alquds.co.uk). Censors also block requests related to predefined anti-censorship tools (e.g., 'proxy'). This mechanism, however, has side effects, as it denies access to any page containing these keywords, including those unrelated to censorship circumvention.

#### Censorship Circumvention
Users attempt to circumvent censorship using various methods. One interesting approach is using BitTorrent to download anti-censorship tools like UltraSurf and Instant Messaging software. Users also rely on known censorship-evading technologies, such as web/socks proxies and Tor.

### Conclusion
This paper presents a measurement analysis of internet filtering in Syria, analyzing 600GB of logs from 7 Blue Coat SG-9000 proxies in Summer 2011. We provided a detailed snapshot of a real-world censorship ecosystem, uncovering a stealthy yet targeted filtering system that relies on IP addresses, domains, and keywords. Keyword-based censorship produces collateral damage, as many requests are blocked even if they do not relate to sensitive content. Finally, we showed that Instant Messaging software is heavily censored, that filtering of social media is limited to specific pages, and that Syrian users try to circumvent censorship using web/socks proxies, Tor, VPNs, and BitTorrent.
