Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-sift-through-text-with-
regular-expressions has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and
include links to screenshots if possible.
In the description, `/the+/gi` is used to search for all "the" and "The" in a
string. While stated differently, I would consider the `+` being part of the
pattern. As I understand it, the `+` will only affect the character or group
directly in front of it (as do `*`, `?` and `{}`), so in the example `e` (will
also match a "theeee"), which is probably not what the author wanted. Even
worse, the assertions want me to write `/and+/gi`, where `/and/gi` would be
sufficient and less misleading.
These extra plusses won't change anything if you just count matches, as these
words cannot overlap (example if they did: `"abaaba".match(/aba+/gi)` will
return only one match, `"abaaba".match(/aba/gi)` will return two), but might
change results if you evaluate the whole matches for example for total length.
I also do not quite agree with the description of the "g" flag, though I would
not call that false, just imprecise. I would describe it as "After finding a
pattern match, continue search after that match, so that the found patterns
cannot overlap" or similar, to make clear that without the "g" flag, only the
first match is returned.
