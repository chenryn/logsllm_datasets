### Issue Report: FreeCodeCamp jQuery Challenge

**Challenge URL:** http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-delete-your-jquery-functions

**Browser:** Chrome Version 44.0.2403.157  
**Operating System:** OS X 10.9.5

**Description:**
While working through the jQuery section, I encountered a few issues. Specifically, after inserting a new jQuery call, I received an "Unexpected token }" error message. This is somewhat expected, as I am actively modifying the script that runs on the page. However, this error occasionally causes the list of tasks to disappear. The only way to restore the task list is to click the "Reset My Code" button.

**Screenshots:**
