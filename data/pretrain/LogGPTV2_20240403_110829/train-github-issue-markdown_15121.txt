Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-delete-your-jquery-
functions has an issue.
Browser: Chrome Version 44.0.2403.157  
OS: OS X 10.9.5
While progressing through the jQuery section, I ran into a couple of errors.
After inserting a new jQuery call, I get an "Unexpected token }" message. This
is not totally unexpected I guess since I'm activity modifying script that
will run on the page. However, occasionally this will cause the list of tasks
to complete to disappear. The only way to make them reappear is to click reset
my code.

Here's a screen shot of the page without the tasks listed.
