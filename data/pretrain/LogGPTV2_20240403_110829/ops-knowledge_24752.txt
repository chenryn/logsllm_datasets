The provided system log contains 20 lines, each with a timestamp, log level, process ID, relevant software component, and the log content. Here is a step-by-step summary of the log chunk:

1. **Timestamp Range**: The logs span from 2015-08-24 19:01:14 to 2015-08-24 22:17:14.
2. **Log Levels**:
   - **WARN**: Indicates issues or potential problems.
   - **INFO**: Provides information about the system's state or actions.
3. **Relevant Software Components**:
   - **QuorumCnxManager**: Manages connections within the quorum.
   - **FastLeaderElection**: Manages the leader election process.

### Summary of Log Events

- **Repeated WARN Messages (QuorumCnxManager)**:
  - Multiple warnings are logged, indicating that the system cannot open a channel to node 2 at the election address `/10.10.34.12:3888`. These warnings occur at various times, including 19:01:14, 19:05:14, 19:09:14, 19:31:14, 20:01:14, 20:16:14, 20:56:14, 20:57:14, 21:26:14, 22:08:14, and 22:17:14.
  - There are also warnings about the inability to open a channel to node 3 at the election address `/10.10.34.13:3888` at 19:19:14, 21:07:14, 22:08:14, and 22:16:14.

- **INFO Messages (FastLeaderElection)**:
  - Notifications of time out (60000 milliseconds) for the FastLeaderElection process are logged at 19:45:14, 19:55:14, 21:11:14, 22:04:14, and 22:09:14.

### Key Observations
- **Connection Issues**: The system is consistently unable to open channels to nodes 2 and 3 at their respective election addresses. This suggests a persistent network or configuration issue.
- **Leader Election Timeouts**: The FastLeaderElection process is experiencing timeouts, which may be related to the connection issues. The repeated timeouts indicate that the leader election process is not completing successfully within the expected time frame.

### Conclusion
The log indicates ongoing connectivity issues with specific nodes in the quorum, leading to repeated warnings and timeouts in the leader election process. These issues need to be addressed to ensure the proper functioning of the system.
