User:  What factors need to be considered when deploying a highly available HAProxy on a group of servers? Please list at least five key points.
Assistant: 1. Load balancing strategy: Select a load balancing strategy suitable for business needs, such as round robin, IP hash, minimum number of connections, etc. 2. Health check: Set up a health check mechanism to ensure that only healthy servers respond to requests. Ports, URLs, response content, etc. can be inspected. 3. High availability: HAProxy clusters are used to ensure that when a node fails, other nodes can take over its services. 4. Security: Configure appropriate security policies to ensure that only legitimate clients can access the HAProxy server. 5. High performance: Optimize HAProxy configuration and kernel parameters to improve performance. Asynchronous I/O, caching, etc. can be used.
