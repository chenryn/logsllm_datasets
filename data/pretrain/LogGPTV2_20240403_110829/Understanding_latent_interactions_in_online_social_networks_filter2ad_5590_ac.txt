3. PROPERTIES OF INTERACTION EVENTS
Our work focuses on the analysis of latent interaction events and
the role they play in OSNs.
In our measurement of the Renren
OSN, we use histories of visits to user proﬁles to capture latent
interactions. In this section, we take a closer look at latent interac-
tions and compare them with visible interactions from a variety of
perspectives.
3.1 Popularity and Consumption
We begin by analyzing the distribution of latent interactions across
the Renren user-base. We deﬁne popularity as the number of views
a user’s proﬁle receives; this is equivalent to the user’s in-degree of
latent interactions. Figure 9 shows the distribution of user popular-
ity. As expected, popularity is not evenly spread across the popu-
lation: only 518 people (1%) are popular enough to receive more
than 10,000 views. Conversely, the majority of users (57%) exhibit
very low popularity with less than 100 total proﬁle views.
Figure 10 shows the average number of visits users receive on a
daily basis. The distribution is ﬁtted to a Zipf distribution of the
form βx−α where α = 0.71569687 and β = 697.4468225. Pop-
ular users receive many more views per day: 141 users (0.2%) are
viewed more than 20 times a day on average, with the most pop-
ular proﬁle being viewed more than 600 times a day. Most users
(85.5%) receive less than one visit per day on average. This rein-
forces our ﬁnding that latent interactions are highly skewed towards
a very popular subset of the population.
Finally, we examine whether the popularity of users corresponds
to their proﬁle viewing behavior. We deﬁne consumption as the
number of other proﬁles a user views; this is equivalent to the

Figure 13: PDF of interval time between repeat visits
Figure 15: Breakdown of visitors by owner’s social degree
user’s out-degree of latent interactions. Figure 11 plots the over-
lap between the top users sorted by popularity, and top users sorted
by consumption. The graph shows that the top 1% most popular
users have 9% overlap with the top 1% biggest consumers. These
users represent a hard-core contingent of social network users who
are extremely active. For the most part however, users with high
numbers of incoming latent interactions do not overlap with the
people generating those interactions, e.g. proﬁles of celebrities
are viewed by many users, but they are inactive in viewing oth-
ers’ pages. This necessarily means that many (presumably average,
low-degree) users actively visit others, but are not visited in return.
We examine the reciprocity of latent interactions in more detail in
Section 3.3.
3.2 Composition of Visitors
Next, we want to ﬁgure out the composition of visitors to user
proﬁles. We pose two questions: ﬁrst, what portion of proﬁle vis-
itors are repeat visitors? Second, are visitors mostly friends of the
proﬁle owner, or are they unrelated strangers?
We begin by addressing the ﬁrst question. We calculate the per-
centage of repeated visitors for each proﬁle, and report the distri-
bution in Figure 12. Roughly 70% of users have less than 50%
repeat visitors, meaning that the majority of visitors do not browse
the same proﬁle twice. This seems to indicate the long tail of la-
tent interactions is generated by users randomly browsing the social
graph.
Next, we take a closer look at repeat proﬁle visits. Figure 13
shows the probability density function (PDF) of the interval time
between repeat visits. The graph peaks on day 0, meaning that
users are most likely to return to a viewed proﬁle on the same day.
We will examine the causes for this behavior more closely in Sec-
tion 4. The probability for repeated views decreases as the time
delta expands, except for a noticeable peak at day 7. Interestingly,
this shows that many users periodically check on their friends on a
weekly basis. We conﬁrmed that this feature is not an artifact in-
troduced by our crawler or the use of RSS feeds by Renren users.
Instead, we believe it may be due to the tendency for many users to
browse their friends’ proﬁles over the weekend.
We now move on to our second question: what users are gener-
ating latent interactions, friends of the proﬁle owner, or strangers.
We deﬁne a stranger as any user who is not a direct friend of the
target user. Like Facebook, Renren’s default privacy settings allow
users in the same campus network to browse each other’s proﬁles.
Renren automatically recommends popular proﬁles to other users
in the same network, which motivates people to view non-friends’
proﬁles. However, they only recommend the 100 users in the net-
work with the most users. Thus this feature should have minimal
impact on our analysis of visitors to the average Renren user.
In order to answer our question, we calculate the percentage of
visitors that are strangers and display the results in Figure 14. The
results are fairly evenly divided: roughly 45% of users receive less
than 50% of their proﬁle visits from strangers. Or conversely, a
slight majority of the population does receive a majority of their
proﬁle views from strangers.
We want to take a closer look at what component of a proﬁle’s
visitors are strangers, and how far are they from the proﬁle owner
in the social graph. In Figure 15, we group the owners of proﬁles
together by their social degree, and compute the average break-
down of their visitors into users who are friends (1-hop), friends-of-
friends (2-hop) and other visitors (2+ hops). We see that for users
with relatively few (< 100) friends, the large majority of their vis-
itors are complete strangers, with very few friends-of-friends visit-

Figure 17: Ratio of reciprocated latent interactions over total
latent relationships
Figure 19: Distribution of total interactions
ing. For well-connected users with 100–1000 friends, the majority
of their visitors are direct friends, and also a signiﬁcant number of
friends-of-friends. Finally, for extremely popular users with more
than 1000 friends, their notoriety is such that they start to attract
more strangers to visit their proﬁles. These results conﬁrm those
from previous work that discovered many Orkut users browse pro-
ﬁles 2 or more hops away on the social graph [3].
Unlike friends, strangers do not build long-term relationships
with proﬁle owners. Intuitively, this would seem to indicate that
repeat proﬁle viewing behavior should favor friends over strangers.
To investigate this we compute the average number of visits for
strangers and friends for each proﬁle and plot the distribution in
Figure 16. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the repeat pro-
ﬁle viewing behavior for friends and strangers is very similar, with
friends only edging out strangers by a small margin. This result
demonstrates that when considering information dissemination via
latent interactions, the signiﬁcance of non-friend strangers should
not be overlooked.
3.3 Reciprocity
Social norms compel users to reply to one another when con-
tacted via visible interactions. Prior work has shown that these
interactions are largely reciprocal on OSNs [29]. However, is this
