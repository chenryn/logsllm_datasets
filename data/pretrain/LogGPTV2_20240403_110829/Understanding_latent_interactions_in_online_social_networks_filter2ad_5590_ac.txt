### 3. Properties of Interaction Events

Our work focuses on the analysis of latent interaction events and their role in Online Social Networks (OSNs). In our study of the Renren OSN, we use visit histories to user profiles to capture these latent interactions. This section delves into latent interactions, comparing them with visible interactions from various perspectives.

#### 3.1 Popularity and Consumption

We begin by analyzing the distribution of latent interactions across the Renren user base. We define popularity as the number of views a user’s profile receives, which is equivalent to the user's in-degree of latent interactions. Figure 9 shows the distribution of user popularity. As expected, popularity is not evenly distributed: only 518 people (1%) receive more than 10,000 views. Conversely, the majority of users (57%) have very low popularity, with fewer than 100 total profile views.

Figure 10 displays the average number of daily visits users receive. The distribution fits a Zipf distribution of the form \(\beta x^{-\alpha}\), where \(\alpha = 0.71569687\) and \(\beta = 697.4468225\). Popular users receive many more views per day: 141 users (0.2%) are viewed more than 20 times a day on average, with the most popular profile being viewed over 600 times a day. Most users (85.5%) receive less than one visit per day on average. This reinforces our finding that latent interactions are highly skewed towards a small, very popular subset of the population.

Finally, we examine whether the popularity of users corresponds to their profile viewing behavior. We define consumption as the number of other profiles a user views, which is equivalent to the user's out-degree of latent interactions. Figure 11 plots the overlap between the top users sorted by popularity and the top users sorted by consumption. The graph shows that the top 1% most popular users have a 9% overlap with the top 1% biggest consumers. These users represent a core group of extremely active social network users. For the most part, however, users with high numbers of incoming latent interactions do not overlap with those generating those interactions. For example, celebrity profiles are viewed by many users but are inactive in viewing others' pages. This means that many (presumably average, low-degree) users actively visit others but are not visited in return. We will examine the reciprocity of latent interactions in more detail in Section 3.3.

#### 3.2 Composition of Visitors

Next, we analyze the composition of visitors to user profiles. We pose two questions: first, what portion of profile visitors are repeat visitors? Second, are visitors mostly friends of the profile owner, or are they unrelated strangers?

To address the first question, we calculate the percentage of repeated visitors for each profile and report the distribution in Figure 12. Approximately 70% of users have less than 50% repeat visitors, indicating that the majority of visitors do not browse the same profile twice. This suggests that the long tail of latent interactions is generated by users randomly browsing the social graph.

Figure 13 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the interval time between repeat visits. The graph peaks on day 0, meaning users are most likely to return to a viewed profile on the same day. The probability for repeated views decreases as the time delta expands, except for a noticeable peak at day 7. This indicates that many users periodically check on their friends on a weekly basis. We confirmed that this feature is not an artifact introduced by our crawler or the use of RSS feeds by Renren users. Instead, it may be due to the tendency for many users to browse their friends' profiles over the weekend.

For the second question, we define a stranger as any user who is not a direct friend of the target user. Like Facebook, Renren's default privacy settings allow users in the same campus network to browse each other's profiles. Renren automatically recommends popular profiles to other users in the same network, which motivates people to view non-friends' profiles. However, they only recommend the 100 users in the network with the most users. Thus, this feature should have minimal impact on our analysis of visitors to the average Renren user.

To answer our question, we calculate the percentage of visitors that are strangers and display the results in Figure 14. The results are fairly evenly divided: roughly 45% of users receive less than 50% of their profile visits from strangers. Conversely, a slight majority of the population does receive a majority of their profile views from strangers.

To further investigate, we group the owners of profiles by their social degree and compute the average breakdown of their visitors into users who are friends (1-hop), friends-of-friends (2-hop), and other visitors (2+ hops). Figure 15 shows that for users with relatively few (< 100) friends, the large majority of their visitors are complete strangers, with very few friends-of-friends visiting. For well-connected users with 100–1000 friends, the majority of their visitors are direct friends, and a significant number are friends-of-friends. Finally, for extremely popular users with more than 1000 friends, their notoriety attracts more strangers to visit their profiles. These results confirm previous findings that many Orkut users browse profiles 2 or more hops away on the social graph [3].

Unlike friends, strangers do not build long-term relationships with profile owners. Intuitively, this would suggest that repeat profile viewing behavior should favor friends over strangers. To investigate this, we compute the average number of visits for strangers and friends for each profile and plot the distribution in Figure 16. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the repeat profile viewing behavior for friends and strangers is very similar, with friends only slightly edging out strangers. This result demonstrates that when considering information dissemination via latent interactions, the significance of non-friend strangers should not be overlooked.

#### 3.3 Reciprocity

Social norms compel users to reply to one another when contacted via visible interactions. Prior work has shown that these interactions are largely reciprocal on OSNs [29]. However, is this also true for latent interactions?
