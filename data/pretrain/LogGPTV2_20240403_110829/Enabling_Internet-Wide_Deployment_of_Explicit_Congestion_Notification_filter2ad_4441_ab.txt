**Abstract:**
The relatively high prevalence of permanent IPv6 connection failures (nearly 10%) indicates limited operational experience with IPv6. This document presents connectivity and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) negotiation statistics from a study conducted between August 27 and September 9, 2014, involving 581,737 IPv4 hosts and 17,029 IPv6 hosts.

**Connectivity Statistics (Table 1):**

|----------------|-------|----------------|-------|-----------------|
| 553,805        | 95.20 | 14,889         | 87.43 | Always connected from all vantage points |
| 3,998          | 0.69  | 1,594          | 9.36  | Never connected from any vantage point   |

- **Figure 2:** Proportion of sites failing to connect when ECN negotiation is requested.

**Key Observations:**
- **Potential ECN Dependency:** Some hosts exhibit potential ECN dependency, where no connection attempt requesting ECN succeeds from one vantage point, but at least one connection attempt with ECN from another vantage point succeeds. However, transient connectivity effects cannot be ruled out.
- **Time-Dependent Anomalies:** 201 cases for IPv4 showed ECN-independent connectivity during one trial but ECN-dependent during another, likely due to changes in network or host configuration.
- **Inconclusive Cases:** 862 cases for IPv4 and 69 for IPv6 could not be definitively classified as either ECN-dependent or transient, leading to an estimated upper-bound "blackhole" rate of 0.57% for IPv4 and 0.50% for IPv6, comparable to previous studies.

**Operating System Impact:**
- **TTL Analysis:** Sites with initial TTL 64 (Linux) and 128 (Windows) are equally represented among hosts exhibiting ECN-dependent connectivity, while Linux servers are more common among ECN-independent hosts.
- **Website Rank Impact:** Up to 2% of websites with an Alexa rank between 50,000 and 55,000 fail to connect when ECN is requested, compared to a background rate of about 0.5%.

**RFC 3168 Fallback Testing:**
- **Patch Application:** Applying the RFC3168 ECN fallback Linux patch to a single Ubuntu 14.04 machine running the 3.13 kernel eliminated connection failures attributable to ECN, at the cost of increased connection setup latency.
- **Conclusion:** Implementing ECN fallback as the default behavior in all operating systems will restore connectivity and is crucial for wide-scale deployment of ECN.

**ECN Negotiation Statistics (Table 2):**

| 6,177          | 0.35  | 83             | 0.48  | -          | -          | ...and reflect syn ack flags |
| 1,929          | 11.33 | -              | -     | -          | -          | Never connect with ECN (see Sect. 3.1) |

**Key Findings:**
- **ECN Capability:** The majority of top million web servers (56.17% for IPv4, 65.41% for IPv6) are now capable of negotiating ECN, continuing a linear trend since 2008.
- **OS Differences:** Almost no initial-TTL 128 (Windows) or 255 (Solaris; also Google) hosts negotiate ECN. Among initial-TTL 64 (Linux) hosts, 69.73% are ECN capable.
- **Rank Impact:** The highest-ranked website that will negotiate ECN has a rank of 6 (www.wikipedia.org). Higher-ranked websites generally use custom networking software and are less likely to support ECN by default.

**IP Signaling Anomalies (Tables 3 and 4):**
- **Expected Signaling:** 97.2% of IPv4 hosts and 80.9% of IPv6 hosts that always negotiate ECN mark all subsequent packets ect(0), indicating expected signaling.
- **Anomalies:** 2.1% of IPv4 and 18.1% of IPv6 hosts that always negotiate ECN never send an ect marked packet, possibly due to middlebox interference.
- **Mangling Indicators:** 1,995 IPv4 hosts do not negotiate ECN but send ect(0) marked packets, indicating potential mangling or broken TCP stacks.

**Conclusion:**
Enabling ECN by default would lead to additional setup latency for about five websites per thousand, which is significantly fewer than the forty per thousand experiencing transient or permanent connection failures due to other operational issues. The implementation of ECN fallback as the default behavior in all operating systems is essential for wide-scale ECN deployment.
