User: I have a directory which hosts all of my Django apps (C:\My_Projects). I want to add this directory to my PYTHONPATH so I can call the apps directly.
I tried adding C:\My_Projects\; to my Windows Path variable from the Windows GUI (My Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables). But it still doesn't read the coltrane module and generates this error:

Error: No module named coltrane
Assistant: Just append your installation path (ex. C:\Python27\) to the PATH variable in System variables. Then close and open your command line and type 'python'.
