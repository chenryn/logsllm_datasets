To add your Django apps directory (C:\My_Projects) to the `PYTHONPATH`, follow these steps:

1. **Open Environment Variables:**
   - Right-click on 'This PC' or 'Computer' on the desktop or in File Explorer.
   - Select 'Properties'.
   - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
   - In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.

2. **Edit the `PYTHONPATH` Variable:**
   - In the Environment Variables window, under the 'System variables' section, look for the `PYTHONPATH` variable. If it does not exist, you will need to create it.
   - To create a new `PYTHONPATH` variable:
     - Click 'New...' and enter `PYTHONPATH` as the variable name.
     - Enter `C:\My_Projects` as the variable value.
   - If the `PYTHONPATH` variable already exists:
     - Select `PYTHONPATH` and click 'Edit...'.
     - Append `;C:\My_Projects` to the end of the existing value. Ensure that there is a semicolon (`;`) separating the new path from any existing paths.

3. **Save and Close:**
   - Click 'OK' to close all the windows and save your changes.

4. **Verify the Change:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window.
   - Type `python` and press Enter to start the Python interpreter.
   - Import one of your Django apps to verify that the `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly. For example, if `coltrane` is one of your apps, you can try:
     ```python
     import coltrane
     ```

If you still encounter the error `No module named coltrane`, ensure that the `coltrane` module is located in the `C:\My_Projects` directory and that the directory structure is correct. Additionally, make sure that the `__init__.py` file is present in the `coltrane` directory to mark it as a Python package.

If the issue persists, you may want to check the following:
- Verify that the `PYTHONPATH` is correctly set by running `echo %PYTHONPATH%` in the Command Prompt.
- Ensure that the Python version you are using is compatible with your Django apps.
- Check for any typos or case sensitivity issues in the module name.

By following these steps, you should be able to add your Django apps directory to the `PYTHONPATH` and resolve the `No module named coltrane` error.
