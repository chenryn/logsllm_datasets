User: Might the esteemed os.system of Python fame throw an exception? If so, which ones?
Assistant: os.system throws a TypeError if there is not exactly one string argument. If the fork fails due to resource or ulimit restrictions, it will return -1. If the argument is not valid in some way (like non-existing command), it will return a high error code. Apart from the aforementioned TypeError, os.system does not throw any exceptions.
