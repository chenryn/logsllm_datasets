### Data Analysis

We analyzed the ordinal data using the Kruskal-Wallis H test (KW) for omnibus comparisons. For two-group comparisons, we used the Mann-Whitney U Test (U), which is the KW's equivalent. We conducted seven planned contrasts between condition pairs: comparing Longitudinal:Interests to each of the other five conditions, and comparing both Current:Connections and Current:Trackers to Control:Static. To minimize Type II error, we applied Holm correction within each set of contrasts and across each set of omnibus tests.

Similarly, we analyzed System Usability Scale (SUS) data and participants' estimates of tracking, treating the data as continuous. Many questions were asked both pre- and post-usage, eliciting responses on scales. To understand how these responses changed over time, both overall and by condition, we built repeated-measures ordinal logistic regression models. The dependent variable (DV) was the response, and the independent variables (IVs) included the time period (pre-, post-usage), condition, and the interaction between the two. We performed Holm correction within each set of questions.

For the two Information Privacy Concerns (IUIPC) sub-scales, we summed the responses across scale items and analyzed these continuous sums using a repeated-measures ANOVA.

### Qualitative Analysis

We analyzed free-response data through qualitative open coding. One member of the research team read the responses and created a codebook with thematic codes, updating it iteratively as necessary. Each survey question had its own set of 7 or 8 unique, but not mutually exclusive, codes. A second researcher independently coded the full set of data. Inter-coder reliability, measured with Cohen’s κ, ranged from 0.76 to 0.82 per question, with a median of 0.80. This level of agreement is considered "substantial" [47] or "excellent" [33].

### Limitations

To limit self-selection by particularly privacy-interested participants, we advertised our study as “evaluating a web browser visualization tool” without mentioning privacy, though we did mention tracking as part of the procedures. However, there may have been contradictory self-selection, where privacy-conscious individuals might have been unwilling to install an unknown extension and thus declined participation. Additionally, Mechanical Turk (MTurk) participants are generally younger, more technically savvy, and more privacy-sensitive than the general U.S. population [42]. This is evident in our results, which show high initial levels of knowledge about tracking. We believe these limitations are acceptable, as our tool targets people interested in learning more about online tracking and privacy. Furthermore, less-aware populations may benefit even more from visualizations like ours.

In any online study, participants may not answer carefully, and some may try to participate multiple times. We followed best practices [68], using high-reputation workers and forbidding multiple submissions from one MTurk account. In addition to participants' high initial privacy literacy, the phrasing of our questions may have contributed to the ceiling effect in some of our results.

We were only able to survey Chrome and Firefox users, which are the two most popular desktop browsers [85]. Our extension only detects third-party tracking in desktop browsing; the mobile tracking/ad ecosystem is significantly different. The extension does not account for cross-browser or cross-device tracking [13, 15, 104]. Our simulation of inferences based on a user’s browsing history is an approximation of what advertising networks may actually be doing. While this is a limitation, advertising networks do not provide consumers or researchers access to actual data mapping precise browsing activities to specific inferences. Despite these imperfections, our methods are one of the few ways to evaluate users’ reactions to inference-level information.

Detecting trackers via web requests may result in false positives for non-tracking-related requests, but it captures many types of tracking, including cookie storage and access, as well as fingerprinting. Other blocking tools installed by users may block requests to trackers, preventing our extension from detecting them. However, this would accurately reflect the extent to which the user is actually tracked. We detected whether participants had blocking tools installed and found a slight decrease in the number of trackers detected for those users. Finally, our qualitative results indicated that some participants in the Control:Static condition may have realized they were in a control condition, but a control was necessary for comparisons across conditions.

Given ongoing escalations between ad-blockers and advertisers [41], and the potential for fingerprinting browser extensions [37, 83], it is possible that sites could identify and retaliate against future tools like Tracking Transparency. Sites could manipulate the text parsed by the topic modeling algorithm or otherwise try to avoid classification. As we used Tracking Transparency with a small population during a short experiment, it seems unlikely that we provoked such retaliation. Any widely deployed tool employing a similar mechanism would need to defend against adversarial scenarios.

### Field Study Results

In this section, we present the results from our field study assessing how the Tracking Transparency interface affects user attitudes. We begin by characterizing our participants and their usage of the extension (Section 5.1). We then present a qualitative analysis of participants’ reactions to the information presented by Tracking Transparency (Section 5.2). Participants were surprised by the extent of tracking and learned how trackers infer their interests. Section 5.3 describes how using the extension increased participants' intentions to take privacy-protective actions, with conditions displaying more information seeing larger increases in intentions. We briefly discuss how the extension did not significantly impact participants' knowledge of targeted advertising (Section 5.4), which was mostly correct to begin with, or their broad attitudes about the practice (Section 5.5). Table 4 in the appendix provides the full statistical results. Finally, Section 5.6 describes how longitudinal information helped participants more accurately quantify tracking.

#### Participants and Usage

**Demographics:** A total of 456 participants completed the study. We excluded the 6.8% who visited fewer than 100 web pages, leaving 425 participants. Conditions were randomly assigned, resulting in the following distribution: 71 in Control:Static, 82 in Control:Browsing Only, 63 in Current:Trackers, 70 in Current:Connections, 66 in Longitudinal:Trackers, and 73 in Longitudinal:Interests. Of the participants, 52.2% identified as female, 46.8% as male, and 1.0% as non-binary. Most (72.2%) were 25–44 years old; 7.8% were under 25, and 20.0% were 45+. Educational backgrounds varied, with 40.5% having bachelor’s degrees, 35.3% having some college, 9.6% having graduate degrees, and 14.6% having high school diplomas. Additionally, 23.1% reported holding a degree or job related to IT or CS.

**Browser Usage:** Most (89.9%) participants installed the Tracking Transparency extension on Google Chrome, while 10.1% used Firefox. Participants estimated that a median of 80% of their browsing was on the device and browser where the extension was installed. Just under half (48.5%) of participants reported current use of an ad- or tracker-blocking tool, and an additional 18.6% reported past use. However, only 8.5% reported current use of a dedicated tracker-blocking tool (Ghostery, Privacy Badger, Firefox Tracking Protection, and Disconnect, in order of frequency). Our extension checked for the presence of other blocking tools, finding that 39% of participants had such a tool. A minority of participants reported having viewed ad preferences pages on Facebook (37.4%) and Google (28.9%), and only 7.5% recognized the AdChoices icon that indicates targeted ads [51].

Over the week-long study, our 425 participants visited a total of 1,068,302 web pages and encountered 533 different trackers. The top trackers observed were Amazon (present on 64.2% of pages), Google (47.0%), Facebook (10.1%), comScore (6.4%), and Microsoft (4.5%). Our extension detected an average of 2.58 trackers per page for users with no other blocking tools installed, and an average of 2.15 trackers for those with a blocking tool installed. Most of the 533 trackers were only observed on a small fraction of pages visited, demonstrating a long-tailed distribution consistent with large-scale measurements by Engelhardt et al.’s OpenWPM tool [27].

The Tracking Transparency inferencing approximation layer (Section 3.3) assigned a total of 230 unique interest categories across participants. The median participant was assigned 59 interest categories (mean = 58.6, standard deviation = 16.8) that the extension guessed might be inferrable from the participant’s page visits. The five most frequent categories were “Travel,” “News,” “Shopping,” “Books & Literature,” and “Online Communities.” All 425 participants had at least one page assigned the “Travel” topic. There was a long tail of topics assigned, including relatively obscure and infrequently assigned categories like “Medical Literature & Resources.” In total, 58 of the 230 interest categories were assigned to at least 10% of participants.
