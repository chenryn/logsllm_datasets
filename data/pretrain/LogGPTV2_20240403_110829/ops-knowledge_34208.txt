User: When developing macros in python for LibreOffice / OpenOffice on Linux at least, I've read that you have to place your py scripts in a particular directory.  
Is there a preferred method among Python LibreOffice/OOo developers for deploying these scripts, or is there another way to specify within LibreOffice/OOo to specify where you want these scripts to be?
Assistant: Maybe a nice way to go is to get familiarized with Python setup tools itself (http://packages.python.org/an_example_pypi_project/setuptools.html), and write a proper setup.py script which would place all needed files in the appropriate dirs.
Your macros could them even be installable with the "easy_install" Python framework
