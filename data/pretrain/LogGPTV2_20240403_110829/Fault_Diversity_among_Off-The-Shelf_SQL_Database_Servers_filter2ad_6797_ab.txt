### Dialect-Specific Bugs and Reproducibility Issues

Dialect-specific bugs are those that can only occur in a server with a specific extension. For instance, Interbase bug 217138 [8] involves the use of the UNION operator in views, a feature not supported by PostgreSQL 7.0.0. Consequently, this bug cannot be reproduced in PostgreSQL, making it a dialect-specific issue.

Another reproducibility concern arises when a bug script does not cause a failure in the server for which it was reported. We refer to these as Heisenbugs, borrowing from Gray’s terminology [10]. Our plan is to re-run these Heisenbugs in a more stressful, simulated environment [21], involving multiple clients and a high volume of transactions, to determine if repeated trials will produce incorrect results.

### Quantitative Results

#### Detailed Results

In total, our study included 181 bug reports: 55 for Interbase, 57 for PostgreSQL, 51 for MSSQL, and 18 for Oracle. Out of these 181 bugs, 76 were dialect-specific (only reproducible on one of the four servers), 47 could be run on all four servers, 26 could be run on only two servers, and 32 could be run on only three servers.

Each bug was first executed on the server for which it was reported. After translating the script into the SQL dialect of the respective server, it was then run on the other servers. The bugs were classified into dialect-specific and non-dialect-specific categories. Non-dialect-specific bugs were further categorized as Bohrbugs or Heisenbugs, as previously explained. Failures were also classified based on their effects, as different failure types require different recovery mechanisms:

- **Engine Crash Failures**: Crashes or halts of the core engine.
- **Incorrect Result Failures**: Incorrect outputs without engine crashes, where the outputs do not conform to the server’s specification or the SQL standard.
- **Performance Failures**: Correct output but with an unacceptable time penalty for the particular input.
- **Other Failures**.

We also classified failures based on their detectability by a client of the database servers:

- **Self-Evident Failures**: Engine crash failures, cases where the server signals an internal failure as an exception (error message), and performance failures.
- **Non-Self-Evident Failures**: Incorrect result failures without server exceptions within an accepted time delay.

Table 1 summarizes the results of this step of the study. Each grey column lists the results produced when the bugs reported for a certain server were run on that server. For example, we collected 55 known Interbase bugs, of which 8 did not cause failures (possible Heisenbugs) when run on our Interbase server installation. The 47 bugs that caused failures are further classified in the part of the column below the double vertical lines, after the “Failure observed” row. All performance failures and engine crashes are self-evident, while incorrect result and other failures can be self-evident or non-self-evident depending on whether the server provides an error message.

The three columns to the right of the grey one present the results of running the Interbase bugs on the other three servers. For example, 23 of the Interbase bugs cannot be run in PostgreSQL (dialect-specific bugs). The "require further work" category indicates that we have not yet managed to translate the bug script into the PostgreSQL dialect of SQL, or they are listed as performance bugs but we could not determine if performance improves by changing servers. We plan to resolve this uncertainty using a testing infrastructure [21] to measure the precise execution times of the queries.

Out of 55 Interbase bugs, we managed to run 27 in PostgreSQL; only one caused a failure in both Interbase and PostgreSQL, which was a non-self-evident incorrect result, as shown in the table.

Regarding failure types, most of the bugs caused incorrect result failures, which will be discussed further in Section 6.

We observed a higher number of Heisenbugs in MSSQL and Oracle compared to the other servers. This was documented in some bug reports, which indicated: “may cause a failure.”
