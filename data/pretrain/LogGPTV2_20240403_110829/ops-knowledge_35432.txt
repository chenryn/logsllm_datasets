User: I'm new with python, I've been learning for a few weeks. However now I've just changed my OS and I'm now using ubuntu and I can't run any script on my terminal. 
I made sure to have the #!/usr/bin/env python
but when I go to the terminal and type, for example python test.py
the terminal shows an error message like this 

python: can't open file 'test.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory  

what do I do?
I must save the file in any specific folder to make it run on terminal?
Assistant: First create the file you want, with any editor like vi r gedit. And save with. Py extension.In that the first line should be
!/usr/bin/env python
