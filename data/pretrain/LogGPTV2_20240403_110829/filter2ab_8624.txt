**ATT&CK ID:** S0674  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** CharmPower

**Description:**
CharmPower is capable of changing its command and control (C2) channel every 360 loops by retrieving a new domain from the threat actor's S3 bucket. [10]

This periodic change in the C2 channel enhances the malware's resilience and evasiveness, making it more difficult for defenders to track and disrupt its operations.
