User: Under Linux, how to configure a disk file system so that it can support a block size of 4K bytes? Please give the operation steps and configuration parameters.
Assistant: Under Linux, to configure a disk file system that supports a block size of 4K bytes, you can use the ext4 file system. The specific operation steps are as follows: 1. Use the fdisk command or other partition tools to partition the disk. For example: fdisk /dev/sdb 2. Format the partition and create an ext4 file system. For example: mkfs.ext4 -b 4096 /dev/sdb1 3. Mount the newly created file system. For example: mkdir /mnt/mydisk && mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydisk 4. Edit the /etc/fstab file so that the file system is automatically mounted when the system starts. For example: echo "/dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydisk ext4 defaults 0 2" >> /etc/fstab Among them, -b 4096 is used to specify the block size is 4K bytes, /dev/sdb1 is the partition name of the file system to be created , /mnt/mydisk is the name of the folder to mount. The default configuration parameters can support 4K byte block size, so an ext4 file system that supports 4K block size can also be created without adding parameters.
