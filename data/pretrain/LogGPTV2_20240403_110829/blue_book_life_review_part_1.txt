Reviews are proceses to stop your daily life and do an introspection on how you feel and adjust your path. 
# Thoughts on the reviews themselves
## Keep It Simple 
It's important for the process to be light enough that you want to actually do it, so you see it as a help instead of a burden. It's always better to do a small and quick review rather than nothing at all. At the start of the review analyze yourself to assess how much energy do you have and decide which steps of the review you want to do.
## Review approaches
In the past I used the [life logging](life_logging.md) tools to analyze the past in order to understand what I achieved and take it as a base to learn from my mistakes. It was useful when I needed the endorphines boost of seeing all the progress done. Once I assumed that progress speed and understood that we always do the best we can given how we are, I started to feel that the review process was too cumbersome and that it was holding me into the past.
Nowadays I try not to look back but forward, analyze the present: how I feel, how's the environment around me, and how can I tweak both to fulfill my life goals. This approach leads to less reviewing of achievements and logs and more introspection, thinking and imagining. Which although may be slower to correct mistakes of the past, will surely make you live closer to the utopy.
The reviews below then follow that second approach.
## Personal alive reviews
Reviews have to reflect ourselves, and we change continuously, so take for granted that your review is going to change.
I've gone for full blown reviews of locking myself up for a week to not doing reviews for months. 
This article represent the guidelines I follow to do my life review. It may
seem a lot to you or may be very simple. Please take it as a base or maybe to
get some ideas and then create your own that fits your needs.
## Reviews as deadlines
Reviews can also be used as deadlines. Sometimes deadlines helps us get motivation and energy to achieve what we want if we feel low. But remember not to push yourself too hard. If deadlines do you more wrong than right, don't use them. All these tools are meant to help us, not to bring us down.
# Types of reviews
As [plannings](life_planning.md), reviews can be done at different levels of abstraction, each level gives you different benefits.
- [Weekly review](#weekly-review)
- [Month review](#month-review)
- [Trimester review](#trimester-review)
- [Year review](#year-review)
# Weekly review
I currently don't do any review process at weekly level. I want to specially after reading the [gtd](gtd.md) book, but I haven't found how and when. For sure I've sketched some ideas but often skip the opportunity to do it.
# Month review
The objectives of the month review are:
- Help you stop and analyze how you feel and what worries you.
- Transform the abstract guidelines of your life path to actionable elements.
The objectives aren't to:
- Assess the progress in your objectives and decisions
It's interesting to do the reviews on meaningful days such as the last one of the month. Usually we don't have enough flexibility in our life to do it exactly that day, so schedule it the closest you can to that date. It's a good idea to do both the review and the planning on the same day.
As it's a process we're going to do very often, we need it to be relatively quick and easy so as not to invest too much time or energies on it. Keep in mind that this should be an analysis at month level in terms of abstraction, here is not the place to ask yourself if you're fulfilling your life goals. As such, you don't need that much time either, just identifying the top things that pop out of your mind are more than enough.
## Month review tools
With a new level of abstraction we need tools:
- The *Review box*: It's the place you leave notes for yourself when you do the review, it can be for example a physical folder or a computer text file. I use a file called `review_box.org`. It's filled after the refile of review elements captured in the rest of my inboxes.
- The *Month checks*: It's a list of elements you want to periodically check its evolution throughout time. It's useful to analyze the validity of theories or new processes. I use the heading `Month checks` in a file called `life_checks.org`.
- The *Objective list*: It's a list of elements you want to focus your energies on. It should be easy to consult. I started with a list per month in a file called `objectives.org` and then migrated to the [life path document](#the-life-path-document).
## Month review phases
We'll divide the review process in these phases:
- Prepare
- Discover 
- Analyze 
- Decide 
To record the results of the review create the file `references/reviews/YYYY_MM.org`, where the month is the one that is ending with the following template:
```org
* Discover
* Analyze
* Decide
```
### Month prepare
It's important that you prepare your environment for the review. You need to be present and fully focused on the process itself. To do so you can:
- Make sure you don't get interrupted: 
    - Check your task manager tools to make sure that you don't have anything urgent to address in the next hour.
    - Disable all notifications
- Set your analysis environment:
    - Put on the music that helps you get *in the zone*. I found it meaningful to select the best new music I've discovered this month.
    - Get all the things you may need for the review:
        - The checklist that defines the process of your review (this document in my case).
        - Somewhere to write down the insights.
        - Your *Review box.
        - Your *Month checks*.
        - Your *Objective list*.
    - Remove from your environment everything else that may distract you
        - Close all windows in your laptop that you're not going to use
### Month Discover
Try not to, but if you think of decisions you want to make that address the elements you're discovering, write them down in the `Decide` section of your review document.
There are different paths to discover actionable items:
- Analyze what is in your mind: Take 10 minutes to answer to the next questions (you don't need to answer them all):
  - What did drain your energy or brought you down emotionally this last month?
  - What worries you right now?
  - What did help you most this last month?
  - What did you enjoy most this last month?
  Notice that we do not need to review our life logging tools (diary, task manager, ...) to answer these questions. This means that we're doing an analysis of what is in our minds right now, not throughout the month. It's flawed but as we do this analysis often, it's probably fine. We add more importance to the latest events in our life anyway.
- Empty the elements you added to the `review box`.
- Process your `Month checks`. For each of them:
  - Think of whether you've met the check. 
  - If you need, add action elements in the `Discover` section of the review.
- Process your `Month objectives`. For each of them:
  - Think of whether you've met the objective. 
  - If you need, add action elements in the `Discover` section of the review.
  - If you won't need the objective in the next month, archive it.
### Analyze
Of all the identified elements we need to understand them better to be able to choose the right path to address them. These elements are usually representations of a state of our lives that we want to change.
- For each of them if you can think of an immediate solution to address the element add it to the `Decide` section otherwise add them to the `Analyze`. 
- Order the elements in `Analyze` in order of priority
Then allocate 20 minutes to think about them. Go from top to bottom transitioning once you feel it's analyzed enough. You may not have time to analyze all of them. That's fine. Answering the next questions may help you:
- What defines the state we want to change? 
- What are the underlying forces in your life that made you reach that state?
- To what state you want to transition to?
- What is the easiest way to reach that destination? 
For the last question you can resort to:
- Habits change
- Projects change: start or stop doing a series of tasks.
- Roadmap change
Once you have analyzed an element copy all the decisions you've made in the `Decide` section of your review document.
### Decide
Once you have a clear definition of the current state, the new and how to reach it you need to process each of the decisions you've identified through the review process so that they are represented in your life management system, otherwise you won't arrive the desired state. To do so analyze what is the best way to process each of the elements you have written in the `Decide` section. It can be one or many of the following:
- Create or tweak a habit
- Tweak your project and tasks definitions
- Create *checks* to make sure that they are not overseen. 
- Create objectives that will be checked in the next reviews (weekly and monthly).
- Create [Anki](anki.md) cards to keep the idea in your mind.
# Trimester review
The objectives of the trimester review are:
- Adjust your life path
- Identify the philosophical topics of your life to address
- Identify the interesting topics to learn
The objectives are not:
- To review what you've done or why you didn't get there.
## When to do the trimester reviews
As with [moth reviews](#month-review), it's interesting to do analysis at representative moments. It gives it an emotional weight. You can for example use the solstices or my personal version of the solstices:
- Spring analysis (1st of March): For me the spring is the real start of the year, it's when life explodes after the stillness of the winter. The sun starts to set later enough so that you have light in the afternoons, the climate gets warmer thus inviting you to be more outside, the nature is blooming new leaves and flowers. It is then a moment to build new projects and set the current year on track. 
- Summer analysis (1st of June): I hate heat, so summer is a moment of retreat. Everyone temporarily stop their lives, we go on holidays and all social projects slow their pace. Even the news have even less interesting things to report. It's so hot outside that some of us seek the cold refuge of home or remote holiday places. Days are long and people love to hang out till late, so usually you wake up later, thus having less time to actually do stuff. Even in the moments when you are alone the heat drains your energy to be productive. It is then a moment to relax and gather forces for the next trimester. It's also perfect to develop *easy* and *chill* personal projects that have been forgotten in a drawer. Lower your expectations and just flow with what your body asks you.
- Autumn analysis (1st of September): September it's another key moment for many people. We have it hardcoded in our life since we were children as it was the start of school. People feel energized after the summer holidays and are eager to get back to their lives and stopped projects. You're already 6 months into the year, so it's a good moment to review your year plan and decide how you want to invest your energy reserves.
- Winter analysis (1st of December): December is the cue that the year is coming to an end. The days grow shorter and colder, they basically invite you to enjoy a cup of tea under a blanket. It is then a good time to get into your cave and do an introspection analysis on the whole year and prepare the ground for the coming year. Some of the goals of this season are:
