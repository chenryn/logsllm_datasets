### Title: Organizing Large-Scale DDoS Exercises in the Netherlands

In January 2018, the Netherlands experienced a significant surge in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, highlighting the need for a more robust and coordinated defense strategy. In response, we established the Dutch Anti-DDoS Coalition, a national, voluntary consortium comprising seventeen organizations from various sectors, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs), banks, internet exchanges, non-profit DDoS scrubbing centers, government agencies, and the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration.

Despite their diverse backgrounds, these coalition members share a common goal: to enhance the resilience of Dutch online services by collaboratively combating DDoS attacks. The coalition's unique approach leverages a combination of complementary collaborative capabilities:

1. **Shared Expertise and Experience:** Coalition members pool their knowledge and experiences to develop best practices.
2. **Data Sharing:** We exchange metrics and characteristic properties of DDoS attacks to better understand and mitigate them.
3. **Joint Exercises:** We conduct large-scale DDoS exercises to test and improve our collective defenses.
4. **Public Information:** We provide the public with information about DDoS attacks and how to protect against them.
5. **Promotion of Security Standards:** We advocate for and implement security standards that help protect against DDoS attacks.

Our initial focus is on "critical" service providers, with plans to expand to include other organizations in subsequent phases.

During the presentation, we will introduce the Dutch Anti-DDoS Coalition and its various working groups. One of these groups is responsible for organizing large-scale DDoS exercises. This working group conducts biannual DDoS exercises in a RED/BLUE team setting, with the goal of transitioning to a PURPLE team environment. These exercises are designed to simulate real-world DDoS attacks, allowing participants to test and refine their defensive strategies.

We will delve into the technical, organizational, and legal aspects of organizing such exercises, providing insights into the challenges and benefits of this collaborative approach.
