Figure 4. RoleVAT results on small data from an enterprise domain
each of the two major user groups tendencies and one for
the remaining users. However, given the small size of the
permission data, partitioning may not be necessary.
Results of RoleVAT on data from the large enterprise
domain are in Figure 5. Once again, it can be seen that
there are clear role and user group tendencies. In both
Figure 5(a) and Figure 5(b), a large proportion of the image
is white pixels, making the dark clusters along the diagonal
very prominent. Even though this dataset contains over 400
times more permissions and over 30 times more users than
small enterprise data, distinct permission and user groupings
can be clearly identiﬁed. Larger datasets can produce more
distinct roles. In these organisations, more users have the
same job functionalities and permissions. This produces role
tendencies that are more deﬁned.
Figure 5(a) shows results of RoleVAT on permission
tendency. There are two permission clusters of signiﬁcant
size with several roles of smaller size. The two largest roles
are the permissions assigned to the most number of similar
people, or the most frequently assigned roles. Due to the
quantity of the roles, it is difﬁcult to visually identify all
237 role clusters individually.
RoleVAT for user groupings using the large enterprise data
can be found in Figure 5(b). Given this result, partitioning
on the data with minimal effect on role engineering results
is possible. The two prominent solid dark squares in the
ﬁgure each represent user permission assignments that can
separated as a data partition. It may also be possible to
separate the slightly correlated user cluster in the top left
corner of the image. Due to the size of the large enterprise
data, partitions may be required for role mining techniques
to produce results in acceptable times.
Finally, RoleVAT was tested with data created using
Zhang et al.’s data generator for role engineering testing [25].
The data generator randomly assigns permissions to roles
and roles to users using a Gaussian distribution given the
number of users, roles and permissions, and the average
and standard deviation for number of permissions per role
and roles per user. For our testing, data with 500 users and
500 permissions with 10 roles was generated. Each user was
assigned an average of 3 roles with 1 role standard deviation
and each role had an average of 50 permissions with a 10
permission standard deviation. The roles were removed and
direct user permission data was analysed. Figure 6 shows the
results on the synthetically generated data, and once again,
the user and permission tendencies are clear.
Figure 6(a) shows the RoleVAT result of permission
tendency analysis. In this image, 10 prominent dark squares
are visible along the diagonal, each representing one of the
10 roles from the original data. There are also signiﬁcantly
smaller squares along the diagonal, created due to the
random nature of the data generation process.
Zhang et al.’s data generator also allows for data par-
titioning. Figure 6(b) shows RoleVAT on users that have
been separated into 3 partitions. The 3 user partitions can
distinctively be identiﬁed along the diagonals of this image.
RoleVAT required less (often signiﬁcantly less) than 2
minutes to complete on all datasets. RoleVAT on the largest
dataset required less than 100 seconds to analyse the ten-
dency of 10 378 permissions. These are exceptional runtimes
given the intractability of the role mining problem. Analysis
into the break down of the times show the majority of
processing time is spent on reordering the dissimilarity
matrix when datasets are small and majority of the pro-
cessing time is required to generate dissimilarities of users
or permission sets when datasets are large. For example,

V. DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Existing role engineering tools cluster similar permission
assignments to form roles. An important ﬁrst step in data
mining that
is currently lacking in existing role mining
techniques is cluster tendency analysis. Tendency analysis
does not identify actual clusters, rather the existence of
clusters. In relation to role engineering, tendency analysis is
the conﬁrmation of role existence. To address this issue, this
research proposes RoleVAT, a preprocessing tool to establish
practical need for RBAC through visualisation of user and
permission tendency.
Experimental results show RoleVAT to be effective; anal-
ysis of computed intensity images immediately reveal the
existence or lack of RBAC capabilities. There is a signiﬁcant
difference between images produced from systems without
RBAC in comparison to systems with RBAC. In permission
assignment data from enterprises without RBAC, resultant
RoleVAT images show limited cluster tendencies along

the diagonal (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Given compliance
and separation of duty constraints are beneﬁts of RBAC,
roles may still be desirable. However, role mining for the
identiﬁcation or roles are not expected to yield good results.
In enterprises suitable for RBAC, organisational units and
roles can be visualised. RoleVAT on permission assignment
data from enterprises with RBAC shows distinctive permis-
sion and user clusters in the form of dark square pixels along
the diagonal of the image (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6).
This can be used for identiﬁcation of user and permission
groups as well as an indication of an organisation’s RBAC
health.
The size and intensity also provides information about the
signiﬁcance of the cluster. A dark square represents strong
similarity between permissions or users in the cluster. A
large square represents a role or a user group that contains
many items. The count, or size of the cluster has often been
used as a measure of role cost [4], [8].
Results from RoleVAT can improve with the size of the
organisation. Both Figure 4 and Figure 5 contain access
control data from real enterprise domains with RBAC im-
plemented. While strong cluster tendencies can be identiﬁed
in both datasets, the results from the large enterprise data in
Figure 5 show clearer cluster tendencies with crisper edges.
Data from larger organisations can produce more prominent
roles and data partitions.
RoleVAT can analyse both user and permission tenden-
cies. RoleVAT on permission tendency identify trends in role
groupings. If permission assignments form clusters, RBAC
can easily be implemented. Each of the permission clusters
can be mapped to a potential role. How roles relate to each
other can also be seen in RoleVAT results. If permissions
are assigned to more than one role, if roles have multiple
sets of overlapping permissions, this can be identiﬁed in the
RoleVAT image, as demonstrated in Figure 4(a).
Images produced from RoleVAT on permission assess-
ment can also identify role quantity. In Figure 6(a), 10
signiﬁcant role clusters can be identiﬁed, each representing
one of the 10 roles in the original data. Currently, role
quantity is determined using visual inspection. Automated
role quantity extraction on larger datasets is an avenue for
future research.
RoleVAT using permission dissimilarity data reveal many
interesting correlations between roles. RoleVAT using user
dissimilarity shows possible data partitioning, which can
improve performance of current role mining techniques. The
role mining problem and its variations are NP-Complete.
As a result, optimal solutions are unlikely to be identiﬁed
quickly. However, reasonable solutions can be found quickly
in smaller datasets and it has been suggested that data parti-
tioning and merging ﬁnal results can improve performance.
RoleVAT using user dissimilarity shows when data partitions
can be possible. RoleVAT can be used to identify when
data can be partitioned into smaller subsets, thereby enabling
faster execution.
Experimental results also show RoleVAT to be efﬁcient.
Computation on even the largest dataset can complete in un-
der 100 seconds. In larger datasets, the most computational
expensive part of RoleVAT is calculation of the dissimilarity
matrix. Since RoleVAT can be separated into two distinct
parts, the dissimilarity matrix can be pre-computed and only
the reordering of the matrix is required to produce the
visualisation. The separation of dissimilarity calculation and
reordering is also beneﬁcial for isolated study of permission
set dissimilarity measure as well as the isolated study of
the greedy reordering algorithm. Alternative dissimilarity
measures for user and permission comparison as well as
methods for re-ordering the dissimilarity matrix are being
investigated.
RoleVAT is an effective tool for identifying practical need
of RBAC within a given enterprise. Role tendencies can
be identiﬁed using permission dissimilarity matrices and
user groupings can be identiﬁed using user dissimilarities.
In some situations, role quantity can also be identiﬁed.
RoleVAT can be completed within exceptional run times
given the complexity of the problem.
VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
This paper proposes RoleVAT, a Role engineering tool for
the Visual Assessment of user and permission Tendencies to
identify practical need for RBAC. RoleVAT produces images
that represent the natural permission and user groupings to
determine if roles can be identiﬁed and if user permission
data can be partitioned.
We test the approach on real access control data from
enterprise environments as well as synthetically generated
data. RoleVAT results can be computed quickly to reveal
interesting attributes of RBAC environments. Visual as-
sessment of users and permissions effectively allow for
immediate identiﬁcation of roles and data partitions. There is
a clear distinction between datasets with RBAC and datasets
without RBAC.
The number of possible data partitions and the quantity
of roles can be identiﬁed. However, when the number of
roles is large, visually determining role quantity is tedious
and prone to errors. Future work involve automatically
determining role quantity using RoleVAT for larger datasets.
RoleVAT analyses user tendency or permission tendency
using a square dissimilarity matrix. How RoleVAT can be
performed on both user and permission tendency using a
rectangular dissimilarity matrix is also an avenue for future
research. Currently, alternatives for dissimilarity measures
between users and permissions and alternatives methods for
reordering the dissimilarity matrix are also being investi-
gated.
