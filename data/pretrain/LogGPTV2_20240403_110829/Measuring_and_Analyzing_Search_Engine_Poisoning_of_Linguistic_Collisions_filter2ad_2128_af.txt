adapt an RNN architecture to predict misspellings that are likely
to avoid auto-correction, to more efﬁciently identify linguistic-
collision search terms.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we conduct the ﬁrst large-scale measurement
analysis of search engine poisoning, evaluating over 1.77
million searches on Google and Baidu. By using linguistics
and measurement techniques, we systematically analyze the
linguistic-collision misspelling attack for English and Chinese.
We further develop a deep learning model to more efﬁciently
select non-auto-corrected misspelled keywords.
Our ﬁndings reveal
that linguistic-collision misspellings
widely exist in search engines with 1.19% of search results
on the ﬁrst page directing to blacklisted websites. We also
discover the primary target is drug, gambling, and adult terms.
In addition, we observe that mobile users disproportionately
search for misspellings. Although search engine providers
have already reduced the attack surface of typosquatting by
adding auto-correction, linguistic-collision misspellings present
a vulnerability that attackers can exploit to promote malicious
links. Our study sheds light on this new threat and provides
insights to ultimately mitigate the problem.

APPENDIX
A. RNN Comparison to Random Forest and Naive Bayes
We compare the accuracy of non-auto-corrected predictions of
our RNN model with random forest and naive Bayes algorithms
using two approaches for each algorithm.
Approach 1. The ﬁrst approach directly classiﬁes whether a
misspelling string is likely to be non-auto-corrected by Google.
The brute-force search results of manually selected categories
contain both positive and negative cases, which we use as the
training dataset. Because both of the classiﬁcation algorithms
require ﬁxed length input vectors, we pad the variable length
words with null values. After training, the algorithms estimate
the probability that a given misspelling will be autocorrected.
However, because the ground truth data is generated from
relatively few original terms (compared to all possible words in
use on the Internet), the algorithms struggle to generalize for
misspellings generated from other original terms.
Approach 2. The second approach is similar to the one that
we developed in Section IV. In this approach, we generate a
training dataset from dictionary words. The classiﬁer learns the
future character distribution based on the preﬁxes. The entropy
of a prediction estimate the likelihood whether a misspelling
candidate will be automatically corrected.
For misspellings from Alexa top 1,001–10,000 terms, our
RNN approach achieves a hitting rate of 38.04% (as shown
in Table II). At the same hitting rate on the Alexa top 1K
ground truth, we need to collect 127,438 searches with the best
predictions from the RNN. When crawling the same number of
searches, the naive Bayes model with approach 1 yields a hit
rate of 13.6% . We hypothesize that the naive Bayes model’s
poor performance stems from the strong dependency between
adjacent characters. For approach 2, naive Bayes achieves a
hit rate of 15.2% (most likely due to the reduced input size).
Since random forests can capture dependencies between input
features, the random forest classiﬁer outperforms naive Bayes
for both approach 1 and approach 2. For approach 1, random
forest exhibits a hit rate of 29.9%, and for approach 2 the hit
rate is 22.8%, both of which are less efﬁcient than the RNN
predictions.
