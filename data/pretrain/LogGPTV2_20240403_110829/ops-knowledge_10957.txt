User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题PHP 5.3 mssql support on Linux I have a RHEL 5 box with php 5.3 that I am tasked with installing mssql support on.  I installed php53-mssql and reloaded apache.  It seems that modules were installed to /usr/lib/php/modules but my PHP modules are in /usr/lib64/php/modules (lib64).  I couldn't just copy those modules into lib64 because they are not the correct ELF CLASS (probably wrong arch).  When trying mssql_connect() I get an undefined function error in the Apache error log.  How can I get this to work? php -m shows these DB modules, but no mssql ones.

PDO
pdo_mysql
pdo_sqlite
mysql
mysqli

Assistant: You need to enable mssql module in php.ini. You need to uncomment this line:

extension=mssql.so


If you can't find it in php.ini, then just add it to the end of other extension definitions in your php.ini file. Restart apache after that.
