## Abstract

As the Internet continues to grow in both size and traffic volume, networks around the world are increasingly using a variety of methods to exchange traffic. This diversity complicates straightforward questions such as "What is the application mix in today’s Internet?" unless they are refined by specifying the vantage point, the involved networks, or the type of interconnection.

In this paper, we address the question of the application mix in today’s Internet and make two primary contributions. First, we develop a methodology for classifying the application mix in packet-sampled traces collected at one of the largest Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in Europe and globally. Our method can classify nearly 95% of the traffic using a stateful classification approach that relies on payload signatures, communication patterns, and port-based classification as a fallback. Second, our results show that, when viewed from this vantage point and aggregated over all the IXP’s public peering links, the Internet’s application mix is similar to that reported in other recent studies with different vantage points, peering links, or classification methods. However, the aggregate application mix does not represent the mix seen on individual peering links. We demonstrate that the business type of the Autonomous Systems (ASes) responsible for much of the IXP’s total traffic significantly influences the application mix of their overall traffic and on their major peering links.

## 1. Introduction

Understanding the Internet’s application mix is crucial for identifying new trends in Internet usage, optimizing application performance, and provisioning network resources. Consequently, there is a growing body of literature on inferring the Internet’s application mix, with various studies using different data sources and traffic classification techniques.

However, due to the heterogeneity of the Internet, its complex topology, and global scope, there are no simple answers to questions like "What are the most popular applications in today’s Internet?" or "What is the application mix in today’s Internet?" As more networks consider factors such as cost, performance, security, ease-of-use, and flexibility when deciding which kind of traffic to send over which type of peering links, the application mix can vary significantly from link to link.

In this paper, we focus on the representativeness of commonly-reported aggregate statistics concerning the Internet’s application mix, given the network’s enormous heterogeneity. We first develop a new methodology to classify traffic from packet-sampled traces, a technique widely used by large ISPs and IXPs for monitoring high-bandwidth infrastructures. We then apply this methodology to traffic traces collected at a large IXP, inferring the application mix on tens of thousands of public peering links. Our results highlight the heterogeneity of the Internet’s application mix and provide insights into how and why it can differ across different types of networks and interconnections.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
- We develop a traffic characterization methodology that can classify up to 95% of the traffic in our dataset. The novelty of our approach lies in its stateful classification technique, which overcomes the challenges posed by random packet sampling.
- We apply our methodology to traffic traces collected at a large European IXP over a period of 2.5 years, providing details about the aggregate application mix, including pronounced diurnal cycles and trends observed over time.
- We compare the aggregate application mix observed at our IXP to that reported in other recent studies. While the aggregate mix is comparable to those reported in other studies, it is not representative of the mix seen on individual peering links. We also show that the business type of the ASes on either side of these peering links has a strong influence on the application mix of the traffic that traverses those links.

## 2. Dataset Characteristics

We use packet-sampled traffic traces captured from the public switching fabric of a large European IXP. Our dataset consists of five snapshots, each covering a full week, selected from a period spanning 2.5 years. Table 1 provides an overview of the dataset characteristics. Unless otherwise specified, we use the most recent snapshot (September 2013) as the default dataset.

During the most recently monitored period in September 2013, the IXP had close to 500 members and a peak traffic rate of approximately 2.5 Tbps. Our traces consist of sFlow records, captured using a random packet sampling rate of 1-out-of-16K packets. Each sFlow record includes the first 128 bytes of each Ethernet frame, capturing the full link layer, network layer, and transport layer protocol headers, along with a limited number of payload bytes.

| **Name** | **Time Range** | **Sampling Rate** | **Packets** | **Bytes** | **IPv4/IPv6** | **TCP/UDP** |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 09-2013  | 2013-09-02 to 2013-09-08 | 1/16 K | 9.3 B | 5.9 TB | 99.36/0.63 | 83.7/16.3 |
| 12-2012  | 2012-12-01 to 2012-12-07 | 1/16 K | 8.5 B | 5.5 TB | 99.64/0.36 | 83.1/16.9 |
| 06-2012  | 2012-06-04 to 2012-06-10 | 1/16 K | 7.3 B | 4.6 TB | 99.80/0.20 | 80.7/19.3 |
| 11-2011  | 2011-11-28 to 2011-12-04 | 1/16 K | 6.4 B | 4.2 TB | 99.93/0.07 | 79.8/20.2 |
| 04-2011  | 2011-04-25 to 2011-05-01 | 1/16 K | 5.3 B | 3.5 TB | 99.94/0.06 | 79.2/20.3 |

In the following, we consider only IPv4 traffic, as the fraction of IPv6 is still below 1% in all our snapshots.

The sampled nature of our datasets poses significant challenges for traditional traffic classification approaches. To assess the impact of sampling on the visibility of complete flows, we aggregate the packets using the typical 5-tuple (source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, and the transport protocol). Figure 1(a) shows the number of packets sampled for each flow, using a 1200-second timeout. It indicates that we see only a single packet for about 86% of the sampled TCP flows (76% for UDP flows). We also observe flows with several hundred thousand sampled packets over the course of a week. Surprisingly, UDP flows dominate the heavy-hitter flows, and closer inspection reveals that most of the large UDP flows are related to recursive DNS interactions between name servers. Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative total number of bytes related to flows for which we sample less than or equal to x packets. For TCP, more than 45% of the bytes are sampled from flows with only a single packet (27.5% for UDP).

Since we only observe packets, we cannot rely on per-flow properties or expect to sample packets at specific positions within a flow. Moreover, we have no visibility into the bidirectional nature of any flow; sampling provides us with a "random set of packets."

## 3. Classification Approach

### 3.1 Related Work

Application classification has been a subject of extensive research, resulting in a variety of methods and studies. However, the characteristics of our datasets (sampling, lack of bidirectional visibility) pose new challenges for application classification. Most existing classification approaches require information that is not available in our datasets, making them unsuitable for our context.

Before presenting our new application characterization method, we provide a concise taxonomy of existing classification approaches, focusing on aspects that prevent their direct applicability to our datasets. For a detailed discussion, we refer to surveys such as [10, 13, 20, 25, 29].

#### Port-Based Approach

Many applications run on fixed port numbers, which can be used for classification. However, this approach has limitations:
- Applications can use random port numbers (e.g., P2P applications).
- Applications may use well-known port numbers to obfuscate traffic.

Despite these drawbacks, port-based classification is robust to sampling and can be applied to our dataset. Note that port-based classification was already performed for the sFlow data captured at this IXP in [7].

#### Payload-Based Approach

Also known as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), this approach uses application-specific signatures (known byte patterns) to produce accurate results. Signatures are typically based on protocol handshakes and can often be assembled using the first few payload-carrying packets. While we have access to the initial bytes of the payload of each sampled packet, we do not necessarily sample the first packets of flows containing application signatures. Additionally, we cannot inspect bidirectional payload patterns of flows using our datasets.

#### Flow Features-Based Approach

This approach classifies flows based on properties such as the total number of packets and average packet size without inspecting the payload. Since we do not have per-flow information, these approaches are not applicable to our dataset.
