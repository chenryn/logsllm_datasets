Number of web servers (Nw )
Figure 12. Web service unavailability (imperfect coverage)
Both figures  show  that  increasing  the  number  of  web
servers NW from 1 to 2,  3  or  4  (depending  on  the  failure
and  request  arrival  rates)  reduces 
the  web  service
unavailability. However,  the  trend  is  reversed when  the
coverage is imperfect for NW values higher than  4  (Figure
12).  This  is  due  to  the  fact that  when  the  coverage  is
imperfect, increasing  the  number  of  servers also increases
the  probability  for  the  system  being  in  states  yi  (of
Figure 10)  where the  web  service  is  unavailable  and  a
manual  reconfiguration  action  is  required.  Actually,  the
probability  of  a  request  being  rejected  because  the buffer
is full plays a significant role until a certain value  of  NW.
When the  number  of  servers  is  higher  than  the  threshold
value,  the  total  service  rate  and  the  buffer  capacity  are
sufficient  to  handle  the  flow  of  arrivals  without rejecting
requests. In this case, the unavailability of the web  service
mainly results from hardware and software failures  leading
the web  server  architecture  to  a  down  state.  Compared  to
the imperfect coverage model,  it  can  be  noticed  that  the
model  with  perfect  coverage  is  more  sensitive  to  the
variation  of  NW.  Indeed the  unavailability  decreases

exponentially  when  NW  increases and  the  trend  is  not
reversed for  values  higher  than  4.  Also,  the  web servers
failure  rate  has  a  significant  impact  on  availability  only
when the system load ((cid:95)/(cid:105)) is lower than 1.
Design  decisions  can  be  made  based  on  the  results
presented on these figures. In particular,  we  can  determine
to  achieve  a  given
the  number  of  servers  needed 
availability  requirement,  or  evaluate
the  maximum
availability  that  can  be  obtained  when  the  number  of
servers  is  set  to  a  given  value.  For  instance,  considering
the model with imperfect  coverage, the  number  of  servers
needed to  satisfy  an  unavailability  lower  than  5  min/year
-3
(unavailability  <  10
per hour will be at least NW=2 if the request arrival  rate  is
50 per second and NW=4  if  the  request  arrival  rate  is  100
per second.  We  obtain  the  same  result  with  a  failure rate
10
per  hour,  however such  a  requirement  cannot  be
satisfied with a failure rate of 10
),  with  a  failure  rate  equal  to  10
per hour.

Similar  sensitivity  analyses  can  be  done  to  study  the
level of availability that can be achieved when  the  number
of web servers is set to a given  value.  For  example,  if  we
decide to employ three servers to support  the  web  service,
we  would  have  an  unavailability  lower  than  1  hour  per
year, when the failure rate varies from 10
 and  the

5.2.  User  level  availability  results
Considering  equation  (10),  we  will  evaluate the
availability  as  perceived  by  user  classes  A  and  B.  The
values  of  the  parameters involved  in  this  equation  are
given  in  Table 7.  The  probabilities  characterizing  user
execution scenarios for classes A and B profiles  have  been
presented in Table 1. It is assumed that the  web  service  is
implemented  on  four  servers,  with  imperfect coverage
(NW=4, c=0.98, (cid:95)=100/sec, (cid:104)=10
/hour).

Table 7. Model parameters
Table 8 presents the user perceived  availability  for  user
classes  A  and  B,  considering  different  values  for  the
number  of  flight,  car and  hotel  reservation systems  (NF,
NH, NC)  interacting  with  the  travel  agency system.  The
same number is assumed for NF, NH and NC.
The  results  show  that  for  a  given  user  class,  the  user
perceived availability increases significantly  when  the
number of reservation systems  increases from  1  to  4,  and
then  stabilizes.  The  availability  variation  rate  is  directly
related  to  the  availability  assigned  to  each  reservation
system.  Comparison  of  the  results  obtained  for  class  A
and B users show that different  operational  profiles might
lead to significant differences  in  the  availability  perceived
by the users.  For  instance,  considering  the  case NF  =  NH
= NC (cid:149)  5,  the  user  perceived unavailability  is  about  173
hours per year for class A users and 190  hours  for  class  B
users.  Such  unavailability  takes  into  account all  the
scenarios that might be invoked by the users.

Table 8. Class A and B user availabilities wrtNF, NH, NC
The  user  perceived availability can  be  analyzed  from
another  perspective  by  grouping  user  scenarios  into four
categories,  denoted  as  SC1,  SC2,  SC3  and SC4,  and
evaluating  the  contribution  of  each  category  to 
the
perceived availability:
• SC1 gathers  all  scenarios  that  lead  to  the  execution  of
functions “Home”  or  “Browse”  without  invoking  the
other functions (scenarios 1-3 of Table 1).
• SC2 gathers  all  scenarios  that  include  the  invocation  of
the “Search” function,  without  going  through  the  “Book”
or “Pay” functions (scenarios 4-6 of Table 1).
• SC3 gathers  all  scenarios  that  include  the  “Book”
function (scenarios 7-9 of Table 1).
• SC4 gathers  all  scenarios that reach the  “Pay”  function
(i.e., scenarios 10-12 of Table 1).
This is illustrated on figure 13 considering class  A  and
class  B  users,  respectively,  and  assuming  that  the  web
service  is  implemented  on  four  servers with imperfect
coverage.
UA  (A users)  (respectively UA  (B  users))  denotes  the
unavailability perceived  by  Class  A  users,  and  UA(SCi)
denotes  the  contribution  of  scenarios  SCi  to  the  user
perceived unavailability.

Figure 13. User perceived unavailability and UA(SCi)
It  can  be  seen  that  the  unavailability  caused  by
scenarios SC4  that  end  up  with  a  trip  payment  is  higher
for  class  B  users  compared  to  class  A  users  (43  hours
downtime per year for class B users compared to  16  hours
for  class  A  users.  when  considering  the  steady  values).
Therefore, the  impact  in  terms  of  loss  of  revenue for  the
TA  provider  will  be  higher.  Indeed. 
the  users
transaction  rate  is  100 per second,  the  total  number  of
transactions ending up with a payment that  are lost  is  5.7
million for  class  A  users  and  15.5  million  for  class  B
users.  Assuming  that  the  average  revenue  generated  by
each transaction  is  100$.  Then  the  loss  of  revenue
amounts  to  570  million  dollar  and  1.55  billion  dollar,
respectively. This result clearly shows that  it  is  important
to have a faithful estimation of the user operational  profile

6. Conclusion
in  [12]  for 
In  this  paper,  we  have  illustrated  the  main  concepts
that  we  defined within  our  hierarchical modeling
framework proposed 
the  dependability
evaluation  of  internet  based  applications  on  a  travel
agency example. Our  objectives  were:  1)  to  show  how  to
apply  our  framework considering  the  decomposition  of
the target system  according  to  four  levels:  user,  function,
service,  and  resource levels,  and  2)  to  present  typical
dependability analysis and evaluation results that could  be
obtained  from  the  modeling  to  help  the  e-business
providers in making objective design decisions.
(yet 
realistic) 
simplified 
For  the  sake  of  illustration,  we  have  deliberately
considered
assumptions,
concerning  the  users  operational  profile  and  the  TA
architecture models, and analyzed their impact  on  the  user
perceived availability. The availability measure considered
takes  into  account
the  impact  of  performance  related
failures  as  well  as  traditional  software and hardware
failures.  The  sensitivity  analyses  presented  in  this paper
clearly show the appropriateness of this measure.  We  have
showed that the proposed  hierarchical  framework  provides
a  systematic  and  pragmatic  modeling  approach, that  is
necessary  to  be  able  to  evaluate 
the  dependability
characteristics  of  the  target application  at  different  levels
of abstractions.
Future  work  will  be  focused  on  the  extension  of  the
framework  to  handle  more  complex  assumptions  and
models.  For  example,  besides 
into  account
performance failures related to the loss of user  transactions
due to servers input buffers being full, we  can also extend
the measure  to  include  failures  that  occur when  the
response time exceeds an acceptable threshold.
