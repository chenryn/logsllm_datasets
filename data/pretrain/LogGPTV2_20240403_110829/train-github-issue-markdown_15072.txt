I am trying to use Chinese text in my plot. There are some pre-installed font
on the system which support Chinese (using `fc-list :lang=zh`), for example
"WenQuanYi Zen Hei". But I find that these fonts can not be found by
matplotlib. I checked some of the code of font_manager. I find that
font_manger seems intentionally avoid finding font files in ttc extensions.
In order to use these font, I have to explicitly give the path of the font,
like the following example code:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.font_manager as mfm
    ch_font = mfm.FontProperties(fname="/usr/share/fonts/wqy-zenhei/wqy-zenhei.ttc")
    plt.annotate(xy=(0.5, 0.5), s=u'测试', xycoords='axes fraction', fontproperties=ch_font)
    plt.show()
What is the reason behind this ?
