User: How to check server hard disk usage and find files that take up a lot of disk space?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to check the hard disk usage of the server and find files that occupy a large amount of disk space: 1. The df command can be used to view disk usage, including disk space size, used space, available space, and mount point, etc. information. ``` df -h ``` 2. The du command can be used to check the disk usage of files or directories, sort by size, and display files or directories that occupy a large space. ``` du -ah --max-depth=1 / | sort -hr ``` The above command will list the sizes of all files and directories under the root directory, and sort them in descending order. The Path and Depth parameters can be modified as desired. In addition, you can also use graphical tools such as ncdu to view the hard disk usage, and delete unnecessary files or directories conveniently.
