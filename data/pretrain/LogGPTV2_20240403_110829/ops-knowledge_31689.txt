User: I am trying to redirect a POST request from an Google App Engine Python Handler to another URL. The Problem is that it seems the method is changed to GET. Is there any way to set the POST method when redirecting?
Assistant: Use a 307 redirect. A 307 will not change the method of the redirect.
