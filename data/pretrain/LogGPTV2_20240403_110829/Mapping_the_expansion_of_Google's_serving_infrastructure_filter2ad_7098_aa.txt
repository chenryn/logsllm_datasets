## Abstract
Modern content-distribution networks (CDNs) not only provide bulk content but also act as "serving infrastructures" for web services to reduce user-perceived latency. These infrastructures, such as Google’s, are critical to the online economy, making it essential to understand their size, geographic distribution, and growth strategies. To this end, we develop techniques to enumerate servers, determine their geographic locations, and identify the associations between clients and servers. Our methods leverage the design and mechanisms of serving infrastructures to improve accuracy. We use the EDNS-client-subnet extension to DNS to measure which clients a service maps to which of its servers. We introduce a novel technique that uses this mapping to geolocate servers by combining noisy client location data with speed-of-light constraints, significantly improving geolocation accuracy. Additionally, we cluster servers into physical sites by measuring round-trip times (RTTs) and dynamically adjusting cluster thresholds. Using these methods, we chart the dramatic growth of Google’s serving infrastructure over six months and analyze its content-serving strategy. We find that Google has nearly doubled in size, primarily by placing servers in ISPs worldwide rather than expanding on its backbone.

## 1. Introduction
The internet traffic landscape has evolved significantly, with web serving infrastructures playing a crucial role in content delivery. These infrastructures consist of decentralized serving sites with frontend servers, directing clients to nearby frontends to minimize latency. Providers invest heavily in building and optimizing these infrastructures, developing sophisticated mapping algorithms to direct clients to the nearest servers.

In recent months, Google’s serving infrastructure has nearly doubled in size. Given the increasing economic importance of these infrastructures, understanding the content-serving strategies of large web service providers, particularly Google, is imperative. We focus on the geographic and topological scope of serving infrastructures, their expansion, and how client populations impact their build-out.

Previous studies have explored static snapshots of CDNs, often focusing on bulk content delivery, new mapping methodologies, or DNS selection methods. In contrast, our work focuses on the broader class of web serving infrastructures, developing more accurate methods to enumerate and locate frontends and serving sites, and exploring the growth of Google’s infrastructure over six months.

### Contributions
1. **Methods for Enumeration, Geolocation, and Clustering:**
   - **Enumeration:** We use the EDNS-client-subnet prefix extension to enumerate frontend servers.
   - **Geolocation:** Our novel geolocation technique, called Client-Centric Geolocation (CCG), improves accuracy by leveraging the geographic mean of client locations and filtering out bad location data using speed-of-light constraints.
   - **Clustering:** We cluster servers into serving sites using RTT-based fingerprinting and dynamic thresholding, providing enough resolution to distinguish different sites in the same city.

2. **Detailed Study of Google’s Web Serving Infrastructure:**
   - We observe the rapid growth of Google’s serving infrastructure, finding that it has almost doubled in the number of frontend IP addresses, expanded to 62 countries, and deployed in 87 new ASes.
   - Google's recent growth strategy involves moving away from its backbone and towards lower tiers in the AS hierarchy, with the number of /24 prefixes served off Google’s network nearly doubling.
   - The expansion has shifted the distribution of geographic distances from clients to their nearest front-end servers, reducing geolocation errors but still necessitating CCG’s filtering techniques.

## 2. Background
### CDNs and Serving Infrastructures
Optimizing web serving infrastructure to deliver content quickly is crucial for retaining users and business. Major services now rely on distributed infrastructures, replicating services at serving sites around the world to serve clients from the closest site. CDNs initially sped up content delivery by caching static and some dynamic content near client networks. Today, they also handle dynamic personalized content and query responses, using frontend servers to proxy requests back to data centers.

### DNS-based Redirection
Serving infrastructures use DNS to direct clients to appropriate serving sites. Traditional DNS resolution only knows the IP address of the client’s resolver, leading to suboptimal server choices. The EDNS-client-subnet extension allows clients to embed a portion of their IP address in the request, enabling services to direct clients to the optimal server directly.

## 3. Goal and Approach
Our goal is to understand content-serving strategies for large IPv4-based serving infrastructures, particularly Google’s. We aim to measure the number of serving sites and frontend servers, their geographic and topological locations, and the client-to-site associations. We also track the evolution of these infrastructures.

To achieve this, we develop novel measurement methods:
- **Enumeration:** Using the EDNS-client-subnet extension to emulate DNS requests from every active prefix in the IP address space.
- **Geolocation:** Leveraging the property that clients directed to a server are likely to be close to it, we approximate server locations using the geographical mean of client locations (CCG).
- **Clustering:** Using PlanetLab to cluster frontends into serving sites based on RTT vectors and standard clustering algorithms.

By applying these methods over six months, we study the dramatic growth of Google’s serving infrastructure and its evolving content-serving strategy.
