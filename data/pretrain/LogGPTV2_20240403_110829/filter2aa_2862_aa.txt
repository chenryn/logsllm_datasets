### Abstract
**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)** refers to targeted attacks against specific companies or organizations by one or more organized attack groups. Our presentation will provide case studies and analyze APTs from malicious email documents. Through automated analysis, we can identify and cluster the correlation among samples featuring various exploits, malware, and botnets.

### APT Overview
- **Definition of APT**: Targeted attacks against specific entities.
- **Not APT**: Not related to general virus problems.
- **APT Characteristics**: Multi-vector attacks, including SQL injection, web server breaches, and password cracking.
- **Impact**: Compromised machines often have remote control tools installed, leading to data exfiltration and further internal network infiltration.

### APT vs. Traditional Botnet Activities
- **Targeting**: APTs are highly targeted, while traditional botnets spread widely.
- **Detection Rate**: APTs typically have a lower detection rate within the first month.
- **Attack Frequency**: APTs involve multiple, sustained attacks, while traditional botnets are usually one-time events.
- **Tools**: APTs use zero-day exploits, embedded RATs, and droppers, while traditional botnets use full-function RATs and URL downloads.

### Research Directions
- **Holistic Approach**: We focus on the entire APT attack plan and trends rather than individual incidents.
- **Feature Extraction**: Analyze and extract features and characteristics of APT taskforces through malware, exploits, C&C networks, spear-phishing emails, victim backgrounds, and attack times.

### APT File Analysis and Grouping
- **Theoretical Basis**: Collecting all attributes of malicious samples can help identify their nature.
- **Challenges**: Insufficient collection of attributes due to packing and anti-debugging techniques.
- **Standard Analysis Methods**: Static and dynamic approaches, including signature extraction, reversing, controlled execution, and network traffic analysis.
- **Challenges in Malware/Exploit Analysis**: Encryption, obfuscation, anti-VM/sandbox, dormant functionality, and side effects of master/bot interactions.

### Focused APT Attributes
- **Static Analysis**: Extract and review executable, shellcode, and PE headers; detect abnormal structures and known code snippets.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Install in Windows, scan process memory, detect code injection, API hooking, and suspicious strings.
- **Data Extraction**: CVE, shellcode, entropy, network, structure, and behavior attributes.

### Example Data
- **Concept**: Data, CVE, Shellcode, Entropy, Network, Structure, Malware, Behavior, Discretization.
- **Example Values**: 
  - **CVE**: CVE-2009-3129
  - **Shellcode**: Code=90903CFDEF, CAPO=E2FE9071, PUCA=002191CB
  - **Entropy**: 6.821483
  - **Network**: 140.128.115.***, smtp.126.com, test.3322.org.cn
  - **Structure**: JS=A103FE426E214CE, JS=90C0C0C0C, AS=32EF90183227
  - **Malware 1**: PE=EF024788, Entry=000B7324, Code=D7B5A0120987FE, Autorun=STARTUP_FOLDER, Behavior=DLL-Injection, Password Collector
  - **Malware 2**: PE=EF93461A, Entry=0003CAC0, Code=AC23109B, Behavior=API-Hooking
  - **Discretization**: SC.5D5819EE, SC.D810C601, PE.EBD5880B, PE.5A05A491, CD.FC7939E2, CD.102C752B, CD.2AFB773A, ML.47E1B4C6
