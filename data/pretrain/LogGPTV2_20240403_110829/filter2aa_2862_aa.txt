Bio 
Jeremy Chiu (aka Birdman) 
○
He has more than ten years of experience with host-based security, focusing on kernel 
technologies for both the Win32 and Linux platforms. In early 2001 he was created Taiwan's first 
widespread trojan BirdSPY. And now, he is also a contract trainer for law enforcements, intelligence 
organizations, and conferences such as DEFCON 18, SySCAN (09 08), Hacks in Taiwan (07 06 05), 
HTICA(06 08) and OWASP Asia (08 07). Jeremy specializes in rootkit/backdoor design. Jeremy also 
specializes in reverse engineering and malware analysis, and has been contracted by law 
enforcements to assist in forensics operations. Jeremy is a sought-after speaker for topics related 
to security, kernel programming, and object-oriented design  
Benson Wu 
○
He currently works as Postdoctoral Researcher from Research Center for Information Technology 
Innovation at Academia Sinica in Taiwan. He focuses research on malware and threat analysis, code 
review, secure coding and SDLC process implementation. He graduated from National Taiwan 
University with PhD degree in Electrical Engineering. He had spoken at NIST SATE 2009, DEFCON 
18 (with Birdman), OWASP China 2010, and wrote the "Web Application Security Guideline" for the 
Taiwan government. 
Anothny Lai ( aka DarkFlyod )

He works on code audit, penetration test, crime investigation and threat analysis and acted as 
security consultant in various MNCs. His interest falls on studying exploit, reverse engineering, 
analyse threat and join CTFs, it would be nice to keep going and boost this China-made security 
wind in malware analysis and advanced persistent threat areas. 
○
He found security research group called VXRL in Hong Kong and has been working as visiting 
lecturer in HK Polytechnic University on hacking course :) Spoken at Blackhat USA 2010, DEFCON 
18 and Hack In Taiwan 2010/2011 
Abstract 
 APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) means 
any targeted attacks against any specific 
company/organization from an or/and a 
group of organized attack party(ies). 
 Other than providing the case studies, we 
would like to present and analyze APT from 
the malicious email document, throughout 
our automated analysis, we could identify 
and cluster the correlation among the 
samples featured with various exploit, 
malware and Botnet .

APT is not Virus problem ! 
APT是多种面向的攻击路径 
 外网主机如Web伺服器遭突破成功，多半是被SQL注入攻击 
 受骇Web伺服器被作为跳板，对内网的其他伺服器或桌机进行侦搜 
 内网机器如AD伺服器或开发人员电脑遭突破成功，多半是被密码暴
力破解 
 受害者的工作与私人信箱被设定自动被份给骇客 
 受骇机器遭植入恶意程式，多半被安装远端控制工具（RAT），传回
大量机敏文件（WORD、PPT、PDF等等），包括所有会议记录与组
织人事架构图 
 更多内网机器被"设计"遭入侵成功，多半为高阶主管点击了看似正常
的邮件附档，却不知其中含有恶意程式 
APT Attack Vs Traditional Botnet Activities

Targeted (only a few

Detection Rate 
Detection rate is lower than 10% if 
the sample comes out within one 
month 
Detection rate is around 95% if the 
sample comes out within one 
month 
Remarks: IPS, IDS and Firewall cannot help and detect in this area  
Continued APT Mail EVERYDAY! 
 20,000 Malicious Mails !? 
Major APT Activity: Targeted-Attack Email 
 In APT activities, we have observed there are 
three major types of Targeted-Attack Email： 
 Phishing mail: Steal user ID and password 
 Malicious script: Detect end-use computing 
environment 
 Install and deploy Malware (Botnet) ! 
APT Mail = Document Exploit + Malware 
Research Direction (1/2) 
 We are not just focusing on a single one-
off attack, we tend to observe the entire 
APT attack plan and trend 
 Traditionally, we just focus on malware forensics 
or analyze a single victim’s machine. We cannot 
understand the APT attack plan and its trend 
indeed. 
Research Direction (2/2) 
 Analyze and extract features and 
characteristics of APT taskforce via: 
 Malware features 
 Exploit 
 C&C Network 
 Speared Email 
 Victim’s background 
 Time of attack 
APT File Analysis and Grouping 
 Theoretically, in an information system (i.e. 
malware analysis system), if we could collect all the 
attributes/properties of our malicious sample sets, 
we could identify whether the 
executable/document/sample is malicious. 
 However, the research issues are insufficient 
collection in attributes/characteristics (for example, 
the malware has been packed and engage various 
anti-debugging capabilities), so that we get the 
indiscernibility relation. 
Research 
一箩筐APT的秘密 
(Secrets Behind) 
Standard Analysis Method 
 Static Approach 
 Extract signature/features from file format 
 Reversing 
 Dynamic Approach 
 Execute it under controlled environment and capture/log 
all the behaviors 
 Analyze networking traffic 
Challenge of Malware/Exploit Analysis 
Encryption, 
Obfuscation 
Anti-
VM/Sandbox 
Dormant 
Functionality 
Side-Effect of 
Master/Bot 
interaction 
We prefer using static analysis to prevent from Anti-VM, dormant 
functionality and side effect of master/bot interaction. 
What APT Attributes we focused? 
We work on the analysis on multi-concepts basis. 
Throughout static analysis: 
Extract and review executable, Shellcode and PE header 
Objects and abnormal structure in file 
Throughout dynamic analysis: 
Install the system into Windows 
Scan Process Memory to detect abnormal structure 
Code-Injection, API Hooking … 
Detect any known Code Snippet 
Rootkit, KeyLogger, Password Collector, Anti-AV…  
Suspicious strings: email address, domain, IP, URL 
Extract Attributes from APT File
