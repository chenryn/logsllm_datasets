User: How to build a Docker-based development environment? Please provide specific steps and related tools.
Assistant: Building a Docker-based development environment requires the following steps and tools: Steps: 1. Install Docker 2. Write Dockerfile 3. Build image 4. Run the container 5. Enter the container for development tools: 1. Docker 2. Docker Compose (optional, For managing multiple containers) Specific steps: 1. Install Docker: Download and install Docker according to the operating system. 2. Write Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of the project, and specify the components and configuration required for the development environment. For example, to create a Python-based development environment: ``` FROM python:3.7 WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt ./ RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt COPY . . CMD ["python", "app.py"] ``` 3. Build the image: use the `docker build` command to build the image, where `.` means to search for the Dockerfile in the current directory. ``` docker build -t my-dev-env:latest . ``` 4. Run the container: use the `docker run` command to start the container, where `-p` specifies the port mapping between the container and the host, `-v ` specifies the directory mapping between the host and the container, `-it` specifies the interactive terminal. ``` docker run -p 8000:8000 -v /my/local/directory:/app -it my-dev-env ``` 5. Enter the container for development: use the `docker exec` command to enter the running container, Start developing. ``` docker exec -it my-dev-env bash ``` References: 1.
