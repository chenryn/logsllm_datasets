User: Please describe what is virtualization technology (Virtualization), and provide common virtualization technology names?
Assistant: Virtualization technology refers to the abstraction and isolation of computer hardware resources (such as CPU, memory, network, disk, etc.), and provides independent operating systems and application operating environments for multiple virtual machines to achieve the best use of physical resources and resources. sharing, thereby improving computer utilization and flexibility. Common virtualization technologies include: 1. Container virtualization technology: Container virtualization technology implements parallel operation of multiple hardware-independent lightweight containers by isolating and sharing resources at the operating system level. 2. Full virtualization technology: Full virtualization technology simulates physical hardware to provide a real computer environment for each virtual machine, allowing the virtual machine to run any operating system and application. 3. Hardware-assisted virtualization technology: Hardware-assisted virtualization technology improves the performance and security of virtual machines through the support of CPU and related hardware. 4. Centralized virtualization technology: Centralized virtualization technology realizes centralized management and scheduling of resources by converging multiple physical servers on a centralized management node. 5. Desktop virtualization technology: Desktop virtualization technology realizes cross-platform and remote access desktop experience by virtualizing the personal computer environment to the server.
