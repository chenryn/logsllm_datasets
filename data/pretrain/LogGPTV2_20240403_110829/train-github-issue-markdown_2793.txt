I'm trying to use the new (introduced in r70 with `d433472`)
`THREE.BufferGeometry.prototype.merge()` functionality on buffer geometries
created with `THREE.PlaneBufferGeometry` but I'm getting this error during the
subsequent render call (the merging itself does not throw an error):
`Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'array' of undefined` (in Chrome) or  
`TypeError: this.attributes.position is undefined` (in Firefox)  
at this line in `THREE.BufferGeometry.prototype.computeBoundingSphere()`:
I was able to reduce the test case to a simple scene where I try to merge all
6 faces of a cube into a single `THREE.BufferGeometry`. Here is a jsfiddle of
how it should look using normal non buffer geometries
http://jsfiddle.net/3vwj3rj1/ and here is the jsfiddle for the same scene
using buffer geometries throwing the error: http://jsfiddle.net/3vwj3rj1/1/ .
Using the Java Script debugger it looks like that
`THREE.BufferGeometry.prototype.merge()` does not have copied the attributes
at all.
_I openedthis stackoverflow question about the same issue_
Edit: I think I somehow understand the problem now:
`THREE.BufferGeometry.prototype.merge()` doesn't take care of resizing the
buffer attributes at all and I should do something like this
http://jsfiddle.net/3vwj3rj1/3/ , but I still have no idea what to do with the
index attribute.
