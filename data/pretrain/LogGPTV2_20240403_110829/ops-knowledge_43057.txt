User: Please introduce the architecture and working principle of Kubernetes, and how Kubernetes manages containers.
Assistant: Kubernetes is an open source container-based platform for automatically deploying, maintaining, and scaling containerized applications. The basic architecture of Kubernetes includes nodes, master nodes and etcd. Nodes are physical servers or virtual machines on which containers can run. On each node is a container runtime, such as Docker, and a Kubernetes agent process, called a kubelet. The master control node is the central node of the Kubernetes cluster, which contains the Kubernetes controller and API server. The API server communicates with all components in the cluster and accepts and processes requests from controllers using the Kubernetes command line tools or other. The controller includes the following subsystems: ReplicaSet, Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, and CronJob. etcd is a key-value storage system used to store reliable data for all configuration information of a Kubernetes cluster. It stores the single source of cluster state to ensure that containers on all nodes are allocated correctly. Kubernetes works with a declarative API, which means that users only need to declare their desired state, and Kubernetes will try to change the cluster state to that state. This approach enables Kubernetes to automatically implement container orchestration, including automatic failover, horizontal scaling, and rolling updates. Kubernetes manages containers on nodes by using Kubelet. The Kubelet periodically requests the specification of its assigned Pods from the API server and ensures that all containers in the Pod are running. If a container fails or a node fails, Kubernetes automatically redistributes the pods to other available nodes. In short, Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that can automate the deployment, management, and expansion of containerized applications, while providing flexible APIs and tools that allow developers and operators to easily manage clusters.
