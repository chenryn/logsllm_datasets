BENCHMARK OPENCV APPLICATIONS.
Performance. Performance is critically important for per-
ceptual applications that deal with visual data. If the over-
head of privacy protection caused frame rates to drop
too much, applications would become unusable. Figure 10
shows that the performance overhead of DARKLY is very
minor and, in most cases, not perceptible by a human user.
The effect of a given privacy transform depends on the set-
ting of the privacy dial, aka the privacy level. For example,
sketching, the transform for the cvFindContours declassiﬁer,
applies different amounts of blurring before ﬁnding contours.
Fig. 11 shows that the performance variation of the security
camera application at different privacy levels is minimal
(within 3%). Interestingly, in this case performance does not
change monotonically with the privacy level. The reason is
that the OpenCV function used by the sketching transform
switches algorithms depending on the parameters.
Tradeoffs between privacy and utility. Table III shows that
for most applications, there is no change of functionality and
no loss of accuracy even at the maximum privacy setting.

Figure 10. Frame rates with and without DARKLY.
The reason is that these applications do not access raw
images and can operate solely on opaque references.
One application,
the QR decoder, works correctly at
privacy level 0, but not at higher settings. Even at privacy
level 0, signiﬁcant protection is provided by the thresholding
binary transform (see Fig. 7). For the remaining applications,

Figure 11.
Frame rate of the security-camera application as a function
of the privacy level. At levels above 4, OpenCV switches from directly
calculating the convolution to a DFT-based algorithm optimized for larger
kernels. Furthermore, as privacy level increases, smaller motions are not
detected and the application has to process fewer motions.
the tradeoff between their accuracy and user-selected privacy
level is shown in Fig. 12.
Support for other OpenCV applications. We found 281
GitHub projects mentioning “vision,” “applications,” and
“opencv.”10 Filtering out empty projects and clones with the
same name and codebase reduced the set to 77 projects.
10A simple search for “opencv” returns different parts of the OpenCV
library itself and does not work for ﬁnding OpenCV applications.
