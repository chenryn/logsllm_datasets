## Abstract

Digital insecurity in the face of targeted, persistent attacks increasingly leaves victims in debilitating or even life-threatening situations. We propose an approach called "clinical computer security" to help victims, particularly in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is widespread, and abusers exploit technology to track, harass, intimidate, and harm their victims. We report on the iterative design, refinement, and deployment of a consultation service that provides in-person security assistance from trained technologists. We created and tested a range of new technical and non-technical tools to systematize the discovery and investigation of complex, multimodal digital attacks seen in IPV. An initial field study with 44 IPV survivors demonstrated how our procedures and tools help victims discover account compromise, exploitable misconfigurations, and potential spyware.

## 1. Introduction

As computers and other digital technologies become increasingly central to people's lives, computer insecurity has become debilitating and even life-threatening for some. Activists and dissidents are monitored, journalists are harassed and doxed, gamers are bullied, and abusers exploit technology to surveil and harass their intimate partners. Traditional security mechanisms often fail in the face of such targeted, personalized, and persistent attacks.

We propose a different approach called "clinical computer security," which provides victims of dangerous attacks with personalized help from trained technologists. Just as people visit doctors for health problems, seek lawyers for legal issues, or hire accountants for complex tax situations, victims of dangerous digital attacks should have experts to assist them. However, while these professional services have a long history and established best practices, clinical computer security is starting from scratch. The challenge is to develop rigorous, evidence-based best practices and design the necessary tools to help victims.

In this paper, we explore clinical computer security in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is widespread, affecting one out of three women and one out of six men over the course of their lives. Abusers exploit technology to harass, impersonate, threaten, monitor, and intimidate their victims. Common attacks include account compromise, installation of spyware, and harassment on social media. These digital attacks can lead to physical violence, including murder. Unfortunately, victims currently have little recourse, relying on social workers or other professionals who lack sufficient computer security knowledge to aid them.

In collaboration with the New York City Mayor’s Office to End Domestic and Gender-Based Violence (ENDGBV), we designed, prototyped, and deployed a clinical computer security service for IPV survivors. This required developing first-of-their-kind protocols for handling face-to-face consultations while ensuring safety for both clients and technology consultants, as well as designing and implementing new technical and non-technical instruments to address the complex, multifaceted digital insecurities faced by clients.

Our consultation procedure starts with a referral from an IPV professional and proceeds through a face-to-face discussion where we understand the client’s technology issues, investigate their digital assets via programmatic and manual inspections, and advise them and the referring professional on potential steps forward. Supporting this framework are several tools we created, including a standardized technology assessment questionnaire (TAQ), a diagrammatic method for summarizing a client’s digital assets (technograph), guides for manually checking important security configurations, and a new spyware scanning tool (ISDi) that detects dangerous apps on mobile devices.

After completing our design process, we met with 44 clients and discovered potential spyware, account compromise, or exploitable misconfigurations for 23 of them. Our tools were critical to these discoveries, and without them, our consultations would have been significantly less effective. For clients with discovered issues, we provided advice on improving security, along with appropriate safety planning guided by case managers knowledgeable about their abuse history and current situation. Many other clients expressed relief that no problems were found. Professionals at Family Justice Centers (FJCs) have responded positively to our field study, reporting that the consultations are helpful to their clients. Demand for consultations has increased, and we are performing them on an ongoing basis. More broadly, our tools, including ISDi, will be made open-source and publicly available, providing resources for testing the replicability of our clinical approach in other locations. Whether our methods can be useful for other targeted attack contexts beyond IPV remains an open question, which we discuss at the end of the paper.

## 2. Towards Clinical Computer Security

This paper considers targeted attacks in the context of intimate partner violence (IPV). Prior work indicates that IPV victims frequently suffer from technology abuse, which can be categorized into four broad types: (1) ownership-based attacks, where the abuser owns the victim’s digital accounts or devices; (2) account or device compromise; (3) harmful messages or posts on social media; and (4) exposure of private information online. Abusers use access to victim devices or accounts to set up dangerous configurations, such as adding their fingerprints for device login, configuring devices to synchronize data with an abuser-controlled cloud account, or setting up tools like Find My Phone to send location updates to the abuser’s email. Another common tactic is the installation of spyware apps that provide powerful monitoring features.

Technology abuse in IPV is complex, and even specific individuals face multifaceted threats. To illustrate, consider the example of Carol, whose ex-husband subjected her to years of physical, emotional, and technology abuse. He installed spyware on her devices, accessed her private photos, and hacked into her online accounts, locking her out of her Gmail account and posting her photos on Facebook. Carol now has five devices, including a new iPhone, two Android phones used by her children, an iPad bought by her ex-husband, and an old iPhone. She uses various social media apps for her sales job, but her need to use these platforms limits her options for preventing harassment.

This example highlights the complexities faced by IPV victims, including a wide variety of devices and online accounts, entanglements with the abuser, and the risk of escalation if digital attacks are blocked. While new technology designs could better resist such attacks, they will not help IPV victims in the near term. Complementary socio-technical approaches are needed.

Existing victim support services struggle to handle complex tech abuse situations. Case workers, lawyers, police, and other professionals report having insufficient tech expertise to help victims. There are no best practices for discovering, assessing, and mitigating tech issues. Existing tools for detecting spyware are ineffective, and professionals often assume spyware on phones if a victim reports strange behavior. Commercial tech support services, such as Geek Squad, are not suitable for addressing tech abuse, as they lack the context-specific training needed to identify and handle complex tech abuse situations and may put victims at greater risk due to a lack of appropriate safety planning.

Clinical computer security aims to provide victims with personalized and appropriately contextualized support from trained technologists. While there are existing efforts, such as the Citizen Lab and the Technology-Enabled Coercive Control (TECC) clinic, there has been little research into how such services should be systematically designed and deployed. We propose an approach to develop, in a rigorous, evidence-based way, a set of best practices for how a technology consultant can assist a victim, called the client, with digital insecurity. Best practices will cover setting up and running clinics, recruiting and training volunteers or paid professionals, dealing with legal issues, and conducting consultations. In this initial work, we focus on designing and prototyping consultations, the fundamental element of any clinical approach.

The challenges in client consultations include understanding the client’s complex digital footprint, detecting tech risks, and safely advising them on steps to improve their computer security. While we can draw inspiration from other disciplines, such as medicine, social work, mental health counseling, and legal practice, none of these fields address computer security, so we need new approaches.

## 3. Methods, Client Safety, and Ethics

We designed a client consultation protocol and associated instruments to improve computer security outcomes for IPV victims through face-to-face discussions and both programmatic and manual investigations of their digital assets. Here, we discuss our iterative design methods, which prioritize client safety.

IPV victims can be in dangerous and even life-threatening situations, and we made client safety and well-being central to our methodological approach. No consultation process can guarantee the discovery, accurate assessment, and successful mitigation of all of the client’s technology problems. However, our goal is to minimize risks and provide the best possible support.
