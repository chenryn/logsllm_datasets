### Allocations and Sub-allocations

Initially, we compiled a list of sub-allocations, which unfortunately included many questionable entries due to the presence of adult and copyright-infringing websites. To refine this list, we utilized the top 500 hosting providers and searched Whois records to identify their corresponding sub-allocations. We further segmented this list into the top 100 and top 500 hosting providers to minimize false positives. Additionally, we cross-referenced these top 500 hosting providers with the SpamHaus ISP reputation database. If a provider was flagged in the SpamHaus database, we labeled it as "Clean - Noisy."

### Identifying Malicious Sub-allocations

To identify malicious sub-allocations, we employed a combination of blacklists and direct contact with Bulletproof Hosting (BPH) services. We used two SpamHaus lists: Edrop, which is manually maintained but has limited coverage (only 101 IP prefixes over nine months), and ROKSO, a more comprehensive list that includes detailed information on known spam operations and their actors. 

Within ROKSO, we identified 10 BPH actors out of 110 and successfully contacted two of them. Specifically, we contacted an actor named "MailTrain" via the ICQ number listed in ROKSO and purchased a server with one IP address for $186, intended for botnets and spam. ROKSO maintains two types of listings: current and archived. A current listing indicates that the IP address prefix is still in use by the actor, while an archived listing means the IP address prefix is no longer used. On July 6, 2016, we scanned the ROKSO list and collected both current and archived listings. For current listings, we searched Whois for matching sub-allocations. For archived listings, we selected sub-allocations created or modified within 10 days of the archiving date to account for potential delays in Whois record updates.

### Purchasing from BPH Services

We also scanned underground forums for posts advertising BPH services and attempted to purchase from them. Some BPH services have operational websites, albeit short-lived, while others can only be contacted via ICQ or Jabber and typically accept digital currencies like Bitcoin. Not all our purchase attempts were successful; some failed due to suspicion of being white hats, especially when language barriers were present. For example, during a purchase attempt with a Russian BPH service, we were asked several investigatory questions and ultimately had our payment refunded after they suspected us of being white hats.

In our purchasing process, we always requested test IP addresses first. If provided, we did not proceed with the purchase. We bought various hosting packages, including shared hosting, VPSs, and dedicated servers, and also purchased Fast Fluxing (FF) services. In total, we spent $1,155 and acquired 37 IP addresses corresponding to 21 sub-allocations. However, we could not label many of these full sub-allocations as malicious since we only acquired one IP address from each BPH service. For instance, one purchase resulted in a sub-allocation owned by Amazon, which cannot be labeled as malicious based on a single IP address.

### Data Processing

#### Finding Sub-allocations

The downloaded Whois bulk databases of inetnum objects do not include parent network blocks, except for the ARIN registry. The "status" attribute in the inetnum object should indicate the allocation type, but its accuracy depends on the service provider. Each registry uses different values for the status, so we built a hierarchy network tree for each network block to capture all parent levels. A network block is considered a sub-allocation if it has a parent.

#### Identifying Sub-allocation Owners

A sub-allocation owner is defined as an owner object containing specific contact information for the sub-allocation, excluding its parent. To generate an owner object, we collect identity-specific attributes such as names, emails, FQDNs, street addresses, and phone numbers. We then cross-match these with the owner objects of all parents and drop matched values. If the remaining attributes contain at least an email or organization name, the owner object is accepted. Otherwise, the sub-allocation is considered managed by its parent.

To capture resellers who switch or span multiple service providers and registries, we merge owner objects using strong, unique attributes like emails and organization names. Popular portal FQDNs (e.g., GMAIL) are excluded, and we drop the top 5% of common emails to avoid including generic administrator or account manager contacts.

#### Filtering Sub-allocations

We selected sub-allocations that exhibit hosting behaviors, specifically those hosting more than 10 TLD+3 and utilizing more than 25% of the network block according to PDNS data. These thresholds are based on the average values found in the labeled Top 500 hosting providers. Only leaf sub-allocations are selected to prevent incorrect feature propagation.

#### Feature Selection and Extraction

Unlike previous research on detecting BP ASes, where routing behavior and malicious activity volume are strong indicators, finding malice at the network block level is more challenging due to the smaller size and age of the network block. We carefully select and extract features to train a classifier for detecting BPHs.

### Example

Figure 7 shows a partial view of the network block hierarchy of four sub-allocations owned by different entities in "ColoCrossing." Three of these are confirmed resellers. The sub-allocations of "Server Central Network" and "ColoCrossing" are filtered out because they have children, and the Hudson Valley sub-allocation is dropped due to a lack of DNS records. The Irv Freiberg sub-allocation, although delisted from current Whois records, was detected running a spam campaign hosting 13 TLD+3 for over 19 months.
