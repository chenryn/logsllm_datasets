### Username Tool
The Username Tool allows you to quickly check a username across multiple platforms. For example, if the target username is "inteltechniques," you can use the tool to gather information from the following sources:
- **Search My Bio:** [https://www.searchmy.bio/search?q=inteltechniques](https://www.searchmy.bio/search?q=inteltechniques)
- **People Data Labs:** [https://peopledatalabs.com](https://peopledatalabs.com)

### Email Assumptions

- inteltechniques@gmail.com
- inteltechniques@yahoo.com
- inteltechniques@outlook.com
- inteltechniques@icloud.com
- inteltechniques@protonmail.com

### People Data Labs
- **API Query Example:**
  - **Facebook:** [https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?pretty=true&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&profile=www.facebook.com/inteltechniques](https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?pretty=true&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&profile=www.facebook.com/inteltechniques)
  - **Twitter:** [https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?pretty=true&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&profile=www.twitter.com/inteltechniques](https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich?pretty=true&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&profile=www.twitter.com/inteltechniques)

### Skype Username
To find a Skype username, you can use the following method:
1. Log in to your Skype account.
2. Navigate to the search area and enter the real name or email address of the target.
3. Right-click on the profile image and select "Open image in a new tab" (Chrome) or "View image" (Firefox).
4. The URL of the image will reveal the Skype username.

### Custom Search Tools
These tools automate the process of searching for usernames across various platforms. They include fields for HIBP, Dehashed, and other popular email domains. The code behind these tools ensures that searches are conducted with a short pause between each query to avoid server issues.

### University Personal Web Pages
Many universities issue students personal web pages and email addresses. The naming convention is often a tilde (~) followed by the first initial and the first six letters of the last name. For example, for "Scott Golike," the personal website would be:
- [http://www.siue.edu/~sgolike/](http://www.siue.edu/~sgolike/)

If the page no longer exists, you can use The Wayback Machine to find archived versions:
- [https://wayback.archive.org](https://wayback.archive.org)

### Real-World Application
In a recent case, a deleted student personal page was located using this method, providing valuable information that led to the quick identification of the subject.

### Historic Versions of University Pages
Archived versions of university pages can provide additional insights. For example:
- **Laura Swanson's Page:**
  - [http://www.siue.edu/~lswanso/](http://www.siue.edu/~lswanso/)
  - [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.siue.edu/~lswanso/](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.siue.edu/~lswanso/)

By following these steps and using the provided tools, you can effectively gather and analyze information related to usernames and compromised accounts.
