This popular link aggregation sendee allows members to announce all of their networks on one page. We can 
also take advantage of this via direct URL, such as the following.
You may desire a quick peek into the profile associated with a username across the most common networks. I 
added the following options to the Username Tool, assuming "inteltechniques" is the target username.
In the previous chapter, I explained how I use Have I Been Pwned (haveibeenpwned.com) and Dehashed 
(dehashed.com) in order to identify online accounts associated with a target email address. While HIBP does 
not always work with usernames, Dehashed performs well. Similar to the previous instruction, enter your target's 
username with the intent to discover any data breaches which include these details. The custom search tool 
contains multiple breach queries, as I find that information to be the most valuable at the beginning of an 
investigation. If my target username is "inteltechniques", I find the following direct query URL to be most 
beneficial for username search. This should look familiar to the options presented in the previous chapter.

In the previous chapter, I explained this email search sendee and the requirement for a free API key in order to

Let's take a look at the Twitter result for my own name. It immediately7 identified the three locations which have 
been present within my' Twitter profile over the past decade, as follows. I am not aware of any other service 
which could replicate this data going back to 2009.

compromised database. Unfortunately, this manual search is time consuming and takes a lot of redundant effort. 
Therefore, consider using this option within the custom search tools.
Similar to how compromised database searches are the most powerful email search option that I use, querying 
usernames in this manner can be equally important This search tool eliminates any laborious process and 
removes any excuses not to conduct this type of search every time.
Identifying a Skype username can be an important lead. It could direct you toward additional searches of the 
newly found data. Unfortunately, usernames are not obviously available when researching a real name on Skype.
The previous option made assumptions about usernames within email addresses which may appear on breach 
search sites. We can replicate that method within a standard search engine. The following URL populates a 
search on Google of the target username with the addition of the most popular email address domains, including 
quotation marks and the OR operator, as previously discussed. If your target username is IntelTechniques, you 
could manually' conduct the following Google search.
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL
If desired, you could copy' this query’ and paste it into Bing and Yandex, but 1 have found the results to be very’ 
unreliable. Your custom search tool makes this much easier. Enter your username in the "Email Search" option 
at the end in order to replicate this search. It will usually generate the most results the fastest.
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL 
PI:EMAIL 
PI:EMAIL
PI:EMAIL
Any positive results indicate that an address exists matching the search criteria, and that address was present 
within a breach. If you look at the code behind the tools, it appears as follows.
setTimeout(functionO{window.open(’https://dehashed.com/search?query=%22' + all3 + '@gmail.com%22', 
'lleak3window*);},1000);
"PI:EMAIL"OR"PI:EMAIL"OR"PI:EMAIL"OR"In
PI:EMAIL”OR"PI:EMAIL"OR
"PI:EMAIL"OR'PI:EMAIL"OR"PI:EMAIL"OR"Inte
PI:EMAIL"OR"PI:EMAIL"OR"PI:EMAIL"
These tools contain two search fields near the bottom of the page. Each queries a provided username through 
HIBP and Dehashed. The code appends the most popular email domains after the supplied username, and 
conducts a search within a new tab for each. If you provide IntelTechniques as the target username, the following 
email addresses are queried within independent browser tabs.
The Timeout function places a short pause in between searches. This ensures that we do not upset the server 
by conducting too many’ automated queries at once. If desired, you could replace "gmail.com", or any other 
options, with an email provider more appropriate for your investigations. If you are outside the U.S., you may 
want to replace several of these. You could also add more at the end. If I were to add "qq.com" after the last 
option, it would appear as follows. The 35000 is the next Timeout option to ensure that we have 3000 
milliseconds in between each search execution.

However, a quick method will reveal any Skype username when searching by name or email address. VCHiile 
logged in to a Skype account within the website or application, navigate to the search area. This section allows 
you to enter a real name or email address, and then conducts a search of the Skype user directory'. Any results 
will appear immediately below. Clicking on these results displays the user's basic profile details including a photo. 
If the user chose not to include a photo, a silhouette graphic appears. Right-click on either image format and 
choose to "Open image in a new tab" (Chrome) or "View image" (Firefox). The new tab will contain the image 
that was already available. However, the address in the URL will reveal the Skype username of the target.
Similar to the custom email search tool, this page assists with an automated search of some of the techniques 
mentioned previously. This page, seen in Figure 16.01, allows you to execute manual queries or use the option 
to attempt all search possibilities. As a reminder, you must allow pop-ups for these pages if you want to use the 
'Submit Ail" option and an API key must be added to conduct queries through People Data Labs.

This indicates that the naming convention for personal websites is a tilde (~) followed by the first initial and 
then the first six letters of the last name. If the target of interest was ’’Scott Golike", the personal website would 
probably be at www.siue.edu/~sgolike/.
If you can identify the convention that the school uses and know the full name of the target, you can often 
determine the email address of the student. This address can be searched in order to identify any social networks 
that may have been missed. Furthermore, the first part of that address is usually the username that would have 
been issued to the student for a homepage. The target may have never used this email address online and a 
search result may appear empty. That does not mean there is not data available. The chance that the target 
created some type of homepage while attending the university is high. Finding the content is easy.
These automated searches for usernames can be very productive. However, they will not locate accounts within 
all online communities. One large untapped resource is the massive presence of university personal web pages 
and usernames. Most universities issue each student a university email address. These usually follow a standard 
naming convention such as the following.
I picked the name of Laura at random just to identify any student or employee personal website on the SILE 
domain. One of the results was a link to a personal website belonging to "Laura Swanson". The link was similar 
to www.siue.edu/~lswanso/.
As an example, I can navigate to the first personal link for "Laura Swanson". Figure 16.02 (first) displays a 
portion of the live page at x\Avw.siue.edu/~lswanso/. If this page did not exist and the site contained no content, 
you could check on The Wayback Machine. Figure 16.02 (second) shows the search results for this personal 
page and identifies numerous archives dating back to 1997 for this site. Checking all of these options presents 
the many different versions of the site including one from 2005, as seen in Figure 16.02 (third), and the first 
capture from 1997, as seen in Figure 16.02 (fourth). This presents new data that would not have been uncovered 
with conventional searches. When a personal website is located, earlier versions should be archived.
Hopefully, the searches explained earlier have helped in identifying a university that the target attended. A search 
for the university's website will reveal the domain name that the university uses. For example, Southern Illinois 
University at Edwardsville's website is siue.edu. We can now take that information and conduct a specific search 
for any personal pages on their domain. The search should similar to site:siue.edu laura.
Real World Application: While assisting another agency, information had developed in regard to a suspect in 
a priority investigation. After all online search attempts revealed nothing of value in locating the subject, a deleted 
student personal page was located using this method. It contained a list of friends, roommates, family members, 
and interests that were not previously known. This information helped locate the individual within hours.
We can also assume the possibility’ of his school issued email account to be sgolikc@siue.edu. A few searches 
using previously discussed techniques should confirm if this address belongs to the target A search using the 
email to Facebook profile technique may identify’ an abandoned profile. We can now navigate to this personal 
school page and see if there is any content If there is, we can collect the data and conduct an analysis for 
intelligence and further research leads. If there is no page at this address, it does not mean that there has never 
been data there. This only indicates that there is no current content on this website. When students graduate, 
universities will usually remove all of the personal content from the servers. As discussed previously, this is 
never an excuse to stop looking. You can now take the URL of a target and conduct a search on The Wayback 
Machine (wayback.archive.org).
