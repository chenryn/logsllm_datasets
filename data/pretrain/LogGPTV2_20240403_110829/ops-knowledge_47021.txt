User: I just installed a linux system (Kubuntu) and was wondering if there is a program to make python programs executable for linux.
Assistant: I do the following:

put #! /usr/bin/env python3 at top of script
chmod u+x file.py
Change .py to .command in file name

This essentially turns the file into a bash executable. When you double-click it, it should run. This works in Unix-based systems.
