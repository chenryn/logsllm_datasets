Figure 12: Eavesdropping Performance
For the simulation, we simulate different channel models in
GNU radio, in which the eavesdropper moves at a speed of 1m/s to
simulate the walking process in frequency selective fading model
(Rayleigh and Rician). Fig. 12(a) and Fig. 12(b) show the SER and
PER results respectively. From Fig. 12(a), we can find that the SER
decreases steadily with the increase of SNR. With the same SNR,
the AWGN channel model usually has a lower SER. From Fig. 12(b),
we can find that the PER also decreases with the increase of SNR,
and the decrease occurred in frequency selective fading channel
is later than that in the AWGN channel. This is due to the ZigBee
device has a relatively low transmission rate so that it is easier to
be affected by the movement.
For the field experiment, we evaluate three factors’ impact on
decoding accuracy, including the distance, transmission power, and
SNR. We use three USRPs as the sender, receiver and noise generator
respectively, as given in Fig. 12(c). We carry out the experiment by
changing the distance between the sender and receiver from 1m to
10m and adjusting the transmission power from -20dBm to -70dBm.
All ZigBee signal can be decoded correctly, which demonstrates the
accuracy and effectiveness of the delimiting and decoding mech-
anisms proposed in Sec. 3.2 and 3.3. In Fig. 12(d), we show the
variation of communication effect with different SNR. When the
SNR is greater than 3.1dB, the SER and PER remain at ’0’ or very
small. When the SNR is smaller than 1.94dB, SER and PER begin
to increase significantly. The above experiments demonstrate the
accuracy of the proposed eavesdropping process.
5.2.2 Attacking Performance. We carry out similar experiments
and evaluate the same factors to demonstrate the attacking per-
formance. Specifically, we let attacker send 100 emulated packets,
each of which contains 60 symbols, and measure the SER and PER
at the victim side.
For the simulation, attacker moves at a speed of 1m/s in fre-
quency selective fading model. From Fig. 13(a) and Fig. 13(b), it can
be seen that the SER and PER decrease with the increase of SNR.
Different to Fig. 12(a) and Fig. 12(b), the decrease of these three
models are synchronized, which means the emulated signal has a
good performance in frequency selective fading channel, because
it is a WiFi-based signal.
For the field experiments, we evaluate the three factors as men-
tioned in Sec. 5.2.1. We use a TI CC26X2R1 launchpad as the receiver,
two USRPs as the sender and noise generator respectively, as given
in Fig. 13(c). We vary the distance from 1m to 10m and find that
the variation of SER and PER are irregular but the absolute values
of them are not very large, as shown in Fig.13(d). This is because
10m is totally in the coverage of signal. Within this range, errors
are mostly caused by multi-path effect and random noise. Then, we
adjust the transmission power and test the attacking performance
with different RSSI (-20dBm∼-90dBm). Fig. 13(e) shows that from
-20dBm to -80dBm, the SER and PER do not change obviously, but
they increase dramatically at -90dBm, which indicates that at the
limit of communication capability, there exists significant perfor-
mance degradation. Finally, we test the attacking performance with
different SNRs. In Fig. 13(f), the SER and PER decrease with the
increase of SNR, although some fluctuations may exist due to the
random noise. Besides, we find that if PER is significantly greater
than the corresponding SER, then, the wrong symbols are often
scattered in different packets. If PER is similar to the corresponding
SER, then, wrong symbols are more concentrated.
5.3 AuthCTC Performance
In this subsection, we evaluate the defensive performance of Au-
thCTC. As a defense mechanism, if the detector can extract the
authorization code accurately from the received packet, it can de-
cide whether the packet is legitimate accurately. Thus, we let the
legitimate CTC device send 10000 emulated packets with specified
authorization code embedded in their preambles. Then, we mea-
sure how many authorization codes can be decoded correctly at
the detector side.
For the simulation, we measure the decoding accuracy with
different Δ and C. Fig. 14(a) shows the result of decoding accuracy
under different Δ and SNR. The decoding accuracy increases with
the increase of SNR. When the SNR is larger than 15dB, the decoding
accuracy is higher than 90%. Besides, the decoding accuracy also
increases with the increase of Δ, because when the interval of
