# The Tor Project

## Mission
The Tor Project aims to be the global resource for technology, advocacy, research, and education in the ongoing pursuit of freedom of speech, privacy rights online, and censorship circumvention.

## Key Features
- **Online Anonymity**
  - **Open Source**: Transparent and accessible code.
  - **Open Network**: A decentralized network that anyone can join.
- **Community**: A vibrant community of researchers, developers, users, and relay operators.
- **Non-Profit Organization**: Registered as a U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

## User Base
- Estimated daily Tor users: 2,000,000 to 8,000,000

## Threat Model
- **What Can an Attacker Do?**
  - **Alice** and **Bob** communicate through an anonymity network.
  - An attacker can:
    - Watch Alice or Bob.
    - Control part of the network.

## Anonymity vs. Encryption
- **Anonymity** is not the same as **encryption**. Encryption protects the contents of a message, but it does not hide the identities of the sender and receiver.
  - **Example**:
    - **Alice**: "Hi, Bob!"
    - **Bob**: "Hi, Bob!"
    - **Attacker**: Sees the message but not the identities.

## Different Interests in Anonymity
- **Private Citizens**: Anonymity is about privacy.
- **Businesses**: Anonymity is about network security.
- **Governments**: Anonymity is about traffic-analysis resistance.
- **Human Rights Activists**: Anonymity is about reachability.

## Safety and Diversity
- **Diversity of Relays**: More relays and greater diversity reduce the risk of traffic confirmation attacks.
  - **Research Problem**: Measuring diversity over time.
- **Diversity of Users and Reasons**: A large and varied user base makes it harder for attackers to target specific groups.

## Transparency
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Open Source/Free Software**: Transparent and open code.
  - **Public Design Documents and Specifications**: Accessible documentation.
  - **Publicly Identified Developers**: Known contributors.
  - **Privacy by Choice**: Not a contradiction; privacy is about giving users control.

## Censorship Epochs
- **Phase 1 (2006-2011)**: Bridges and pluggable transports.
- **Phase 2 (2011-2019)**: Active probing, obfsproxy, domain fronting, and more countries.
- **Phase 3 (2019-?)**: Snowflake, obfs4, decoy routing, etc.

## Relay and Discovery
- **Proxying Schemes**:
  - **Relay Component**: Building circuits, sending traffic, and ensuring cryptographic security.
  - **Discovery Component**: Learning which relays are available.

## Directory Protocol
- **Basic Design**:
  - **Trusted Directory**: Relays publish self-signed descriptors.
  - **Authorities**: Publish a consensus list of all descriptors.
  - **Users**: Download the consensus and descriptors from anywhere.

## Early Blocking
- **2006**: Thailand blocks the website by DNS.
- **2007**: Iran, Saudi Arabia, and others use websense/smartfilter to block HTTP directory fetches.
  - **Fix**: Encapsulate everything inside TLS.

## Throttling SSL
- **June 2009**: Iran throttles SSL bandwidth by DPI.
  - **Solution**: Make Tor's TLS handshake look like Firefox+Apache, making it indistinguishable from regular traffic.

## Attackers' Strategies
- **Blocking Users**:
  - Block directory authorities.
  - Block relay IP addresses.
  - Filter based on Tor's network fingerprint.
  - Prevent users from finding the Tor software (e.g., by blocking the website).

## Finding Bridges
- **Methods**:
  - Visit https://bridges.torproject.org/ for a few bridges based on time and IP address.
  - Email PI:EMAIL from a Gmail address for a few bridges.
  - Distribute bridges via social networks.
  - Set up your own private bridge and inform target users directly.

## Censorship in China
- **September 2009**: China blocked public relays and one of the three bridge buckets.
- **March 2010**: China enumerated the second bridge bucket, leaving only social network distribution and private bridges.
- **October 2011**: China started active probing with DPI and later targeted obfs2 and obfs3.
- **March 2015**: "Great Cannon" targets GitHub.
- **Pre-2018**: China shifted to blackholing entire IP addresses.
- **Mid-2018**: Lantern uses obfs4 proxies, and China throttles, not blocks, identified obfs4 bridges.
- **Mid-2019**: Changes in advertised ciphersuites on the client side reduced active probing.

## New Pluggable Transports
- **Snowflake**: A new pluggable transport.
- **obfs4**: Requires clients to prove knowledge of a secret to prevent spoofing.

## Streamlined Deployment
- **obfs4proxy**: Install with `apt install obfs4proxy`.
- **Future**: Consider `apt install tor-bridge` for easier deployment.
- **Details**: See [PluggableTransports/obfs4proxy](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/obfs4proxy).

## BridgeDB Feedback Cycle
- **Measure Use and Blocking**: Track bridge usage and blocking.
- **Adapt Distribution**: Favor efficient distribution channels.
- **Innovate**: Develop new distribution methods, such as Salmon from PETS 2015.

## Measuring Reachability
- **Passive**: Bridges track incoming connections by country; clients self-report blockage.
- **Active**: Scan bridges from within the country or measure remotely via indirect scanning.
- **Duplex Blocking**: Bridges test for both inbound and outbound blocking.

## OONI
- **ooni.torproject.org**: Measure internet censorship and surveillance.
- **explorer.ooni.torproject.org**: Explore and analyze data.

## Upcoming Designs
- **FTE/Marionette**: Transform traffic payloads using regex or state machines.
- **Decoy Routing**: Inject responses from the middle by running a tap at an ISP.

## Arms Races
- **Censorship and Surveillance**: Centralization of the Internet exacerbates these issues.

## How You Can Help
- **Run an obfs4 Bridge and a Snowflake**.
- **Teach Others**: Educate friends about Tor and privacy.
- **Find and Fix Bugs**.
- **Contribute to Research**: Work on open research problems (petsymposium.org).
- **Donate**: Support the project at donate.torproject.org.
