Question: Consider a simplified symmetric-key encryption scenario where the encryption of a plaintext is performed by XORing each bit with a corresponding bit of a key. If an attacker knows the ciphertext and has knowledge of the XOR properties, which of the following statements are true about the attacker's potential actions?
"A": "The attacker can determine the original plaintext if they also have access to the key, by XORing the ciphertext with the key.",
"B": "The attacker can produce any plaintext of their choosing by manipulating the ciphertext, regardless of the key.",
"C": "The attacker can deduce the key if they have access to both the plaintext and the ciphertext.",
"D": "The attacker can generate a valid ciphertext without knowing the key by guessing the plaintext and applying the identity property."
Answer: AC
