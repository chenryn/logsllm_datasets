# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I like to use multiple desktops, I have one for Work and another for Home
time. I would love if I could specify certain apps to always open on a
designated desktop. For example, all my work needs to be done in Chrome, but I
use Firefox as my personal browser. I'd love if I could tell Chrome to always
open on the Work desktop and Firefox to always open on the Home desktop.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I'm open to methods on how to assign this kind of thing to a window. Maybe add
a right click option to windows that appear when I WinKey+Tab that lets me
"pin" it to a specific desktop?
