### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

I frequently use multiple desktops to separate my work and personal activities. For instance, I have one desktop dedicated to work and another for personal use. It would be highly beneficial if I could specify certain applications to always open on a designated desktop. For example, I use Google Chrome for all my work-related tasks and Firefox for personal browsing. I would like to be able to configure Chrome to always open on the Work desktop and Firefox to always open on the Home desktop.

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

I am open to various methods for assigning applications to specific desktops. One possible approach could be to add a right-click context menu option to application windows that appear when using the WinKey+Tab shortcut. This context menu could include an option to "pin" the application to a specific desktop. This would allow users to easily manage which applications are associated with each desktop.
