User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Munin "Disk usage" is too high? I've recently installed munin on my VMware client server and saw that the Disk usage shows about 80-90%. Everything else (cpu load, ram, etc.) seems to be running fine. I have only two virtual hosts on my server with 1000 users/day in total, so I don't think that's too much.

Here is the graph for the disk usage.

Server info: Debian Lenny, CPU 510Mhz, RAM 512MB

Is it bad? What could possibly cause this?

Thank you for any suggestions.

Assistant: The /var directory is used for various things which can cause this. For example a log file, mail queue or database. You can use the command du to see which directory is taking most of the disk space and take appropriate actions.

du -h --max-depth=2 /var
