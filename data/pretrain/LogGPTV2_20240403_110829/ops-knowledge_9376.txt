If you're interested in exploring Google App Engine (GAE) with Python, there are several excellent tools and integrated development environments (IDEs) that can enhance your development experience. While NetBeans does offer support for Python, other IDEs and tools may be more specifically tailored to GAE and Python development. Here are a few top recommendations:

1. **PyCharm**: This is one of the most popular IDEs for Python development. It offers robust support for GAE, including integration, debugging, and deployment features.

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: With the right extensions, VS Code can be a powerful tool for GAE and Python. Extensions like "Python" by Microsoft and "Google Cloud Tools" provide comprehensive support for GAE development.

3. **Google Cloud SDK**: Essential for working with GAE, the Google Cloud SDK includes command-line tools that allow you to deploy, manage, and monitor your applications.

4. **IntelliJ IDEA**: Another JetBrains product, IntelliJ IDEA, also supports GAE and provides a rich set of features for Python development.

5. **Eclipse with PyDev**: If you prefer Eclipse, the PyDev plugin adds Python support and can be configured to work well with GAE.

These tools will help you get started and streamline your development process with GAE and Python. Happy coding!
