User: I'm trying to compile PyPy on cygwin, and the compilation stops when python tries to open the file "externmod", which was just compiled with gcc.  The problem with gcc on cygwin is that it automatically appends a '.exe' to whatever you're compiling, so even though gcc is called as gcc -shared -Wl,--enable-auto-image-base -pthread -o /tmp/usession-release-1.8/shared_cache/externmod, the output file ends up being externmod.exe regardless.  So python tries to open /tmp/usession-release-1.8/shared_cache/externmod and can't find it--thus the compilation stops.  Anyone know how to solve this, short of recompiling gcc?  I don't  want to do that.
Assistant: Windows needs the ".exe" extension to know that it's executable. You'll need to modify the build to look for Windows and use the .exe extension.
