User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx root not working as I expected I am trying to achieve the following:

The root of my domain http://www.paulix.local/ should server the file located at /var/www/html/main/webroot/index.php

The url http://www.paulix.local/malibushould serve the file located at /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot/index.php

The rewrite I am trying to achieve (url => script) :


/ => /var/www/html/main/webroot/index.php
/path/whatever => /var/www/html/main/webroot/index.php?/path/whatever
/malibu => /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot/index.php
/malibu/path/whatever => /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot/index.php?/path/whatever


This is my current config

server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;

    rewrite_log on;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/paulix-access.log;
    error_log  /var/log/nginx/paulix-errors.log notice;

    server_name www.paulix.local;
    root /var/www/html/main/webroot;
    index index.php;

    # location 1
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    # location 2
    location ~ /malibu {
        root /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot;
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;

        # location 3
        location ~ \.php$ {
            return 200 "Malibu is $document_root$fastcgi_script_name";
        }
    }

    # location 4
    location ~ \.php$ {
            return 200 "Global $document_root$fastcgi_script_name";
    }
}


If I hit the url http://www.paulix.local, it hits location 4 and I get the following output: Global /var/www/html/main/webroot/index.php which is what I'm expecting.

PROBLEMS

If I hit the url http://www.paulix.local/malibu it also hits location 4 with the same output as above, but I was expecting it to hit location 3, the expected output being: Malibu is /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot/index.php

Lastly, hitting http://www.paulix.local/malibu/index.php hits location 3, but not with the expected output. It outputs Malibu is /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot/malibu/index.php when I'd like it to be /var/www/domain/malibu/webroot/index.php

Assistant: Based on your needs, use location /malibu { or location ^~ /malibu {instead of location ~ /malibu {.

Here you can read an understandable overview how Nginx deals with location-blocks. 

edit: Sorry, I haven't seen your last edit as I wrote my answer. I think it is alias you are searching for. Just replace root in location 2 with alias and the output should be fine. (Source)
