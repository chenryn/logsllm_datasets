As a user, when I open more than two tabs in the default terminal size, I must
maximize\resize the window to access the nth tab. There is no horizontal
scrolling support.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
This is a feature that is supported within VS Code and should be extended to
windows terminal.
When more tabs are open than what is supported by the current view, provide
horizontal scrolling of the tabs to allow the user to select the nth terminal
tab.
