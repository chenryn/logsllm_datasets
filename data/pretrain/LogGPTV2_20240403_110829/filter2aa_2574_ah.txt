 Hiding Tor Usage
An important point that should be carefully considered is hiding the usage of the 
Tor Browser from your ISP. This step is essential because using Tor Browser could 
be considered suspicious and even illegal in some countries. Other countries—and 
ISPs—may forbid access to the Tor Network. This will make using the Tor Browser more 
difficult for novice users.

Detecting Tor usage is feasible using a variety of technical methods. However, in this 
section, we will introduce some techniques to conceal your Tor usage to a large extent, 
which makes detecting it difficult.
Using a VPN
You can hide Tor usage from your ISP by using a virtual private network service. The VPN 
will create an encrypted tunnel between your machine and the VPN server. Once that’s 
initiated, you can launch the Tor Browser, which will be hidden from your ISP to a large 
extent.
Using Tor Bridges
Bridge relays (or bridges for short) are Tor relays that aren’t listed in the main Tor 
directory. Bridges are considered entry points to the Tor Network. Since there is no 
complete public list of them, even if your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor 
relays, it probably won’t be able to block all the bridges.
Please remember that this method may not fully guarantee that your ISP will not 
detect your Tor usage, but it will make discovering this fact difficult and will require 
sophisticated techniques to uncover. To get Tor bridges, do one of the following:
• 
Go to https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges and get your 
bridges.
• 
Send an email to PI:EMAIL with the line “get bridges” 
by itself in the body of the email. You must send this email from one 
of the following email providers: Riseup, Gmail, or Yahoo.
Now, you need to configure the Tor Browser to use these bridges. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 1. To enter bridges into the Tor Browser, launch the Tor Browser, and 
before the Tor Browser connects, click the Open Settings button 
(see Figure 2-23).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
73
 2. A Tor Network Settings window appears; click the Configure 
button.
 3. Tor asks you whether your ISP is blocking or otherwise censoring 
connections to the Tor Network; click Yes and click Next to 
continue.
 4. In the next wizard window, select the option “Enter custom 
bridges” (see Figure 2-24). Copy the bridges you have from step 1 
or step 2 and paste them in the box; click Next to continue.

 5. The next wizard asks you whether your computer sits behind a 
proxy server; in our case, you don’t need one (which is the most 
common). Select No and click the Connect button to continue. If 
you are sitting behind a proxy server, select Yes, then enter your 
proxy settings, and finally click Connect.
If everything works as expected, the Tor Browser will open using the customized 
bridges.
As we have already introduced, using customized Tor bridges may not fully mask 
your entry to the Tor Network. Some countries use a deep packet inspection (DPI) 
technique to analyze Internet traffic flows by protocol to examine whether they contain 
Tor traffic. However, using customized bridges is still a good way to circumvent Tor 
censorship and conceal its usage in many countries.
Using Pluggable Transports
To work around the DPI censorship technique, Tor has introduced the pluggable 
transport (PT). This technique transforms the traffic between your computer and the 
bridge into typical Internet traffic, thus hiding your Tor usage from your ISP. To use a 
pluggable transport, do the following:
 1. Launch the Tor Browser and click the Open Settings button before 
Tor starts.
 2. Click the Configure button, select the Yes option when asked 
whether your ISP blocks or censors connections to the Tor 
Network, and click Next to continue.
 3. Select the option “Connect with provided bridges” and select a 
bridge from the Transport Type drop-down menu (see Figure 2-25).

 4. The final wizard window will ask you whether this computer sits 
behind a proxy server. In our case, it does not, so you can select 
the No option and click the Connect button. If you are sitting 
behind a proxy server, select Yes, enter your proxy settings, and 
click the Connect button.
If everything goes well, the Tor Browser should now be able to load successfully.
Warning! What should you do to stay anonymous when using the Tor Browser?
1. 
 do not install add-ons in your Tor Browser such as Flash player, 
adobe reader, and QuickTime player. Such extensions tend to open 
independent connections outside the Tor circuit, and this will leak 
your real Ip address.
2. 
do not open pdF files or play Flash video within your Tor Browser.

3. 
 If you are exchanging sensitive data through the Tor Network, make 
sure to encrypt it first. The Tor exit relay—which is used to establish 
the connection with the destination—is not encrypted. If an intruder 
sits at that location, he can intercept your connection.
4. 
 make sure when using the Tor Browser to not use your real identity 
to register or post comments on websites. Of course, as an OSINT 
analyzer, keeping your identity secret is the main reason to use the 
Tor Network.
 Using the Tails OS and Other Security OSs
Sometimes you may want to achieve the highest anonymity possible through using a 
specialized OS that directs all Internet traffic through the Tor Network. The Tor Browser 
is more than enough for concealing your identity when conducting regular OSINT 
searches; however, when working on sensitive cases or exchanging information with 
other parties, it is necessary to use an anonymous OS.
Tails is a Linux security-hardened OS that uses Tor as its default networking 
application. It is considered the best anonymous OS currently available, and for the 
record, this is the OS that Edward Snowden used to help stay anonymous during the 
initial NSA spying leaks. You can use Tails to communicate privately with confidence in 
extremely hostile environments.
Tails is portable. Hence, you can execute it from within your USB stick drive, and it 
is fully independent of the host machine. Tails runs using the host machine’s RAM and 
does not copy any files to the resident host machine’s hard disk.
Tails achieves its anonymity by forcing all network connections to go through the 
Tor Network. If an application tries to connect to the Internet directly, the connection 
is automatically blocked. Tails leaves no traces on the host machine’s hard disk. Upon 
shutdown, Tails will delete all user files, unless explicitly asked not to (persistent 
storage). Tails comes with many cryptographic tools that allow you to send encrypted 
emails and have secure IM chats.
We will cover installing and using Tails in Chapter 3.

 Sharing Files Securely
Sometimes you may want to share files privately with other parties located in another 
location. This is especially important for any OSINT analyst who may need to request 
and share information with colleagues to support a case. There are numerous file- 
sharing services, but the majority are not built to be completely anonymous. They 
usually require an account to share files and store some information (also called 
transaction metadata, which includes uploader and downloader IP addresses among 
other things) about each transaction happening through them. Such a thing is not 
suitable for investigators working on sensitive legal cases. In this section, we will 
introduce a secure file-sharing service through the Tor Network; it is considered the 
most anonymous solution to exchange private files online.
 OnionShare
OnionShare is an open source tool that uses the Tor Network to share files anonymously. 
You can share any type and size of files. Your shared files will not get uploaded to the 
Internet. Instead, they will remain on your computer, which plays the role of a hosting 
service. All you need to do to share files is to share the URL given by the tool to the 
person you are corresponding with who should access it using the Tor Browser.
To use OnionShare, follow these steps:
 1. Download and install the program from https://onionshare.org.
 2. Launch the tool and select the files/folders you want to share. 
Make sure your Tor Browser is launched and connected to the Tor 
Network.
 3. After selecting which files/folders you want to share, click the 
Start Sharing button. OnionShare will create a hidden Tor service 
for your shared files hosted on the Tor Network and will give you 
a URL to send to your correspondent. You can get this URL by 
clicking the Copy URL button (see Figure 2-26).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS

 4. Your correspondent must access the shared URL through the Tor 
Browser.
 5. Your OnionShare program and the Tor Browser should remain 
open until your correspondent finishes downloading your 
shared files. When the recipient receives your file successfully, 
OnionShare will stop the sharing process automatically. (To stop 
sharing automatically after the recipient receives the file, you must 
enable the option “Stop sharing automatically” in the OnionShare 
program before sharing files.)
Note! For security-conscious people who want to share sensitive files, we advise 
you to use the Tails OS when sharing files through the OnionShare program.

recipient, and keeps it private

 Making Anonymous Payments
As an OSINT analyzer, during your search for OSINT sources, you may encounter 
websites that request you pay a fee to see some resources (mainly gray literature). 
This frequently happens when requesting academic papers or a corporation’s internal 
documents. The same thing applies when buying anonymity services online (e.g., paying 
for a VPN provider anonymously). As you know, you may be part of a legal investigation 
and do not want to reveal your real identity when investigating some types of resources. 
In such cases, it is necessary to pay for such services anonymously.
In ordinary cases, when you purchase something online, your name, credit card 
information, and other transaction details will be available to the online merchant. 
Your credit card issuer and the bank will also know about your transaction details, and 
no one can guarantee how long these details will remain stored and whether any third 
party (e.g., advertisement agency) may have access to it. To purchase digital goods 
and services online anonymously, you can either use a gift credit card or pay using 
cryptocurrency.
 Prepaid Gift Card
Major credit card providers offer prepaid cards for their customers. Such cards do not 
require any personal information to set up; they also do not require the existence of a 
bank account to work. Such cards are available in drugstores and supermarkets and 
are used specifically to purchase digital goods like VPNs and other anonymity services 
(although please note that not all websites accept such cards).
There are different types of prepaid cards. What we care about for this book is the 
anonymous type, which is the “nonreloadable” card. This card comes preloaded with 
a specific amount of cash—usually less than $500. You can purchase them with cash 
(which is untraceable) without revealing any personal information; even your e-mail 
address is not required.
Warning! do not buy prepaid credit cards online. If you buy a prepaid credit card 
online, you need to pay for it using some form of nonanonymous payment like an 
ordinary credit card, a bank check, or paypal. In addition, you need to supply your 
postal address to receive the card (if it is a physical plastic card). This will link the 
purchased credit card to your real identity.

 Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that is designed to work as a medium of 
exchange using cryptography to secure the transaction and to control the creation of 
additional units of currency. There are hundreds of cryptocurrency types already in 
use; the most famous is still the bitcoin system. You can find a list of currently available 
cryptocurrency at https://coinmarketcap.com.
Bitcoin (https://bitcoin.org) is a decentralized and unregulated peer-to-peer 
payment network (like the Torrent network) that is powered by its users with no central 
authority or middleman. Bitcoin is a digital system; it is not printed like ordinary 
currency (dollars and euros) and is created by people and companies using a specialized 
open source software program called a bitcoin wallet (the wallet can be an online 
service; hence, it is called an e-wallet). Bitcoin does not charge fees on transactions, and 
it is nonrefundable (once you send bitcoin to a recipient, it will be gone forever unless 
the recipient returns the bitcoin to you).
We will not delve deeply into the technical side of the bitcoin digital currency and 
how to set up an account to buy products using it because it is out of the book’s scope. 
What you should know about bitcoin is that you can make anonymous purchases using 
this currency that are near impossible to uncover. In the following list, we will give you 
some reputable online sources to understand how this currency works.

Bitcoin payments are extremely anonymous; however, there is a bit of a learning 
curve for buying and exchanging bitcoin.
Before moving on, consider the following when conducting anonymous purchases online:
• 
Encrypt your online connection before making an anonymous 
payment. When paying anonymously online, make sure to 
anonymize your connection using an anonymizing network like Tor 
or I2P. Paying anonymously without masking your IP address will 
expose your technical connection details to different parties, and this 
may lead to revealing your identity.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
81
• 
Registering for anonymity services, like a VPN, and even conducting 
some online purchases using an anonymous payment method may 
require users to supply their e-mail address as part of the transaction. 
Make sure not to use your primary email address; instead, use a 
temporary email address for such tasks.
 Encryption Techniques
Encryption provides a robust set of techniques to ensure secure transactional sensitive 
data flows online, thus preventing hackers and cybercriminals from accessing sensitive 
content, even if they succeed in capturing the transmitted encrypted data. The 
mathematical formulas involved in today’s cryptographic standards are enough to 
prevent most attackers from decrypting stolen data. In this section, we will present some 
tools and advice that helps you to keep your confidential data private by encrypting it.
 Securing Your Passwords
Make sure to secure your online accounts using strong, complex passwords. It is also 
highly recommended to change your password every three months. There are many 
free tools to aid you in the password generation process. Such tools will produce highly 
secure passwords that contain a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Here is a 
list of some of these tools:
• 
Free Password Generator (https://www.securesafepro.com/
pasgen.html)
• 
PWGen (http://pwgen-win.sourceforge.net)
Many websites offer online password generation services. However, we prefer not to 
use such services because your password can be intercepted while traveling to your PC.
To store your passwords, you should use a security program to keep them safe; using 
a password manager program is essential to keep all your passwords in a safe location. A 
password manager encrypts the database that contains your credentials and protects it 
with a master password. This is the only password you must remember.

 Encrypting Your Hard Drive/USB Sticks
Encrypting data becomes essential in today’s digital age as it considered the last line of 
defense if an attacker successfully gains access to your confidential data. In other words, 
encryption will be your last hope to prevent the compromise, use, or disclosure of your 
sensitive information to the public or to your enemies.
Keeping stored information on a hard drive secure is easy when using encryption 
software. For instance, Windows provides a built-in encryption utility that is available 
for most of its versions (Windows 7 and beyond) called BitLocker. Using this utility is 
easy; all you need to do is to right-click the drive you want to encrypt and select Turn on 
BitLocker (see Figure 2-27). A wizard will appear that walks you through all the steps to 
configure your drive encryption (setting a password and storing a recovery key).
Figure 2-27. Activate BitLocker on a Windows box
There are many reputable disk encryption software applications that provide disk 
and even OS partition encryption.
VeraCrypt (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) is supported on all major 
OSs. It can encrypt hard drives including OS partitions and USB stick drives. VeraCrypt 
also creates encrypted vaults that can be used to store data and then transfer it into a 
USB stick or send it over the Internet securely. You can check the documentation section 
for how to use this tool in different scenarios.
DiskCryptor (https://diskcryptor.net/wiki/Main_Page) offers encryption of all 
disk partitions, including the system partition. It is supported only on Windows OS.
 Cloud Storage Security
Most people are using cloud storage to back up and store their sensitive data 
(such as documents, personal pictures, contact lists, address books, and the like). 
The many security incidents that have taken place lately with major cloud service 
providers shows that their security measures alone may not be enough to stop such 
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
83
compromises. To counter such risks, don’t rely on the cloud service provider to secure 
your data. Always encrypt your data before uploading it to the cloud and make sure to 
have a backup copy stored somewhere else when dealing with sensitive data. Here are 
two programs that can be used to secure your data before uploading it to the cloud:
 1. Duplicati (https://www.duplicati.com) uses AES-256 or GPG to 
encrypt your data before sending it to the cloud.
 2. Cryptomator (https://cryptomator.org) uses AES-256 to 
encrypt your data and uses SCRYPT to protect against brute-force 
attacks. It works by creating an encrypted vault—a virtual hard 
drive—on your local machine that encrypts everything inside it 
before uploading it to the cloud provider.
Please note that compression programs like 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org) and PeaZip  
(www.peazip.org) also offer encryption features, so you can compress and protect your 
files with a password before uploading it to the cloud.
 Secure E-mail Communications
Whenever an e-mail is sent, it should be encrypted to assure the integrity and 
confidentiality of its contents. In today’s digital age, e-mail becomes the main means of 
communications for both individuals and public/private organizations, and breaching 
this communication medium would have a serious consequence. E-mail data breaches 
occur daily to assure that the contents of your emails are secure, so you should use 
encryption software.
Detailing how to incorporate encryption in your e-mails is beyond this book’s scope. 
However, in this context, you should understand that when sharing information with 
colleagues (e.g., as part of your OSINT investigation) through e-mails, you should take 
care to encrypt it first. In this section, we will give you resources and tools to learn how 
to do this. However, if you want to understand the ins and outs of e-mail encryption, 
you should check out our book Digital Privacy and Security Using Windows: A Practical 
Guide (Apress, 2017).
• 
Gpg4win (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) allows you to create 
cryptographic keys (public and private keys), encrypt files and 
folders, and sign your e-mails before sending (digital signature).
