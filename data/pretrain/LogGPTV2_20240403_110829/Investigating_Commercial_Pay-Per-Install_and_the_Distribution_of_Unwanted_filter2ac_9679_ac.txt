suming all of the installs we observed originate from af-
filiates, it is unclear how each anti-virus operator polices
abuse in the face of an increasingly tangled web of pur-
chased installs and potentially dubious distribution prac-
tices. Equally problematic, PPI downloaders simultane-
ously install these anti-virus products alongside browser
settings hijackers and ad injectors—an unenviable user
experience.
Major Brands: We observe a small number of major
software brands including Opera, Skype, and browser
toolbars distributed via PPI. Based on the affiliate codes
embedded in the download URLs for Opera, it appears
that Opera directly interacts with PPI operators to pur-
chase installs rather than relying on intermediate affili-
ates.1 The other three programs all operate affiliate pro-

Table 4: Software families with the longest PPI campaigns. We
annotate each with the type of software, the days the campaign
ran for, the PPI networks involved, and the number of anti-virus
engines that flag the family as unwanted. We abbreviate PPI
networks as [A]monetize, Open[C]andy, [I]nstallMonetizer,
and [O]utbrowse.
grams, yielding a similar distribution pattern to that of
anti-virus, though we cannot rule out direct relationships
with commercial PPI.
4.3 Long Tail of Campaigns
Outside the top 28 longest running PPI campaigns, a
question remains on the mixture of credible and un-
wanted software that makes up the other 845 short lived
campaigns. To explore this, we calculate the fraction
of software families distributed per week by commer-
cial PPI where at least one anti-virus engine in Virus-
Total flags the family as unwanted. Figure 9 presents
our results. On an average week, anti-virus engines label
85% of software families distributed by InstallMonetizer

as unwanted, compared to 68% for Amonetize, 57% for
Outbrowse, and 20% for OpenCandy. These trends hold
true for the entirety of our year-long monitoring. Our
findings illustrate that unwanted software dominates both
long and short-lived campaigns. The only exception is
OpenCandy, which predominantly cultivates advertisers
related to games and anti-virus, and to a lesser extent,
system utilities and some ad injectors. As a consequence
though, OpenCandy has the smallest pool of offers (as
discussed previously in Figure 7), while other PPI net-
works deal with a large number of unwanted software
creators and affiliates.
4.4 Contending with Anti-Virus
As discussed in Section 3, each PPI network provides ad-
vertisers with a capability to pre-check whether an anti-
virus engine is present prior to displaying the advertiser’s
offer. This pre-check consists of a blacklist of registry
keys, file paths, and registry strings specified by the ad-
vertiser. We present a sample in Figure 10. To estimate
the fraction of offers that take advantage of this capabil-
ity, we manually collate a list of 58 common anti-virus
tokens that appear in a random sample of pre-check re-
quirements, as well as the names of anti-virus companies
participating in VirusTotal. We then scanned all offer in-
stallation requirements for these tokens.
Of the unique offers in our dataset, 20% take advan-
tage of PPI downloader capabilities that prevent installs
from occurring on clients running an anti-virus engine.
When anti-virus checks are present, we find advertis-
ers target an average of 3.6 AV families. Our findings
suggest that PPI networks support unwanted software
developers as first-class partners. We caution our met-
ric is a strict underestimate in the event PPI download-

ers scan for side-effects related to anti-virus rather than
the exact brand names. We find the most frequently
targeted brands include ESET, Avast, AVG, McAfee,
Avira, and Symantec. We also observe offers checking
for registry keys related to VirtualBox, VMWare, and
OpenVPN. There are two possible interpretations of this
behavior: advertisers seek to protect themselves from
fraudulent installs on virtualized systems; or advertisers
actively prevent installations on suspected security test-
ing environments. Given the virtualization checks co-
occur with anti-virus evasion, we hypothesize the latter
is more likely. Added to our earlier observation that PPI
downloaders provide a capability to impose a symptom-
free quiet period after installation, a picture emerges of
PPI networks actively supporting unwanted software as
a first-class partner.
4.5 Regional Pricing Per Install
Far and away, installs from the United States fetch the
highest price at roughly $1.50 each. The United King-
dom is the second most lucrative region at roughly $0.80
per install. We find that advertisers pay the highest rates
for installs from North America, Western Europe, and
Japan as shown in Figure 11. Prices outside these re-
gions hover around $0.02–$0.10 per install. This holds
true throughout the entirety of our investigation as shown
in Figure 12 with relatively little volatility in the market.
Despite these lower rates, we show in the next Section
that commercial PPI impacts clients around the globe.

Through Safe Browsing, we estimate the virulent im-
pact that the PPI ecosystem has on end users. Begin-

of Chrome and Firefox against downloading PPI-laden

quest to Google in order to obtain a verdict for whether
the binary is unwanted or malicious. This request con-
tains hosting details about the binary (e.g., URL, IP ad-
dress) and related metadata including a digest of the bi-
nary [27]. In order to map these downloads to digests of
known PPI downloaders, we scan Safe Browsing’s repos-
itory of dynamic execution traces in search of network
requests that match the offer discovery protocol used by
each PPI affiliate network (previously discussed in Sec-
tion 3). From this repository, we identify 1.5 million bi-
naries tied to one of the four PPI networks we study.
We show the total weekly downloads for these 1.5 mil-
lion binaries between June 1, 2015–January 7, 2016 in
Figure 13, irrespective of whether Safe Browsing dis-
played a warning. We caution these estimates of traffic
to PPI networks should serve only as a lower bound as
Safe Browsing’s coverage of all possible binaries is in-
complete. Similarly, due to Safe Browsing displaying
warnings for policy-violating PPI downloaders, opera-
tors have an incentive to quickly cycle binaries and host-
ing pages. Caveats aside, we find publishers for the four
PPI networks drive an average of 3.5 million downloads
per week, though the volume appears to be in decline.
Even as a lower bound, our results illustrate the massive
influence that PPI networks have on unwanted software
distribution.
5.2 PPI Downloader Warnings
In order to obtain a broader perspective of the entire
PPI ecosystem’s impact on end users (not just the four
networks we study), we measure the volume of weekly
warnings generated by Safe Browsing for PPI down-
loaders. Users encounter warnings in one of two ways:
download warnings that trigger for policy-violating PPI
downloaders, and full-page interstitials that appear when
users visit websites commonly distributing PPI-laden
software. Because affiliate publishers attempt to evade
detection (discussed more in Section 6), Safe Browsing
