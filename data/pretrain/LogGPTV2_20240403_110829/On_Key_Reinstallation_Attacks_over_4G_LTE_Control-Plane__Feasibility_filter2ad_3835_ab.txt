### OFDM Subchannels and Interference

Interference in OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing) subchannels can lead to a loss of orthogonality, preventing the network from accurately recovering the original data symbols across spectrally overlapping subchannels. In our Asynchronous Off-Tone Jamming (AOTJ) technique, the jammer is not synchronized with the target signal. It transmits asynchronous off-tones that are not perfectly periodic or have an offset at the sampling frequencies, thereby introducing Inter-Carrier Interference (ICI) at the receiver.

### Evaluation of Attacks

We evaluated the feasibility and practicality of our attacks on real operational LTE networks. For these experiments, we used a Google Pixel 2 as the attacker device and a Google Pixel 1 as the victim device. We conducted tests with two U.S. LTE operators: AT&T (Operator I) and T-Mobile (Operator II). Both the attacker and victim devices were registered with these operators using pre-paid SIM cards. We utilized MobileInsight, an LTE signaling messages analyzer, to capture LTE signaling messages at both the attacker and victim devices. We performed a total of 200 experiments on each network operator to assess the practicality of each attack step.

To evaluate the practicality of the attacks, we employed low-cost commodity SDR (Software-Defined Radio) hardware, specifically the HACKRF One, which costs $299. The HACKRF One can block uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) LTE signaling messages by generating ICI signals within the LTE frequency band. To synchronize the start and stop of jamming with respect to LTE signaling messages, we used QXDM, a real-time LTE signaling message sniffing/capturing tool from Qualcomm.

### Overview of Attacks and Their Root Causes

The attacker can launch two types of key reinstallation attacks by exploiting signaling vulnerabilities. In the first type, the attacker hijacks the location update procedure of the victim device, making it unreachable for incoming voice calls and data packets. In the second type, the attacker deregisters the victim device from the network, causing an LTE service outage. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of these attacks over real LTE carrier networks.

There are two root causes for these attacks:
1. **Vulnerability in the LTE Control-Plane Procedure**: The LTE control-plane procedure is susceptible to key reinstallation attacks when the count reset procedure (i.e., the LTE Security Mode Command procedure) is allowed to re-execute multiple times after the completion of the key installation procedure (i.e., the LTE NAS Authentication procedure).
2. **Partial Acceptance of Failed Integrity Checks**: Certain control-plane messages are partially accepted even if they fail the integrity check. These messages are finally accepted after the network re-authenticates the device, without requesting the device to re-send the failed message.

### Attacking the LTE Control Plane

#### Overview
We demonstrate the feasibility and practicality of key reinstallation attacks in the LTE control plane. The adversary exploits the fact that an inter-system switch from LTE to 3G and back to LTE triggers the location update procedure, which installs the key and resets the count values. The attacker silently initiates an inter-system switch at the victim device through Circuit Switched FallBack (CSFB). After the key installation, the attacker strategically blocks the victim's UL signaling messages, causing the count reset procedure to fail. The network then re-initiates the failed procedure, resetting the count values again. This results in keystream block reuse for subsequent signaling messages. The attacker stops jamming, encrypts a spoofed message using the victim's keystream block, and sends it to the network. According to the 3GPP standard, the network executes the latest received message and discards the earlier one, making the attack realistic.

#### LTE Location Hijacking Attack

**Feasibility Analysis from LTE Standard:**
We exploit two vulnerabilities in attacking LTE confidentiality and integrity protocols:

1. **Separate Procedures for Integrity and Confidentiality**:
   - **Authentication Procedure**: The LTE core network invokes mutual authentication (AKA procedure) with the subscriber device. The core network sends an Authentication Request message, and the device authenticates the network, installs the key, and sends an Authentication Response. The network verifies the response and installs the key.
   - **Security Mode Command (SMC) Procedure**: After authentication, the network sends an SMC message to the device, which includes NAS security algorithms and NAS-MAC. The device resets the count values to zero after verifying the NAS-MAC. The device then generates a NAS Security Mode Complete message, which is both ciphered and integrity-protected. The network verifies the message and resets the counts, completing the NAS security setup.

   **Vulnerability 1**: Failure of the SMC procedure does not renew the security key. The attacker can block the transmission of the NAS Security Mode Complete message, causing the network to re-initiate the SMC procedure and reset the counts again, leading to keystream block reuse.

2. **Conditional Acceptance of Failed Integrity Checks**:
   - **LTE NAS Specification**: Certain NAS messages (e.g., TAU Request, Detach Request/Accept) are conditionally accepted even if they fail the integrity check. The network re-authenticates the device before accepting the message.

   **Vulnerability 2**: The network re-authenticates the device instead of rejecting messages that fail the integrity check.

**Detailed Attack Procedure:**

**Pre-condition**:
Before launching the attack, the attacker needs to know the TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) of the victim. The attacker can obtain the TMSI by calling the victim and capturing the broadcast paging message, which includes the TMSI. The attacker must hang up the call before the victim's phone starts ringing to ensure the TMSI is obtained without alerting the victim.

**Experiment Results**:
We conducted over 200 experiments to assess the practicality of hanging up the call before the victim's phone rings. The average time between the call initialization and the paging message delivery is 3.5 seconds for Operator I and 4.6 seconds for Operator II. The attacker has an error margin of 3.3 seconds and 5.3 seconds, respectively, to hang up the call before the victim's phone rings.

**Triggering Key Update Through Inter-System Switch**:
The attacker dials a call to the victim, forcing a CSFB connection and an inter-system switch from LTE to 3G/2G. After hanging up, the victim device returns to LTE, performs the RACH procedure, and receives a C-RNTI. The attacker sniffs the RACH messages to associate the TMSI with the C-RNTI. The device then sends an unciphered TAU Request message, and the network performs the Authentication procedure, installing the key.

**Experiment Results**:
We conducted over 200 experiments to assess the practicality of triggering the inter-system switch. We found that the success rate depends on whether the victim device and the network support VoLTE. If either does not support VoLTE, the inter-system switch is more likely to occur.
