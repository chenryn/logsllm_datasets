### Title: Pre-built JOP Chains with JOP ROCKET: Bypassing DEP without ROP

**Abstract:**

Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) has become the de facto standard for code-reuse attacks in exploit development. However, another technique, Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP), offers an alternative approach. Unlike ROP, which is supported by a variety of well-established tools such as Mona and ROPgadget, JOP has historically lacked dedicated tools and practical information. This scarcity led to the misconception that JOP had never been used in real-world exploits.

The landscape has now shifted with the introduction of JOP ROCKET, a reverse engineering and exploitation framework developed by Brizendine as part of his doctoral research. The latest version of JOP ROCKET can generate pre-built JOP chains, significantly reducing the effort required to create JOP-based exploits. These pre-built chains, under ideal conditions, require minimal user modification to bypass security measures like Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

**Talk Overview:**

This presentation aims to demystify JOP and bring it into the mainstream of exploit development. We will cover the technical intricacies of JOP, including its similarities and differences from ROP. The talk will focus on providing concrete examples and live demonstrations of JOP exploits, highlighting the nuances and potential pitfalls.

Key points include:

1. **Introduction to JOP**: Understanding the principles and mechanics of Jump-Oriented Programming.
2. **Comparison with ROP**: Exploring the similarities and key differences between JOP and ROP.
3. **JOP ROCKET Framework**: An in-depth look at the features and capabilities of JOP ROCKET, including the generation of pre-built JOP chains.
4. **Practical Examples and Demos**: Step-by-step walkthroughs of creating and deploying JOP exploits, with a focus on bypassing DEP using `VirtualProtect()` or `VirtualAlloc()`.
5. **Challenges and Solutions**: Addressing the complexities and non-obvious issues in JOP exploit development and how JOP ROCKET simplifies the process.

**Conclusion:**

While JOP remains a challenging and less-discussed code-reuse attack, the advent of JOP ROCKET and its pre-built JOP chains makes it more accessible and practical. This talk will equip attendees with the knowledge and tools needed to incorporate JOP into their exploit development toolkit, expanding the range of techniques available to bypass modern security defenses.
