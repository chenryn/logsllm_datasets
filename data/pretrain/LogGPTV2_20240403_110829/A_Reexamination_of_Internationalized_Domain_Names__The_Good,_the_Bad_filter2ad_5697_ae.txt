unresolvable (55%), error (9%), parked (21%) and empty
(2%). The result suggests that most Type-1 IDNs are owned
by opportunistic registrants. Nevertheless, we discovered
2 domains involving malware delivery (xn--bet365-n82p.
com and xn--bet365-g37i416dc3e.com, which impersonate
bet365.com).
C. Summary of Findings
By exploiting the semantics of brand domains, attackers can
create deceptive IDNs for malicious activities like phishing.
Though such attack has never been reported before, our
detector has already identiﬁed 1, 497 IDNs which are likely

involved. While a few of them have been used for malicious
activities, most of them are still in “sleep mode”.
VIII. DISCUSSION
Recommendations. Our work has identiﬁed at least 6, 241
malicious IDNs and some of them are in active use and very
deceptive for users. We believe to solve the issues around IDN
abuse, efforts from all parties in the Internet ecosystem are
required. For registries maintaining DNS zones, checking if a
domain registration request is intended for malign purposes
is necessary. As an example, we found a brand protection
system is deployed on three TLDs (e.g., cn), by performing
resemblance checks on visual appearances, pronunciation and
semantics [11]. For registrars selling domains, domain parking
should be avoided for abusive IDNs, which could curb at-
tackers’ revenues from domain name fraud. For browsers, our
analysis on off-the-shelf browsers shows not all of the browser
vendors correctly implement the guidance from IETF, and we
recommend them to deliver code patches promptly. We also
notice that policies based on the diversity of character sets
are not enough to prevent IDN abuse. IE 11 seems to address
this issue adequately, which prompts an alert when the domain
name contains Unicode characters. For end users, we believe
education is necessary to let them understand the harm and
look carefully for indicators.
IX. RELATED WORK
IDN. Though the IDN implementation has been rolled out
for more than a decade, there are only few studies covering
this scheme and its security implications. In particular, the
homograph attack caused by IDN received most attention from
the security community. The ﬁrst research of this issue was
done by Tobias et al. in 2006, who analyzed a small amount of
users’ network trafﬁc to ﬁnd IDNs impersonating Alexa top
500 sites, and measured their popularity and intention [25].
Hannay et al. showed homograph attack was gaining traction
from the cyber-criminals [20]. Chris et al. looked into different
ways in which IDNs are abused, and found they were utilized
for malware distribution and botnet communications [37].
We revisit this topic but our study is much more com-
prehensive in terms of scale, observations and attack vectors
identiﬁed. By scanning zone ﬁles from major TLDs and
iTLDs, we discovered over 1.4 million IDNs, which are
orders of magnitude more than previous works. We measured
the entire IDN ecosystem, including hosting, registration and
usage. In addition to homograph attack, our study discovered
new semantic attack launched through IDNs.
Domain-squatting. The attacks from IDN aim to confuse web
users when recognizing domain names, in hopes of hijacking
their web trafﬁc, which can be classiﬁed as domain-squatting
attacks. Previous studies have revealed different forms of such
attacks, like typo-squatting [1, 29, 50]. Recent studies even
show that the conﬁguration issues and hardware errors of
users’ machines could be exploited by attackers to harvest
domain requests, which is called bitsquatting [43, 53]. The
semantic attack discovered by our research complements the
existing works in this area and suggests the attack vectors
under this category are not yet exhausted. Regarding the
impact of domain-squatting, most of the reputable domains
are targeted by this attack vector [1] but the overall negative
externalities to the Internet users are still moderate [29].
DNS abuse. DNS has been abused by attackers to cover their
infrastructures from a long time ago. They obtain domain
names from domain registrars and link them to a broad
spectrum of cyber-criminal activities, like blackhat SEO [14],
malware [19] and spam [3, 34]. A great amount of effort
has been devoted by the research community to detecting
such malicious domains, mainly through DNS analysis, URL
analysis and code analysis [4–6, 45, 47, 55]. In parallel, many
studies focus on understanding attackers’ operational models
behind domains [18, 22, 38, 48, 49] and how to protect DNS
against abuse [7, 13].
X. CONCLUSION
To make Internet more accessible to people whose primary
languages are not English, IETF initiated the IDN standard
and many registrars have opened up the registration for IDNs.
Through quantitative analysis, our study shows the volume of
IDNs has been steadily growing over years, and now more
than 1.4 million IDNs are registered. Despite the increase in
volume, their value to Internet users is far under expectation.
Through stratiﬁed sampling analysis, we found only 19.8%
IDNs deliver meaningful content, compared to 33.6% of
ASCII domains. Moreover, visits to them are far less frequent
than non-IDNs under gTLDs like com. What makes IDN
more problematic is that new attack vectors have been enabled
and abused for cyber-attacks like brand phishing. IDN is
known to enable homograph attack and we discovered 1, 516
IDNs resembling known brands. At least 100 of them are
conﬁrmed malicious. Still, attackers have a large candidate
pool of deceptive IDNs, given that 42, 671 IDNs can be used
for homograph attack and most of them are unregistered. What
remains less known is that, IDN can be designed to confuse
users by padding keywords or translating English brand names
(called semantic attack). We discovered 1,497 IDNs under
the ﬁrst case, and some brands (like 58.com) are targeted by
over 100 IDNs. We believe the development of IDN needs
rectiﬁcation and efforts should be spared by all entities in
Internet, including registries, registrars and Internet software.
