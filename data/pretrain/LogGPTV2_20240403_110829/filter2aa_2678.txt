**Ideal Layout of a Generic ICS Network**
- **Typical Layout:**
  - Legacy equipment
  - Unmanaged infrastructure
  - Vendor support
  - Regulatory compliance

**Challenges in ICS Environments**
- **Legacy Equipment:** Outdated systems that are difficult to replace.
- **Ownership Ambiguity:** Unclear responsibility for maintenance and security.
- **Unmanaged Infrastructure:** Lack of proper management and oversight.
- **Time Constraints:** Limited resources for regular maintenance.
- **Vendor Support:** Dependence on external vendors for updates and patches.
- **Regulations:** Compliance with industry standards and regulations.

**Network Security Monitoring (NSM) in ICS**
- **Pre-HAVEX vs. Post-HAVEX:**
  - **Pre-HAVEX:** Focus on basic network monitoring and asset identification.
  - **Post-HAVEX:** Enhanced focus on threat detection and incident response.

**Key Components of NSM and Asset Identification**
- **Understanding Network Topologies:**
  - Knowing the layout and connections within the network.
- **Monitoring for Changes:**
  - Detecting and responding to any unauthorized or unexpected changes.
- **Building on Basics:**
  - Establishing a solid foundation for more advanced security measures.

**Challenges in Implementing NSM**
- **Not a Panacea:**
  - NSM is not a one-size-fits-all solution.
- **Resource Intensive:**
  - Requires dedicated personnel and processes.
- **Buy-In and Preparation:**
  - The most challenging part is gaining organizational buy-in and preparing for implementation.

**Value of NSM in ICS**
- **Threat Identification:**
  - Detecting potential security threats.
- **Device Health Monitoring:**
  - Identifying misconfigured or failing devices.
- **Situational Awareness:**
  - Providing a better understanding of the overall network environment.
- **Integrated Defense Strategy:**
  - Fitting into a larger, comprehensive defense strategy.

**Why NSM Excels in ICS**
- **Static Environments:**
  - ICS environments are relatively static, making it easier to detect anomalies.
- **Fewer Users:**
  - Compared to enterprise networks, ICS networks have fewer users.
- **Limited Assets:**
  - Fewer assets to monitor compared to IT networks.
- **No Patches? At Least Monitor:**
  - Even if patching is not feasible, continuous monitoring can help identify issues.

**Safely Capturing Data**
- **Logging and Centralization:**
  - Enable logging and centralize log data for analysis.
- **Key Data Sources:**
  - Network and memory data are crucial.
- **Testing and Implementation:**
  - Use test/lab environments first.
  - Install taps/hubs that fail open.
  - Schedule installations during planned downtime.
- **Vendor Collaboration:**
  - Work with vendors to ensure managed network infrastructure.
- **Bandwidth Considerations:**
  - Be mindful of network bandwidth usage.
- **Manual Sampling:**
  - Use mirrored ports, hubs, and taps for manual sampling.

**Easy-to-Use Starter Kit**
- **Fundamentals:**
  - Basic but effective tools.
  - Adversaries are efficient, so noise reduction is critical.
- **Tools:**
  - **SecurityOnion:** Comprehensive security platform.
  - **Tcpdump:** For packet capture.
  - **Flowbat/SiLK:** For flow analysis.
  - **Xplico:** For FTP traffic analysis.
  - **NetworkMiner/Foremost:** For extracting files like executables and project files.
  - **Wireshark:** For detailed packet analysis, including endpoints, I/O data, and unusual function codes.

**Key Focus Areas**
- **Top Talkers:**
  - Identify the most active devices.
- **Bandwidth Usage:**
  - Determine the biggest bandwidth consumers.
- **Encrypted Communications:**
  - Detect and analyze encrypted traffic.
- **Critical Assets:**
  - Identify and monitor critical assets and normalized traffic.
- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - Firmware updates outside scheduled downtimes.
  - Unusual communication patterns, such as HMIs talking to each other.
  - Spikes in protocol historical data.
  - New or suspicious connections in the ICS, e.g., PLCs communicating with unknown domains.

**IT and OT Integration**
- **Collaboration:**
  - Integration between IT and OT is inevitable.
  - Work together and develop a comprehensive plan.
- **Defender Narratives:**
  - Many strategies exist for defending ICS environments.
- **Vendor Involvement:**
  - Force discussions with vendors.
  - Include security requirements in contracts.
  - Clarify ownership and responsibilities.

**Conclusion**
- **Reflection:**
  - Ancient Rome left us roads and concrete.
  - Han Dynasty China gave us paper and printing.
  - Edwardian Britain gave us steam engines.
  - America gave us the internet.
  - What will we leave behind?
- **Legacy:**
  - Legacy used to mean a gift for the next generation.
  - Now, it often means old and insecure.
  - Let's reclaim the word "legacy" and be ashamed to die until we provide secure industrial infrastructure to the next generation.
