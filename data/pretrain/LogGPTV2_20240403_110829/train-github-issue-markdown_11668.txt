In order to support understanding (rare, but possible) SEGFAULT, OOM, etc, in
AOT Dart code we will likely to want to support symbol generation for
gen_snapshot, etc.
I don't know what the contract is for AOT dart code (is it supposed to be able
to crash this way?) but it seems like this may be useful?
@a-siva may already have a bug on file for this, but I didn't find it in a
quick search so here is one.
