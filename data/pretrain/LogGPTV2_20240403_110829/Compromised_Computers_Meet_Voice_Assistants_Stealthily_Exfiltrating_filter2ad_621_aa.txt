Abstract—New security concerns arise due to the growing
popularity of voice assistants (VA)
in home and enterprise
networks. We explore how malware infected computers can
encode sensitive data into audio and leverage nearby VAs to
exﬁltrate it. Such low cost attacks can be launched remotely,
at scale, and can bypass network defenses. By using Dual-
Tone Multi-Frequency tones to encode data into audio that is
played over ordinary computer speakers, modest amounts of data
(e.g., a kilobyte) can be transmitted with a phone call lasting a
few minutes. This can be done while making the audio nearly
inaudible for most people. With the help of a prototype built by
us, we experimentally assess the impact of several factors that
impact data transfer rates and transmission accuracy achieved
by such attacks. Our results show that voice assistants in the
vicinity of computers can pose new threats to data stored on
them.
I. INTRODUCTION
Voice offers a natural way for people to interact with devices
in their environment which has led to an ever increasing
number of computing devices with embedded microphones
and speakers. At the same time, voice assistants (VAs), which
facilitate such voice interactions, have become commonplace.
For example, according to a report in early 2019, more than
100 million Amazon Alexa or Alexa enabled devices were
sold [25]. Although Amazon Echo and other similar devices
(e.g., Google Home) are commonly deployed in the home
environment, increasingly they are also being used in business
settings. Amazon Alexa Business has advocated the use of VAs
for employee work areas and conference rooms.
Although VAs enable more natural interactions, their con-
nectivity to the network opens them to a variety of new
potential attacks. In recent research [5], [10], [16], [18], [34],
[35], [41], a number of attacks on VAs have been investigated
(see Section II). These attacks primarily focus on issuing
malicious commands to VAs and provide important insights
into how such devices can be exploited by attackers. But
they do not address two important questions. First, can such
attacks be carried out by a remote actor at scale with low cost?
Second, when a computer is in close proximity of a VA, can
the VA be used to exﬁltrate sensitive data from this computer?
We investigate attacks that use VAs to bypass network defenses
which are deployed against data leakage.
As a concrete example in the home setting, consider a laptop
or a home ofﬁce desktop that is close to a VA. Such computers
can be infected with malware with a variety of attack vectors
including drive-by-downloads, social engineering and others.
Once infected, the malware can locate sensitive data such
as passwords and try to exﬁltrate it. Such exﬁltration will
not be possible in well secured environments that use host
and network defenses against data leakage. However, another
possibility for the malware is to encode the data into an audio
ﬁle. The infected computer can issue a command to a VA
to make a phone call and then play the encoded audio with
its speaker. The called phone number can be controlled by
the attacker and data can be decoded from received audio.
Thus, in this case, data can be exﬁltrated from a compromised
computer even in the presence of effective network defenses.
Since malware infections can target a large number of users at
very low cost, such attacks can be crafted at scale and remotely
without being in close proximity of VAs. Unlike past work, we
do not require that the attacker be in the same physical location
as the targeted VA. Also, we utilize the phone channel for data
exﬁltration after the VA is commanded to make a phone call.
Although past work has explored audio networking and au-
dio covert channels extensively [9], [15], [16], [19], [21], [22],
[26] where data is transmitted in audio form between devices
via speakers and microphones, we investigate the efﬁcacy of
such data transfer over a phone channel that is set up via a
VA. Also, similar to hidden commands, we need to make data
transmission unnoticeable when a user may be in the same
area as the infected computer or the VA. The challenge thus
is to transmit data via audio that is unlikely to be noticed
by a human while ensuring accuracy and high transmission
rate. Past work has shown how modulation with an ultrasonic
carrier can be used to meet this goal [41] but this requires high
quality speakers that are not available on computers commonly
used in the home and ofﬁce environments. We demonstrate that
it is possible to use speakers that come with home and ofﬁce
computers when modulation is done with a carrier frequency
close to the higher end of human hearing range which provides
a tradeoff between inaudibility and transmission bandwidth.
We explore a concrete setting to quantify the accuracy and
bandwidth of data transmission from an infected computer
to a remote attacker controlled computer via the Alexa voice
assistant.
Since malware and targeting of computers by it has been
investigated extensively, in this paper we focus on the ex-
ploitation of VAs by such malware for data exﬁltration. More
speciﬁcally, we explore if a VA can be commanded to make a

II. RELATED WORK
Security and privacy issues related to VAs have been ex-
plored by many researchers in the recent past. These efforts
have focused on how unauthorized and potentially malicious
commands can be used to target such devices [1], [5], [6],
[10], [18], [20], [30], [35], [40]. Diao et al. [10] demonstrated
that an attacker could inject synthetic audio or play commands
to control a smartphone. However, the commands could be
noticed by people close to VAs. Carlini et al. [5] ﬁrst demon-
strated that such commands could be made unnoticeable or
hidden to humans while VAs would respond to them in the
expected manner. This work expanded the threat model to in-
clude humans being in the vicinity of the VAs that were targets
of such malicious commands. The use of ultrasonic sound
carriers is another technique that has been proposed to hide
commands from being heard by humans [3], [9], [16], [17],
[34], [38], [39], [41], [42]. Zhang et al. [41] modulated voice
commands on ultrasonic carriers (i.e., frequency ≥ 20 kHz) to
achieve inaudibility. The nonlinearity of the microphone acts
as the demodulator of the sound and allows the commands
carried on the ultrasonic sound to be decoded and executed.
While Zhang et al. demonstrated this attack when the speaker
is within 10–20 inch range of the device’s microphone, Roy
et al. [34] extended the attack range of this ultrasonic sound
to 25 ft. with a speaker array. Zhou et al. [42] successfully
demonstrated how an autonomous car can be controlled with
hidden commands. Yan et al. [39] demonstrated how a wave
generated by an ultrasonic transducer can propagate in a solid
material (e.g. a table.) to reach the VA.
Past VA attacks which rely on ultrasonic sounds, all require
in close
speakers of high quality or additional equipment
proximity of the target. In our work, we do not use ultrasonic
sound modulation because it cannot be effectively transmitted
via speakers that are commonly available in computers. We
use sounds in the 15 kHz to 20 kHz frequency range, which
are within the designed frequency range of these common
speakers. We also require that the modulated sound can be
transmitted over an arbitrary distance to an endpoint controlled
by an attacker. We utilize a VA to achieve this as it sends the
audio over a telephony channel. Also, previous work is only
focused on issuing malicious commands to VAs, not on using
them for data exﬁltration over long distances.
Malicious commands directed at VAs can also be hidden
in other sounds that may not raise an alarm when heard by
humans. Sch¨onherr et al. [35] proposed a method to hide
malicious command in different sounds like songs and sounds
of chirping birds to take control of VAs. Carlini et al. used
audio adversarial examples to compromise voice recognition
systems in [6]. Such work primarily relied on generating audio
ﬁles which are then fed directly to a voice transcription system,
not transmitting the audio through air to a VA. Abdullah
et al. [1] and Yuan et al. [40] presented more practical
adversarial attack techniques that could be used in a more
realistic setting. These works do demonstrate the feasibility of
hidden commands against VAs but they do not investigate how

phone call and if sound, which is inaudible to most people, can
be used to encode and send data over such a call. Since the call
may go over a telephony network, only the voiceband (300–
3400 Hz) could be used for such data transfer. This motivated
our use of Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) [2] encoding
of data. Since we modulate the audio with a carrier frequency
that is outside of the voiceband, the telephony channel will
act as a low pass ﬁlter and drop frequencies higher than 3400
Hz. However, because of VA microphone nonlinearity, we ﬁnd
that encoding DTMF frequencies are reintroduced in the audio
sent by the VA over the telephony channel. We demonstrate
that presence of such frequencies is sufﬁcient to decode the
data in the received audio while maintaining the stealthiness
of the audio transmission between the computer speaker and
the voice assistant microphone. By developing a system and
experimentally evaluating it, we are able to show that VAs
do create a new vulnerability for data theft which could be a
serious concern in enterprise environments. More speciﬁcally,
we make the following contributions in this paper.
• We demonstrate the feasibility of data exﬁltration from
infected computers that are in close vicinity of a VA. Such
attacks can be carried out at scale by a remote malicious
actor who is able to commandeer a large number of
computers that are in the vicinity of VAs. Thus, unlike
much of the past work, we show this can be done without
the attacker being in the same physical location as the VA.
• We show that by carefully choosing DTMF and carrier
frequencies, we can make the sound that transmits the
data inaudible to most people while leveraging voice
assistant microphone and phone channel characteristics
to naturally recover the encoding frequencies and decode
the sent data.
• We experimentally estimate the bandwidth of the channel
that is set up to exﬁltrate data. We show that a kilobyte
of data can be transmitted with high accuracy by a call
lasting less than 5 minutes in a realistic setting where the
VA may be several feet away from the computer.
• We explore the impact key parameters such as stealthiness
and distance between VAs and infected machines have on
the bandwidth of such exﬁltration channels.

Covert or side channels based on audio signals have been
explored extensively in the past. Guri et al. [15] utilized the
noise emitted from the CPU and chassis fans to transmit data
bits from computers. Hanspatch et al. [16] presented a covert
acoustical mesh network with ultrasonic sounds. Deshotels
[9] expanded this method to mobile devices. All of these
