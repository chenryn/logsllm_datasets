necessary component, as A provides the ﬂexibility
to accommodate both large and small-scale elections.
4. Vulnerabilities and future directions
A, as an Internet-based voting system, is suscep-
tible to a number of vulnerabilities and attacks. We will
consider these vulnerabilities along with possible solu-
tions which will be implemented in future versions of
the A system.
Distributed key generation. Currently, the distributed
key generation subsystem of A is not universally
veriﬁable, i.e., some authorities may misbehave without
being detected. This may result in a bias in the random-
ness of the elections’ public keys. There are standard
cryptographic solutions to this problem which will be
incorporated into future versions.
Transcript availability and robustness. The A
system relies on an SQL database for the preservation
of the election trail which includes all encrypted ballots
and public keys of authorities, as well as other auxiliary
values. While this database contains no secrets, (due
to our transparency design principle) and thus we need
not provide any access control for read access, it is sup-
posed to be available for the veriﬁcation of the election,
as well as the publication of the election results. An in-
sider attack that deletes the database in some stage of
A’s operation would naturally be destructive to an
election process. To tackle this problem, the database
can be replicated and stored at frequent intervals in re-
mote replication database servers. Future versions of
A will incorporate such fault-tolerance techniques.
Vote buying and coercion. In the current implementa-
tion, a malicious voting client may produce a proof of
how a user voted or otherwise leak information about
the voter. Future versions of A will incorporate
the use of ciphertext re-randomization, a technique that
has been suggested as a way to obtain protection against
such proof-of-vote attacks in the context of e-voting (cf.
[10]).
Voter veriﬁability. Currently, our system does not oﬀer
to a voter a method for physically verifying that his pub-
lished encrypted ballot encrypts his actual choice. In-
stead, the voter relies on the correctness of the client
software for this task. We note that dealing with this is a
complex problem, since any method for voter-based ver-
iﬁability can also potentially used by the voter to prove
how he voted and thus allow for vote buying.
Viruses and other client-environment hazards. Al-
though cryptography cannot entirely solve the secure
platform problem for remote Internet voting [34], an ob-
vious area where it would help is by employing a trusted
computing environment [35]. It is typical for many cryp-
tographic protocols to assume an ideal environment that
is free of viruses and other malicious software, and fre-
quently many assumptions are unspeciﬁed [26]. In other
cases, where operating details are speciﬁed, they are of-
ten too optimistic or ignore issues such as security and
usability trade-oﬀs.
If A is run on a standard PC, the client envi-
ronment can be subverted by viruses and other mali-
cious code which may reside on it and have taken con-
trol of the local machine. Such attacks are particularly
devastating for any e-voting scheme employing a non-
dedicated PC environment. A standard approach to deal
with such attacks is to provide a stripped down operat-
ing environment containing an authorized Web browser
with the A applet installed which can be down-
loaded and burned into a bootable CD-ROM. With such
a CD, the user can boot into a clean environment. Us-
ing a stripped-down version of a free and open source
operating as a base would allow complete auditing of
the software down to the compiler and operating system
level, which is important as the electronic voting system

ture version of A, we will consider the development
of such a stripped down operating environment.
Denial-of-service attacks. The A system, as all
Internet-based voting systems, is susceptible to denial-
of-service attacks. While such attacks can be partic-
ularly devastating against a voting system, there exist
countermeasures which we will consider incorporating
into future versions of A (a possible approach to
consider is [39]).
User interaction. Computer systems running election
protocols may in one way or another engage their hu-
man operators to become active participants in secu-
rity/integrity veriﬁcation (cf. [14]) and the system’s se-
curity guarantees may rely partly on users’ reporting cer-
tain types of abnormal operation. Enabling human veri-
ﬁability of secure system operation is an important goal
for any secure system implementation. We view A
as an important step forward in understanding the issues
between cryptography and its users.
