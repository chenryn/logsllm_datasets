Suspicious MOAS con(cid:3)icts and type-2 attacks: Since
we use similar probing techniques to identify suspicious
MOAS con(cid:3)icts (type-1 attacks) and type-2 attacks, we
present them together here. We group the observed sus-
picious (cid:2)ngerprinting results into the following categories.
† Different liveness: If the host appears alive from one
location, but unresponsive somewhere else, it may be
a real hijacking attack barring intermediate network
problems and special (cid:2)rewall policies (Figure 5(a)).
† Different Operating Systems: Figure 5(b) is a suspi-
cious type-2 attack with different Nmap-inferred OS.
† Different open ports: Figure 5(b) exhibits inconsis-
tency in open services: BGP (port 179).
† Different TCP timestamps (uptime): The host
probed from one location may support TCP times-
tamp, but not from another location, e.g., Figure 5(b).
We also observed signi(cid:2)cantly different uptime values
(Figure 7(a)).
† Different ICMP timestamps (local time):
Fig-
ure 6(a) indicates signi(cid:2)cantly different ICMP times-
tamp values.
† Different IP IDs: For systems with globally incre-
menting IP-ID patterns, there is a signi(cid:2)cant difference
in IP ID return values or patterns, e.g., Figure 6(a).
Suspicious subMOAS con(cid:3)icts and type-4 attacks: For
suspected subMOAS (type-3) and type-4 attacks, we use
re(cid:3)ect-scan to identify hijacking incidents. The following
is a found example of a suspicious subMOAS con(cid:3)ict with
the probing results using re(cid:3)ect-scan shown in Figure 6(b).
Pre(cid:2)x 193.140.140.0/24 is announced by AS15390 at 21:27
on April 25th, 2006, which has a subMOAS con(cid:3)ict with
pre(cid:2)x 193.140.0.0/16 owned by AS8517.
1. 193.140.140.8 (H2) in the subnet 193.140.140.0/24 is
selected as the idle host, because its IP ID increases
regularly by one and has the open port 21.
2. We send SYN/ACK packets to port 21 of H2 to verify
that H2 responds with RST.
3. The live host 193.140.0.2 (H1) in the larger pre(cid:2)x
193.140.0.0/16 but not in the subnet is chosen as the
re(cid:3)ect host with an open port 514.

scan example (type-3).
4. Compare the idle host H2’s IP ID values before and
after sending spoofed packets to re(cid:3)ect host H1 with
source IP of H2. We found the idle host did not re-
ceive 30 re(cid:3)ected packets, which may be dropped or
delivered somewhere in AS8517 (Figure 6(b)(1)).
5. To verify that the test did not fail due to ingress
(cid:2)ltering3 which may cause the idle host not to re-
ceive spoofed packets, we select another idle host
3If AS8517 has ingress (cid:2)ltering that (cid:2)lters out incoming traf(cid:2)c with
193.140.0.22 similar to H1 to be the verify host.
6. We do the similar test to check for ingress (cid:2)ltering. By
comparing the IP ID value of the verify host before and
after sending spoofed packets using verify host as the
source IP to the re(cid:3)ect host, we (cid:2)nd that it receives all
re(cid:3)ected packets indicating the lack of ingress (cid:2)ltering
in AS8517 (Figure 6(b)(2)).
source IP from inside the AS, the spoofed packet cannot reach the re(cid:3)ect
host, and no re(cid:3)ect packets will be generated.
Since we are con(cid:2)dent that re(cid:3)ected packets are sent
to the idle host (step 6) and the idle host responds to
SYN/ACK packets (step 2), the idle host’s IP ID value
should be increased, if it received them. Thus, we can con-
clude that this case fails re(cid:3)ect-scan and is highly suspicious
as a real hijacking attack.
6.2. Validation using IP anycast
For load balancing and robustness considerations, a
number of root name-servers are deployed using IP any-
cast [22]. IP anycast, de(cid:2)ned in RFC 1546 [38], is an in-
ternetwork service where multiple severs support the same
service under the same IP address. Currently, 5 out of all
13 DNS root servers (C, F, I, J and K) are using IP anycast,
each with multiple servers in different locations [30, 3]. IP
anycast for root DNS is achieved by announcing the same
pre(cid:2)x and AS number from multiple locations on the Inter-
net, identical to hijacking both the pre(cid:2)x and its AS (type-2
attack). However, this is a valid case; thus, we use it for
validation.
Across two weeks’ monitoring, our system successfully
captured suspicious updates from four root servers (F, I,
J and K), with the exception of the C-root server (c.root-
server.net in pre(cid:2)x 192.33.4.0/24 with origin AS2149). Af-
ter investigating the updates for the C-root server, we (cid:2)nd
that it only have one upstream provider AS174 which is a
large tier-1 ISP. Since AS174 also has a location near to
AS2149, the updates for C-root server do not violate the ge-
ographical constraint and therefore cannot be captured us-
ing that constraint alone. Figure 7 illustrates an example
of the F-root server (f.root-servers.net) detected by our sys-
tem. The IP address of the F-root server is 192.5.5.241 in
pre(cid:2)x 192.5.5.0/24 announced by AS3557. Figure 7 clearly
shows that probing from two different Planetlab nodes ac-
tually reaches two distinct machines, validating our (cid:2)nger-
printing approach.
