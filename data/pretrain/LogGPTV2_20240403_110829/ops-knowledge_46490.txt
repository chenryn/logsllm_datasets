User: I am running a Python script as a Windows service, but it seems to be failing whenever I set it to auto-start. I believe this may be because the service uses network resources that are not yet mounted when the service starts. Is there a way I can get it to wait until startup is complete before running?
Assistant: Add in script wait for the resources who script must use is in good standing, or rewrite script to better design like not exit if dont have connection; wait 1s and try again if connection failed.
