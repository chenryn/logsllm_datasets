Table 3. Classroom-based educator survey analysis results. 
300  copies  have  been  distributed  at  a  variety  of  NSF-sponsored 
job fairs, competitions, and similar events.  
We  were  invited  to  present  a  talk  on  the  game  at  a  large  web 
company’s  internal  security  training  conference,  and  an  optional 
play session was held at the conclusion of the hands-on training. 
5.  EVALUATION METHOD 
In this paper we present evaluations of Control-Alt-Hack via two 
methods:  
Primary:  Feedback  surveys  from  educators  who  requested 
copies of the game; and  
Secondary: User studies performed with the game. 
Both  methods  were  approved  by  the  University  of  Washington’s 
Human Subjects Institutional Review Board. 
5.1  Educator Feedback Surveys 
We  distributed  online  feedback  surveys  via  email  to  the  150 
instructors  who  received  educator  copies  prior  to  May  2013. 
Section  A.2  in  the  Appendix  shows  the  questions  asked  on  the 
educator survey. 22 educators submitted responses to the surveys.

categories  that  emerged  from  the  data.  The  researchers  then

used  the  survey  in  its  entirety  as  the  unit  of  analysis,  rather  than 
individual  responses;  that  is  to  say,  if  part  of  an  educator’s 
response received the code “Awareness,” it did not  matter which 
question  on  the  survey  elicited  the  relevant  response,  and  it  did 
not  matter  how  many

times 
The  primary  coder  and  the  secondary  coder  had  93%  agreement 
across  all  educator  surveys  (N=22)  and  codes  (N=7);  there  were 
11 cases where the primary and the reliability coder disagreed. All 
cases  are  provided  in  the  Appendix  (Section  A.3),  along  with 
contextual  quotes.  Except  for  one  case  in  which  the  reliability 
coder  misread  the  data  and  coded  an  error,  the  primary  coder’s 
results—the  results  reported  in  the  paper—always  represent  the 
stricter of the two viewpoints. That is, we report the upper bound 
on  our  interpretation  of  the  critiques  to  the  game  and  the  lower 
bound on the game’s role in engagement and awareness. 
The primary and secondary coders independently labeled educator 
activities  as  classroom-based  or  non-classroom-based  activities; 
they  had  100%  agreement.  Tables  1  and  2  list  information  about 
classroom- and non-classroom-based activities, respectively.  
5.2  User Studies 
We  posted  recruitment  ads  inviting  participants  to  join  us  for  a 
games  study  session  on:  an  institution-wide  electronic  bulletin 
board; and in the local Craigslist gigs listings. We held two game 
study  sessions:  one  with  7  people  (M=3,  F=4)  divided  into  two 
gameplay  groups;  and  one  with  4  people  in  one  gameplay  group 
(M=1, F=3). The participants covered a range of ages (mean=31, 
min=18,  max=50,  median=29).  5  of  the  participants  could  be 
categorized  as  “hobbyist”  gamers,  and  6  had  casual  or  little 
gaming  experience.  Each  session  lasted  approximately  2  hours. 
Participants  were  compensated  $20  for  their  time.  Following 
consent  paperwork,  participants  filled  out  a  short  pre-gameplay 
survey.  After  this  participants  were  shown  a  15-minute  video 
introducing  them  to  gameplay;  we  used  a  video  for  consistency 
between  sessions.  Participants  played  for  40-60  minutes,  then 
filled out a short post-gameplay questionnaire. 
Coding.  Two  researchers  independently  analyzed  the  survey 
responses  for  themes  and  categories.  (Complying  with  our 
institution’s conflict management plan, one of the researchers has 
no  financial  interest  in  RGB  Hats,  LLC.)  The  researchers 
discussed  and  came  to  a  consensus  regarding  the  data  of  interest 
920in the survey responses. The data in question is presented as direct 
quotations,  and  the  goal  mappings  were  decided  via  consensus 
coding.  
leave the game in the student lounge so they could continue

our weekly majors night at the pub.” 
6.  EDUCATOR SURVEY RESULTS 
The 22 educators who responded to the survey used the game with 
over 450 students at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate 
levels  in  computer  science,  computer  security,  and  game  design 
courses.  These  courses  were  primarily,  although  not  exclusively, 
based  in  the  United  States.  The  educator  survey  results  are  the 
primary evaluation of Control-Alt-Hack in this study. 
As  previously  mentioned,  the  educator  survey responses  fell  into 
one  of  two  categories:  feedback  about  an  activity  using  Control-
Alt-Hack  that  took  place  in  a  classroom,  or  feedback  about  an 
activity  using  Control-Alt-Hack  that  took  place  outside  of  a 
classroom.  Many  of  the  reported  non-classroom  activities  were 
from educators who were vetting the game for classroom use, and 
subsequently  decided  not  to  use  the  game;  the  other  non-
classroom activities were an ACM gathering, a lunch activity, and 
offering the game to students to check out and take home. Table 1 
provides  additional  information  on  the  classroom  activities 
(N=14), and  Table  2 provides additional information  on the  non-
classroom activities (N=8).  
6.1  Positive Functions 
Appreciation of the game expressed in educator surveys generally 
described the game as fulfilling one of two functions: being fun or 
serving  a  social  function  (Social/Engagement);  or  increasing 
students’  awareness  of  computer  security  or  computer  science 
issues (Awareness). 
Social/Engagement  (Classroom:  11/14;  Non-Classroom:  2/8). 
“Social/Engagement” was marked when the educator was deemed 
to be indicating that usage of the game was fun, engaging, and/or 
contributed  to  serve  a  social  function,  such  as  an  icebreaker  or  a 
breather before a test. The following quotes are two examples: 
  E7-classroom  (56  undergraduates,  Cyber-Security  and 
Information Awareness): “It worked as a way to break the 
ice  and  get  students  from  diverse  majors  get  to  know  [sic] 
each other and get thinking about the topics of the course.” 
  E19-classroom 
(27  undergraduates,  Computer  and 
Network Security): “I just wanted to reiterate how great my 
students  thought  the  game  was!  The  students  begged  me  to 
(Classroom: 
11/14;  Non-Classroom: 
1/8). 
Awareness 
“Awareness”  was  marked  when  the  educator  was  deemed  to  be 
indicating  that  usage  of  the  game  served  to  increase  students’ 
awareness  of  security  in  some  fashion,  such  as:  increasing 
exposure  to  domain  terminology;  raising  awareness  of  career 
opportunities;  stimulating  discussion;  or  stimulating  critical 
thinking. The following quotes are two examples: 
  E9-classroom  (60  high  school  students,  Computers  and 
Information  Technology):  “The  game  did  not  necessarily 
teach  security  methods,  but  it  did  a  great  job  of  teaching 
vocabulary  and  literacy.”…“It  increased  awareness  of  my 
program,  and  it  got  more  students  interested  in  computer 
science.” 
  E19-classroom 
(27  undergraduates,  Computer  and 
Network Security): “They really got into it and there was a 
lot of strategizing”…“They were mainly focused on causing 
pain to their classmates, but as I wandered around the room 
I  heard  some  great  discussions  about  the  tradeoffs  of 
choosing  various  hackers’  skill  sets,  what  various  missions 
meant, etc.” 
Table 3 shows the Positive Functions results from the classroom-
based educator responses, and Table 4 shows the results from the 
non-classroom-based educator responses.  
Overall,  in  the  classroom  contexts,  11  of  the  14  educators 
indicated  that  the  game  served  a  Social/Engagement  role,  and  a 
different  set  of  11  educators  indicated  that  the  game  served  to 
increase  Awareness.  For  the  educators  who  did  not  provide 
responses that indicated that the game raised awareness, two were 
courses  about  computer  security;  these  educators  also  indicated 
that  the  game  did  not  have  enough  educational  content  (Section 
6.2).  This  suggests  that  although  our  design  goals  were  aligned 
with  the  intentions  of  educators  not  already  teaching  a  computer 
security  course,  the  goals  were  not  well  aligned  with  some 
educators’  intentions  in  using  the  game  in  security-focused 
courses. 
In  the  non-classroom  contexts,  2  of  the  educators’  responses 
indicated  that  the  game  filled  a  Social/Engagement  role  (E2-
ACM,  E15-vetting),  and  1  of  the  educators  indicated  that  the

educators  reporting  positive  game  functions  in  non-classroom 
activities could be a result of the fact that many of the responses 
in the non-classroom context were from educators who played the 
game (or not, in 2 cases) out of the classroom in order to vet it for 
its suitability for use in the classroom. In many of those cases, the 
educator  decided  not  to  use  Control-Alt-Hack  in  the  classroom 
(Section 6.3  and Table  5), so it is not  surprising that they do not 
comment that the game serves positive functions. 
6.1.1  Discussion 
Overall,  we  find  that  the  feedback  on  the  game—in  the 
classrooms  in  which  it  was  used—shows  promising  indications 
that it performs multiple positive functions. 
Awareness.  In  most  of  the  surveys,  educators’  comments 
indicated that the game helped raise students’ awareness of issues 
related  to  computer  security.  Raising  individuals’  awareness  of 
the  risks,  challenges,  technologies,  and  professions  involved  in 
computer security was a large part of our purpose in creating the 
game (Goals, Section 2.1). 
Social/Engagement.  Again  in  most  of  the  surveys,  educators’ 
comments  indicated  that  the  game  served  a  Social/Engagement 
role in the classroom. This is promising for two reasons: first, it is 
somewhat  correlated  with  “fun,”  which  can  increase  engagement 
or encourage people outside of the classroom to pick up the game. 
Second, some of the educators used the game specifically because 
they had need of a non-traditional educational activity; Section 6.4 
explores the cases where the educators used the game, but would 
not  have  otherwise  covered  comparable  security  material.  The 
apparent  success  of  the  game’s  Social/Engagement  function,  as
