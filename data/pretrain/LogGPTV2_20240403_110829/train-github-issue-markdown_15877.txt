question:  
Excuse me, can it be achieved? All tables can be realized as broadcastTables
by setting a special symbol or other flag bit, because my requirement is that
all tables are broadcast tables, and there are almost hundreds of tables.
after all settings are set, if additions and deletions are made later, it will
cause a lot of work, and I look forward to answering.
