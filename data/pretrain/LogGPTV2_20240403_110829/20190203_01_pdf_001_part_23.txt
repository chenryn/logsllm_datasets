Advanced Server) from the Postgres application menu. This will put the modified
pg_hba.conf file into effect.
6.2 Creating a Publication
Creating a publication requires the following steps:
 Registering the publication server
 Adding the master definition node
 Creating a publication by choosing the tables for the publication along with the
conflict resolution options
 Defining table filters to be enabled on any master nodes
6.2.1 Registering a Publication Server
Registering a publication server is done in a manner identical to single-master replication.
See Section 5.2.1 for directions on registering a publication server.
Figure 6-1 - Replication tree after registering a publication server
After you have successfully registered a publication server, the replication tree of the
xDB Replication Console displays a Publication Server node under which are the SMR
and MMR type nodes.
Continue to build the multi-master replication system under the MMR type node.

6.2.2 Adding the Master Definition Node
The first database to be identified to xDB Replication Server is the master definition
node. This is done by creating a publication database definition subordinate to the MMR
type node under the Publication Server node.
After the publication database definition is created, a Publication Database node
representing the master definition node appears in the replication tree of the xDB
Replication Console. A publication containing tables residing within this database can
then be created under the Publication Database node.
You must enter database connection information such as the database server network
address, database identifier, and database login user name and password when you create
the publication database definition. The connection information is used by the publication
server to access the publication tables when it performs replication.
Step 1: Make sure the database server for the master definition node is running and
accepting client connections.
Step 2: Select the MMR type node under the Publication Server node. From the
Publication menu, choose Publication Database, and then choose Add Database.
Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the MMR type node and choose Add
Database. The Publication Service – Add Database dialog box appears.
Step 3: Fill in the following fields:
 Database Type. Select PostgreSQL or Postgres Plus Advanced Server for the
master definition node. For an Advanced Server Oracle compatible installation,
select the Postgres Plus Advanced Server option. For PostgreSQL or an Advanced
Server PostgreSQL compatible installation, select the PostgreSQL option.
 Host. IP address of the host on which the master definition node is running.
 Port. Port on which the master definition node is listening for connections.
 User. The database user name for the master definition node created in Step 1 of
Section 6.1.3.
 Password. Password of the database user.
 Database. Enter the database name of the master definition node.
 URL Options (For SSL connectivity). Enter the URL options to establish SSL
connectivity to the master definition node. See Section 7.11 for information on
using SSL connections.
 Changeset Logging (For Postgres). Select Table Triggers to use the trigger-
based method of synchronization replication. Select WAL Stream to use the log-
based method of synchronization replication. See Section 2.2.9 for information on
the trigger-based method. See Section 2.2.10 for information on the log-based
method.
 Node Priority Level. An integer from 1 to 10, which is the priority level assigned
to this master node for conflict resolution based on node priority. The highest

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
priority is 1 while the lowest is 10. See Section 6.6.4 for information on conflict
resolution strategies. The default is 1 for the master definition node.

If an error message appears investigate the cause of the error, correct the problem, and
repeat steps 1 through 4.
When the publication database definition is successfully saved, a Publication Database
node is added to the replication tree under the MMR type node of the Publication Server
node.

Figure 6-4 - Replication tree after adding the master definition node
The label MDN appears at the end of the node in the replication tree and in addition, the
MDN field is set to Yes in the Property window to indicate this is the master definition
node.
6.2.3 Adding a Publication
Subordinate to the master definition node, you create a publication that contains tables of
the database.
Step 1: Select the Publication Database node. From the Publication menu, choose Create
Publication. Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the Publication Database
node and choose Create Publication. The Create Publication dialog box appears.
Step 2: Fill in the following fields under the Create Publication tab:
 Publication Name. Enter a name that is unique amongst all publications.
 Publish. Check the boxes next to the tables that are to be included in the
publication. Alternatively or in addition, click the Use Wildcard Selection button
to use wildcard pattern matching for selecting publication tables.
 Select All. Check this box if you want to include all tables in the Available Tables
list in the publication.
 Use Wildcard Selection. Click this button to use the wildcard selector to choose
tables for the publication. See Section 7.1 for information on the wildcard
selector.

Figure 6-5 - Create Publication dialog box
If you wish to use table filters during replications between master nodes in this multi-
master replication system, follow the directions in the next step to define the initial set of
available table filters, otherwise go on to Step 4.
Step 3 (Optional): Table filters consist of a set of filter rules that control the selection
criteria for rows replicated between master nodes during a snapshot or a synchronization
replication.
Note: See Section 2.2.12.3 for table setup requirements for a log-based replication
system as well as general restrictions on the use of table filters.
A filter rule consists of a filter name and a SQL WHERE clause (omitting the WHERE
keyword) called the filter clause, which you specify for a table that defines the selection
criteria for rows that are to be included during a replication.
Multiple filter rules may be defined for each table in the publication. If no filter rule is
defined for a given table, then no filtering can be later enabled on that corresponding
table in any master node of the multi-master replication system.
After filter rules have been defined for a publication table, you can later choose whether
or not to enable those filter rules on any master node in the replication system in
accordance with the following rules.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 258
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
 At most one filter rule can be enabled on a given table in a given master node.
 The same filter rule may be enabled on the same given table in several, different
master nodes.
 Different filter rules may be enabled on the same given table but in different
master nodes.
If you want to define table filters on the publication tables, click the Table Filters tab.
Select the table from the Table/View drop-down list for which you wish to add a filter
rule. Click the Add Filter button.
In the Filter dialog box, enter a descriptive filter name and the filter clause to select the
rows you want to replicate. The filter name and filter clause must meet the following
conditions:
 For any given table, each filter rule must be assigned a unique filter name.
 For any given table, the filter clauses must have different syntaxes (that is, the
filtering criteria must be different).
In the following example a filter rule is defined on the dept table so only rows where the
deptno column contains 10, 20, or 30 are included in replications. All other rows are
excluded from replication.
Figure 6-6 - Adding a filter rule for the dept table

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
The following shows a rule added to the emp table by choosing edb.emp from the
Table/View drop-down list and then entering the selection criteria for only rows with
deptno containing 10 in the Filter dialog box.
Figure 6-7 - Adding a filter rule for the emp table
Repeating this process, additional filter rules can be added for the emp table. The
following shows the complete set of available filter rules defined for the dept and emp
tables.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 260
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Figure 6-8 - Set of all available filter rules
To remove a filter rule, click the primary mouse button on the filter rule you wish to
remove so the entry is highlighted and then click the Remove Filter button.
You may also modify the filter name or filter clause of a filter rule listed in the Table
Filters tab by double-clicking on the cell of the filter name or filter clause you wish to
change. When the cursor appears in the cell, enter the text for the desired change.
When creating additional master nodes, you may selectively enable these table filters on
the corresponding tables in the additional master nodes. See Section 6.3 for information
on creating additional master nodes.
Note: To enable table filters on the master definition node under which you are currently
creating the publication, you must first switch the role of the master definition node to a
different master node (see Section 6.10), and then follow the directions in Section 6.9 to
enable the table filters.
This completes the process of defining table filters. The next step is changing conflict
resolution options.
If you wish to change the conflict resolution options from their default settings, follow
the directions in the next step, otherwise go on to Step 5.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 261
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Step 4 (Optional): If you want to modify or see the current conflict resolution options,
click the Conflict Resolution Options tab. For each table, you can select the primary
conflict resolution strategy and a standby strategy by clicking the primary mouse button
over the appropriate box to expose a drop-down list of choices.
Figure 6-9 - Conflict Resolution Options tab
If during synchronization replication, conflicting changes are pending against the same
row from different master nodes, the conflict resolution strategy determines which of the
conflicting changes is accepted and replicated to all master nodes. The conflicting
changes that are not accepted are discarded.
If the selection from the Conflict Resolution Strategy column does not resolve the
conflict, the selection from the Standby Conflict Resolution Strategy column is applied. If
neither strategy resolves the conflict, the event is marked as Pending in the Conflict
History tab. See Section 6.7 for information on viewing conflict history.
An example of a conflict is when the same column of the same row is changed by
transactions in two different master nodes. Depending upon the conflict resolution
strategy in effect for the table, one of the transactions is accepted and replicated to all
master nodes. The other transaction is discarded and not replicated to any master node.
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 262
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
The following is a brief summary of each conflict resolution strategy:
 Earliest Timestamp. The conflicting change with the earliest timestamp is
accepted and replicated to all other master nodes. All other conflicting changes
are discarded.
 Latest Timestamp. The conflicting change with the latest timestamp is accepted
and replicated to all other master nodes. All other conflicting changes are
discarded.
 Node Priority. The conflicting change occurring on the master node with the
highest priority level is accepted and replicated to all other master nodes. All
other conflicting changes are discarded.
 Custom. Update/update conflicts are resolved with a PL/pgSQL custom conflict
handling program.
 Manual. The conflict remains unresolved. Conflicting changes remain applied in
each master node where they originated, but are not replicated to other master
nodes. The proper adjustments must be manually applied in each master node.
See Section 6.6.4 for more information on conflict resolution strategies.
Step 5: If you expect update/update conflicts, then set the REPLICA IDENTITY option to
FULL on those tables where the conflicts are expected to occur. See Section 6.6.1 for
additional information.
Step 6: Click the Create button. If Publication Created Successfully appears, click the
OK button, otherwise investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

6.3 Creating Additional Master Nodes
Once you have created the master definition node, you add additional databases to the
multi-master replication system by defining additional master nodes.
This is done by creating additional publication database definitions subordinate to the
MMR type node under the Publication Server node that contains the master definition
node.
After the publication database definition is created, a Publication Database node
representing the master node appears in the replication tree of the xDB Replication
Console. The publication that was defined under the master definition node appears under
the Publication Database node.
You must enter database connection information such as the database server network
address, database identifier, and database login user name and password when you create
the publication database definition. The connection information is used by the publication
server to access the publication tables when it performs replication.
Step 1: Make sure the database server for the master definition node is running and
accepting client connections.
Step 2: Select the MMR type node under the same Publication Server node that contains
the master definition node. From the Publication menu, choose Publication Database, and
then choose Add Database. Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the MMR
type node and choose Add Database. The Publication Service – Add Database dialog box
appears.
Step 3: Fill in the following fields:
 Database Type. Select PostgreSQL or Postgres Plus Advanced Server for the
master node. For an Advanced Server Oracle compatible installation, select the
Postgres Plus Advanced Server option. For PostgreSQL or an Advanced Server
PostgreSQL compatible installation, select the PostgreSQL option.
 Host. IP address of the host on which the master node is running.
 Port. Port on which the master node is listening for connections.
 User. The database user name for the master node created in Step 1 of Section
6.1.4.
 Password. Password of the database user.
 Database. Enter the database name of the master node.
 URL Options (For SSL connectivity). Enter the URL options to establish SSL
connectivity to the master node. See Section 7.11 for information on using SSL
connections.
 Changeset Logging (For Postgres). This setting is predetermined by the
selection on the master definition node (see Section 6.2.2). Table Triggers is for
the trigger-based method of synchronization replication. WAL Stream is for the
Copyright © 2010 - 2018 EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved. 265
EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
log-based method of synchronization replication. See Section 2.2.9 for
information on the trigger-based method. See Section 2.2.10 for information on
the log-based method.
 Node Priority Level. An integer from 1 to 10, which is the priority level assigned
to this master node for conflict resolution based on node priority. The highest
priority is 1 while the lowest is 10. See Section 6.6.4 for information on conflict
resolution strategies. As each additional master node is added, the default priority
level number increases assigning a lower priority level to each additional node.
 Replicate Publication Schema. Check this box if you want the publication server
to create the publication table definitions in the new master node by copying the
definitions from the master definition node. If you do not check this box, it is
assumed that you have already created the table definitions in the master node. If
you are using the offline snapshot technique to create this master node, do not
check this box. See Section 7.9 for information on using an offline snapshot.
 Perform Initial Snapshot. Check this box if you want the publication server to
perform a snapshot from the master definition node to this master node when you
click the Save button. If you do not check this box, the tables on the master node
will not be loaded until you perform a replication at some later time. If you are
using the offline snapshot technique to create this master node, you should have
already loaded the table rows. Therefore do not check this box unless you want to
reload the data. See Section 7.9 for information on using an offline snapshot.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Figure 6-12 - Publication Service - Add Database dialog box for an additional master node
Note: Unless you intend to use the offline snapshot technique (see Section 7.9), it is
suggested that you check the Perform Initial Snapshot box. An initial snapshot replication
must be performed from the master definition node to every other master node before
performing synchronization replications on demand (see Section 6.5.2) or by a schedule
(see Section 7.2). If a newly added master node did not undergo an initial snapshot, any
subsequent synchronization replication may fail to apply the transactions to that master
node. The initial snapshot can also be taken by performing an on demand snapshot (see
Section 6.5.1).
Step 4: Click the Test button. If Test Result: Success appears, click the OK button.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Figure 6-13 - Successful master node test
If an error message appears investigate the cause of the error, correct the problem, and
repeat steps 1 through 4.
Step 5 (Optional): If you defined a set of available table filters for the publication, you
have the option of enabling these filters on this master node. See Section 6.2.3 for
instructions on defining table filters. If you do not wish to filter the rows that are
replicated to this master node, go to Step 6.
Note: See Section 2.2.12.3 for table setup requirements for a log-based replication
system as well as general restrictions on the use of table filters.
Click the Filter Rules tab to apply one or more filter rules to the master node. At most
one filter rule may be enabled on any given table in the master node.
In the following example the filter named dept_10_20_30 is enabled on the dept table
and the filter named dept_30 is enabled on the emp table of this master node.

Step 6: Check the Perform Initial Snapshot box if you want the publication server to
perform a snapshot from the master definition node to this master node when you click
the Save button. If you do not check this box, the tables on the master node will not be
loaded until you perform a replication at some later time.
If you are using the offline snapshot technique to create this master node, you should
