3 mmTAG OVERVIEW
mmTag is a low-power high-data-rate wireless network, achieved
by operating at a mmWave frequency band while benefiting from
the low-power nature of backscatter technology. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, mmTag is a system consists of one or more nodes which en-
able high-data-rate, low-power communication links to a mmWave
AP. The AP uses directional antennas to create transmitting and
receiving beams with orthogonal polarization. Then, it steers these
beams together while transmitting a query signal. When the beams
are facing toward a node, the node modulates, changes polarization
and reflects the signal back to the direction of arrival (i.e. direction
of the AP). The AP receives the backscattered signal, separates
it from its own transmitted query signal, and decodes the node’s
message. Note, if the line-of-sight (LOS) path between the node and
the AP is blocked, the AP chooses a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) path
to communicate. The design of mmTag ’s node does not require
expensive or power hungry components such as phase array, DAC,
mixer or baseband hardware. Moreover, it can be directly connected
to a (GPIO) port of a microcontroller or an FPGA which is already
available in user devices such as cameras, augmented reality (AR)
headsets, or IoT devices providing high-data-rate connectivity.
Over the next few sections, we will first discuss how a mmTag
node creates and steers a beam toward the AP without using active
mmWave components and phased arrays. In particular, we explain
how we can build a node which reflects the signal to the direction
of arrival, regardless of the angle of incidence. Then, we explain
how mmTag solves the interference problem and enables the AP
to separate the backscattered signal from the query signal without
using full-duplex hardware. Finally, we show how mmTag’s nodes
perform data modulation and communicate to AP for any angle
and orientation.
4 BEAM ALIGNMENT CHALLENGE
As mentioned earlier, mmWave signals decay quickly as distance
increases. Therefore, to achieve a reasonable communication range
in a mmWave network, mmWave radios need to use directional
antennas to focus their energy into a very narrow beam, compen-
sating for the signal loss. Moreover, mmWave radios must be able to
steer their beams to enable communication between mobile nodes,
as shown in Figure 1. A steerable directional antenna is typically

implemented using a phased array. A phased array is an array of
antennas, where each antenna is connected to a phase shifter. The
phase shifter controls the phase of the signal on each antenna,
which enables creating and steering a beam electronically. Finally,
in order to find the correct direction for beam alignment, recent
work has proposed different search techniques [10, 16, 22, 42, 46].
Similar to traditional mmWave networks, mmTag requires both
the AP and nodes to use steerable directional beams and search for
their correct direction. However, existing beam alignment schemes
are not suitable for mmTag’s nodes due to two reasons. First, all
of these schemes require nodes to transmit and/or measure the
received signals. However, a backscatter node does not have any
transmitter or receiver radio; it can only reflect signals. Second,
existing schemes require phased arrays which have high power
consumption (a few watts) and are costly [4, 26]. In the following
subsections, we explain how we build on the Van Atta technique
to solve the beam alignment problem of backscatter nodes with-
out using any active block (such as phased arrays, transmitter or
receiver) in mmTag’s design.
(a) Active Approach
4.1 Principles of Antenna Array
Before explaining the solution, we first provide some principles
about antenna arrays. An antenna array is an array of 𝑁 antennas,
spatially separated by distance 𝑑. In an antenna array, the signal
received by the 𝑛𝑡ℎ antenna element can be written as:
𝑥𝑛 = 𝑥0 · 𝑒−𝑗𝐾0·𝑛·𝑑·𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃); 𝑛 ∈ [0 : 𝑁 − 1],
(1)
where 𝐾0 is the free space wave number and 𝜃 is the angle of signal
arrival. In a typical antenna array, 𝑑 = 𝜆
𝜆 , where 𝜆 is
the wavelength of the signal. We can simplify Eq. (1) to:
2 and 𝐾0 = 2𝜋
𝑥𝑛 = 𝑥0 · 𝑒−𝑗𝜋·𝑛·𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃); 𝑛 ∈ [0 : 𝑁 − 1]
(2)
This equation shows that if we want to receive a signal from a
specific direction (𝜃), we can multiply the received signal at each
antenna with 𝑒 𝑗𝜋 .𝑛.𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃) and then sum them. Similarly, this equa-
tion implies that if we want to use an antenna array to transmit
a signal to a specific direction (𝜃), we need to feed the following
signal to each antenna:
𝑦𝑛 = 𝑦0 · 𝑒+𝑗𝜋 .𝑛.𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃); 𝑛 ∈ [0 : 𝑁 − 1]
(3)
where 𝑛 is the antenna number, and 𝑦0 is the signal fed to the
first antenna. Note that the only difference between Eq. (2) (i.e.
equation for receiving from direction 𝜃) and Eq. (3) (i.e. equation
for transmitting to direction 𝜃) is the inverted signal phases.
4.2 Passive Beam Searching
Now, we explain how we solve the beam alignment problem in
mmTag’s nodes. The backscatter nodes require having two beams,
one for receiving the signal from the AP and one for reflecting the
signal back to the AP. Due to the symmetry of forward and back-
ward channels in backscatter communication, the correct direction
for these two beams are the same. Said differently, the nodes need
to reflect the signal back towards the direction of arrival. Now, the
question here is how can we build a passive reflector which reflects
the received signal back in the direction of arrival, regardless of
the arrival (incidence) angle. Note, this is different from a typical

(b) Passive Approach (mmTag)

proaches. The solid arrows show the received signal and the
dashed arrows show the reflected signal of each antenna el-

while in (b) each antenna reflects the signal received by its

reflector (such as mirror) which does this only when the angle of
incidence is 0 degree.
Using principles of an antenna array described in Section 4.1,
we can show that one approach to build such a node is to design
an antenna array where each antenna element reverses the phase
of the received signal, reflecting it back from where it came. This
would give us a backscatter node which reflects the signal back to
the same direction as the incidence angle for any incidence angle.
Now, the next question deals with how we can reverse a phase of
the signal.
A common way to reverse the phase of a signal is to use the
phase reversal circuits, as shown in Figure 3(a). However, these
circuits are complex and power hungry, hence are not suitable
for a passive backscatter node. To solve this problem and build a
mmWave backscatter node which reflects to the same direction
as arrival direction, we design a device using Van Atta which is a

technique for building reflector array [39]. As shown in Figure 3
(b), we use an array of antennas where each antenna is connected
to its mirrored antenna using a transmission line.1 Therefore, each
antenna receives a signal and passes it to its mirrored antenna to
reflect it. Now, if we carefully design the transmission lines to have
the same phase shifts between antenna pairs, the reflected signal
from 𝑛𝑡ℎ antenna element will be:
𝑦′
𝑛 = 𝑒 𝑗𝜙 · 𝑥𝑁−𝑛−1; 𝑛 ∈ [0 : 𝑁 − 1]
(4)
where 𝑥𝑁−𝑛−1 is the signal received by the (𝑁 − 𝑛 − 1)𝑡ℎ antenna
element, and 𝜙 is the phase shift caused by the transmission lines.
Then using Eq.1, we can write:
𝑦′
𝑛 = 𝑒 𝑗𝜙 · 𝑥0 · 𝑒−𝑗𝜋 (𝑁−𝑛−1)·𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃)
= 𝑒 𝑗𝜙 · 𝑒−𝑗·𝜋·(𝑁−1)·𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃) · 𝑥0 · 𝑒+𝑗·𝜋·𝑛·𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃)
= 𝑦′
0 · 𝑒+𝑗·𝜋·𝑛·𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜃); 𝑛 ∈ [0 : 𝑁 − 1]
(5)
Figure 4: Data Modulation. mmTag’s node uses a SPDT to
switch between two transmission lines with different length.
This allows the node to modulate the signal.
By comparing Eq.5 with Eq.3, we can see that mmTag’s node
creates a directional reflector which reflects the signal back to the
direction of arrival regardless of incidence angle. Therefore, this
design enables the node to reflect the signal back to the same path
through which the signal has arrived from the AP. Note, the path
between the node and the AP can be either LOS or NLOS. mmTag
uses this design to solve the beam alignment problem of backscatter
nodes without using any active components.
4.3 Data Modulation
So far we have explained how mmTag solves the beam alignment
problem. However, to enable the node to send data to the AP, it
must first modulate the signal before reflecting it back to the AP.
Note, the backscatter node needs to do this using a simple and low-
power approach. One naïve solution is to use a similar technique
as traditional backscatter systems such as RFID. In these systems,
an RF switch is used to connect the antenna to the ground plane.
When the switch is on, the antenna is connected to the ground
and does not reflect the query signal, and when the switch is off,
the antenna reflects the query signal. Unfortunately, this simple
approach does not work for mmWave backscatter nodes because
RF switches have high leakage at mmWave frequencies when the
switch is off, and hence the the signal reflection does not change
much by turning the switch on or off.
To solve this problem, we use Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT)
switches, where the input port of each SPDT is connected to an
antenna, and the two output ports of SPDTs are connected to two
transmission lines with different length, as shown in Figure 4. The
length of these lines are carefully chosen such that when the an-
tenna is connected to line L1, the antenna is tuned, and hence it
resonates and reflects the signal back. On the other hand, when the
the antenna is connected to the line L2, the antenna is not tuned
and therefore does not reflect the signal back. Therefore, by turning
the switches on or off, the node can change the amplitude of the re-
flected signal. Note, this technique does not impact on the phase of
the signal and hence the reflected signal still goes back to the arrival
direction. Finally, by connecting the data stream to the control line
of switches, a mmTag’s node can modulate the reflected signal and

embed its data. For example, when the data bit is ’1’, the switches
are in 1 positions and the amplitude of the reflected power is high
at the AP. When the data bit is ’0’, the switches are in 0 position and
the AP receives no reflected signal from the backscatter node. As a
result, the AP can simply decode the node’s data using Amplitude
Shift Keying (ASK) demodulation. Although ASK is not as spectral
efficient as complex modulations such as QAM, it is very attractive
for backscatter devices since it does not require complex hardware
with high power consumption. Furthermore, in Section 7 we will
discuss how mmTag exploits the directional property of mmWave
communication to enable the spacial frequency reuse and improve
the spectrum usage.
5 SELF INTERFERENCE CHALLENGE
So far, we have explained how we build a backscatter node which
modulates and reflects the query signal back to the AP without
using active and power hungry components. Now, the question
is how the AP can separate the node’s signal from its own signal.
Note, this is very challenging since the the reflected signal is much
weaker than the query signal. In particular, when the node is far
from the AP, the reflected signal is orders of magnitude smaller than
the AP’s query signal. Unfortunately, the AP can not amplify the
reflected signal since the self-interference signal also gets amplified,
results in the saturation of AP’s receiver.
One might imagine that since mmWave radios use directional
antennas, the leakage between the transmitter and receiver beam
should be negligible. However, past work shows that there still ex-
ists a significant amount of leakage between their transmitter and
receiver beams [3]. This leakage is problematic since it limits the
amplification gain of the AP’s receiver, and hence it significantly
limits the operating range of our system. One possible approach
to solve this problem is to use a full-duplex radio in the AP side
to enable the AP to cancel the strong interference coming from its
own transmission to the receiver. In fact, past backscatter systems
(such as RFID) which operate at lower RF bands use these technique
to reduce the self-interfering problem. However, full-duplex radios
operating at mmWave frequencies are not commercially available.

Furthermore, the mmWave full-duplex radios proposed in the liter-
ature require complex and expensive hardware and do not perform
beam searching which is essential for mobile applications [40].
5.1 Polarization Conversion
To solve the self-interference problem, we use the polarization prop-
erty of antennas. In general, antennas have different polarization.
In order for two antennas to hear each other, their polarization
must be aligned. Said differently, if two antennas use orthogonal
polarization, they will not hear each other’s signal. Hence, mm-
Tag’s AP solves the interference problem by using antennas with
orthogonal polarization for its transmitter and receiver. Although
this solves the self-interference problem, it causes a new problem;
the AP does not hear the the node’s signal either. Therefore, for this
idea to work, the node must change the polarization of the signal
before reflecting it back. In other words, if the AP transmits the
signal in polarization A, the node should receive this signal, and
reflect it back in polarization B, which is orthogonal to polarization
A. Note, since the other reflectors in the environment do not change
the signal polarization, and only the signal reflected by the node
has experienced polarization change, the AP can easily separate the
node’s backscattered signal from other signals including its own
transmitted query signal.
In order to change the polarization of the backscatter signal, we
design a patch antenna which has two ports as shown in Figure 5(a).
Each port corresponds to one polarization. In particular, if we feed
a signal into port X, the polarization of the radiated wave would
be in X direction and if we feed the signal into the other port (port
Y), the polarization would be in Y direction. This design enables us
to have an antenna which can operate in two different orthogonal
polarization depending on which port is used. Next, we use multiple
versions of these patch antennas and build a reflector array as
explained in Section 4. However, since each antenna has two ports,
we connect port X of each antenna to port Y of its mirrored antenna
as shown in Figure 5(b). This design enables the node to change the
polarization of the received signal from X direction to Y direction
and vice versa, as shown in Figure 6(a).
So far, we have explained how the node can change the signal
polarization from X direction to Y direction and vice versa. How-
ever, depending on the orientation of the node, the arrival signal
