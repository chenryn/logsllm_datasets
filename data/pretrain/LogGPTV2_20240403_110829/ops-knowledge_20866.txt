"B": "Enforcing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.",
"C": "Upgrading the browser to the latest version to patch any old vulnerabilities that allow data leakage.",
"D": "Using only POST requests for all operations, as they are not susceptible to XSSI attacks."
