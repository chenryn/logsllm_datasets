ABSTRACT
Botnets pose a serious threat to the health of the Internet.
Most current network-based botnet detection systems re-
quire deep packet inspection (DPI) to detect bots. Because
DPI is a computational costly process, such detection sys-
tems cannot handle large volumes of traﬃc typical of large
enterprise and ISP networks. In this paper we propose a sys-
tem that aims to eﬃciently and eﬀectively identify a small
number of suspicious hosts that are likely bots. Their traﬃc
can then be forwarded to DPI-based botnet detection sys-
tems for ﬁne-grained inspection and accurate botnet detec-
tion. By using a novel adaptive packet sampling algorithm
and a scalable spatial-temporal ﬂow correlation approach,
our system is able to substantially reduce the volume of net-
work traﬃc that goes through DPI, thereby boosting the
scalability of existing botnet detection systems. We imple-
mented a proof-of-concept version of our system, and eval-
uated it using real-world legitimate and botnet-related net-
work traces. Our experimental results are very promising
and suggest that our approach can enable the deployment
of botnet-detection systems in large, high-speed networks.

bots) that are remotely controlled by an attacker (a.k.a.,
botmaster ). Botnets can be instructed to commit various
malicious activities, such as launching distributed denial-
of-service (DDoS) attacks, sending spam, performing click
fraud, or stealing private information. To eﬀectively control
a botnet, the botmaster establishes a command and control
(C&C) channel with the bots, through which the malicious
activities can be coordinated.
A number of approaches for network-based botnet detec-
tion have been recently proposed [4, 8, 6, 5, 12, 14, 23,
17]. Almost all of these systems apply ﬁne-grained analysis
(e.g., deep packet inspection (DPI)) in order to detect bot-
compromised machines. For example, BotHunter [6] uses a
payload-based anomaly detector and a signature-based de-
tection engine. BotSniﬀer [5] and Rishi [8] need to parse the
content of IRC communications. TAMD [23] inspects packet
payloads to compute content similarity scores. BotMiner [7]
requires DPI to perform activity-plane (A-Plane) monitor-
ing, such as binary downloading and remote exploit detec-
tion. Although BotMiner’s communication-plane (C-Plane)
analysis does not require DPI, it suﬀers from scalability is-
sues that prevents its deployment in high-speed networks
(Section 6.3). While these systems have shown promis-
ing results, because DPI is computationally expensive, they
cannot be directly deployed in high-speed networks without
special (usually very expensive) hardware support. Further-
more, even when special hardware support is available, most
of the proposed techniques may still not be able to keep up
with the traﬃc, due to the relatively high computational
cost of their traﬃc analysis algorithms. Load-balancing (i.e.,
distributing traﬃc and computation to multiple processing
units) may represent a possible solution. However, a de-
ployment of these systems in load-balancing requires special
design and signiﬁcant changes to the existing detection al-
gorithms.
In this paper, we propose a new packet sampling and scal-
able spatial-temporal ﬂow correlation approach that aims to
eﬃciently and eﬀectively identify a small number of suspi-
cious hosts that are likely bots. Their traﬃc can be for-
warded to ﬁne-grained botnet detectors for further analysis.
This allows us to signiﬁcantly reduce the amount of traﬃc
on which ﬁne-grained analysis such as DPI is applied. Thus,
we boost the scalability of botnet detection for high-speed
and high-volume networks.
Network ﬂow analysis typically requires far fewer resources
than DPI. However, collecting precise network ﬂow informa-
tion in high-speed networks is challenging, because we may
not be able to aﬀord to process every packet in the network.
In order to solve this problem, packet sampling techniques
are commonly employed to reduce the number of packets to
be processed. For example, uniform sampling and its vari-
ant periodic sampling are among the most popular packet
sampling techniques, and they allow a network operator to
reconstruct approximate network ﬂow information. How-
ever, their limitation is that they are able to reconstruct rel-
atively precise information about large ﬂows (i.e., ﬂows that
carry a high number of packets), such as media streaming
ﬂows, but may poorly approximate or miss outright infor-
mation about small and medium ﬂows. In order to address
this issue, some new sampling algorithms have been recently
proposed. For example, FlexSample [2] is a programmable
framework where a network operator can set conditions to
increase the sampling rates packets from speciﬁc traﬃc sub-
populations (e.g., packets in small and medium ﬂows). Un-
fortunately, because diﬀerent botnet implementations may
introduce strong diversity in the properties (e.g., ﬂow size)
of their C&C communication ﬂows, it is challenging to set
conditions that allow FlexSample to sample packets target-
ted for a wide range of botnet C&Cs. For example, ﬂows of
HTTP-based C&Cs are usually small (i.e., short lived) while
those related to IRC-based C&Cs are intrinsically larger. In
order to address this problem, we introduce a new adaptive
sampling technique. Our sampling technique is botnet-aware
since it is driven by intrinsic characteristics of botnets such
as group similarity, where the group similarity reﬂects the
fact that bots belonging to the same botnet share similar
C&C communication patterns. We also propose a new scal-
able spatial-temporal correlation approach to identify hosts
that share persistently similar communications. That is, we
aim to identify hosts in a network that persistently share
similar communication patterns for a relatively long (not
necessarily continuous) period of time. Our spatial-temporal
ﬂow correlation analysis is motivated by the following ob-
servation. Because of their (illegal) economy-driven nature,
botnets are used by the botmasters for as long as possible to
maximize proﬁts (e.g., several months, or until the botnet is
dismantled by law enforcement), so their C&C communica-
tions will be active for a relatively long period of time.
This paper makes the following contributions:
1. We propose a network traﬃc analysis approach for bot-
net detection in high-speed and high-volume networks.
The objective of our analysis is to eﬃciently and ef-
fectively narrow down suspicious hosts that are likely
bots. The network traﬃc generated by these suspicious
hosts can then be forwarded to ﬁne-grained botnet de-
tectors for further analysis.
2. We introduce an adaptive sampling technique based
on group similarity, an intrinsic characteristic of bot-
nets, to sample packets that are likely related to C&C
communications with high probability.
3. We propose a new scalable spatial-temporal correla-
tion analysis to identify hosts in a network that share
persistently similar communication patterns, which is
one of the main characteristics of botnets.
4. We implemented a proof-of-concept version of our sys-
tem, and evaluated it using real-world legitimate and
botnet-related network traces. Our experimental re-
sults show that the proposed approach is scalable and
can eﬀectively detect bots with few false positives,
which can be further reduced by ﬁne-grained botnet
detection systems.
2. RELATED WORK
Researchers have proposed many approaches to detect
botnets. Some of the approaches [14, 17, 12, 8, 4] are de-
signed for detecting botnets with IRC-based C&Cs. Re-
cently, researchers proposed an approach to diﬀerentiate P2P
bots from P2P ﬁle sharing applications [18]. These ap-
proaches detect botnets with either IRC- or P2P-based C&Cs,
while our system can detect both. Some other detection
approaches are driven by speciﬁc attack information (i.e.,
spam). Ramachandran et al. [15] used DNSBL to iden-
tify bots for spamming, while Zhao et al. used Hotmail
logs in BotGraph [22]. Hu et al. [20] proposed RB-Seeker
to detect redirection botnets based on spam and network
ﬂow information. Compared to these approaches, our sys-
tem mainly use packet header and network ﬂow information,
which indicates a wider deployment. Some detection algo-
rithms uses correlation approaches. BotHunter [6] associates
IDS events to a pre-deﬁned bot infection dialog model for
detection. BotSniﬀer [5] leverages the homogeneity of mes-
sages and activities to identify botnet C&Cs. Yen et al. [23]
proposed TAMD to detect bots by aggregating traﬃc which
shares the same external destination, similar payloads and
OS platforms. BotMiner [7] is a protocol- and structure-
independent botnet detection system using clustering tech-
niques. These systems depend on DPI-based components,
which limit their usage in high-speed networks. In our sys-
tem, we design botnet-aware packet sampling algorithm and
scalable spatial-temporal ﬂow correlation approach for eﬃ-
cient and eﬀective botnet detection, which aims at the de-
ployment in high-speed networks.
Various sampling algorithms have been proposed to re-
duce the amount of data the network devices have to pro-
cess in high speed networks and infer the traﬃc statistics
based on the sampled packets. Most of them focus on sam-
pling large ﬂows and improving their estimation accuracy
[21]. Recently researchers proposed approaches to focus on
sampling packets in small ﬂows. Kumar et al. [1] and Hu
et al. [9] proposed algorithms to sample packets in small
ﬂows. However, their overall sampling rate depends on the
Zipﬁan nature [19] of Internet and thus they cannot achieve
a pre-deﬁned target sampling rate. Ramachandran et al.
[2] designed FlexSample, which can sample packets based
on pre-deﬁned conditions. FlexSample can be conﬁgured
to capture packets in small/medium ﬂows while keeping a
target sampling rate. However, characteristics of network
ﬂows for botnet C&Cs exhibit great diversity among diﬀer-
ent botnets and thus it is very challenging to propose good
conditions to describe all the ﬂows of botnet C&Cs. There-
fore, these existing sampling algorithms maybe ineﬀective to
sample packets for botnet C&Cs. In contrast to the above
sampling algorithms, our algorithm is driven by the intrin-
sic characteristics of botnet C&Cs, and thus our sampling
algorithm captures more botnet packets related ﬂows given
a certain sampling rate.

The Flow-Capture module aims to monitor the traﬃc at
the edge of high-speed networks to gather network ﬂow infor-
mation, based on the sampled packets. The Flow-Capture
module is divided in two components: Packet-Sampling
and Flow-Assembler. Packet-Sampling is a botnet-aware
sampling algorithm. Given an overall target sampling proba-
bility (SRT arget), it samples packets likely related to botnet
C&C communications and delivers them to Flow-Assembler,
along with their corresponding instant sampling probabil-
ities (Section 4). The Flow-Assembler reconstructs ﬂow
information, and assembles the sampled packets into raw
ﬂows (deﬁned in Section 4.2).
The Flow-Correlation module groups ﬂows output by Flow-
Assembler into C-ﬂows (deﬁned in Section 5.1). A C-ﬂow is
an abstraction introduced in BotMiner [7] to represent the
C&C communication patterns of potential bots. Each C-
ﬂow represents a view of the communication patterns from
a monitored host to a remote service over a certain epoch
(e.g, 12 hours). Flow-Correlation applies a scalable clus-
tering algorithm over the C-ﬂows to identify hosts that ex-
hibit similar communication patterns towards machines out-
side the monitored network. This step is similar to the C-
Plane analysis performed by BotMiner [7], but there are
two fundamental diﬀerences. First, we use a signiﬁcantly
more eﬃcient ﬂow clustering process (see Section 5.2), com-
pared to BotMiner, which can handle large traﬃc volumes
typical of high-speed networks. Second, unlike BotMiner,
our Flow-Correlation module performs cross-epoch correla-
tion to identify hosts that show persistently similar com-
munication pattens, a telltale sign of botnets. Any pair of
hosts that exhibit persistently similar communication pat-
terns will then be labeled as suspicious hosts (potential bots)
and delivered to the Fine-Grained Detector for further in-
depth analysis. The Fine-Grained Detector can then focus
on monitoring the packets related to only the suspicious IPs
provided by our Flow-Correlation module, thus reducing the
overall cost of the botnet detection process.
The design and implementation of the Flow-Capture and
Flow-Correlation modules and the detection framework are
the main contributions of this work. Existing DPI-based
botnet detectors can be plugged within our framework with
little or no modiﬁcation to constitute the Fine-Grained De-
