Unified management and monitoring: Container orchestration tools provide a unified interface to manage and monitor all container instances, as well as application health status, logs, and metrics. 3. Port portability across hosts and clouds: Container orchestration tools can port applications between different hosts and cloud platforms, providing greater flexibility and portability for cross-platform and cross-cloud applications. 4. Compatible with existing tools and processes: Container orchestration tools can be integrated with existing development and operations tools, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of container orchestration without disrupting current workflows and processes. 5. Improve reliability and security: Container orchestration tools can guarantee high reliability and security of applications, including automatic application start and stop, load balancing and failover.
