### Title: Let's Dance in the Cache - Destabilizing Hash Tables on Microsoft IIS

**Abstract:**

Hash tables, as a fundamental data structure in computer science, are widely used in software architecture to store and retrieve data in an associative manner. However, their design makes them susceptible to collision attacks. To address this, Microsoft developed its own dynamic hashing algorithm 25 years ago, which has been extensively implemented in IIS (Internet Information Services), Microsoft's web server, to manage various types of data within the HTTP stack.

Given the ubiquity of hash tables in IIS, it is crucial to scrutinize the robustness of Microsoft's design. Through months of reverse-engineering efforts, we have delved into the internals of IIS to examine both the implementation of the hash table and the use of the hashing algorithms. Our research has uncovered several types of attacks, including:

1. **Zero-Hash Flooding Attack**: A specially designed attack targeting Microsoft's proprietary hashing algorithm.
2. **Cache Poisoning Attack**: An attack that exploits inconsistencies between hash keys.
3. **Authentication Bypass via Hash Collision**: An unusual method to bypass authentication by colliding identity caches.

By understanding these vulnerabilities, the audience will gain insights into why hash tables can be easily destabilized. We will also share our methodology for exploring IIS internals and present surprising results. These findings not only demonstrate how a default IIS server can be made to hang with 100% CPU usage but also show how arbitrary HTTP responses can be modified through crafted HTTP requests. Additionally, we will demonstrate a technique to bypass authentication requirements using a single, carefully crafted password that causes a hash collision in the identity cache.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Understanding the vulnerabilities in Microsoft's hash table implementation.
- Techniques for reverse-engineering and analyzing IIS internals.
- Methods to exploit hash table weaknesses, including flooding, poisoning, and authentication bypass.
- Practical demonstrations of the impact of these attacks on IIS performance and security.
