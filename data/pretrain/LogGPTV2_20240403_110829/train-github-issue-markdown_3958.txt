To work around #20096 we introduced a --hairpin-mode flag that flips cbr0 to
promiscuous mode. Users of kubenet run with --configure-cbr0=false, so before
we push kubenet to production we need to decide how to handle this.
If we decided to stick with promiscuous mode, kubenet should set it on
whatever bridge it creates. We will (hopefully) not have to continue relying
on promiscuous mode on newer kernel versions. Maybe it still makes sense to do
in the interim? or maybe we can push it down into the CNI bridge driver
(unsure of a valid generic use case to make a bridge promiscuous)?
