sensor APIs. Mobile sensing applications, such as the CMU
MobiSens[36], run as a service in the background and can
constantly collect sensors’ information from smartphones. Sen-
sors can be either hard sensors (e.g., accelerometers) that are
physically-sensing devices, or soft sensors that record infor-
mation of a phone’s running status (e.g., screen on/off). Thus,
practical sensors-based user authentication can be achieved
today. But which sensors should we select?
We use Fisher scores (FS)[37] to help select the most
promising sensors for user authentication. FS is one of the
most widely used supervised feature selection methods due to
its excellent performance. The Fisher Score enables ﬁnding
a subset of features, such that in the data space spanned by
the selected features, the distances between data points in
different classes are as large as possible, while the distances
between data points in the same class are as small as possible.
Table II shows the FS for different sensors that are widely
implemented in smartphones and smartwatches. We found that
the magnetometer, orientation sensor and light sensor have
lower FS because they are inﬂuenced by the environment.
This can introduce various background noise unrelated to the
user’s behavioral characteristics, e.g., the magnetometer may
be inﬂuenced by magnets. Therefore, we select two sensors,
the accelerometer and gyroscope, because they have higher
FS and furthermore, are the most common sensors built into
current smartphones and smartwatches [38].
These two sensors also represent different
information
about the user’s behavior: 1) the accelerometer records coarse-
grained motion patterns of a user, such as how she walks
[16]; and 2) the gyroscope records ﬁne-grained motions of
a user such as how she holds a smartphone [13]. Furthermore,
these sensors do not need the user’s permissions, making
them useful for continuous background monitoring in implicit
authentication scenarios.
C. What sensor features are best?
Using the raw sensor data streams from the selected sensors
may not be as good as using statistical features derived from
these raw sensor data streams. Hence, we segment the sensor
data streams into a series of time windows, and compute
statistics from both the time domain and the frequency domain
for the sensor data values in a time window. The magnitude
of sensor i’s data stream in the k-th window is denoted
Si(k). For example, the magnitude of an accelerometer data
x2 + y2 + z2. We
sample (t, x, y, z) is computed as m =
implement the Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [39] to obtain
the frequency domain information. The frequency domain
information is useful and is widely used in signal processing
and data analysis, e.g., speech signals and images.
(cid:2)
We compute the following statistical features derived from
each of the raw sensor streams, in each time window:
• Mean: Average value of the sensor stream
• Var: Variance of the sensor stream

We then test the performance of each feature and drop
“bad” features. If a feature can be used to easily distinguish
two users, we say the feature is a good feature. For a feature
to distinguish two different persons, it is necessary for the two
underlying distributions to be different. Hence, for each fea-
ture, we test whether this feature derived from different users
is from the same distribution. If most pairs of them are from
the same distribution, the feature is “bad” in distinguishing
two persons and we drop it.
