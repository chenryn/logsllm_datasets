#### 1. Motivation for the Semantic Web

The World Wide Web (WWW) was developed in 1989 at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee, a CERN researcher, created the first prototype of the WWW as an information system for physicists. By the end of 1990, Berners-Lee had developed the first browser to retrieve and view hypertext documents and the first Web server, which stores Web pages on a computer for others to access. Initially, the WWW was designed to facilitate information sharing within internationally dispersed working groups. It consisted of documents (i.e., Web pages) and links between these documents.

As the number of users and the amount of available information grew, the Web became a more attractive platform for information sharing. A Web page can be accessed via a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and a Web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla, Safari).

Currently, the World Wide Web is primarily composed of documents written in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), which is useful for visual presentation. HTML uses a set of markup symbols to format content for display on a Web browser. Most of the information on the Web is designed for human consumption, with little inherent meaning that can be interpreted by computers. To enable machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing, the information must be provided in a way that computers can understand. This is the objective of the Semantic Web, which aims to make it possible for computers to process Web information. As Berners-Lee, Hendler, and Lassila (2001) state, "The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation."

The Semantic Web was developed through incremental changes, adding machine-readable descriptions to the data and documents already on the Web. Figure 1 illustrates the various technologies that have made the Semantic Web possible. Initially, the Web was a vast set of static Web pages linked together. Many organizations still use static HTML files to deliver their information. However, to meet the dynamic nature of businesses, organizations are increasingly using dynamic publishing methods. These methods use server-side applications and database access techniques to create Web pages dynamically in response to user requests, offering highly customized content.

Despite the advantages of dynamic publishing, the technologies available for creating Web pages based on database information were insufficient for the needs of organizations seeking application integration solutions. Businesses required their heterogeneous systems and applications to communicate in a transactional manner. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) emerged as a successful solution for business-to-business integration, providing a means to transmit unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data between systems.

However, XML-based solutions were not sufficient because the data exchanged lacked explicit semantic descriptions. For true integration, applications must also include semantic integration, which involves using explicit semantic descriptions to facilitate interoperability. Currently, the Web is evolving, and various approaches are being explored to add semantics to Web resources. Figure 2 illustrates this evolution, showing the transition from a syntactic Web, where resources and links are undifferentiated, to a Semantic Web, where resources and relationships are characterized precisely.

To address the need for integration and interoperability, the research community has developed semantic standards such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). RDF provides a standard for creating descriptions of information, while OWL allows for the definition of structured Web-based ontologies, enabling richer integration and interoperability of data across communities and domains.

#### 2. The Visual and Syntactic Web

The World Wide Web, composed primarily of HTML documents, can be characterized as a visual Web, where documents are intended for display by Web browsers. In this context, machines cannot understand the meaning of the information in HTML pages, which are mainly composed of ASCII codes and images. This limitation hinders the automation of information processing, integration, and interoperability.

HTML documents use presentational metadata to assign information to content and affect its presentation. Metadata, or data about data, describes characteristics of a resource, such as a Web page, document, image, or file. For example, metadata might include the title, subject, author, and size of a file. In HTML, specific tags are used to mark up content, indicating the beginning and end of each element. For instance, the title of a Web page might be marked up using the `<title>` tag, and a heading might be marked up using the `<h1>` tag.

One limitation of HTML is its lack of rich vocabulary for capturing the meaning behind text. Search engines like Google read Web pages and match keywords, but they do not consider the metadata or the semantic meaning of HTML tags, limiting the effectiveness of searches.

In contrast, the Syntactic Web consists of documents that contain data not just for rendering by Web browsers but also for data integration and interoperability. XML, a versatile markup language, allows users to create new tags to add syntactic meaning to information. To enable data integration, the meaning of XML document content is determined by agreements between businesses, often defined using standardized documents like the Document Type Definition (DTD) or the XML Schema Definition (XSD).

Organizations use XML to exchange or move business data between information systems, accelerating the construction of systems that integrate distributed, heterogeneous data. The first step in data integration using XML involves converting raw data sources into well-formed XML documents. The next step is to analyze and document the structure by creating DTDs or XSDs for each data source.

However, XML can only define the syntax of documents and does not provide information about the meaning of the tags used. For example, an XML instance might indicate a student's name, ID, and major, but it does not provide the meaning of these fields or their relationships.

#### 3. Unstructured, Semi-Structured, and Structured Data

Data can be categorized into three broad types: unstructured, semi-structured, and structured (Figure 3).

- **Unstructured Data**: This includes text, files, videos, emails, reports, presentations, voice mails, office memos, and images. Unstructured data does not follow a specific format, rules, or sequence. For example, the data on HTML Web pages is unstructured and irregular. Although unstructured data can have some structure, such as predefined tags in HTML, it is not easily classified or stored in a structured database.

- **Semi-Structured Data**: This type of data lies between unstructured and structured data. It has some structure but is not rigidly defined. Semi-structured data includes unstructured components arranged according to a pre-determined structure. It can be specified in a way that allows querying using general-purpose mechanisms.

- **Structured Data**: This is typically found in databases, where every element of data has an assigned format and significance.

Figure 3 illustrates examples of unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data, highlighting the differences in their organization and accessibility.
