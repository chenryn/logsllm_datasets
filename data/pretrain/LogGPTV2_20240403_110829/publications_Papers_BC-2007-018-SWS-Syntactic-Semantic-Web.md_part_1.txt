1 Motivation for the Semantic Web
The World Wide Web (WWW) was developed in 1989 at the European Laboratory for
Particle Physics (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. It was Tim Berners-Lee who
developed the first prototype of the World Wide Web intended to serve as an
information system for physicists.
By the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee had written the first browser to retrieve and
view hypertext documents and wrote the first Web server – the software, which stores
Web pages on a computer for others to access. The system was originally developed to
allow information sharing within internationally dispersed working groups. The original
WWW consisted of documents (i.e. Web pages) and links between documents.
Browsers and Web server users grew. They became more and more attractive as an
information sharing infrastructure. The Web became even more interesting as the
amount of available information of every sort increased. A Web page can be accessed
by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) through the HyperText Transfer Protocol
(HTTP) using a Web browser (e.g. Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla, Safari).
Currently, the World Wide Web is primarily composed of documents written in
HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language), a language that is useful for visual
presentation. HTML is a set of “markup” symbols contained in a Web page intended for
display on a Web browser. Most of the information on the Web is designed only for
human consumption. Humans can read Web pages and understand them, but their
inherent meaning is not shown in a way that allows their interpretation by computers.
The information on the Web can be defined in a way that can be used by computers
not only for display purposes, but also for interoperability and integration between
systems and applications. One way to enable machine-to-machine exchange and
automated processing is to provide the information in such a way that computers can
understand it. This is precisely the objective of the semantic Web – to make possible the
processing of Web information by computers. “The Semantic Web is not a separate
Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined
meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.” (Berners-Lee,
Hendler et al. 2001). The next generation of the Web will combine existing Web
technologies with knowledge representation formalisms (Grau 2004)
The Semantic Web was made through incremental changes, by bringing machine-
readable descriptions to the data and documents already on the Web. Figure 1 illustrates
the various developed technologies that made the concept of the Semantic Web

possible. As already stated, the Web was originally a vast set of static Web pages linked
together. Many organizations still use static HTML files to deliver their information on
the Web. However, to answer to the inherent dynamic nature of businesses,
organizations are using dynamic publishing methods which offer great advantages over
Web sites constructed from static HTML pages. Instead of a Web site comprising a
collection of manually constructed HTML pages, server-side applications and database
access techniques are used to dynamically create Web pages directly in response to
requests from user browsers. This technique offers the opportunity to deliver Web
content that is highly customized to the needs of individual users.
Nevertheless, the technologies available to dynamically create Web pages based on
database information were insufficient for the requirements of organizations looking for
application integration solutions. Businesses required their heterogeneous systems and
applications to communicate in a transactional manner. The Extensible Markup
Language (XML 2005) was one of most successful solutions developed to provide
business-to-business integration. XML became a means of transmitting unstructured,
semi-structured, and even structured data between systems, enhancing the integration of
applications and businesses.
Figure 1. Evolution of the Web
Unfortunately, XML-based solutions for applications and systems integration were
not sufficient, since the data exchanged lacked an explicit description of its meaning.
The integration of applications must also include a semantic integration. Semantic
integration and interoperability is concerned with the use of explicit semantic
descriptions to facilitate integration.
Currently the Web is undergoing evolution (as illustrated in Figure 2) and different
approaches are being sought for solutions to adding semantics to Web resources. On the
left side of Figure 2, a graph representation of the syntactic Web is given. Resources are
linked together forming the Web. There is no distinction between resources or the links
that connect resources. To give meaning to resources and links, new standards and
languages are being investigated and developed. The rules and descriptive information
made available by these languages allow the type of resources on the Web and the
relationships between resources to be characterized individually and precisely, as
illustrated on the right side of Figure 2.

Figure 2. Evolution of the Web
Due to the widespread importance of integration and interoperability for intra- and
inter-business processes, the research community has tackled this problem and
developed semantic standards such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
(RDF 2002) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) (OWL 2004). RDF and OWL
standards enable the Web to be a global infrastructure for sharing both documents and
data, which make searching and reusing information easier and more reliable as well.
RDF is a standard for creating descriptions of information, especially information
available on the World Wide Web. What XML is for syntax, RDF is for semantics. The
latter provides a clear set of rules for providing simple descriptive information. OWL
provides a language for defining structured Web-based ontologies which allows a richer
integration and interoperability of data among communities and domains.
2 The Visual and Syntactic Web
The World Wide Web composed of HTML documents can be characterized as a visual
Web since documents are meant only to be displayed by Web browsers. In the visual
Web, machines cannot understand the meaning of the information present in HTML
pages, since they are mainly made up of ASCII codes and images. The visual Web
prevents computers from automating information processing, integration, and
interoperability.
With HTML documents, presentational metadata is used to assign information to the
content and affect its presentation. Metadata is data about data and can be used to
describe information about a resource. A resource can, for example, be a Web page, a
document, an image, or a file. Examples of metadata that can be associated with a file
include its title, subject, author, and size. Metadata mostly consists of a set of attribute
value pairs that gives information about characteristics of a document. For example,
title = Semantic Web: Technologies and Applications
subject = Semantic Web
author = Jorge Cardoso
size = 336 Kbytes
In HTML pages, the content is marked-up with metadata. Specific tags are used to
indicate the beginning and end of each element. For example, to specify that the title of
the Web page is “Semantic Web: Technologies and Applications”, the text is marked-up
using the tag . To inform the Web browser that “Motivation for the Semantic
Web” is a heading, the text is marked-up as a heading element, using level-one 
heading tag such as:
 Semantic Web: Technologies and Applications 
 Motivation for the Semantic Web

One restriction of HTML is that it is semantically limited. There is a lack of rich
vocabulary of element types capable of capturing the meaning behind every piece of
text. For example, Google search engine reads a significant number of the world’s Web
pages and allows users to type in keywords to find pages containing those
keywords. There is no meaning associated to the keywords. Google only carries out
simple matches between the keywords and the words in its database. The metadata of
HTML is not considered when searching for a particular set of keywords. Even if
Google would use HTML metadata to answer queries, the lack of semantics of HTML
tags would most likely not improve the search.
On the other hand, the Syntactic Web is the collection of documents in the World
Wide Web that contain data not just meant to be rendered by Web browsers, but also to
be used for data integration and interoperability purposes. To be able to “understand”
data, a computer needs metadata which will be provided by some kind of markup
language. A widespread markup language is XML. With HTML the set of tags available
to users is predefined and new tags cannot be added to the language. In contrast, XML
is an extremely versatile markup language allowing users to be capable of creating new
tags to add syntactic meaning to information.
In order to allow data integration, the meaning of XML document content is
determined by agreements reached between the businesses that will be exchanging data.
Agreements are usually defined using a standardized document, such as the Document
Type Definition (DTD) (XML 2005) or the XML Schema Definition (XSD)
(XMLSchema 2005) that specifies the structure and data elements of the messages
exchanged. These agreements can then be used by applications to act on the data.
In a typical organization, business data is stored in many formats and across many
systems and databases throughout the organization and with partner organizations. To
partially solve integration problems, organizations have been using solutions such as
XML to exchange or move business data between information systems. Prior to XML,
an organization had to hardcode modules to retrieve data from data sources and
construct a message to send to other applications. The adoption of XML accelerates the
construction of systems that integrate distributed, heterogeneous data. The XML
language allows the flexible coding and display of data, by using metadata to describe
the structure of data (e.g. DTD or XSD).
The first step necessary to accomplish data integration using XML technologies
consists of taking the raw data sources (text, spreadsheets, relational tables, etc) and
converting them into well-formed XML documents. The next step is to analyze and
document its structure by creating a DTD or XSD for each of the data sources.
One limitation of XML is that it can only define the syntax of documents. XML data
does not include information which can be used to describe the meaning of the tags
used. The following example illustrates an XML instance.
 John Hall 
 669-33-2555 
 Philosophy 
In this example, the XML instance indicates there is a student named “John Hall”.
His  is “669-33-2555”, but no information is provided about the meaning of an
 or the meaning of the different fields that compose an . Finally, the student’s
 is “Philosophy”. No information is provided concerning the relationship of this
 with the other majors that are given at the University John attends.

3 Unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data
Data breaks down into three broad categories (Figure 3): unstructured, semi-structured,
and structured. Highly unstructured data comprises free-form documents or objects of
arbitrary sizes and types. At the other end of the spectrum, structured data is what is
typically found in databases. Every element of data has an assigned format and
significance.

Figure 3. Unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data
3.1 Unstructured data
Unstructured data is what we find in text, files, video, emails, reports, PowerPoint
presentations, voice mail, office memos, and images. Data can be of any type and does
not necessarily follow any format, rules, or sequence. For example, the data present on
HTML Web pages is unstructured and irregular.
Unstructured data does not readily fit into structured databases except as binary large
objects (BLOBs – Binary Large Objects). Although unstructured data can have some
structure – e.g. e-mails have addressees, subjects, bodies, etc. and HTML Web pages
have a set of predefined tags – the information is not stored in such a way that it will
allow for easy classification, as the data is entered in electronic form.
3.2 Semi-structured data
Semi-structured data lies somewhere in between unstructured and structured data. Semi-
structured data is data that has some structure, but is not rigidly structured. This type of
data includes unstructured components arranged according to some pre-determined
structure. Semi-structured data can be specified in such a way that it can be queried
using general-purpose mechanisms.
