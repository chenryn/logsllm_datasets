User: Is there a configuration file where I can set its default working directory? It currently defaults to my home directory, but I want to set it to another directory when it starts. I know I can do "import os" followed by "os.chdir("")" but that's kind of troublesome. It'd be great if there is a conf file that I can edit and change that setting, but I am unable to find it.
In particular, I've looked into my OS (Ubuntu)'s desktop entry '/usr/share/applications/idle-python3.2.desktop', which doesn't contain a conf file, but points to '/usr/lib/python3.2/idlelib/PyShell.py', which points to config-*.def conf files under the same folder, with 'config-main.def' being the most likely candidate. However I am unable to find where the default path is specified or how it can be changed.
It seems that the path is hard-coded in PyShell.py, though I could be wrong with my  limited knowledge on Python. I will keep looking, but would appreciate it if somebody knows the answer on top of his or her head. Thanks in advance.
Assistant: This ought to be the number one answer.  I have been playing around this for an hour or more and nothing worked.  Paul explains this perfectly.  It's just like the PATH statement in Windows.  I successfully imported a module by appending my personal "PythonModules" path/dir on my Mac (starting at "/users/etc") using a simple 
import xxxx command in Idle.
