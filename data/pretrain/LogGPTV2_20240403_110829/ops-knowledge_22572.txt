Question: A company's cybersecurity policy mandates the use of HTTPS for all its web applications. During a routine security assessment, you discover that an internal application is using a TLS certificate signed by the company's internal CA, which is not included in your system's list of trusted CAs. The application is only accessible within the company's network. What should your next step be regarding the certificate?
"A": "Mark the certificate as untrusted because it is not signed by a public CA.",
"B": "Accept the certificate as valid because it is signed by the company's internal CA and the application is for internal use.",
"C": "Recommend replacing the internal CA-signed certificate with a self-signed certificate for better security.",
"D": "Advise the company to discontinue using TLS as it is susceptible to implementation vulnerabilities."
Answer: B
