I need to check if a Python script is running with administrative permissions on Windows, without using the `ctypes` module. I have some specific reasons for avoiding `ctypes`.

I have not found a solution yet.

Thank you.

**Response:**

You can achieve this by installing the `pywin32` library, which provides a function to check if the current user is a member of the administrators group. Specifically, you can use the `win32api.IsUserAnAdmin()` function from the `pywin32` package.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `pywin32` library if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   pip install pywin32
   ```

2. Use the following code in your script:
   ```python
   import win32api

   if win32api.IsUserAnAdmin():
       print("The script is running with administrative permissions.")
   else:
       print("The script is not running with administrative permissions.")
   ```

This approach will help you determine if the script has the necessary permissions without relying on the `ctypes` module.
