Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness
We were unable to review your app as it crashed on launch on Mac running macOS
10.15.3. We have attached detailed crash logs to help troubleshoot this issue.
Next Steps
To resolve this issue, please revise your app and test it on a device to
ensure it will launch without crashing.

Note TN2151 Understanding and Analyzing Application Crash Reports.
Guideline 2.5.1 - Performance - Software Requirements
Your app uses or references the following non-public APIs:
Symbols: _vDSP_deq22D, _vDSP_vsma
The use of non-public APIs is not permitted on the App Store, because it can
lead to a poor user experience should these APIs change.
We are constantly reevaluating and identifying non-public APIs that you may
have been using for an extended period of time. You should always use public
APIs and frameworks and ensure they are up-to-date to prevent this issue in
the future.
Next Steps
If you are using third-party libraries, please update to the most recent
version of those libraries. If you do not have access to the libraries'
source, you may be able to search the compiled binary using the "strings" or
"otool" command line tools. The "strings" tool can output a list of the
methods that the library calls and "otool -ov" will output the Objective-C
class structures and their defined methods. These tools can help you narrow
down where the problematic code resides.
Continuing to use or conceal non-public APIs in future submissions of this app
may result in the termination of your Apple Developer account, as well as
removal of all associated apps from the App Store.
Resources
If there are no alternatives for providing the functionality your app
requires, you can use Feedback Assistant to submit an enhancement request.
If you are unable to reproduce this issue, ensure you are testing the exact
version of the app that you submitted for review, and that you're doing so in
a minimally privileged environment. See Technical Q&A QA1778: How to reproduce
bugs reported against Mac App Store submissions.
