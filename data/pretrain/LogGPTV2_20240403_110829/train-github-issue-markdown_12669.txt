When rapidly erasing lines from a scrolling text box, the text that should be
hidden due to it being outside of the box incorrectly appears.
To reproduce:
  1. Open Flutter gallery
  2. Select "Material"
  3. Select "Text Fields"
  4. Type many lines of short text in the "Life story" section (at least 6, the more the better)
  5. Rapidly erase the lines. The first few hidden lines will appear as the text scrolls up.
