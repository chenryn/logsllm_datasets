I have been trying to use a full ES6 webpack configuration file using Babel 6
but it seems that `export default` if in fact not exporting anything.
I named my config file webpack.config.babel.js and this is the code:
    import path from 'path';
    import HtmlwebpackPlugin from 'html-webpack-plugin';
    const ROOT_PATH = path.resolve(__dirname);
    const APP_PATH = path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'app');
    const BUILD_PATH = path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, 'build');
    export default {
      entry: APP_PATH,
      output: {
        path: BUILD_PATH,
        filename: 'bundle.js'
      },
      plugins: [
        new HtmlwebpackPlugin({
          title: 'React Kanban App'
        })
      ]
    };
Every time I run webpack I just get the webpack options list and a message
saying `Output filename not configured.`, but If I change the expression to
`module.exports = { ... }` everything works fine.
My `.babelrc` file is like this:
    {
      "presets": [
        "es2015",
        "react"
      ]
    }
And my dependencies are:
    "devDependencies": {
        "babel-core": "^6.1.21",
        "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.1.18",
        "babel-preset-react": "^6.1.18",
        "webpack": "^1.12.6"
      }
I can't figure out what is going on here, is this a bug?
