# Evaluation of Anti-Spyware Applications for Detecting and Preventing Intimate Partner Surveillance (IPS)

## 1. Introduction

This study evaluates the effectiveness of various anti-spyware applications in detecting and preventing spyware used in intimate partner surveillance (IPS). We focus on both on-store and off-store apps, as well as their false positive rates. The results are summarized in Figure 6, which shows the true positive and false positive detection rates of these apps.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Collection
We collected a total of 40 anti-spyware applications, including popular antivirus providers and top search results from the Google Play Store for "anti-spyware." We also included 280 on-store apps and 23 off-store apps suspected of being dual-use or spyware. Additionally, we tested 100 top-selling benign apps to measure false positive rates.

### 2.2 Testing Procedure
For each anti-spyware app, we followed these steps:
1. Installed the app.
2. Allowed it to complete its scan of the device.
3. Recorded the results.
4. Uninstalled the anti-spyware app.

The output format varied among the anti-spyware apps, often requiring manual transcription of results. Some apps provided binary classifications, while others offered more granular categories. For example, Norton Antivirus categorizes apps as "ok," "malware," "medium privacy risk," and "high privacy risk." Any app not marked as "ok" was considered flagged as spyware.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 True Positive and False Positive Rates
Figure 6 presents the true positive (third and fourth columns) and false positive (final column) detection rates of the anti-spyware apps. The apps are ordered by the number of reported downloads (second column).

- **True Positives**: Most anti-spyware apps were ineffective against dual-use apps, flagging at most 3% of them. However, they performed better with off-store spyware, with many flagging over 70%.
- **False Positives**: Apps that detected more spyware had higher false positive rates. For instance, Anti Spy Mobile flagged more than 47% of on-store IPS-relevant apps but also incorrectly flagged Chrome, Play Store, and Amazon apps as risky.

### 3.2 Virustotal Analysis
Virustotal, an aggregator of over 60 antivirus engines, was also evaluated. Figure 7 shows the fraction of off-store spyware, on-store spyware, and top-100 benign apps detected by the indicated number of AV engines.

- **On-Store Apps**: Only 21 out of 280 on-store dual-use apps (8%) were flagged by at least three AV engines.
- **Off-Store Apps**: Cyren and WhiteArmor were the best performers. Cyren flagged 6% of on-store IPS apps and 70% of off-store spyware but had one false positive. WhiteArmor flagged 5% of on-store apps, all off-store spyware, and had no false positives.

## 4. Discussion: Dealing with IPS Spyware

### 4.1 Improved Detection and Removal
To combat IPS apps, we propose:
- **Enhanced Detection Tools**: Building upon our measurement framework to create a proof-of-concept blacklisting tool.
- **Ongoing App Collection and Labeling**: Ensuring robustness against evasion attacks and malicious developers.
- **Vendor Collaboration**: Encouraging antivirus vendors to extend their tools to detect IPS spyware and dual-use apps.

### 4.2 OS Notifications and Protections
- **Enforcing Policies**: Mobile OS developers should enforce policies to prevent apps from working in the background without proper notification.
- **User Awareness**: Regularly informing users if sensitive data is being synced with remote servers.
- **Balancing Needs**: Carefully designing mechanisms to balance legitimate use with the threat of misuse.

### 4.3 Preventing IPS Use Cases
- **Advertising Networks**: Stopping ads for search terms related to IPS.
- **Search Engine Preferences**: Prioritizing legal information in response to abuse-related queries.
- **Law Enforcement**: Escalating enforcement against products intended for illegal use.
- **App Design Guidelines**: Making parental control and SMS syncing apps less attractive for IPS use cases.

## 5. Conclusion

Our study provides the first in-depth measurement of the ecosystem of software used for IPS on mobile devices. We found that existing anti-spyware tools are insufficient for detecting dual-use apps. There is an urgent need for improved detection tools, OS-level protections, and collaborative efforts to prevent the misuse of dual-use apps. Our findings have already led to actions by Google to improve user safety, and we hope this work will inspire further research and advocacy to enhance digital security for those affected by IPV.
