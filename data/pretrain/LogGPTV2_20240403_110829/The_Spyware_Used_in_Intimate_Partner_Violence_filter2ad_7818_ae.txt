apps we collected outside the Google Play store. Again the
remaining three could not be installed due to compatibility
issues. Finally to measure false positive rates, we installed the
100 top-selling apps (in November 2017) from Google Play
that are not usable as spyware (manually veriﬁed).
For each anti-spyware app, we ﬁrst install the app, allow
it to complete its scan of the device, record its results, and
then uninstall the anti-spyware app. The output format from
the anti-spyware apps varies and often does not provide a
report that can be exported programmatically, so we manually
transcribe the results. Some anti-spyware apps give binary
classiﬁcation, while others provide multiple types of classi-
ﬁcations. For example, Norton Anti-Virus categorizes apps as
“ok”, “malware”, “medium privacy risk”, and “high privacy
risk”. Whenever an app offered classiﬁcation more granular
than binary, we counted anything not marked “ok” as being
ﬂagged as spyware.
Evaluation. Of the 40 anti-spyware apps, 37 are completely
ineffective against dual-use apps, ﬂagging at most 3% of them.
Most of the anti-spyware apps ﬂag more than 70% of the
off-store spyware apps. The performance results of the anti-
spyware apps are given in Figure 6.
The ones that detect the most spyware have higher false
positive rates. For example, Anti Spy Mobile catches more
than 47% of on-store IPS-relevant apps, but ﬂags Chrome,
Play Store, and Amazon apps as risky. Further investigation
revealed that these anti-spyware apps simply mark any app
that uses certain permissions as risky.

Fig. 7: Fraction of off-store spyware, on-store spyware, and
top-100 apps (benign, non-spyware apps) detected by the
indicated number of AV engines available in Virustotal.
All but one of the top-brand anti-virus providers (e.g., Avast,
AVG, Avira, ESET, McAfee, and Kaspersky) detect less than
3% of dual-use apps. Presumably this reﬂects their design
goals, which do not necessarily include detecting IPS spyware,
let alone dual-use apps. Indeed in non-IPV contexts marking
some of the dual-use apps as malicious would represent false
positives to their users.
B. Virustotal Analysis
We also evaluate whether Virustotal [57], an aggregator of
many anti-virus engines, can be used to identify IPS apps.
Virustotal hosts more than 60 anti-virus engines (AV engines),
and a large number of tools for static and dynamic analysis
of content. Access to the Virustotal API is free for non-
commercial use and takes as input an MD5 or SHA1 hash
of an app’s binary.
We had Virustotal evaluate the 280 on-store apps identiﬁed
in Section III-B as well as the 23 off-store apps. Figure 7 gives
the fraction of on-store and off-store IPS apps and the top 100
benign apps ﬂagged by at least the indicated number of AV
engines. As one datapoint, only 21 apps out of 280 on-store
dual-use apps (8%) were ﬂagged by at least three AV engines.
The best two AV engines were Cyren and WhiteArmor. Cyren
ﬂagged 6% of the on-store IPS apps, and 70% of the off-
store spyware, but Cyren also ﬂagged one of the top 100 apps
(Pandora Radio). WhiteArmor ﬂagged less dual-use apps than
Cyren (only 5%), but ﬂagged all of the off-store spyware, and
did not have any false positives. In the end, we conclude that
these engines are not designed to catch dual-use apps, their
focus instead being on other forms of malware.
VII. DISCUSSION: DEALING WITH IPS SPYWARE
Spyware used in IPV settings endangers the safety and
privacy of survivors. As our measurements suggest, spyware
takes on many forms, ranging from apps overtly designed
and advertised for IPS to dual-use tools with functionalities
easily repurposed for IPS. Existing anti-spyware tools do not
sufﬁciently detect dual-use apps.
Thus, we propose a multi-pronged strategy for combating
IPS apps and improving safety for survivors. A full investiga-

tion of our suggestions will require signiﬁcant future work —
here we outline ideas and discuss looming hurdles.
Improved detection and removal. An urgently needed ﬁrst
step is to improve detection of IPS apps. We envision building
upon our measurement framework from Section III-B to con-
struct a proof-of-concept blacklisting tool capable of detecting
potential IPS apps. Apps need to be collected and labeled on
an ongoing basis. An issue to be dealt with is ensuring the
robustness of our crawling and detection infrastructure in the
face of malicious developers seeking to avoid classiﬁcation as
spyware. For example, our ML classiﬁer may be vulnerable
to evasion attacks [36,41,42]. We hope that anti-virus vendors
will extend their commercial tools to deal with IPS spyware
and dual-use apps, perhaps using our techniques.
The deployment of detection and removal tools faces par-
ticular challenges in the IPV context, as using anti-spyware
or removing IPS apps may risk escalation from digital abuse
to physical violence (see [29,30,46]). This means deployment
may require multiple modalities, such as a covert or easily-
removed anti-spyware app, or even use of a USB-connected
laptop at shelters (or other places that victims may go to obtain
help) to scan the device. New guidelines for safety planning
when IPS apps are found will be needed, as removing them
may be too dangerous in the short term.
OS notiﬁcations and protections. We found many IPS apps,
including on-store apps, work in the background without
proper notiﬁcation — even when sensitive data (i.e., camera,
microphone, chat messages, photos) is being relayed. Two IPS
apps also hide their icon in the app drawer. Though Google
Play’s developer policy explicitly prohibits this [1], there is no
OS-level enforcement.
We propose that mobile OS developers strengthen user
protections by enforcing the policies in their developer agree-
ments. Bundled dual-use apps, such as Google Maps or iCloud
should take special steps to regularly inform the user if they
are syncing any sensitive data with a remote server. Future
work would be needed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of speciﬁc
notiﬁcation policies, as users do not always notice indicators
like “recording lights” [27, 51]. OS-level protections would
need to be carefully designed, so as not to be bypassable, at
least should the device not be rooted (c.f., [15]). Finally, and
most critically, these mechanisms would need to be carefully
constructed to balance the needs of legitimate applications of
dual-use apps with the threat of their use as spyware.
IPS use case prevention. Our measurements revealed that
dual-use apps are often advertised for IPS, both in paid
advertising channels and in organic marketing (e.g., blog posts
and search results). Some developers explicitly condone IPS,
while in other cases they do little to prevent it. We believe ad
networks, OS vendors, and developers can work together to
better prevent use of legitimate dual-use apps for IPS.
As a start, advertising networks should stop accepting paid
ads for search terms related to IPS/IPV. There is precedence
for this in other contexts, such as prescription drug advertis-
ing [55]. In response to this paper, Google has already stopped
showing advertisements on IPS-related search terms. Search
engines could also potentially preference information about
legality in response to abuse-related queries, hopefully creating
a deterrent for an abuser. Organic marketing will be difﬁcult to
curb from a technology perspective, but here law enforcement
agencies, such as the FTC and DOJ in the United States,
might escalate their enforcement of policies against products
intended for illegal use, such as in the CyberSpy case [20,47].
Future work could develop guidelines for building apps
which are less attractive for IPS use cases. As an example,
parental control apps need not be surreptitious, so they could
be made conspicuous. Similarly, SMS syncing apps should
always show clear notiﬁcations when forwarding to another
device, as done by some messenger apps already [31]. Finally,
developers could better monitor comments and reviews, and
refuse to continue service to people indicating an IPS usage.
For example, TeenSafe’s customer service refused to help us
when we indicated we intended to use their app for IPS.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper we provided the ﬁrst in-depth measurement
study of the ecosystem of software used for IPS on mobile
devices. Taking the view of an abuser, we used manual
the abundant
as well as automated crawling to document
resources currently available to abusers,
including how-to
guides, question-and-answer forums, and apps. Over a one
month period, we crawled the Google Play Store and used
a combination of manual review and machine learning to
discover a large amount of dual-use apps: those designed
for some legitimate use, but which are being repurposed by
abusers for IPS. By investigating advertising behavior, online
forum discussions, and customer service responses, we showed
that many dual-use app vendors are tacitly facilitating or,
in some cases, condoning IPS. We measured the efﬁcacy of
existing anti-spyware tools and found them insufﬁcient for use
in IPV contexts.
Given that abusers use IPS apps to cause emotional and
physical harm, including even murder, there is an acute need
for the security community to help mitigate the threat. In
response to our paper, Google improved safety for their users
by taking action against apps that violated Play Store policies.
They have also increased restrictions on advertisement serving
for IPV-related queries. More broadly, we have initiated dis-
cussion about future work ranging from improved detection
tools to legal and regulatory improvements. We hope future
research and advocacy will further increase digital security
and safety for those suffering in IPV situations.
