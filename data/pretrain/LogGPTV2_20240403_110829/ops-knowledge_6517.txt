User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题zfs - two pools with nested mountpoints and conflicting mount order I have a problem with automounting separate pools, that have nested mountpoints. I am using ZfsOnLinux 0.6.2.

The siuation currently is as follows:

zpool1      ---&gt; /var
zpool1/log  ---&gt; /var/log
zpool1/mail ---&gt; /var/mail


Now I need to add a separate zpool for db. To keep directory hierarchy consistent, I thought about this:

zpool2      ---&gt; /var/db


Now, the problem is that when zpool2 is mounted first, zpool1 fails to mount (this is logical).

Is there a way I can force the mount order of pools to allow mounting of zpool2 inside zpool1, besides using the legacy mount option? Something like zpools dependency? Or should I avoid such nested mounts at all costs?

Assistant: Instead of mounting zpool2 as /var/db, mount it as /zpool2 or /db or whatever makes sense for you.

Then make /var/db a symlink to /db.
