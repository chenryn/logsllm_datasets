User: I'll like to create a python flask application that can run on any platform. I've put it in a Docker container. But unless I've misunderstood something the host machine still need docker installed to launch the container. Which in turn required Vagrant and and Ubuntu VM (at least on Mac). Am I missing something? What is the correct way to use a container as a standalone application?
Assistant: A Linux VM is a dependency if you are on Windows or Mac. Vagrant is not though. It is mentioned only because it's probably the easiest way to get a VM up and running.
