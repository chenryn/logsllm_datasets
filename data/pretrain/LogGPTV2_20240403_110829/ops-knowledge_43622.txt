User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache other_vhosts_access.log and access.log log files Got a weird issue with the apache access logs.
I am getting an entry for the site written to 

/var/log/apache2/access.log


AND

/var/log/apache2/other_vhosts/access.log


I am using Debian 6, with the latest Apache in the repo.
When I look at the file

/etc/apache2/conf.d/other-vhosts-access-log


It says

# Define an access log for VirtualHosts that don't define their own logfile
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/other_vhosts_access.log vhost_combined


but when I look in my VirtualHost declaration for the site, it has

    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log vhost_combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


at the bottom of the file.
So I have declared the log file, so why does apache still write an entry to the other_vhosts_access.log?

In the end, I commented out the line in the apache/conf.d file, but doesn't feel like it's the best way.

What am I missing?

Assistant: Without seeing the full apache configuration this is difficult to diagnose but some things to look at


Check that you're not including or defining a second log file within the same vhost - this will cause double logging.
Check that the log files aren't linked to each other - find /var/log/apache2 -samefile /var/log/apache2/access.log will list them both if this is true.


Consider the possibility that this is a bug.
