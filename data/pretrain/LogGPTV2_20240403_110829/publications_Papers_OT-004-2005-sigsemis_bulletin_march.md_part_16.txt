4th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2005)
6th - 10th November 2005
Galway, Ireland
Supported by the Semantic Web Science Association in cooperation with the Knowledge Web and DARPA.
ISWC is a major international forum where visionary and state-of-the-art research of all aspects of the
Semantic Web are presented. ISWC2005 follows the 1st International Semantic Web Conference
(ISWC2002 which was held in Sardinia, Italy, 9-12 June 2002), the 2nd International Semantic Web
Conference (ISWC2003 which was held in Florida, USA, 20 - 23 October 2003) and 3rd International
Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2004 which was held in Hiroshima, Japan, 7 - 11 November 2004).
ISWC2005 will be held in Galway, Ireland 6- 10 November 2005.
Call for Research Papers
Fourth International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2005)
November 6 –10, 2005
Radisson SAS Hotel
Galway, Ireland
http://iswc2005.semanticweb.org
Building on the current architecture for the World Wide Web, Semantic Web technologies provide a wide
range of tools and techniques to support automated reasoning over distributed representations of Web
content. The Semantic Web will enable a new generation of applications for education, business, science,
and consumer services. It will inspire novel tools for general collaboration and research. The Semantic
Web presents an unprecedented challenge of scale and heterogeneity to existing work in expressive
representation and query languages, reasoning engines, data representation and integration,
interoperability middleware, and distributed computing. To foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration,
the International Semantic Web Conference brings together researchers in relevant disciplines such as
artificial intelligence, databases, distributed computing, and information systems.
The Fourth International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2005) follows on the success of previous
conferences and workshops in Hiroshima, Japan (2004), Sanibel Island, USA (2003), Sardinia, Italy
(2002), and Stanford, USA (2001).
In addition to this call for papers for the research track, ISWC 2005 will include an industrial track, a
poster and demonstration track, and a special competition known as the Semantic Web Challenge. The
calls for those tracks can be found on the ISWC 2005 Web site, http://iswc2005.semanticweb.org.
The research track of ISWC2005 solicits the submission of original, principled research papers dealing with
both analytical and practical aspects of semantic Web research. Topics include, but are not limited to:
• Applications of Semantic Web technologies with clear lessons learned
• Semantic Web for e-business, e-science, e-government, and e-learning
• User-centered applications of the Semantic Web
• Languages, tools and methodologies for representing and managing Semantic Web data
• Robust and scalable knowledge management and reasoning on the Web
• Ontology creation, extraction, and evolution
• Ontology mapping, merging, and alignment
• Database technologies for the Semantic Web
• Semantic Web middleware
• Machine learning and human language technologies for the Semantic Web
• Semantic Web services
• Agents on the Web
• Representing and reasoning about trust, privacy, and security
• Semantic web technology for collaboration and cooperation

Workshop Background and Objectives:
So far, e-business models and the deployment of respective e-business applications have not been as
successful as widely expected, with e-marketplaces and e-procurement being prominent examples. It can be
observed that one major obstacle is the insufficient degree of reliable mechanization in the exchange and
integration of product-related content between business partners. For both suppliers and buyers, product-
related data is the foundation for a multiplicity of processes along the life-cycle of a product, ranging from
product design and construction to sales and procurement, and ending with the proper disposal.
Traditionally, product data mostly resides in intra-organizational systems, especially ERP, product data
management (PDM), and, more recently, product life-cycle management (PLM) systems. The exchange of such
data is widely organized in bulk data transfer cycles, often requiring manual tasks at both ends. This is costly,
creates inconsistent data due to human error and delayed processing, limits the timely availability of current
data for decision making, and in general hampers the success of inter-organizational business integration.
While there has been a lot of research on the ontological aspects of product data as well as on the importance
of industry standards, a comprehensive and consensual understanding of the problem domain and its
multiple facets is still lacking among information systems researchers, computer scientists, and domain
experts. There are numerous important issues that have to be explored regarding the modeling, integration,
harmonization and standardization of product-related data, both on an intra- and interorganiza-tional scale, as
well as in terms of design, implementation, integration, deployment and assessment of respective information
systems. Further progress in this field will be necessary to help manage the exchange, integration, and
processing of such data in an automated manner between multiple different business entities and systems.
This workshop aims at providing a forum for researchers and practitioners in this field for both research in
progress and final results with regard to innovative approaches, models, concepts, and solutions that address
the key role of product-related data in information systems.
We especially invite contributions that help integrate the multiple research communities in information
systems and knowledge representa-tion, and product domain experts. We also seek papers on the current state
and possible further directions of product-related standards on all levels of standardization.
Possible topics include, but are not limited to:
 Product-related content integration in
e-business
 Product data quality and interoperability
 Modeling, design, maintenance, and versioning of product-related data
 Product ontologies and ontological aspects of product-related data
 Standards for product classification and description
 Product data and product life-cycle management
 Product dictionaries and properties
 Cases and tools for managing product-related data
