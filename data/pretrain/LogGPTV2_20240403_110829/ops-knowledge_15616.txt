when there is an error in the code the page the browsers shows nothing and browser says there is no source for the page.
Any suggestions of where else to look or change to errors to appear somewhere (anywhere would be good)

edit: my error script is now

&lt;?php
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
error_reporting(E_ALL);
echo "print from error.php 2 ";
error                        
//print from erroerror to cuase logging to happen.
?&gt;


this will print on display and to log 

Notice: Use of undefined constant error - assumed 'error' in /var/www/piku_dev2/error.php on line 7


but if I put garbage like   #@$%$ on the error line I get nor error messages anywhere.

Edit2:
The problem turned out to in the httpd.conf file.  I don't know what it was yet as it was fixed y someone else.

Assistant: I can see a few possible solutions to your problem. These are the most common issues you'll run into:


In your example, you use #@$%$ to induce an error. However, PHP treats any line beginning with a hash as a comment, so this line would never be evaluated, hence it would never trigger an error condition.
There are 2 distinct php.ini files that you should be aware of; one for Apache and one for the PHP CLI. Make sure that the one you've edited is the one for Apache if your script is being called from a web browser. The directory that this file is found in will vary from distro to distro, but the default path is usually a slight variation of /etc/php/apache/php.ini
You must restart Apache after making changes to the php.ini file, or send a SIGHUP to Apache to force a re-read of the configuration file. 
The error_reporting and log_errors configuration variables can be overwritten locally within an Apache vhost file, or even in the PHP script itself. Make sure that the default server config does not overwrite these variables locally in the Apache configuration for the vhost you're using.
The permissions of your /var/log/php.log file need to be writeable by Apache. It's usually safe to set the owner of this file to the Apache user on your system (the Apache user is usually either www-data or apache).
