To sign in or out of OpenERP 7, users need to log in to the system and click on the icon located at the top right corner, next to the "Compose New Message" button. However, many users often forget to sign out. Is there a way to automatically sign out users when the system is shut down, similar to how a Windows service operates? 

In response to your query, it is important to note that HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means that once a client (in this case, the user's browser) has made a request, the server processes it, and the transaction is complete. The server does not maintain any persistent state for the client. When you shut down the OpenERP server and then restart it, all active sessions are invalidated, and clients will be redirected to the login page upon their next request.

While it is technically possible to implement an automatic sign-out feature, it may not be necessary due to the nature of the HTTP protocol. When the server is shut down, all sessions are effectively terminated, and users will be required to log in again when they next access the system.

However, if you still wish to ensure that users are signed out when their local system is shut down, you could consider implementing a script or service on the client side that sends a sign-out request to the OpenERP server before the system shuts down. This would require some custom development and might involve creating a small application or script that runs as a background process on each user's machine.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with implementing such a solution, please let me know.
