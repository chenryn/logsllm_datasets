User: How to modify the default DNS server in Linux system?
Assistant: To modify the default DNS server on a Linux system, follow these steps: 1. Open the /etc/resolv.conf file: ``` sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf ``` 2. Find the "nameserver" line and add Below that line add the IP address of the new DNS server you want to use. For example, if you want to use Google's DNS server, you can add the following line to the file: ``` nameserver 8.8.8.8 ``` 3. You can add a second alternate DNS server. For example: ``` nameserver 8.8.8.8 nameserver 8.8.4.4 ``` 4. Save and close the file. 5. Check whether the configuration takes effect: ``` cat /etc/resolv.conf ``` Confirm that the IP address of the new DNS server is displayed in the nameserver line. Please note that if the system is using Network Manager to manage network connections, do not manually edit this file, because the network manager should automatically update the file. DNS servers should be configured by editing the settings of Network Manager.
