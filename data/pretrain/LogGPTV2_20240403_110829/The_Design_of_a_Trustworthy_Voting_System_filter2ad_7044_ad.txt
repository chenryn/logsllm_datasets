run  malicious  code  on  an  attested  voting  machine.  If  veri-
fication succeeds while violating our attestation assumptions, 
election  integrity  is  not  compromised,  because  the  voting 
machine will issue human-verifiable paper ballots that can be 
easily checked by the voter. 
     The on-screen directions tell the voter to swipe the voting 
token with the reader as shown in Fig. 3. The computer then 
looks up the voter record for VIDi, computes hash (Si1 || Si2) , 
and  compares  it  to  the  value  stored  in  the  record.  A  match 
means  two  things.  First,  the  voter  got  the  card  at  home 
(assuming no one intercepted Si1 from the registrar to the post 
office to the voter), thus at least has access to the mailbox at 
the address given at registration time (to get Si1). Second, that 
the  poll  worker  authenticated  the  voter  and  gave  Si2  (i.e., 
voter did not just sneak in the back door). 
    Next, the voter is asked to enter his password. The hashed 
password value is compared to the stored hashed value in the 
voter’s record. If they match, the voter is approved and may 
vote.  If  they  do  not  match,  the  voter  can  try  again  up  to  k 
times  before  being  locked  out.  In  addition  to  Si1  and  Si2 
(something you have), the password (something you know) is 
the second line of defense. Without all three values (Si1, Si2, 
and the password), no one can  vote electronically and  must 
use  a  provisional  ballot.  This  is  the  only  part  of  the  voting 
system  that  requires  a  change  in  the  voting  process,  but  a 
password  that  the  voter  may  write  down  should  not  pose  a 
large difficulty. 
     Now  the  voter  is  presented  with  the  various  races

(President, Governor, etc.) one at a time and is given the op-
portunity to select a candidate for each one. Here is where the 
multilingual,  large  font,  audio,  and  other  capabilities  of  the 
machine  shine.  At  the  end,  the  machine  displays  a  screen 
showing all the choices and asks if they are correct. If not, the 
voter can make changes, thus avoiding all the problems seen 
in  the  2008  Minnesota  Senate  election  [41].  If  the  voter 
confirms that the choices are correctly recorded, the vote  is 
signed  with  an  auto-generated  signing  key,  encrypted  with 
the precinct public key, and recorded on the storage medium 
(e.g.,  CD-ROM  or  flash  memory),  and  the  smart  card  is 
overwritten  to  prevent  reuse.  There  should  be  a  table  with 
initially  blank  vote  slots  on  the  recording  medium  and  one 
chosen at random (using random numbers from the TPM) to 
prevent officials from determining after the election how the 
kth voter voted by examining slot k on the output medium. If 
a  CD-ROM  is  used,  this  might  require  reprogramming  the 
firmware slightly. 
     A  subtle  attack  exists  at  this  point.  Unlike  most  voting 
systems, the poll workers are not fully trusted in this design. 
If a poll worker were to create n identical smart cards (e.g., 
containing his own information), then the poll worker could 
use each card to cast a vote during election day. Our defense 
is simple. The voting machine will also record (to a random 
location)  a  hash  of  the  voter’s  secret,  Si.  By  having  each 
voting  machine  check  this  hash  before  casting  a  vote,  this 
limits  someone  to  casting  v  votes  for  v  different  voting 
machines.  Operational  procedures  that  prohibit  people  from 
carrying more than one smartcard around after the polls open 
can also help deter this type of attack. In any case, we view 
this  attack  to  be  unlikely.  The  attacker  has  several  con-
straints:  a  poll  worker  must  help  (or  be  the  attacker),  the 
votes  can  only  be  cast  on  election  day,  and  the  attack  must 
happen while the polling place is open. 
     To finalize the vote, the machine prints a signed human-
verifiable paper ballot for each race. Having a ballot per race 
protects against an attacker asking a voter to fill out an entire 
ballot in a  specific  manner and later show this ballot to the 
attacker. Most currently deployed voting machines use cheap 
printers  that  sometimes  jam;  we  assume  that  better  quality 
printers are in use (as on  ATMs). The voter is instructed to 
verify the ballot and put it in the ballot box under the watch-
ful gaze of the poll workers. In the event of a disputed elec-
tion,  the  paper  ballots  are  optically  scanned  or  counted  by 
hand.  These  are  the  real  votes.  The  machine  totals  are  just 
preliminary tallies to give people a rough score just after the 
polls close. With signed paper ballots, a machine cannot un-
detectably change the election results. 
     In  addition,  the  machine  uses  a  TPM-generated  random 
number  to  print  out  a  separate  piece  of  paper  for  each  race 
with  the  precinct  ID  and  a  random  value  (unique  across  all 
the votes in the precinct), the political office, and a URL on 
it. Ideally, a poll worker physically stamps the paper (a valid 
receipt must have a stamp and be signed with a key from a 
machine in the specific precinct) and the voter is told to take 
this piece of paper home. However, stamping each piece  of 
paper  may  not  be  feasible,  and  the  digital  signature  should 
suffice  (This  assumes  hiding  a  small  cryptographic  key  is 
easier  than  stopping  robbers  of  the  stamp).  The  random 
number is recorded along with the vote. 
Step 8: Tabulating the Votes. When the last voter has voted 
and  the  doors  locked,  the  head  poll  worker  goes  to  each 
machine in turn and enters a secret code to end the election. 
The  machine  then  signs  the  stored  votes  to  mark  them  as 
complete  and  also  prints  out  a  ticket  with  the  results,  all  in 
the presence of citizen and political party observers. When all 
the  votes  have  been  collected,  the  recording  media  are  put 
into a briefcase and locked. The ballot box and briefcase are 
now securely escorted to headquarters. The head poll worker 
calls  up  the  county  on  the  phone  to  report  the  preliminary 
results. It is not done electronically because that opens up too 
many new attack scenarios. 
Step 9: Publishing the Result. As soon as is practical after 
the vote-bearing storage media arrive at the county registrar 
(in the presence of the parties and citizen observers), they are 
read in on a computer whose open-source software has gone 
through  our  verification  process.  As  a  check,  the  process 
could be repeated on several computers, possibly supplied by 
different  (political)  parties,  and  combined  with  randomized 
manual recounts of a small percentage of the ballots. At this 
point  the  county  will  have  a  list  of  {random  number, 
political-office, vote} tuples for each cast vote. 
     Many paper-based schemes have been proposed to allow 
the voter to check the integrity of the election without being 
able to sell a vote [7, 8, 14, 35]. These verification designs 
are clever in their allowing the voter to verify their vote while 
keeping their vote secret. However, voters and legislators will 
have  significant  trouble  understanding  how  verification 
works and knowing their vote is actually counted. This com-
plexity  precludes  system  adoption.  Aside  from  verification 
complexity,  receipts  pose  additional  difficulties.  Although  a 
voter  may  trust  his  verifiable  receipt,  an  attacker  can  still 
compromise  an  election  in  a  way  that  does  not  break 
verification.  Although  voters  may  have  a  verifiable  receipt, 
verification presents a new capability for an attacker: forging 
bogus receipts to try to get the election thrown out. Based on 
these issues, we present a simple and transparent verification 
scheme  that  should  be  understandable  to  most  voters  and 
politicians. 
     In our verification design, the county officials can post the 
entire  list  of  voting  tuples  onto  its  website.  This  protects 
election integrity by allowing every voter to verify his or her 
own  vote.  If  county  officials  cheat  and  modify  1%  of  the 
votes  and  1000  voters  check  their  votes,  the  probability  of 
undetected  cheating  is  then  0.991000  ≈  0.004%.  While  this 
scheme  preserves  the  voter’s  privacy  (since  only  the  voter

has the random number printed after voting), voter coercion 
may become a concern (although still easily done with absen-
tee ballots). To combat voter coercion, voters can switch their 
receipt  with  someone  from  a  different  party  and  later  show 
the  “required”  vote  (similar  to  Rivest  and  Smith  [38]). 
Receipt swapping can be done with either a trusted friend or 
perhaps through a receipt-swapping website. Because a swap 
may involve a bogus receipt, both participants should verify 
signed receipts themselves or use a  friend to verify receipts 
for  them.  Unlike  floating  receipts  where  voters  must  check 
someone else’s vote [38], voters maintain the ability to check 
their own votes. We believe voters will have some motivation 
to  check  if  their  own  votes  were  recorded  but  very  little 
motivation  to  check  on  the  vote  of  some  random  unknown 
person. 
     Our  human-readable  receipt  solution  does  not  solve  the 
problem  where  challenges  to  results  can  erode  voter  confi-
dence. Performing a recount on a single challenge would be 
expensive, but ignoring a percentage of them could hurt the 
public’s trust of the voting process. If receipts are provided in 
an election, a policy that balances the voters’ trust and the ex-
pense of a recount should be established and followed.  
     A  benefit  of  our  design  is  that  people  will  easily  under-
stand  the  one-to-one  mapping  of  their  number  (or  detailed 
vote information) to the site. To get a scheme accepted, it is 
essential that politicians and voters be able to understand it. 
With this simple design, voters are motivated to check their 
receipt. If a valid receipt’s vote is displayed, they can assume 
their vote was counted. 
4.  Discussion 
     This  voting  system  allows  anyone,  in  a  simple  way,  to 
verify  the  final  tally  (sum  the  votes  at  the  receipt’s  URI) 
while providing each voter a way to verify that his own vote 
was  cast  for  his  own  candidate.  The  voter  registration 
changes  of  using  a  password  and  establishing  a  secret  that 
will be used on election day helps protect the voter’s vote. No 
one  can  cast  a  vote  without  the  necessary  voting  token  and 
password.  Election  integrity  is  preserved  by  voters  looking 
up their own votes on the election website. The cost of this 
simplified voting scheme is that vote selling is now possible 
with both electronic receipts and the much simpler absentee 
ballot route. As absentee ballots become more common [28], 
making  the  in-person  voting  system  more  complicated  in 
order  to  prevent  something  that  can  be  easily  circumvented 
with an absentee ballot is a poor tradeoff. 
      Part of the challenge of voter authentication is our use of 
passwords.  In  our  system,  passwords  defend  against  attacks 
where someone (e.g., a poll worker) records votes for regis-
tered voters that do not show up at the polling place and have 
not  voted  absentee.  There  is  no  way  for  the  poll  worker  to 
vote without knowing (or guessing) the password. The voter 
is  already  required  to  have  something  to  vote  (Si),  but  the 
password  makes  the  voter  know  a  secret  established  at 
registration.  However,  drawbacks  exist  such  as  voters  for-
getting  passwords  that  will  increase  the  number  of  provi-
sional ballots used (we initially expect this). If no voting au-
thentication mechanism is in place, poll workers can change 
election outcomes simply by voting in the place of registered 
voters that do not show up at the polling place (assuming the 
poll  workers  are  able  to  get  Si1).  Using  passwords  helps 
thwart  these  damaging  attacks.  Other  voting  schemes  are 
vulnerable to these attacks. 
     Related to the problem of verification is the trust required 
for inserting keys into a machine. Using a cryptographic key 
in  a  voting  machine  will  require  trusting  the  hardware.  Our 
solution uses a TPM for its hardware protection. If the TPM’s 
endorsement  key  (EK)  were  revealed  by  a  malicious  hard-
ware manufacturer, this would undermine the election integ-
rity. However, this compromise requires a change in the man-
ufacturing  process  (we  assume  that  the  EK  is  generated  in-
side  the  TPM).  For  the  precinct  keys,  our  main  defense  is 
splitting keys after their generation and not rejoining the keys 
until  election  day.  One  must  break  the  machine’s  hardware 
protection to retrieve the key after its machine insertion. 
     One  of  our  main  goals  was  simplicity  in  the  voting 
system. Accordingly, the only additional burden on the voter 
is the requirement of using a password, a concept most voters 
are  already  familiar  with  in  other  contexts  (voter  passcodes 
have been used in a recent election in Hawaii [18]). Although 
attestation is unusual, it is conceptually simple (“Is the right 
software  running  on  the  machine?”)  and  is  optional.  Furth-
ermore, to  make attestation practical and  simple,  voters can 
use  easy-to-use  smart  phone  software  to  download  the 
necessary data from a website they trust. The software can do 
all of the checking and warn the voter if anything is amiss. 
     Issuing voter receipts is one area that also needs attention. 
Receipts  hold  great  promise,  but  they  need  to  be  carefully 
tested before deployment. In  our view, the  main purpose of 
the  receipt  is  so  the  voter  can  see  that  his  or  her  vote  was
