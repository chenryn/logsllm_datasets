Secure and Lightweight Fine-grained
Searchable Data Sharing for IoT-oriented and
Cloud-assisted Smart Healthcare System
Yangyang Bao, Weidong Qiu, Xiaochun Cheng
Abstract—It is a new trend in healthcare informatization construction to build the smart healthcare system by using the Internet of
Things (IoT) and cloud. This IoT-oriented and cloud-assisted healthcare system enables the doctor to monitor the patient’s health state
to respond to the paroxysmal diseases in real time. Considering the sensitivity of the patient’s privacy, it is necessary to encrypt the
cloud-stored health data to prevent the semi-trusted cloud and unauthorized users from accessing them. However, the encrypted
health data stored in the cloud brings inconvenience to the retrieval for the data user. In addition, the expensive computational
consumption also raises the challenge to the resource-constrained devices in the patient and doctor sides. To support efﬁcient
ciphertext retrieval and cope with the performance challenge, in this paper we propose a lightweight attribute-based searchable
encryption (LABSE) scheme, which realizes ﬁne-grained access control and keyword search, while reducing the computational
overhead for the resource-constrained devices. We rigorously prove the semantic security of the proposed LABSE scheme, and
analyze other security properties to response the security requirements under the healthcare scenario. Subsequently, we construct a
concrete deployment model for LABSE under the healthcare system. We also compare LABSE with the state-of-art related schemes in
terms of functionality and complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality and performance advantages by the experiment.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, with the technical advance in wireless
sensor network [1], we have witnessed the vigorous devel-
opment of the Internet of Things (IoT) [2, 3]. Featured with
instantaneity, universality and easy to deploy, IoT attracts
increasing popularity and attentions from the public, and
has been widely applied in various ﬁelds such as smart
transportation [4], healthcare [5], smart home [6], industrial
manufacturing [7] and smart grids [8]. In essence, IoT pro-
vides an efﬁcient data service mechanism, which enables
people to dynamically and accurately monitor an object by
using the real-time collected data, this is especially valuable
in the ﬁeld of healthcare [9]. So, it becomes a new develop-
ing trend in the healthcare ﬁeld that build the healthcare
system with the IoT. In a typical IoT-oriented healthcare
system, the implantable sensor and the wearable sensor
[10] collect the real-time health data (including the blood
pressure, the heart rate, the breathing rate, and etc.), then
forward it to the terminal device owned by the speciﬁed
doctor. In this way, the doctor can monitor the patient’s
health precisely in real time, so as to provide the health
advice and diagnosis scheme, and to be able to respond to
the potential paroxysmal diseases. Usually, the patient can
also choose to upload the collected health data to the cloud
[11, 12], in addition to being downloaded by his/her doctor,

the data can also be used for research purpose by medical
institutions, then the patient would be rewarded for the data
sharing. However, there is a dilemma lies ahead: If we send
and store the data to the cloud in the form of plaintext, then
the sensitive data privacy would be easily exposed to the
attacker, the unauthorized data users as well as the cloud
(the cloud is set to be semi-trusted, and is curious to the
stored data) [13–16]. In contrast, if we upload the health data
to the cloud in the encrypted form, then it is hard for the
authorized data user to distinguish the desired encrypted
data from massive ciphertext stored in the cloud.
A theoretically possible solution to the dilemma is
enabling the data user to download all his/her authorized-
access ciphertext and decrypt them, but it undoubtedly con-
sumes inestimable heavy computational and storage over-
heads, thus is obviously impracticable. Fortunately, search-
able encryption (SE) was proposed as a feasible and efﬁcient
solution. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in a typical SE scheme,
the data owner selects a keyword from the public keyword
dictionary, then generates the ciphertext and embeds the
selected keyword into the ciphertext. In another side, the
data user ﬁrst selects a queried keyword from the dictionary,
then generates a trapdoor associated with his/her queried
keyword and forwards the it to the cloud. In this way, the
cloud can retrieve the corresponding ciphertext according to
the trapdoor.
Inspired by the feature of efﬁcient ciphertext retrieval,
researches have devoted their efforts to the SE schemes for
the healthcare ﬁeld in recent years [17–20]. However, the
practical healthcare scenarios require the doctor and the
medical institution are able to ﬂexibly access the health data
from various patients according to the system authorization,

1.1 Our contributions
2
Till date, there is not an ABSE scheme that can system-
atically solve the challenge of expensive computational time
and energy consumption for the resource-constrained de-
vices in the patient and doctor side of the IoT-oriented and
cloud-assisted smart healthcare system. Motivated by this,
in this paper, efﬁciency-focused, we propose a lightweight
attribute-based searchable encryption (LABSE) scheme for
the IoT-oriented and cloud-assisted smart healthcare sys-
tem. Speciﬁcally, the contributions of our work this paper
are enumerated as follows.
1). Expressive ﬁne-grained access control and keyword
search. We put forward the lightweight key-policy ABSE
scheme, which provides ﬁne-grained access control and
ciphertext search simultaneously. Speciﬁcally, the cloud
retrieves the data user’s desired ciphertext according
to the trapdoor, and assists the user to decrypt the
ciphertext. During this process, the cloud cannot reveal
any identity information about the data user. Besides,
LABSE supports the expression of various access poli-
cies (including AND, OR, and Threshold) by applying
the LSSS access structure.
2). Enabling lightweight operations for resource-constrained
devices. We design the lightweight operations for
resource-constrained devices in the patient and doctor
sides under practical healthcare scenarios. Speciﬁcal-
ly, in the encryption phase, we design to enable the
implantable/wearable device generate a ciphertext by
consuming only a few and constant size computational
resource, instead of simply transferring the expensive
operations to the leisure time. During the trapdoor
generation phase, distinct from related works, the doc-
tor side resource-constrained devices can generate a
valid trapdoor of the queried keyword with the few-
er operations. In the ciphertext decryption phase, the
doctor side resource-constrained device delegates the
expensive operations to the cloud without revealing the
data privacy.
3). Deployment model. We construct a concrete deploy-
ment model under the IoT-oriented and cloud-assisted
healthcare system for our LABSE scheme. Except for
equipped with the aforementioned superiority of LAB-
SE, the deployment model also provides the authenti-
cation mechanism by using the ECDSA signature pro-
tocol.
4). Evaluation of security and performance. We rigorous-
ly prove the semantic security of the proposed LAB-
SE scheme, and analyze the security features in the
healthcare scenario. Subsequently, we implement our
LABSE scheme and compare it with state-of-art relat-
ed schemes. The experiment results demonstrate that
LABSE is superior to previous related works in practical
performance.
1.2 Organizations
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 discusses the literatures related to our work. Sec-
tion 3 enumerates the basic theory that is necessary for our
work. Section 4 introduces the system overview, the security
model and the security requirements of LABSE. Section 5
Fig. 1: The architecture of searchable encryption
while the patient’s identity privacy should not be disclosed
to doctors and medical institutions, even if they are autho-
rized to access. This seems to be a tough nut, but what
is surprising is that attribute-based encryption (ABE) [23]
perfectly satisﬁes the above requirements.
ABE regards whether an attribute set satisﬁes an access
structure as the criteria to judge the access authorization of
a data user, thus providing one-to-many ﬁne-grained access
control. More speciﬁcally, ABE schemes are categorized as
key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-
ABE) [23] according to their different authorization man-
agement: In the application scenario of KP-ABE [24], the
data owner is labelled with a set of descriptive attribute set,
while the data user is assigned an access structure according
to his/her enjoyed service scope. The data user can access
the data only if his/her speciﬁed access structure satisﬁes
the data owner’s attribute set. In contrast, in the application
scenario of CP-ABE, the access structure is designed by the
data owner himself/herself, he/she can decrypt the cipher-
text generated by the data owner only if the data owner’s
attribute set content his/her access structure. Motivated
by this, researchers combined ABE and SE to present the
novel cryptographic primitive of attribute-based searchable
encryption (ABSE) [17, 26, 28], which inherits the traits of
ciphertext keyword search and ﬁne-grained access control,
and is expected to be deployed in the smart healthcare
system [41].
However, the exponentiation and the pairing opera-
tions in the above ABSE schemes incur heavy computa-
tional overheads, this implies that the resource-constrained
devices in patient and doctor sides require more time to
share and recover the health data, which is obviously
unacceptable in the healthcare scenario that emphasizes
instantaneity. To accelerate the speed of encryption and
decryption, a few latest literatures were published to reduce
the computational overheads in online encryption phase
and decryption phase with the online/ofﬂine encryption
[39] and outsourced decryption [42] technology, respective-
ly. However, online/ofﬂine encryption just “transfers” the
operation of some ciphertext components generation to idle
time, and does not actually reduce the consumption of
computational resources and energy of the sensor. Besides,
considering that these implantable and wearable sensors
are usually battery-powered, so they have to be charged
frequently to supply the expensive energy consumption
(some implantable sensors are even non-rechargeable, they
would maintain a shorter lifespan).

2 RELATED WORKS
Lightweight attribute-based encryption. ABE derives from
the fuzzy identity-based encryption (IBE) proposed by Sahai
and Waters [29]. As the extension of IBE, ABE replaces the
speciﬁc identity of users with a set of descriptive attributes.
If the collection of attributes satisﬁes the speciﬁed access
structure, the data user can be granted to access the data
without revealing his/her identity. In this manner, ABE
realizes the one-to-many ﬁne-grained access control as well
as user’s identity privacy preserving. As previously men-
tioned, ABE is categorized as CP-ABE [23] and KP-ABE [24]
according to the authorization management, and they are
suitable for different application scenarios. However, a large
amount of pairing and exponential operations constraints
the practical performance of these ABE schemes, and in
some ABE schemes, the computational overheads of data
owners and data users even increases with the number of
attributes. To respond the efﬁciency constraint, Hohenberg-
er et al. [39] presented a novel primitive called online/ofﬂine
ABE, and constructed an online/ofﬂine ABE scheme based
on the large-universe KP-ABE scheme [25]. This scheme is
designed to enable the data user precomputes the neces-
sary ciphertext components during the ofﬂine phase, then
he/she can quickly generate the ciphertext at the cost of a
few computations upon inputting the attribute set and the
data to be encrypted. Rao et al. [31] put forward several
KP-ABE schemes with short ciphertext size, they generate
the ciphertext with only constant number of exponential
operations. However, the aforementioned works only focus
on the computational overhead of the data owner. To reduce
the decryption overhead for the data user, Lai et al. [42]
proposed the CP-ABE scheme with outsourced decryption,
in which most of the decryption operations are outsourced
to a powerful semi-trusted server. In order to prevent the
server from revealing the data privacy, the data user is re-
quired to conduct extra exponential precomputations before
forwarding the ciphertext to the server.
Attribute-based encryption with keyword search. To attain
efﬁcient keyword retrieval over the ciphertext, Boneh et
al. [33] proposed the ﬁrst public-key encryption with key-
word search (PEKS) scheme. On this basis, a sequence
of SE schemes with extended functionality and improved
security have been published in the literature [18–22]. It
is remarkable that researchers have combined ABE with
SE to satisfy the requirement of ﬁne-grained access control
and ciphertext retrieval in practical scenarios. Yu et al. [30]
presented a KP-ABE scheme with keyword search, it instan-
tiates multiple kinds of access policies by the tree access
structure, but this scheme does not take any other measure
to reduce the computational burden for the user. Li et al. [27]
presented the ABSE scheme with outsourced decryption for
the cloud storage, with the purpose of reducing the data
user’s decryption overheads. However, this scheme does
not take the computational cost of the data owner side into
3
consideration. Miao et al. [28] proposed a lightweight ﬁne-
grained searchable encryption scheme with the tree access
structure for fog computing, which reliefs the computational
cost for both the data owner and the data user, but the
computational cost for data encryption raises with the num-
ber of attributes. Wang et al. [40] put forward a CP-ABE
scheme with keyword search for the e-healthcare cloud,
which realizes policy hidden, and signiﬁcantly reduces the
computational cost and storage cost for both the data owner
and the data user side. Miao et al. [41] presented a searchable
CP-ABE scheme for the cloud-assisted healthcare industrial
IoT, this scheme enables the data owner to quickly generate
the ciphertext during the online encryption phase with the
online/ofﬂine technology [39], but it does not actually relief
the total computational burden for the data owner. Cui
et al. [38] respectively constructed a CP-ABE and a KP-
ABE scheme with keyword search. Similar to [41], the total
encryption burden for the data owner remains heavy, but it
alleviates the data user’s trapdoor generation cost with an
elegant trick.
3 PRELIMINARIES
Bilinear Map. Let G and GT be two multiplicative
cyclic groups with prime order p, and g, h are two generator
of group G. The bilinear map that deﬁned as e : G × G →
GT is featured as follows.
• Bilinearity. For all g, h ∈ G, α, β ∈ Zp, we have
e(gα, hβ) = e(g, h)αβ.
• Non-degeneracy. e(g, h) ̸= 1;
• Computaility. For all g, h ∈ G, e(g, h) can be efﬁciently
computed.
Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS). Assume P is a
set of parties, M is set as a nr × nc LSSS matrix, ρ(·) is a
function which maps each row of the matrix M to a speciﬁc
party in P . The LSSS for the access structure A of a set of
parties P is consists of two algorithms as below.
• Share. This algorithm ﬁrst takes as input the se-
cret value to be shared α, then it randomly selects
∈ Zp and deﬁne a vector ⃗v = (α, v2, ..., vnc).
v2, ..., vnc
It computes φρ(k) = ⃗Mk·⃗v, then outputs {φρ(k)}k∈[1,nr]
as nr shares of the secret value α, where ⃗Mk denotes
the k-th row of the LSSS matrix M, and the share φρ(k)
belongs to a party ρ(k).
• Reconstruct. Let S ∈ A be an attribute set, this
∑
algorithm takes M, ρ(·) and S as input, then gener-
ates a set of constants {uk}k∈[1,nr] ⊂ Zp, such that
⃗Mk · uk = (1, 0, ..., 0), where K denotes the set
k∈K
of all k that satisfy ρ(k) ∈ S. Finally, the secret value
can be recovered by computing
