### Code Explanation

In the provided code snippet, the `status` variable represents the security status of a URL and can take one of five values. The `status` variable is initially set to 0, indicating a safe URL. The values are as follows:
- **0**: The URL is considered safe.
- **1**: The URL is detected as a phishing site.
- **2**: The URL is detected as a malware site.
- **3**: The URL is both a phishing and malware site.
- **4**: The URL is checked and found safe through Safe Browsing and PhishTank, but ends with “.apk”.

The code snippet is as follows:

```java
status++;
if (status == 0 && endWithApk(url)) {
    status = 4;
}
return status;
```

### 3.2 Security Warning Design

Research has shown that the design of security warnings significantly influences whether users heed or ignore them [22, 23]. Therefore, creating an effective security warning that provides clear risk perception is a crucial aspect of our solution. We incorporated existing warning design recommendations [22, 24] and Microsoft’s NEAT (Neat, Explained, Actionable, Tested) & SPRUCE (Source, Process, Risk, Unique, Choices, and Evidence) [25] into our warning message design. Our approach includes the following:

1. **Color Scheme**: The warnings are primarily designed using black and red colors, which have been shown to be highly effective in preventing user exposure to attacks [22].
2. **Action Button Visibility**: The safest action, "Get me out of here," is made the most visible by setting its background color to green, which also encourages users to think of safe actions.
3. **Concise Text**: To avoid user fatigue from lengthy text, we include only necessary words in the warning, with an option to click "Show Details" for more information.
4. **Simple Language**: We use simple language to ensure that users understand the warning without being confused by technical jargon.

Two screenshots of our solution are provided in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b):
- **Figure 2(a)**: Displays the warning when a user scans a QR code with a phishing or malware URL.
- **Figure 2(b)**: Shows the warning when a user scans a QR code whose encoded URL ends with “.apk”.

If the URL points to a phishing website or contains malware, we immediately return a negative evaluation, as shown in Figure 2(a). If the URL ends with “.apk,” we return an uncertain evaluation, as shown in Figure 2(b), because .apk files may not necessarily be malicious. Compared to Norton Snap and QR Pal, our security warning design is better understood by providing sufficient risk details and recommended actions without using technical jargon, as confirmed by the results of our user study in the next section.

### 4. USER STUDY

To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we conducted a user study to explore the impact of our security warning design. The study also compared our solution against two existing solutions, Norton Snap and QR Pal, and examined how these solutions perform in the absence of any visual security warning.

#### 4.1 Design and Recruitment

We defined four user groups, each exposed to a different type of warning provided by a different QR code scanner:
- **Group 1**: Exposed to the attack with no warning (using a standard QR-code Scanner).
- **Group 2**: Exposed to the attack with Norton Snap’s warning.
- **Group 3**: Exposed to the attack with QR Pal’s warning.
- **Group 4**: Exposed to the attack with our designed warning.

We performed a power analysis to determine the minimum sample size required to test our hypotheses. With an error rate of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, we determined a minimum sample size of 19 subjects across the four groups. Based on this, we recruited 80 participants, with 20 subjects in each group. Participants were required to have a Facebook account to test their reactions after scanning a QR code containing the URL of the Facebook authentication page.

Our participants included 20 females and 60 males, all with at least a high school degree, and 83.75% (67/80) having or currently pursuing undergraduate degrees. The age distribution was as follows:
- 38 participants aged 10-20 years old.
- 32 participants aged 21-30 years old.
- 5 participants aged 31-40 years old.
- 2 participants aged 41-50 years old.
- 2 participants aged 51-60 years old.
- 1 participant aged 61-70 years old.

In terms of security knowledge, only 7 participants claimed to have poor security knowledge, while 54% (43/80) reported good or above security knowledge.

#### 4.2 Experiment

During the experiment, 20 participants were randomly assigned to each of the four test groups. Each group was exposed to a phishing attack; three groups received specific warnings from Norton Snap, QR Pal, and SafeQR, while the fourth group received no warning. To avoid framing effects, we informed participants that we were investigating the usability of QR code scanners to access websites, rather than testing their reaction to security warnings.

The hypotheses tested were:
1. User unawareness of malicious QR codes.
2. Effectiveness of QR code-based phishing attacks.
3. Helpfulness of security warnings.
4. Verification that our proposed warning design is more effective than existing solutions.

Participants were given an Android smartphone with the QR code apps installed and were encouraged to use the app with their real credentials. They were asked to act as if they were using their own phone, making decisions as they would on their private device. Security was not explicitly mentioned.

#### 4.3 User Study Results

Each participant completed an exit survey to test our hypotheses. Our first hypothesis was tested by asking participants if they had ever considered security issues related to QR codes. Out of 80 participants, 67.5% (54/80) were unaware of the existence of malicious QR codes, confirming that most users are unaware of this threat.

For the second hypothesis, we found that without any added security mechanisms, the phishing attack was highly effective, with 100% (20/20) of the participants opening the link and 75% (15/20) submitting their Facebook username and password.

The third hypothesis was confirmed by the results showing that security warnings from QR code scanners (Norton Snap, QR Pal, and SafeQR) helped users perceive potential dangers and avoid phishing attacks. Table 3 summarizes the results:

| Group              | Open Link | Submit Credentials |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| QR-code Scanner    | 20        | 15                 |
| Norton Snap        | 15        | 7                  |
| QR Pal             | 9         | 7                  |
| SafeQR (Our Solution) | 3       | 2                  |

Our solution, SafeQR, was more effective than the existing solutions. In terms of opening the link, Norton Snap prevented 5 out of 20 users from opening the link, QR Pal prevented 11 out of 20, and SafeQR prevented 17 out of 20. For credential submission, both Norton Snap and QR Pal prevented 13 out of 20 users from submitting their credentials, while SafeQR prevented 18 out of 20.

### 5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we presented an approach to prevent QR code-based phishing and malware attacks. We first studied the detection rates of existing QR code scanners for malicious URLs and then proposed a more effective solution using two well-known security APIs and a visually effective warning design. We also discussed the design and results of our user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Future work includes:
1. Analyzing the data from the user study to provide guidelines for designing effective security warnings on mobile phones.
2. Extending our research to enhance the security of QR codes themselves, possibly through cryptographic methods for certification and identification.
3. Evaluating our solution using sample URLs from other sources such as Spamscatter.
