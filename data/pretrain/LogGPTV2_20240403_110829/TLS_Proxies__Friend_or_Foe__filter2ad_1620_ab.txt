Mandela, Sports, Basketball, NSA, Internet, Freedom,
Paul Walker, Security, LeBron James, Haiyan, Snowden,
PlayStation 4, Miley Cyrus, Xbox One, iPhone 5s.
This campaign generated 4,634,386 impressions and
3,897 clicks (not required to complete the measurement)
at a cost of $4,911.97. In total we completed 2,861,244
successful measurements.
4.2 Ethical Considerations
Our experimental design limits potential harm to users.
Our tool makes several request to a web server we con-
trol, which is largely indistinguishable from the traﬃc
generated by advertisements that load images, audio,
or video from a web server. If network administrators
were to investigate this traﬃc by visiting our web server,
they would be shown a description of our research and
provided with our contact information2. Our tool also
logs the substitute certiﬁcate a browser sees, which some
organizations or individuals may consider a privacy leak;
this is balanced by only examining modiﬁcations made
to a connection to our own web server and the potential
beneﬁts that come from viewing certiﬁcate information
to identify malware. This and Huang’s work [9] has
informed the community about these practices and mo-
tivated a subsequent study that identiﬁed weaknesses in
personal ﬁrewalls [5]. Other than the certiﬁcate, we only
record data that is present in the web server’s connection
log. Finally, our tool complies with Google AdWords’
terms of service.
5. RESULTS
During the ad campaign, we served 4.36 million ads
and successfully completed 2.86 million measurements.
Of those tests, 11,764 returned a diﬀerent X.509 certiﬁ-
cate than was served by our secure web server, indicating
the presence of a TLS proxy.
The users behind a proxied connection that were iden-
tiﬁed by our campaign originated in 142 countries and
from 8,589 distinct IP addresses. Due to the targeting
algorithms used by Google AdWords, our tool’s exposure
to these countries is not uniformly distributed. Table 1
shows the countries with the most proxied connections
in our study. For each country, the table lists the to-
tal number of proxied connections, the total number of
connections, and the percentage of total connections to
that country that were proxied. Some countries have
signiﬁcantly higher percentages of proxied connections
than the average, including France (1.09%), Canada
(0.87%), Belgium (0.81%), the United States (0.79%),
and Romania (0.74%). Together, connections from the
United States and Brazil account for 36% of detected
proxies.

We ﬁrst analyze the contents of the Issuer Organiza-
tion in the substitute certiﬁcates we collected. We use
OpenSSL to decode the certiﬁcates and store them in a
database, where we can run queries. We also manually
inspect the contents of the relevant ﬁelds to identify the
issuing organization and their software products, using
web searches to determine their identity. We empha-
size that our results in this section are based on the
intercepting proxy self-identifying themselves in the cer-
tiﬁcate. It is certainly possible that malicious proxies
have hidden their tracks by masquerading as a legitimate
organization in the Issuer Organization ﬁeld, and we
cannot detect this.
Table 2 shows the values for the Issuer Organization
ﬁeld of the substitute certiﬁcates. Table 3 provides
a breakdown of values present in the Issuer Organiza-
tion ﬁeld of the substitute certiﬁcates. The majority
of certiﬁcates from proxied connections have an Issuer
Organization ﬁeld matching the name of a personal
or enterprise ﬁrewall (69.54%). Another 12.66% have
the name of an organization set as the Issuer Organi-
zation (e.g., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
Lincoln Financial Group). Additionally, 7% (829) of
the substitute certiﬁcates have null values for the Issuer
Organization ﬁeld.
The most suspicious activities discovered were revealed
by certiﬁcates with an Issuer Organization that matched
the names of malware. “Sendori, Inc,”“WebMakerPlus
Ltd,” and “IopFailZeroAccessCreate” appeared in 966, 95,
and 21 Issuer Organization ﬁelds, respectively. Sendori
