of observations in the one-view and two-view conditions. For PAT/NPAT, there is 50% less observations in
one-view condition with a signiﬁcant proportion necessary for statistical testing, and the two-view conditions
for PAT/NPAT are of the same magnitude as the video study (see Table 6).
In total, we were able to run complete trials for 18 participants each for PAT and NPAT, and all of those
36 participants also completed a PIN viewing. The order between PIN and PAT/NPAT for participants was
randomized, so that half of the participants completed a PIN trial before doing a PAT/NPAT trial, and the
other half completed the protocol in the reverse order, PAT/NPAT then PIN.
3.2 Live Simulation Setup and Coordination
We sought to recreate nearly the same scenario for shoulder surﬁng as the video study. Namely, we had our
victim placed in a sitting position with the participant observer behind the victim, either standing to the
right or the left, directed by one of two proctors. These were the same positions where the cameras were
located (near left and near right views) in the study by Aviv et al. [4]. See Figure 1 for a visual of this
arrangement for the live study.
Additionally, for the phone application used to enter the passcodes, we used the same mobile applications
as in the prior study, which includes a web-based platform for entering PINs and patterns. Screenshots of
those applications are provided in Figure 2.
For patterns with feedback lines, the white tracing lines would follow the user gesture, and once the
pattern was entered, it would remain visible on-screen for a half a second before disappearing. The same
would be true for the patterns without feedback lines, however, neither the tracing lines nor the contact
points of the grid would be rendered on the screen. For PINs, the layout allowed for numeric entry as
expected. Once digit keys were selected, the corresponding digits were presented on the interface. These
would then fade to a * after a half a second, similar to most mobile PIN entry interfaces.
For the participant observer to record their pattern entry, we used pen and paper. Examples of the
observer forms are provided in the Appendix (A.3). The forms had text boxes and mini-diagrams of the
application interfaces, so the participants could easily record the observed entry. Participants were asked
not to write down the passcodes observed until directed following all observations, which was important for
the multiple viewing scenario.
As shown in Figure 1, two pre-marked spots were placed on the ﬂoor to direct participants where to
stand on the left or right side. The second proctor, following the randomized treatment order, would call
out directions to the participant; for example, “one view, from the left” or “two views, ﬁrst from left and
then right.” Once the participant was in place for each view, the second proctor would cue the ﬁrst proctor
(playing the victim) to enter a passcode.
At this point, a signiﬁcant challenge we had to overcome was how to prompt the victim-proctor with
the correct passcode to enter without tipping oﬀ the participant-observer. Due to the randomization pro-
cedures, requiring the victim-proctor to memorize the numerous orderings was not realistic. As a solution,

we developed a Google Glass application to guide the victim-proctor through the various passcode orders.
Google Glass is a wearable eyeglass display unit that runs on a modiﬁed Android OS. It enables one to scroll
interactively through images projected onto a viewing screen built into the right eyepiece. Moreover, the
small display screen on the Google Glass was not visible to the participant. A screenshot of the Google Glass
application is provided in Figure 3.
3.3 Procedure
The replication experiment proceeded in four stages:
1. Informed Consent and Ante Hoc Questionnaire: All participants were properly informed and con-
sented, as we conducted an IRB approved experiment. Following consent, we asked participants to
complete an ante hoc questionnaire that covered basic demographic questions, such as age and gender,
as well as questions regarding the participants experience with smartphones, mobile authentication,

and sense of risk from shoulder surﬁng. The subjective response questions were largely intended to
orient participants to physical security issues related to the study. The ante hoc questions are found
in the Appendix (A.1).
2. Training: Depending on the set of authentications being observed in the trial run, a training session
would include two basic passcodes, the L shape for patterns and the 1234 PIN, to help familiarize the
participant with the procedures, how to record on the observation sheets, and where to stand for the
trials (similar training was performed in the video study). Additional training on how to ﬁll out the
observation form was also provided, which is included in the Appendix (A.3).
3. Trial: Under the direction of the proctor, the participant conducted 10 observations of either the PAT
or NPAT pattern entry, and 10 observations of PIN entry.
4. Post Hoc Questionnaire: Following the trials, the participant answered a series of post hoc questions
related to the challenge of the task and his/her perceived performance thereon. See Appendix A.2 for
the set of post hoc questions.
As each participant completed two trials, one for either PAT or NPAT and another for PIN, once the trial
stage was over for the ﬁrst authentication we would return to training for the second authentication. As a
way to control for training eﬀects, whereby observing PINs ﬁrst could increase or decrease performance on
