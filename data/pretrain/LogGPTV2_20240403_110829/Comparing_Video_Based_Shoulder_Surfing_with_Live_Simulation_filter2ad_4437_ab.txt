### Observations in One-View and Two-View Conditions

For PAT/NPAT, there are 50% fewer observations in the one-view condition compared to the two-view condition, with a significant proportion necessary for statistical testing. The number of observations in the two-view conditions for PAT/NPAT is similar to that in the video study (see Table 6).

In total, we conducted complete trials for 18 participants each for PAT and NPAT, and all 36 participants also completed a PIN viewing. The order between PIN and PAT/NPAT was randomized, so that half of the participants completed a PIN trial before a PAT/NPAT trial, and the other half completed the protocol in the reverse order (PAT/NPAT then PIN).

### 3.2 Live Simulation Setup and Coordination

We aimed to recreate a shoulder surfing scenario similar to the video study. Specifically, the "victim" was placed in a sitting position, with the participant observer standing behind the victim, either to the right or left, as directed by one of two proctors. These positions corresponded to the camera locations (near left and near right views) in the study by Aviv et al. [4]. See Figure 1 for a visual representation of this arrangement in the live study.

Additionally, we used the same mobile applications as in the prior study for entering passcodes, including a web-based platform for PINs and patterns. Screenshots of these applications are provided in Figure 2.

For patterns with feedback lines, white tracing lines would follow the user's gesture and remain visible on-screen for half a second after the pattern was entered. For patterns without feedback lines, neither the tracing lines nor the contact points of the grid would be rendered on the screen. For PINs, the layout allowed for numeric entry, with selected digits appearing on the interface and fading to a * after half a second, similar to most mobile PIN entry interfaces.

Participants recorded their observed pattern entries using pen and paper. Examples of the observer forms are provided in the Appendix (A.3). The forms included text boxes and mini-diagrams of the application interfaces to facilitate recording. Participants were instructed not to write down the observed passcodes until directed, which was crucial for the multiple viewing scenario.

As shown in Figure 1, two pre-marked spots on the floor directed participants where to stand on the left or right side. The second proctor, following the randomized treatment order, would call out directions to the participant, such as "one view, from the left" or "two views, first from left and then right." Once the participant was in place for each view, the second proctor would cue the first proctor (playing the victim) to enter a passcode.

A significant challenge was prompting the victim-proctor with the correct passcode without alerting the participant-observer. To address this, we developed a Google Glass application to guide the victim-proctor through the passcode orders. Google Glass is a wearable eyeglass display unit running on a modified Android OS, enabling interactive scrolling through images projected onto a viewing screen in the right eyepiece. The small display screen on the Google Glass was not visible to the participant. A screenshot of the Google Glass application is provided in Figure 3.

### 3.3 Procedure

The replication experiment proceeded in four stages:

1. **Informed Consent and Ante Hoc Questionnaire:**
   - All participants were properly informed and consented, as part of an IRB-approved experiment.
   - Following consent, participants completed an ante hoc questionnaire covering basic demographic questions (age, gender), experience with smartphones and mobile authentication, and their sense of risk from shoulder surfing. The subjective response questions were intended to orient participants to physical security issues related to the study. The ante hoc questions are found in the Appendix (A.1).

2. **Training:**
   - Depending on the set of authentications being observed, a training session included two basic passcodes (L shape for patterns and 1234 PIN) to familiarize participants with the procedures, how to record on the observation sheets, and where to stand for the trials. Additional training on how to fill out the observation form was also provided, which is included in the Appendix (A.3).

3. **Trial:**
   - Under the direction of the proctor, the participant conducted 10 observations of either the PAT or NPAT pattern entry and 10 observations of PIN entry.

4. **Post Hoc Questionnaire:**
   - After the trials, participants answered a series of post hoc questions related to the challenge of the task and their perceived performance. The set of post hoc questions is provided in the Appendix (A.2).

Each participant completed two trials, one for either PAT or NPAT and another for PIN. Once the trial stage for the first authentication was over, we returned to training for the second authentication. This controlled for training effects, where observing PINs first could influence performance on subsequent tasks.
