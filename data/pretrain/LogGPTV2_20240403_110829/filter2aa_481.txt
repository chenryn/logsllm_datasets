#### 1. Introduction
- **Project Name:** x06d
- **Principal Investigator (PI):** [Email Address]

#### 2. The Problem: Re-Anonymizing You!
- **Overall State of the Web:**
  - **Client/Browser Issues:**
    - It is challenging to make public browsers secure enough to keep users safe.
  - **Server Landscape:**
    - There are multiple layers to secure, and portions of a served application often act as clients for other sites.
- **Reference:**
  - "De-Anonymizing You!" by RSnake and Jabra (DEF CON 17)
- **x06p:**
  - A proof-of-concept (POC) for browser-based defenses.
  - **Goal:** Provide pseudo-protection for up to six days.

#### 3. Defending Technique: SARS!
- **Sanitize Input to the Browser:**
  - Detect and control server content (e.g., using NoScript).
- **Anonymize the Browser:**
  - Make your browser appear like everyone else's or a specific user's.
- **Randomize Behavior:**
  - Create a generic browsing history and generate line noise.
- **Sanitize Output to the Server:**
  - Detect and neutralize interesting code (e.g., XSS).

#### 4. Defeating Attacks on Input
- **Sanitize Input to the Browser:**
  - Scan HTTP responses for malicious content.
  - Use plug-ins like NoScript.
- **Challenges:**
  - Whitelisting is difficult due to changing site content and the need for qualified content approval.
  - A public blacklist and signature detection can help mitigate these issues.

#### 5. Browser Tracking
- **Tools:**
  - panopticlick.eff.org
  - Some code borrowed from browserspy.dk and breadcrumbs.
- **Tracking Methods:**
  - Headers
  - History
  - Fonts
  - Plug-ins

#### 6. Defeating Header Detection
- **Generalize Request Headers:**
  - Except for URL and HOST.
- **Randomize Parameters:**
  - Change the order of GET/POST parameters.
  - Add benign parameters.
- **Cookie Automation:**
  - Clear cookies on browser open and close.
  - Rewrite cookies when stored and put them back before use.

#### 7. Browser Tracking Defenses
- **Easiest Method:**
  - Be just like everyone else.
- **Possible Method:**
  - Be like someone you want to frame.
- **SARS Implementation:**
  - Fake it dynamically or set it up before browsing.

#### 8. Defeating Font Detection
- **Install/Remove System Fonts:**
  - Match everyone else's fonts.
  - Easier in a VM with no third-party apps.
- **Match Specific User:**
  - Make a browser snapshot.
  - Share or trade font configurations.

#### 9. Defeating History Enumeration
- **Automate Browsing:**
  - Visit at least the top 500 Alexa sites.
- **Edit History:**
  - Replace non-popular sites with top 500.
- **Background Recrawling:**
  - Slowly recrawl the history to hide new patterns.

#### 10. Defeating Font and Plug-in Detection
- **Groom the Browser:**
  - Maintain a "normal" configuration.
  - Stash non-standard fonts while browsing.
- **Challenges:**
  - Multitasking and page-installed plug-ins.
  - Browser version compatibility.

#### 11. New Problems with Plug-ins
- **Popular Plug-ins:**
  - Avoid letting popular plug-ins dictate "normal."
- **Potential Solutions:**
  - Hook the browser to hide plug-ins.
  - Create a benign trojan plug-in.

#### 12. Defeating Attacks on Output
- **XSS Browser Helper Objects:**
  - Trap and scan requests sent by the browser.
  - Normalize output and supplement with shenanigan detection.
- **Challenges:**
  - False positives and normalization reliability.

#### 13. Font Defense Details
- **Detection:**
  - Easy with Flash or Java.
  - More work in JavaScript (measure pixel distance differences).

#### 14. Plug-in Defense Details
- **Manual Installation:**
  - Top 100 add-ons for Mozilla/Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera.

#### 15. Payload Defenses
- **Scanning Payloads:**
  - Neutralize file and host scanning.
  - Redirect private IPs and URLs.
- **Port Scanning:**
  - Use XMLHTTPRequest and aliases to google.com.
- **Jikto:**
  - Solves similar issues.

#### 16. Changing Fonts
- **Windows:**
  - Fonts are in %windir%\fonts.
  - Requires a shell object for installation/removal.
  - Remove registry keys for uninstallation.

#### 17. Defense Tools
- **Security Toolbar or BHO:**
  - Interception proxy and scripts.
- **x06d Suite:**
  - Available at sourceforge.net/project/x06d.
  - Includes JavaScript functions, BHO/addons, and a repository of client signatures.
  - Performs POC for all discussed techniques.

#### 18. Future Defenses
- **Non-text/html Scanning:**
  - Use ClamAV to defeat bait and switch, simple trojans, and phishing.
- **Duplicate Browsers:**
  - Diff response results and highlight discrepancies.
- **Defang and Rescan:**
  - Use the DOM to copy and redirect pages until they stabilize.

#### 19. Demos
- **Phishing Click-Through:**
  - Re-anonymize and validate with panopticlick.
- **XSS Click-Through:**
  - Demonstrate XSS protection.

#### 20. Summary
- **Browser Defenses:**
  - Just getting reliable.
  - Challenging to be thorough but essential.
- **Herd Defenses:**
  - Raise the noise level.
- **Framing Another User:**
  - Easier and potentially better.
