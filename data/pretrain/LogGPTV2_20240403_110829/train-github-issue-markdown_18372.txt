### Issue Report

#### Electron Version:
1.4.3

#### Operating System:
macOS Sierra 10.12

#### Description:
I have not found a similar issue in the existing reports, so I am creating this one. If it is a duplicate, please feel free to close it.

**Request:**
It would be very useful if we could add a separator in the Tray menu, similar to the `separator` type in the `menu-item`.

**Current Implementation:**
The current tray implementation does not include separators. Here is an example of how it currently looks:

**Desired Implementation:**
For better organization and clarity, I would like to see separators between different sections of the menu. For example, between "Upload" and "Settings," and between "Settings" and "Close."

Here is an example from macOS, which demonstrates the use of separators:
