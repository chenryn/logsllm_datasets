ABSTRACT
When Internet became commonplace in the mid-1990s, the
decision makers ignored it. They did not see it as important
or in any way relevant to them. As a direct result, global
freedom ﬂourished in the unrestricted online world. Sud-
denly people all over the world had in their reach something
truly and really global. And suddenly, people were not just
consuming content; they were creating content for others.
But eventually politicians and leaders realized just how
important the Internet is. And they realized how useful the
Internet was for other purposes — especially for the purposes
of doing surveillance on citizens.
The two arguably most important inventions of our gen-
eration — the Internet and the mobile phones — changed
the world. However, they both turned out to be perfect
tools for the surveillance state. And in a surveillance state,
everybody is assumed guilty.
Internet surveillance became front page material when
Edward Snowden started leaking information on PRISM,
Xkeyscore and other NSA programs in the summer of 2013.
But do not get me wrong. I do understand the need for
doing both monitoring and surveillance. If somebody is sus-
pected for running a drug ring, planning a school shooting,
or participating in a terror organization, he should be mon-
itored with a relevant court order.
However, that is not what PRISM is about. PRISM is
not about monitoring suspicious people. PRISM is about
monitoring everyone. It is about monitoring people that are
known to be innocent. And it is about building dossiers
on everyone, eventually going back decades. Such dossiers
based on our Internet activity will build a thorough picture
of us. And if the powers-that-be ever need to ﬁnd a way to
twist your hand, they would certainly ﬁnd something suspi-
cious or embarrassing on everyone, if they have enough of
their internet history recorded.
United States intelligence agencies have a full legal right
to monitor foreigners. Which does not sound too bad —
until you realize that most of us are foreigners to the Ameri-

cans. In fact, 96% of the people on the planet turn out to be
such “foreigners.” And when these people use US-based ser-
vices, they are legally under surveillance. When the PRISM
leaks started, US intelligence tried to calm the rest of the
world by explaining that there is no need to worry and that
these programs were just about ﬁghting terrorists. But then
further leaks proved that the United States was using their
tools to monitor the European Commission and the United
Nations as well. It is diﬃcult for them to argue that they
would be trying to ﬁnd terrorists in the European Union
headquarters.
Another argument we have heard from the US intelligence
apparatus is that everyone else is doing internet surveillance
too. And indeed, most countries do have intelligence agen-
cies, and most of them do monitor what other countries
are doing. However, United States has an unfair advantage.
Almost all of the common internet services, search engines,
webmails, web browsers and mobile operating systems come
from the USA. Put in another way: How many Spanish
politicians and decision makers use American services? An-
swer: All of them. And how many American politicians
and decision makers use Spanish services? Answer: None
of them. All this should make it obvious that we foreigners
should not use US-based services. They have proven to us
that they are not trustworthy. Why would we voluntarily
hand our data to a foreign intelligence agency?
But in practice, it is very hard to avoid using services like
Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Amazon, Skydrive,
iCloud, Android, Windows, iOS and so on. This is a clear
example on the failure of Europe, Asia and Africa to com-
pete with the USA on Internet services. And when the rest
of the world does produce a global hit, like Skype or Nokia, it
typically ends up acquired by an American company, bring-
ing it under US control.
But if you are not doing anything wrong, why worry about
this? Or, if you are worrying about this, what do you have
to hide? My answer to his question is that I have nothing
to hide but I have nothing in particular that I would want
to share with an intelligence agency either. In particular, I
have nothing to share with a foreign intelligence agency. If
we really need a big brother, I would rather have a domestic
big brother than a foreign big brother.
People have asked me if they really should worry about
PRISM. I have told them that they should not be worried —
they should be outraged instead. We should not just accept
such blanket and wholesale surveillance from one country
onto the rest of the world.

made wholesale surveillance possible. But they have also
made leaking possible. That is how Edward Snowden could
steal three laptops which contained so much information
that printed on paper it would be a long row of trucks full
of paper. Leaking has become so easy, it will keep organi-
zations worrying about getting caught over any wrongdoing.
We might wish this would force organizations to avoid un-
ethical practices. While governments are watching over us,
they know were watching over them.
