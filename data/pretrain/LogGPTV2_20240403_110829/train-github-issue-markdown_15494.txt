I have the following navbar on my website:
                Home
                One to One
                Classes 
                        Classes
                        Online Yoga Classes
                        Free Downloads
                        Gallery
                Retreats &amp; Workshops
                Pregnancy Mums
                Treatments
                About Me
                Testimonials
                About Yoga
The issue I am having is that when the navbar is collapsed on mobile devices
(it works correctly when collapsed using a desktop computer), the links within
my dropdown do not navigate to the new page, selecting a link within the
dropdown just closes the dropdown as though the click is being registered on
the dropdown parent li, not the link itself.
As I say when the navbar is expanded, or is collapsed on a device which uses a
mouse the link navigates to the new page correctly, it seems to be when I
press a link using a touch device that I have issues, you can view the problem

Any assistance with this would be much appreciated, thank you
