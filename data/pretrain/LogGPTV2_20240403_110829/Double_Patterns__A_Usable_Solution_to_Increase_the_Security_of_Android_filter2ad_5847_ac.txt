scenario, the scenario we envision Double Patterns being deployed.
Second, we identified numerous conflations in bias in our questions
that were improved in an expanded survey. Third, we implemented
two blocklisting treatments alongside our control treatment.
4.3 Recruitment
As part of the main study, we recruited 645 participants on Amazon
Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and after removing participants who
failed attention checks and/or provided inconsistent responses, we
included n = 634 participants in the our analysis: 209 in the control
treatment, 211 in BL-First treatment, and 214 in BL-Both treatment.
As is typically the case for MTurk, the sample is mostly young (67.5%
between 25-39), mostly male identifying (58% male, 40% female, and
2% other gender, or prefer not to say), and better educated (75%
with some college or more educational background) than the US
as a whole. Participant demographic is presented in Table 3, and
additional demographic information can be found in Appendix C.

Figure 3: Frequence of Start/End Choices Across Treatments.
4.4 Limitations
There are a number of limitations with our methods. First, as the
survey is online, without direct observations, it is possible for par-
ticipants to not follow directions properly and provide inconsistent
responses. We attempted to mitigate this limitation by including
attention tests and reviewing responses. Additionally, collecting
data via MTurk introduces some bias in the demographics (as noted
above), more balanced collection would be needed to support claims
regarding selection for demographics, which we do not make here.
As the survey is relatively short, the recall rates of DPatts reflect
short-term memorability of DPatts. We believe that high short-term
recall would correlate with good long-term recall, but to support
stronger claims about memorability, a longitudinal study would be
needed.
This survey may be many participants first experience with
Android patterns (in any form), and as such the DPatts selected
may not fully reflect choices in the wild. To mitigate this, we asked
participants if they would use their chosen DPatt on their own
device. Overall, 42.3% said that they would use the DPatt selected
during the survey on their device, if Double Pattern was available,
30.1% expressed they would not, and 27.6% indicated they were
unsure if they would use the DPatt selected during the survey (see
Table 2). The primary reason to not use the DPatt selected during
the survey (or were unsure) was the fact that the DPatt was recorded
as part of the survey, while a smaller number described wanting
something more secure or complex (see Table 10 in Appendix). This
suggests that the methods of the survey provide ecological validity
for the scope of DPatts users may select in the wild.
5 RESULTS
In this section we describe the results of our analysis of security
and usability of Double Patterns. First, we describe the statistics of
DPatt choice, including the frequency of various DPatts and features

therein. We then offer a security analysis using guessability as a
metric and compare DPatt with other mobile authentication options,
such as 4-/6-digit PINs and Android patterns. Finally, we provide
analysis of the usability based on the SUS responses, entry/recall
rates, and qualitative responses.
Datasets. As described previously, the survey applies three ran-
domized treatments: a control treatmenet with no intervention; a
blocklist first (BL-First) treatment, where the first pattern of a DPatt
is blocklisted; and a blocklist both (BL-Both) treatment, where the
combination of the two patterns in a DPatt is blocklisted.
We also compare the security of DPatt to 4-/6-digit PINs from
Markert et al. [19], which were collected with similar methodolo-
gies, a collection of 3x3 Android patterns used in a survey [6] and
originally collected in Aviv et. al [4], Uellenbeck et al. [26], Loge et
al. [18], and von Zezchwitz et al. [28]. Additionally, we make use of
a 4-digit PIN dataset collected by Daniel Amitay [1], and a dataset of
6-digit PINs derived from the RockYou password breach [13]. Both
datasets are used in similar ways by Wang et al. [29] and Bonneau
et al. [10].
5.1 Double Patterns Features
Table 4 reports the most frequent patterns in each treatment. The
first pattern of a DPatt is indicated in blue, and the second pattern
is indicated in green. The starting contact point of each individual
pattern is differentiated in bold. Common DPatts tend to be sym-
metric in shape; such as a box or flipped S’s. A second common
theme is non-overlapping/singularly-overlapping segments where
the individual patterns only share a single point or no points in
common, for example, rotated ⊓ or ⊔ shapes.
Observing the most common individual patterns, compared to
the 3x3 patterns reported in Aviv et al. [6]: 90.69% of the first pat-
terns and 86.75% of the second patterns were previously observed in
the dataset. Similarities of individual patterns is further supported
when looking at the common start and end contact points, as pre-
sented in Figure 3. As was the case in prior work, participants are
likely to start in the upper left and end in the lower right. However,
this effect is less evident for the second component pattern, where
the preference is more spread across the top row. This suggests that
selecting the second pattern, with the presence of the visual first
pattern, does alter some of the choices by individuals, as evident in
the lower percentage of second patterns previously observed in the
prior work.
When comparing the length (the number of points used in a
pattern), we find that there is a significant difference between the
length of the first component pattern and second pattern (U =
181136.5, p < 0.001), where the first pattern is slightly longer than
the second. This suggest that participants are “fitting in” their sec-
ond pattern into the shape of the first, and likely using fewer contact
points to do that. There were no observed statistical differences
between the length of individual patterns or the combination of
patterns in a DPatt between the treatments.
After DPatt selection, participants were asked to describe their
strategy regarding their chosen pattern, as well as Likert agreement
towards two questions: if the Double Pattern provides adequate
security, and if it was difficult to choose an appropriate Double Pat-
tern for unlocking a personal device. Examining a 25% sub-sample
of users, we coded their responses to the open question, and each
participant was assigned between one and three codes, depend-
ing on the depth of their response. Regarding strategy, the most
frequently cited strategies include aspects of visual characteristics
(59.3%), memorability (50.7%), personal familiarity (11.3%), usability
(10%), and security (4%). Of the 25% sub-sample, only a small portion
attributed their decision to random choice (5.3%). This is supported
by the obvious structure observed in the patterns in Figure 4.
5.2 Security
In this section, we discuss the evaluation of security of DPatts. We
first outline the threat model, and then provide guessability analy-
sis for two attacker variants, a perfect-knowledge and simulated

Threat model. We make the following assumptions about the
attacker in our threat model. First, the attacker is generic and not
