User: I have a linux VPS that uses an older version of python (2.4.3). This version doesn't include the UUID module, but I need it for a project. My options are to upgrade to python2.6 or find a way to make uuid work with the older version. I am a complete linux newbie. I don't know how to upgrade python safely or how I could get the UUID modules working with the already installed version. What is a better option and how would I go about doing it?
Assistant: The safest way to upgrading Python is to install it to a different location (away from the default system path).
To do this, download the source of python and do a 
./configure --prefix=/opt
(Assuming you want to install it to /opt which is where most install non system dependant stuff to)
The reason why I say this is because some other system libraries may depend on the current version of python.
Another reason is that as you are doing your own custom development, it is much better to have control over what version of the libraries (or interpreters) you are using rather than have a operating system patch break something that was working before. A controlled upgrade is better than having the application break on you all of a sudden.
