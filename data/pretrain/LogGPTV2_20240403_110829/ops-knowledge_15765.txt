I am currently learning Python from a very basic level and recently reinstalled Canopy on my MacBook. It was working fine before, but now I encounter an "Access Denied" error whenever I try to launch the editor.

Could someone please help me resolve this issue? Please keep in mind that I am quite new to this.

**Error Details:**
