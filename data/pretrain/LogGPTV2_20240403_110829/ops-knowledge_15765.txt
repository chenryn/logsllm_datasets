User: I'm learning python (from a very low baseline) and recently re-installed Canopy (on a MacBook) It was working fine before.
Now whenever I try an launch the editor I get a Access Denied error.
Can anyone help? Please bear in mind my inexperience
Thanks

Assistant: Since the supplied information is insufficient, the answer is the same. This is about user authentication. I don't know how you open the app but, your app tries to open a file or a process which is could not be opened by your user. If you open your app with root privileges there won't be any problem.
