### Setting Up a Desktop GUI on an Amazon EC2 Instance

I need to familiarize myself with some software that is not compatible with my home machines (Windows/Mac). Therefore, I decided to set up an Amazon EC2 instance and run the software there. However, setting up a remote desktop session on EC2 has proven to be more challenging than expected. I have tried various methods found through web searches, but most of them are outdated and no longer relevant.

#### Attempts So Far

1. **Yum Groups List:**
   ```bash
   [ec2-user@ip-xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ~]$ yum groups list
   Loaded plugins: priorities, update-motd, upgrade-helper
   Installed groups:
      Editors
      Legacy UNIX compatibility
      Mail Server
      Network Servers
      Perl Support
      System Tools
   Available Groups:
      Console internet tools
      DNS Name Server
      Development Libraries
      Development tools
      FTP Server
      Java Development
      MySQL Database
      MySQL Database client
      NFS file server
      Networking Tools
      PHP Support
      Performance Tools
      PostgreSQL Database client (version 8)
      PostgreSQL Database server (version 8)
      Scientific support
      TeX support
      Technical Writing
      Web Server
      Web Servlet Engine
   Done
   ```
   None of the available groups provide an X session.

2. **Other Solutions:**
   - **Community AMI:** The suggested community AMI no longer exists.
   - **Freenx:** Freenx is no longer available, and NoMachine's free version does not work.
   - **x2go:** x2go also failed to work.
   - **NoMachine:** Xvfb is not available.

#### Successful Setup

Following Matt's suggestion in the comments, I was able to set up an SSH tunnel and a local private key using the instructions from [this link](http://www.serverwatch.com/server-tutorials/setting-up-vnc-on-ubuntu-in-the-amazon-ec2-page-2.html).

**Steps:**

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
   sudo apt-get install vnc4server
   sudo apt-get install x11vnc
   x11vnc -storepasswd
   sudo apt-get install gnome-core gnome-session-fallback
   ```

2. **Start and Stop VNC Server:**
   ```bash
   vncserver
   vncserver -kill :1  # (to get the default xstartup file)
   ```

3. **Edit xstartup File:**
   Edit the `$HOME/.vnc/xstartup` file to look like this:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh

   # Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
   unset SESSION_MANAGER
   #exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
   gnome-session --session=gnome-classic &

   [ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
   [ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
   xsetroot -solid grey
   vncconfig -iconic &
   #x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80×24+10+10 -ls -title “$VNCDESKTOP Desktop” &
   #x-window-manager &
   ```

4. **Set a Password for the Ubuntu User:**
   ```bash
   sudo passwd ubuntu
   ```

5. **Reboot the Instance:**
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

6. **Start x11vnc:**
   ```bash
   sudo x11vnc -xkb -noxrecord -noxfixes -noxdamage -display :0 -auth /var/run/lightdm/root/:0 -usepw
   ```

7. **Connect via TightVNC:**
   Use TightVNC to connect to the EC2 instance and view the Ubuntu desktop.

This setup allowed me to successfully connect to the EC2 instance and see the Ubuntu desktop. I am not sure what other issues I may encounter, but at least I have made progress.

Thank you, Matt, for your help!
