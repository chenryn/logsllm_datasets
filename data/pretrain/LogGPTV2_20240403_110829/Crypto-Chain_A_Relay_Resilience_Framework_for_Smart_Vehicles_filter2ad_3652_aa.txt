ABSTRACT
Recent findings show that smart vehicles can be exposed to relay
attacks resulting from weaknesses in cryptographic operations,
such as authentication and key derivation, or poor implementa-
tion of these operations. Relay attacks refer to attacks in which
authentication is evaded without needing to attack a smart vehicle
itself. They are a recurrent problem in practice. In this paper, we
formulate the necessary relay resilience settings for strengthening
authentication and key derivation and achieving the secure design
and efficient implementation of cryptographic protocols based on
universal composability, which allows the modular design and anal-
ysis of cryptographic protocols. We introduce Crypto-Chain, a relay
resilience framework that extends Kusters’s universal composition
theorem on a fixed number of protocol systems to prevent bypass
of cryptographic operations and avoid implementation errors. Our
framework provides an ideal crypto-chain functionality that sup-
ports several cryptographic primitives. Furthermore, we provide
an ideal functionality for mutual authentication and key deriva-
tion in Crypto-Chain by which cryptographic protocols can use
cryptographic operations, knowledge about the computation time
of the operations, and cryptographic timestamps to ensure relay
resilience. As a proof of concept, we first propose and implement
a mutual authentication and key derivation protocol (MKD) that
confirms the efficiency and relay resilience capabilities of Crypto-
Chain and then apply Crypto-Chain to fix two protocols used in
smart vehicles, namely Megamos Crypto and Hitag-AES/Pro.

1 INTRODUCTION
Smart vehicles are susceptible to relay attacks [14] by which an
active adversary initiates communication between two devices or
users to bypass security defences or recover secret cryptographic
keys. A number of cryptographic protocols such as Megamos
Crypto [5, 36] used in smart vehicles have been shown to be vulner-
able to relay attacks (see, e.g., [32]) because of weak authentication
and/or cryptographic keys. Stronger key derivation schemes and
authentication protocols have thus been proposed for mitigating
such attacks [25, 35, 39]. However, such schemes and protocols have
vulnerabilities such as lack of key update and randomization, use
of pre-established shared secret keys, and use of unreliable timing
information via the inability to verify and validate the computation
time of cryptographic operations. These imply that smart vehicles
rely on insecure cryptographic protocols. An adversary can bypass
the security defences of a car to open the door locks of the car
[36]. Note that in what follow we use the term “user” to refer to a
smart vehicle device like a smart sensor and therefore the “user”
and “device” terms are often used interchangeably.
Cryptographic protocols have proven important in mitigating
relay attacks in smart vehicles. For example, in the wake of relay
vulnerability disclosures in the Megamos Crypto, the community
reacted by either proposing key derivation schemes or authentica-
tion protocols [34], [12]. However, our research shows that when
an authentication protocol is not properly integrated with a key
derivation scheme, relay attacks can still be carried out, for exam-
ple, by deriving shared secret keys between unauthenticated users.
Thus, the lack of intertwining key derivation scheme and authen-
tication protocols opens opportunities for relay attacks. However,
such integration must be carefully designed to avoid relying on
weak cryptographic primitives and prevent the bypassing of cryp-
tographic operations that support relay resilience.
Surprisingly, there has been very little formal workaround inter-
twining key derivation schemes and authentication protocols (with
the support of the computation time of cryptographic operations
and cryptographic timestamps) in modern relay resilience solutions
for smart vehicles. Recent approaches either provide key derivation
schemes (based on pre-stored passwords or pre-established shared
secret keys) or authentication protocols for relay resilience [25, 38]

but not both. Other work has focused on the implementation of at-
tacks and provided some countermeasures such as access control re-
strictions and generation of secret keys [14, 36]. All such approaches
neither guarantee relay resilience nor can protect from certain relay
attacks that can occur when an unauthenticated user derives a key.
This is a major issue because lack of authentication is fertile ground
for relay attacks. Recent relay attacks have shown the exploitation
of unauthenticated users supporting unauthenticated key deriva-
tion or negotiation. In this work, we aim to address these issues
by investigating the problem of relay resilience in cryptographic
protocols of smart vehicles and providing a novel relay resilience
solution using integrated cryptographic operations, knowledge of
computation time of the operations, and cryptographic timestamps
based on universal composability [21, 23], which allows the modu-
lar design of complex cryptographic protocols (see Section 4.1 for a
description of cryptographic timestamps).

1.1 Motivating Example
We start with a motivating example. Consider the Megamos Crypto
authentication protocol [34] in smart cars for negotiating an output
from a pseudo-random function (PRF) family for authentication
as shown in Figure 1. In the first message, IDA (say, an electronic
vehicle immobilizer) presents a random number and one part of
its PRF output; in the second message, IDB (say, a transponder car
key) indicates one part of its PRF output. The goal of this protocol
′ so that
is to compute (X , Y) and (X
IDB authenticates its identity to IDA. The Megamos Crypto suc-
ceeds under normal circumstances. However, consider a scenario
where an adversary I is using relay attack devices DI .1 and DI .2
(for capturing low frequency (LF) or radio frequency (RF) signals)
located between IDA and IDB and IDA sends the first message to
IDB. This leads to a relay attack (see Figure 2), where I can use
DI .1 to receive the signal from IDA and transmit it to DI .2 and
further use DI .2 to transmit the signal to IDB and compromise the
connection between IDA and IDB.
′) and verify that Y = Y
A few techniques have been adopted by protocol designers to mit-
igate such attacks. We identified three common approaches based
on a review of widely deployed protocols. The first approach, ex-
emplified by Hitag-AES/Pro [31] from NXP, is to use a proprietary
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit algorithm during
authentication. The second approach relies on a password pre-
stored in the memory of a device and is best exemplified by Atmel’s
ATA5795C [3]. The third approach relies on a pre-established shared
secret key and is best exemplified by the Hitag-AES/Pro. All these
approaches have various advantages and disadvantages. For exam-
ple, Hitag-AES/Pro fails to use PRF during authentication and is
thus prone to relay attacks. Inputs of authentication features in
Megamos Crypto also lead to relay attack. Besides, ATA5792 relies
solely on pre-stored password which leads to eavesdropping of
exchanged data. Furthermore, the protocols are not secure in arbi-
trary adversarial environments, i.e., they lack universal composition
properties [6], [18].
1.2 Overview of our approach
We give a definition of relay resilience that models the intuitive and
desirable property for cryptographic protocols such as Megamos
Figure 2: Relay Attacks on Megamos Crypto authentication
protocol.
Crypto: To mitigate relay attack on a particular protocol, it is suffi-
cient to chain all cryptographic operations and prove the validity of
the computation time of cryptographic operations and cryptographic
timestamps. Our work builds on the definition of strong simulata-
bility in the universal composability and composition theorem of
Kusters [21, 22] used to model a fixed number of protocol systems in
the universal composability model. In a protocol system, users can
bypass cryptographic operations and still be able to continue a pro-
tocol execution. As a result, cryptographic operations to mitigate
relay attacks may not be executed. Our solution is to incorporate
relay resilience in the definition to ensure that (i) the user or an
adversary cannot force the execution of preferred cryptographic
operations and that (ii) a universally composable relay resilience
guarantee is established.
We consider mutual multi-factor authentication and key ex-
change between users. These users each have their own identities
and can express knowledge of computation time of cryptographic
operations and cryptographic timestamps and show their intent
to negotiate a shared secret session key. The factors used for au-
thentication include the identity of a user, ephemeral random value,
ephemeral public and private keys, and a combination of these
factors. By ephemeral we mean that the values and keys are used
for a single protocol execution and discarded after completion of a
IDA and IDB share a secret k and use a pseudo-random function (PRF) family F (X,Y) = Fk (r) r,X(X’,Y’) = Fk (r) Y’Y = Y’?IDAIDBIDADI.1 DI.2 IDBLF Signal(r,X)Relayed LF Signal(r,X)LF Signal(r,X)(X,Y) = Fk (r) LF Signal(Y’)Relayed LF Signal(Y’)LF Signal(Y’)LF Signal(Y’)Y = Y’?(X’,Y’) = Fk (r) 440Crypto-Chain: A Relay Resilience Framework for Smart Vehicles

key derivation and usage. To formally define relay resilience, we in-
troduce relay protection cryptographic primitives, such as dynamic
multi-factor authentication (DMA), which operates on a user’s iden-
tity and attributes (such as ephemeral random values, timestamps,
and ephemeral public keys), and knowledge-based key exchange
(KKE), which operates on establishing an authenticated preshared
key based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange
and the user’s attributes. We expect relay resilience support from
the DMA and KKE primitives.
We also introduce a mutual authentication and key derivation
functionality that maps two users’ identities and attributes to derive
a shared secret session key and compute a cryptographic proof/a
cryptographic timestamp for negotiating an output and proving
the negotiation, respectively (see Section 4.1 for a description of
cryptographic proof). Intuitively, our definition says that a protocol
is relay secure if two users, starting from their attributes and knowl-
edge of computation time of cryptographic operations satisfying
DMA and KKE to a commonly established timestamp, can only ne-
gotiate a shared secret session key determined by the functionality,
even in the presence of an adversary.
We adopt the following approach to apply our definition to
real-world protocols in smart vehicles. Rather than analyzing the
entire protocol, we first extract the authentication procedure and/or
key derivation procedure which capture the main relay-protection
mechanisms of the protocol. Then, we prove that either or both
procedures are complete for relay security.
1.3 Summary of our contributions
To the best of our knowledge, Crypto-Chain is the first frame-
work to simultaneously offer dynamic multi-factor mutual authen-
tication and key derivation with integrated cryptographic opera-
tions, knowledge of computation time of the operations, and cryp-
tographic timestamps for relay resilience in smart vehicles. Our
primary contribution is a novel relay resilience framework, i.e.,
Crypto-Chain, for smart vehicles. We devise a methodology to ana-
lyze the relay security of complex protocols by analyzing only the
authentication and/or key derivation procedures of the protocol.
More specifically, our contributions are as follows: (I) We extend
Kusters’s theorem that handles concurrent composition of a fixed
number of protocol systems to handle chainings of cryptographic
operations. (II) We present an ideal crypto-chain functionality FCC
that uses our new theorem and supports several cryptographic
primitives, such as DMA and KKE. (III) We propose and prove
a realization PCC of FCC. (IV) We propose an ideal functionality
for mutual authentication and key derivation FMK D. (V) We use
Crypto-Chain, which consists of FCC and FMK D, to construct the
first mutual authentication and key derivation protocol (MKD)
based on DMA and KKE for relay resilience in smart vehicles. We
further implement and analyse MKD. (VI) We describe and mitigate
relay vulnerabilities in Megamos Crypto and Hitag-AES/Pro.

2 UNIVERSAL COMPOSABILITY
In this section, we briefly recall the general notion of universal com-
posability, the IITM model [21, 23] with responsive environments
from [6], and the Kusters’s composition theorem. In universal com-
posability models, we have real and ideal protocols/functionalities.
An ideal protocol, also known as ideal functionality, represents the
desired behaviour and intended security properties of a protocol.
The real protocol, also known as real functionality, represents the
protocol to design and analyze and should be at least as secure as
the ideal protocol, i.e., it realizes the ideal protocol. For the ideal
protocol, there exists an ideal adversary or a simulator while a
real adversary exists for the real protocol, such that there is no
