"B": "This strategy will increase the data size being monitored, making it easier to detect exfiltration.",
"C": "Focusing on file extensions will help in identifying all the encrypted data before exfiltration.",
"D": "File extension monitoring is the most comprehensive method for detecting data archival and should be prioritized."
