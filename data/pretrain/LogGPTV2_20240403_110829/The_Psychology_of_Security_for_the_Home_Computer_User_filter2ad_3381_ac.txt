To ensure online safety, it is essential to understand and categorize user behaviors as adaptive (such as requesting the removal of personal information from marketing lists), maladaptive (like avoiding online shopping altogether), risky (engaging in actions that increase online risk), and protective (implementing security measures to mitigate risk). The goal is to identify specific factors that can guide individuals away from risky behaviors and towards more adaptive and protective ones, potentially informing the development of training programs.

A study involving 449 online shoppers, recruited from a commercial opt-in consumer panel, was conducted to assess three key factors and four types of behaviors. The factors evaluated were:

- **Perceived Threat**: "I am concerned about having my identity stolen while shopping online." (Rated on a 5-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree)
- **Perceived Likelihood**: "How likely is it for oneâ€™s identity to be stolen while shopping online?" (Rated on a 5-point scale from very unlikely to very likely)
- **Self-Efficacy**: "I am skilled at avoiding dangers while shopping online." (Rated on a 5-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree)

The behaviors assessed included:
- **Adaptive Behavior**: "In the past year, have you asked an online business to remove your name and address from any lists they use for marketing purposes?" (Yes or no)
- **Maladaptive Behavior**: "In the past year, have you avoided online shopping to avoid risk?" (Yes or no)

Risky and protective behaviors were evaluated by asking participants to select from a list of 16 protective behaviors (e.g., installing virus checkers, using anonymizers) and 33 risky behaviors (e.g., saving passwords on computers, downloading unknown files from social networking sites).

Regression analysis of the survey results revealed that self-efficacy had significant positive effects on adaptive and protective behaviors, and significant negative effects on maladaptive and risky behaviors. This indicates that users who felt confident in their abilities were more likely to take protective actions. Perceived likelihood also had a significant effect on adaptive behavior, but perceived threat did not. Conversely, perceived threat had a significant positive effect on maladaptive behaviors, while perceived likelihood did not. Neither factor significantly influenced risky or protective behaviors. These findings suggest that online shoppers are more responsive to the probability of threats rather than the mere presence of threats.

Byrne et al. [15] explored how the presence of specific internet threats affects users' perceptions of vulnerability and risk. The threats examined were:
- **Availability**: Computer resources are improperly made inaccessible.
- **Integrity**: Data on the computer is modified without the user's authorization.
- **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information is revealed without the user's approval.
- **Unwitting Accomplice**: Users unintentionally spread the threat to others.

Two levels of each threat (low and high) were represented. The study used policy-capturing, where 104 subjects judged cues across 16 vignettes. Participants were recruited from two age groups: young adults (18-29 years) and older adults (50+ years), due to their perceived vulnerability to security threats. They were asked about their basic and extensive computer knowledge, self-perception of computer knowledge, frequency of computer usage, and prior exposure to privacy invasions. The experiment was conducted as an online survey, presenting participants with vignettes corresponding to the four threats and asking them to rate their perceived level of risk and vulnerability.

Hierarchical linear modeling of the data showed that all four threats increased ratings of risk and vulnerability. Participants with more extensive computer knowledge gave more weight to integrity threats when rating risk, and those with higher self-perceived computer knowledge gave more weight to integrity threats when assessing vulnerability. This suggests that a better understanding of computers may lead to a better appreciation of the consequences of risky actions.

Facebook, often considered a service that poses significant privacy risks, was evaluated in a 2007 report by Privacy International [31]. Facebook was one of seven companies rated as having "substantial and comprehensive privacy threats" (Google fared worse). Studies by Debatin et al. [32] and Govani and Pashley [33] highlight the importance of considering both the perceived risks and benefits of social networking when encouraging secure behavior.

In Debatin et al.'s [32] study, 119 U.S. undergraduates completed an online survey. The survey covered Facebook setup and habits, privacy practices, the role of friends, perceived benefits, and potential risks. Results showed that 91% of participants were familiar with privacy settings, and 77% restricted their profile privacy. However, restrictions were often weak, with many participants having large friend networks and revealing substantial personal information. A paired-samples t-test indicated a statistically significant difference (p < .001) between perceived benefits (higher) and risks. Participants were more likely to perceive risks to others and change their privacy settings if they personally experienced a privacy invasion.

Govani and Pashley [33] surveyed 50 Carnegie Mellon University undergraduates about their Facebook usage and privacy settings. Despite being informed about privacy settings, there was little change in the contact information included in their profiles. This suggests that some services are seen as so essential that users will accept the associated risks.

**V. Defensive Security Actions**

Threats to personal security and privacy can be managed through preventive actions or interventions when problems arise. We divide the discussion of users' actions and attitudes into these two activities.

**A. Efforts to Avoid Security Breaches**

Surveys show mixed results regarding actions taken to avoid security problems. A U.K. survey found high installation rates of security software (93% with antivirus, 87% with firewalls, 77% with antispyware, and 60% with antispam), but lower rates of frequent updates (37%-63% updated weekly) [8]. A 2006 Michigan telephone survey [18] found that only 4% of respondents claimed to have no virus protection, 50% set it up themselves, and 41% had it set up by their ISP or others. Additionally, 46% always read privacy statements, while 25% never or hardly ever read them. A 2010 U.S. study [7] reported lower security software usage and a significant discrepancy between self-reported (58%) and actual (37%) installation rates. These studies suggest that many users know they should take action but do not follow through.

An access control study [28] found that 30 out of 33 participants used security measures such as separate accounts, different passwords, file encryption, physical presence during file examination, device separation, hiding sensitive files, and deleting sensitive data. The authors noted a mismatch between participants' mental models and the reality of access control, particularly the belief that physical location is crucial. Participants desired fine-grained groupings, read/write access, logging, permission requests, and access based on physical presence. Similar desires were found in another access control study of 20 home users [34].

A study on folk models of security [16] examined how these models related to the security advice participants followed. The 12 security actions included antivirus software use, other security software, email, web browsing, and computer maintenance. All groups agreed on the importance of not clicking on email attachments. The 'Bad' virus group thought antivirus software and careful software downloads might be useful. The 'Buggy Software' group emphasized careful software downloads, regular backups, and keeping patches up to date. The 'Mischief' group stressed careful website visits and regular backups, and thought antivirus software, regular scans, and other security software might be helpful. The 'Crime' group prioritized antivirus activities, careful software downloads, keeping patches up to date, and turning off the computer when not in use. Two actions were ignored by all groups: disabling scripting in web and email, and using strong passwords. Wash recommended that education should focus not just on the appropriate actions but also on explaining why they are beneficial.

A model of home system administrators [35] combined the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and Diffusion of Innovation (DoI) to identify factors influencing the adoption of security protections. The proposed model included five categories of influences: user characteristics, risk tolerance, innovation characteristics, social consequences, and communication channels. The model was validated through a survey of 356 participants. Analysis showed that self-efficacy of security skills, self-efficacy of computer skills, risk awareness, suitability, direct experience, subjective norms, and vendors were significant factors. The lack of influence of other factors may be due to the participants' existing experience and motivation for maintaining security.

Milne et al.'s study [14] on online shoppers' risk perception collected data on protective and risky behaviors. High levels of defensive actions were reported, including virus checker installation (86%), complex passwords (85%), spyware scanning (84%), clearing browser cache (81%), checking secure forms (81%), and opting out of third-party information sharing (80%). Risky behaviors were less common: saved passwords (56%), saved credit card information (51%), and social networking site use (45%).

These studies collectively provide insights into the factors that influence online behavior and the effectiveness of various security measures, highlighting the need for targeted education and awareness campaigns.
