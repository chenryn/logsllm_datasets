munication protocol
The protocol is based on a dynamic redundancy scheme.
In this scheme a message is only retransmitted upon the de-
tection of its loss. Such a scheme needs the explicit recog-
nition of communication failures and an acknowledgment
strategy that reports the status of a transmission.
The protocol is based on the following fault assumptions
about the wireless network [8]: (a) if a message is deliv-
ered (during the CFP), it is delivered correctly and within
a ﬁxed time bound (tm), (b) messages may be lost, possi-
bly in an asymmetric way, i.e. some stations may receive
a broadcast message while others do not. In any case, the
number of consecutive losses of the same message is as-
sumed to be bounded by the so-called omission degree OD,
(c) the AP is reliable, i.e. it is not subject to any kind of er-
ror and ﬁnally (d) stations may suffer from crash failures or
leave the reach of the AP.
The group communication protocol is structured into
rounds and it is assumed that there is a maximum number
nmax of stations in a group and that N (cid:1) nmax is the cur-
rent size of the group. A round is composed of a series of
slots, one for each station in the group, where each slot con-
sists of a triple of message transmissions; a polling mes-
sage from the AP to the station, a broadcast request mes-
sage from the station to the AP and a broadcast message by
which the AP sends the user message of the sending station
to all stations. Each round is identiﬁed by a unique round

number, starting from 0 and incremented by 1 at the begin-
ning of each new round. The AP polls each station of the
group exactly once in each round, and polls the stations al-
ways in the same order, sending them the round number
in the polling message. After being polled, station s (de-
noted as originator in the following) sends a broadcast re-
quest message to the AP. This message is composed of an
acknowledgment ﬁeld, a local sequence number and a user
message m. The acknowledgment scheme implies that ex-
actly one round after broadcasting a user message of a cer-
tain station, the AP is able to decide whether each group
member has received the user message or not. For details
we refer to [22] and [17].
3.2. Further enhancement of the protocol
The improvement of the protocol proposed in [22] aims
at a further decrease in the latency of real-time messages by
reducing the maximum number of message retransmissions
from OD to a user-speciﬁed number lower than OD. This
number is the so-called resilience degree, res. With this re-
duction of the number of retries full reliability of the pro-
tocol can no longer be guaranteed under the assumptions
about the network (as long as res OD : The probability that a decision message (i.e.
a message issued by the AP to commit or abort the delivery
of a broadcast message) is not received by at least one sta-
tion in the group, within TCF P (duration of the CFP phase).
This measure represents an estimate of the probability for
the protocol to fail in an undetected and undesirable way
with possible catastrophic consequences on the system and
its users. Therefore, this probability should be sufﬁciently
low.
PUM : The probability that the AP does not receive
acknowledgments for a user message by all the stations
within res retransmissions within TCF P . In this case, the
AP broadcasts to all stations in the group the decision not
to deliver that message to their applications. In other words,
PUM is the probability that some station in the group has
not acknowledged a user message sent by the AP after res
retransmissions. This property gives an indication to which
extent the validity property is violated.
4. A Dependability Model
In [8], a model is developed that covers relevant aspects
of the protocol and its environment that are necessary to
analyse the dependability measures of interest. A single
model is used to analyse several dependability measures by
varying the values of its parameters.
4.1. Fading model
In modelling the environment, the interference between
different versions of the transmitted signal and the Doppler
shift caused by the relative motion of receiving and send-
ing stations, has been taken into account. Both effects cause
the so-called signal fading phenomenon. The probability of
message loss resulting from fading signals has been ap-
proximated by the ﬁrst-order discrete time Markov chain
(DTMC) [24] depicted in Fig. 1. The DTMC has two states,
S and F , standing for (previous) success and failure of a
communication respectively. If the previous communication
has been successful, with probability p the next communi-
cation will also be successful. With probability 1 − p, the
next communication will be a failure. If the previous com-
munication has failed, then with probability q the next com-
munication fails, and with probability 1 − q it is success-
ful. This behaviour can be presented as a transition proba-
bility matrix in a standard way. The probability of success
or failure of a number of consecutive message losses (suc-
cess) can be obtained by matrix multiplication. The param-

eters p and q have been derived considering the communi-
cation between the AP and the stations as Rayleigh fading
channels and using experimental data available to calculate
the approximate values [8]. In particular, p and q are func-
tions of the steady state probability that a communication
fails (PE) and the normalized Doppler frequency. For de-
tails we refer to [8, 24].

4.2. Station model
The fading model has been integrated into the model of
a station deﬁned using the SAN formalism [21] which is
shown in Fig. 2. SANs are a high-level modelling formal-
ism for the speciﬁcation of dependability and performabil-
ity models. SAN models consist of four primitive objects:
places, activities, input gates and output gates. Places rep-
resent the state of the system and are marked by tokens, like
in Petri nets. Activities represent transitions or actions of the
system. Input gates are used to control the enabling of ac-
tivities, and output gates are used to change the state of the
model on completion of an activity.
Let us brieﬂy explain the SAN model. The place P OLL
models that the station is polled by the AP. Initially it has
one token. The input gate chk enables the timed activ-
ity nprb only if there is a token in place P OLL and no
token at place F AIL. If this condition is satisﬁed, chk re-
moves the token from place P OLL. The exact interpreta-
tion that is given to the failing of a station depends on the
dependability measure that is analysed. For the analysis of
PD>OD a station fails if it missed more than OD consec-
utive decision messages within TCF P . In the case of PUM
it fails if it missed more than res consecutive user mes-
sages within TCF P . The timed activity nprb (probabilistic
broadcast) models the performance aspects of the wire-
less network and forms the central part of the model.
Model for the analysis of PD>OD. When the model
is used to analyse property PD>OD, the time distribution
function is chosen to be exponential with a rate being the re-
ciprocal of the duration of one slot, i.e. the sum of the tran-
sition time of one polling message, a broadcast request mes-
sage and a broadcast message. Let T P be the mean time re-
quired for the polling message to be transferred from the
AP to a station, and T M the same for a broadcast mes-
sage. Then the exponential distribution rate of a slot is
1/(2 ∗ T M + T P ).
The timed activity nprb has two cases, represented as
two small circles attached to the hollow oval in Fig. 2. The
probability distribution of the two cases is deﬁned by the
case distribution and may also depend on the marking of
the network at the moment of completion of the activity.
In this model, the distribution depends on the marking of
place SU CCESS. A token in place SU CCESS means
that the previous triple of polling, broadcast request and
broadcast messages, has been a success. We obtain the fad-
ing characteristics as the outcome of the product of three
matrices M(cid:1).M.M . Here M(cid:1)
represents the matrix deﬁn-
ing the fading characteristics of the short polling message,
with its characteristic probabilities p(cid:1)
, and M deﬁnes
the fading characteristics of a broadcast message with its re-
spective probabilities. Let P and Q be the resulting proba-
bilities of this matrix multiplication, i.e. P is the probabil-
ity in that resulting matrix of the self-loop from state S to
itself, 1 − P is the probability in that matrix of the tran-
sition from S to F , etc. The probabilities associated with
the two cases in the timed activity nprb are then derived
from the DTMC in Fig. 1 where p and q are now P and Q.
So case 1, denoting a broadcast failure, connected to output
gate F AIL BC becomes 1− P and case 2, denoting a suc-
cessful broadcast, becomes P . If there is no token on place
SU CCESS, the probabilities for the two cases are Q and
1 − Q, respectively.
and q(cid:1)
The output gate F AIL BC removes any token from
place SU CCESS, increments the number of tokens on
place COU N T ER by one, and if the number of tokens on
COU N T ER exceeds the omission degree OD, it puts a to-
ken on place F AIL. Otherwise, it puts a token on place
P OLL, modelling that the station is ready for the next
communication (triple). The COU N T ER represents the
number of consecutive failed communications for a given
station. The output gate SU CC BC changes the state of
the model after a successful broadcast has taken place. It
puts a token on place SU CCESS, resets COU N T ER to
zero (i.e. removes all its tokens) and puts a token on place
P OLL. Initially, there is one token on place SU CCESS
and on place P OLL, and all other places are empty.
UltraSAN provides a mechanism for replicating a sin-
gle station. This allows for the easy generation of a model
with N stations that may share places. In this case the sta-
tions share place F AIL.
Model for the analysis of PUM . The model used for
analysing property PUM is the same as that for PD>OD ex-
cept for the values of P and Q and the rate of the exponen-
tial distribution of the timed activity. In fact, for PUM we

are interested in the probability that a user message is not
received by a station within res retransmissions and within
the duration of the CF P . This means that we need to set the
rate of the timed activity to the reciprocal of the mean dura-
tion of one round, i.e. to 1/(N ∗ (2 ∗ T M + T P )) where N
is the number of stations in the group, which is equal to the
number of slots in a round. The probabilities P and Q have
now to be based on a round as well. They can be obtained
as the result of the matrix multiplication [M(cid:1).M.M]N in the
same way as for the model for PD>OD.
5. Model Checking Properties
The format of the model ﬁle generated by Ultra-
SAN is different from that required by the ETMCC model
checker [13], but contains all the information needed to con-
struct the proper model ﬁle for ETMCC.
The association between the markings of the SAN model
and the CTMC facilitates setting up a proper labelling ﬁle
that is also part of the input for the ETMCC model checker.
The labelling ﬁle deﬁnes the atomic propositions that hold
in the various states of the CTMC. The atomic propositions
are used to state interesting properties of the model in a pre-
cise and formal way using CSL. We developed two pro-
grams to transform the model ﬁle and the marking ﬁle gen-
