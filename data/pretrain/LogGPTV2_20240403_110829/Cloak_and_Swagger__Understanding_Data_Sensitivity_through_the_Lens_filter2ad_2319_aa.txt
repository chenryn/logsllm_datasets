Abstract—Most of what we understand about data sensitivity
is through user self-report (e.g., surveys); this paper is the ﬁrst to
use behavioral data to determine content sensitivity, via the clues
that users give as to what information they consider private or
sensitive through their use of privacy enhancing product features.
We perform a large-scale analysis of user anonymity choices
during their activity on Quora, a popular question-and-answer
site. We identify categories of questions for which users are more
likely to exercise anonymity and explore several machine learning
approaches towards predicting whether a particular answer will
be written anonymously. Our ﬁndings validate the viability of
the proposed approach towards an automatic assessment of data
sensitivity, show that data sensitivity is a nuanced measure that
should be viewed on a continuum rather than as a binary concept,
and advance the idea that machine learning over behavioral data
can be effectively used in order to develop product features that
can help keep users safe.
I. INTRODUCTION
As the world moves to an ever-connected paradigm, online
interactions are increasingly shaping how we interact with
others and are perceived by them. The rise of services such
as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and YouTube that empower
individuals to share their thoughts and experiences instantly and
easily have opened the ﬂood gates of user-generated content.
This content deeply inﬂuences many aspects of our culture:
from the creation of new dance styles [1] to the way breaking
news are reported [2], to the rise of self-published authors [3].
A risk of this always-on sharing culture is that it may push
users to share or express things that can harm them. The web is
full of stories of careless or mistaken sharing of information or
opinions that led to embarrassment or harm, from getting ﬁred
because of ranting about job frustrations [4] to public relations
catastrophes due to “tweeting” under the inﬂuence [5].
The approach taken by online services to address this
challenge to date has taken two directions: the ﬁrst one deﬁnes
what content users may consider sensitive and attempts to
prevent its sharing without explicit conﬁrmation. The second
one introduces granular privacy controls in order to empower
users to choose the desired privacy settings for each item they
share. Both face scalability issues. Hand-crafted or survey-
based deﬁnitions of sensitivity can hardly keep up with
differences in preferences and expectations due to the context
in which they are being applied or due to cultural, geographic,
and demographic factors [6]. The second approach may be
overwhelming due to diversity of privacy choices available.
In this work we explore whether it is possible to perform
a large-scale behavioral data analysis, rather than to rely on
surveys and self-report, in order to understand what topics
users consider sensitive. Our goal is to help online service
providers design policies and develop product features that
promote user engagement and safer sharing and increase users’
trust in online services’ privacy practices.
Concretely, we perform analysis and data mining of the
usage of privacy features on one of the largest question-and-
answer sites, Quora [7], in order to identify topics potentially
considered sensitive by its users. The analysis takes advantage
of the Quora privacy feature that allows users to choose whether
to answer each question anonymously or with their names
attached. To learn what topics are potentially sensitive for Quora
users, we analyze 587,653 Quora questions and 1,223,624
answers that span over 61,745 topics and 27,697 contexts. We
ﬁnd evidence in support of sensitivity of the oft-cited topics,
such as those related to race, religion, sex, drugs, and sexual
orientation [8], [9], [10], [11], and discover topic groups that
are not typically included in such lists, many of them related
to emotions, relationships, personal experiences, education,
career, and insider knowledge. We use the obtained knowledge
to build a machine learning model that is able to predict
the sensitivity of particular questions with 80.4% accuracy
and anonymity of answers with 88% accuracy, demonstrating
that data on users’ use of privacy-enhancing features can be
used to develop policies and product features that enable safer
sharing. Finally, we run a 1,500 person user survey on the US
population via Google Consumer surveys [12] and compare
our user activity-driven inferences with those obtained via a
self-report. As far as we know, we are the ﬁrst to use large-
scale data analysis of users’ privacy-related activity in order to
infer content sensitivity and leverage the data towards building
a machine learning model designed to help service providers
design better privacy controls and foster engagement without
a fear of over-sharing.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in
Section II we review the current approaches towards deﬁning
content sensitivity and concerns related to data sharing. In
Section III we introduce Quora and its features, and describe
the dataset we collected based on it. In Sections IV and V we
present and discuss the results of our data analyses based on
users’ usage of Quora’s anonymity features in terms of topics

and words indicative of sensitivity. In Section VI we present
the results of our attempts to predict question-level and answer-
level anonymity based on their content. Section VII discusses
limitations of our approach and the challenges of relying on
a purely data-driven analysis for identifying sensitivity, and
presents a comparison of our ﬁndings with those based on an
online survey. Section VIII describes related work on inferring
users’ privacy preferences, privacy risks, and efforts related to
helping users minimize regret from sharing. We conclude by
summarizing our contributions in Section IX.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section we discuss the notions of content sensitivity
adopted by several popular online services and data protection
authorities, the potential negative consequences of over-sharing,
and the positive impact that product features cognizant of data
sensitivity can have on engagement with a product.
A. What is Sensitive Content?
There is no universally adopted deﬁnition of what constitutes
sensitive content. Each online service provider deﬁnes sensitive
data independently, describes it in the service’s privacy policy or
Terms of Service, and then develops functionalities or policies
to observe this deﬁnition. For example, Google’s privacy policy
deﬁnes sensitive personal information as “conﬁdential medical
facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs
or sexuality” [8] and Google does not associate cookies or
anonymous identiﬁers with sensitive advertising categories as
“those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health”
[13]. Facebook’s advertising guidelines prohibit targeting users
based on their personal characteristics from the categories of
“race or ethnic origin; religion or philosophical belief; age;
sexual orientation or sexual life; gender identity; disability
or medical condition (including physical or mental health);
ﬁnancial status or information; membership in a trade union;
and criminal record” [10]. Similarly, Microsoft’s advertising
policy states that ads cannot be related to prohibited and
restricted categories such as adult content, ﬁrearms and
weapons, gambling, surveillance equipment, suffering, violence
and exploitation, dating/personals, health, political and religious
content, etc. [9]. Quora considers adult content to be sensitive,
as evidenced by their decision to disable the views feature
(Section III) on questions related to that type of content [14].
Legal and data protection authorities have also proposed
deﬁnition of sensitive content that is similar but not identical
to those of online service providers. For example, CNIL [15],
the French administrative regulatory body whose mission is
focused on data privacy, deﬁnes sensitive data as “any type
of data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, or
data concerning health or sex life” [11]. A directive of the
European Parliament delineates special categories of data for
whom stricter processing laws apply and includes in it: racial
or ethnic origins, views on politics, labour relations or religion,
health, sex life, penalties, convictions and national ID [16].
User perceptions of content sensitivity may differ from the
categories deﬁned by online services and policy makers. Privacy
experts call for deﬁnitions that would allow the concept of
sensitive data to “evolve over time and [depend] on the context,
technologies, the use made of the data and even the individuals
themselves”, highlighting that most current deﬁnitions are
restricted to “data that may give rise to discrimination”,
and that “even trivial data can become sensitive owing to
the way it accumulates on the internet and the way in
is processed” [6]. The goal of this work is to
which it
deepen our understanding and capture the nuances of users’
content sensitivity perception through a data-driven study of
users’ privacy-related actions. The data-driven approach could
complement that based on user surveys and serve as a more
scalable way to understand the evolution and differences in
perception over time and across cultures.
B. Dangers of Over-Sharing
Social networks such as Facebook and Google+ offer controls
to limit the visibility of one’s posts to a speciﬁc user group.
However, users often make mistakes when posting or sharing
information that can lead to trouble. For example, sharing
location information on Twitter facilitated a successful bur-
glary [17], and inadvertent exposure of sexuality on Facebook
resulted in threats to sever family ties [18]. Mistakes or
unforeseen consequences of sharing can also cause discomfort
or embarrassment [19] and there’s ample evidence that users
often regret their online postings [20].
Furthermore, data shared online has become one of the
most-often checked sources of information about a person. For
example, colleges routinely assess the social network proﬁles
of their applicants [21], employers look at potential candidates’
online proﬁles [22], and people of both genders research their
potential dates online [23]. Thus the potential consequences
of sharing mistakes (due to lack of understanding of sharing
impact, inattentiveness, lack of privacy controls, or spur-of-the-
moment decisions) are constantly increasing, which is starting
to cause fear of engaging, sharing, or expressing one’s opinion
online [24], [25].
C. Impact of Better Privacy Tools and Features
On the other hand, development of many privacy-enhancing
technologies and product features has enabled many people
to engage and share online with more conﬁdence and less
risk [26], [27], [28], [29]. Recently, smart privacy features
have become one of the core enablers of success for social
networks and sharing services [30], [31].
In particular, though anonymity as a feature can reduce
accountability and accuracy of information shared [32], it often
enables people to be more open about their views [33], increases
the effectiveness of leadership and group transactions [34], and
enables user engagement [35].
Overall, a better understanding of user privacy fears and
sensitivity of the content shared, would enable many online
service providers to improve their products and engagement
with their products. A feature on Facebook, LinkedIn, or

Google+ that double-checks the user’s intention to share
a drunken rant publicly or with their work colleagues, or
alerts them that a post would likely make others aware of
their religious or sexual preference, could help avoid sharing
mistakes and build user conﬁdence in sharing and engaging
online. A feature that double-checks the intention to share
a sensitive piece of information, with sensitivity evaluated
from a user’s perspective rather than a legal or one-size-ﬁts-all
perspective, would be even more impactful.
III. QUORA
We use Quora [7], a popular question-and-answer site, in
order to perform our proof-of-concept data-driven analysis of
user perceptions of content sensitivity. Quora is a particularly
fertile data source for such an analysis since it has a rich and
prominent set of privacy features actively utilized by its user
base when sharing about or expressing interest in a particular
topic. We describe Quora functionality, its core privacy features,
incentives for sharing anonymously or non-anonymously, and
the characteristics of Quora as a study dataset next.
A. About Quora
Quora [7] is a question-and-answer website founded in 2009,
somewhat similar to the once-popular Yahoo! Answers [36]. It
has functionality that enables users to ask and answer questions
on a variety of topics, as well as to “follow” or subscribe to
updates on activity by other users or activity by all users related
to a particular topic.
An example Quora page is shown in Figure 1, with several
core features, present in each question page, highlighted. Every
Quora Question page has three main information blocks that we
are interested in – Question, Answer and Follower blocks. The
Question Block has ﬁve pieces of information. It has two sets
of tags (Quora Context and Quora Topics), the actual question
text, additional question details and comments. Quora Context
and Quora Topics are highlighted by a (violet) rectangular box
at the top of Figure 1. Each question is assigned at most one
context and zero or more topics by Quora moderators. Users
can choose to follow individual topics or questions, in which
case they receive notiﬁcations about new activity related to
them and their follow choice gets shared with other users.
Each question has zero or more answers. Each answer has
four pieces of information – the answerer details, a partial
list of voters (who upvoted the answer), the answer text
and comments. The answerer ﬁeld contains the name of the
person who answered and a short description of the person
(highlighted by green box in Figure 1). If the answerer prefers
to answer anonymously, she can use the Make Anonymous
option available above the answer text box (highlighted by a
red box in Figure 1). When the Make Anonymous option is
exercised, others see Anonymous instead of the name in the
answerer ﬁeld (as highlighted by the red box in Figure 1).
Every question has zero or more followers, who are interested
in the question and would like to be notiﬁed about new
answers being posted. A partial grid of followers (indicated by
their pictures) is provided at the bottom right of the question
webpage (highlighted in an orange rectangular box in Figure 1).
Only a max of 45 pictures are shown, even when the number of
followers is much higher for a question. Similar to the option
to answer anonymously, Quora provides an option to follow a
question anonymously. The anonymous question followers are
indicated by grey icons in the follower grid (as highlighted by
the last icon in the followers list in Figure 1).
For every question, Quora also keeps track of the number of
Quora users who viewed the question. The number of views is
shown to all users above the grid of followers (as highlighted
by a violet rectangular box at the bottom right in Figure 1).
Clicking on that number provides the list of Quora users who
viewed this particular Quora question.
B. Quora Privacy Features
Although Quora has a strict real-names policy [37], similar
to that of other online social networks such as Facebook and
Google+, it provides several privacy-related product features
that are core to its functionality and are heavily utilized by its
users [38]. Speciﬁcally, each user can choose whether to follow
a question anonymously or non-anonymously, and whether to
write an answer anonymously or non-anonymously by using the
Make Anonymous feature. Users are also provided an option to
hide their question views, so they are not listed in the user group
who viewed a particular question (however the shown view
count includes all page visits). Furthermore, Quora provides
protection to its users against crawlers using a feature called
Search Engine Privacy [39]. The default option is to Allow
search engines to index the name. If indexing is disallowed by
a user, Quora prevents crawlers, search engines, and other not-
logged in users from seeing that user’s proﬁle page information,
his activity and, renders any activity performed by that user to
be indistinguishable from anonymous user activity for anyone
except other logged in users.
C. Incentives for Anonymity and Non-Anonymity
Quora users describe several motivations for following and
answering questions anonymously [40]. Some users prefer not
to identify themselves in their answers when they relate to
personal experiences, or experiences of friends and family
members, or contain information about sensitive topics such
as medical history. Others answer anonymously to avoid em-
barrassing or unfavorable situations that their answer can lead
to [21], [22], [23], or to avoid trouble when sharing potentially
sensitive or conﬁdential information about companies about
which they have insider knowledge. Others, who are striving
to build a reputation in a certain domain, prefer to answer
anonymously and reveal their identity later if the answer gains
recognition or popularity, as indicated by up-votes, another
Quora feature. Finally, since Quora is akin to a social network
where people follow others, answering anonymously prevents
the answer from appearing in followers’ feeds.
There are several strong incentives for answering questions
with one’s real name, as pointed out in [41]. Providing one’s
identity along with an answer may lend it credibility [32],
as readers can verify the provided information with the help

of details provided in the answerer’s proﬁle. Non-anonymous
answers help build reputation, popularity, and social capital. It
also helps build new connections, and it is revealed that people
are using votes as social signals to draw attention of inﬂuential
people.
Irrespective of an individual’s reasons for answering anony-
mously or non-anonymously, one can argue that it is better
for the Quora eco-system if many answers are provided
non-anonymously. Such answers promote user interaction
and engagement, as non-anonymous answers appear in the
answerer’s followers feeds. Since users may take more care
when answering non-anonymously as they want to appear
knowledgeable, the quality of such content increases. Hence,
enabling users to share non-anonymously while avoiding
undesirable situations would be a desirable outcome for Quora.
D. Dataset Characteristics
We crawled the Quora website using our own custom crawler
during the period of August - October, 2012. We follow a
similar approach as outlined in [42] for crawling Quora. Our
crawler observed the Quora’s robots.txt as well as rate-limited
our access. Furthermore, in order to limit the request load,
we only crawled the Quora question pages, and omitted all
other pages, such as answer pages, follower pages, activity
pages, views pages, and user proﬁle pages. As a result, the
information we obtained about question followers is limited to
the followers listed at the bottom right of the Quora question
page (Figure 1), and does not include all question followers.
The question pages list up to 45 followers, and our manual
inspection suggests those are chosen at random (with caching).
Furthermore, we have observed that the answers of users who
have enabled the “Search Engine Privacy” feature on Quora
appear as “Anonymous” to non logged-in users, regardless of
whether that answer was written anonymously or not [39]. Since
our crawler did not possess the credentials of a logged in Quora
user, our dataset does not distinguish between answers that were
written anonymously and those that were labeled by Quora as
“Anonymous” due to users’ “Search Engine Privacy” settings,
which is an important limitation. We discuss the implications
of these crawl limitations in Sections IV-B2 and VII-A.
