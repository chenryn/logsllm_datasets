institutions that suffer from these attacks. Additional measure-
ments in the landscape, can also be enriched by a repository
of phishing kit ﬁngerprints. Similar to repositories for mal-
ware ﬁngerprints, the community – from hosting providers,
to volunteers and researchers – can contribute their analyses
on phishing kits, so to keep track of this pervasive phishing
tactic. In turn, standardization on how to describe phishing
kits, their tactics and detection methods is necessary before
such an exchange can be successful. The creation of such a
standard is a gap future work can ﬁll. In the meantime, our
system can be extended with (semi)automatic submission to
anti-phishing services and block lists, which would hopefully
lead to quicker responses.
11 Conclusions
In this paper we have presented the results of our investigation
of the Dutch phishing landscape. We designed an empirical
methodology to study phishing campaigns in the wild using
phishing kit ﬁngerprints. We leverage the fact that phishers
are using TLS certiﬁcates to capture the end-to-end life cycle
of phishing campaigns. We were able to ﬁnd 1,363 conﬁrmed
phishing domains that deploy such kits, in a four months time
period – with on average 31 phishing domains online every
day, waiting for victims to arrive. Most of these domains are
online for only 24 hours, but half of them (much) longer. Ex-
ternal validation with APWG data has shown that our method-
ology has the potential to detect phishing websites swiftly and
that it covers a complementary spectrum of phishing domains.
Additionally, we show that attackers have increased their abil-
ities to lure victims into disclosing their credentials by using
decoy pages, which do not directly demand credentials from
the victim but do so eventually. These decoy pages split the
target organization from the organization impersonated on the
phishing page, which allows for numerous possibilities for
attackers. Referring to the target organization in the domain
name is less prevailing, as regular words are more often used
to trick victims into clicking on a phishing link. Through a
combination of our analysis on the anatomy of phishing kits
and the crawls of phishing domains in the wild, we demon-
strate that the Dutch phishing landscape is less diverse than
expected and that many phishers are building their campaigns
on the same framework, uAdmin. The arrest of the developer
of this framework in February, 2021, and the corresponding
news coverage allows us to conclude that our ﬁndings are
also useful outside the Netherlands, as uAdmin is actively
used all around the world. Through both data analyses and
a real-world example, we have reconstructed a timeline of
the complete end-to-end life cycle of a typical phishing cam-
paign – proving that phishers move fast. In turn, these fast
moving campaigns require swift and decisive interventions.
We believe the insights of this work will help LEA and inter-
mediaries design faster responses to this ever evolving threat
and we encourage them to do a similar analysis of their local
phishing landscape.
