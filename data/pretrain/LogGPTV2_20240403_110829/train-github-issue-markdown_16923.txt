  * Electron Version: v2.0.2
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): Linux
  * Last known working Electron version:
**Expected Behavior**  
while using window's background property in electron API and CSS background
property I should get a similar result.
**Actual behavior**  
I set the window's background property with color `#141414` and also applied
`#141414` color to `html, body` tags with CSS but in the attached screenshot,
the result isn't what I expect.
**Note:** the top section is CSS colored and the bottom section is native
chromium background color. Also, this problem will occur while using
`--disable-gpu` flag and well my window is frameless and in Linux by selecting
a text object or something else and dragging it to out electron will crash.
