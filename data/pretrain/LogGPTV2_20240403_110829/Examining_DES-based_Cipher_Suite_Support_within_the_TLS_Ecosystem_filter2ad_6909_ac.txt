was officially deprecated by building our own active scanning tool
and focusing on DES-based ciphersuite support within the TLS
ecosystem. We found that nearly half of them can still successfully
establish an HTTPS connection using at least one DES cipher. We
also note the use of DES40 and anonymous ciphers, which can be
broken easily or enable man-in-the-middle attacks. Our further
analysis on hostnames and geographic information shows that the
use of DES-based ciphersuites are still popular among many ISP-like
organizations and the global TLS ecosystem in general.

Table 1: A breakdown of ciphers accepted by the investigated
domains, discussed in more detail in Section A.2. It should be
noted that an accepted cipher may be counted twice, such as
EXPORT-DES40 which will be counted as both an EXPORT
cipher and a DES40 cipher. In addition to the listed ciphers,
each domain also supported one DES56 cipher.

A APPENDIX
A.1 Procedure for Scanning Across Hosts
With the knowledge that running multiple ZGrab2 queries on a
server is expensive, we sought to decrease any undue burden our
automator might cause. Much of our efforts were inspired by the
recommended practices laid out by the authors of ZMap [19].
(1) Coordinate with local network admins: While we could
not gain permission from our university’s IT department to
perform a large-scale Internet scan from within the univer-
sity network, another university was willing to loan a remote
server from which we could launch our ZGrab2 queries.
(2) Signal our scan’s benign nature: In order to inform vigi-
lant network administrators why an unrecognized IP initi-
ated a handshake with a server in their network, we hosted
a simple webpage stating our general research intentions.
Additionally, we clarify that we are probing IP addresses
semi-randomly to prevent confusion and assure readers that
their network is not being specifically targeted.
(3) Provide an easy opt out: We include an email address on
the hosted webpage where network admins could opt out of
future scans or ask questions about our research.
(4) Distribute scans over time and IP space: The automator
read in the lists from Censys in no particular order, sparing
IP blocks from being queried all at once or small subnets
from being overloaded. Our scan’s highest throughput was
capped at 800,000 scans a day due to the varying amounts of
time it could take a worker to finish iterating through its list
of IP addresses. Subsequent days often produced fewer IP
scans as a result of workers finishing and not reading new IP
lists that were reserved by other workers. While this limited
the amount of traffic we could observe in five months, it
prevented both exorbitant egress from our hosting server
and the possibility of flooding local networks.
A.2 Reverse DNS Lookups
Our primary focus is on the number of unique IP addresses accept-
ing DES ciphers, but it is usually the case that IP address blocks are
allocated for specific organizations or regions. Aggregating support
for DES ciphers across these organizations can thus potentially
provide further insights.
We focus only on IP addresses that accepted a DES cipher to
minimize the number of queries made (and thus, reduce the bur-
den placed on the network). These hostnames3 were saved with
their corresponding IP address and joined to our handshake re-
sult data for analysis. In addition to aggregating numbers, we also
take a closer look at domains that own the largest numbers of IP
addresses accepting DES. This involves manually investigating host-
names and visiting domain webpages, and is thus time-intensive.
As such, we detail some interesting findings in Table 1, including
hostname, the number of IP addresses accepting DES ciphers, and
a general overview of the ciphers each domain accepts. It is un-
clear whether hn.kd.ny.adsl is a real domain given that the .adsl
TLD cannot be publicly resolved, and in other cases, DES support
could be a function of customer configuration as opposed to hosting
services. Nonetheless, it is interesting that many of these services
include colocation and communication providers (e.g., gradwell.com,
xenosite.net, cologlobal.com). Given that webservers within these
domains are supporting very weak DES ciphersuites, it would be-
hoove these organizations to ensure that they or their customers
discontinue their support.
A.3 Attacks Against TLS
TLS Attacks. BEAST [16] allows data decryption from MitM at-
tackers due to the use of CBC mode and predictable IVs in ear-
lier SSL/TLS versions. CRIME allows HTTPS session hijacking via
exploiting vulnerabilities in secret cookies that use data compres-
sion [25]. Lucky 13 [4] is a cryptographic timing attack against
TLS/DTLS connections that use CBC mode to recover plain texts.
Unfortunately, RC4, as a temporary workaround for Lucky 13, is
also vulnerable to statistical analysis due to its internal bias [3].
Heartbleed [35] leaks sensitive information from process memory
due to an OpenSSL implementation bug. POODLE [29] exploits TLS
clients’ vulnerability to downgrade to SSL3 and attacks against the
CBC mode. FREAK [7] and Logjam [2] downgrade TLS connections
to use export-grade cipher suites, which provide weak bit security
guarantees. SLOTH [9] demonstrates that the authentication in
TLS 1.2 could be broken due to the use of RSA-MD5 signatures.
DROWN [6] is a cross-protocol attack against TLS using the obso-
lete SSLv2 support, breaking the confidentiality of TLS connections.
Sweet32 [8] might be the only attack targeting DES/3DES cipher
suites with 64-bit block size by launching a birthday-bound attack
on CBC mode. While different TLS scans have covered studies of
different TLS attacks specifically, our work is DES focused and
meaningful, especially considering 3DES’s deprecation last year.
3Over 3.9 million servers used some form of reverse DNS protection (“no-reverse-dns-
set”), returned results that give little to no information about the hostname (“no-data”),
or responded with an error. We omit these results from the analysis in this section.
