### Deprecation and Analysis of DES-based Ciphersuites in the TLS Ecosystem

We have officially deprecated our use of DES-based ciphersuites by developing our own active scanning tool. Our analysis within the TLS ecosystem revealed that nearly half of the examined systems can still successfully establish an HTTPS connection using at least one DES cipher. Additionally, we observed the use of DES40 and anonymous ciphers, which are easily breakable and can facilitate man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Further analysis of hostnames and geographic information indicated that the use of DES-based ciphersuites remains prevalent among many ISP-like organizations and the global TLS ecosystem.

Note: An accepted cipher may be counted twice, such as EXPORT-DES40, which is counted as both an EXPORT cipher and a DES40 cipher. Each domain also supported one DES56 cipher.

### Appendix

#### A.1 Procedure for Scanning Across Hosts

To minimize the burden on the network and ensure ethical scanning, we followed these steps:

1. **Coordinate with Local Network Administrators**: We obtained permission from another university to use a remote server for our ZGrab2 queries.
2. **Signal Scan's Benign Nature**: We hosted a webpage stating our research intentions and clarifying that the scans were semi-random to prevent confusion.
3. **Provide an Easy Opt-Out**: We included an email address on the webpage for administrators to opt out of future scans or ask questions.
4. **Distribute Scans Over Time and IP Space**: We read the IP lists from Censys in no particular order, limiting the highest throughput to 800,000 scans per day to avoid overloading networks.

#### A.2 Reverse DNS Lookups

Our primary focus was on the number of unique IP addresses accepting DES ciphers. We performed reverse DNS lookups to aggregate support for DES ciphers across specific organizations and regions. We focused only on IP addresses that accepted a DES cipher to minimize the number of queries. These hostnames were saved with their corresponding IP addresses and joined to our handshake result data for analysis. Table 1 provides a detailed breakdown of the domains and the number of IP addresses accepting DES ciphers.

#### A.3 Attacks Against TLS

- **BEAST**: Allows data decryption from MitM attackers due to the use of CBC mode and predictable IVs in earlier SSL/TLS versions.
- **CRIME**: Enables HTTPS session hijacking via vulnerabilities in secret cookies that use data compression.
- **Lucky 13**: A cryptographic timing attack against TLS/DTLS connections using CBC mode to recover plaintexts.
- **Heartbleed**: Leaks sensitive information from process memory due to an OpenSSL implementation bug.
- **POODLE**: Exploits TLS clients' vulnerability to downgrade to SSL3 and attacks against the CBC mode.
- **FREAK and Logjam**: Downgrade TLS connections to use export-grade cipher suites, providing weak bit security guarantees.
- **SLOTH**: Demonstrates that the authentication in TLS 1.2 could be broken due to the use of RSA-MD5 signatures.
- **DROWN**: A cross-protocol attack against TLS using obsolete SSLv2 support, breaking the confidentiality of TLS connections.
- **Sweet32**: Targets DES/3DES ciphersuites with 64-bit block size by launching a birthday-bound attack on CBC mode.

While different TLS scans have covered various TLS attacks, our work specifically focuses on DES and is particularly meaningful given the recent deprecation of 3DES.
