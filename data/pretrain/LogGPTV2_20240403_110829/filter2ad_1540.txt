Intrusion  detection  is  a  technique  employed  to 
catch  and  report  attacks  as  they  occur.    It  is 
needed  given  that  vulnerabilities  in  operating 
systems,  network  protocols,  applications,  and 
configurations leave systems open to attacks.   
Intrusion detection systems rely on data sources, 
which can be drawn from operating system audit 
logs,  “sniffed”  network  packets, 
logs  from 
components such as routers or applications. The 
principal  approaches 
intrusion  detection 
include  misuse  detection  where  the  intrusion 
detection  system  detects  activity  that  matches 
attack signatures, and anomaly detection,  where 
the intrusion detection system identifies activity 
that  is  inconsistent  with  what  is  expected.    The 
expectation  can  be  derived  from  previously 
observed  activity  or  can  be  captured  in  a 
specification,  giving  rise  to  the  concept  of 
specification-based intrusion detection.    
Research  on  intrusion  detection  started  in  the 
early 1980s, has continued through several major 
DARPA  (and  other  Government)  programs  and 
has  led  to  a  number  of  products  and  numerous 
deployments.   Intrusion detection is particularly 
appealing  as  an  approach  to  enhancing  the 
security of existing systems where it is faster to 
configure  an  intrusion  detection  than  issue  and 
install  a  patch  when  a  new  vulnerability  is 
identified.   
  Furthermore,  anomaly-based  is 
perhaps  the  only  approach  to  the  detection  of 
unknown attacks.   
This  panel  discusses  the  evaluation  of  current 
intrusion  detection  systems  and  suggests  some

What current IDSs can do and cannot do 
Johannes Ulrich, Sans 
Modern  intrusion  detection  systems  are  able  to 
detect  attacks  early  and  in  some  cases  can  be 
used 
in  progress.  False 
positives  are  a  major  concern  delaying  further 
implementation  of  reactive  intrusion  detection 
systems. While modern IDSs have become better 
in  recognizing  and  defeating  popular  IDS 
evasion techniques, the fundamental problem of 
tuning  an  intrusion  detection  system  to  achieve 
optimum  performance  still  requires  a  skilled 
analyst  and  a  thorough  understanding  of  the 
protected  assets. 
to 
autonomously  ascertain  the  impact  of  a  packet 
stream to the network. However, some attempts 
to  combine  IDSs  with  vulnerability  scanners 
have  been  made  to  allow  the  IDS  to  become 
aware of the network.  
Something else an IDS is not able to do by itself 
is to look beyond the traffic stream it  monitors. 
Correlating  multiple  Sensors  and  integrating 
them  as  part  of  a  layered  network  defense 
requires the skilled use of other tools. 
Evaluation of Intrusion Detection Systems 
Joshua Haines, MIT Lincoln Laboratory 
IDS  performance  evaluation  is  central  to  IDS 
research and development.  Several recent efforts 
at  Lincoln  Laboratory  have  evaluated  intrusion 
detection system performance using a variety of 
techniques.    All  have  pointed  out  areas  where 
further  research  is  necessary  and  advanced  the 
field in many ways, however none has provided

example,  we  provided  testbed-generated  data 
that  could  be  authoritatively  labeled  and  has 
been  shared  amongst  researchers  to  start  many 
research  programs.    One  study  used  real-world 
data  with  selected  attacks  inter-mixed  so  that 
background data was very realistic, but the lack 
of  labeling  limited  false  alarm  measurement.

and stored centrally so that they represent a wide 
variety  of  network  and  system  configurations 
and  can  be  updated  periodically  without  undue 
effort  by  any  one  entity.    Datasets  will  need  to 
take  on  new  forms  such  as  specifications  and 
tools for created attack and background traffic in 
ones  own  environment  so  that  IDS  developers 
(and  their  systems)  can  explore  use  of  new  and 
different  inputs  for  their  systems.      Metrics  for 
IDS  performance  are  a  research  topic  in  and  of 
themselves,  and  will  need  to  be  expanded  to 
better  calculate  and  compare  the  amount  by 
which  an  IDS  improves  the  security  of  a  given 
network configuration rather than simply tallying 
attack and false alarm rates. 
Intrusion Report Correlation 
Phillip A. Porras, SRI International 
Among the most visible areas of active research 
in  the  IDS  community  is  the  development  of 
technologies  to  manage  and  interpret  security-
relevant  alert  streams  produced  from  an  ever-
increasing number of INFOSEC devices.   Over 
recent  years,  the  growing  number  of  security 
intrusion 
enforcement  services,  access

servers, 
vulnerability  scanners,  and  various  operating 
system  and  applications 
logs  have  given 
administrators  a  potential  wealth  of  information 
to  gain  insight  into  security-relevant  activities 
occurring within their systems.   The motivation 
for 
is 
straightforward:  as  we  continue  to  incorporate 
and distribute advanced security services into our 
networks,  we  need  the  ability  to  understand  the 
various forms of hostile and fault-related activity 
that our security services observe as they help to 
preserve  the  operational  requirements  of  our 
logs,

New techniques in detection and response 
Jeff Rowe, UC Davis 
Typically,  intrusion  detection  techniques  use 
signatures  of  known  malicious  behavior,  or 
classify  statistically  anomalous  behavior  as 
malicious.  The  signature  technique  is  limited 
when 
faced  with  new,  unknown  attacks. 
Statistical  anomaly-based  methods  can  handle 
new,  unknown  attacks  but  falsely  classify  new 
non-malicious  behavior  as  attacks  as  well.  New 
specification  based  approaches,  based  upon  the 
correct  security  behavior  of  a  system,  detect 
previously  unseen  attack 
instances  without 
misclassifying  non-malicious  new  behavior. 
With this approach, Formal methods might even 
be usefully applied to a real-time IDS, to verify 
that desirable security properties are enforced. 
The worm threat 
Stuart Staniford, Silicon Defense 
The nature of the worm threat will be discussed 
(as  distinct  from  viruses),  and  illustration  of 
various  worm-spread  strategies  with  examples 
from  worm  incidents  in  the  last  year  or  two.  
Scanning  worms  such  as  Code  Red  will  be 
addressed,  as  well  as  the  possibility  of  flash 
worms  (very  rapid  worms  with  entirely  pre-
scripted  spread  maps),  and  topological  worms, 
which rely on information on infected machines 
to find others. 
Then  work  on  detecting  and/or  stopping  worms 
will  be  the  focus.    First  GrIDS,  a  system

misbehavior by correlating connections that had 
something in common and occurred sufficiently 
close  together  in  time.    Such  connections  were 
assembled  into  graphs,  and  large  graphs  were 
indications  of  worms.    More  recently,  Silicon 
Defense  has  been  working  on  techniques  to 
prevent the spread of worms on networks.   
Approaches  for  stopping  scanning  and  flash 
worms  and  initial  ideas  on  topological  worms 
will  be  provided. 
  Finally,  wormholes  and 
honeyfarms  will  be  noted,  especially  ideas  for
