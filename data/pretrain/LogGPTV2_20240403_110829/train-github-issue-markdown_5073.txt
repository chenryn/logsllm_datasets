I raised this against VS Code, but they advise it's Electron's doing. When I
go to select a debug session and there are several, the dropdown menu grows
upwards but there's limited space on the screen so it ends up being quite
difficult to use.
  * Electron Version: 1.7.12
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): macOS High Seirra
  * Last known working Electron version: Unknown
**Expected Behavior**  
Drop-down lists near the edge of the screen should expand away from the edge
of the screen.
**Actual behavior**  
Drop-down renders upwards when at the top of the screen, making a tiny
scrollable menu.
**To Reproduce**  
Open VS Code; and start several debugging sessions, then open the drop-down
that lets you select between them.
