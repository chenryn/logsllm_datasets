The Executing Process Phase is a critical process phase during OCM as business  
and technology changes are being implemented. It is in this process phase that  
the change is implemented and OCM activities are in full motion. OCM eforts in  
Executing include all knowledge areas, as shown in Figure 1-1. During this process  
phase the OCM Practitioner and team work in close collaboration with the Project  
Manager and other team members to execute OCM eforts. 
1.1   Introduction 
The Executing Process Phase involves many important OCM activities that are  
necessary  to  support  the  solution  implementation.  It  is  important  to  clearly  
understand organizational characteristics and key project milestones in order to  
align project communications and obtain Stakeholder support, including afected  
employees. To lead employees through the change, training is developed and  
delivered. Leaders, managers, and supervisors demonstrate visible support and  
deliver communications that reinforce the change initiative. 
Executing | Page 3 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingIn addition to supporting the project implementation and aligning Stakeholders  
external to the project team, OCM activities also focus on building the project  
team itself as it peaks in its size and composition mix. The project team may have  
resources assigned with various focuses and skills, including Business Process  
Reengineering (BPR), OCM, system development, conversion, and training. OCM  
becomes a critical enabler to help foster positive team dynamics and create a  
collaborative and high-performing team. 
OCM Lifecycle Management 
OCM Lifecycle Management activities includes an update to the OCM Schedule 
and conducting another assessment of organizational change readiness. These 
are used to update the OCM Plan developed during the Planning Process Phase 
to account for any changes that have occurred for the organization and project. 
This provides a strong foundation during this process phase, when the change 
initiative and related OCM eforts afect larger groups of leaders, employees, 
and  Stakeholders.  This  large  scale  efort  makes  implementing  targeted  and 
efective OCM activities much more critical. 
Communication 
Communication activities expand to include larger audiences and provide more  
detailed content. The OCM Practitioner utilizes the Communication Management  
Plan to strategize, develop, and deliver the right content, from the right sender, at  
the right time, to the right audience, by the right delivery channel. 
Leadership Support 
Leadership Support activities continue to identify, assess, and support leaders 
in  impacted  areas.  As  the  project  moves  closer  to  implementation,  the  OCM 
Practitioner  focuses  eforts  on  supervisors,  managers,  and  executives,  as  all 
levels  of  leadership  need  to  be  enrolled  in  the  change  and  provide  support 
that is visible to employees. Leadership Support in this process phase serves to 
assess leaders, define necessary leadership actions, and execute the activities 
prescribed. 
Executing | Page 4 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingTeam Dynamics 
The Executing Process Phase is the time when the Project Team expands and 
develops. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the team is operating in a positive, 
collaborative environment. In this process phase, the OCM Practitioner performs 
Team  Dynamics  activities  to  support  team  development  and  team  building,  
as necessary. 
Stakeholder Enrollment 
In  this  process  phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  builds  on  the  Stakeholder 
Management  activities  prescribed  in  the  CA-PMF  to  support  the  enrollment 
efort. The OCM Practitioner assists in defining participation needs, identifying 
and  engaging  resources  to  serve  as  Stakeholder  Group  Representatives 
and  Super  Users,  and  coaching  supervisors  and  managers  on  resistance 
management. 
Training 
Training marks one of the last steps of implementing the change. The Training  
resources working with the OCM Practitioner works to develop and deliver end  
user  training.  This  includes  developing  a  Training  Plan,  developing  training  
curriculum and materials, and delivering training to end users. Training activities  
provide end users with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to work in the new  
environment. 
Once all OCM-related Executing Process Phase activities have been completed,  
the OCM Practitioner will complete the OCM Executing Process Phase Checklist.  
Figure 1-2 shows the goals, inputs, activities, and outputs of the six knowledge  
areas that are active during the Executing Process Phase.

The following recommended practices will help the OCM Practitioner conduct 
OCM activities during the Executing Process Phase. 
Garner Management and Supervisor Support  
Throughout Implementation 
Managers, supervisors, and team leads are critical in their ability to influence 
their direct employees to successfully adopt the changes being implemented. 
They help communicate awareness about the change and are first in line to 
mitigate employee resistance. It is important to recognize the unique needs of 
these Stakeholders and define activities directly tailored to these leaders. 
Provide Opportunities for People to Feel Heard 
Whenever  and  wherever  possible,  the  OCM  Practitioner  should  provide 
impacted Stakeholders the opportunity for face-to-face and two-way dialogue 
to ask questions and express concerns. Dialogue allows the OCM Practitioner to 
listen actively and respond non-defensively to demonstrated concerns. Ofen 
times, the simple opportunity to be heard, and to state one’s case, can build 
trust and reduce tension and resistance. This is also an opportunity to identify 
gaps in strategy or implementation that the team should resolve. 
Be Repetitive and Consistent with Communications 
To be heard and understood accurately, communication messages must be sent 
and re-emphasized through repetition and multiple avenues of communication. 
Because  Stakeholders  are  in  constant  communication  with  each  other,  it  is 
critical that messages are accurate and consistent. 
Recognize the Need for Celebrating Project Team Successes 
Implementations  with  long  delays  and  dificult  workloads  can  be  hard  on 
team  members  and  the  organization.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should  remain 
active  in  the  project  team  by  guiding  evaluations  and  corrections  based  on 
the team behavior guidelines. Also pursue quick wins and include celebrating 
these successes along the way. This will help to energize the OCM team and 
the  organization  in  the  change  efort.  As  the  efort  garners  success  use  the 
momentum to push forward and further the vision for change.

Executing | Page 7 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingRecognize that Resistance is a Natural Part of the  
Change Process 
The  OCM  Practitioner  must  understand  and  accept  that  any  change  may 
encounter  resistance.  OCM  eforts  can  help  minimize  resistance  and/or 
address resistance by prescribing activities geared towards obtaining support 
from all levels of the organization. All change initiatives need to include and 
appropriately plan for resistance mitigating activities. It is the responsibility of 
the Sponsor and the OCM team to identify and remove barriers to change. 
Set Specific Training Goals 
With the complexity of developing, delivering, and evaluating end-user training, 
it is easy for the OCM Practitioner to identify unattainable training goals with 
learning objectives that are either too vague or too complex. The focus should 
be on the needs of the learners, the culture of the organization, and the nature 
of the change in order to set realistic training goals.

2.1.1 Inputs 
In order to complete the Executing Process Phase OCM Lifecycle Management 
activities,  the  OCM  Practitioner  will  need  a  thorough  understanding  of  the 
following inputs: 
OCM Schedule: The OCM Schedule, updated in the Planning Process Phase, 
identifies  the  OCM  activities  to  be  conducted.  This  provides  insight  into 
managing the activities, resources, and schedules that occur for the project. 
Project Management Plan (PMP): The Project Management Plan, developed in 
the Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, provides information 
regarding the management of the project scope, resources, and work plan. The 
OCM Plan and OCM Schedule should align with the relevant project information 
contained in the PMP. 
Executing | Page 10 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingOCM Lifecycle ManagementSchedule Management Plan: The Schedule Management Plan, developed in the  
Planning Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, describes the criteria and  
the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule. The OCM  
Schedule will follow the criteria set forth in the Schedule Management Plan. 
Stakeholder  Register:  The  Stakeholder  Register,  developed  in  the  Initiating 
Process Phase as prescribed by the CA-PMF, identifies the organizations, groups, 
and individuals with a stake in the project.

California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingOCM Lifecycle Management2.1.3 Activities 
The OCM Practitioner must plan, coordinate, and execute OCM eforts in all six 
OCM knowledge areas. This efort requires careful organization and planning. 
As  such,  the  OCM  Lifecycle  Management  Knowledge  Area  has  four  activities  
in the Executing Process Phase: 
•   Determine and plan for OCM activities 
•   Assess organizational change readiness 
•   Update the OCM Plan 
•   Execute and monitor the efectiveness of OCM activities 
Determine and Plan for OCM Activities 
The Executing Process Phase focuses on supporting the implementation and 
acceptance of the technology solution. Similar to prior process phases, OCM 
activities  that  occur  within  the  current  process  phase  must  be  identified, 
resourced, and scheduled, if they are not already in the schedule. As these items 
are addressed, they are added to the OCM Schedule. To update the OCM Schedule 
with Executing Process Phase activities, the OCM Practitioner should complete 
the following: 
•   Review the entirety of this chapter to identify the various activities and 
outputs that must be developed within each knowledge area in the 
Executing Process Phase. 
•   Based on project and organizational characteristics, identify the tasks 
necessary to complete the identified activities and include any specific 
details as needed. Consider any constraints that will dictate the timing, 
frequency, and order the activities need to be completed. 
•   Estimate the duration and efort to complete each task. Consider the scope 
and complexity of the project to come up with appropriate numbers. 
•   Work with the Project Manager to identify available resources to complete 
the tasks. The availability of resources to support the efort may require 
re-work of the schedule. 
Skills 
Use the following skills to 
complete the activity: 
•   Project Management 
•   Analysis 
•   Collaboration 
Tools

Executing | Page 12 
California Department of TechnologyOrganizational Change Management FrameworkExecutingOCM Lifecycle ManagementThe OCM Practitioner should work with the Project Manager and leverage the 
project  organization  chart  and  Stakeholder  Register  to  identify  and  allocate 
these resources in the OCM Schedule. Once the schedule has been developed, 
the  OCM  Practitioner  will  work  with  the  Project  Manager  to  integrate  the 
tasks into the greater project schedule, following the guidance set forth in the 
Schedule Management Plan, to monitor and control. 
Assess Organizational Change Readiness 
In  the  Planning  Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  conducted  the 
Organizational Readiness Assessment with a sample size of participants from 
each organizational area. In the Executing Process Phase, the change initiative 
expands  to  include  the  entire  afected  population  and  the  OCM  Practitioner 
should conduct an additional assessment at this time to gauge whether any 
changes to organizational readiness have occurred since previous assessment 
was completed. At this time, the OCM Practitioner should seek to increase the 
number of participants and may even consider surveying the entire afected 
population  for  additional  input.  The  output  of  the  Organizational  Change 
Readiness  Assessment  should  be  evaluated  as  it  was  done  in  the  Planning 
Process Phase and results compared to identify any variations. Any change in 
organizational readiness should be considered when updating the OCM Plan. 
Update the OCM Plan 
The  OCM  Practitioner  initially  developed  the  OCM  Plan  during  the  Planning 
Process  Phase.  Since  a  significant  time  may  have  elapsed,  or  project  and 
organizational  characteristics  may  have  changed,  the  OCM  Plan  should  be 
reviewed and updated as necessary. Factors to consider for this update include: 
•   The results from the Organizational Change Readiness Assessment 
completed in the Executing Process Phase. 
•   Additional details identified regarding the solution or the implementation 
approach, e.g., the number and frequency of releases or integration of an
