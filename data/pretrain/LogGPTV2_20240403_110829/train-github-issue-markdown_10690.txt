### Problem description
Any material-ui button stays in a focused state even after click or tap event
has ended. It displays a white translucent overlay. It looks really bad! How
can I hide it? Is there a standard way to do that? Here's a little hack on how
to accomplish it.  
`this.refs.searchBtn.refs.overlay.style.background = 'none';`
