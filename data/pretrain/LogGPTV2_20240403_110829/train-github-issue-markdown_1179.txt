##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
include and include_tasks
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.4.3.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = [u'/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
      ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
      executable location = /bin/ansible
      python version = 2.7.5 (default, Aug  4 2017, 00:39:18) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16)]
##### CONFIGURATION
No change
##### SUMMARY
If I run a playbook importing many tasks with "include_tasks" (ansible-
loop_include_tasks.tar.gz), it hangs with the error:
    OSError: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory
However, if I run the same playbook with "include" (ansible-
loop_include.tar.gz) instead of "include_tasks", it finishes successfully.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Attached the following playbooks to replicate this:
  * Using "include_tasks":  
ansible-loop_include_tasks.tar.gz
  * Using "include":  
ansible-loop_include.tar.gz
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Both of playbooks finishes correctly.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
When I ran the playbook with "include_tasks" (ansible-
loop_include_tasks.tar.gz), I am getting the following error:
    TASK [loop : Hello Message] ******************************************************************************************************************************************************************
    task path: /home/vagrant/ansible-projects/ansible-loop/loop/tasks/hello-world-32.yml:2
    ERROR! Unexpected Exception, this is probably a bug: [Errno 12] Cannot allocate memory
