#### Issue Description
For the past couple of weeks I haven’t been able to access the site. While I
can access the offline cloud flare version of the homepage I receive the
message error “522 connection timed out” and “Host Error”; I haven’t been
having a problem on other sites. The site works on my phone when it’s
disconnected to the home wifi but for some reason the home wifi produces a
“host error”. Does anyone know how I could fix this?
This is my 2nd time submitting this problem.
