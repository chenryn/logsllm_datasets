Please allow setting custom analyzers that use the `keyword` tokenizer and
safe token filters on keyword fields. This would be great so we can use
`doc_values` for things like case-insensitive sorting and icu collation
without needing to create pipelines.
This was originally discussed in #12394 and the last comment from @jpountz
said this can be done in a future `5.x` release. This issue is to keep track
of this potential enhancement.
