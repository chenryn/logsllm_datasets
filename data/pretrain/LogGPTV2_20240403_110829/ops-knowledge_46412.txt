User: China blocks appspot -- How do I get around this?
Assuming the censorship was not an issue, how bad are the latency issues?
Assistant: Assuming Google has, and routes to, Datacenters in Asia, the latency should be reasonable.
The reverse proxy to avoid the firewall should be in a country that does not censor and is as near as possible to the target area.
In those conditions, google would choose a datacenter near your reverse proxy, and the latency is rtt(google<->proxy)+rtt(user<->proxy)
But you really have to try this out.
