##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
`docker_container`
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.1.2.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
None
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Linux/Fedora 22
##### SUMMARY
When running a task with an `entrypoint` parameter, a docker container is
destroyed and recreated each time after the first time it is run.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Fill in the variables and run this twice:
    - name: Create data container
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ docker_data_name }}"
        image: "{{ image }}"
        state: present
        entrypoint: "/bin/echo Data-only container for {{ name }}"
On the second run this roduces:
    TASK [docker-image : Create data container] ************************************
    changed: [hostname]
Destroy that container, comment out the entrypoint, then run this twice
    - name: Create data container
      docker_container:
        name: "{{ docker_data_name }}"
        image: "{{ image }}"
        state: present
        #entrypoint: "/bin/echo Data-only container for {{ name }}"
On the second run this poduces:
    TASK [docker-image : Create data container] ************************************
    ok: [hostname]
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Ansible reports no change. The created timestamp should be the same as the
first time it was run.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Ansible reports a change, and the created timestamp becomes recent.
