emphasize their similarities and differences. We consider the
following characteristics of a hijack event:
•
•
•
•
•
(C.1) Whether spam emails were received from the IP
address range at our spamtraps and/or spam sources
were blacklisted for the IP address range in Spamhaus
SBL or DROP (Don’t Route Or Peer) [10], Ucepro-
tect [13] or Manitu [6].
(C.2) The duration of the unadvertised period of
the IP preﬁx, which corresponds to the amount of time
elapsed between the last time it was announced and
the moment it was hijacked.
(C.3) The registration date of the IP address range,
which is the date at which it was allocated or assigned
by a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to an Internet
Service Provider (ISP) or end-user (e.g., a company).
(C.4) The size of the IP address range, which deﬁnes
the number of individual IP addresses available in the
range.
(C.5) Whether the owner of the IP address block is
still in business.

mostly registered after 2000. It is noteworthy that at the time
they were hijacked, these ranges were all properly registered
IP address blocks assigned to an organisation. None of them
was part of “bogon” IP address blocks, i.e., IP addresses that
should not be announced on the Internet [11].
(C.4) In [35], Ramachandran et al. claimed to have ob-
served spam from large (i.e., /8) hijacked IP address blocks.
In our 35 long-lived hijack cases, the IP address blocks were
smaller than what was claimed in previous studies, i.e., the
largest was a /19 and the smallest was a /24.
(C.5) The analysis of whois records for long-lived hi-
jacked IP address blocks revealed that most of the 35 blocks
refer to organisations that are apparently out of business. This
observation indicates that attackers might speciﬁcally target
unannounced IP address space whose registrant does not exist
anymore, for instance when a company is dissolved, acquired
by or merged into another one. In some cases, its IP address
blocks may be left unused.
Last but not
least, we managed to get feedback from
an ISP unwittingly involved in 23 out of the 35 long-lived
hijacks. After investigation on their side, the ISP conﬁrmed
these attacks had taken place and were performed by one
of their customers, without
initially. The
elements we provided corroborated their observations, and
the ISP has since then terminated his peering contract with
the misbehaving AS owner.

2) Short-lived hijacks
In this Section we focus our analysis on the 2,620
short-lived hijacks (out of
the total 2,655 hijacks). We
further distinguish two episodes in these short-lived hijacks:
(1) spam and blacklisted spam sources related to hijacked
networks observed between February and May 2013 and (2)
an interesting hijack phenomenon observed between June
2013 and June 2014, showing a striking and unusual temporal
pattern in the BGP announcements. We ﬁrst present these two
episodes and their differences with respect to characteristic
C.1. Afterwards, we describe their commonalities in terms of
the other characteristics C.2-5.
