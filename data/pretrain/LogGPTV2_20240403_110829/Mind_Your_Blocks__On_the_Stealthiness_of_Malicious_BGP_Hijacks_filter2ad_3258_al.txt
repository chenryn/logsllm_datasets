To better understand and compare the characteristics of hijack events, we will examine the following aspects:

1. **Spam Activity and Blacklisting (C.1)**: Whether spam emails were sent from the IP address range, and if the IP address range was blacklisted by Spamhaus SBL or DROP, Uceprotect, or Manitu.

2. **Unadvertised Period Duration (C.2)**: The duration of the unadvertised period for the IP prefix, which is the time elapsed between the last announcement and the moment it was hijacked.

3. **Registration Date (C.3)**: The date when the IP address range was allocated or assigned by a Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to an ISP or end-user.

4. **IP Address Range Size (C.4)**: The number of individual IP addresses available in the range.

5. **Business Status of the Owner (C.5)**: Whether the owner of the IP address block is still in business.

### Long-Lived Hijacks

**Spam Activity and Blacklisting (C.1)**:
- 35 long-lived hijacked IP address blocks were mostly registered after 2000.
- At the time of hijacking, these ranges were all properly registered and assigned to organizations.
- None of these IP address blocks were part of "bogon" IP address blocks, which are not supposed to be announced on the internet.

**IP Address Range Size (C.4)**:
- In previous studies, Ramachandran et al. observed spam from large (i.e., /8) hijacked IP address blocks.
- In our 35 long-lived hijack cases, the IP address blocks were smaller, with the largest being a /19 and the smallest a /24.

**Business Status of the Owner (C.5)**:
- Analysis of WHOIS records revealed that most of the 35 long-lived hijacked IP address blocks were associated with organizations that appeared to be out of business.
- This suggests that attackers may target unannounced IP address space where the registrant no longer exists, such as when a company is dissolved, acquired, or merged into another entity, leaving the IP address blocks unused.

**ISP Feedback**:
- We received feedback from an ISP involved in 23 out of the 35 long-lived hijacks.
- The ISP confirmed the attacks after their own investigation and noted that one of their customers was responsible.
- The ISP has since terminated their peering contract with the misbehaving AS owner.

### Short-Lived Hijacks

In this section, we analyze the 2,620 short-lived hijacks (out of the total 2,655 hijacks). We distinguish two episodes in these short-lived hijacks:

1. **Spam and Blacklisted Sources (February to May 2013)**:
   - During this period, spam and blacklisted spam sources were observed related to hijacked networks.
   - This episode is characterized by significant spam activity and blacklisting.

2. **Unusual Temporal Pattern (June 2013 to June 2014)**:
   - An interesting hijack phenomenon was observed, showing a striking and unusual temporal pattern in BGP announcements.
   - This episode differs from the first in terms of the temporal pattern but shares other characteristics.

**Commonalities (C.2-5)**:
- Both episodes share commonalities in the unadvertised period duration, registration date, IP address range size, and the business status of the owner.
- These commonalities provide a broader context for understanding the nature and impact of the hijack events.

By examining these characteristics, we can better understand the similarities and differences between long-lived and short-lived hijack events, and gain insights into the tactics and targets of such attacks.
