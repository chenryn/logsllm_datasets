I was not heroic or seeking martyrdom and it seemed to work. I testified at the World
Court which was very important to me – that was an important event and had an impact
on foreign policy. We evolved a growing community even then of former intelligence
officers, John Stockwell and others who put the association together, and I became the
Washington representative. We published our magazine Unclassified bimonthly for 5-6
years. It was a good magazine and attacked a lot of these issues and had a reasonable
circulation. Lots of media people used it. 
RT: Can you evaluate the impact of what you did? 
DM: In terms of impact, timing is important. We broadened the conversation on the use
of intelligence. The slogan I devised was: we are not opposed to intelligence but we are
opposed to covert paramilitary operations which by definition are violations of
international law. The timing was important because of the Iran-Contra hearings—but in
fact, in terms of impact, it was discouraging to see how Congress dealt with it. It was the
most significant constitutional scandal we had had and they pushed it under the rug. The
facts cried out for impeachment. The emotional quality of words is important when you
get involved at this level and “impeachment” is one of those words. The use of those
words climaxed or I should say anti-climaxed with eleventh hour pardons from George
Bush the First. It left a bad feeling, to say the least. 
What was the use? What did it matter, everything we did?
RT: It creates cynicism.
DM: Oh, did it ever.
It’s an old story. In the Book of Samuel, the people said they wanted a King. Samuel
said, I’ll tell you what will happen if you have a King: he’ll take your young men and
send them to war, take your money to build himself houses, take your women for his own
projects, and he’ll put incredible taxes on you. 
And the people of Israel said, We want a King! and that was that. 
How much has changed?
RT: The conference on Intelligence and Ethics is an attempt to build a context for
examining these issues and what it does to intelligence professionals over a lifetime to
do, to know, to hear about what you describe. Do you think the project is viable?
DM: In the most brutal organizations – in the Gestapo, for example - a miniscule
proportion of the people in the organization participate in the worst barbarities. Most go
home, play with their kids, are nice to their neighbors, and can deal with it. The further
you are away from actually “doing it,” the less problems you have. Firing a Tomahawk
missile is not hand-to-hand combat. 
But we can talk about this in terms of war crimes. Attacks on civilian population centers
are prohibited but in WWI we were ready to do it and then, in WW2, none of the aerial
attacks in violation of those norms like incendiary bombings in Japan were ever brought
up. Is that the American way of war or simply the industrial way of war? I don’t know. 
My background gave me some credibility when I spoke out and I hope it had some
impact on members of Congress. Did that effect policy? I can’t say. My greatest
disappointment was in 1988 when I was asked by the Dukakis campaign and the
Democratic National Committee to make presentations on how to use this issue and I was
so disappointed by their response. I had been speaking all around the country and said, if
you take on this issue in 1988 and say, if I’m elected, the Contra program is over, there
are groups all over the country that will respond, but my God, the waffling! Oh well, they
said, well, yes, but you know, and all that. The inability of people to grasp these
particular nettles is one reason their campaigns deflate. Talk about impact, you can
generate ten thousand letters to the editor but it does not have political impact. In those
dreadful hearings, the expose went on and on—but for what?  
RT: Well? Was it worth it?
DM: You find yourself in this situation maybe once in a  lifetime. You only come to the
plate once and had better take your swings. I took my swings. That was my one ethical
plus in a lifetime of unethical behavior. 
RT: You distinguish covert operations from gathering intelligence. Doesn’t that go back
to how the law creating the CIA was interpreted?
DM: The specific law establishing the CIA, the National Security Act of 1947, directed
the CIA to carry out “other activities of an intelligence nature as the National Security
Council may from time to time direct.” What the hell did that mean? The first General
Counsel of the CIA, asked if it meant the behind-the-lines kinds of operations the OSS
had carried out, said, “Absolutely not.” But Frank Wisner and others grabbed onto the
language;, Wisner with his “mighty Wurlitzer” cranking out propaganda, went
adventuring. Yet you know – most of those early escapades were total disasters. 
RT: So much was ill-conceived—
DM: Yes, but oh, the glamour of doing it—
RT: The Oliver North syndrome. 
DM: The attraction of playing cowboys and Indians is so great. So you have to question
whether we can even discuss ethics and intelligence in the same breath. The New York
Times wrote an article about our conference and quoted Dewey Claridge. “Ethics? Are
you crazy? You go into this line of business, you’re expected to do this.” 
I recall when the General Counsel for the CIA let down her guard in an interview with
AP and said, yes, we lie cheat steal and occasionally kill but overall, the people in the
CIA are as fine a bunch as you’ll ever find anywhere!
RT: I am told that EO 12333 (Executive Order 12333 prohibits assassinations and other
specific activities) is being rewritten. “Stand by,” were the final words of General
Hayden as to whether current NSA activities were covered. But my sense is that it was
always being rewritten.
DM: Of course it was. I think of  the law professor at the University of Virginia who was
heading a panel of the law association on ethics and intelligence in the early nineties and
said, on the matter of assassination, well, that term is not really correctly used, it should
not be directed at every intent to kill someone.
RT: What drove all this, David? What compelled intelligent people to get so wild? 
DM: Like so much in the intelligence system, it looked sexy to some people and above
all, THE MONEY WAS THERE. That drives all of this. People will do what they can
fund. The lines between organizations and proprietaries and contractors and agencies are
very blurred and the money is more like a transmission belt than a revolving door. When
I did contract work, I did some projects I was not all that proud of, some of the work was
questionable—like various interrogation technologies that have been worked on for thirty
years, measuring changes in the size of the pupil of the eye to see if someone’s lying —I
tend to be dismissive of those efforts but when you’re looking for “capabilities and
intentions,”  there is a whole lot of road to look at and not a lot of rubber. The faintest
skid marks are supposed to tell you significant things but interpreting the marks is not
easy. Intelligence is divided into two parts: one is Tactical Intelligence and Related
Activity (TIARA). TIARA is usually pretty good and you have the ability to know
through surveillance or interceptions where various enemy units are, that’s what I used
and looked at in the Marine Corps. That’s hard enough in the well-known fog of war. But
when you take it to this other level where you’re fumbling with intentions, industrial
capabilities, etc. – it’s useful for discussion but is it really useful for immediate action
and decision making? It’s questionable. The intelligence is several steps removed the
real. So how useful is it? You have to understand that once the analytic side, not the
operational side, is wedded to using these techniques, you’re like a tenured professor
working in your area of specialty, you get enormous satisfaction from doing so, and you
get funded. But how useful is it? 
The only time I ever heard ethical issues raised in relationship to our work came when
someone stood back and looked at what they were doing and said: what am I doing? what
am I really doing?
RT: Is there realistic accountability to the citizens of the country and the Constitution? Is
meaningful transparency possible? 
DM: I know someone who sued the CIA because he said they did not meet the terms of
their contract with him. He operated a proprietary or front organization for them and
shipped various things around the world. When he told them he wanted to stop, they said
he couldn’t. He sued the agency under a law that applied to law enforcement and the
agency actually informed the court that the individual he named in his suit was a CIA
officer and therefore the case should be dismissed since they were not law enforcement. 
You’ll hear it said that intelligence professionals can not operate outside the law. But
Lawrence Welch said, there IS a class of people who can not be held accountable under
the law. 
The issue of transparency raises another issue: when is it ethical to speak out? They use
“national security” to cover everything now. The state secrecy issue is completely out of
hand. If you accept that the citizen has a right to know information that directly impacts
him, does the person who has that knowledge have the requirement to inform him?  The
same applies to classification and compartmentalization.
Remember how all intelligence systems operate. The operations officer in the CIA station
has one primary responsibility: to recruit agents. Agents, by definition, are citizens of the
government of the country in which the station chief operates. An agent is someone who
provides information or services FOR A CONSIDERATION – this is important, we
don’t let people “volunteer” to work for us – and therefore is a traitor to his own country.
We are in the business of soliciting people to betray their loyalties. That’s the nature of
the business. 
So how can we discuss these critical ethical issues in that context?. Those early fiascoes
came to a head with the Korean effort. We had an elaborate network out of Seoul
reporting exact and precise information about North Korea but when it was reviewed, we
learned that 90% of the agents running out of Seoul were doubled by the North Koreans.
An enormous fiasco. Beetle Smith, CIA director at the time, said, we’re not going to
write a report on this because if it ever gets out, it would be the end of the CIA. 
The question is: given that the mission of the CIA station is to recruit agents, why would
a country knowingly allow a CIA station to be established? As we said, the record of the
agency in the first years was a fiasco—forget about the Italian election, that was just a
good Bronx-style election that we bought. 
RT: After the Italian election and the demise of Arbenz in Guatemala, they said, this is
easy. It went to their heads. 
DM: The penetration in hard targets, the Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and after 1949,
China – that did not happen. In the fifties and sixties, at the height of the post-colonial
period, the CIA turned its attention to Latin America and that’s where they had success
because those targets are so soft, the societies are so corrupt, and the guys in the security
agencies lined up – believe me – and said, sign me up! It’s a good payday. That’s where
so many careers were made. I saw many of these operations going on in Africa, Latin
America, and in Bangkok where I worked – this in itself is an “ethical issue.” You are
persuading people to do this. 
RT: In and of itself, you are saying, the nature of the work breaks ethical norms as we
understand them in other contexts. It’s about control by nearly any means. 
DM: Yes. My late colleague, Diane Kuntz, served in the station in Lima Peru. A junior
officer at the Chinese embassy requested a particular prostitute. So they got the cameras
in there and filmed, that was always fun, but what ticked Diane off is that all the other
officers at the station watched the films on a weekly basis but they wouldn‘t let her
watch. 
After they had enough stuff on the guy, they arranged for an agency officer to storm in
and see this guy, shrieking that this woman is his daughter and bad things will happen
and they have these films and then they make the pitch. This guy did what any sensible
person would do. He went to his superiors and told them what happened, this is what they
asked, and he was on the next plane back to Beijing and went on with his career. 
The point is, they’re always looking for things like that to trap people, and you rationalize
it, you justify it, you say, this is my job and we’re obtaining information that we need,
and if your skin isn’t thick enough to do it—then get a different job.
