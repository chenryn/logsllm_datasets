User: Is there a way to change the name of a process running a python script on Linux?
When I do a ps, all I get are "python" process names.
Assistant: the procname library didn't work for me on ubuntu. I went with setproctitle instead (pip install setproctitle). This is what gunicorn uses and it worked for me.
