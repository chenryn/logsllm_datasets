specific communication channels in specific slots. In contrast to
the previous studies [40, 45] that only analyzes the ideal case and
assumes Slenдth to be equal to Nchannel , this paper represents
the first systematic study that investigates the security vulnera-
bility of TSCH channel hopping in IEEE 802.15.4e under realistic
traffic. More important, this paper details a step-by-step attacking
approach and presents two case studies with real-world TSCH im-
plementations running on a physical testbed. The experimental
results show that an attacker can reverse engineer the channel hop-
ping sequences by silently observing the channel activities, making
selective jamming attack a realistic threat to the TSCH networks.
The current industrial WSAN standards (e.g., WirelessHART
and ISA100) equip many security features to protect the network
against such attacks as denial of service (DoS), MAC spoofing,
man in the middle (MITM), and authentication and encryption
cracking. There has been an increasing interest in investigating
security issues in those standards. For instance, Raza et al. analyzed
the potential attacks to WSANs and proposed a series of security
enhancement mechanisms for WirelessHart [35]. Alcazar et al. pre-
sented a series of vulnerabilities on the routing of WirelessHart
and ISA100 and proposed some countermeasures [2]. Pietro et
al. developed a distributed self-healing protocol to enhance the
intrusion-resilience [27]. Chakrabarty et al. proposed a software
defined networking (SDN) architecture to mitigate traffic analysis
and data gathering attacks [4]. IEEE 802.15.4 also provides security
features such as data confidentiality, data authenticity, and replay
protection of MAC frames. For example, the standard includes a se-
curity suite based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128
bits symmetric-key cryptography and supports three different secu-
rity modes: encryption only (CTR), authentication only (CBC MAC),
and both encryption and authentication (CCM). Unfortunately, the
above security features cannot prevent an attacker from cracking
the channel hopping sequences by silently observing the channel
activities. Our work is therefore orthogonal and complementary.
8 CONCLUSIONS
Industrial IoT, underlying the Fourth Industrial Revolution (or Indus-
try 4.0), promises to be one of the largest potential economic effects
of IoT. IEEE 802.15.4-based WSANs technology is appealing for
use in industrial IoT applications because it does not require wired
infrastructure and can be manufactured inexpensively. Battery-
powered wireless modules easily and inexpensively retrofit existing
sensors and actuators in industrial facilities without running cables
for communication and power. To address the stringent real-time
and reliability requirements posed by industrial IoT applications,
WSANs made a set of unique design choices such as employing
TSCH that distinguish themselves from traditional WSNs that re-
quire only best effort services. The function-based channel hopping
in TSCH simplifies the network operations at the cost of security.
Our study shows that an attacker can reverse engineer the channel
hopping sequences by silently observing the channel activities and
put the network in danger of selective jamming attacks, bringing se-
vere threats into WSANs. This paper represents the first systematic
study that investigates the security vulnerability of TSCH channel
hopping in IEEE 802.15.4e under realistic traffic, demonstrates the
cracking process, and presents two case studies using publicly ac-
cessible TSCH implementations. Finally, this paper provides a set
of insights gathered from our analysis and case studies to secure
the TSCH channel hopping by increasing the cracking difficulty.
For future work, we plan to study how an attacker identifies the
key messages delivering in the network and launches the selective
jamming attacks. Once we fully understand the problem from an
attacker’s point of view, then we can develop strategies to efficiently
detect the selective jamming attacks and defense solutions in future.
