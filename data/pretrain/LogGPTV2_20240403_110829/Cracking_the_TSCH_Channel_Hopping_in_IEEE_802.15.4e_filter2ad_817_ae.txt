### Specific Communication Channels in Specific Slots

In contrast to previous studies [40, 45], which only analyze the ideal case and assume that the slot length is equal to the number of channels, this paper presents the first systematic study investigating the security vulnerabilities of TSCH (Time-Slotted Channel Hopping) in IEEE 802.15.4e under realistic traffic conditions. More importantly, this paper details a step-by-step attack approach and presents two case studies using real-world TSCH implementations on a physical testbed. The experimental results show that an attacker can reverse-engineer the channel hopping sequences by silently observing channel activities, making selective jamming attacks a realistic threat to TSCH networks.

### Security Features in Industrial WSAN Standards

Current industrial Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) standards, such as WirelessHART and ISA100, incorporate numerous security features to protect against denial-of-service (DoS), MAC spoofing, man-in-the-middle (MITM), and authentication and encryption cracking attacks. There has been increasing interest in investigating security issues in these standards. For instance, Raza et al. analyzed potential attacks on WSANs and proposed several security enhancement mechanisms for WirelessHART [35]. Alcazar et al. identified vulnerabilities in the routing of WirelessHART and ISA100 and suggested countermeasures [2]. Pietro et al. developed a distributed self-healing protocol to enhance intrusion resilience [27]. Chakrabarty et al. proposed a software-defined networking (SDN) architecture to mitigate traffic analysis and data gathering attacks [4].

IEEE 802.15.4 also provides security features such as data confidentiality, data authenticity, and replay protection for MAC frames. The standard includes a security suite based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 128-bit symmetric-key cryptography and supports three different security modes: encryption only (CTR), authentication only (CBC-MAC), and both encryption and authentication (CCM). Unfortunately, these security features do not prevent an attacker from cracking the channel hopping sequences by silently observing channel activities. Our work is therefore orthogonal and complementary to existing security measures.

### Conclusions

Industrial IoT, a key component of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), promises significant economic benefits. IEEE 802.15.4-based WSANs are appealing for industrial IoT applications due to their low cost and lack of wired infrastructure. Battery-powered wireless modules can easily and inexpensively retrofit existing sensors and actuators in industrial facilities without requiring cables for communication and power. To meet the stringent real-time and reliability requirements of industrial IoT applications, WSANs employ unique design choices, such as TSCH, which distinguish them from traditional WSNs that provide only best-effort services. However, the function-based channel hopping in TSCH simplifies network operations at the cost of security.

Our study shows that an attacker can reverse-engineer the channel hopping sequences by silently observing channel activities, posing a severe threat to WSANs through selective jamming attacks. This paper represents the first systematic study to investigate the security vulnerability of TSCH channel hopping in IEEE 802.15.4e under realistic traffic conditions, demonstrating the cracking process and presenting two case studies using publicly accessible TSCH implementations. Finally, this paper provides insights gathered from our analysis and case studies to secure TSCH channel hopping by increasing the difficulty of cracking.

### Future Work

For future work, we plan to study how an attacker identifies key messages in the network and launches selective jamming attacks. Once we fully understand the problem from an attacker's perspective, we can develop strategies to efficiently detect and defend against selective jamming attacks.
