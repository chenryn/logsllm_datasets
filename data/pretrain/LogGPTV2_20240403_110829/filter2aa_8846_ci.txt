Alternatively, if you hold a four-year college degree or an approved credential or certification, you can qualify with four years of experience in at least two of the eight domains. For a complete list of approved credentials and certifications, visit [https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Prerequisite-Pathway](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Prerequisite-Pathway).

The exam is lengthy, especially compared to other industry certifications. You can take it in English or another language:
- **English Language Exam (CAT Format):** The exam is computerized adaptive testing (CAT), which adjusts based on your answers. You have up to 3 hours to complete between 100 and 150 questions.
- **Non-English Language Exams (Linear Format):** These exams are linear, and you have up to 6 hours to complete 250 questions.

To pass the exam, you must score at least 700 points.

### How to Use This Study Guide

Using a variety of study sources and methods enhances your chances of passing the CISSP exam. For example, instead of reading multiple books, you might read one book, watch a series of videos, take practice test questions, and read a study guide. Or, you might take a class, practice with test questions, and read a study guide. Joining a study group and reading a book can also be effective. Combining reading, listening, and hands-on practice helps your brain process and retain information. If your plan is to read this study guide and then immediately take the exam, you should reconsider your approach.

Here are a couple of ways to use this study guide effectively:
- **Initial Study:** Read it thoroughly to assess your knowledge. Determine if you already understand the material or if there are topics you need to focus on. This will help you identify which exam domains require additional study.
- **Final Review:** Use it as the last resource before taking the exam. If you have taken a class, read a book, and completed numerous practice questions, this study guide can help you confirm your readiness. Ensure that all the content in the guide is familiar and makes sense to you.

Note that a study guide like this does not provide in-depth coverage of new topics. However, it is a valuable preparation tool for reviewing a lot of material quickly. We have included the most important points for each topic, but it cannot replace the detailed background and context found in comprehensive textbooks.

### Recent Changes to the Exam

On April 15, 2018, the International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISCÂ²) released an updated set of exam objectives (the exam blueprint). This blueprint is available at [https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Exam-Outlines/CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx](https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Exam-Outlines/CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx).

While most exam topics remain the same, there are minor changes to reflect the latest industry trends and information. Most books for the new version of the exam were released in May 2018 or later. This study guide has been updated to reflect the new blueprint, with minor changes: a few small topics have been removed, some new ones added, and some items reworded.

If you are preparing for the exam, consider the following:
- **If you have already studied extensively:** Supplement your knowledge with sources that cover the new and revised material.
- **If you are just starting to study:** Consider waiting until the updated guides are available.

### Domain 1: Security and Risk Management

#### 1.1 Understand and Apply Concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

Confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) form the core of a security model that helps organizations maintain a secure environment.

- **Confidentiality:** Sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII) such as identification numbers and bank account numbers, must be kept confidential. Confidentiality differs from secrecy. Simply keeping something secret does not ensure confidentiality. To ensure confidentiality, use access controls (e.g., locked doors, folder permissions, two-factor authentication), encryption for data at rest, hashing for data in motion, and physical security for data in use (e.g., privacy screens, physical separation). Implement a "default deny" configuration to restrict access to only authorized individuals.

- **Integrity:** Ensure that data is not improperly changed. Encryption helps protect data at rest, while hashing is typically used for data in motion. Hashing assigns a numeric value to data, calculated at the source and verified by the recipient to ensure data integrity. Commonly used algorithms include SHA256 and SHA512, while older algorithms like SHA-1 are no longer secure.

- **Availability:** Ensure high availability of services and data using techniques such as failover clustering, site resiliency, automatic failover, load balancing, redundancy of hardware and software components, and fault tolerance. These measures can help mitigate denial of service (DoS) attacks, which aim to overload a system with invalid requests or requests that take a long time to process.

#### 1.2 Evaluate and Apply Security Governance Principles

To establish security governance principles, adopt a framework such as the one from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Ensure the framework includes the following:

- **Alignment of Security Function to Strategy, Goals, Mission, and Objectives:** An organization's mission and strategic goals flow down to tactical and operational plans. A security framework must align with the organization's mission and objectives, enabling the business to achieve its goals while securing the environment based on risk tolerance. For example, a car manufacturer's mission to build and sell high-quality cars might involve expanding automation, and the security framework must support this expansion.

- **Organizational Processes (Acquisitions, Divestitures, Governance Committees):** Be aware of the risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures. Governance committees (e.g., vendor, project, and architecture governance) provide oversight and approvals for new strategies or directions, ensuring a fresh perspective.

- **Organizational Roles and Responsibilities:** Management is responsible for keeping the business running and maximizing profits. Security architects and engineers must understand the organization's business needs, IT environment, and current security state, and develop strategies to maximize security and minimize risk. Translators between technical and non-technical stakeholders are essential, and costs must be justified and reasonable.

- **Security Control Frameworks:** Choose a control framework to ensure comprehensive security. Common frameworks include COBIT and the ISO 27000 series. These frameworks fall into four categories:
  - **Preventative:** Preventing security issues through policies and security awareness training.
  - **Deterrent:** Discouraging malicious activities using access controls and technologies like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
  - **Detective:** Uncovering unauthorized activity.
  - **Corrective:** Restoring the environment after a security incident.

- **Due Care and Due Diligence:** Understand the difference between these concepts. Due care involves legal responsibility to implement controls and follow policies, while due diligence involves understanding security governance principles and risks, gathering information, creating documentation, and disseminating it within the organization.

After establishing and documenting a governance framework, conduct security awareness training for all new hires and recertify existing employees regularly (typically yearly).

#### 1.3 Determine Compliance Requirements

Many organizations must comply with applicable laws and industry standards. Noncompliance can result in fines, jail time for executives, or even the end of a business. Focus on controls to achieve compliance. While many standards are vague about implementation, some, like NIST, provide detailed guidance.

- **Contractual, Legal, Industry Standards, and Regulatory Requirements:** Understand the legal systems, including civil law, common law, religious law, and customary law. Familiarize yourself with laws, regulations, and industry standards such as SOX, GLBA, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and FISMA.

- **Privacy Requirements:** Privacy involves the protection of PII. Laws vary, with the European Union having stringent privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Be familiar with requirements for healthcare data, credit card data, and other PII across different countries.

#### 1.4 Understand Legal and Regulatory Issues in a Global Context

While you may be familiar with local legal and regulatory issues, you must also understand them in a global context.

- **Cyber Crimes and Data Breaches:** Before expanding to other countries, perform due diligence to understand their legal systems and data handling requirements. Be familiar with the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and various data breach notification laws, such as HITECH, GLBA, and GDPR, which require reporting within 72 hours.

- **Licensing and Intellectual Property Requirements:** Understand the rules around licensing and intellectual property, including international agreements and local laws.
