Introduction
Exam Overview
Preparing to take the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) exam requires a great deal of time and
effort. The exam covers eight domains:
1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security
To qualify to take the exam, you must generally have at least five years of cumulative, paid, full-time work experience in two
or more of the eight domains. However, you can satisfy the eligibility requirement with four years of experience in at least
two of the eight domains if you have either a four-year college degree or an approved credential or certification. See
https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP/Prerequisite-Pathway for a complete list of approved credentials and
certifications.
The exam is long, especially compared with other industry certifications. You can take it in English or another language:
 The English language exam is a computerized adaptive testing (CAT) exam, so it changes based on your answers.
You get up to 3 hours to complete a minimum of 100 questions and a maximum of 150 questions.
 Exams in languages other than English remain in a linear format. You get up to 6 hours to complete a series of 250
questions.
You must score 700 points or more to pass the exam.

How to Use this Study Guide
Using multiple study sources and methods improves your chances of passing the CISSP exam. For example, instead of
reading three or four books, you might read one book, watch a series of videos, take some practice test questions and read
a study guide. Or you might take a class, take practice test questions and read a study guide. Or you might join a study
group and read a book. The combination of reading, hearing and doing helps your brain process and retain information. If
your plan is to read this study guide and then drive over to the exam center, you should immediately rethink your plan!
There are a couple of ways you can use this study guide:
 Use it before you do any other studying — Read it thoroughly. Assess your knowledge as you read. Do you already
know everything being said? Or are you finding that you can’t follow some of the topics easily? Based on how your
reading of the study guide goes, you’ll know which exam domains to focus on and how much additional study time
you need.
 Use it as the last thing you read prior to taking the exam — Maybe you’ve taken a class, read a book and gone
through a thousand practice test questions, and now you’re wondering if you are ready. This study guide might
help you answer that question. At a minimum, everything in this study guide should be known to you, make sense
to you and not confuse you.
Note that a study guide like this doesn’t dive deep enough to teach you a complete topic if you are new to that topic. But it
is a very useful preparation tool because it enables you to review a lot of material in a short amount of time. In this guide,
we’ve tried to provide the most important points for each of the topics, but it cannot include the background and details
you might find in a 1,000-page book.
Recent Changes to the Exam
On April 15, 2018, the agency that provides the CISSP exam, the International Info System Security Certification
Consortium, released an updated set of exam objectives (the exam blueprint). This blueprint is available at
https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Exam-Outlines/CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx.
While most of the exam topics remain the same, there are some minor changes to reflect the latest industry trends and
information. Most books for the new version of the exam will be released in May 2018 or later. This study guide has been
updated to reflect the new blueprint. The updates are minor: A few small topics have been removed, a few new ones
have been added, and some items have been reworded.
What does this mean for you if you are preparing to take the exam? If you have already spent a good amount of time
preparing, you might just need to supplement your study with some sources that explain the new and revised material.
But if you are just starting to study, consider waiting until the updated guides are released.

Domain 1. Security and Risk Management
1.1 Understand and apply concepts of confidentiality, integrity and
availability
Confidentiality, integrity and availability make up what’s known as the CIA triad. The CIA triad is a security model that helps
organizations stay focused on the important aspects of maintaining a secure environment.
 Confidentiality. Sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII) like identification numbers and
bank account numbers, must be kept confidential. It’s important to understand that confidentiality is different from
secrecy. If you aren’t aware something exists (such as data or a web service), then it is a secret. But keeping
something secret, by itself, doesn’t ensure confidentiality. You’ve probably seen stories of attackers (or even regular
web surfers) stumbling across “secret” web sites or information, sometimes by accident. To ensure confidentiality,
you must make certain that even if someone is aware that something valuable exists (such as a store that processes
credit card transactions or a file share with sensitive data), they can’t get to it. At a high level, you use access controls
— locked doors, folder permissions and two-factor authentication — to maintain confidentiality. At a lower level,
you use encryption to protect data at rest, hashing to protect data in motion, and physical security for data in use
(privacy screens or physical separation between data in use and unauthorized persons). You can use a “default
deny” configuration so that unless somebody has been expressly authorized to access data, they are denied access.
 Integrity. You also have to make certain that data isn’t changed improperly. Encryption helps ensure the integrity
of data at rest, but it isn’t the best option for data in motion. Instead, hashing is typically used. Hashing data assigns
the data a numeric value, which is calculated at the source before the transfer and then again by the recipient after
the transfer; a match proves data integrity. Algorithms such as SHA256 and SHA512 are commonly used for
hashing; older algorithms, such as SHA-1, have become susceptible to attack and therefore are rarely used.
 Availability. To ensure high availability of services and data, use techniques like failover clustering, site resiliency,
automatic failover, load balancing, redundancy of hardware and software components, and fault tolerance. For
example, they can help you thwart a denial of service (DoS) attack that aims to deny the availability of a service or
data by overloading a system with invalid requests or requests that take a long time to process.
1.2 Evaluate and apply security governance principles
To establish security governance principles, adopt a framework such as the one from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST). Be sure the framework you choose includes the following:
 Alignment of security function to strategy, goals, mission, and objectives. An organization has a mission and
uses strategy, plans and objectives to try to meet that mission. These components flow down, with the ones below
supporting the ones above. Business strategy is often focused 5 or more years out. In the shorter term, typically 1
to 2 years, you have tactical plans that are aligned with the strategic plan. Below that are operational plans — the
detailed tactical plans that keep the business running day to day. Objectives are the closest to the ground and
represent small efforts to help you achieve a mission. For example, a car manufacturer’s mission might be to build
and sell as many high-quality cars as possible. The objectives might include expanding automation to reduce the
9
total build time of a car and expanding from 2 factories to 3. A security framework must closely tie to the
organization’s mission and objectives, enabling the business to complete its objectives and advance the mission
while securing the environment based on risk tolerance. Continuing with the car manufacturer example, the
security framework must enable the expansion of automation. If the security framework is such that automation
cannot be expanded, then the security framework isn’t sufficiently aligned with the mission and objectives.
 Organizational processes (acquisitions, divestitures, governance committees). Be aware of the risks in
acquisitions (since the state of the IT environment to be integrated is unknown, due diligence is critical) and
divestitures (you need to determine how to split the IT infrastructure and what to do with identities and
credentials). Understand the value of governance committees (vendor governance, project governance,
architecture governance, etc.). Executives, managers and appointed individuals meet to review architecture,
projects and incidents (security or otherwise), and provide approvals for new strategies or directions. The goal is a
fresh set of eyes, often eyes that are not purely focused on information security.
 Organizational roles and responsibilities. There are multiple roles to consider. Management has a responsibility
to keep the business running and to maximize profits and shareholder value. The security architect or security
engineer has a responsibility to understand the organization’s business needs, the existing IT environment, and
the current state of security and vulnerability, as well as to think through strategies (improvements, configurations
and countermeasures) that could maximize security and minimize risk. There is a need for people who can translate
between technical and non-technical people. Costs must be justified and reasonable, based on the organization’s
requirements and risk.
 Security control frameworks. A control framework helps ensure that your organization is covering all the bases
around securing the environment. There are many frameworks to choose from, such as Control Objectives for
Information Technology (COBIT) and the ISO 27000 series (27000, 27001, 27002, etc.). These frameworks fall into
four categories:
 Preventative — Preventing security issues and violations through strategies such as policies and security
awareness training
 Deterrent — Discouraging malicious activities using access controls or technologies such as firewalls,
intrusion detection systems and motion-activated cameras
 Detective — Uncovering unauthorized activity in your environment
 Corrective — Getting your environment back to where it was prior to a security incident
 Due care / due diligence. Ensure you understand the difference between these two concepts. Due care is about
your legal responsibility within the law or within organizational policies to implement your organization’s controls,
follow security policies, do the right thing and make reasonable choices. Due diligence is about understanding your
security governance principles (policies and procedures) and the risks to your organization. Due diligence often
involves gathering information through discovery, risk assessments and review of existing documentation; creating
documentation to establish written policies; and disseminating the information to the organization. Sometimes,
people think of due diligence as the method by which due care can be exercised.
After you establish and document a framework for governance, you need security awareness training to bring everything
together. All new hires should complete the security awareness training as they come on board, and existing employees
should recertify on it regularly (typically yearly).

1.3 Determine compliance requirements
Many organizations need to comply with applicable laws and industry standards. Noncompliance can mean fines, jail time
for executives or even the end of a business. To achieve compliance, you must focus on controls. Although most common
standards are vague about implementation, a few provide detailed documentation to help organizations achieve
compliance. For example, NIST provides a guide for complying with federal information standards.
 Contractual, legal, industry standards, and regulatory requirements. Understand the legal systems. Civil law
is most common; rulings from judges typically do not set precedents that impact other cases. With common law,
which is used in the USA, Canada, the UK and former British colonies, rulings from judges can set precedents that
have significant impact on other cases. An example of religious law is Sharia (Islamic law), which use the Qur’an
and Hadith for the foundation of laws. Customary law takes common, local and accepted practices and sometimes
makes them laws. Within common law, you have criminal law (laws against society) and civil law (typically person
vs. person and results in a monetary compensation from the losing party). Compliance factors into laws,
regulations, and industry standards such as Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA), and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). As part of your exam preparation,
familiarize yourself with these standards by reading their high-level summaries.
 Privacy requirements. Privacy is about protection of PII. Laws vary. The European Union has tough laws around
privacy. Be familiar with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Be familiar with the requirements around
healthcare data, credit card data and other PII data as it relates to various countries and their laws and regulations.
1.4 Understand legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information
security in a global context
While you might be familiar with your local legal and regulatory issues, you must be familiar with legal and regulatory issues
elsewhere too, at least at a high level.
 Cyber crimes and data breaches. Before your organization expands to other countries, perform due diligence to
understand their legal systems and what changes might be required to the way that data is handled and secured.
In particular, be familiar with the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, a treaty signed by many countries
that establishes standards for cybercrime policy. Be familiar with the various laws about data breaches, including
notification requirements. In the United States, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health
(HITECH) Act requires notification of a data breach in some cases, such as when the exposed personal health
information was not protected in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) applies to insurance and financial organizations; it requires notification to
federal regulators, law enforcement agencies and customers when a data breach occurs. States in the United States
also impose their own requirements concerning data breaches. The EU and other countries have their own
requirements too. The GDPR has very strict data breach notification requirements: A data breach must be reported
to the competent supervisory authority within 72 hours of its discovery. Some countries do not have any reporting
requirements.
 Licensing and intellectual property requirements. Understand the rules around:
