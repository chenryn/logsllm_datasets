four vendors use only password authorization, typically with a sin-

can be disabled in all four systems. Recently, more access control
capabilities have been added to HMI engineering software. For in-

tal [18] use client-side authentication for individual IDE projects.
Additionally, recent device ﬁngerprinting mechanisms (e.g., [32])
facilitate deployment of higher level access control functionalities
such as CPAC in control systems. Almost none of the existing
control system access control solutions take into consideration the
physical dynamics of the plant while deﬁning or enforcing the poli-
cies. This allows the attacker to completely bypass authentication
by exploiting the physical system’s dynamics and inter-component
interdependencies to disclose sensitive measurements and manipu-
late critical plant actuation points.
Information ﬂow analysis. Many existing solutions have proposed
information ﬂow control [65, 61] and dynamic taint analyzers [20]
for general-purpose computing systems, smartphones [29] and em-
bedded devices [64]. However, they have almost never been used
in real-world control systems, because of i) their high run-time per-
formance overheads limiting their deployability for safety-critical
real-time settings and ii) insufﬁcient accuracy due to fully ignoring
the physical-side information ﬂows. Existing control system data
historians [33] within energy management systems [4] provide a
bulk databases-level ofﬂine information ﬂow control between large
power system areas (control centers). Such coarse-grained solu-
tions i) do not support dynamic and/or ﬁne-grained information
ﬂow control; ii) often result in inﬂexible architectures, i.e., too per-
missive (allow data exchange between two control centers) or re-
strictive (no database exchange allowed); and iv) completely miss
the physical dependencies between various database entries within
and across the control centers.
9. CONCLUSIONS
We present CPAC, a cyber-physical access control solution to
protect industrial control systems against operation mistakes and
insider attacks. CPAC implements lightweight on-device and
mathematically sound physical-side information ﬂow analyses to
maintain a complete system view. It uses physical system model,
information ﬂow tracking, and logic-based context-aware policies
to stop operations which could harm the whole system or leak sen-
sitive information to malicious insiders. Our experimental results
with CPAC’s working prototype on Bachmann PLCs and EMS
servers show that CPAC can terminate several past real control
system incidents and perform N −x contingency analysis with run-
time performance overhead of only 150 ms.

The ﬁrst order taylor series expansion of (2) is given in (6). For
line ﬂow analysis, w is line ﬂow vector and u is the vector of series
capacitor reactances. fx is the jacobian matrix know from Newton-
Raphson and the jacobin matrices wu,wx and fu are shown in Fig-
ure 13.
For higher policy enforcement accuracy via considering higher
order dynamics of the plant, CPAC makes use of second order ap-
proximation as in (8). wxx,wux and wuu are second order jacobian
matrices for line ﬂow analysis are shown in Figure 13.
B. FOUR BUS POWER SYSTEM CASE
STUDY
Case B: Ensuring safe power grid control. The power system is
already in an unsafe state (shown in Figure 11a), where two trans-
mission lines experience high currents. Bob, as the control opera-
tor, asks to increase the generation set-point on power bus 2. Based
on the power system ﬂow equations, this would increase line ﬂows
across the system.
Source of incident: No enforcement of control system integrity.
Required access control policy: In the case of unsafe states, control
operators must not take actions that further worsens the situation
(i.e., increases the overﬂows).
Effects of CPAC deployment: CPAC denies Bob’s request since
his action would violate the policy (Figure 12), because the ac-
tion’s execution drives the system further into less safe states while
the system is already not safe.
Case C: Inter-area power transfer regulation. Alice requests
