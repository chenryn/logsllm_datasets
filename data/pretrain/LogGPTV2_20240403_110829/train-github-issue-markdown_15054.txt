There was class
org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer in
Spring 3.0 M4 with method
           /**
            * Parse the given String value recursively, to be able to resolve
            * nested placeholders (when resolved property values in turn contain
            * placeholders again).
            * @param strVal the String value to parse
            * @param props the Properties to resolve placeholders against
            * @param visitedPlaceholders the placeholders that have already been visited
            * during the current resolution attempt (used to detect circular references
            * between placeholders). Only non-null if we're parsing a nested placeholder.
            * @throws BeanDefinitionStoreException if invalid values are encountered
            * @see #resolvePlaceholder(String, java.util.Properties, int)
            */
           protected String parseStringValue(String strVal, Properties props,
    Set visitedPlaceholders)
               throws BeanDefinitionStoreException {...}
class is still there, but was refactored quite a lot since M4 and above method
with other methods were removed. But in more specific environments, like in
Gigaspace in our case, there is problem with instanciation of the container
because it relies on the method.
With no known workaround for it it's show stopper for deployment project on
Gigaspace platform. It hits all releases since M4.  
(...And I welcome any ideas.)
