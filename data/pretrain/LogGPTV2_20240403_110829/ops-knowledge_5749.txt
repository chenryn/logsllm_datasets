User:  When deploying multiple applications using Docker, a port conflict between containers arose. Please describe how you would solve this problem.
Assistant: To solve the port conflict problem between containers, you can take the following methods: 1. Modify the port of the container. You can bind the service in the container to the specified port of the host by specifying the port when starting the container, for example: ``` docker run -p 8000:80 nginx ``` This binds port 80 in the container to port 8000 of the host, avoiding port conflicts. 2. Use different network modes Docker provides a variety of network modes, such as the default bridge mode, host mode, overlay mode, etc. If you use the default bridge mode, the containers will share the same bridge, which will easily lead to port conflicts. You can use overlay mode or custom network mode to isolate different container networks and avoid port conflicts. 3. Use Docker Compose Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The configuration of multiple containers can be defined through the docker-compose.yml file. In this file, you can set the mapped ports of multiple services to avoid port conflicts. 4. Using a reverse proxy can map ports in different containers to different domain names or paths by deploying a reverse proxy server (such as Nginx) on the host machine, thereby avoiding port conflicts. For example: ``` location /app1 { proxy_pass http://localhost:8000; # The container port of app1 is 8000 } location /app2 { proxy_pass http://localhost:8001; # The container port of app2 is 8001 } ``` The above are some commonly used methods to solve the problem of port conflicts between containers. The specific method to choose can be weighed and selected according to the actual situation.
