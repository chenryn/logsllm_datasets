Hello,
I am not sure this is the right place to post this or if I should create this
on electron-builder, but considering the behavior changed between version 10.x
and 11 of electron it might be relevant. Please tell me if I should open it
elsewhere instead. We are having an issue when building our application with
version 11-beta using electron-builder. We rely on static binaries to be
included in our build (ffmpeg, to name it), but when starting the built app we
get a JS error saying the package.json file for this module is invalid
(Unexpected end of JSON input).
### Expected Behavior
The production application should run similarly to the dev
### Actual Behavior
Production build crashes on start
When looking at the content of the generated .app the (unpacked) app.asar has
properly included the dependencies, and the package.json is valid.
### To Reproduce
The project runs fine on dev, it's the finalized built version that has an
issue. I created a repo with the base project, as well as uploaded the built
version in the 1.0.0 release of this repo.
    $ git clone https://github.com/lmancel/electron-tests.git
    $ yarn install
    $ yarn build
Built binary:  
https://github.com/lmancel/electron-tests/releases/download/1.0.0/electron-
test-1.0.0-mac.zip
