### Generator Powered by an Oxidation Reaction

To extend the lifetime of the Energy Storage Component (ESC), multiple oxygen sensors are employed in sequence. When the active oxygen sensor is depleted, the ESC automatically switches to the next available sensor.

### Fault Detection, Identification, and Repair (FDIR) in the RSVP System

Table 4 outlines the responsibilities for fault detection, identification, and repair (FDIR) in the RSVP system. Each row in the table details the actions taken by a Sensor Cluster (SC) and Access Point (AP) in response to a specific failure. For example, if a passively failed SC is not detected by any other SC, the AP will detect the failure by noticing the absence of data from that SC. Isolation is straightforward, as each SC is assigned a unique slot in the repeating frame. The AP then ceases to use data from the failed SC and eventually reassigns its slot to another SC.

### Maintenance and System Availability

Although zero maintenance is ideal, it is inevitable that some areas will experience more failures or damage than others. A space with insufficient operational equipment would degrade system availability, thereby compromising the ship's mission. Therefore, a study [4] was conducted to assess the impact on availability and operating cost of various repair strategies, assuming a mission duration of 50,000 hours (5.7 years). The three repair strategies compared were:

1. **Repair components as they fail.**
2. **Perform no repair until the amount of functioning equipment in a space is inadequate, then repair just enough components to make the space available again.**
3. **Perform no repair until the amount of functioning equipment in a space is inadequate, then repair all failed components in that one space.**

All three strategies allowed the ship to meet a 0.95 availability standard. The strategy of repairing just enough to make the space available again provided the lowest overall cost.

### FDIR in RSVP (Table 4)

| Failure | FDIR Actions |
|---------|--------------|
| **Sensor Cluster (passive)** | None |
| **If linked to failed AP** | Detect absence of downlink; establish communication with another AP. |
| **If employing affected channel** | Detect absence of downlink; establish communication with another AP. |
| **Access Point (passive)** | SC or AP radio (babbles on a channel or channels, making it or them unusable) |
| **Ship’s LAN** | None |
| **Watchstation** | None |
| **Access Point FDIR** | Detect absence of data; data from absent SC is not used in computations. SC’s assigned slot may be reassigned to another SC. |
| **Detect absence of wired-network messages from failed AP** | If that AP was prime, another becomes prime. |
| **If the failed AP had been communicating with an SHM** | Another AP takes over that communication. |
| **AP using affected channel** | Detects absence of data from SCs, but takes no automatic action. AP can be reprogrammed to use a different channel. |
| **Detect failed transmissions to other APs** | Establish path through network that avoids failed or damaged parts. |
| **None. Crew will switch to another Watchstation, which will subscribe to the data it needs.** | |

### Data Survivability and Communication Protocols

The need for data survivability precluded the use of Aloha for data transmissions between SCs and APs. In high-traffic situations, such as during a fire, multiple SCs transmitting at the highest rate would result in numerous packet collisions and significant data loss. Aloha is acceptable for communication with Personnel Status Monitors (PSMs) because PSM data is most critical when there are few PSM wearers in a particular space.

While beyond the scope of RSVP, an operational system would use encryption in RF links to prevent an enemy from introducing spurious data that could trigger false alarms. The need to protect against jamming was not identified, as an enemy capable of disabling RSVP by transmitting a radio-frequency beacon would likely target the combat system instead.

### Demonstrations

RSVP demonstrated the feasibility of wireless sensing and the low-power electronics necessary for sensors powered by harvested energy. Energy-harvesting devices were deployed on the USS Monterey and showed promise but were found to be inadequate due to issues with power output, device size, and mounting requirements. The MEMS sensors behaved as predicted.

### Conclusions

RSVP demonstrated that wireless sensing is feasible in the naval environment and that MEMS sensors can be effectively employed. Energy-harvesting devices are promising but still immature. Progress is needed in several areas for the RSVP approach to be practical, including the development of low-power, standards-based radios and more advanced MEMS chemical sensors.
