generator  powered  by  an  oxidation  reaction.    To 
extend  the  lifetime  of  the  ESC,  multiple  oxygen 
sensors are employed sequentially.  When the active 
oxygen sensor is depleted, the ESC  switches  to the 
next in line. 
Table  4  gives  the  responsibilities  for  fault  detection, 
identification,  and  repair  (FDIR)  in  the  RSVP  system.  
Each row in the table gives the activities performed by an 
SC  and  AP  as  a  consequence  of  a  particular  failure.  
Taking  the  first  row  of  the  table  as  an  example,  a 
passively failed Sensor Cluster is not detected by any SC.  
The  AP  detects  that  the  SC  has  failed  by  noticing  the 
absence of its data.  Isolation is trivial, because only one 
SC is assigned to use that slot in the repeating frame.  The 
AP ceases to use data from the failed SC, and eventually 
frees up its slot to be assigned to another Sensor Cluster. 
Even  though  zero  maintenance  is  the  ideal,  it  is 
inevitable that some spaces would suffer more failures or 
damage than others.  A space that no longer had enough 
operating  equipment  would  degrade  system  availability, 
which would degrade the ship’s ability to accomplish its 
mission.    Therefore  a  study  was  performed  [4]  to 
determine the impact on availability and operating cost of 
various options, including repair strategies.  Three repair 
strategies were compared, all assuming a mission time of 
50,000 hours (5.7 years): 
·  Repair components as they fail 
·  Perform  no  repair  until  the  amount  of  functioning 
equipment in a space is inadequate, then repair just 
enough  components  to  make  the  space  available 
again 
·  Perform  no  repair  until  the  amount  of  functioning 
equipment  in  a  space  is  inadequate,  then  repair  all 
failed components in that one space 
All three repair strategies allowed the ship to meet an 
0.95 availability standard.  The strategy of repairing just 
enough  to  make  the  space  available  again  provided  the 
lowest overall cost.

None.  Crew will switch to

The  desire  for  data  to  be  survivable  militated  against 
the use of Aloha for data transmissions between SCs and 
APs.    When  multiple  Sensor  Clusters  transmit  at  the 
highest  rate,  such  as  in  a  fire  situation,  there  would  be 
many collisions between packets transmitted by different 
SCs, and therefore much loss of data.  Aloha is acceptable 
for  communication  with  PSMs  because  the  situation  in 
which PSM data is most important is when there are few 
PSM wearers in a particular space.  
While  beyond  the  scope  of  RSVP,  an  operational 
system would use encryption in the RF links.  An enemy 
should  be  denied  the  ability  to  introduce  easily  spurious 
data that would result in a flood of false alarms.   
A need to protect against jamming was not identified.  
An  enemy  who  is  capable  of  disabling  RSVP  by 
transmitting  a  radio-frequency  beacon  would  certainly 
attack the combat system instead. 
3.  DEMONSTRATIONS 
RSVP demonstrated the feasibility of wireless sensing, 
and  of  the  low-power  electronics  necessary  to  enable 
sensors  being  powered  by  harvested  energy.    Energy-
harvesting devices were deployed on the USS Monterey, 
and  were  found  to  be  promising  but  inadequate,  due  to

were simulated by removing power to an AP or SC, and 
correct operation was observed.  SCs acquired initial sync 
when  powered  on  and  acquired  sync  with  another  AP 
when the first AP failed.  APs responded correctly to SC 
failures,  and  transferred  primacy  when  the  prime  AP 
failed.  SHMs switched from communicating with a failed 
AP to one that was working.

There  was  no  need  to  induce  failures  of  the  ship’s 
LAN and Watchstations.  The dependability of the ship’s 
LAN would be well established before being installed as 
part of a ship’s infrastructure.  Computers standing in for 
Watchstations were frequently power cycled in the normal 
course of events with no adverse effect. 
APs performed data fusion and transferred data to the 
Watchstation as appropriate, as well as live and recorded 
video and audio when requested. 
The  Aloha,  time-division  multiplexing,  and  IEEE 
802.11  RF  protocols  operated  successfully  without 
interfering with each other, even though all operate in the 
same 2.4 GHz band.  This RF traffic did not interfere with 
RF  communication  at  any  of  the  demo  sites,  nor  was

to  RF 
RSVP demonstrated that wireless sensing is feasible in 
the  naval  environment,  and  that  MEMS  sensors  can  be 
employed  in  this  capacity.    Energy-harvesting  devices 
were  shown to be promising, but immature.  Progress is 
needed  in  several  areas  for  the  RSVP  approach  to  be 
practical. 
There is a need for low-power, standards-based radios.  
Existing standards-based radios consume too much power 
to be employed in an energy-harvesting situation.   
Energy-harvesting  devices  currently  require  special 
installation  procedures.    To  be  practical,  these  devices 
must be cheap, durable, and capable of being incorporated 
in  a  product  that  has  a  minimal  installation  procedure.  
Failing  that,  alternative  power  sources  such  as  fuel  cells 
and ion generators should be pursued. 
The  lack  of  availability  of  MEMS  chemical  sensors 
limited the degree to which Sensor Cluster size and power 
utilization could be minimized.  Advances are needed to 
produce  MEMS  oxygen,  carbon  monoxide,  carbon 
dioxide, photoelectric, and ionization sensors.
