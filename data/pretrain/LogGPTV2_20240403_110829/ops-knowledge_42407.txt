I am attempting to run Google's DeepDream, but I keep encountering the following error:

```
ImportError: No module named google.protobuf
```

This error occurs when I try to import `protobuf`. I have installed `protobuf` using the command `sudo install protobuf`, and I am running Python 2.7 on macOS Yosemite 10.10.3. The current deployment location is `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages`.

I suspect this might be related to a deployment or permission issue, but I haven't found any relevant information online. 

**Solution:**
In my case, the issue was related to macOS's permission control. To resolve this, I used the following command:

```bash
sudo -H pip3 install protobuf
```

This version is more structured, clear, and professional, making it easier for others to understand and follow.
