### Service Scaling on ACX5048 and ACX5096 Routers

On ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers, typical services such as ELINE, ELAN, and IP VPN may require applications like policers, firewall filters, and connectivity fault management (IEEE 802.1ag, RFC2544) that utilize the dynamic TCAM infrastructure.

**Note:** The scale of these services is limited by the availability of TCAM resources. Therefore, the service scale depends on the TCAM resource consumption by these applications.

A sample use case for monitoring and troubleshooting service scale in ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers can be found in the "Dynamic Ternary Content Addressable Memory Overview" section on page 1382.

### Troubleshooting DNS Name Resolution in Logical System Security Policies

**Problem:**
The address of a hostname in an address book entry used in a security policy might fail to resolve correctly.

**Cause:**
Address book entries with dynamic hostnames typically refresh automatically on SRX Series Firewalls. The TTL field associated with a DNS entry indicates when the entry should be refreshed in the policy cache. If the SRX Series Firewall cannot obtain a response from the DNS server (e.g., due to lost packets or an unresponsive DNS server), the hostname resolution may fail, leading to dropped traffic as no matching security policy or session is found.

**Solution:**
- Use the `show security dns-cache` command to display DNS cache information.
- If the DNS cache needs to be refreshed, use the `clear security dns-cache` command.

**Note:** These commands are only available to the primary administrator on devices configured for logical systems. They are not available in user logical systems or on devices not configured for logical systems.

### Troubleshooting the Link Services Interface

#### Determine Which CoS Components Are Applied to the Constituent Links

**Problem:**
When configuring a multilink bundle, you need to decide whether to apply CoS components to the multilink bundle or its constituent links.

**Solution:**
- Apply a scheduler map to both the multilink bundle and its constituent links.
- Configure only the necessary CoS components to avoid unnecessary delays.

| CoS Component | Multilink Bundle | Constituent Links | Explanation |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Classifier     | Yes              | No                | CoS classification occurs on the incoming side, not the transmitting side. |
| Forwarding Class | Yes             | No                | Forwarding class is associated with a queue, which is applied by a scheduler map. Queue assignment is predetermined on constituent links. |
| Scheduler Map  | Yes              | Yes               | Ensure the relative order of transmit rate and scheduler priority is the same on both. |
| Buffer Size    | Yes              | Yes               | Ensure the buffer size on Q0 of the constituent links is large enough. |
| RED Drop Profile | Yes            | No                | Configure on the multilink bundle only to avoid back pressure on constituent links. |
| Shaping Rate   | No               | Yes               | Per-unit scheduling is applied at the end point, so configure on constituent links. |
| Transmit-Rate Exact | Yes          | No                | Interface-level shaping on the multilink bundle overrides any shaping on the queue. |
| Rewrite Rules  | Yes              | No                | Rewrite bits are copied during fragmentation. |
| Virtual Channel Group | Yes        | No                | Identified through firewall filter rules applied before the multilink bundle. |

### Determine What Causes Jitter and Latency on the Multilink Bundle

**Problem:**
Jitter and latency increase after configuring LFI and CRTP, even over a non-congested link.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure a shaping rate is configured on each constituent link.
2 | Ensure no shaping rate is configured on the link services interface.
3. Ensure the shaping rate value matches the physical interface bandwidth.
4. If jitter persists, contact the Juniper Networks Technical Assistance Center (JTAC).

### Determine If LFI and Load Balancing Are Working Correctly

**Problem:**
Verify that voice packets are transmitted with minimal delay and jitter, and load balancing is performed correctly.

**Solution:**
1. **Verify packet fragmentation:**
   - Use the `show interfaces lsq-0/0/0` command to check if large packets are fragmented correctly.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     user@R0#> show interfaces lsq-0/0/0
     Physical interface: lsq-0/0/0, Enabled, Physical link is Up
     ...
     Output: 1100 0 118800 0
     Packets:
     Output: 1000 0 112000 0
     ...
     ```

2. **Verify packet encapsulation:**
   - Determine the encapsulation type (PPP for LFI, MLPPP for non-LFI).
   - Use the `show interfaces queue` command to compare packet sizes and determine encapsulation overhead.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Table 156: PPP and MLPPP Encapsulation Overhead
     Packet Type | Encapsulation | Initial Encapsulation Overhead | Packet Size after Encapsulation
     Voice packet (LFI) | PPP | 70 bytes | 77 bytes
     Data fragment (non-LFI) | MLPPP | 70 bytes | 83-85 bytes
     ```

3. **Verify load balancing:**
   - Use the `show interfaces queue` command on the multilink bundle and its constituent links to confirm load balancing.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     user@R0> show interfaces queue lsq-0/0/0
     ...
     Queue: 2, Forwarding classes: VOICE
     Transmitted:
     Packets : 400 0 pps
     Bytes : 61344 0 bps
     ...
     user@R0> show interfaces queue se-1/0/0
     ...
     Queue: 2, Forwarding classes: VOICE
     Transmitted:
     Packets : 100 0 pps
     Bytes : 15272 0 bps
     ...
     user@R0> show interfaces queue se-1/0/1
     ...
     Queue: 2, Forwarding classes: VOICE
     Transmitted:
     Packets : 100 0 pps
     Bytes : 15272 0 bps
     ...
     ```
