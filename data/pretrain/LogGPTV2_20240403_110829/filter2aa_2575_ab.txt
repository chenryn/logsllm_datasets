### Managing Scripts in Cobalt Strike

To manage scripts, navigate to **Cobalt Strike -> Script Manager**.

**Figure 8. Script Manager**

Cobalt Strike includes a default script that defines all of the application's popup menus and formats information displayed in its consoles. Using the Aggressor Script engine, you can override these defaults and customize Cobalt Strike to your preferences. Additionally, Aggressor Script can be used to add new features to Cobalt Strike’s Beacon and automate certain tasks.

#### 2.3 Session and Target Visualizations

Cobalt Strike provides several visualizations to assist different aspects of your engagement. You can switch between these visualizations using the toolbar or the **Cobalt Strike -> Visualization** menu.

##### Targets Table

The Targets Table displays the targets in Cobalt Strike’s data model, including IP addresses, NetBIOS names, and notes assigned by you or your team members. The icon to the left of a target indicates its operating system, and a red icon with lightning bolts signifies that the target has an associated Cobalt Strike Beacon session.

**Figure 10. Cobalt Strike Targets View**

- Click on any table header to sort the hosts.
- Highlight a row and right-click to bring up a menu with options for that host.
- Use **Ctrl + Alt** and click to select and deselect individual hosts.

The Targets Table is useful for lateral movement and understanding the target network.

##### Sessions Table

The Sessions Table shows which Beacons are communicating with this Cobalt Strike instance. Here, you can see the external and internal IP addresses, the egress listener, the last call time, and other information. The icon next to each row indicates the operating system of the compromised target. A red icon with lightning bolts means the Beacon is running with administrator privileges, while a faded icon indicates that the Beacon session was asked to exit and acknowledged the command.

**Figure 11. Cobalt Strike Beacon Management Tool**

- If using a DNS Beacon listener, note that Cobalt Strike will not have information about a host until it checks in for the first time.
- Right-click one or more Beacons to see post-exploitation options.

##### Pivot Graph

Cobalt Strike allows you to chain multiple Beacons, where linked Beacons receive commands and send output through their parent Beacon. This chaining is useful for controlling which sessions egress a network and emulating disciplined actors who restrict communication paths within a network.

**Figure 12. Cobalt Strike Graph View**

- Each Beacon session is represented by an icon indicating the operating system.
- A firewall icon represents the egress point of the Beacon payload.
- Dashed green lines indicate HTTP/HTTPS connections, while yellow dashed lines indicate DNS connections.
- Arrows connecting Beacon sessions represent links, with orange arrows for named pipe channels and blue arrows for TCP socket channels. Red (named pipe) or purple (TCP) arrows indicate broken links.

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Ctrl + Plus**: Zoom in
- **Ctrl + Minus**: Zoom out
- **Ctrl + 0**: Reset zoom level
- **Ctrl + A**: Select all hosts
- **Escape**: Clear selection
- **Ctrl + C**: Arrange hosts into a circle
- **Ctrl + S**: Arrange hosts into a stack
- **Ctrl + H**: Arrange hosts into a hierarchy

Right-click the Pivot Graph with no selected Beacons to configure the layout and hide or show unlinked sessions.

#### 2.4 Tabs

Cobalt Strike opens dialogs, consoles, and tables in tabs. Use the following actions to manage tabs:

- **X button**: Close a tab
- **Ctrl + D**: Close the active tab
- **Ctrl + Shift + D**: Close all tabs except the active one
- **Right-click X button**: Open a tab in a window, take a screenshot, or close all tabs with the same name

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- **Ctrl + W**: Open the active tab in its own window
- **Ctrl + T**: Save a screenshot of the active tab
- **Ctrl + B**: Send the current tab to the bottom of the Cobalt Strike window
- **Ctrl + E**: Remove the tab from the bottom
- **Shift + X**: Close all tabs with the same name
- **Shift + Ctrl + X**: Open the tab in its own window
- **Ctrl + Left/Right**: Switch tabs
- **Drag and drop**: Change tab order

#### 2.5 Consoles

Cobalt Strike provides a console for interacting with Beacon sessions, scripts, and chatting with teammates.

**Figure 13. A Console Tab**

- **Command history**: Use the up arrow to cycle through previously typed commands, and the down arrow to return to the last command.
- **Tab key**: Complete commands and parameters
- **Ctrl + Plus/Minus/0**: Adjust font size
- **Ctrl + F**: Search for text within the console
- **Ctrl + A**: Select all text in the console’s buffer

#### 2.6 Tables

Cobalt Strike uses tables to display sessions, credentials, targets, and other engagement information. Most tables allow you to assign color highlights to rows, which are visible to other Cobalt Strike clients.

**Figure 14. Table with Search Panel**

- **Ctrl + F**: Show the table search panel to filter the current table
- **Text field**: Type your filter criteria using appropriate formats (e.g., CIDR notation, numbers, wildcards)
- **! button**: Negate the current criteria
- **Enter**: Apply the specified criteria
- **Reset button**: Remove applied filters

### 3. Data Management

#### 3.1 Overview

Cobalt Strike’s team server acts as a broker for information collected during your engagement. It parses Beacon output to extract targets, services, and credentials. You can export Cobalt Strike’s data through **Reporting -> Export Data**, with options for TSV and XML formats.

#### 3.2 Targets

Interact with Cobalt Strike’s target information through **View -> Targets**. This tab displays the same information as the Targets Visualization.

- **Import**: Import a file with target information (flat text or Nmap XML)
- **Add**: Add new targets to Cobalt Strike’s data model
- **Save**: Hold shift to keep the dialog open when adding hosts

**Figure 15. Add a Target**

- **Right-click menu**: Change notes, set operating system information, or remove hosts

#### 3.3 Services

From the Targets display, right-click a host and select **Services** to open the Services browser. Here, you can browse services, assign notes, and remove service entries.

**Figure 16. The Services Dialog**

#### 3.4 Credentials

Interact with Cobalt Strike’s credential model through **View -> Credentials**.

- **Add**: Add a new entry
- **Copy**: Copy highlighted entries to the clipboard
- **Export**: Export credentials in PWDump format

**Figure 17. The Credential Model**

#### 3.5 Maintenance

Cobalt Strike’s data model is stored in the `data/` folder. To clear the data model, stop the team server, delete the `data/` folder, and restart the server. For archiving, stop the team server, store the `data/` folder, and restore it when needed.

- **Reporting -> Reset Data**: Resets Cobalt Strike’s Data Model without a team server restart

### 4. Listener and Infrastructure Management

#### 4.1 Overview

Setting up infrastructure is the first step in any engagement. In Cobalt Strike, this includes team servers, redirectors, and DNS records. Once the team server is running, configure it to receive connections from compromised systems using listeners.

A listener configures a payload and directs Cobalt Strike to set up a server to receive connections from that payload. A listener consists of a user-defined name, payload type, and payload-specific options.

#### 4.2 Listener Management

Manage Cobalt Strike listeners through **Cobalt Strike -> Listeners**.

**Figure 18. Listener Management Tab**

- **Add**: Create a new listener
- **Edit**: Modify an existing listener
- **Remove**: Delete a listener

#### 4.3 Cobalt Strike’s Beacon Payload

Most commonly, you will configure listeners for the Beacon payload, which models advanced attackers. Beacon supports asynchronous and interactive communication and can egress over HTTP, HTTPS, or DNS. You can also control peer-to-peer Beacons over Windows named pipes and TCP sockets.

Beacon’s network indicators are malleable, allowing you to redefine communication using Cobalt Strike’s Malleable C2 language. This feature is discussed in Chapter 11.

#### 4.4 Payload Staging

Payload staging is necessary in some offense actions due to hard limits on data that can be loaded into memory after exploitation. Cobalt Strike uses staging in user-driven attacks, such as those under **Attacks -> Packages** and **Attacks -> Web Drive-by**.

- **Disable staging**: Set the `host_stage` option in your Malleable C2 profile to `false` to prevent Cobalt Strike from hosting payload stages on its web and DNS servers.
- **Post-exploitation and lateral movement**: In Cobalt Strike 4.0 and later, these actions deliver full payloads where possible, minimizing the need for stagers.

#### 4.5 HTTP Beacon and HTTPS Beacon

HTTP and HTTPS Beacons download tasks with HTTP GET requests and send data back with HTTP POST requests. You can configure these through **Cobalt Strike -> Listeners**.

**Figure 19. HTTP Beacon Options**

- **Add/Remove/Clear hosts**: Manage callback hosts
- **HTTP Host (Stager)**: Specify the host for the HTTP Stager
- **Profile**: Select a Malleable C2 profile variant
- **HTTP Port (C2)**: Set the port for the HTTP Beacon to phone home
- **HTTP Port (Bind)**: Specify the port for the HTTP Beacon payload web server
- **HTTP Host Header**: Propagate this value to HTTP stagers and communication
- **HTTP Proxy**: Configure an explicit proxy for the payload

**Manual HTTP Proxy Configuration**

**Figure 20. Manual Proxy Settings**

- **Type**: Configure the proxy type
- **Host and Port**: Specify the proxy location
- **Username and Password**: Optional fields for proxy authentication
- **Ignore proxy settings**: Force direct connection
- **Set/Reset**: Update or reset the proxy configuration

Note: The manual proxy configuration affects only the HTTP and HTTPS Beacon payload stages, not the payload stagers.
