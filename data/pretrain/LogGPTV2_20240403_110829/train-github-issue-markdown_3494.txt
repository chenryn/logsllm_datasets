Hi,
Just a thought that came to my mind as I have to do it several times,
shouldn't the pulls floating be removed for mobile devices or at least 320px
width?
Reason:  
On smaller devices, there is no point in floating the elements in most cases
(at least 80%) as display block are generally used on this small screens.
