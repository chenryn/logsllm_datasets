I don't know who's making the bug, so reporting here. I'll move to correct
repo if someone helps me debug it.

  1. Goto https://react-devtools-tutorial.now.sh/editing-props-and-state
  2. Change the last ListItem prop to isComplete from `false` to `true`.
  3. Click the checkbox in the view to change the state again from `true` to `false`.  
**What is the expected behavior?**  
It should just change the state of that ListItem. Instead, it's adding 3 more
in the list with duplicate keys.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
