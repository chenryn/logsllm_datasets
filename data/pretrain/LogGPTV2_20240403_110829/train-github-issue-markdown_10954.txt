### Issue Description

**What Happened**:

When the `scheduler` is restarted, currently running tasks encounter a `SIGTERM` error. Every time the `scheduler` is restarted or redeployed, the existing `scheduler` is terminated, and a new `scheduler` is created. If there are tasks running during this process, the new `scheduler` will terminate these tasks with a `complete` status and create new tasks to continue their work. However, after a few seconds, the new tasks are terminated with an `error` status and a `SIGTERM` error.

**Error Log**:
```

```

**Expected Behavior**:

- The currently running tasks should be allowed to complete their processes, or the substitute tasks should execute successfully.
- The new `scheduler` should not interfere with the running tasks.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Start a DAG that includes one or more tasks that take several minutes to complete.
2. During the processing of these tasks, execute a new deployment for the `scheduler`.
3. Observe that the current `scheduler` is terminated and a new one is created.
4. Notice that the current tasks are marked as `completed` (without finishing their processing) and are replaced by new tasks.
5. The new tasks will fail within seconds, showing a `SIGTERM` error.

### Additional Information

- This issue did not occur with Airflow 1.10.15 and started after upgrading to Airflow 2.1.0.
