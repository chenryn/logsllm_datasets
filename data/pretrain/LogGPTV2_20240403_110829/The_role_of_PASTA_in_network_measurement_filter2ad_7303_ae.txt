PASTA continues to hold for delay, despite the dangerous periodic
components of cross-trafﬁc, but that inversion bias is a problem.
4.2 Controlling Intrusiveness
One strategy to reach the objective of Equation (7) is to use a
minimally perturbative stream to reduce bias (e.g., [23]). When
packet sizes cannot be made arbitrarily small, non-intrusiveness
can be achieved by ‘rare probing’, i.e., making the inter-arrival
times large. The aim of the present section is to give a justiﬁca-
tion of this strategy in a limited but natural setting.
Setting: We assume that the queueing system without probes
is described by a Markov kernel in continuous time, Ht, on some
denumerable state space E that is irreducible and positive recurrent
with stationary probability π. We assume that the transmission of a
probe is represented by applying another Markov kernel K; more
precisely, if the state of the system just before a probe is sent is
described by the probability measure ν on E, then the law of the
state of the system when this probe reaches the receiver is νK (also
on E). Probe n + 1 is sent a random time aτ after n is received,
where a ∈ R
+. Hence,
the probes are not renewal.
+ is a scaling factor and τ has law I on R
The Markov kernel of the total system (describing the law of the
system just before probes are sent) is given by

Notice that the above limit implies that both inversion and sampling
bias go to zero.
Our theorem, valid for delay only, and under a particular set of
conditions, is only an indication of the kind of result that could be
obtained based on ‘rarity’. There is much scope for future work in
this technically challenging area.
4.3 A Replacement for Poisson Probing
In active probing practice, PASTA has been employed either as
a default choice, or in the belief that it will lead to zero estima-
tion bias, and always in the expectation that it can do no harm.
We claim that there is little justiﬁcation in applying PASTA in the
overwhelming majority of situations, and consequently that Pois-
son probing as a default is both undeserved and misleading, and
should be replaced. We recap the case against Poisson probing
before suggesting what it could be replaced with. As a detailed
summary already appears in the introduction, here we present an
account focusing on practical implications.
Inﬂexibility: NIMASTA and rare probing show that there is a
large class of probing streams which avoid both sampling bias (if
intrusiveness is controlled) and the possibility of phase-locking.
Poisson probing is a lost opportunity to explore this space to mini-
mize inversion bias as well as variance.
Inapplicability to probe patterns: The techniques of active prob-
ing are rarely based on isolated probes. Section 3.4 showed that
NIMASTA is useful for (mixing) probe patterns, which could be
crafted to achieve given measurement aims. Naturally, Poisson
probes cannot form patterns with desired properties. Exponen-
tially distributed probe pattern inter-arrivals have been suggested
for packet pairs [20], and packet trains [9]. However, there is no
theoretical rationale for this. In active probing PASTA applies only
to a stream of Poisson packets, and cannot justify any inference
based on temporal behaviour between probes of a pair, where inter-
actions are not memoryless.
Beyond delay, inversion bias dominates: The techniques of ac-
tive probing frequently look beyond end-to-end delay. As the tar-
get Z∗(t) moves from the observable itself to quantities which are
far removed from it (such as details of CT at individual hops), the
inversion task becomes increasingly complex. Even in the non-
intrusive case, complex inversion is required (which if poorly per-
formed results in large inversion bias) except in very special cases
such the system end-to-end delay. PASTA does not solve this prob-
lem, indeed Poisson probing prevents probe patterns from being
designed which could help circumvent the hard inversion problem.
There is no single probing guideline which offers optimality for
all probing purposes, and in particular, it is beyond the scope of this
paper to derive optimal probe patterns. Instead, we wish to provide
a new default for probe sending to replace exponential separation in
contexts where the sending of many separate probe patterns applies.
We seek the following features:
• Suitable for separating probe patterns, not only probes,
• Generic, to allow freedom in probe pattern design: we spec-
• Compatible with mixing, to reduce the risk of phase-lock,
• Tunable, to enable bias/variance tradeoffs.
ify pattern separations, not the entire process,
The following choice satisﬁes these criteria:
Probe Pattern Separation Rule: select inter-probe (or probe pat-
tern) separations as i.i.d. positive random variables, with a dis-
tribution which contains an interval where the density is bounded
above zero, and whose support is lower bounded away from zero.
In the special case where each probe pattern is a single probe, this
separation rule fully speciﬁes a probing arrival process, namely a
mixing renewal process. An example is given by the renewal pro-
cess with inter-arrivals uniformly distributed over [0.9μ, 1.1μ] of
Figure 6. Since the support is lower bounded at 0.9μ, probes are
guaranteed to be well separated, enabling them to act more inde-
pendently, thereby reducing variance. Whereas the mean separa-
tion μ can be used to control probe rarity, the lower bound (and
distribution shape) can be tuned to tradeoff sampling bias, inver-
sion bias and variance.
In the case of probe patterns, the rule does not by itself specify
the probe process, nor, therefore, determine all of its properties.
However, selecting separations to be i.i.d. inherently ‘encourages’
mixing (recall section 3.4 in the non-intrusive case). Again, the
enforced separation helps the patterns to make uncorrelated mea-
surements, reducing variance. Finally, note that the support can
be tuned close to zero if necessary, so Poisson-like probing is not
excluded, for the (rare) cases where this is truly appropriate.
5. RELATED WORK
The problem of identifying the conditions under which observa-
tions of a stochastic system coincide with the stationary distribution
of the observed process has a long history, starting with Descloux
in 1967 [4]. Wolff named, gave the ﬁrst rigorous proof for, and
popularized the PASTA principle [22], although that principle was
known earlier. Refer to [11] for a thorough review of pre-1990
work. Melamed and Whitt [11] later derived conditions for ASTA
(Arrivals that See Time Averages) to hold.
The use of PASTA to justify network measurements of at Pois-
son epochs was pioneered by Paxson. He [13, 14], carried out mea-
surements of the “routing state”, delays, losses and TCP bulk trans-
fers at Poisson epochs. The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM)
Group [7] built upon PASTA and Paxson’s results to recommend
the use of Poisson sampling, for example in RFC 2330 [15]. RFC
2330 also observes that non-Poisson probes such as uniform, geo-
metric, additive random, or other probes can be used for a variety of
practical reasons; for example, the interval between Poisson probes
can be arbitrarily large or small, and such probes cannot be im-
plemented in real systems, hence the need to use implementable
and “close enough to Poisson” probes such as truncated Poisson
probes. Note that all the probing processes mentioned above have
the mixing property required for the NIMASTA theorem to hold.
Since then, Poisson probing has become part of the conventional
wisdom of network measurements [23, 20, 9]. Recent work has
attempted to better understand the impact of PASTA and the design
of estimators for active probing. Bin Tariq et al. [12] empirically
examined the difference between Poisson and periodic sampling,
and show that, in many cases, the difference between estimates of
delay and loss obtained with Poisson and periodic probes are not
signiﬁcant. Sommers et al. [19] set out to understand the probing
process best suited to measure packet loss. They propose the use of
a geometrically distributed packet pair to estimate the duration of
loss periods better than can be done with Poisson probes. Roughan
analyzed the Poisson probing of queueing systems and the impact
of correlations in the observed (delay) process [18, 17]. Roughan’s
work is another step towards developing estimators that take not
just bias but also variance into account.
There is a substantial literature on perturbation analysis (see [6])
which addresses the ‘reversed’ problem of determining the behav-
ior of a perturbed system from that of the unperturbed one. How-
ever, there are no immediate or simple answers to the difﬁcult inver-
sion problems of active probing, for example as explored in [10].
6. CONCLUSION
We provide a rigorous analysis of the precise role and relevance
of PASTA in designing estimators for network measurement. Con-
ventional wisdom holds that Poisson sampling must be used to
avoid bias, and the PASTA property is cited as justiﬁcation. Us-
ing end-to-end delay as a tractable example, we show that this is
simplistic, and ignores two important crucial aspects of probing -
inversion to the parameter of interest, and intrusiveness. We derive
’NIMASTA’, the fact that zero sampling bias is shared by a large
set of mixing probing processes in the non-intrusive case, which
also avoid phase-lock problems. The zero estimation bias property
is exclusive to Poisson only when probes are intrusive. However,
it is extremely challenging to invert from observed delay values to
the target parameter, resulting in inversion bias, which can dom-
inate over sampling bias. Hence, even with Poisson probes, it is
desirable to make them non-intrusive, by sending them as rarely as
possible, and we give a theorem making this precise. In the rare
case however (as well as generally) the choice of the best prob-
ing stream is dependent on the total bias (sampling and inversion)
and variance, and furthermore, we explain why PASTA cannot be
used to justify exponentially separated packet pairs or trains. We
conclude that Poisson probing is rarely indicated, and recommend
a Probe Pattern Separation Rule as an alternative default for both
probes and probe patterns, which offers several advantages.
7. APPENDIX
Sketch of proof of Theorem 4 The idea of the proof is: if probes
are separated by a time which is long compared to the ”speed of
convergence to steady state” of the unperturbed system, then probes
should sample a distribution close to that of the unperturbed sys-
tem. To make this rigorous, we need assumptions on the speed of
this convergence. The Doeblin property is one such assumption.
Let α ∈ (0, 1). A Markov P kernel is α-Doeblin if it can be rep-
resented in the form P = (1−α)A+αQ where Q is some Markov
kernel on E and A is a rank 1 Markov kernel, namely the matrix A
has all its lines equal. A sufﬁcient condition for a Markov kernel
P to be α-Doeblin is that ∀j, P (i, j) ≥ (1 − α)φ(j) uniformly
on i, for some probability measure φ on E. Our assumption is that
the Markov kernel J of the embedded chain of Ht is s.t. J n is
α-Doeblin for some constant 0  0.
The proof relies on the following classical properties, where ||.||

||νP n − κ|| ≤ αn||ν − κ|| (this follows from (2)). This uniform
contraction property gives the uniform speed of convergence al-
luded to above. (4) If K is an arbitrary Markov kernel on E and H
is α-Doeblin, then KH and HK are both α-Doeblin.
R
We will also use the following lemma, which shows that any
probability measure which is ”nearly invariant” w.r.t. an α-Doeblin
Markov kernel is close to the invariant measure of this kernel:
LEMMA 7.1. If P is an α-Doeblin Markov kernel with station-
ary distribution π and if ν is a probability measure such that ||ν −
νP|| ≤ , then ||π − ν|| ≤ /(1 − α).
||π − ν|| = ||π − νP + νP − ν|| ≤
The proof follows from:
||πP − νP|| + ||νP − ν|| ≤ α||π − ν|| + .

The ﬁrst step to prove Theorem 4 is to show that, ∀a large enough,
HatI(dt) is β-Doeblin for some coefﬁcient β that does
not depend on a. Let B be a Borel set of R such that I(B) > 0 and
such that b, the inﬁnimum of the points of B, is positive (such a set
exists because of our assumption on I). In view of the exponential
law of the sojourn times in the state of the continuous time Markov
chain {Ht}, there is a probability q > 0 that there are n jumps of
the chain in the interval [0, b]. Hence for a > 1:

Enhancements to NS-2 to measure ground truth Z∗(t)
Using the traces of all arrivals and departures from a single hop,
we store the queue size Wh(t) of hop h at any time t by exploiting
the fact that it is piecewise linear. The Wi(t) are combined over
hops to calculate Zp(t), the delay that a packet of size p injected
at an arbitrary time t would have experienced. If Dh denotes the
propagation delay of hop h, then Zp(t) is given recursively by
Zp(t) = W1(t) + p/C1 + D1 +
W2(t + W1(t) + p/C1 + D1) + p/C2 + D2 +
W3(. . .) . . .
