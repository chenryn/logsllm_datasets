User: I'm trying to develop a cross-platform library and want to be able to develop code and then quickly test it on both Windows and Linux. I'm not sure if it's even an option or worthwhile testing under Wine (it uses the multiprocessing module, and COM on Windows) but I do have a VM I've been running it under. It's just been cumbersome getting the code copied over to the Windows machine running on a remote server using the Windows GUI (which is slow enough over the network as it is) after every change, then bringing up the command prompt and running the tests, then troubleshooting on Windows and getting the fixes back to the development environment.
Is there any way I can remove some steps from the testing process?
Assistant: Using a DVCS to push the local changes to the server will take you far. You will need a SSH server on the Windows machine, but there are several of those around. You can also use a makefile to direct the pushing and testing, possibly even running the tests remotely depending on what they consist of.
