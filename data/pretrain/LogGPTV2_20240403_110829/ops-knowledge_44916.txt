Log in to the Azure management portal and select the "Virtual Network" tab. 2. Click the "New Virtual Network" button, fill in the virtual network name, address range, subnet and other information, and create a virtual network after confirmation. 3.

When creating the virtual machine, select the "Connect via a virtual network" option and select the virtual network and subnet you just created. 6. Configure other parameters of the virtual machine, including the size, storage, and operating system of the virtual machine. 7. After the virtual machine is created, log in to the virtual machine and configure networking. 8. Verify that the virtual machine has successfully joined the virtual network. The above are the brief steps for deploying a virtual network on the Azure cloud and adding multiple virtual machines to the network. The exact steps may vary depending on your specific needs.
