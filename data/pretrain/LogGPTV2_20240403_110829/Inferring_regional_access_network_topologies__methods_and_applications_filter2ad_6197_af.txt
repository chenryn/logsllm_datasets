A ETHICS CONSIDERATIONS
A.1 Transportation of Lithium Batteries
In the US, lithium batteries are considered hazardous materials, and
shipment of them must comply with regulations set out by the US
Department of Transportation (i.e. US 49 CFR §172.185 [50]). The
relatively low capacity of batteries in smartphones, and the fact
that they are contained within equipment (i.e., the smartphone),
allows for them to be shipped by ground. Rules about shipment
of a powered-on devices however, are not clearly specified. We
734
are aware of a device with a similar operating mode that is widely
in use today: shipment tracking devices that use Cellular radios
and GPS to report package locations during shipment. One is even
available directly from the US Postal Service [31].
Our institution’s shipment coordinator—who routinely deals
with shipments of hazardous materials such as medical supplies—
contacted the US Department of Transportation for clarification on
shipping powered-on smartphones. They confirmed that as long
as the smartphones do not create a dangerous evolution of heat, or
have the risk of catching fire while in transit, shipping powered on
devices is permitted. To ensure there were no hazardous conditions
our devices could enter while running this software, we thoroughly
tested our smartphones in extreme environmental conditions that
could be experienced during shipment in trucks/railcars. We op-
erated the at 44° C, and -2° C and for several hours while running
our measurement, and the phone continued to operate properly.
The smartphones we use also have an automatic thermal shutdown
feature as an additional safeguard [56].
A.2 Characterizing Critical Infrastructure
Although this study does not involve experiments with human
subjects, there are sensitivities with revealing information about
critical infrastructure that may provide advantages to adversarial
actors.
Although the Belmont report outlined principles relating to hu-
man subjects, the 2012 Menlo Report proposed a framework specifi-
cally targeting computer and information technology research [32].
Its companion report provided a set of case studies applying the
framework [19]. The Menlo Report is a more appropriate frame-
work for our analysis because it explicitly addresses stakeholders
such as network/platform owners and providers but also acknowl-
edges that they may warrent different consideration from that of
individuals.
Our considered view is that the benefit of our research exceeds
potential risk to infrastructure. We are now entirely dependent on
this infrastructure but there has been little attention to indepen-
dent objective understanding of its resilience and reliability. Given
increasing attention to the need for regulatory oversight of the
Internet as critical infrastructure, it is important to understand just
how much a capable independent third party can accurately infer
about various aspects of Internet infrastructure. We need to un-
derstand this capabilities in order to know what adversarial actors
could likely achieve, as well as to know how benign actors might
help to reduce the burdens of government by providing indepen-
dent confirmation of claims of reliability and/or resilience of critical
network infrastructure.
We also have long-standing cordial relationships with engineers
at the providers we have studied, who are aware and supportive of
our work. Specifically, we discussed our inferences with Comcast,
Charter, AT&T, and T-Mobile engineers throughout our study, for
the purposes of validation of our findings.

map IP addresses to COs, and account for outdated and miss-
ing information.
B DETAILS ABOUT COMCAST AND CHARTER
MAPPING
B.1 Mapping IP Addresses to Hostnames
The traceroute probing yields IP address paths, and we attempt
to map each individual addresses to a backbone or regional CO.
We use both dig and the Rapid7 rDNS dataset to perform reverse
lookups on the addresses, prioritizing the dig names to reduce
potentially stale names in Rapid7. Comcast and Charter appear to
connect both their backbone and regional routers with point-to-
point links, so we also lookup names for all IP addresses in the same
/30 subnet as a traceroute IP address. The /30 subnet includes all
addresses possibly used in a point-to-point link with that address.
Using regular expressions, we extract CO and region identifiers
from the names, creating an initial mapping from IP addresses to
COs. We perform two steps to improve the CO mappings to account
for missing and outdated rDNS names (Table 3): (1) resolve router
aliases to map groups of addresses to COs, and (2) add additional
constraints using point-to-point subnet addresses.
First, we use Mercator and Midar alias resolution to infer ad-
dresses that belong to the same router, since these addresses reside
in the same CO. We included all of the traceroute addresses, as well
as the additional addresses in their /30 subnets. If more addresses
in an inferred router map to one CO than any other CO, we remap
all addresses in the group to that CO. We do not apply a minimum
threshold for the number of router IP address hostnames containing
a CO identifier. In the event of tie, we remove all CO mappings
for the addresses to avoid potentially misleading information. The
alias resolution modified or added more CO mappings for Comcast
(5.1%) than Charter (1.9%).
Next, we use point-to-point subnets to further refine the CO
mappings. Interconnected router interfaces must have IP addresses
from the same IP subnet, and network operators usually assign these
addresses from a point-to-point subnet; e.g., /30 or /31 subnets in
IPv4, both of which include two usable interface addresses. Based on
the IP addresses in our traceroutes, it appears that Comcast typically
uses /30 subnets, while Charter uses /31 subnets to interconnect
routers in different COs. Routers typically respond to traceroute
Figure 19: The two paths reveal 𝑥 followed by two different
addresses, 𝑦 and 𝑧. Presuming that 𝑦 and 𝑧 belong to /30 sub-
nets, we use the other address in each subnet (𝑦′ and 𝑧′) to
correct the CO mapping for 𝑥.
with the inbound interface address, so the other address in the point-
to-point subnet often belongs to the router at the prior traceroute
hop. If that other address has a CO mapping provided by rDNS or
alias resolution, we can use that information to refine the mapping
for the prior hop.
Fig. 19 illustrates our approach to using point-to-point IP subnets
to further refine the CO mappings with two traceroutes through a
router in a regional access network, and initial CO mappings for
each of the addresses. The initial mappings indicate that IP address
𝑥 belongs to a router in CO1, but both paths reveal subsequent
addresses where the other address in each subnet (𝑦′ and 𝑧′) map to
CO2. 𝑦′ and 𝑧′ most likely belong to the same router as 𝑥, so we use
them as possible indications that we initially mapped 𝑥 incorrectly.
Here, more addresses map to CO2 than CO1, so we re-map 𝑥 to
CO2. If 𝑥 lacked an initial CO mapping, then we would use the
mappings for 𝑦′ and 𝑧′ to infer a mapping for 𝑥.
B.2 Removing CO Adjacencies
Initially, we collect all immediate IP address adjacencies where
both addresses have a CO mapping (Table 4). MPLS tunnels can
cause false links to appear in traceroute, so we use the approach by
Vanaubel et al. [72] to reveal MPLS exits and the tunnel IP addresses
by conducting follow-up traceroutes to all IP addresses mapped
to COs in the original traceroute collection. If a pair of addresses
appears adjacent in our initial probing, but are separated by one or
more hops in the additional MPLS traceroutes, we remove the pair
since it is likely the entry and exit of an MPLS tunnel. In our maps,
we only observed MPLS tunnel behavior in one Charter region,
although we observed this behavior throughout the region.
Although we attempt to adjust outdated rDNS CO references,
outdated CO mappings remain problematic. To combat some of the
stale CO mappings, we remove any adjacencies where each address
maps to a CO in a different regional network. Prior knowledge of
the extensive use of aggregation in each region, and conversations
with network operators, indicated that a small number of entries

into each region exist, so we remove likely invalid cross-region
adjacencies. This removed far more of the unique CO adjacencies
for Comcast than for Charter, likely due to more outdated rDNS in
Comcast, although the cross-region CO adjacencies accounted for
less than 5% of the IP adjacencies in both networks. We also remove
adjacencies representing potential entries from the backbone into
each region, where one of the IP addresses map to a backbone PoP,
and we infer entries into each region in §5.2.5.
Finally, we remove any CO adjacencies that only appear once
in the traceroute paths. Traceroute output occasionally contains
anomalous output that results from network path changes during
the probing. When COs appear interconnected in only one tracer-
oute path, we conclude that the apparent interconnection might
result from anomalous traceroute output, so we remove them. This
removed 55 CO adjacencies for Comcast, and 9 for Charter.
B.3 Refining Region Graphs
After removing likely invalid adjacencies, we use the remaining ad-
jacencies to create graphs of each regional network, with a directed
edge from one CO to another corresponding to each CO adjacency.
Access networks in the US generally use a star topology to connect
EdgeCOs, so we attempt to conform our revealed CO topology to a
star topology. The revealed topologies still contain noise, primarily
in the form of misleading rDNS creating false adjacencies between
EdgeCOs, as well as unrevealed CO interconnections. Our goal is to
modify the graphs to conform to the likely physical star topology
with as few modifications as possible.
First, we infer the cores of the stars; i.e., the AggCOs in each
region. We expect that AggCOs should have more outgoing edges
than other COs in the region, despite false CO adjacencies and some
EdgeCOs actually connected only to another EdgeCO. To separate
likely AggCOs from EdgeCOs we consider any CO with more than
the mean outgoing edges plus one standard deviation a AggCO.
We then enforce the role of the AggCOs by removing any (𝑥, 𝑦)
edge from one EdgeCO to another EdgeCO, unless 𝑥 has multiple
outgoing edges to EdgeCOs that do not interconnect with AggCOs.
In general, we expect that edges between EdgeCOs typically result
from outdated rDNS, but when a CO appears to aggregate con-
nectivity for multiple COs that otherwise lack connectivity, we
conclude that the CO might function as a small AggCO. In total,
we removed 26.9% of the unique CO edges in Comcast and 10.6%
of the Charter CO edges. The higher fraction of removed Comcast
edges reflects prior experience with stale Comcast rDNS.
Next, we infer related AggCOs that connect to the same set
of EdgeCOs. Networks often connect an EdgeCO to two AggCOs
to increase resiliency to AggCO failure, and we expect that two
AggCOs that connect to the same EdgeCO typically connect to
the same set of EdgeCOs, since access networks use bundled fiber
rings to connect AggCOs to many EdgeCOs. We evaluate each
combination of AggCO pairs in the same region, concluding a
relationship between the two AggCOs 𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑥 and 𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑦 if at least
3/4 of the EdgeCOs connected to 𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑋 overlap with EdgeCOs
connected to 𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑌 , and the overlap accounts for at least half of
the EdgeCOs connected to 𝐴𝐺𝐺𝑌 . The overlap requirements help
ensure that we only pair AggCOs with substantial downstream
EdgeCO overlap. We also pair two AggCOs if one AggCO has 3/4
overlap with the other AggCO, and neither AggCO would otherwise
have a relationship. To reflect the fact that EdgeCOs connect with
fiber rings, we add edges to ensure that that all related AggCOs
connect to the same EdgeCOs in the regional network graphs. This
added 7.8% new edges to Comcast, and 6.1% new edges to Charter.
B.4 Redundant AggCO Connections
We inferred that 11.4% and 37.7% of the EdgeCOs in Comcast and
Charter connected to a one other CO, respectively, but we never ob-
served any CO-level redundancy for the Charter regional network
in the southeastern US. This region is the only large regional net-
work in Comcast or Charter where we did not observe any CO-level
redundancy, suggesting we inferred an incomplete CO topology for
the region. Excluding the southeast, 29.0% of the Charter EdgeCOs
connect to a single upstream CO. Furthermore, of the EdgeCOs
connected to one other CO, 33.7% of the Comcast COs and 42.2%
of the Charter COs connect to another EdgeCO (not AggCO). Con-
sidering only the EdgeCOs connected to an AggCO, and excluding
the Charter southeast region, 10.5% of the Comcast EdgeCOs and
18.4% of the Charter EdgeCOs connect to a single AggCO.
C DETAILS ABOUT AT&T MAPPING
AT&T’s regional network routers do not use rDNS names, so we
cannot extend the DNS-based geolocation method (§5) to cluster
AT&T’s IP addresses into physical facilities. Additional visibility
challenges arise from operational practices such as MPLS tunneling
and ICMP filtering, which can both hide physical router topology
from external traceroutes. These challenges make it critical to have
a sufficiently large and strategically selected set of targets.
Target selection. To find responsive destinations with known ge-
ographic locations, we extracted location hints from rDNS names of
the IP-DSLAMs connected to end-user modems (denoted as lspgw).
From our pilot tests using Ark and RIPE Atlas, we found that AT&T
encoded the rDNS names of lspgws with the regular expression
([\d-]+-1).lightspeed.([a-z]{6}).sbcglobal.net, where the first part of
the name is the dashed decimal notation of the corresponding IP
address and the second part is a CLLI code-like 6-character string
that represents the city and the state. For example, sndgca and
nsvltn denoted San Diego, CA, and Nashville, TN, respectively.
