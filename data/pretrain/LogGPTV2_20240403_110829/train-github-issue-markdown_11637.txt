### Apache Airflow version
2.3.3
### What happened
I have multiple dags running regularly. Dags fail randomly for no reason. When
I look at the grid view, one task is in skipped state due to dag timeout. But
that task did not get executed during the entire period until timeout.
This happens randomly to any dag, to any task, at any time.
