may be buﬀered in the source cell if the device is receiving data. Depending on
how such data is handled, intra-LTE handovers can be categorized as seamless,
which discards all data in the PDCP retransmission queue in the source cell,
or lossless which forwards such data to the target cell. Recent work [17] shows
that seamless handover is better in terms of goodput while lossless handover is
better in terms of latency. We ﬁnd that all cells in Sprint network use lossless
handover, as no packet loss is found after the handover.
In AT&T network, we found three cells drop packets when there are han-
dovers between them. In order to understand the underlying cause of this phe-
nomena, we carry a Nexus 5 device that keeps downloading data from a local
server while moving in the coverage area of these three cells. Server throughput
is throttled at diﬀerent values using the tc tool. All tcpdump traces from both
the server and the client are captured.
Figure 8 shows bytes in ﬂight right before the handover and the corresponding
number of lost packets during the handover. We ﬁnd that the number of lost
packets has a strong correlation with the number of bytes in ﬂight. We infer
that there is a buﬀer in the cell that buﬀers packets during the data transmission
between the server and the device. When a handover happens between the source
cell and the target cell, the source cell tries to forward packets in the buﬀer to the
target cell. However, during handover, the device cannot receive packets from
the source cell in time, thus the number of accumulated packets at the cell may
exceed the buﬀer size. In that case, the source cell has to drop packets during
the handover.

We infer the cause of this unusual behavior of these three cells during han-
dover is the poor conﬁguration of their buﬀer size. From the experiment results,
the buﬀer size of these cells is between 250 KB to 400 KB. For normal TCP con-
nections, the small buﬀer size does not cause packet loss due to the ﬂow control
in TCP. However, during handover, the small buﬀer size can easily lead packets
loss, further degrading the performance of handover. In the worst case of our
experiment, the duration of retransmission for the lost packets is 2.27 s, which
can greatly degrade user experiences.
5.2 Performance Change After Handover
One desirable goal of handover is to improve performance after switching to
a new cell. We analyze the data to compare performance before and after the
handover.
We ﬁlter out the throughput measurements that include handovers and cal-
culate the average throughput value in the 5 s before the handover occurs and
the average value in the 5 s after the handover. As shown in Fig. 9, we ﬁnd that
the throughput does not improve consistently after the handover. In 43% of
cases, the throughput decreases after the handover. Similar to throughput, nei-
ther latency (Fig. 10) nor jitter improves consistently based on the ping and UDP

burst measurements. The median improvement is close to 0 for all these metrics.
The current handover algorithms do not appear to optimize performance.
As mentioned in Sect. 4, the currently deployed handover decisions of all the
carriers use signal strength as one of the key metrics and focus on improving
signal strength after the handover. However, signal strength is an imperfect
metric for performance, as performance also depends on other factors such as
allocated PRBs determined by the cell load [6]. We calculate the throughput
values each second using the crowd-sourced data and associate them with the
RSRP and obtained PRB ratio. As shown in Fig. 12, the achieved throughput is
determined by the PRB ratio as well.
Figure 11 shows an example where signal strength increases after the han-
dover, but the performance degrades. To conﬁrm the root cause of such perfor-
mance degradation, we look into the change in allocated PRBs after handover
for the cases where throughput decreases. As shown in Fig. 13, in most of such
cases the allocated PRBs of the UE decreases after the handover, indicating that
the target cell has a higher load.
Instead of making handover decisions simply based on signal strength, we
propose that each cell maintains a 2-dimensional performance map from signal
strength value ranges and load value ranges to performance ranges including
throughput, loss rate, and delay. The performance values are updated by pas-
sively monitoring ongoing traﬃc at the cell. The cells exchange the performance
information of the UE and UE’s perceived signal strength of the potential target
cell with its neighbors and trigger handover only if there is signiﬁcantly enough
performance improvements. The type of performance metric to be considered
depends on user traﬃc demand inferred from its traﬃc types.
6 Conclusion
Handovers are essential for maintaining connectivity as users move with their
devices. With the introduction of small cells in the incoming 5G network, han-
dovers will become more frequent and critical. In this paper, we conduct the ﬁrst
comprehensive empirical study to investigate the decision strategies of intra-LTE
handover in the wild and analyze their impact on performance. Our study exam-
ines currently deployed decision policies by carriers and sheds light on opportu-
nities for improving the handover decision process with respect to application
performance.

S. Xu et al.
Our analysis shows that the policies enforced by carriers are not optimized
in terms of performance. The key factor to decide handover is signal strength,
and the handover trigger thresholds are found to be statically conﬁgured. We
discover that the performance can degrade after the handover. We propose that
the handover decision should depend on performance information predicted using
both signal strength and cell load information.
