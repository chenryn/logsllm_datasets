HAM FOR HACKERS
TAKE BACK THE AIRWAVES
JonM – DEFCON 16
JonM
 Licensed Amateur Extra—the highest class of license 
in the US
 Operating since 2000
 Radio is just one of my hobbies…software security 
consulting is the most lucrative
You want to play with wireless…
 Remote control
 Data links
 Personal communication
 Telemetry
So what are your options?
US Frequency Allocation
None if it is free for general use
Listening is unrestricted
Aside from some asinine restrictions on analog cell 
phone frequencies, you can listen to whatever you like 
all day long. 
So what can you use?
 FCC Part 95: Personal Radio Services
 CB and FRS
 Low power, short range (couple of miles), voice only
 Small number of channels
 FCC Part 15: Unlicensed RF Devices
 WiFi, garage door openers, cordless phones, etc
 Limited power
 Antenna restrictions
 A number of frequencies available, but lots of users
Long story short
 Unlicensed operations are restricted
 You’re not going to get much range
 You’re going to have a lot of competition
 If there’s interference, you have to take it
 If you’re interfering with someone else, you have to 
shut down your transmitter
Enter amateur radio
 FCC Part 97: Amateur Radio Service
 Upsides: 
 You get to use a lot more power
 You have primary use on a number of bands
 Downsides: 
 You have to be licensed
 You have to follow operating procedures
Created for Hackers
The FCC’s stated principles for amateur radio include:
“Continuation and extension of the amateur's proven 
ability to contribute to the advancement of the radio 
art.”
Amateur radio was created to provide skilled 
individuals with a forum for experimentation and 
technical advancement.
Amateur Radio Limitations
 With great power comes great responsibility:
 You have to identify yourself
 No secrecy, no encryption
 You can’t broadcast, especially not music
 “Non-pecuniary”—non-commercial use only
Oh, one more thing…
You can’t swear.
Seriously.
Licensing
 Three levels of license: Technician, General, Extra
 If you just want to experiment, the Technician 
(lowest) license will get you plenty:
 Full privileges on the bands above 50 MHz
 1500 watts of power!
 Unlimited bandwidth above 902 MHz
 The higher classes give you access to the HF bands
 30 MHz and below
 Long range, even with low power
Testing
 Tests are multiple choice
 The entire question pool is published
 75% is a passing grade
 Technician exam is only 35 questions
 You don’t have to know Morse code
But isn’t ham for losers?
I know what you’re thinking:
Ham radio is full of old men who wear suspenders 
and sit around talking about what they’re going to 
buy when they go into the city.
Well…yes.
These
Folks
Exist
You don’t have to wear suspenders
As long as you’re following the rules and keep to 
yourself, they’ll leave you alone.
And besides, some of them are actually pretty damn 
smart.
And isn’t the technology outdated?
 Well, yes:
Handheld radio
Cell phone
FM modulation
High quality, efficient, codecs
Analog signaling
Digital signaling
Single frequency at a time
Frequency hopping, spread 
spectrum
Spectrum inefficient–One 
transmitter at a time
Multiplexing allows multiple 
transmitters access at once
But there’s lots of cool stuff
 Things I’ve done:
 Cross country contacts using amateur satellites
 Tracked a high altitude balloon on the edge of space
 Picked up signals from the east coast with $20 of 
hardware
 Added emergency location beaconing to my 
motorcycle
New Technologies
 Spread Spectrum
 Digital modes
 Software Defined Radio (SDR)
Spread Spectrum
 Instead of one fat signal, transmit using several 
smaller signals
 Less interference, more bandwidth, more reliable
 There was a peak of interest in the amateur radio 
community in the late ‘90s
 Since then, interest has waned
 All of the kits for SS are out of production
Digital modes
D-STAR is a new standard for digital communication
 Basically an ATM implementation
 Up to 128 kbps data rate, over long distances
 4800 bps digital voice
 Uses the proprietary AMBE codec (boo)
 A plethora of add-on data services
 Position reporting
 Image transfer
 Text messaging
 Only ICOM is making D-STAR radios right now
Software Defined Radio
 Instead of doing signal processing in hardware, do 
it in software
 Makes for a much more versatile radio
 New modulation schemes are just software patches
 You can implement powerful filtering and decoding 
algorithms, too
 Because software does the heavy lifting, hardware 
becomes much cheaper
GNU Radio
 Open source SDR project
 Uses the Universal Software Radio Peripheral
 Basically an FPGA, some high quality DACs and ADCs, 
and a daughterboard interface
 The daughterboards handle the RF detection and 
generation
 Daughterboards give coverage from 0-2.4 GHz
 Support for many different modulations, encodings, 
etc.
 At $700 for the base USRP, not inexpensive
USRP, expensive?
 $700, plus an extra $150 for RF modules, just for a 
radio?
 Yeah, but it gives you most of the functionality of 
this here $13,000 radio:
HP SDR
 Like the USRP, a modular SDR platform
 Stronger amateur radio focus than USRP, but 
hardware is designed to be modular and versatile
 Still in development, backplane and several boards 
available now
 Price for a full 0-55 MHz SDR transceiver should be 
in the $800 range
I/Q demodulation
 Ditch the FPGA, and use the analog hardware 
you’ve already got
 Use a cheap board to grab a chunk of spectrum, 
and feed it into your soundcard
 Software then performs demodulation and 
decoding
 Bandwidth is limited by your soundcard
 Frequency is limited by what you can generate 
cleanly
 50 MHz is the practical limit for low-cost hardware
SoftRock radios
 Low cost kits:
 $10 single band receiver
 $30 single band transceiver
 $42 frequency agile receiver
 A variety of software packages to process the 
signals
Go from this:
Tune across 
the band.
Find a signal.
Copy the 
morse code 
down to 
paper.
You do know 
morse, right?
To this:
Start the 
software.
See the morse 
scroll across 
the screen.
Scroll through 
the spectrum, 
and read the 
text.
Call to arms
 Hams are stuck using ancient technology
 But they're all dying off (literally)
 When they go away, so will their spectrum
 They’re not making good use of it anyways
 Let's keep that spectrum open for experimentation, 
and do cool things with it
We can make it better…
…just by using existing technologies we all know and 
love.
 More efficient spectrum use
 Higher data rates
 D-STAR is just TCP/IP reinvented, and is built 
around a restricted technology
 SDR opens a wealth of possibilities
What next?
 Get your license!
 Start experimenting
 Build some kits
 Play with software
 Repurpose existing hardware
 Bring amateur radio back into the realm of hackers 
and experimenters
