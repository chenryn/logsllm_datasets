Each element in the mapping list specifies the configuration for a particular column. These elements are defined by three key properties: `column`, `datatype`, and `properties`. For a more detailed explanation, please refer to the [data mappings overview](../kusto/management/mappings.md).

### Key Properties:
- **`column`**: Identifies the name of the column.
- **`datatype`**: Specifies the data type of the column.
- **`properties`**: Contains additional attributes or settings related to the column.

For further information and examples, see the [data mappings overview](../kusto/management/mappings.md).
