congestion loss rate. 2a compares the corruption loss rate
with congestion loss rate of a link for one week and shows
corruption has little variation than congestion. 2b plots the
CDF of the coefficient of variance of packet loss rate across
15 data centers for one week and shows corruption loss rate
has less variation compared to congestion loss rate.
percentage of links in the DCN have any corruption or congestion;
we exclude these percentages for confidentiality. We see that over
90% of links with congestion have a loss rate between 10−8 and 10−5.
As the loss rate increases, the percentage of links with congestion
in each category decreases. This is expected, as congestion control
reduces flows’ sending rate which lowers the loss rate. However,
the same trend does not hold for corruption: 12.67% of links ap-
pear in the last loss bucket with loss rate ≥ 10−3 (or 0.1%) whereas
congestion appears in 0.22% of links.
Corruption rate is stable over time. Figure 2a shows the corruption
and congestion loss rate of example links for one week. We can see
that the corruption rate has less variation compared to congestion
which varies by three orders of magnitude in a short amount of time.
A similar observation holds for the entire data set. We quantify
the level of variation of loss rate on a link using the coefficient of
variation (CV), which is standard deviation divided by the mean.
Figure 2b shows the CDF of CV between congestion and corrup-
tion loss rates for all links in one week. For 80% of the links, CV
for corrupting links is smaller than four while for congestion, it is
more than twice that amount. Thus, for most links, corruption loss
rate is more stable than congestion loss rate.
Corruption rate is uncorrelated with utilization. Inherently, cor-
ruption loss rate is stable over time because it does not vary with
link utilization. Figure 3a shows a scatter plot of utilization versus
loss rate of a link for one week. Congestion loss rate has a posi-
tive correlation with the outgoing traffic rate. Unlike congestion,
corruption loss rate does not change as the link’s incoming traf-
fic rate changes. To depict the lack of correlation in all links, we
compute the Pearson correlation between utilization of a link and
the logarithm of its loss rates. Figure 3b shows the CDF of Pearson
correlation across all links. The mean correlation between incoming
link utilization and corruption loss rate is only 0.19, and 85% of
the links have a correlation between -0.5 and +0.5. Hence, for most
links, there is no correlation between their utilization and corrup-
tion loss rate. In contrast, the mean correlation between outgoing
link utilization and corruption loss rate is 0.62, which indicates a

strong positive correlation. This behavior is expected because more
traffic leads to a higher congestion loss rate.
Because the corruption loss rate is uncorrelated with utilization,
application or transport layer reactions will not resolve it. Thus,
unlike congestion, packet corruption is a pernicious fault that is
is not mitigated when senders slowdown. Instead, it persists—to
stop it, we must disable the link and then have technicians fix it.
A related, unfortunate aspect of corruption losses is that they lead
loss-sensitive transport protocols such as TCP to unnecessarily
slow down, which does nothing to resolve corruption but does hurt
application performance.
Corruption has weak spatial locality. We investigated if corrupt-
ing links tend to be spatially correlated (e.g., on the same switch or
topologically close) or scattered across the DCN (uniformly and)
randomly, and we found weak spatial locality. To demonstrate this
finding, we first compute the fraction of switches in the DCN that
have at least one link with a high corruption loss rate, i.e., in the
set of the worst 10% of corrupting links. We then simulate a hypo-
thetical setting in which the same number of corrupting links are
randomly spread through the network, and again compute the frac-
tion of switches to which they belong. We then calculate the ratio
of the two switch fractions. For example, let’s say x% of switches
contain the worst 10% of corrupting links. If those corrupting links
are uniformly distributed, y% of switches will contain them. Then
the ratio is x
. If the ratio is 1, it suggests that corrupting links are
y
scattered randomly across the switches. Lower ratios indicate more
co-location with switches.
We repeat this analysis for 100 different values, between 0 and
100%, for the set of corrupting links chosen, and we also repeat
the analysis for congested links. As Figure 4 shows, for congestion,
the number of affected switch is only 20% of what the random
distribution suggests. This means congested links exhibit a high
degree of spatial locality. For corruption, this ratio is around 80%,
which indicates weak spatial locality. We can also see that when we

tion loss rate.
focus on the worst corrupting links (e.g., the top 10%), the locality
is weaker. Thus, the worst offenders are more likely to be randomly
spread in the network.
While we expected congestion to exhibit locality, the locality
(albeit weak) of corruption surprised us. As we show in §4, it occurs
because of shared root causes (e.g., bad switch backplane or poorly-
routed fiber bundle). We also found that spatially related links
start corrupting packets roughly the same time and have similar
corruption loss rates. We omit these results from the paper.
Corruption is asymmetric. Corruption in one direction of the link
does not imply corruption in the reverse direction. With a week’s
worth of data, we observed that only 8.2% of the links among links
with packet corruption had bidirectional corruption.3 For conges-
tion, 72.7% of links among links with congestion losses had bidi-
rectional losses. For those links with bidirectional losses, Figure 5
shows average packet loss rate on both directions of the link. For
congestion, however, we see a cluster of links for which the conges-
tion loss rates in both directions are similar and large. We speculate
that high, bidirectional congestion is caused by link failures that
temporarily reduce network capacity for both upstream and down-
stream traffic.
Corruption is uncorrelated with link location. Corruption happens
at every stage of the DCN topology. We computed the probability
that a link is corrupting for each stage of the network (e.g., ToR-to-
aggregation, aggregation-to-ToR, aggregation-to-spine), and we did
3This asymmetry implies that a more efficient way (in terms of network capacity)
to mitigate corruption would be to disable only one direction of the link, but since
current hardware and software does not allow unidirectional links, we disable both
directions in CorrOpt.

not observe any bias. This observation also implies that corruption
does not depend on cable length, since cable lengths at higher
stages tend to be longer, or the type of switch. In contrast, we find
that certain stages of the DCN have significantly fewer congestion
losses than the rest. We find this reduction in congestion losses to
be correlated with the use of deep buffer switches. Shallow buffer
switches in such stages still experience congestion losses.
4 ROOT CAUSES OF CORRUPTION
To successfully repair a corrupting link, operators need to address
the root cause of corruption. We analyzed over 300 trouble tickets
while monitoring all links’ optical receive power (RxPower) and
transmit power (TxPower), as well as their corruption statistics.4
This tandem monitoring of tickets and link statistics turns up a
set of symptoms that are the most common signature of each root
cause. In §5.2 we use these symptoms to recommend repair actions
to on-site technicians to help them eliminate corruption faster.
Root cause 1: Connector contamination. An optical link consists
of fiber optics cable and a transceiver on each end. Transceivers
convert the signal between electrical and optical domains, and
the fiber carries the optical signal. In fiber optics, the tolerance of
dirt or contamination on a connector is near zero [22]. Airborne
dirt particles may even scratch the connectors permanently if not
removed. Fiber tips or connectors can become contaminated during
installation or maintenance. Patch panels can become contaminated
if they are left open to the air or scrape off foreign particles under
repeated usage. Figure 6a shows an MTP fiber connection with 12
fiber cores. Prior to installation, technicians should inspect each
fiber core manually using a fiber microscope. Figure 6b shows a
magnified image of two cores we inspected using a P5000i Fiber
Microscope [21]. In this case, the device found more than five defects
larger than 2 µm in diameter on the right-hand side fiber core and
failed the test on it. Common types of contamination and defects
include dirt, oil, pits, chips, and scratches [13]. Fiber cleaning can
remove dirt and contamination on the connector.
Contamination reduces RxPower which increases the probability
of packet corruption by making it more likely that the transceiver is
unable to decode the signal correctly [38]. Since fiber optics cables
and connectors are unidirectional, we find that the most probable
indicator of contamination is high TxPower on both sides of the
link, with low RxPower along only one direction of the link (i.e.,
the receiving side of corruption). As Figure 7 shows, the packet
corruption of a link jumps at the same time as its RxPower drops,
but the TxPower on the opposite side remains stable. In this case,
cleaning the both sides of the link mitigates the corruption.
Not all forms of contamination cause low RxPower; some cause
backs reflections, where the RxPower remains high but the reflec-
tions interfere with signal decoding. Transceivers do not report
on reflections, and thus we are not able to correctly identify this
root cause all the time. Such limitations of accurate identification
exist for other root causes as well, which is why the accuracy of
our repair recommendations is not 100%.
Root cause 2: Damaged or bent fiber. Cable management is a
tedious task in large fiber plants. A bent or damaged fiber causes

Figure 6: Dirty connection creates corruption. 6a shows an
MTP fiber connection consisting of 12 fiber cores. 6b shows
a magnified image of two cores. These images were taken
using a P5000i Fiber Microscope to inspect and certify fiber
end face quality in production data centers [21]. In this
case, the tool found more than five defects larger than 2 µm
in diameter on the right-hand side fiber core. Technicians
are supposed to inspect each fiber core manually prior to
installation–a task that is largely ignored because it is man-
ual and cumbersome. Similar observations are reported for
other fiber types [14].

(b) Corruption loss rate

corruption. RxPower suddenly drops on November 5, caus-
ing corruption loss to increase to 10−2 (1%). TxPower on the
transmit side shows no changes. Fiber cleaning takes place
on November 27 which restores RxPower level and elimi-
nates the corruption.
the optical signal to leak out of the fiber, reducing the signal strength
in the fiber. Cables should be laid such that they are not bent beyond
their specification, especially for fibers at the bottom layer of a fiber
housing mount. Figure 8 shows a case in our data center; the fibers
at the bottom row are too bent, causing corruption.
When we study the RxPower of damaged or bent cables, we
find both sides of the link are likely to have low RxPower coupled
with high TxPower. Figure 9 shows an example of a damaged fiber
causing packet corruption. Another indicator of cable damage is
that switches on both sides experience packet corruption, which is
otherwise rare (§3).
Root cause 3: Decaying transmitters. Transceivers are built using
semiconductor laser technology, and their lasers tend to have a

Table 2: Summary of root causes of corruption, their symp-
toms and their relative contribution in our data centers.
Root cause 5: Shared-component failure. Some infrastructure com-
ponents in a DCN, such as breakout cables5 and switches, are shared
by multiple links. A faulty breakout cable causes four links on the
same switch to have packet corruption at the same time. Breakout
cable replacement can resolve the issue. Faults in the switch back-
plane can also cause multiple links to experience corruption. In
such cases, several links on the shared infrastructure suffer packet
corruption, despite good optical power levels on all of them. In
addition, the corruption loss rate on these links is similar. When
switches have unused ports that are not affected by the failure,
rewiring can resolve the issue. Otherwise, the switch has to be
replaced. This root cause is primarily responsible for the spatial
locality of packet corruption (§3). We find in our data that links
experiencing packet corruption because of other root causes, which
usually accompany low RxPower, exhibit no locality.
Table 2 summarizes the root causes mentioned above, their symp-
toms and their relative contribution in our data centers. We use the
notation of T xPower → RxPower to indicate the power levels of
each side of optical links. H and L indicate if the power level is above
or below the acceptable threshold (determined by the transceiver
technology and loss budget of links). The percentage of contribu-
tion of each root cause is presented as a range because our ticket
diaries show that technicians often take multiple actions (e.g., clear
the connectors and reseat the transceiver) without logging which
action resulted in the repair. When a root cause is present in such
a bundle, we assume that it was not the culprit to compute the low
end of the reported range and we assume that it was the culprit to
