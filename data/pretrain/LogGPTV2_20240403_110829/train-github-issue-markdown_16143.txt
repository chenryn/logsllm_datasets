#### Issue Description
I think the "Escape Sequences in Strings" lesson has a bug.
I am going through the Javascript course on FreeCodeCamp.com and am stuck at
this challenge, 'Escape Sequences in Strings':
    Assign the following three lines of text into the single variable myStr using escape sequences.
    FirstLine
    \SecondLine\
    ThirdLine
    You will need to use escape sequences to insert special characters correctly. You will also need to follow the spacing as it looks above, with no spaces between escape sequences or words.
    Here is the text with the escape sequences written out.
    "FirstLine newline backslash SecondLine backslash carriage-return ThirdLine"
Here is how I'm writing the code example:
`js var myStr = "Firstline\n\\Secondline\\\rThirdline"; `
In the lesson, the check requires there to be only one ` \n`. The `\r` doesn't
seem to function properly. I have tried different work arounds and searching
hasn't provided any direction. I have tried using 'console' in the developer
window of the browser and it appears `\n` is working but the `\r` is not.
According to the rules of the instruction,
`js var myStr = "Fristline\n\\Secondline\\\r\nThirdline"; `
is not valid by the lesson standards.
Is the carriage-return not working?  
Am I misunderstanding the lesson?
According to the book 'Javascript Bible' by Danny Goodman, chapter 15 'The
String Objects', section 'Special Inline Characters' states:
"In most cases, browsers ignore carriage returns or render them like spaces."

To highlight this issue I put similar isolating code found in the lesson
inside `console.log();` in the Developer window of the browser. I received
some interesting results.
This is what occurs in the browser as displayed in console:
`js console.log("escape characters use a \\\nbackslash. But a carrige-return
\rdoes this!"); `
escape characters use a \  
backslash. But a carrige-return does this!
This is the same code copied to clipboard from the browsers console display
and pasted into an editor:
`js console.log("escape characters use a \\\nbackslash. But a carrige-return
\rdoes this!"); `  
escape characters use a \  
backslash. But a carrige-return  
does this!
Browser display:
`js var myStr = "Firstline\n\\Secondline\\\rThirdline"; console.log(myStr); `  
Firstline  
\Secondline\Thirdline
Clipboard paste result:
`js var myStr = "Firstline\n\\Secondline\\\rThirdline"; console.log(myStr); `  
Firstline  
\Secondline\  
Thirdline
