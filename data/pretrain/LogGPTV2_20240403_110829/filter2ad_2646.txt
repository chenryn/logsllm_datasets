## 1. Introduction

The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to become a first-class citizen of the future internet. The number of IoT devices is expected to surpass traditional devices like smartphones, tablets, and PCs. However, several challenges need to be addressed for the widespread deployment of IoT devices.

### 1.1 Vision: Ubiquitous Deployment of IoT Devices

To achieve ubiquitous deployment, we must overcome two primary limiting factors:

#### 1.2 Limiting Factor One: Battery Energy Density

Battery energy density has only improved by a factor of three over the past 22 years, from 1990 to 2012. This slow improvement hinders the long-term operation of IoT devices.

#### 1.3 Limiting Factor Two: Wireless Radio Power Consumption

Wireless communication consumes significantly more power compared to computation, storage, and sensing. For example, wireless radios consume orders of magnitude more power than components like accelerometers, microcontrollers, and SRAM.

## 2. Challenges in IoT Communication

### 2.1 How Should We Communicate with IoT Devices?

To address the power consumption challenge, we propose leveraging reflected wireless signals, which do not consume power. Can we embed information in these reflected signals?

### 2.2 Insight: Leveraging Reflected Wireless Signals

By using reflected signals, we can enable ultra-low-power communication. This method, known as backscatter, involves a backscatter reader and a backscatter device. The backscatter device reflects the carrier wave, and the backscatter reader decodes the information.

### 2.3 Backscatter: An Ultra-Low-Power Communication Primitive

Backscatter communication involves:
- **Backscatter Reader:** Transmits a carrier wave and receives the reflected signal.
- **Backscatter Device:** Reflects the carrier wave, embedding information in the reflection.

## 3. Challenges in Using Backscatter for IoT Devices

### 3.1 Lack of Reader Infrastructure

One major challenge is the lack of dedicated backscatter reader infrastructure. To overcome this, we explore the possibility of using existing WiFi signals for backscatter communication.

### 3.2 Leveraging WiFi Signals for Backscatter

Can we embed backscatter bits on existing WiFi traffic? This would allow us to use commodity WiFi radios for backscatter communication, eliminating the need for specialized readers.

## 4. HitchHike: Embedding Backscatter Bits on 802.11b WiFi

### 4.1 Overview

HitchHike is a system that enables backscatter communication using 802.11b WiFi packets. It allows IoT devices to communicate with close to zero power consumption.

### 4.2 802.11b WiFi Primer

802.11b is a WiFi protocol that supports 11 Mbps transmission at 2.4 GHz. Most modern devices support 802.11b. The protocol uses a finite set of codewords to encode data.

### 4.3 Key Technique: Codeword Translation

A tag can translate a codeword from the transmitter into another codeword within the same codebook. For example, a tag can translate code 0 to code 1 and vice versa by multiplying the signal by -1.

### 4.4 Decoding Tag Data

Tag data can be decoded by performing an XOR operation with the data transmitted by the 802.11b transmitter.

## 5. Dealing with Self-Interference

### 5.1 Self-Interference from WiFi

The primary WiFi signal is much louder than the backscattered signal, making it difficult to detect the backscattered signal. To address this, we shift the frequency of the backscattered signal away from the primary WiFi signal.

### 5.2 Achieving Frequency Shift

We multiply the primary WiFi signal with a square wave during backscatter, shifting the frequency of the backscattered signal.

### 5.3 Eliminating Double Side-Band Backscatter

To eliminate one side of the backscatter, we use a signal with a reversed polarity on one side.

## 6. System Deployment and Performance

### 6.1 XoRFi System Deployment

XoRFi, our system, was deployed in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. The performance was evaluated in terms of throughput and distance.

### 6.2 Performance Evaluation

- **Line-of-Sight Deployment:** High throughput up to 16 meters.
- **Non-Line-of-Sight Deployment:** Good performance up to 52 meters.

## 7. Conclusion

Wireless research is about innovation and fun. XoRFi is a novel backscatter communication system that can be built using off-the-shelf components. It enables communication with commodity WiFi radios with close to zero power consumption.
