802.11b WiFi uses a ﬁnite set of codewords to encode 
data 0 and data 1.
Key technique — codeword translation

A tag can translate a codeword from transmitter into another 
codeword within the same codebook.

What does * -1 mean for a wireless signal?

s(t)*-1
How should we interpret -1?
S(t) is inverted
500uW power for a 
phase shifter
S(t) is delayed
1uW for a 5ns delay

Why the process of translating codewords is XOR?
code i
tag data
code j
tag data 0: code j = code i 
tag data 1: code j = code i * -1
code j = tag data XOR code i
 22
How to decode the tag data?
code i
tag data
code j
code j XOR code i = tag data XOR code i XOR code i 
                              =  tag data
Tag data decoding can be done by performing XOR with the 
data transmitted by the 802.11b transmitter.
 23
Are we done? Not yet…

We cannot hear the backscattered signal…
We cannot hear the backscattered signal because the 
primary 802.11b WiFi signal is much louder!
 25
Why the primary WiFi signal is much louder?
Power
WiFi signal
backscatter
Because the primary WiFi signal and the backscattered 
signal share the same spectrum.
