User: Working on different projects I have the choice of selecting different programming languages, as long as the task is done.
I was wondering what the real difference is, in terms of performance, between writing a program in Python, versus doing it in C.
The tasks to be done are pretty varied, e.g. sorting textfiles, disk access, network access, textfile parsing.
Is there really a noticeable difference between sorting a textfile using the same algorithm in C versus Python, for example?
And in your experience, given the power of current CPU's (i7), is it really a noticeable difference (Consider that its a program that doesnt bring the system to its knees).
Assistant: If your text files that you are sorting and parsing are large, use C. If they aren't, it doesn't matter. You can write poor code in any language though. I have seen simple code in C for calculating areas of triangles run 10x slower than other C code, because of poor memory management, use of structures, pointers, etc. 
Your I/O algorithm should be independent of your compute algorithm. If this is the case, then using C for the compute algorithm can be much faster.
