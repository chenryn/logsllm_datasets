## Problem Description
https://github.com/ffxsam/autocomplete-bug
There are multiple issues:
  1. `openOnFocus` does not work (clicking in the field has no effect)
  2. When typing 'a' and clicking on an item that is outside the dialog, the event bubbles up and causes the dialog to close
Repo install instructions: (or just copy into a webpack boilerplate)
  1. `npm install`
  2. Install Meteor if not already installed (`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`).
  3. `meteor`
