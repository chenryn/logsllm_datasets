do willingly avoided updating their SDKs. If the ﬁrst is true, then Android is
being very conservative with their approach regarding alarms batching behav-
ior, which has a big impact on the power consumption of devices. Although we
did not study apps update rates, it would have been interesting to determine
if the second case holds by, for example, determining how many of these apps
were updated after the release of Android API level 19. Our intuition is that
even regularly updated apps often do not update their SDK. As an example, in
Table 3, we show a few well known apps which, by the time of our study, had
target SDKs lower than 19. Which means that these apps are unable to utilize
the new energy eﬃcient alarm APIs provided by the latest Android SDKs.
Even if the device is supported and up-to-date, apps can target old versions of
the Android SDKs, which can have a negative impact on the overall performance
of the device. Our results clearly demonstrate that there is slow adoption of new
SDK versions by application developers. More importantly, we see that despite
the eﬀorts to make Android more energy eﬃcient with respect to alarm handling
(e.g., through JobInfo and the introduction of inexact alarms), backwards com-
patibility (a necessary evil at this point due to fragmentation), lack of developer
awareness about new SDK beneﬁts, and misuse of alarms by developers makes
it hard to succeed.
3.4 Type of Alarms Depending on App Category
Considering the conservative behavior of Android regarding non-deferrable
alarms, we now wonder which type of apps require exact alarms. To this end, we
explore how diﬀerent categories (as retrieved from Google Play) of apps make
use of alarms (Fig. 2).
Surprisingly, categories of apps such as widgets (80 %), wallpapers (63 %)
and personalization (60 %) have a bigger fraction of apps with alarms than
communication (59 %) and social categories (55 %). While having more alarm
deﬁnitions does not necessarily mean that there will be more alarm occurrences
during runtime, we found that, for example, there are 308 widget apps deﬁning
repeating alarms (setRepeating and setInexactRepeating) (in Sect. 3.6 we

manually analyze some of these apps). Regarding time critical alarms, the ﬁve
application categories with most apps with exact alarms are respectively: casino
games (37.9 %), weather (35 %), family games (32.5 %), communication (32.1 %)
and role-playing games (31.8 %). Finally, the average number of alarms deﬁned
by apps per category is shown in Fig. 3.
The widgets category not only has the largest number of apps with alarms
and one of the highest time critical alarms usage (30.3 %), but also it also has the
highest average number of alarms (4.9) deﬁned within an application. The ana-
lyzed apps had up to 70 alarm deﬁnitions4, e.g., Whatsapp deﬁnes 28 alarms,
Instagram 11 and Facebook only 2. Again, we point that although Facebook
has only 2 alarm deﬁnitions, its alarms are actually very frequent during run-
time (Sect. 3.6).
