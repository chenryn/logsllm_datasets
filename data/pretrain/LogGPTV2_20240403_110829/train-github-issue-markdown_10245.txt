I'm getting an exception whilst using Browser-Kit whereby, if the response
returns a `Set-Cookie` expiration time that's in the past, it throws the an
exception like the following:
    Fatal error: Uncaught UnexpectedValueException: The cookie expiration time "-39600" is not valid.
An example of an HTTP header in my response:
    Set-Cookie	ADRUM_BTs=R:54|s:p; expires=Wed, 31-Dec-1969 13:00:00 GMT; path=/; HttpOnly
According to RFC 6265:
`Finally, to remove a cookie, the server returns a Set-Cookie header with an
expiration date in the past.`
So therefore, having a date in the past is expected behaviour and should
result in the cookie being deleted from the cookie jar, I'm assuming.
