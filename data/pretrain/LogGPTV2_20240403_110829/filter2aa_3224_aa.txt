>>> Goals
[4/42]
* Identify vulnerabilities in BLE smart locks
* Release proof of concept exploits
* Put pressure on vendors to improve security
* Raise consumer awareness
>>> What is Bluetooth Low Energy?
[5/42]
* Designed for apps that
don’t need to exchange
large amounts of data
* Minimal power
consumption
* Operates at 2.4 GHz
(same as Bluetooth
Classic)
* Short range (>> What is Bluetooth Low Energy?
[6/42]
* GATT (Generic Attribute
Profile)
- Client sends
requests to GATT
server
- Server stores
attributes
>>> Why Should I Care?
[7/42]
* Widely used and gaining popularity
* Securing homes and valuables
* Current BLE "security" products:
- Deadbolts
- Bike locks
- Lockers
- Gun Cases
- Safes
- ATMs
- Airbnb
>>> Who is Using BLE?
[8/42]
>>> Bluetooth Hacking is Affordable
[9/42]
* Ubertooth One - $100
* Bluetooth Smart USB dongle - $15
* Raspberry Pi - $40
* High gain directional antenna - $50
>>> Ubertooth One
[10/42]
* Created by Michael Ossmann
* Open source Bluetooth tool
* First affordable Bluetooth monitoring and
development platform
* Promiscuous sniffing
* BLE receive only capability (with current firmware)
>>> Wardriving
[11/42]
* Ubertooth + high gain
directional antenna
* Bluetooth dongle
* Easy deployment
* Long range (1/4+ mile)
* Concealable
* Warflying with drones...

>>> Uncracked Locks
[13/42]
* Noke Padlock
* Masterlock Padlock
* August Doorlock - hard-coded key
* Kwikset Kevo Doorlock
Discovered by Paul Lariviere & Stephen Hall
>>> Uncracked Locks
[13/42]
* Noke Padlock
* Masterlock Padlock
* August Doorlock
* Kwikset Kevo Doorlock - fragile
>>> Features of "Uncrackable" Locks
[14/42]
* Proper AES Encryption
* Truly random nonce (8-16 bytes)
* 2-factor authentication
* No hard-coded passwords
* Long passwords allowed
- 16-20 characters
>>> Vulnerable Devices
[15/42]
* Plain Text Password
- Quicklock Doorlock & Padlock v1.5
- iBluLock Padlock v1.9
- Plantraco Phantomlock v1.6
* Replay Attack
- Ceomate Bluetooth Smart Doorlock v2.0.1
- Elecycle EL797 & EL797G Smart Padlock v1.8
- Vians Bluetooth Smart Doorlock v1.1.1
- Lagute Sciener Smart Doorlock v3.3.0
>>> Vulnerable Devices
[16/42]
* Fuzzing
- Okidokey Smart Doorlock v2.4
* Decompiliing APKs
- Poly-Control Danalock Doorlock v3.0.8
* Device Spoofing
- Mesh Motion Bitlock Padlock v1.4.9
>>> Connection Sniffing
[17/42]
* Ubertooth used for sniffing
* Must be listening on an
advertisement channel (37,
38, 39) and follow a
connection
- Use 3 Ubertooths
(Uberteeth?), 1 on each
advertisement channel
* Passively listen to
conversation between the
App and Lock
User
Device
>>> Python Implementation
[18/42]
* Communicates directly to
the HCI
* Allows implementation of
additional commands and
functions
- 20+ commands thus
far
* Spoofing (BD Addr and
Host Name)
* Role reversal
* Connection oriented
channels
* ...and more!
