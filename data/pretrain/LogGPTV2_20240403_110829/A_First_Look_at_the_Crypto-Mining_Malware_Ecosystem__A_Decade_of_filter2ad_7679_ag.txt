A. Ethical issues
APPENDIX
Most of the data collected is publicly available. However,
both Palo Alto and Virus Total shared some non-public infor-
mation with us and we requested their permission to use it for
this paper. Another ethical concern relates to the implications
of reporting any misuse activity to the pools. In particular,
we have reported evidence of wallets seen in crypto-mining
malware. Our actions might produce an intervention over the
reported users due to criminal activity. This entails potential
ethical implications when non-criminal wallets are mistakenly
banned. We have taken due precautions to guarantee that we
only report wallets of samples used by malware as discussed
in the paper. Thus, our study has been approved by the
designated ethics ofﬁcer at the Reseach Ethics Board (REB)
of our institution.
In addition to our precautions, we have provided the pools
with accompanying evidences proving illicit activity, including
a pointer to the Virus Total report. However, despite our
involvement, the ﬁnal decision of banning the wallets relies
on the pool operators. These operators have additional insights
about the modus operandi of their users (e.g., the number of IP
addresses that are currently mining with a wallet) that can be
used to further corroborate any type of misuse. In fact, it is our
understanding that the pools that took actions against some of
the reported users based their decision solely on the number
of connections per wallet. Multiple connections from the same
wallet evidences the use of a botnet, which it is against the
terms and conditions of some of the pools. However, we note
that a botnet can always hide behind a single IP addressed
using proxies. Also, we have observed that the pools do not
proactively ban wallets that display botnet-like activity. We
discuss the ethical implications of the banning policies of the
pools in §VI.
B. Crypto-mining Trends in Underground Forums
As discussed in §II, the underground economy plays a key
role in the proliferation of the malicious crypto-mining threat.
After analyzing our dataset of posts collected from several
underground forums, we observe a large number of posts
discussing the use of illicit crypto-malware mining. Figure 1
shows the proportion of threats discussing the use of crypto-
malware mining across time for different cryptocurrencies.
We observe that Monero is the most prevalent cryptocurrency
in 2018. We also observe that while Bitcoin was the most
popular cryptocurrency among illicit miners, its popularity
has dropped over time. We also note that
the actors of
the underground economy have experimented with other less
popular cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin or Litecoin during
the 2013 and 2014. However, criminals shifted to Bitcoin
and Monero probably when they realized that their value was
becoming more proﬁtable.
We have studied a large portion of these posts as discussed
in §II. We showed that cybercrime commoditization is key to
the wealth of illicit crypto-mining. Figure 2 provides evidence
of this. In particular, it shows an advertisement posted in one
of the largest English-speaking underground forums, offering a
“Silent XMR” (i.e. using obfuscated binaries) Botnet. Among
others, one of the characteristics claimed is the use of xmrig
as a mining tool with support for proxies. We have seen a
wide range of similar adverts in our analysis of underground
economies.
C. Other Sources
Although our data collection originated from all the data
sources described in §III-A, we later discovered overlaps
between the different sources. During our dataset consoli-
dation, we observed that Virus Total, Palo Alto Networks,
Virus Share, and Hybrid Analysis together accounted for (at
least) all the samples observed in the remaining sources. We
also observed that most of the malicious miners appear in
these four datasets. For this, we consider them to be the
main sources for collecting binaries. For simplicity, we only
refer to Virus Total, Palo Alto Networks, Virus
Share, and Hybrid Analysis when labeling the source
of the dataset in this paper. However, we highlight that the
alternative sources of data provide valuable complementary
metadata that is used in our study. We also extend the metadata
available for each sample with targeted queries ran using
binary or network inspection as described in §III-C.
D. Additional Measurements
In this Section we provide additional measurements ob-
tained from our analysis:
• Table XIII shows an extension of the URLS hosting the
malware observed during our analysis.
• Table XIV shows the top 10 wallets sorted by how much
they gained. Note that these numbers include donation
wallets, which we have ﬁltered for our proﬁt analysis.
Nevertheless, we include them in Table XIV to show the
similarity between the ﬁndings reported in [16].
• Table XV shows the number of emails detected for each
associated domain. As it can be observed, most of the
emails are used to mine in minergate. This is an opaque
pool which allows mining in various cryptocurrencies.
E. Payments in the Freebuf Campaign
In this section, we visualize the payments done as a mining
reward for wallets belonging to the Freebuf campaign, which
is the longest campaign and the one with the highest earnings.
Concretely, Figure 7 shows the payments made to all the
wallets related to the campaign across time. A more detailed
analysis is shown in Figure 8, focusing on the payments done
in 2018 to the two wallets that were banned in minexmr. It
can be observed that, after being banned, campaign operators

decided to return to the ppxmr pool. However, while the
campaign is still active, both the intervention (i.e., wallets
being banned) and the change in the PoW of October 2018
has considerably reduced the payments made to this campaign,
nearly turning it off.
