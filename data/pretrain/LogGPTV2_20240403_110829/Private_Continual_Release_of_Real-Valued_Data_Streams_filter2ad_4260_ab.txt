random variable with CDF H(·; γ). Let xp be the p-quantile of
F . Let γ = − ln p
, so that the p-quantile of H, i.e., yp, is equal
to xp. We say that X has a light-tailed distribution beyond
xp, or equivalently F is light-tailed beyond xp, if ∀x ≥ xp,
F (x) ≥ H(x; γ).

The choice γ = − ln p

is immediate from Eq. 1.
Proposition 1. Let X be exponentially distributed with CDF
H(·; γ). Let r ≥ 1. Let xp be the p-quantile of H and let xpr
be the pr-quantile of H. Then
xp · r ≥ xpr .

Proof: When r = 1, we trivially have xpr = xp = xp · 1.
So, consider r > 1 and assume to the contrary that xp·r  τ then

IV. PRIVATELY ESTIMATING THE THRESHOLD τ
•
In this section, we will ﬁnd how to estimate and then
privately release the threshold τ. Ideally, τ should simulta-
neously minimize the time lag m and the outlier error αout
(characterized by the probability βout). We discarded several
straightforward ways of privately computing τ. For instance,
The most obvious choice is the maximum of the m
values. To make this differentially private, we need
to scale noise according to the sensitivity of the max
function. If we use global sensitivity, the estimated
threshold τ will be approximately B, resulting in no
utility gain. We could instead use smooth sensitiv-
ity [10], but since a possible neighbour of the target
stream σ may have any value between 0 and B, this
would again result in sensitivity close to B.
Another alternative is to use the standard deviation of
the underlying input distribution FB of σ. However,
this requires knowing the distribution in advance. We
are interested in a more general problem where only
a few simple assumptions about the distribution FB
hold true and are known beforehand.

Our statistic of choice is the p-quantile (cf. Deﬁnition 11).
This can be privately computed using an algorithm similar to
5
(Dollars)the algorithm for computing the median of a sequence using
smooth sensitivity [10]. Analogous to Deﬁnition 11, the p-
quantile of a stream σ →FB Σ of n elements is deﬁned as
{σ(i) : |{j  xp if λ  τmax. The ability to bound these three
error probabilities is important for our utility analysis. In the
following, we will formally introduce these sources of errors
and will subsequently try to minimise them for utility.

B. Error due to Underestimating the λp-Quantile
As mentioned above, since the expected value of ˆxp is xp,
we cannot bound Pr[ˆxp < xp] below and arbitrary bound βqt.
Thus, instead of estimating the p-quantile, we shall estimate
the λp-quantile with 1
pm < λ < 1. Now the probability of
having ˆxλp < xp is given by:
g(λ, p, m) = Pr[ˆxλp < xp]
λpm(cid:88)
= Pr[< λpm values of σ are ≥ xp]
