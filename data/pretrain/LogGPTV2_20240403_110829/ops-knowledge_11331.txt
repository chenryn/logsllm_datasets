User: I am looking for solutions to create a RPC client in Linux that can connect to Sun ONC RPC server.
The server is written in C.
I would like to know if I can:  

Create an RPC client in Linux  
Create the RPC client in Python
Assistant: An ONC RPC client can be created by using the .idl file and rpcgen. The original RPC protocol precedes SOAP by several years.
Yes, you can create the RPC client in linux (see rpcgen)
Yes, you can create the RPC client in python (please see pep-0384)
