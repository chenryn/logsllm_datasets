User: Please list common security issues when using Docker containers, and provide preventive measures.
Assistant: 1. Insecure images: Using unverified or unknown images can easily lead to security issues. The solution is to only use images from official or trusted sources, update images regularly, and use image signatures to ensure image integrity and security. 2. Exposed ports: The ports used by the container may be exploited by attackers. Countermeasures are to expose only necessary ports, restrict port access, and use firewall rules to restrict inbound and outbound traffic. 3. Improper container permissions: Improperly configured permissions for containers can lead to containers gaining unauthorized access or sharing sensitive information with the host at runtime. The solution is to confine containers to their dedicated users or groups and achieve stronger isolation by using a containerized OS. 4. Improper storage access: Data stored in containers may contain sensitive information. Preventative measures include using encrypted storage, regularly backing up and auditing storage contents, and using storage access control policies to restrict access to storage areas. 5. Security Vulnerabilities: Docker containers may be affected by operating system, kernel, or application vulnerabilities. Preventative measures include regularly updating and upgrading components, running vulnerability scans, and applying container security policies to restrict containers from accessing restricted resources. 6. Private image security: When building and deploying their own Docker images, developers should pay attention to build security and manage software, dependencies, and configurations separately to reduce security risks. Also, using the same source as the official mirror (such as Alpine) increases the security of the mirror. 7. Containerized operation and maintenance: There may be vulnerabilities in containerized operation and maintenance, such as the misconfiguration of the Docker API, allowing attackers to remotely access the server. Prevention measures include configuring and using administrative-only accounts and using logging and auditing tools to monitor access.
