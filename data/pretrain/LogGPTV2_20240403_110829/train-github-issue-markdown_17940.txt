Given the use case of dynamically instantiating content children using the
NgFor of NgIf directives I've found this not working in alpha.52. I thought
this was working before in alpha.44 but after testing it seems this was never
working.
I'd expect this to work and I thought this was the reason for content children
being represented with a `QueryList` in the first place.
    import {Component, Input, NgFor, NgIf} from 'angular2/angular2';
    @Component({
      selector: 'child'
      template: `
        {{text}}
      `
    })
    export class Child {
      @Input() text;
    }
    @Component({
      selector: 'parent'
      template: `
          Content children:
      `
    })
    export class Parent {}
    @Component({
      selector: 'app'
      template: `
          Outside of parent
      `,
      directives: [Parent, Child, NgFor, NgIf]
    })
    export class App {
      text = ['Child 1', 'Child 2', 'Child 3']
    }
