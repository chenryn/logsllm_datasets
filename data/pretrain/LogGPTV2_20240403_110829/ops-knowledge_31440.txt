Question: "Why is it necessary for ConfirmationUI to work in conjunction with Keymaster when generating confirmation tokens in the Android Protected Confirmation process?"
 "A": "Because ConfirmationUI alone cannot guarantee the cryptographic security of the confirmation tokens without the hardware-backed security provided by Keymaster."
 "B": "Because ConfirmationUI is responsible for the user interface, while Keymaster is only used to store and manage encryption keys unrelated to confirmation tokens."
 "C": "Because Keymaster generates the messages for user confirmation, while ConfirmationUI only displays them without creating any cryptographic statements."
 "D": "Because ConfirmationUI and Keymaster are redundant systems, and only one of them is actually necessary for the generation of confirmation tokens."
Answer: A
