User: I am going to seploy my first Django application to a cloud server like Amazon EC2 and the system is Linux Ubuntu.
But I cannot find a very good step-by-step tutorial for the deployment.
Could you recommend one?
And I also have the following questions:

What is the most recommended environment? Gunicorn, Apache+mod_python or ohters?
How to deploy my code? I am using mac and should I use ftp or check out from my github repository?

Thank you!
Assistant: Here is my stack:
Nignx + gunicon, Supervisor
Deployment, 
If you are planing frequent releases you should be looking at something like Fabric. Even of not frequent Fabric is a very good tool to be aware of. 
People have preference in terms of stack, but this one has been working great for me.
