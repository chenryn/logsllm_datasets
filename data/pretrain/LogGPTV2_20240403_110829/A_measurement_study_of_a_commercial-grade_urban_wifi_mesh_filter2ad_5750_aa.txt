## Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive measurement study of a large-scale urban WiFi mesh network consisting of over 250 Mesh Access Points (MAPs), serving paying customers for Internet access. Our study involved the collection of multi-modal data, including continuous SNMP logs, syslogs, passive traffic capture, and limited active measurements across different parts of the city. The study is divided into four components: planning and deployment of the mesh, the effectiveness of mesh routing techniques, user experience, and usage characterization. During our 8-month data collection period, the network underwent several changes due to hardware and software upgrades. To present a consistent view, the core dataset used in this paper comes from a two-week excerpt, which includes over 1.7 million SNMP log entries from 224 MAPs and more than 100 hours of active measurements. This extensive study allowed us to make critical observations essential for planning and using WiFi meshes as an Internet access technology. For instance, we found that the last hop 2.4GHz wireless link between the mesh and the client is a major bottleneck in client performance. Additionally, deploying MAPs on utility poles can result in degraded performance for indoor clients due to poor signal reception.

## 1. Introduction
The widespread availability of WiFi and the benefits of low-cost, tetherless network deployment have driven significant interest in wireless mesh networks. As the initial excitement has waned, the practical challenges of making such networks viable have become apparent. The research community has dedicated considerable effort to understanding and addressing the performance issues of multi-hop wireless communication. Recent advancements include new channel-aware routing metrics like ETX [1] and WCETT [2], innovative routing strategies such as ExOR [3], COPE [4], MORE [5], and CLONE [6], and channel planning and assignment strategies [7, 8]. Several vendors, including Cisco Systems, Firetide, Motorola, Strix Systems, and Tropos Networks, have also developed commercial-grade mesh networking solutions for various applications, such as municipal Internet access, public safety, and commercial use.

Several detailed and insightful measurement studies have characterized the performance of moderate-scale, primarily home-grown and organically expanding mesh networks. Examples include the Roofnet testbed in Cambridge, MA [11], the TFA-Mesh in Houston, TX [9], and the Digital Gangetic Plains project in India [12]. Research-driven deployments often use off-the-shelf components and provision additional capabilities for measurement and experimentation, with services typically offered at no cost. In contrast, commercial networks must meet high user expectations for stability and availability, necessitating careful deployment, engineering, and tuning for high-quality performance. While many studies have documented the experiences of mesh networks, there is a need for systematic studies of commercial-grade WiFi meshes.

### 1.1 Study Goals
Our study, spanning over 8 months, aims to address a broad range of questions, evaluating both existing phenomena and the relevance of ongoing research efforts to improve performance. These categories include:

- **Mesh Planning and Deployment**: What are the deployment strategies and their effectiveness for a large-scale mesh network in an urban area? How well does the deployment handle failures?
- **Mesh Routing Strategies**: What common routing mechanisms are used, and how do they perform?
- **User Experience**: What is the client performance in different parts of the mesh network?
- **Usage Characterization**: How is the mesh utilized by users?

While it is risky to generalize based on a single deployment, the relative success of this network makes it a reasonable starting point for future evaluations.

### 1.2 MadMesh Architecture and Use
MadMesh is primarily composed of Cisco 1510 MAPs, organized into a tree structure with Root Access Points (RAPs) serving as roots. RAPs typically have wired Internet access, but in MadMesh, they use special licensed wireless frequency bands to communicate with an Internet fiber hub. Each MAP detects nearby MAPs and associates with one tree for all communication, dynamically changing its parent or switching trees based on channel conditions. A mesh controller manages all MAPs, establishing Layer 2 tunnels with each MAP upon boot-up.

The links between MAPs on a tree form the mesh backbone. Each MAP has two radio interfaces: one for the backbone (802.11a in the 5 GHz band) and one for client access (802.11b/g in the 2.4 GHz band). The backbone interfaces of MAPs on the same tree operate on the same 802.11a channel, while different trees use different channels. The access interface uses omni-directional antennas for coverage, and most backbone interfaces use sector antennas for efficient communication. All backhaul traffic is encrypted using AES, and APs support 802.11i and WPA security.

MadMesh provides Internet access to users for a fixed monthly fee, varying with the quality of service. It serves over 1000 residential customers, provides backhauling for ISPs and small businesses, and offers wireless services to public safety organizations.

### 1.3 Main Observations
- **Robustness - Local vs. Global**: Each MAP has good local connectivity, but a single link failure can partition the network, indicating a lack of global redundancy.
- **Bottleneck - Access Link**: The mesh backbone is robust, but the 2.4GHz access link is the primary bottleneck due to interference. MAPs on utility poles and indoor clients with low-power devices contribute to poor signal quality.
- **Routing Paths - Flapping**: Routing paths exhibit flapping behavior, with about 10% of MAPs experiencing frequent route changes. Dampening mechanisms are needed to mitigate this.
- **Management - Client Feedback**: Traditional management tools rely on SNMP data from MAPs, but client feedback is crucial for identifying real performance issues.
- **Applicability of Research - Network Coding and Opportunistic Routing**: Our measurements suggest that these mechanisms can be beneficial in outdoor mesh deployments.
- **User Characteristics - Night-Time Peaks and Uneven Usage**: Traffic volumes peak in late evenings and night hours, and client distribution among MAPs is uneven.

### 1.4 Roadmap
The rest of the paper is structured as follows:
- **Section 2**: Measurement Methodology
- **Sections 3-6**: Detailed analysis of mesh planning and deployment, mesh routing strategies, user experience, and usage characteristics
- **Section 7**: Related work and context
- **Section 8**: Conclusions

## 2. Measurement Methodology
Our study collected data over 8 months, with limitations due to the commercial nature of the network. We combined passive and active data to understand the overall characteristics of the network.

### 2.1 Periodic Infrastructure Logs
We polled SNMP records from all active MAPs every three minutes, collecting over 150 parameters per MAP. We also had access to management tools and syslogs at the mesh controller.

### 2.2 Passive Monitoring
We placed monitoring nodes at strategic locations, including outdoor utility poles, indoor residential areas, and a mobile node on a city bus. Although client traffic was encrypted, MAC-level headers were available for analysis.

### 2.3 Active Measurements
To supplement passive data, we conducted active measurements using tools like iperf. Over the 8-month period, the network underwent changes, so the core dataset used in this paper comes from a two-week period in late November and early December 2007, including over 1.7 million SNMP log entries and more than 100 hours of active measurements.

Based on these datasets, we present our observations in the following sections.

## 3. On Mesh Planning and Deployment
In this section, we discuss the topological properties of MadMesh, focusing on the following questions:
- **Deployment Strategies and Effectiveness**: What are the deployment strategies, and how effective are they in handling failures?
- **Topology Analysis**: What are the key topological properties of the network, and how do they impact performance?
