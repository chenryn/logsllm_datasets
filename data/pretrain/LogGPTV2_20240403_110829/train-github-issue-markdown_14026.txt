Enable a filtered query to apply filter to both parent and child documents but
return parent documents for has_child query.
e.g.  
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/foobar" -d
"{"mappings":{"Foo":{},"Bar":{"_parent":{"type":"Foo"}}}}"
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/foobar/Foo/1" -d
"{"foo":"abc","access":"yes"}"
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/foobar/Bar/2?parent=1" -d
"{"bar":"xyz","access":"no"}"
The following filtered query would not return a result, since the filter would
be applied to both the parent and child documents; however, as implemented
now, the parent document would be returned, since the filter is not applied to
the child document.
    {
       "query": {
          "filtered": {
             "query": {
                "has_child": {
                   "type": "Bar",
                   "query": {
                      "term": {
                         "bar": "xyz"
                      }
                   }
                }
             },
             "filter": {
                "term": {
                   "access": "yes"
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
Perhaps an additional filtered_query strategy could be specified which would
apply the filter first to both parent and child documents.
