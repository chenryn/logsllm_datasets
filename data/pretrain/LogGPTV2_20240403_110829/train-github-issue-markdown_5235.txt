I've a problem with Celery parent thread. It works, but CPU consumption is
near 100%.  
Top output is:  
28337 xxx 20 0 658m 101m 35m R 100 0.6 844:58.47 celery
Celery version is:  
celery report  
software -> celery:3.1.8 (Cipater) kombu:3.0.10 py:2.7.3  
billiard:3.3.0.14 py-amqp:1.4.2  
platform -> system:Linux arch:64bit, ELF imp:CPython  
loader -> celery.loaders.default.Loader  
settings -> transport:amqp results:disabled
Strace shows repeated epoll_ctl calls.  
strace -p 28337  
epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_DEL, 28, {EPOLLRDNORM|EPOLLWRBAND|0x4c6820, {u32=0,
u64=21512400263970816}}) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)  
epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_DEL, 32, {EPOLLRDNORM|EPOLLWRBAND|0x4c6820, {u32=0,
u64=21512400263970816}}) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)  
epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_DEL, 36, {EPOLLRDNORM|EPOLLWRBAND|0x4c6820, {u32=0,
u64=21512400263970816}}) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

I have JSON serializer and some connections to HBase in my workers.
