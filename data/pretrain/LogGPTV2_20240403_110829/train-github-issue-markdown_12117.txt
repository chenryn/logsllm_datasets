A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
#### How to reproduce the bug
  1. Go to https://superset.apache.org/docs/api
  2. Scroll down the page.
  3. You will see that the page will not scroll to the end. This applies to multiple pages in the documentation.
Pressing PgDown on keyboard or using documentation sidebar navigation also
fails.
### Expected results
The user should be able to scroll through the full page of documentation to
the end.
### Actual results
The screen won't scroll vertically below the text that was visible when the
page loaded. The visible screen bounces back up to the beginning of the
document.
#### Screenshots
This is as far as the page scrolls.
