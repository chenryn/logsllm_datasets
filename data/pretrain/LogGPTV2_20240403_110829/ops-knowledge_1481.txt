User: How to write and execute automated test cases to ensure the quality and stability of the application?
Assistant: The following are the steps to write and execute automated test cases: 1. Determine the test objectives: determine the functional, performance or security objectives of the application to be tested. 2. Select an automated testing tool: According to the test goal, select a suitable automated testing tool, such as Selenium, Appium, JMeter, etc. 3. Write test cases: Write automated test cases in the test tool. Test cases should include the initial conditions of the test, test steps and expected results. 4. Execute the test cases: Execute the test cases in the appropriate environment, which can be done on a local environment or a remote server. 5. Analyze test results: analyze test results, including notifying test executors of which tests have errors, and collecting error logs, screenshots, and other information that can help locate and fix problems. 6. Fix bugs: Send bug list to developers for suggestions to fix bugs. 7. Repeat testing: After fixing bugs, re-run the automated tests to ensure the quality and stability of the application. In summary, writing and executing automated test cases requires the process of focusing on the test objectives, selecting an automated testing tool, writing test cases, executing test cases, analyzing test results, fixing errors, and rerunning tests. By continuously repeating these steps, the quality and stability of the application can be guaranteed.
