Cautions
■ Aternity and Riverbed reintegration: Aternity was spun off from its parent company
Riverbed in 2019. It has recently been brought back into the organization. This
reintegration and uncertainty have caused clients to be hesitant about adopting
Aternity products.
■ No security capability or product: Aternity lacks products that add security to the
APM portfolio.
■ Low market awareness: Aternity has a significant focus on the DEM aspect of APM,
with less market awareness of its core APM capabilities.
SolarWinds
SolarWinds is a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM product set is focused on
providing services via SaaS and on-premises monitoring. Its operations are geographically
diverse, and its clients include small organizations, large global enterprises and
governmental organizations. SolarWinds’ roadmap includes plans for a new observability
suite that combines all the functionality of the separate tools in a single SaaS package.
Other enhancements include new AIOps capabilities.
Strengths
■ Breadth of coverage: SolarWinds has a strong complementary suite of products,
covering much of the typical IT operations workload. These include products for
network, database, security and configuration management.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 19 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Pricing: SolarWinds’ new integrated bundle will mean that APM pricing is more
attractive for clients looking for an integrated solution for monitoring. In particular, it
is likely to be an attractive option for companies looking to implement APM with a
limited budget.
■ Ease of use: SolarWinds has designed many of its products to be self-service, with
simple installation models for smaller deployments.
Cautions
■ Ongoing impact of supply chain attack: SolarWinds continues to be affected by the
SUNBURST hack of December 2020. Gartner notes that some clients, and especially
government bodies, are not considering SolarWinds as a possible solution, due to its
association with the attack.
■ Lack of integration: SolarWinds’ APM product suite suffers from a lack of
integration among suite offerings, with a noticeable difference in user experience
among suite products, as well as with other SolarWinds products, such as Orion. As
noted, SolarWinds plans to launch a new, integrated observability suite later in 2022.
■ Portfolio overlap: SolarWinds’ portfolio contains a number of overlapping products
with similar capabilities. It is not always clear which SolarWinds tool is the most
suitable for a particular use case.
Splunk
Splunk is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM products combine metrics, traces
and log analysis, end-user experience and incident response capabilities through various
products aggregated in its Splunk Observability Cloud offering. Its operations are
geographically diverse, and its clients tend to be enterprise organizations. The company
continues to invest in its APM functionality by enhancing code-level visibility and
acquisitions focused on enhancing its offerings in areas, such as real user monitoring,
synthetic transaction monitoring (STM), cloud network monitoring and business
workflows. A key aspect of the roadmap is gaining deeper monitoring and security
insights with Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise integration with Splunk Log Observer.
Strengths
■ Support for the large environments: Splunk has a large presence in log monitoring
and SIEM, which enables it to introduce and cross-sell APM solutions to existing
customers.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 20 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Continuous visibility of code-level performance: Splunk’s APM Service Map clearly
shows the topological relationships of the services affected during an error or
outage. The code profiler visualizes bottlenecks in code and performs deeper
examinations of spans to optimize the performance of applications.
■ OpenTelemetry support: The Splunk APM is OpenTelemetry-native, making the
product simple and intuitive. This makes the Splunk APM effective for cloud-native,
service-based and mesh app and service architecture (MASA) applications.
Cautions
■ Complex licensing structure: Splunk introduced simplified single SKU pricing for
Observability Cloud. When purchased alongside Splunk Enterprise, however, pricing
can be complex and relatively high, especially for low volumes of hosts.
■ Lacking full integration: Splunk is still working to integrate its entire suite of APM
and observability offerings with Splunk Synthetics (Rigor) and Cloud Network
monitoring (Flowmill) not yet integrated. Some clients have expressed confusion on
the need for two separate log solutions (Log Observer and Splunk Cloud).
■ Geographic presence: Splunk Observability Cloud does not have a point of presence
in the APAC region. Splunk Observability’s regional availability is expected to expand
in the coming year from the U.S./EMEA (via AWS/GCP) to APAC.
Sumo Logic
Sumo Logic is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its Observability platform is focused
on providing availability, performance and security analysis via SaaS monitoring. Its
operations are geographically diverse, and its clients include enterprise and midmarket
segments. Sumo Logic’s roadmap includes enhancing analytics coverage within alert
response, enhancing tracing and RUM capabilities, and embracing open source with
contributions to OpenTelemetry.
Strengths
■ Pricing model: Sumo Logic’s pricing model is based on capacity, credit and data
tiering. This makes it easy for clients to analyze and manage costs as their data
grows. Sumo Logic contracts are essentially drawdown contracts, in which clients
purchase credits that may be used for any product in the portfolio.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 21 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Telemetry deployment flexibility: Sumo Logic supports many different agents for
collecting data, based on the telemetry type. Sumo Logic has full support for
OpenTelemetry, which can collect telemetry from applications, OSs, databases and
end users. It also has a proprietary agent that can collect telemetry from
applications, OSs, databases and end users.
■ Cloud Integration: Sumo Logic has strong native integrations with cloud service
providers (CSPs). It can ingest and analyze data from multiple clouds, including
AWS, Azure, GCP and private clouds.
Cautions
■ Lack of an STM capability: Sumo Logic does not have STM. It integrates with
Catchpoint’s DEM solution to monitor the end user’s digital experience.
■ Code-level analytics and dashboard coverage: Sumo Logic’s application tracing
lacks the maturity of some competitors’ offerings. Drill-down into business KPIs,
session data and traces requires manual configuration. Analytics and dashboard
features also require some manual efforts.
■ SaaS-only deployment: Sumo Logic only offers a SaaS product, and no on-premises
deployment option is available. This means it may not be suitable for clients that
have regulations around data sovereignty, although customers may keep data in the
AWS region of their choice.
VMware (TO)
VMware is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability platform, Tanzu
Observability (TO) by Wavefront, is more observability than APM. It has been used by
enterprises, startups and service providers as a time-series-based monitoring platform,
adding the capability to ingest and analyze OpenTelemetry-distributed traces into TO-
enabled VMware. This addresses a broader set of customer APM needs. Its operations are
geographically diverse, and its clients tend to be enterprises and service providers of all
sizes. The product roadmap includes support for ingesting and analyzing logs; adding
DEM through RUM and synthetics, which are being collected via integration with
Catchpoint; and expanding use of AI/ML.
Strengths
■ Scalable ingestion: Support for metrics-intensive workloads — into the millions of
data points per second — has long been one of Tanzu Observability’s differentiators.
This model is being carried over to traces and logs. Organizations sensitive to node-
based licensing may find such a capacity-based model appealing.
Gartner, Inc. | G00750730 Page 22 of 37
This research note is restricted to the personal use of hao.xiangshan@yottabyte.cn.
■ Agent independence: Rather than create its own agent, VMware recommends the use
of the open-source InfluxData Telegraf agent to collect telemetry that is passed to
Tanzu Observability via its proxy, which also acts as an OpenTelemetry Receiver.
Flexible ingestion via standard interfaces makes the product easier to deploy and
reduces time to value.
■ Operational expansion: VMware plans to double Tanzu Observability’s geographic
footprint in 2022, from four countries in the North America, EMEA and the APAC
regions to eight.
Cautions
■ Lack of native DEM: VMware relies on an external company (Catchpoint) for DEM,
which limits its ability to control innovation in this area. Alternatively, customers may
pass DEM data into VMware via the agent and proxy. Although OpenTelemetry-
native applications can send DEM telemetry that way, the number of these
applications is limited. VMware plans to release RUM and synthetic monitoring
capability in 2023. However, requiring a subscription to an additional service provider
may discourage prospective customers.
■ Platform bundling: Although Tanzu Observability is available and is often purchased
as a stand-alone product, as a business unit of VMware, the Tanzu Observability
product roadmap and GTM strategy depends heavily on the priorities of its parent
company. Despite substantial synergies with VMware’s Kubernetes-based Tanzu
product family, the product’s capabilities go well beyond serving as a monitoring
solution for Kubernetes-based infrastructure and applications.
■ Visibility: Tanzu Observability comes up in a small percentage of Gartner client
inquiries. The APM and observability market is quite competitive, especially lately.
Given the size and scale of the VMware portfolio, it will be difficult for Tanzu
Observability to achieve the visibility necessary to be successful in it.
Vendors Added and Dropped
We review and adjust our inclusion criteria for Magic Quadrants as markets change. As a
result of these adjustments, the mix of vendors in any Magic Quadrant may change over
time. A vendor's appearance in a Magic Quadrant one year and not the next does not
necessarily indicate that we have changed our opinion of that vendor. It may be a
reflection of a change in the market and, therefore, changed evaluation criteria, or of a
change of focus by that vendor.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
For Gartner clients, Magic Quadrant and Critical Capabilities research identifies, then
analyzes the most relevant providers and their products in a market. Gartner uses by
default an upper limit of 20 providers to support the identification of the most relevant
providers in a market. On some specific occasions, the upper limit may be extended by
Methodologies, where the intended research value to our clients might otherwise be
diminished. The inclusion criteria represent the specific attributes that analysts believe are
necessary for inclusion in this research.
To qualify for inclusion, providers must demonstrate the capability to observe an
application’s complete transaction behavior, through proprietary agent technology and/or
distributed tracing. The vendor must demonstrate the capability to automatically collect
data from at least three modern application frameworks:
■ Java Virtual Machines (JVMs)
■ .NET CLRs
■ PHP
■ Ruby

■ Automated discovery and mapping of application and its infrastructure components
(including cloud services)
■ Monitoring of applications running on mobile (native and browser) and desktop
browser
■ Identification and analysis of application performance problems and their impact on
business outcomes
■ Native integration capabilities with automation and service management tools, as
well as native integration with public cloud providers (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure
Monitoring, Google Cloud Operations)
■ Analysis of business KPIs and user journeys (e.g., login to check-out)
■ The ability to perform interactive interrogation of multiple telemetry types (i.e., traces,
metrics, logs) to detect “unknown unknowns” — that is, the ability to identify
underlying issues to unexpected events
■ Application security functionality, delivered via a common agent or framework for
APM.
Vendors must also satisfy the following business (nonfunctional) criteria:

■ Rank among the top 20 organizations in the market momentum index defined by
Gartner for this Magic Quadrant. Data inputs used to calculate APM Magic Quadrant
platform market momentum include a balanced set of measures:
■ Gartner customer search and inquiry volume and trend data
■ Volume of job listings specifying the Magic Quadrant platform on
TalentNeuron and on a range of employment websites
■ Frequency of mentions as a competitor to other APM platform vendors in
reviews on Gartner’s Peer Insights forum during the year ending 22 January
■ The APM offering must have generated at least $75 million in annual generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) revenue derived solely from its software-
based APM products during the 12 calendar months prior to January 2022.
Alternatively, the APM offering must have generated a minimum of $10 million in
annual revenue, combined with a growth rate of at least 25% during the 12 months
prior to January 2022, compared with its previously completed 12 months.
■ The APM offering must have at least 50 paying, production (non-beta-test)
customers in each of two or more geographic regions (APAC, EMEA, Latin America or
North America) for a minimum of 100 customers, excluding sales to MSPs.
Honorable Mention
Gartner is tracking more than 40 vendors in the APM and Observability market. This
research focuses on 19 vendors that met our inclusion criteria. However, the exclusion of a
particular vendor does not necessarily mean that it should not be considered, or that it
does not have viability capabilities that may be a fit for a customer’s unique requirements.
LogicMonitor: More widely known as a provider of SaaS-based ITIM, LogicMonitor has
expanded into observability through a combination of acquisition and engineering. It has
recently introduced APM based on OpenTelemetry, as well as improved log analysis.
LogicMonitor did not meet the inclusion criteria for this research.

Completeness of Vision
Gartner analysts evaluate vendors on their ability to convincingly articulate logical
statements about current and future market direction, innovation, customer needs and
competitive forces, and how well they map to the Gartner position. Ultimately, vendors are
rated on their understanding of how market forces can be exploited to create opportunity
for themselves. The criteria are:
■ Market Understanding: This refers to the vendor’s ability to understand buyers’
wants and needs, and to translate those into products and services. Vendors that
