### Cautions

**Aternity and Riverbed Reintegration:**
- Aternity, which was spun off from its parent company Riverbed in 2019, has recently been reintegrated into the organization. This reintegration, along with the associated uncertainty, has caused some clients to be hesitant about adopting Aternity products.

**Lack of Security Capability or Product:**
- Aternity does not offer products that enhance security within its Application Performance Management (APM) portfolio.

**Low Market Awareness:**
- While Aternity focuses significantly on the Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) aspect of APM, it has lower market awareness regarding its core APM capabilities.

### SolarWinds

**Market Position:**
- SolarWinds is classified as a Niche Player in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM product set is designed for both SaaS and on-premises monitoring, serving a diverse range of clients, including small organizations, large global enterprises, and governmental bodies. The company's roadmap includes plans for a new observability suite that consolidates all functionality into a single SaaS package, as well as the introduction of new AIOps capabilities.

**Strengths:**
- **Breadth of Coverage:** SolarWinds offers a comprehensive suite of complementary products that cover a wide range of IT operations workloads, including network, database, security, and configuration management.
- **Pricing:** The new integrated bundle makes APM pricing more attractive, particularly for clients seeking an integrated solution with a limited budget.
- **Ease of Use:** Many SolarWinds products are designed for self-service, with simple installation models suitable for smaller deployments.

**Cautions:**
- **Ongoing Impact of Supply Chain Attack:** SolarWinds continues to face repercussions from the SUNBURST hack of December 2020. Some clients, especially government bodies, are avoiding SolarWinds due to its association with the attack.
- **Lack of Integration:** The APM product suite suffers from a lack of integration among its offerings, leading to a fragmented user experience. However, SolarWinds plans to launch a new, integrated observability suite later in 2022.
- **Portfolio Overlap:** The SolarWinds portfolio contains several overlapping products with similar capabilities, making it unclear which tool is best suited for specific use cases.

### Splunk

**Market Position:**
- Splunk is categorized as a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM products combine metrics, traces, log analysis, end-user experience, and incident response capabilities through various products aggregated in the Splunk Observability Cloud. The company serves geographically diverse enterprise organizations and continues to invest in enhancing code-level visibility and acquiring technologies to improve real user monitoring, synthetic transaction monitoring, cloud network monitoring, and business workflows. Key aspects of the roadmap include deeper monitoring and security insights through integration with Splunk Cloud and Splunk Enterprise.

**Strengths:**
- **Support for Large Environments:** Splunk's strong presence in log monitoring and SIEM enables it to introduce and cross-sell APM solutions to existing customers.
- **Continuous Visibility of Code-Level Performance:** The APM Service Map provides clear topological relationships of services affected during errors or outages, while the code profiler visualizes bottlenecks and performs deep examinations to optimize application performance.
- **OpenTelemetry Support:** Splunk APM is natively compatible with OpenTelemetry, making it effective for cloud-native, service-based, and mesh app and service architecture (MASA) applications.

**Cautions:**
- **Complex Licensing Structure:** Although Splunk introduced simplified single SKU pricing for Observability Cloud, the pricing can be complex and relatively high when purchased alongside Splunk Enterprise, especially for low volumes of hosts.
- **Lacking Full Integration:** Splunk is still working to integrate its entire suite of APM and observability offerings, with tools like Splunk Synthetics (Rigor) and Cloud Network monitoring (Flowmill) not yet fully integrated. Some clients have expressed confusion over the need for two separate log solutions (Log Observer and Splunk Cloud).
- **Geographic Presence:** Splunk Observability Cloud lacks a point of presence in the APAC region, though regional availability is expected to expand in the coming year.

### Sumo Logic

**Market Position:**
- Sumo Logic is a Challenger in this Magic Quadrant. Its Observability platform focuses on providing availability, performance, and security analysis via SaaS monitoring. It serves a geographically diverse client base, including enterprise and midmarket segments. Sumo Logic’s roadmap includes enhancing analytics coverage within alert response, improving tracing and RUM capabilities, and contributing to OpenTelemetry.

**Strengths:**
- **Pricing Model:** Sumo Logic’s pricing model is based on capacity, credit, and data tiering, making it easy for clients to manage costs as their data grows. Contracts are drawdown agreements, allowing clients to purchase credits for any product in the portfolio.
- **Telemetry Deployment Flexibility:** Sumo Logic supports multiple agents for collecting telemetry, including full support for OpenTelemetry, which can collect data from applications, OSs, databases, and end users. It also has a proprietary agent for the same purpose.
- **Cloud Integration:** Sumo Logic has strong native integrations with cloud service providers (CSPs), enabling it to ingest and analyze data from multiple clouds, including AWS, Azure, GCP, and private clouds.

**Cautions:**
- **Lack of STM Capability:** Sumo Logic does not offer Synthetic Transaction Monitoring (STM). It integrates with Catchpoint’s DEM solution to monitor the end user’s digital experience.
- **Code-Level Analytics and Dashboard Coverage:** Sumo Logic’s application tracing is less mature compared to some competitors. Drill-down into business KPIs, session data, and traces requires manual configuration, as do analytics and dashboard features.
- **SaaS-Only Deployment:** Sumo Logic only offers a SaaS product, with no on-premises deployment option. This may not be suitable for clients with strict data sovereignty regulations, although data can be stored in the AWS region of their choice.

### VMware (Tanzu Observability)

**Market Position:**
- VMware is a Visionary in this Magic Quadrant. Its APM and observability platform, Tanzu Observability (TO) by Wavefront, is more focused on observability than traditional APM. It is used by enterprises, startups, and service providers as a time-series-based monitoring platform, with the capability to ingest and analyze OpenTelemetry-distributed traces. The product roadmap includes support for ingesting and analyzing logs, adding Digital Experience Monitoring (DEM) through Real User Monitoring (RUM) and synthetics, and expanding the use of AI/ML.

**Strengths:**
- **Scalable Ingestion:** Tanzu Observability supports metrics-intensive workloads, handling millions of data points per second. This capacity-based model is appealing to organizations sensitive to node-based licensing.
- **Agent Independence:** VMware recommends using the open-source InfluxData Telegraf agent to collect telemetry, which is passed to Tanzu Observability via its proxy. This flexible ingestion via standard interfaces simplifies deployment and reduces time to value.
- **Operational Expansion:** VMware plans to double Tanzu Observability’s geographic footprint in 2022, expanding from four countries in North America, EMEA, and APAC to eight.

**Cautions:**
- **Lack of Native DEM:** VMware relies on an external company (Catchpoint) for DEM, limiting its control over innovation in this area. While OpenTelemetry-native applications can send DEM telemetry, the number of such applications is limited. VMware plans to release RUM and synthetic monitoring capabilities in 2023, but requiring a subscription to an additional service provider may discourage some customers.
- **Platform Bundling:** Although Tanzu Observability is available as a stand-alone product, its roadmap and go-to-market strategy are heavily influenced by VMware’s priorities. Despite synergies with VMware’s Kubernetes-based Tanzu product family, the product’s capabilities extend beyond Kubernetes monitoring.
- **Visibility:** Tanzu Observability is mentioned in a small percentage of Gartner client inquiries. Given the competitive nature of the APM and observability market, it will be challenging for Tanzu Observability to achieve the necessary visibility for success.
