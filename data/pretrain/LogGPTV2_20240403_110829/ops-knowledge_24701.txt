User: How to use Python to write an automated script to regularly back up the database and send emails of the backup results to designated personnel?
Assistant: The following are the steps to write an automated script to achieve the above functions: 1. Install the necessary Python library: the library that needs to be installed includes pymysql, schedule, and smtplib. It can be installed using the pip command. 2. Connect to the database: use the pymysql library to connect to the MySQL database, and perform a backup operation to obtain the path of the backup file. 3. Send mail: use the smtplib library to connect to the SMTP server, create a mail object and add attachments, and finally send the mail. 4. Scheduled execution: Use the schedule library to implement scheduled backup and email operations. Here is a sample code: ```python import pymysql import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart from email.mime.application import MIMEApplication import schedule import time #Database configuration db_host = 'localhost ' db_port = 3306 db_user = 'root' db_password = 'password' db_name = 'test' # mail configuration smtp_server = 'smtp.gmail.com' smtp_port = 587 smtp_user = 'sender@gmail.com' smtp_password = 'password' receiver = 'receiver@gmail.com' # Back up the database and return the backup file path def backup_database(): conn = pymysql.connect(host=db_host, port=db_port, user=db_user, password=db_password, db=db_name) cursor = conn. cursor() backup_path = f'{db_name}.sql' with open(backup_path, 'w') as f: cursor.execute(f'dump {db_name}') for line in cursor: f.write(line[0] + '\n') cursor.close() conn.close() return backup_path # Send backup result email def send_email(backup_path): msg = MIMEMultipart() msg['From'] = smtp_user msg['To'] = receiver msg['Subject'] = 'Database Backup Report' body = 'Dear User,\n\nThe latest database backup is attached.\n\nBest regards,\nYour Database Administrator' msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain' )) with open(backup_path, 'rb') as f: attachment = MIMEApplication(f. read(), _subtype='sql') attachment. add_header('content-disposition', 'attachment', filename=backup_path) msg. attach(attachment) with smtplib.SMTP(smtp_server, smtp_port) as server: server.ehlo() server.starttls() server.login(smtp_user, smtp_password) server.sendmail(smtp_user, receiver, msg.as_string()) # Timing Execute backup and email sending operations schedule.every().day.at('12:00').do(lambda: send_email(backup_database())) while True: schedule.run_pending() time.sleep(1) `` ` Note: This code is for reference only, it needs to be modified and tested according to the actual situation in actual use.
