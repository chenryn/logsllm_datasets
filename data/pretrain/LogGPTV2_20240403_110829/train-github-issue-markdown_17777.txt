I've been having some issues on 1.3 that I haven't had on 1.2 on the same
machine. Seems like libgit2 update has broken something:
    (v1.3) pkg> up
      Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`
      Updating git-repo `https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General.git`
    ┌ Warning: Some registries failed to update:

this means I can't download any packages on 1.3. Has anyone had a similar
issue? This is a big upgrade blocker for me right now.
