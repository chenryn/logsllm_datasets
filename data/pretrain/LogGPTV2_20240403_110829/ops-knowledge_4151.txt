Question: "Alice is designing a digital signature system and needs to ensure that it has all the necessary properties to be secure and functional. Which of the following design elements should she include in her digital signature scheme?"
 "A": "A public verification key that everyone can use to encrypt messages, and a private signing key for decrypting received messages."
 "B": "A randomized algorithm for key generation that provides a unique public and private key pair each time it is invoked."
 "C": "A signing algorithm that allows anyone to generate a signature with a public key for any given message."
 "D": "A verification algorithm that checks whether a signature on a message is valid using the corresponding public key."
Answer: BD
