### Analysis of Unpredictability Scores

The unpredictability scores for the ECG biometric were estimated using polynomials of degrees from 1 (linear) to 4. The error bars in Figure 7 show the 95% confidence intervals.

- **Linear (Degree 1):** 
  - Example values: .04 ± .02, .04 ± .01, .09 ± .02, ...
  
- **Quadratic (Degree 2):**
  - Example values: .05 ± .02, .09 ± .02, .11 ± .03, ...

- **Cubic (Degree 3):**
  - Example values: .05 ± .02, .09 ± .02, .14 ± .02, ...

- **Degree 4:**
  - Example values: .06 ± .01, .10 ± .02, .15 ± .03, ...

### Observations

- The difference between the linear and degree 4 unpredictability scores is not significant according to one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum tests.
- The aggregated distribution of the click duration feature (the most relevant for the mouse movements biometric) for the trackpad has several modes, depending on whether the user uses the trackpad click button or simply taps it.
- In contrast, the click duration for the mouse device is much more consistent across users.
- Using a quadratic polynomial provides an advantage over a linear function, but this advantage saturates for degrees greater than 3.

### Conclusion

The use of higher-degree polynomials (up to degree 3) provides better estimates of unpredictability scores for the ECG biometric. However, the benefits diminish for degrees greater than 3. The variability in click duration for the trackpad compared to the mouse highlights the need for careful consideration of input device characteristics in biometric analysis.
