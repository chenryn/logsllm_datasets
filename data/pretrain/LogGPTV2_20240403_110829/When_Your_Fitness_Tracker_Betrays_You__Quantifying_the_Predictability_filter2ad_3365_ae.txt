TABLE 5: Complete RMI values and unpredictability scores for each feature in the ECG biometric, computed on the ﬁrst
session. The conﬁdence intervals are computed over the result for each user.
though the difference between the linear and the degree
4 unpredictability scores is still not signiﬁcant as for a
one-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum tests. This happens as the
aggregated distribution of the click duration feature (the
most relevant for the mouse movements biometric) for the
trackpad has several modes depending on whether the user
uses the trackpad click button or simply taps it, whereas the
click duration for mouse device is much more consistent
across users. Hence, using a quadratic polynomial provides
an advantage over linear function, however this quickly
saturates for degrees greater than 3.
Figure 7: Unpredictability score as estimated by polynomials
of degree from 1 (linear) to 4, for ECG biometric. Errorbars
show 95% conﬁdence intervals.
