pled signal is,
ˆε − ε = −n· ∆FS
(6)
For instance, the resonant frequency of gyros could
range from 19 kHz to above 30 kHz. If F = 20,000 Hz
and FS = 200 Hz, a tiny drift of 0.01 Hz in the sample rate
would result in a deviation of −1 Hz in the frequency of
the sampled signal. Due to the ampliﬁcation effect of
sample rate drifts, it is difﬁcult to induce and maintain a
DC output especially when the sensor is embedded.
4.2 Digital Amplitude Adjusting
The injected analog signal caused by mechanical reso-
nance of the sensing mass is an oscillating sinusoidal
signal. According to (4), the resulting digital signal will
also be oscillating (when ε (cid:54)= 0). However, an oscillating
digital output induced in the sensor could be interpreted
as noises or environmental interferences by the system,
Figure 3: When an oscillating analog signal is sampled
correctly, the digital signal is oscillating (left). When an
oscillating analog signal is undersampled, amplitudes of
different digital samples could be adjusted to modify the
shape of the digital signal (right).
and its effect could be limited to disturbances or denial
of service (DoS). In this subsection, we investigate the
possibility to modify the oscillating pattern of the digital
signal by modulating the amplitude of analog signals.
An essential feature of out-of-band signal injections
is that the induced analog signal will be undersampled,
resulting in distortions of the signal. While aliasing is
a well-known effect of signal distortions caused by un-
dersampling, it mainly focuses on changes of the signal
in the frequency domain, and how to utilize such distor-
tions to intentionally modify the ‘shape’ of an oscillating
digitized signal has rarely been discussed.
Due to undersampling, the pattern of the analog sig-
nal may not be preserved in the digital signal. As illus-
trated in Figure 3, when an amplitude modulated oscillat-
ing analog signal is sampled correctly, the digital signal
has an amplitude that changes gradually and still presents
an oscillating pattern. However, when an oscillating ana-
log signal is undersampled, amplitudes of different digi-
tal samples within one cycle of oscillation (T = 1
ε ) could
be adjusted to modify the shape of the digital signal. In
fact, when F > FS
2 , the continuity in the amplitude of the
oscillating analog signal kept in digitized samples begins
to decrease. As 2F
grows, amplitudes of adjacent sam-
FS
ples become less dependent on each other. When F is
considerably larger than FS
2 , each digital amplitude can
be adjusted independently. We have,
V [i] = A[i]· sin(2πε i
FS
+ φ0)
(i ∈ {0,1,2,3, ...})
(7)
where A[0],A[1],A[2], ... could be adjusted by modu-
lating the amplitude of the oscillating analog signal. In
this way, during out-of-band signal injections, a digi-
tal signal with speciﬁc waveforms (such as a one-sided
waveform in Section 5.1) instead of an oscillating signal
could be fabricated.
4.3 Phase Pacing
In this subsection, we propose a novel approach to ma-
nipulate the phase of the oscillating digitized signal by
changing the frequency of out-of-band analog signals.

cumulated in the target direction.
Assuming that the injected analog signals are modu-
lated with a high amplitude Ah and a low amplitude Al

The average angular speed during one cycle is:

(20)
When Al = 0, the heading angle accumulated in one
cycle would be Ah
πε , and the average angular velocity
would be Ah
π . Attackers can adjust these values by adopt-
ing different values of Ah. The principle of Side-Swing
attacks is illustrated in Figure 5.
We conduct Side-Swing attacks on the gyroscope of
an iPhone 5. As shown in Figure 6, while the phone is
stationary, the collected gyroscope data shows that it has
rotated to the positive direction of X-axis for 17.6 rads
(1008◦) in about 25 seconds. The peak angular speed
ωmax is 4.73 rad/s and the average angular speed ¯ω is
0.70 rad/s. The ratio of ¯ω to ωmax is 0.15.
In summary, Side-Swing attacks induce the outputs
mainly in the target direction and allow the derived head-
ing angle to be manipulated. In control systems, the mov-

ing direction and speed of actuators are often determined
by the measured angular velocity and the derived head-
ing angle. Therefore, Side-Swing attacks could provide
attackers a more direct way to manipulate the control
system by modulating the amplitude of acoustic signals.
However, during Side-Swing attacks, the derived head-
ing angle increases in only half of each period of the sig-
nal and stops growing when the signal is in the opposite
direction. This may limit the maximum heading angle
accumulated in a certain amount of time.
5.2 Switching Attack
The principle of Switching attacks is to control the in-
duced output by manipulating the phase of the digital
signal with repetitive phase pacing.
Recall (8) and (15) in Section 4.3, when ε1 · ε2  0, ε2 < 0 and |ε1| = |ε2| = ε
to simplify the discussion. The average angular speed in
one period of the signal is

MEMS inertial sensors are widely used in consumer, in-
dustrial, and low-end tactical control systems [55, 58].
Depending on the application, the control algorithm and
usage of inertial sensors might be different. Therefore,
a key question is: Can non-invasive spooﬁng attacks on
embedded inertial sensors deliver adversarial control to
various types or just one particular type of systems? The
answer to this question will give us a clearer understand-
ing of the potential attack scope and facilitate the eval-
uation of vulnerabilities that might ubiquitously exist in
control systems relying on MEMS inertial sensors.
We evaluate the non-invasive attacks on various types
of real systems equipped with MEMS inertial sensors.
The results of our attack experiments are summarized
in Table 1 and Table 2. Among the 25 tested devices,
17 devices are susceptible to implicit control.
In re-
maining devices, 2 of them can be controlled very lim-
itedly due to insufﬁcient sound strength and 4 of them
are vulnerable to DoS attacks. Only 2 devices are not
affected by acoustic signals. Our proof-of-concept at-
tacks demonstrate implicit control over various systems
including self-balancing, aiming and stabilizing, motion
tracking and controlling, navigation systems, etc.
In our experiments, we ﬁnd that attacks on gyros
induce more responsive actuations in the system and
demonstrate more adversarial control than attacks on ac-
celerometers. Possible reasons could be that gyros are
usually more sensitive, and in most control systems with
both gyros and accelerometers, the heading angle of the
device is mainly derived from angular velocities mea-
sured by gyros, while accelerometers are often used as
a gravity sensor and could slowly calibrate the derived
orientation information.
6.1 Attack Overview
Without accessing the real-time inertial sensor data, it
could be difﬁcult for attackers to decide when to change
the amplitude or frequency of acoustic signals so that
malicious sensor data is induced in the target direction.
However, we ﬁnd that decisions made by control systems
could give away certain information about the induced
