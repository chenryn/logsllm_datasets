instances of a certain class: 
 Cardinality constraints point out how many times
 the property can be used on an instance. Examples
include owl:maxCardinality, owl:minCardinality, and elements are some examples. owl:equivalentProperty
owl:cardinality. states a property that relates the same subject and
owl:maxCardinality: Defines the set of individu- object pairs as another property. E.g., the property
als that have at most N distinct values of the property “lectures” is equivalent to “teaches” and in OWL this
concerned. E.g., we can specify that the class “depart- can be represented as:
ment” has at most 30 members:
 The owl:inverseOf element is used to define an
 inverse relation between properties. If property P’ is
 the inverse of property P, then X is related to Y by P,
 iff Y is related to X by the P’. E.g., “teacher teaches
 a course” is the inverse of “a course is taught by a
 teacher.” In OWL:
owl:minCardinality: Defines the set of individu- 
als that have at least N distinct values of the property 
concerned. E.g., a course must be taught at least by 
one teacher: 
 Properties have some characteristics that can be
 defined directly:
• Functional property: Functional properties
(owl:FunctionProperty) have at most one value
for each instance.
• InverseFuncionalProperty: Inverse function-
al properties (owl:InverseFuncionalProperty)
are properties whose inverse property is func-
 tional. E.g., a property such as “#isMotherOf”
 is inverse functional.
• Transitive property: The transitive property is

cardinality which is equal to the maximum cardinality. • Symmetric property: The symmetric property
(owl:SymmetricProperty) is interpreted as fol-
lows: the pair (x, y) is an instance of A iff the
pair (y, x) is also an instance of A.
Properties’ characteristics add more expressivity to
OWL. owl:equivalentProperty and owl:inverseOf
The following example illustrates the 
owl:SymmetricProperty and owl:TransitiveProperty
elements. Nowadays, several companies and projects rely on
semantics to implement more advanced applications.
