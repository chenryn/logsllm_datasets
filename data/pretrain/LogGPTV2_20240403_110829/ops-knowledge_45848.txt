User: I'm creating a simple app that can play audio files (currently only mp3 files) located on a webserver.
Currently, I'm using Python's SimpleHTTPServer server side, and the AVAudioPlayer for iOS.
It sort of works, since the file is streamed over HTTP instead of just being downloaded from the webserver. But I often experience that the playback of a file is suddenly restarted. 
I'm considering using another method of streaming, eg. RTMP, but on the other hand I want to keep things simple. I'm wondering if another HTTP server might do the trick? Any other experiences/suggestions?
Assistant: What happens when the playback is restarted?  Print the HTTP URLs on the server. Does the player start from index=0, go to index=4000, then back to index=0 again?
