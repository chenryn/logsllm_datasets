 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**  
I believe there is a bug in React 16.4 regarding the
`getDerivedStateFromProps`.
**What is the current behavior?**  
Trying to set the state based on the props kind of overrides the state
forever, which makes it impossible to edit it later on.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**  
Example is as follows: http://jsbin.com/yawasoz/1/edit?html,js,output  
Add some item, click on it, try to edit it.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
To work like this (React 16.3):

**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
I think this happens only in React 16.4, 16.3 seems to work fine (same code,
different React version): http://jsbin.com/luzimujiwi/1/edit?html,js,output
