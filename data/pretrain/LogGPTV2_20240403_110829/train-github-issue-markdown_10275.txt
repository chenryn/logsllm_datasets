Atom 0.123.0 on Ubuntu/Linux 14.04 (Unity) -- enhancement
The menu control for a setting like Toggle Soft Wrap should have a visible
status-check for On/Off, e.g., a button-dot or a checkmark, beside it in the
menu (View for this one), so the user can tell at a glance what that features
current setting is...
Soft Wrap should _not_ be a global editor setting, but should be applied on a
syntax/file-type basis. For example, I'd (likely) want soft wrap set On always
for plain text files (e.g., *.txt), but always Off for Ruby code.
