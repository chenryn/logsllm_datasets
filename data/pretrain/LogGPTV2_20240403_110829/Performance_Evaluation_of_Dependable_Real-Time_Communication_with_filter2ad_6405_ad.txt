to DR-connections in the network. This ideal average band- 
width is computed by  the following formula: 
bandwidth of one link 
avg. no. of realtinie channels on one link 
-  BW  x Edge 
- 
NChan x avghop 
where BW  represents the bandwidth of one link, Edge rep- 
resents  the  number of  edges in  the  network, NChan  rep- 
resents  the number of channels in  the system, and avghop 
represents average hops of channels. The small discrepancy 
between  the  simulation  and analytical  results  is due to the 
difference between  the  assumption on  the  network  topol- 
ogy and the reality of the generated network topology.  We 
assumed that all the nodes in the network show same behav- 
iors, but in reality, the leaf nodes have different behaviors as 
compared to the non-leaf nodes. 
Table 1 shows the average bandwidth for different incre- 
ment sizes of bandwidth. The label  “Random” in the table 
represents  a random  network using the Waxman model and 
“Tier” represents a transit-stub network model  [ 141.  Note 
that  the  actual  number of  DR-connections in  the  “tiered” 
network is much less than the number of connections shown 
in the left column. This is because most DR-connections are 
rejected due to the shortage of bandwidths in the transit-stub 
network. The number of connections shown in the left col- 
umn represents the number of connections which have been 
tried to be set up. The table shows no difference in the aver- 
age bandwidth even though they have a different number of 
states.  The two schemes show a similar average behavior, 
but the scheme with a smaller increment size provides band- 
width close to the average bandwidth. However, the scheme 
with  a smaller increment size changes its  bandwidth  more 
frequently  than the scheme with a larger increment size. 
Figure 3  shows the  average bandwidth when  the  num- 
ber  of  nodes in the  network  varies.  The number of nodes 
is  varied  from  100 to  500.  Networks  are  randomly  gen- 
erated  using  the Waxman  distribution  with  a = 0.33 and

p = 0. The number of DR-connections loaded is 3000. The 
solid  line represents the  analytical  results and  the  dashed 
line represents  the simulation results. The upper dotted line 
represents the  number of edges in  the randomly-generated 
network.  The number of edges increases rapidly  with  the 
number of nodes when the parameters of Waxman distribu- 
tion remains unchanged. 
Figure 4 shows the effect of link failures in the network. 
The network is randomly generated with  100 nodes and 354 
edges. A Markov chain with 9 states is used to evaluate the 
effect.  The failure rate is varied  from 0.001 to 0.0000001. 
The DR-connection request arrival and termination rates are 
set to 0.001. The solid (labeled “Avg2OOOft”) and dotted (la- 
beled  “Avg3OOOft”) lines represent the  average bandwidth 
of  real-time  channels when  there are 2000 and  3000 real- 
time channels in the network, respectively. The result shows 
no effect of link failures on the average bandwidth since the 
link failure rate is too small compared to the DR-connection 
request arrival and termination  rates.

QoS. Fault-tolerance is  achieved  with  the  backup-channel 
reservation  scheme and the elastic QoS described by a min- 
max model.  Our analysis is based  on the development of a 
Markov model  for the dynamics of DR-connections. Three 
parameters characterizing transitions between states are ar- 
rival  of  a  new  DR-connection,  termination of  an  existing 
DR-connection,  and  activation  of  backup  channels  to  re- 
cover from a component failure. The probabilities of transi- 
tioning to different states are functions of network topology 
and network congestion. Since the network considered here 
is a random point-to-point network like the Internet, it is al- 
most  impossible to find closed-form expressions for these 
transition  probabilities.  Since these  probabilities must  be 
obtained from real  networks, we derived them using realis- 
tic simulations. Using the Markov model, we have analyzed 
the  average  bandwidth  reserved  for  each  DR-connection 
and  shown the trend  of  average bandwidth change caused 
by  the  increase of  network  load.  The  proposed  analysis 
model can  be expanded to include other issues  related  to, 
for example, network traffic.
