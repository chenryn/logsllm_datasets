### Connections and Fair Distribution of Resources

The solid line in the figure represents the simulation results, while the dashed line with x marks indicates the analytical results derived from a 9-state Markov chain (A = 50 Kbps). The top dotted line signifies the ideal average bandwidth of the network when all resources are fully utilized and equally distributed.

### Figure 2: Average Bandwidth as the Number of DR-Connections Increases

**Ideal Average Bandwidth Calculation:**

The ideal average bandwidth is computed using the following formula:

\[
\text{Ideal Average Bandwidth} = \frac{\text{Bandwidth of one link} \times \text{Number of edges}}{\text{Average number of real-time channels on one link} \times \text{Average hops}}
\]

Where:
- \( BW \) represents the bandwidth of one link.
- \( \text{Edge} \) represents the number of edges in the network.
- \( NChan \) represents the number of channels in the system.
- \( \text{avghop} \) represents the average number of hops for the channels.

**Discrepancy Between Simulation and Analytical Results:**

The small discrepancy between the simulation and analytical results can be attributed to the differences between the assumed network topology and the actual generated network topology. In our model, we assumed that all nodes in the network exhibit the same behavior, but in reality, leaf nodes have different behaviors compared to non-leaf nodes.

### Table 1: Comparison of Average Bandwidth for Different Increment Sizes

| No. of Channels | Random (Waxman Model) | Tier (Transit-Stub Model) |
|-----------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1               |                        |                           |
| 5               |                        |                           |
| 9               |                        |                           |

Note: The "Random" label in the table refers to a random network generated using the Waxman model, while "Tier" refers to a transit-stub network model [14]. The actual number of DR-connections in the "tiered" network is significantly lower than the number shown in the left column, as many DR-connections are rejected due to insufficient bandwidth in the transit-stub network. The number of connections in the left column represents the attempted connections.

### Figure 3: Average Bandwidth as the Number of Nodes Varies

This figure shows the average bandwidth when the number of nodes in the network varies from 100 to 500. Networks are randomly generated using the Waxman distribution with parameters \( \alpha = 0.33 \) and \( \beta = 0 \). The number of DR-connections loaded is 3000. The solid line represents the analytical results, and the dashed line represents the simulation results. The upper dotted line indicates the number of edges in the randomly-generated network, which increases rapidly with the number of nodes.

### Figure 4: Effect of Link Failures on Average Bandwidth

This figure illustrates the effect of link failures in the network. The network is randomly generated with 100 nodes and 354 edges. A 9-state Markov chain is used to evaluate the effect. The failure rate varies from 0.001 to 0.0000001. The DR-connection request arrival and termination rates are set to 0.001. The solid line (labeled "Avg2000ft") and the dotted line (labeled "Avg3000ft") represent the average bandwidth of real-time channels when there are 2000 and 3000 real-time channels in the network, respectively. The results show that link failures have no significant effect on the average bandwidth because the link failure rate is too small compared to the DR-connection request arrival and termination rates.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we have modeled and evaluated the performance of dependable real-time connections with elastic QoS. Fault tolerance is achieved through a backup-channel reservation scheme and an elastic QoS described by a min-max model. Our analysis is based on the development of a Markov model for the dynamics of DR-connections. Three key parameters characterizing state transitions are the arrival of a new DR-connection, the termination of an existing DR-connection, and the activation of backup channels to recover from component failures. The transition probabilities are functions of network topology and congestion. Since the network considered here is a random point-to-point network like the Internet, it is nearly impossible to derive closed-form expressions for these transition probabilities. Therefore, we obtained these probabilities through realistic simulations. Using the Markov model, we analyzed the average bandwidth reserved for each DR-connection and demonstrated the trend in average bandwidth change due to increased network load. The proposed analysis model can be extended to include other issues, such as network traffic.
