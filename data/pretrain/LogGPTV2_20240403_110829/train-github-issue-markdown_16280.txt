Hello,
I dont know if that is possible, but it would great to find a way to speed up
the `to_csv` method in Pandas.
In my admittedly large dataframe with 20 million observations and 50
variables, it takes **literally hours** to export the data to a csv file.
Reading the `csv` in Pandas is much faster though. I wonder what is the
bottleneck here and what can be done to improve the data transfer.
Csv files are ubiquitous, and a great way to share data (without being too
nerdy with `hdf5`and other subtleties). What do you think?
