### Up in the Air
- Frequent flyer miles are nice, but status is even better.
- However, sometimes improvements don't work as expected.

### IATA Resolution 792 (2005)
- **Paper**
- **PDF417**
- **Mobile**
- **QR Code**

- **DataMatrix**

### Bar-Coded Boarding Pass Example
```
M1JAROSZEWSKI/PRZEMYSLE56XXXX 
WAWCPHSK 2762 666M009C0007 666>10B0 
K6161BSK 2511799999153830 SK A3 
199999999
*3000500A3G
```

### Manipulating Boarding Passes
- **Free Fast Track for all travelers**  
  By altering the boarding pass, it is possible to gain access to fast track services.
- **Example**  
  ```
  M1COLUMBUS/CHRISTOPHERE56XXXX 
  WAWCPHSK 2762 666M009C0007 666>10B0 
  K6161BSK 2511799999153830 SK A3

  ```

### Historical Context
- **Bruce Schneier (2003):** "Flying On Someone Else’s Airplane Ticket"
- **Andy Bowers (2005):** "Dangerous Loophole in Airport Security"
- **Bruce Schneier (2006):** "The Boarding Pass Brouhaha"
- **Christopher Soghoian (2007):** "Insecure Flight: Broken Boarding Passes and Ineffective Terrorist Watch Lists"
- **Jeffrey Goldberg (2008):** "The Things He Carried"

### No Fly List Bypass (2003)
1. Buy tickets under a false name.
2. Print your boarding pass at home.
3. Create a copy of the boarding pass with your real name.
4. Present the fake boarding pass and real ID to TSA officers.
5. Present the real boarding pass to gate agents.
6. Fly.

### No Fly List Bypass (2016 Europe)
1. Buy tickets under a false name.
2. Print your boarding pass at home.
3. Fly.

### Factors Impacting Bypass
- **Airline's business consciousness**
- **Temporary security checks**

### Passenger Data Storage
- **Computer Reservation Systems (CRS)** store and process Passenger Name Records (PNR), which include:
  - Personal data (names, contact details)
  - Reservations (airlines, hotels, cars, etc.)
  - Issued tickets
  - Special requests
  - Loyalty program data
- **Dozens of CRSs exist**, including GDS (e.g., Sabre, Amadeus, Galileo, Worldspan) and proprietary systems.
- **Data access** is limited across different CRSs and parties.

### Notice of Advice
- **BCBP often contains more information** than the printed version, such as:
  - PNR locator (reservation/confirmation number, booking reference)
  - Ticket number
  - Full frequent flyer number
- This information can be used to retrieve and modify data in your PNR, including ticket cancellation.
- **Do not post or share non-anonymized boarding passes!**

### Other Systems
- **Departure Control System (DCS):** check-in info
- **Advance Passenger Information (API):** to border agencies
- **PNRGOV:** to government agencies
- **Secure Flight**

### Paper Boarding Passes
- **MS Word** is a great PDF-editing tool.
- The barcode will likely be scanned, so it needs to reflect the printed information.

### Lounge Access
- **Contract lounges:**
  - No way to verify eligibility.
  - May require an invitation issued by the airline at check-in.
- **Airline-operated lounges:**
  - May have access to passenger records, but only for their own passengers.
  - Automatic gates are increasingly popular (e.g., SAS lounges in CPH, OSL; Turkish lounge in IST).

### Duty-Free Goods
- **Eligibility** is determined based on destination (e.g., EU/Non-EU).
- Goods are sold directly to the passenger (e.g., liquors sealed in a plastic bag).

### Benefits
- **Airport access (meet&greet, sightseeing, etc.)**
- **Fast Track**
- **Free lunch and drinks**
- **Duty-free shopping**

### Digital Signature
- **IATA extended BCBP standard (ver. 3) in 2009** with support for digital signatures based on PKI.
- Many airlines still use BCBP v.1.
- The field is "optional and to be used only when required by the local security administration."
- Private keys are owned by airlines, and public keys are distributed to third parties.
- **TSA enforces this for US carriers (well, almost).**

### BCBP XML
- **IATA proposed PADIS XML in 2008** for exchanging BCBP data between airlines and third parties.
- The terminal sends a message consisting of a header and full BCBP content.
- The airline replies with a Yes/No, along with a reason and optional free text.

### Secure Flight
- **Program implemented by TSA in 2009** to take over watchlist monitoring from airlines.
- **Pre-Check and Secondary Screening introduced in 2011.**
- **Selectee indicator in BCBP field 18; 0=normal; 1=SSSS; 3=LLLL.**
- **TSA started networking CAT/BPSS devices in 2013** to pull passenger data from Secure Flight, including:
  - Passenger’s full name
  - Gender
  - Date of birth
  - Screening status
  - Reservation number
  - Flight itinerary (to determine which airports receive data)

### Is It a Vulnerability?
- **LOT Polish Airlines:** Contact Warsaw Airport about this issue.
- **Warsaw Airport:** Known issue, but compliant with CAA guidelines.
- **Civil Aviation Authority for Poland:** Boarding pass forgery is a crime.
- **Me:** Can you have a legally binding document without any form of authentication?
- **Civil Aviation Authority for Poland:** [Unprofessional response]

### Responses from Airlines
- **Turkish Airlines:** Shared your contact details with our related unit.
- **SAS:** Appreciate your feedback.
- **TSA:** [Awkward silence]

### Will It Fly?
- **NO.**
- **Seriously, don’t try!**
- But you can have a nice souvenir.

### Wrap Up
- **Privacy and complexity** of reservation systems prevent effective data exchange between airlines and BP scanning checkpoints.
- Several countermeasures have been introduced by IATA, but they are expensive and complicated to implement.
- While the US has done a reasonably good job, other places have lowered the bar.
- **Access to PNR** is likely to be limited to governments, making cross-dependencies between private entities inherently broken.
