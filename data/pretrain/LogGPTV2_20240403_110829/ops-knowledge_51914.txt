Question: You are tasked with configuring a Keymaster implementation on a device that has just booted up. Based on the Keymaster version being utilized on the device, which function should you invoke to provide the KM_TAG_OS_VERSION and KM_TAG_OS_PATCHLEVEL to Keymaster, and what is the expected behavior if the values provided do not match those provided by the bootloader?
"A": "Invoke the 'configure' function; if the values do not match the bootloader's, the method returns `KM_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.",
"B": "Invoke the 'addRngEntropy' function; if the values do not match, the method will still accept the values.",
"C": "Invoke the 'getHardwareFeatures' function; if there is a mismatch with the bootloader, the function defaults to secure hardware values.",
"D": "Invoke the 'generateKey' function; the method ignores OS version and patch level as it is only concerned with generating keys."
Answer: A
