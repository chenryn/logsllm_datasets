titleblackhat:us-22 DNSSEC Downgrade Attacks
In this talk, we show that the cryptographic agility in DNSSEC, although critical for making DNS secure with strong cryptography, also introduces a severe vulnerability. We demonstrate that adversaries, by manipulating the cryptographic material in signed DNS responses, can reduce the security level provided by DNSSEC, or, even worse, prevent resolvers from validating DNSSEC at all. We experimentally and ethically evaluate our attacks against popular DNS resolver implementations, public DNS providers, and DNS services worldwide. We validate the success of DNSSEC-downgrade attacks by poisoning the resolvers: we inject fake records, from our own signed domains, into the caches of validating resolvers. Our findings show that major DNS providers, popular resolver implementations, and many other DNS services are vulnerable to our attacks.
