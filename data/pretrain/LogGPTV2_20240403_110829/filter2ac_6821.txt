### Title: DNSSEC Downgrade Attacks in the US-22 Context

In this presentation, we explore a significant vulnerability introduced by the cryptographic agility in DNSSEC, despite its critical role in enhancing DNS security with robust cryptographic mechanisms. We demonstrate that adversaries can exploit this flexibility by manipulating the cryptographic material in signed DNS responses. This manipulation can lower the security level provided by DNSSEC or, in more severe cases, prevent resolvers from validating DNSSEC altogether.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks, we conducted experimental and ethical assessments against popular DNS resolver implementations, public DNS providers, and DNS services worldwide. Our method involved poisoning resolvers by injecting fake records from our own signed domains into the caches of validating resolvers. 

Our findings reveal that major DNS providers, widely used resolver implementations, and numerous other DNS services are vulnerable to these DNSSEC downgrade attacks.
