User: I have a requirement where 1 process sets a value as environment variable and I read that value in python using 

os.environ

As per python doc:

This mapping is captured the first
  time the os module is imported,
  typically during Python startup as
  part of processing site.py. Changes to
  the environment made after this time
  are not reflected in os.environ,
  except for changes made by modifying
  os.environ directly.

My problem is the process set/change the variable every time it calls the python script.
Please tell me a way to read the changed value.  
Thanks,
Assistant: If your process sets/updates an environment variable and then calls the Python script, you would see the updated value in your Python script. But if these are parallel processes and the environment variable gets modified when the Python script is running then the updates to the environemnt variable is not seen in the Python script.
