Question: Consider the following statements regarding system security and cryptographic principles. Which of the following statements are true based on Shannon's Maxim and related security principles?
"A": "A cryptographic system that conceals its algorithms can be considered secure as long as the algorithms remain secret.",
"B": "Security through obscurity is a robust approach because the design complexity of a system makes it difficult for attackers to understand and exploit vulnerabilities.",
"C": "In cryptographic systems, the security should not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm, but rather on the secrecy of the keys, which should be easily changeable if compromised.",
"D": "An obscure system with limited knowledge shared among few experts can lead to a false sense of security and may become vulnerable as it gains popularity."
