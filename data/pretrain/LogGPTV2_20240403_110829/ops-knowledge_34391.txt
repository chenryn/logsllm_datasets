User: How to use Ansible to automate the deployment of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) environments?
Assistant: Step 1: Preparation Before performing the steps, you need to make sure to do the following preparations: - Install Ansible - Configure Ansible - Prepare a web server Step 2: Create Ansible Playbooks Ansible playbooks are files that describe the tasks you want to accomplish. In this example, we will create two playbooks to automatically deploy the LAMP environment, namely webserver.yaml and lamp_stack.yaml. ```yaml # webserver.yaml --- - name: configure webserver packages hosts: webserver become: true tasks: - name: Install Apache yum: name=httpd state=latest - name: Start and enable Apache service: name=httpd enabled=yes state=started - name: Install PHP yum: name=php state=latest - name: Install PHP module for Apache yum: name=php-mysql state=latest - name: Restart Apache service: name=httpd state=restarted - name: Install MySQL client yum: name=mysql state=latest # lamp_stack.yaml --- - name: configure LAMP stack hosts: webserver become: true tasks: - import_playbook: webserver.yaml - name: Install MySQL server yum: name =mysqld state=latest - name: Enable and start MySQL service service: name=mysqld enabled=yes state=started ``` The first playbook, webserver.yaml install Apache, PHP and mysql clients, and make sure Apache is enabled state. The second playbook, lamp_stack.yaml inherits the tasks in webserver.yaml and adds the tasks of installing the MySQL server and starting the database service. Step 3: Execute playbooks After configuring playbooks, run ansible-playbook webserver.yaml with root privileges to run the webserver.yaml playbook. ```markup ansible-playbook webserver.yaml``` After running, you should have successfully installed Apache, PHP and mysql client on the server, and started Apache automatically. Next, you can run ansible-playbook lamp_stack.yaml as root to install the MySQL server and start the MySQL service. ```markup ansible-playbook lamp_stack.yaml ``` Now you have successfully deployed a complete LAMP environment on your server!
