User: Can someone please help and tell me how to get the celery task debug details to a log file? I have a requirement to have the details of celery task logged into a .log file.
Can you please make some suggestions on how this can be done without impacting the performance of the task?
Assistant: If you want to log everything, you can use the following command

-f celery.logs

You can also specify different log levels as well. For suppose if you want log warning and errors add like following.

--loglevel=warning -f celery.logs
