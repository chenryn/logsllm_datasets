monitored IP blocks, based on various predeﬁned combinations
of routing anomalies. Thanks to the analytical experience we
gained by investigating a large number of candidate hijack
cases, we have further enhanced our anomaly scoring and
ﬁltering method by replacing the ad-hoc decision tree with
a multi-stage aggregation system relying on Multi-Criteria
Decision Analysis (MCDA) techniques. This new MCDA-
based approach turns out to be more ﬂexible, as well as easier
to implement and maintain than a large set of ad-hoc rules. It is
also more effective at assigning a global suspiciousness score
to any given IP address block monitored by SPAMTRACER
because it removes the need to deﬁne intermediate decision
thresholds and allows to identify suspicious routing behaviors
likely resulting from a BGP hijack in a more ﬁne-grained
fashion.
MCDA provides an extensive set of methods to model
simple to very complex decision schemes, ranging from basic
averaging functions to more advanced methods such as fuzzy
integrals [17]. In our decision-making system, we rely mainly
on the Weighted Ordered Weighted Average (WOWA) opera-
tor [45] to aggregate the different individual anomaly scores at
various levels. The choice of using WOWA was motivated by
a trade-off between ﬂexibility and complexity of the decision
model. In fact, WOWA combines the advantages of two types
of averaging functions: the weighted mean (WM) and the
ordered weighted average (OWA). This enables a decision
maker to quantify, with a single operator, the reliability of the
information sources (as WM does) but also to weight the indi-
vidual scores according to their relative ordering. This sorting
and weighted ordering aspects allow us to emphasize various
distributions of scores (e.g., eliminate outliers, emphasize mid-
range values, ensure that “at least x” or “most of” the scores
are signiﬁcantly high, etc).
Obviously, like any other unsupervised technique (i.e., in
absence of reliable “ground truth” data), a number of parame-
ters must be deﬁned – usually based on the acquired expertise
and domain knowledge – to accurately model a decision
scheme and ensure that the most relevant cases are ranked
in the top tier, whereas truly benign cases are assigned very
low scores. In the case of WOWA, we only have to specify two
different weighting vectors, which already simpliﬁes consider-

ably the parameter selection phase. This said, it is important
to stress that the primary goal of our multi-stage scoring and
ﬁltering approach is to narrow down, as much as possible,
the number of cases and be able to focus on a limited set of
most promising BGP hijack candidates, which can be further
validated through manual investigation. Recall that the ultimate
goal is to prove whether (i) “BGP spectrum agility” still exists
and (ii) the modus of BGP hijacking spammers has changed
since 2006 [35]. In other words, we try to understand if this is
a problem still worth of consideration in 2014, or not. Under
these considerations, and without discrediting the importance
of parameters selection, we argue that the determination of the
optimal parameters for our decision model is, at this stage, not
critical to achieving our goals.

more details on the mathematical background behind our
MCDA scoring and aggregation system as well as its param-
eters.
C. Validation of candidate hijacks
Due to the lack of ground truth information and the
limitations of routing data alone to identify instances of BGP
hijacks, an additional validation is required and consists in
collecting additional evidence, usually involving some manual
