 **Glide Version** : 4.0.0-RC0
**Integration libraries** : OkHttp3
**Issue details / Repro steps / Use case background** :  
I'm trying to migrate from v3 to v4. Most of the things looked good until I
added `@GlideModule` into appropriate places and Glide's `annotationProcessor`
to each of my Gradle modules.
Problematic pieces of generated code are in `GlideRequests` \- 2 `as` methods:
    @Override
      public  GlideRequest as(Class resourceClass) {
        return new GlideRequest<>(glide, this, resourceClass);
      }
    @Override
      public  GlideRequest as(Class resourceClass) {
        return (GlideRequest) super.as(resourceClass);
      }
There are 3 glide modules in total:
  * 1 `AppGlideModule` that disables manifest parsing in the application Gradle module
  * 1 `LibraryGlideModule` that configures OkHttp integration in the application Gradle module
  * 1 `LibraryGlideModule` that registers some `ModelLoader`s in one of the library Gradle modules
Do not use any `GlideExtention`s or `GlideType`s.  
Tried to only apply `annotationProcessor` in the main application Gradle
module but didn't change anything. Also tried to exclude OkHttp3 integration -
no luck as well.
**Compilation error** :

Totally lost on what may be causing the issue.
