User: How to detect whether the server is under DDoS attack?
Assistant: Here are some ways to detect if your server is under DDoS attack: 1. Monitor bandwidth usage: If your bandwidth usage is unusually high, it may be because your server is under a DDoS attack. 2. Observe server logs: DDoS attacks usually cause a large number of invalid requests, which can be detected by observing server logs. 3. Network packet capture analysis: Use network packet capture tools (such as Wireshark) to analyze traffic, and you can detect whether there are a large number of requests from the same IP address. 4. Use DDoS detection tools: There are many DDoS detection tools that can monitor traffic, requests, and responses. These tools can warn you that your website is under attack. 5. Check system resource usage: DDoS attacks will take up a lot of system resources, including CPU and memory. By checking system resource usage, you can determine if there is a DDoS attack. You can use any one or several of the above methods to detect whether the server is under DDoS attack. If it is found that the server has indeed been attacked, corresponding measures can be taken to ensure the security and stability of the website.
