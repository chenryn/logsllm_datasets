### Why Computer Scientists Should Attend Hacker Conferences

At a recent computer conference, a colleague from a conservative academic institution engaged in a friendly conversation with another attendee. While such an interaction might seem unremarkable at a typical conference, this was DEFCON, and the young woman he was speaking with had a stainless steel spike tipped with a blinking green LED protruding from her lower lip. Some security researchers have described hacker conferences as "going to a graffiti convention expecting to see those who design spray cans" [1]. However, I strongly disagree. As a computer scientist, you would be remiss if you did not attend one or more hacker conferences. The effort is well worth it.

At these events, you might witness a speaker expertly navigating vulnerabilities in disassembled binaries with the skill of an Aikido master, or another demonstrating a modified game console that boots to Linux, scans an internal network, and reports back via encrypted communication paths. You might also experience (to the sound of Megadeth) teams competing in Capture the Flag and Root-Fu, engaging in intense, head-to-head war games. The intensity and talent on display will make you acutely aware that, if so inclined, these individuals could deconstruct your carefully crafted, peer-reviewed application, protocol, or algorithm and identify its weaknesses—perhaps very publicly or without a word being spoken.

To get a sense of the passion these events engender, you need only perform an Internet search on DEFCON, Interz0ne, Phreaknic, and Hackers on Planet Earth. Attendees range from respected tribal elders to immature hangers-on. My experience has shown that most attendees are intellectually curious, highly principled, authority-averse, and scientifically open-minded. The majority are genuine computer experts from highly technical computing disciplines.

For the past four years, my electrical engineering and computer science department at West Point has arranged for faculty members, staff, and students to attend hacker conferences. This decision was based on the intuition of our senior departmental leaders, who felt we would benefit personally, professionally, and, most importantly, pedagogically through exposure to the hacker community. I have now attended 11 conferences and presented at three. Each time, my colleagues and I have gained a deeper understanding of the diversity within the computer science culture, the emerging fault lines in the security boundaries of our systems, and an appreciation for the extreme technical expertise, problem-solving skills, and focus that are often marginalized by the mainstream computer science community.

Hackers are largely self- and peer-taught. Do not assume that just because they may lack formal computer science diplomas (though many do have them), they are not worth engaging. In many ways, their expertise and problem-solving abilities exceed those of their counterparts in our research laboratories and classrooms. Comments like "I was accepted at MIT but didn’t have the money to attend" and backgrounds like "when I was a Navy SEAL" are likely to be the norm rather than the exception. Gender, ethnic background, and age are profoundly irrelevant in a diverse meritocracy that glorifies what you demonstrably know. They think outside the box, unlike many of us who have been trained to think inside it.

Make no mistake; your first attendance is likely to be uncomfortable. You are unlikely to be instantly recognized as an authority in the field. Instead, you will be judged on your attitude, intelligence, creativity, and the content of your conversation. If you present your work (formally or informally), you may receive a more intense and intellectually honest review than you would from your local research group members or academic peers.

This review can be profoundly beneficial. At a recent Interz0ne conference, I gave a talk on using information visualization techniques to detect network attacks. Attendees were helpful; one pointed out the subtle similarity between two images and postulated that the attack the tools were visualizing came from the same code base, opening up an entirely new avenue of research. Another noted that a visualization technique under discussion was reminiscent of the Incan quipu. After returning home and looking up the definition of quipu, I found he was right, so I incorporated ancient communication techniques as inspiration for my current research. A third attendee wrote a favorable review of my talk and posted it to the broadly disseminated memestreams system (www.memestreams.net), leading to a dramatic increase in traffic to my research website. During a related discussion, a fourth attendee clearly explained a novel application of Fourier transforms to my work. I am indebted to these people for the help they freely provided. Engaging the community in this bidirectional manner can deliver similar rewards.

Far beyond these anecdotal examples, I have been profoundly and positively influenced by my interactions with the hacker community. First and foremost, true hackers are not the enemy. One respected hacker explained it as follows: "If a group is treated as the enemy, they will behave like one, but if they are treated as peers and experts who have something to contribute, they will rise to the challenge."

Hacker conferences have taught me to respect interdisciplinary backgrounds and diversity within the computing disciplines. Hackers' passionate pursuit of technical excellence and lifelong learning, as well as their adventurous exploration and enjoyment of technology, are qualities to be emulated. I have now altered my teaching philosophy to instill these attributes in my students. I expect them to approach problems from multiple perspectives, not just to search for what they view as the approved solution. I aim to do the same in my own research. With each conference attendance, I return to the classroom with a fresh set of experiences, ethical case studies, potential guest speakers, anecdotes, and software tools to breathe life and relevance into the classroom experience.

As you begin to explore hacker conferences, remember that you are likely stepping into a different social circle. If you treat the culture with respect, rather than writing off people different from yourself, you are likely to find a great deal of common interest. We may take different paths through life, have different motivations, or play better with certain groups, but there is a common thread—a passion for technology and an intense interest in how things work. You would do well to attend; both communities have much to learn from one another. Oh, and dress casually; a sport coat and tie are definitely not required.
