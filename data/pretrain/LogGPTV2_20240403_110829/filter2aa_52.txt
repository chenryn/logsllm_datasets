A
t a recent computer con-
ference, a colleague of
mine from a conservative
academic institution chatted
congenially with another con-
ference attendee. At a typical
conference such a conversa-
tion would be nothing partic-
ularly revealing, but this was DEFCON, and the
young lady he was speaking with had a stainless
steel spike tipped with a blinking green LED pro-
truding from her lower lip. While some security
researchers have described such conferences as
“going to a graffiti convention expecting to see
those who design spray cans” [1], I beg to differ. 
As a computer scientist you would be remiss in
not attending one or more hacker conferences. The
effort is worth it. You might see a speaker dance
through the vulnerabilities in disassembled binaries
with the skill of an Aikido master, another demon-
strate a modified game console that boots to Linux,
scans an internal network, and reports back to its
master via encrypted communication paths, or (to
the sound of Megadeth) the teams of Capture the
Flag and Root-Fu compete in head-on war games.
The intensity and talent would make you keenly
aware that, so inclined, these people could take
apart your carefully crafted, peer-reviewed applica-
tion, protocol, or algorithm and find its weak-
nesses—perhaps very publicly or without a word
being spoken. 
You need only perform an Internet search on
DEFCON, Interz0ne, Phreaknic, and Hackers on
Planet Earth to get a sense of the passion these
events engender.1 Attendees range from respected
tribal elders to immature hangers-on. Rather than
distinctly good or bad, my experience has shown
that most represent a more intellectually curious,
highly principled, authority-averse, scientifically
open-minded attitude. The majority are genuine
computer experts from highly technical computing
disciplines. 
For the past four years my electrical engineering
and computer science department at West Point has
arranged for faculty members, including me, staff,
and students to attend hacker conferences. The deci-
sion was based on the intuition of our senior depart-
mental leaders who felt we would benefit personally,
professionally, and, most important, pedagogically
through exposure to the hacker community. I have
now attended 11 and presented at three. With each
attendance, my colleagues and I have come away
with a greater understanding of the diversity within
the computer science culture, the emerging fault
lines in the security boundaries of our systems, and
an appreciation for the extreme technical expertise,
problem solving, and focus that is often marginalized
by the mainstream computer science community. 
The hackers are largely self- and peer-taught. But
do not assume that just because no computer sci-
ence diplomas hang on their walls (though many
do) they are not worth engaging. In many ways
their expertise and problem solving exceeds their
counterparts in our research laboratories and class-
rooms. Comments like “I was accepted at MIT but
didn’t have the money to attend” and backgrounds

Why Computer Scientists Should
Attend Hacker Conferences
Along with the intellectual challenge, scientists may appreciate the technical insight,
especially about security, ethical honesty, and common computing interests.

like “when I was a Navy SEAL” are likely to be 
the norm rather than the exception. Gender, 
ethnic background, and age are profoundly irrele-
vant in a diverse meritocracy that glorifies what you
demonstrably know. They color outside the lines,
unlike many of us who have been trained to color
inside them.
Make no mistake; your first attendance is likely to
be uncomfortable. You’re unlikely to be instantly rec-
ognized as an authority in the field. Instead you will
be judged on your attitude, intelligence, creativity,
and the content of your conversation. If you present
your work (formally or informally) you may find
you get a more intense and intellectually honest
review than you would from your local research
group members or academic peers. 
This review can be profoundly beneficial. At a
recent Interz0ne conference, I gave a talk on the
notion of using information visualization techniques
to detect network attacks. Attendees were helpful;
one pointed out the subtle similarity between two
images and postulated that the attack the tools were
visualizing came from the same code base, opening
up an entirely new avenue of research. Another
noted that a visualization technique under discussion
was reminiscent of the Incan quipu. After returning
home and looking up the definition of quipu, I
found he was right, so I’ve now incorporated ancient
communication techniques as inspiration for my
current research. 
A third attendee wrote a favorable review of my
talk and posted it to the broadly disseminated
memestreams system (www.memestreams.net). Traf-
fic to my research Web site jumped dramatically.
During a related discussion, a fourth clearly
explained a novel application of Fourier transforms
to my work. I am indebted to these people for the
help they freely provided. I would argue that engag-
ing the community in this bidirectional manner
would deliver similar rewards.
Far beyond these anecdotal examples, I’ve been
profoundly and positively influenced by my interac-
tion with the hacker community. First and foremost,
true hackers are not the enemy. One respected
hacker explained it as this: “If a group is treated as
the enemy, they will behave like one, but if they are
treated as peers and experts who have something to
contribute they will rise to the challenge.” 
Hacker conferences have taught me respect for
interdisciplinary backgrounds and diversity within the
computing disciplines. Hackers’ passionate pursuit of
technical excellence and lifetime learning, as well as
their adventuresome exploration and enjoyment of
technology, are to be emulated. I’ve now altered my
teaching philosophy to aim to instill these attributes in
my students. I now expect them to approach prob-
lems from many perspectives, not just search for what
they view as the approved solution. I aim to do the
same in my own research. In addition, with each con-
ference attendance I return to the classroom with a
fresh set of experiences, ethical case studies, possible
guest speakers, anecdotes, and software tools to breathe
life and relevance into the classroom experience.
As you begin to explore hacker conferences,
remember, too, that you are likely stepping into a
different social circle. If you treat the culture with
respect, rather than writing off people different from
yourself, you are also likely to find a great deal of
common interest. 
We may take different paths through life, have
different motivations, play better with certain
groups, or have different ethical compass orienta-
tions. But there is a common thread—a passion for
technology and an intense interest in how things
work. You would do well to attend; both communi-
ties have much to learn from one another. Oh, and
dress casually; sport coat and tie are definitely not
required.
