from the failure of a key supplier. Other 
threats to the supply chain that result in 
economic risks include vulnerabilities to cost 
volatility, reliance on single-source suppliers, 
the cost to swap out suspect vendors, and 
resource constraints due to company size. 62 
Systemic 
Supply Disruptions 
Production short-falls in 
rare earth metals lead to 
supply shortages for 
critical production 
inputs into semi-
conductors 
A variety of systemic and structural failures 
can cause supply shortage for products and 
product components, especially in cases where 
the source of supply is in a single 
geographical location.  
Environmental:  
Disasters 
Geopolitical or natural 
disaster led to supply 
chain disruption  
The availability of key supply chain inputs is 
subject to disruptions from geopolitical 
upheavals or natural disasters. This is 
especially the case when suppliers share a 
common fourth-party supplier.  
Structural: 
Hardware Failure 
Inadequate capacity

in a cloud platform 
A vendor or supplier service without the 
appropriate capacity controls in place could be 
subject to disruptions in the event of 
unexpected surges in resource demand.

Vulnerabilities  
A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal 
controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source [NIST SP 800-
53, Rev. 5]. Within the C-SCRM context, it is any weakness in the supply chain, provided 
services, system/component design, development, manufacturing, production, shipping and 
receiving, delivery, operation, and component end-of-life that can be exploited by a threat 
source. This definition applies to the services, systems, and components being developed and 
integrated (i.e., within the SDLC) as well as to the supply chain, including any security 
mitigations and techniques, such as identity management or access control systems. 
Vulnerability assumptions made in the Frame step of the FARM process capture the enterprise’s 
long-term assumptions about the their weaknesses that can be exploited or triggered by a threat 
source. These will become further refined and updated to reflect point-in-time variances during 
the Assess step. Enterprises may make long-term supply chain cybersecurity vulnerability 
assumptions about: 
• The entities within the supply chain itself (e.g., individual supplier relationships); 
• The critical services provided through the supply chain that support the enterprise’s 
critical mission and business processes; 
• The products, systems, and components provided through the supply chain and used 
within the SDLC (i.e., being developed and integrated); 
• The development and operational environment that directly impacts the SDLC; and 
• The logistics and delivery environment that transports systems and components (logically 
or physically). 
Vulnerabilities manifest differently across the three levels (i.e., enterprise, mission and business 
process, information system). At Level 1, vulnerabilities present as susceptibilities of the 
enterprise at large due to managerial and operating structures (e.g., policies, governance, 
processes), conditions in the supply chain (e.g., concentration of products or services from a 
single supplier), and characteristics of enterprise processes (e.g., use of a common system across 
critical processes). At Level 2, vulnerabilities are specific to a mission and business process and 
result from its operating structures and conditions, such as reliance on a specific system, 
supplier-provided input, or service to achieve specific mission and business process operating 
objectives. Level 2 vulnerabilities may vary widely across the different mission and business 
processes. Within Level 3, vulnerabilities manifest as deficiencies or weaknesses in a supplied 
product, the SDLC, system security procedures, internal controls, system implementations,

system inputs, or services provided through the supply chain (e.g., system components or 
services).  
Enterprises should identify approaches to characterizing supply chain cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities that are consistent with the characterization of threat sources and events and with 
the overall approach employed by the enterprise for characterizing vulnerabilities. 
Vulnerabilities may be relevant to a single threat source or broadly applicable across threat 
sources (adversarial, structural, environmental, accidental). For example, a single point of failure 
in a network may be subject to disruptions caused by environmental threats (e.g., disasters) or 
adversarial threats (terrorists). Appendix B provides examples of supply chain cybersecurity 
threats, based on [NIST SP 800-30, Rev. 1, Appendix B].  
All three levels should contribute to determining the enterprise’s approach to characterizing 
vulnerabilities with progressively more detail identified and documented in the lower levels. 
Table G-3 provides examples of considerations and different methods for characterizing supply 
chain cybersecurity vulnerabilities at different levels.

relationships (e.g., system 
integrators, COTS, 
external services) 
• Geographical 
considerations related to 
the extent of the 
enterprise’s supply chain  
• Enterprise and Security 
Architecture 
• Criticality 
• Examine agency cybersecurity supply chain 
information, including supply chain maps, to 
identify especially vulnerable entities, 
locations, or enterprises. 
• Analyze the agency mission for susceptibility 
to potential supply chain cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities. 
• Examine third-party provider and supplier 
relationships and interdependencies for 
susceptibility to potential supply chain 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 
• Review enterprise architecture and criticality 
to identify areas of weakness that require 
more robust cybersecurity supply chain 
considerations. 
Level 2 
• Mission and business 
processes 
• Geographic locations 
• Mission and process level

specific mission and business processes and 
applicable threat and supply chain 
information.

• If appropriate, use the National Vulnerability 
Database (NVD) – including Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and 
Common Vulnerability Scoring System 
(CVSS) – to characterize, categorize, and 
score vulnerabilities63 or other acceptable 
methodologies.  
• Consider using scoring guidance to prioritize 
vulnerabilities for remediation. 
Level 3 
• Individual technologies, 
solutions, and services  
• Supply chain SDLC 
inputs, such as system 
components or services 
• Refine analysis based on inputs from related 
Level 2 missions and business processes. 
• Use CVEs where available to characterize 
and categorize vulnerabilities. 
• Identify weaknesses.  
Impact and Harm 
Impact is the effect on enterprise operations, enterprise assets, individuals, other enterprises, or 
the Nation (including the national security interests of the United States) of a loss of 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or an information system [NIST SP 800-
53, Rev. 5]. Impact estimated within the Frame step represents the enterprise’s long-term 
assumptions about the effects that different cybersecurity events may have on its primary 
processes. These assumptions are updated and refined as part of the Assess step to ensure that 
point-in-time relevant information (e.g., market conditions) that may alter the impact’s scope, 
duration, or magnitude is appropriately reflected in the analysis.  
When possible, enterprises should inherit assumptions made by the enterprise on consequences 
and impact as part of enterprise risk management activities. For example, one of these activities 
is performing a business impact analysis (BIA) to determine or revalidate mission-critical and 
mission-enabling processes as part of the enterprise’s continuity and emergency preparedness 
responsibilities. However, these assumptions may need to be developed if they do not yet exist. 
Enterprises may maintain impact or harm libraries that capture the enterprise’s standing 
assumptions about the impact or harm of different cybersecurity event types (e.g., disclosure, 
disruption, destruction, modification) on the enterprise’s assets. These libraries may break down 
impact and harm into individual impact types (e.g., operational, environmental, individual safety, 
reputational, regulatory/legal fines and penalties, IT recovery/replacement, direct financial 
damage to critical infrastructure sector).

For C-SCRM, enterprises should refine and update their consequences and impact assumptions 
to reflect the role that the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of supplier-provided products 
or services have on the enterprise’s operations, assets, and individuals. For example, depending 
on its criticality, the loss of a key supplier-provided input or service may reduce the enterprise’s 
operational capacity or completely inhibit its operations. In this publication, impact or harm is in 
relation to the enterprise’s primary objectives and arises from products or services traversing the 
supply chain or the supply chain itself.  
C-SCRM consequences and impact will manifest differently across all three levels in the risk 
management hierarchy. Impact determinations require a combined top-down and bottom-up 
approach. Table G-4 provides examples of how consequences and impact may be characterized 
at different levels of the enterprise.

Level 
Impact Considerations 
Methods 
Level 1 • General enterprise-level 
impact assumptions 
• Supplier criticality (e.g., 
holistic supplier 
relationships) 
• Examine the magnitude of exposure to 
individual entities within the supply chain. 
• Refine Level 2 analysis to determine 
aggregate Level 1 impacts on the enterprise’s 
primary function resulting from 
cybersecurity events to and through the 
supply chain. 
Level 2 • Process role in enterprise’s 
primary function 
• Supplier criticality to 
mission/process (inputs and 
services)  
For each type of cybersecurity event: 
• Refine Level 3 analysis to determine 
aggregate mission and business process 
impacts due to operational-level impacts 
from cybersecurity events to and through the 
supply chain. 
• Examine supplier network to identify 
business/mission-level impacts due to events 
that affect individual supplier entities. 
Level 3 • Criticality of upstream and 
downstream Level 2 
processes 
• System criticality 
• Supplier criticality to 
system operations (system 
components and services) 
• Examine the system’s aggregated criticality 
to Level 1 and Level 2 primary processes.  
• Examine the criticality of supplied system 
components or services to the system’s 
overall function. 
• Examine the supplier network to identify 
individual entities that may disrupt the 
availability of critical system inputs or 
services.

Enterprises should look to several sources for information that helps contextualize consequences 
and impact. Historical data is preferential and can be gathered by reviewing historical data for 
the agency, similar peer enterprises, supplier organizations, or applicable industry surveys. 
Where gaps in historical data exist, enterprises should consider the use of expert elicitation 
protocols (e.g., calibrated estimation training), which make use of the tacit knowledge of 
appropriate individuals across the enterprise. By interviewing well-positioned experts (e.g., 
technology or mission and business owners of assets), enterprises can tailor impact assumptions 
to reflect the enterprise’s unique conditions and dependencies. [NISTIR 8286] offers a more in-
depth discussion of how different quantitative and qualitative methodologies can be used to 
analyze risk.  
The following are examples of cybersecurity supply chain consequences and impacts:  
• An earthquake in Malaysia reduces the amount of commodity dynamic random-access 
memory (DRAM) to 60 % of the world’s supply, creating a shortage for hardware 
maintenance and new design.  
• The accidental procurement of a counterfeit part results in premature component failure, 
thereby impacting the enterprise’s mission performance.  
•
