User: I was just wondering what network libraries there are out there for Python for building a TCP/IP server. I know that Twisted might jump to mind but the documentation seems scarce, sloppy, and scattered to me. 
Also, would using Twisted even have a benefit over rolling my own server with select.select()?
Assistant: Just adding an answer to re-iterate other posters - it'll be worth it to use Twisted. There's no reason to write yet another TCP server that'll end up working not as well as one using twisted would. The only reason would be if writing your own is much faster, developer-wise, but if you just bite the bullet and learn twisted now, your future projects will benefit greatly. And, as others have said, you'll be able to do much more complex stuff if you use twisted from the start.
