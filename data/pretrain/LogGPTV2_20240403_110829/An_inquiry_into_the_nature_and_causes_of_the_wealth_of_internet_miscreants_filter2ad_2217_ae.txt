# Analysis of Ads for Goods in Labeled Data

## 4.1 Goods

### 4.1.1 Measurement Methodology

Among the most common goods sold in the market are online credentials such as bank logins and PayPal accounts, sensitive data like credit card information and Social Security Numbers (SSNs), compromised machines, spamming tools (including mailing lists and open mail relays), and scam webpages used for phishing.

### 4.1.2 Measurement Results

Figure 12 illustrates the distribution of ads for goods from the labeled dataset. Sales ads outnumber want ads by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.

## 4.1.3 Hacking-Related Goods

### 4.1.3.1 Measurement Methodology

Hacking-related ads include hacked hosts, root accounts, compromised e-merchant accounts, and software exploits. The most common hacking-related ads are those for compromised hosts. Sales ads for hacked hosts and root accounts constitute 5.39% of the labeled data, while want ads for these items make up 1.85%.

To determine the accuracy of these percentages as estimators for the entire corpus, we trained two binary text classifiers: one for identifying want ads and another for sales ads for compromised hosts. These classifiers were trained using positive and negative examples from the training set. We evaluated their performance on the remaining 30% of the labeled data in the test set, reporting both precision and recall. Precision is calculated as the number of correct positives divided by the total number of predicted positives, and recall is the number of correct positives divided by the total number of actual positives.

We set the positive error penalization to 3 and 8, respectively, to ensure that training errors on positive examples outweigh those on negative examples. This was necessary to prevent the classifier from achieving high accuracy by always labeling messages as negative, thus erring only on the relatively infrequent positive examples.

The compromised host sales ad classifier achieved a precision of 68.4% and a recall of 42.6%. The compromised host want ad classifier achieved a precision of 57.1% and a recall of 38.1%. We chose classifiers with higher precision and lower recall to limit the number of false positives. Higher recall percentages are possible with lower precision, but this would increase the number of predicted positives. Despite their less than perfect classification accuracy, these classifiers efficiently filter the corpus and reduce the work required for subsequent analysis.

### 4.1.3.2 Measurement Results

We used the resulting text classifiers to label 13 million unlabeled messages as either want ads or sales ads for compromised hosts, or neither. We scaled the measurements derived from the labeled output by the precision/recall ratio to roughly estimate the true positives in the corpus, assuming that errors are uniformly distributed over the dataset and that the error rates on the test set carry over to the entire corpus.

Figure 13(a) shows the results of the want ad classifier, and Figure 13(b) shows the results of the sales ad classifier. The sales ad classifier identified an extrapolated 4.8% of the total corpus as sales ads for compromised hosts, with an absolute error of 0.59% from the previous estimate. The want ad classifier identified an extrapolated 2.6% of the total corpus as want ads for compromised hosts, with an absolute error of 0.75% from the previous estimate.

## 4.1.4 Spam and Phishing-Related Goods

### 4.1.4.1 Measurement Results

As shown in Figure 12, the majority of spam and phishing-related ads in the labeled dataset are sales ads offering bulk email lists and URLs of web email forms vulnerable to "email injection attacks." An email injection attack exploits the input validation of web email forms, such as the ubiquitous contact us form, to include additional recipient email addresses. Instead of being sent to the individual responsible for the contact form, the web server sends the message to a list of injected addresses. The ease with which vulnerable email forms can be found has produced a bustling trade of such mailers. Mailer sales ads are the fourth most common type of ad for all goods, with bulk email list sales ads as the seventh most common.

Vulnerable mailers simplify the job of spammers who might otherwise have to locate open mail relays or employ bots to send spam. Email lists created by crawling web pages with email spiders or extracted from customer databases of compromised e-merchants further facilitate targeted spam campaigns.

## 4.1.5 Online Credentials and Sensitive Data

### 4.1.5.1 Measurement Results

A significant number of ads for online credentials, including bank account logins and PayPal accounts, were identified in the labeled data (see Figure 12). Additionally, want and sale ads for credit cards with associated information (CVV2, name, address, and answers to challenge questions) were common. Value-added features associated with credit card data include the freshness of the data and completeness of the associated information. Credit cards with CVV2 validation codes and full owner information, recently acquired (fresh), command a premium. Such cards are more flexible than cards with limited owner information or without their associated validation codes.
