List all user accounts: Use the `cat /etc/passwd` command, for example: `cat /etc/passwd`. 6. Find a specific user account: Use the `grep` command, for example: `grep "username" /etc/passwd`. 7. Switch to another user account: Use the `su` command, for example: `su username`. 8. List the groups the current user belongs to: use the `groups` command, for example: `groups`. 9.
