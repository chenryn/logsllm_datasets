User: I have a python script that looks files up in a relative directory. For example: the python script is in /home/username/projectname/. I have a file that is being called within the python script that is in /home/username/projectname/subfolder.
If I run the script from the shell as python scriptname.py it runs perfectly fine.
However, i'm trying to run the script as a startup service. I'm setting it up in webmin, and I believe its using a terminal command to call it. In the startup command, I'm doing something like this to call the script:
execute python home/username/projectname/scriptname.py.  The script is starting up fine, but I get an error because it cant access the files in the relative directory.
I am guessing that there is a better way to call the python program from within the startup command so that its aware of the relative path.
Assistant: The process that starts your python script (probably forkink) has a pwd (its working directory). The idea is to change the pwd of the process before to fork and execute python.
You need to look over the manual of the process that executes the shell command, and see how to set the pwd.(in shell you use cd or pushd)
