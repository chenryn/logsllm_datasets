### Optimized Text

**Route Preference:**
A secure route is chosen only if no shorter or less-costly insecure route is available. The survey confirms that the third security model, which prioritizes security after cost and length, is the most popular in partial deployments [18].

**Robustness Analysis:**
In Appendix K, we analyze the robustness of our results to the assumptions made in these models.

**Threat Model and Metric:**
Sections 3-4.1 introduce our threat model and a metric to quantify security within this model. Our metric measures the average fraction of Autonomous Systems (ASes) using a legitimate route when a destination is under attack.

**Deployment Invariants:**
The vast number of choices for the set \( S \) of ASes that adopt S*BGP makes evaluating security challenging. Section 4 presents our most novel methodological contribution: a framework that bounds the maximum possible security improvements for any deployment scenario \( S \).

**Deployment Scenarios:**
How close do real S*BGP deployments \( S \) come to these bounds? While determining the "optimal" deployment \( S \) would be ideal, we prove that this is NP-hard. Instead, Sections 5-6 use simulations on empirical AS-level graphs to quantify security in scenarios suggested in the literature [6, 11, 19, 44] and determine the root causes for security improvements (or lack thereof).

**Algorithms and Experimental Robustness:**
We designed parallel simulation algorithms to handle the large parameter space, including attackers, destinations, deployment scenarios \( S \), and routing policies (Appendix B and H). We also controlled for empirical pitfalls such as variations in routing policies (Appendix K), the fact that empirical AS-level graphs often miss many peering links at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) [3, 5, 45] (Section 2.2, Appendix J), and the observation that a large fraction of the Internet's traffic originates from a few ASes [31] (Sections 2.2, 4.5, 5.2.2, 5.3.1).

While our analysis cannot predict exactly how individual ASes will react to routing attacks, we report strong aggregate trends.

**Proofs:**
Proofs of our theorems are provided in Appendices B-I.

**Results:**

1. **Downgrade Attacks:**
   Protocol downgrade attacks (Sections 1.1, 3.2) can be extremely effective, rendering S*BGP deployments at large Tier 1 ISPs almost useless in the face of attacks (Sections 4.6 and 5.3.1).

2. **New Vulnerabilities:**
   The interplay between topology and routing policies can cause some ASes to fall victim to attacks they would have avoided without S*BGP. Fortunately, these troubling phenomena occur less frequently than those that protect ASes during partial deployment (Section 6).

3. **New Instabilities:**
   Undesirable phenomena, such as BGP Wedgies [23], can occur if ASes prioritize security inconsistently (Section 2.3).

4. **Prescriptive Deployment Guidelines:**
   - ASes should prioritize security consistently to avoid routing instabilities.
   - Deploying lightweight simplex S*BGP [19, 33] at stub ASes at the edge of the Internet does not harm security (Section 5.3.2).
   - While [6, 11, 19] suggest that Tier 1s should be early adopters of S*BGP, our results indicate that Tier 2 ISPs should be among the earliest adopters (Sections 4.6, 5.2.3, 5.3.1).

5. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
   Using our metric, we compare S*BGP in a partial deployment \( S \) to the baseline scenario where no AS is secure (i.e., \( S = \emptyset \) and only origin authentication is in place). We find that large partial deployments of S*BGP provide excellent protection against attacks when ASes prioritize security first (Section 5.2.3). However, [18] suggests that network operators are less likely to use these policies. The policies that operators favor (security third) provide only marginal improvements over origin authentication (Section 4.4). This is not surprising, as S*BGP is designed to prevent path-shortening attacks.
