preferred only if no less-costly insecure route is available.
The survey conﬁrms that our security 3rd model
is most
popular in partial deployment [18]; here a secure route is
preferred only if there is no shorter or less-costly insecure
route.
In Appendix K we analyze the robustness of our
results to assumptions made in these models.
Threat model & metric.
Sections 3-4.1 introduce our
threat model, and a metric to quantify security within this
threat model; our metric measures the average fraction of
ASes using a legitimate route when a destination is attacked.
Deployment invariants. The vast number of choices for
the set S of ASes that adopt S*BGP makes evaluating secu-
rity challenging. Section 4 therefore presents our (arguably)
most novel methodological contribution; a framework that
bounds the maximum improvements in security possible for
each routing model, for any deployment scenario S.
Deployment scenarios. How close do real S*BGP de-
ployments S come to these bounds? While a natural objec-
tive would be to determine the “optimal” deployment S, we
prove that this is NP-hard. Instead, Sections 5-6 use simu-
lations on empirical AS-level graphs to quantify security in
scenarios suggested in the literature [6,11,19,44], and deter-
mine root causes for security improvements (or lack thereof).
Algorithms & experimental robustness.
We de-
signed parallel simulation algorithms to deal with the large
space of parameters that we explore, i.e., attackers, desti-
nations, deployment scenarios S, and routing policies, (Ap-
pendix B and H). We also controlled for empirical pitfalls,
including (a) variations in routing policies (Appendix K) (b)
the fact that empirical AS-level graphs tend to miss many

col because it “breaks” their networks; witness the zone enu-
meration issue in DNSSEC [32] or the fact that IPv6 is some-
times disabled because it degrades DNS performance [50].
peering links at Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) [3, 5, 45],
(Section 2.2, Appendix J) (c) a large fraction of the Inter-
net’s traﬃc originates at a few ASes [31] (Sections 2.2, 4.5, 5.2.2, 5.3.1).
While our analysis cannot predict exactly how individual
ASes would react to routing attacks, we do report on strong
aggregate trends.
Proofs. Proofs of our theorems are in Appendix B-I.
1.3 Results.
Our simulations, empirically-validated examples, and the-
oretical analyses indicate the following:
Downgrades are a harsh reality. We ﬁnd that proto-
col downgrade attacks (Sections 1.1, 3.2) can be extremely
eﬀective; so eﬀective, in fact, that they render deployments
of S*BGP at large Tier 1 ISPs almost useless in the face of
attacks (Sections 4.6 and 5.3.1).
New vulnerabilities.
We ﬁnd that the interplay be-
tween topology and routing policies can cause some ASes
to fall victim to attacks they would have avoided if S*BGP
had not been deployed. Fortunately, these troubling phe-
nomena occur less frequently than phenomena that protect
ASes from attacks during partial deployment (Section 6).
New instabilities. We show that undesirable phenomena
(BGP Wedgies [23]) can occur if ASes prioritize security
inconsistently (Section 2.3).
Prescriptive deployment guidelines. Other than sug-
gesting that (1) ASes should prioritize security in the same
way in order to avoid routing instabilities, our results (2)
conﬁrm that deploying lightweight simplex S*BGP [19, 33]
(instead of full-ﬂedged S*BGP) at stub ASes at the edge of
the Internet does not harm security (Section 5.3.2). More-
over, while [6, 11, 19] suggest that Tier 1s should be early
adopters of S*BGP, our results do not support this; instead,
we suggest that (3) Tier 2 ISPs should be among the earliest
adopters of S*BGP (Section 4.6, 5.2.3, 5.3.1).
Is the juice worth the squeeze? We use our met-
ric to compare S*BGP in a partial deployment S to the
baseline scenario where no AS is secure (i.e., S = ∅ and
only origin authentication is in place). We ﬁnd that large
partial deployments of S*BGP provide excellent protection
against attacks when ASes use routing policies that priori-
tize security 1st (Section 5.2.3); however, [18] suggests that
network operators are less likely to use these routing poli-
cies. Meanwhile, the policies that operators most favor (i.e.,
security 3rd) provide only meagre improvements over origin
authentication (Section 4.4). This is not very surprising,
since S*BGP is designed to prevent path-shortening attacks
