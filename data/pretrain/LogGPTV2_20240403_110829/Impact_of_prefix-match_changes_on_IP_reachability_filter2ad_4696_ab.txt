dress ranges. The node of the binary tree contains left-most
address in the address range, and each node keeps pointer to
the size of the address range and the associated preﬁx set.
Each element of the preﬁx set includes a pointer to the BGP
route for that preﬁx; to save memory, we store a single copy
of each BGP route. As illustrated in Figure 2, both address
ranges [12.0.0.0, 12.0.0.255] and [12.0.1.0, 12.0.255.255] have
preﬁx 12.0.0.0/16 in the preﬁx set, and their preﬁx sets store
the pointers to the route entry for 12.0.0.0/16. Note that in
the ﬁgure, we only plot the pointers from the most-speciﬁc
preﬁxes to the routing table for illustration.
3.2 Tracking Changes to Address Ranges
Next, we present an online algorithm that reads BGP
table dumps or update messages as input, and tracks the
changes to the address ranges and their associated preﬁx
sets. The algorithm ﬁrst determines the address range(s)
covered by the preﬁx, perhaps creating new address ranges
or subdividing existing ones. Then, for each of the associ-
ated address ranges, the algorithm modiﬁes the preﬁx set as
needed.
Updating address ranges: A BGP announcement for a
new preﬁx may require creating new address ranges or sub-
dividing existing ones. For example, suppose 18.0.0.0/16 is
announced for the ﬁrst time, and no earlier announcements
covered any part of the 18.0.0.0/16 address space; then, our
algorithm inserts a new address range [18.0.0.0,18.0.255.255],
with a preﬁx set of {/16},
into the binary tree. As an-
other example, suppose we have previously seen route an-
nouncements only for 12.0.0.0/8 and 12.0.0.0/16; then, the
binary tree would contain [12.0.0.0,12.0.255.255] with pre-
ﬁx set {/8, /16}, and [12.1.0.0,12.255.255.255] with preﬁx
set {/8}. On processing an announcement for 12.0.0.0/24,
into
our algorithm would subdivide [12.0.0.0,12.0.255.255]
two address ranges—one with preﬁx set {/8, /16, /24} and
another with {/8, /16}, as shown in Figure 2. Currently,
our algorithm does not delete or merge address ranges after
withdrawal messages. We take this lazy approach towards
deleting and merging address ranges because withdrawn pre-
ﬁxes are often announced again later, and because we have
seen empirically that the number of address ranges increases
very slowly over time.
Updating preﬁx set for address ranges: Continu-
ing with the example in Figure 2, suppose the route for
12.0.0.0/16 is withdrawn. Then, the algorithm would deter-
mine that both [12.0.0.0-12.0.0.255] and [12.0.1.0,12.0.255.255]
have /16 removed from the preﬁx set. For addresses in
[12.0.1.0-12.0.255.255], the withdrawal would change the longest
matching preﬁx to the less speciﬁc 12.0.0.0/8.
4. DYNAMICS OF PREFIX-MATCH CHANGES
In this section, we apply our algorithm to BGP update
messages collected for the month of February 2009 from a
top-level route reﬂector in a tier-1 ISP backbone. We ﬁrst
determine the frequency of the BGP updates which aﬀect
the longest-matching preﬁx for IP address ranges. Then, we
study four main categories of preﬁx-match changes, based on
the origin ASes (i.e., the AS that introduces the preﬁx into
BGP) of the two preﬁxes and how often the more-speciﬁc
preﬁx is available. Finally, we present a preliminary analysis
of Netﬂow data to understand the impact of preﬁx-match
changes on end-to-end reachability.
4.1 Frequency of Preﬁx-Match Changes
The BGP update messages from the top-level route re-
ﬂector give us a view of BGP routing changes seen at a
large Point-of-Presence (PoP) in the ISP backbone. Our
algorithm starts by reading a BGP table dump taken at
the beginning of the month, followed by the stream of BGP
update messages. We ﬁlter duplicate update messages, in-
cluding those sent after resets of our monitoring session [1]
to the route reﬂector. We also ﬁlter updates caused by route
ﬂapping, where a preﬁx is repeatedly announced and with-
drawn for a long period of time. As in previous work [2], we
group update messages for the same preﬁx that occur with
an interarrival time of less than 70 seconds, assuming these
updates are part of the same BGP convergence event. Since
most convergence events last less than ﬁve minutes [2], we
assume longer events correspond to persistent ﬂapping, and
remove these ﬂapping updates from further analysis. This
ﬁltered 25,120 BGP updates caused by route ﬂapping, which
account for 0.21% of the total number of BGP updates in
that month.
We ﬁnd four main categories of BGP update messages, as
summarized in Table 2:
Updating a route for an existing preﬁx: Just under
70% of the update messages are announcements that merely
change the route for an existing IP preﬁx, as indicated by
the ﬁrst row of the table. These update do not aﬀect the
longest-matching preﬁx used for forwarding data packets.

Table 2: Classiﬁcation of BGP update messages
Gaining or losing reachability: Another 14.8% of mes-
sages either add or remove the only preﬁx that covers some
range of IP addresses. Half are withdrawal messages that
leave these addresses with no matching preﬁx, and the other
half are announcements that allow these addresses to go back
to having a matching preﬁx.
Changing the longest-matching preﬁx: Another 13.0%
of messages cause some addresses to change to a diﬀerent
longest-matching preﬁx. Half are withdrawal messages that
force these addresses to match a less-speciﬁc preﬁx, and the
other half are announcements that allow these addresses to
match a more-speciﬁc preﬁx.
Aﬀecting a preﬁx that is not used for forward-
ing: The remaining 2.5% of update messages either add
or remove a preﬁx that is not the longest-matching preﬁx
for any IP addresses1. These preﬁxes are supernets like
12.0.0.0/8 that correspond to an address space that is com-
pletely covered by more-speciﬁc preﬁxes like 12.0.0.0/9 and
12.128.0.0/9.
Analysis of BGP update messages for a diﬀerent time pe-
riod (namely, March 2009) led to very similar results. In the
rest of this section, we focus on the 13.0% of BGP update
messages that cause preﬁx-match changes.
4.2 Characterization of Preﬁx Match Changes
To analyze the preﬁx-match changes, we also account for
the eﬀects of route ﬂapping, and ﬁltered 25,120 BGP up-
dates (0.21% of the total BGP updates in February 2009)
caused by route ﬂapping, and left us with 1,278,552 preﬁx-
match changes for the month of February 2009 for further
analysis.
Looking at the remaining measurement data, we notice
that most addresses ranges have a single preﬁx that serves
as the longest-matching preﬁx the vast majority of the time.
In fact, 95.2% of the address ranges have a preﬁx they use
more than 90% of the time, and 98.7% have a preﬁx they
use more than 60% of the time. We apply a threshold of
60% to identify the dominant preﬁx for each address range,
and analyze the preﬁx-match changes that cause an address
range to stop using its dominant preﬁx. This leaves us with
688,914 preﬁx-match changes to analyze (which is 53.9% of
the total preﬁx-match changes). For some address ranges,
these events involve the brief announcement (and subsequent
withdrawal) of a more-speciﬁc preﬁx; for others, these events
involve the brief withdrawal of the dominant preﬁx and the

than
withdrawals—a seemingly odd phenomenon we intend to in-
vestigate further. We suspect that, over time, some ASes
introduce additional supernet routes as part of conﬁguring
backup routes.
temporary use of a less-speciﬁc route. As such, we clas-
sify preﬁx-match changes in terms of whether the dominant
route is more-speciﬁc or less-speciﬁc than the other (brieﬂy
used) preﬁx. To understand the possible reasons for the
preﬁx-match changes, we also compare the origin ASes of
the old and new preﬁxes. This leaves us with four cases,
as summarized in Table 3. Note that the more-specifc and
less-speciﬁc preﬁx match mentioned in the table are for the
brieﬂy used preﬁxes.
Same origin AS, more-speciﬁc preﬁx: About 13.6%
of the preﬁx-match changes involve a brief announcement of
a more-speciﬁc preﬁx with the same origin AS as the domi-
nant preﬁx. We suspect that these preﬁx-match changes are
caused by temporary route leaks, where the more-speciﬁc
preﬁx is announced inadvertently due to a conﬁguration mis-
take that is ﬁxed relatively quickly (e.g., within a few hours
or at most a day or two).
Same origin AS, less-speciﬁc preﬁx: About 58.4%
of the preﬁx-match changes involve a brief withdrawal of
the dominant preﬁx that leads to the temporary use of a
less-speciﬁc route with the same origin AS. We suspect that
these preﬁx-match changes are caused by multi-homed ASes
that announce both preﬁxes for a ﬁne-grained load balanc-
ing. For example, a multi-homed stub AS connected to two
providers may announce 15.0.0.0/17 to one provider and
15.0.128.0/17 to the other, and the supernet 15.0.0.0/16 to
both. The more-speciﬁc 15.0.0.0/17 preﬁx would be with-
drawn whenever the link to the ﬁrst provider fails, and the
less-speciﬁc 15.0.0.0/16 would remain because the route is
also announced via the second provider.
Diﬀerent origin ASes, more-speciﬁc preﬁx: Only
2.9% of the preﬁx-match changes involve a brief announce-
ment of a more-speciﬁc preﬁx from a diﬀerent origin AS. We
suspect some of these announcements correspond to “sub-
preﬁx hijacking” caused by a conﬁguration mistake or a ma-
licious attack. For example, during the infamous hijacking
of YouTube in February 2008 [3], Pakistan Telecom mis-
takenly announced 208.65.153.0/24, a subnet of YouTube’s
208.65.152.0/22 address block. Another cause could be an
ISP that inadvertently misconﬁgures a route ﬁlter that is
supposed to block small address blocks announced by one of
its customer ASes.
Diﬀerent origin ASes, less-speciﬁc preﬁx: About
25.1% of the preﬁx-match changes involve a brief withdrawal
of the dominant preﬁx that leads to the temporary use of a
less-speciﬁc route with a diﬀerent origin AS. We suspect that
these preﬁx-match changes occur when a customer AS fails,
but its provider does not. For example, suppose a provider
that announces 12.0.0.0/8 has allocated 12.1.1.0/24 to one
of its customers. If the customer fails, the customer’s route
for 12.1.1.0/24 is withdrawn, while the provider’s 12.0.0.0/8
route remains.
In our ongoing work, we are analyzing these four cases in
greater detail, to understand the causes of the preﬁx-match
changes and the resulting impact on end-to-end reachabil-
ity.
4.3 Joint Analysis with Trafﬁc Data
In this subsection, we present a joint analysis with the
traﬃc data from the same router to understand the eﬀects
of preﬁx-match changes on end-to-end reachability.
In practice, active and passive measurements are two ap-
proaches to infer data-plane reachability. With active mea-

Table 3: Four classes of preﬁx-match events and their possible causes
surement, tools like ping and traceroute generate ICMP
packets for the destination host or routers along the path
to respond. However, active measurement tools can not ac-
curately infer IP reachability, because: (i) ICMP packets
may be ﬁltered by middle boxes such as NAT and ﬁrewalls
and (ii) many routers do not generate ICMP responses, or
rate-limit the responses. Finally, active measurement of-
ten imposes heavy measurement overhead by sending many
ICMP packets to monitor blocks of IP addresses over short
time intervals. Instead, we use the passive measurement of
IP ﬂows, which are sampled and collected as Netﬂow records,
for our analysis of end-to-end reachability.
In this analysis, our aim is to ﬁnd counterexamples to
the conventional understanding of reachability changes: (i)
when a preﬁx is withdrawn, the IP addresses it covers be-
come unreachable and (ii) if a preﬁx has a BGP route in
the routing table, then the covered IP addresses are reach-
able. To counter the ﬁrst conventional wisdom, we show that
even if a preﬁx is withdrawn, the IP addresses could still be
reachable via a less-speciﬁc preﬁx, corresponding to the sec-
ond row in Table 3. For the second conventional wisdom, we
illustrate that even when the routing table contains a route
to a preﬁx, the IP addresses covered by this preﬁx might not
be reachable, especially if the route is a less-speciﬁc preﬁx
of the network provider.
To perform our analysis, we consider the preﬁx-match
changes given in Table 3. For each change, we compute
traﬃc volume from all the Netﬂow records of the aﬀected
address ranges in ﬁve minute bins around the time of the
preﬁx-match change. This allows us to understand the im-
pact of the preﬁx-match change on reachability. Our expec-
tation is that if an address range becomes unreachable, the
traﬃc volume would drop to a very low level. While a com-
prehensive analysis is part of ongoing work, we here present
two examples that allow us to counter the two conventional
wisdoms mentioned above.
The Netﬂow records are collected at the incoming inter-
faces at most of the core routers in the tier-1 ISP. In or-
der to make sure that the traﬃc changes are caused by the
routing changes, we selectively use the Netﬂow records for
traﬃc that leaves the ISP at the same PoP where we col-
lected the BGP routing updates. We used Netﬂow records
from February 18-27, 2009 for the joint analysis. There are
two stages of sampling during the collection of the Netﬂow
records: packet sampling at the rate of 1/500 and smart
sampling at the threshold of 80,000,000 bytes [4]. Because
of both stages of sampling, correction has to be done to
estimate the actual number of bytes or packets.
Figure 3 shows the traﬃc volume for an address range
that changes to a less-speciﬁc preﬁx with the same origin
AS. Speciﬁcally, the address range changed from a /20 to
/17 preﬁx for about half an hour on February 18, 2009. As
the traﬃc volume curve shows, the destinations in the ad-
