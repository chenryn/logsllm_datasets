3.3. Effect of Read Disturb on Raw Bit Error Rate
Now that we know how much the threshold voltage shifts
due to read disturb effects, we aim to relate these shifts to the
raw bit error rate (RBER), which refers to the probability of
reading an incorrect state from a ﬂash cell. We see that for a
given amount of P/E cycle wear on a block, the raw bit error
rate increases roughly linearly with the number of read disturb
operations. Fig. 6 shows the RBER over an increasing number
of read disturb operations for different amounts of P/E cycle
wear on ﬂash blocks. Each level shows a linear RBER increase
as the read disturb count increases.

Fig. 6. Raw bit error rate vs. read disturb count under different levels of
P/E cycle wear.
We also observe that the effects of read disturb are greater
for cells that have experienced a larger number of P/E cycles.
In Fig. 6, the derivative (i.e., slope) of each line grows with
the number of P/E cycles at roughly a quadratic rate. This is an
effect of the wear caused with each additional P/E cycle, where
the probability of charge getting trapped within the transistor
oxide increases and the insulating abilities of the dielectric
degrade [26]. As a result, when Vpass is applied to the transistor
gate during a read disturb operation, the degraded dielectric
allows additional electrons to be injected through the tunnel into
the ﬂoating gate. This results in a greater degree of threshold
voltage shift for each read disturb operation.
It is important to note that ﬂash correct-and-refresh mech-
anisms [6, 7, 22, 23, 25, 28] can provide long-term correction
of read disturb errors. These refresh mechanisms periodically
take the contents of a ﬂash block and program them to a
new block,
in effect resetting the impact of retention loss
and read disturbs. However, the refresh frequency is typically
limited, as each refresh operation forces an additional erase
and program operation on a block, thereby increasing wear.
For the purposes of our studies, we assume that refreshes take
place after a retention period of one week (i.e., one week after
programming) [6,7], and thus we focus on the number of read
disturb errors that can occur over the course of seven days.
3.4. Pass-Through Voltage Impact on Read Disturb
As we saw in Sec. 3.2, the effects of read disturb worsen
for cells whose threshold voltages are further from Vpass. In
fact, when we observe the raw bit errors that result from read
disturb, we ﬁnd that the majority of these errors are from cells
that were programmed in the ER state but shift into the P1 state
due to read disturb. We have already discussed that a lower
value of Vth increases the impact of read disturb, assuming a
ﬁxed value of Vpass. In this subsection, we will quantitatively
show how the difference (Vpass − Vth) affects the magnitude
of FN tunneling that takes place, which directly correlates with
(and affects) the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift due
to read disturb.
Fig. 7a shows the internal design of the ﬂoating gate cell
in NAND ﬂash. The ﬂoating gate holds the charge of a ﬂash
cell, which is set to a particular threshold voltage Vth when the
ﬂoating gate is programmed. The control gate is used to read or
reprogram the value held within the ﬂoating gate. The control
gate and ﬂoating gate are separated by an insulator, reoxidized
nitrided SiO2 (ONO), which has an effective capacitance of
Cono and a thickness of tono. Between the ﬂoating gate and the
substrate lies the tunneling oxide, whose effective capacitance
is Cox and whose thickness is tox. The substrate has a constant
intrinsic voltage, which we refer to as Vthi.
When a positive voltage (VG) is applied to the control gate,
two electric ﬁelds are induced: one ﬂowing from the control
gate to the ﬂoating gate (Eono), and another ﬂowing from
the ﬂoating gate to the substrate (Eox). As we mentioned in
Sec. 2.3, the electric ﬁeld Eox through the tunnel oxide is a

We derive Eox by determining the component of the elec-
trical ﬁeld induced due to the voltage differential between the
control gate and the ﬂoating gate, by using the voltage equations
V = Et and Q = V C. During a read disturb operation,
VG = Vpass. As a result, the strength of the electrical ﬁeld
Eox is a linear function of (Vpass − Vth).
Fig. 7b illustrates the relationship between the current
density of the FN tunnel (JF N ) and Eox, which we derive
from Eq. (1). Note that the y-axis is in log scale. The ﬁgure
shows that JF N grows super-linearly with Eox. As Eox is a
linear function of (Vpass − Vth), the key insight is that either a
decrease in Vth or an increase in Vpass results in a super-linear
increase in the current density, i.e., the tunneling effect that
causes read disturb. This relationship demonstrates why voltage
threshold shifts are much worse for cells in the erased state in
Sec. 3.2 than for cells in the other states, as the erased state has a
much higher value of (Vpass−Vth), assuming a ﬁxed Vpass for
all cells. As a higher (Vpass−Vth) increases the impact of read
disturb, we want to reduce this voltage difference. Even a small
decrease in (Vpass−Vth) can signiﬁcantly reduce the tunneling
current density (see Fig. 7b), and hence the read disturb effects.
We use this insight to drive the next several characterizations,
which identify the feasibility and potential of lowering Vpass
to reduce the effects of read disturb.
There are several constraints that restrict
To summarize, we have shown that the cause of read disturb
can be reduced by reducing the pass-through voltage. Our goal
is to exploit this observation to mitigate read disturb effects.
3.5. Constraints on Reducing Pass-Through Voltage
the range of
potential values for Vpass in a ﬂash chip. All of these constraints
must be taken into account if we are to change the Vpass value
to reduce read disturb. Traditionally, a single Vpass value is
used globally for the entire chip, and the value of Vpass must
be higher than all potential threshold voltages within the chip.
Due to the charge leakage that occurs during data retention,
the threshold voltage of each cell slowly decreases over time.
The speciﬁc rate of leakage can vary across ﬂash cells, as a
function of both process variation and uneven wear-leveling. If
we can identify the slowest leaking cell in the entire ﬂash chip,
we may be able to globally decrease Vpass over time to reduce
the effects of read disturb.
To observe whether the slowest
leaks fast
enough to yield any meaningful Vpass reduction, we perform
experiments on a ﬂash block that has incurred 8,000 P/E cycles,
and study the drop in threshold voltage over retention age
(i.e., the length of time for which the data has been stored

in the ﬂash block). Unfortunately, in a 40-day study, there was
no signiﬁcant change in normalized threshold voltage for the
slowest leaking cell, as shown in Fig. 8. This is despite the
fact that the mean threshold voltage for a cell in the P3 state
dropped to 437, which is much lower than the lowest observed
threshold voltage (503) in Fig. 8. (The slowest leaking cell has
a threshold voltage 6σ higher than the mean.)

Fig. 8. Maximum threshold voltage within a block with 8K P/E cycles of
wear vs. retention age, at room temperature.
In order to successfully lower the value of Vpass, we must
turn to a mechanism where Vpass can be set individually for
each ﬂash block. The minimum Vpass value for a block only
needs to be larger than the maximum threshold voltage within
that block. This is affected by two things: different blocks are
likely to have different maximum threshold voltages because
they may have (1) different amounts of P/E cycle wear, or
(2) different levels of Vth due to process variation effects.
Therefore, we conclude that a mechanism that provides a
per-block value of Vpass must be able to adjust this value
dynamically based on the current properties of the block, to
ensure that the Vpass selected for each block is greater than
the maximum Vth in that block.
3.6. Effect of Pass-Through Voltage on Raw Bit
Error Rate
Even when Vpass is selected on a per-block basis, it may
make sense to reduce Vpass to a value below the maximum Vth
within the block, to further reduce the effects of read disturb.
Our goal is to characterize and understand how this reduction
affects the raw bit error rate.
Setting Vpass to a value slightly lower than the maximum
Vth leads to a tradeoff. On the one hand, it can substantially
reduce the effects of read disturb. On the other hand, it causes
a small number of unread cells to incorrectly stay off instead
of passing through a value, potentially leading to a read error.
Therefore, if the number of read disturb errors can be dropped
signiﬁcantly by lowering Vpass, the small number of read errors
introduced may be warranted.5 Naturally, this trade-off depends
on the magnitude of these error rate changes. We now explore
the gains and costs, in terms of overall RBER, for relaxing
Vpass below the maximum threshold voltage of a block.
We ﬁrst describe how relaxing Vpass increases the RBER
as a result of read errors. Fig. 9a demonstrates an example
using a three-wordline ﬂash block. For each cell in Fig. 9a, the
threshold voltage value of the cell is labeled. When we attempt
to read the value stored in the middle wordline, Vpass is applied
to the top and bottom wordlines. Let us assume that we are
performing the ﬁrst step of the read operation, setting the read
reference voltage Vref to Vb (2.5V for this example). The four
cells of our selected wordline turn their transistors off, off, on,
and off, respectively, and we should read the correct data value
0010 from the LSBs. If Vpass is set to 5V (higher than any of
the threshold values of the block), the transistors for our unread
5If too many read errors occur, we can always fall back to using the
maximum threshold voltage for Vpass without consequence; see Sec. 4.4.
