 **Migrated issue, originally created by nyov (@nyov)**
Would it be possible to have a parameter to
`sqlalchemy.sql.expression.select()` to avoid the "Ambiguous column name"
exception for simple joins?  
I don't care for the `use_labels` here as I then have to rewrite all the keys
again after.
If possible, I'd like a parameter to select that would then simply drop the
column name on the right side of the join (where the value is the same for
such a join) from the select column list. As in "select all but
joined_on_column duplicate".
This'd be a nicer, quicker way than writing out all the many column names
manually or working with an alias for a column I still don't need as it's just
a duplicate.
