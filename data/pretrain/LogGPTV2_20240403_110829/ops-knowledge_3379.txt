User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 many_dead_tuples 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks whether the query related table has too many dead tuples, which can cause bloat-table and affect query performance. If the table structure is not available or the insert type is not supported, it is not a root cause. The function then collects information about the dead rate, live tuples, dead tuples, and table size of each table and checks if they exceed certain thresholds. If the dead rate of a table exceeds the dead rate threshold, it is considered a root cause. The function also provides suggestions to clean up dead tuples in time to avoid affecting query performance.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- dead_rate
- live_tuples
- dead_tuples
- table_size
