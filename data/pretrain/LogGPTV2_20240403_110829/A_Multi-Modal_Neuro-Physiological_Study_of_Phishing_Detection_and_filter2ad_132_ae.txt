vices have already been shown vulnerable to privacy attacks where
488a malicious app can infer sensitive user information (e.g., their PIN
digits) based on recorded brain signals [25]. A similar attack model
seems applicable to eye trackers. The attack vector we are envision-
ing aims to infer a user’s neuro-physiological state so as to optimize
the timing of the occurrence of the attack.
explicitly, users are not able to detect the legitimacy of the web-
sites accurately, and therefore the result may be even worse in a
real world attack where the decisions are to be made implicitly.
The subconscious differences in real-fake processing, due to their
implicit nature, may still persist.
Strengths and Limitations: We believe that our study has several
strengths. The neuro-physiological sensors chosen for our study – a
lightweight and wireless EEG headset, and a remote desk mounted
eye-tracker – allowed us to collect data almost transparently just
like in day-to-day computer use. Also, we simulated a near real-
world web browsing experience where participants interacted with
a popular browser and actual websites.
Similar to any other study involving human subjects, our study
also had certain limitations. The study was conducted in a lab,
which might have impacted the performance of participants since
they might not have felt the real security risks, similar to other prior
lab studies. Due to the neuro-physiological focus of the study, it
does not currently seem feasible to conduct such a study online or in
ﬁeld conditions. Although our EEG headset was very lightweight,
performing the tasks with the headset on might have affected the
experience of some participants.
Our participant sample comprised of a majority of young stu-
dents. This represents a common constraint underlying many Uni-
versity lab studies, especially those involving neuro-physiological
scanning due to logistical challenges (e.g., costly equipment, rig-
orous exclusion criteria and lengthy protocols), such as the recent
fMRI study [26] (N=25; mostly students), the eye-tracking study [37]
(N=16; students, faculty and staff) and the eye-tracking study [10]
(N=19; mostly youth). However, our sample exhibited some diver-
sity with respect to educational backgrounds (especially, no partic-
ipant had a computer science background). Moreover, our sample,
especially in terms of age, was closer to the group of users who use
Internet frequently [3] and who are supposedly more vulnerable to
phishing attacks [33]. Also, our result demonstrating subconscious
differences in brain activation while processing real and fake web-
sites may persist despite age differences. Indeed, we saw subcon-
scious differences in the participants belonging to each of the 19-22
age group and 30 plus age group. Future studies might be needed
to further validate our results with broader participant samples.
One limitation of our study pertains to the number of trials pre-
sented to the participants. Although multiple trials is a norm in
EEG (and neuro-imaging) experimental design [24,38] to achieve a
good quality signal-to-noise ratio, the participants may hardly face
many security-related trials in a short span of time in real life. Our
behavioral results, in the malware warnings experiment, are still
well-aligned with a previous large-scale real life study [9].
Another limitation relates to the participants’ motivation to dis-
regard the warning. The reward for ignoring the warning might not
have been high enough for our study participants, since they could
only read full news on disregarding the warning. On the other hand,
since the participants were performing the experiments on a lab
computer, they could have ignored the warning more often when
compared to using their own laptop in real-world. This suggests
that the warning heeding rates may be higher than 85% in a real-
life scenario, which is also reﬂected in the ﬁeld study of [9].
Finally, in the phishing detection task, our participants were ex-
plicitly asked to identify a website as real or fake. However, in a
real-world attack, the victims are driven to a phishing website from
some primary task (e.g., reading email) and the decision about the
legitimacy of the site needs to be made implicitly. Nevertheless, in
any case, the users ultimately have to make the decision about the
legitimacy of the site. Our results show that, despite being asked
10. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We pursued a triangular study of phishing detection and malware
warnings, measuring users’ neural activity, eye gaze patterns, task
performance, and inter-relationships thereof. In the realm of phish-
ing detection, our results showed that users do not spend enough
time looking at key phishing indicators and often fail at detecting
these attacks, although they may be highly engaged in the task and
subconsciously processing real sites differently than fake sites. In
the malware warning tasks, on the other hand, our results demon-
strated that users frequently read and eventually heed the message
embedded within the warning. We also found that a user’s person-
ality traits (speciﬁcally, attention control) directly impact his/her
phishing detection accuracy. This suggests that users may detect
phishing attacks better if they could be trained to exercise attention
control (beyond phishing awareness training). Further work is nec-
essary to understand the effect of such interventional training on
users’ performance in the phishing detection task.
Based on our work, we suggested the possibility of building fu-
ture automated mechanisms applying a fusion of real-time neural
and eye gaze features that can infer users’ “alertness” state, and de-
termine whether or not users’ responses should be relied upon. The
proposed mechanism may be used to “sanitize” a user’s response
and enhance the credibility of human decisions in a user-centered
security system, serving as a closed-loop between humans and ma-
chines. Future research is needed to design and validate such mech-
anisms in different security domains.

APPENDIX
A. SAMPLE WARNING
B. NEURAL METRICS
The B-Alert headset measures and records the electrical activ-
ity in the brain with sensors placed on the scalp. These signals
are ﬁrst decontaminated from any noises, e.g., the presence of eye-
blinks, spikes, and muscle movement. The B-Alert cognitive met-
rics were obtained from ABM’s four-class B-Alert quadratic dis-
criminant function classiﬁcation algorithm (see Berka et al. [29]
and B-Alert User Manual for further details) for each second of
data, referred to as epoch. It gives the mean probability of classi-
ﬁcations for the four classes: high engagement, low engagement,
distraction and sleep in a given epoch. The class with the greatest
mean probability is the winning class. This is the class assigned to
the epoch. For example, if an epoch is classiﬁed as high engage-
ment with probability .45, low engagement as .30, distraction as
.20 and sleep onset as 0.05, then the ﬁnal class of the epoch will be
high engagement. The workload was derived from a two-class Lin-
ear discriminant function algorithm (range 0.0 to 1.0) [11, 12, 29].
