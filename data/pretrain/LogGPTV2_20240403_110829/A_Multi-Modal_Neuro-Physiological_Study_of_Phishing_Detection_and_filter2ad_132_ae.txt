### Vulnerabilities and Attack Vectors

Vice devices have already been shown to be vulnerable to privacy attacks, where a malicious app can infer sensitive user information (e.g., PIN digits) based on recorded brain signals [25]. A similar attack model could be applied to eye trackers. The envisioned attack vector aims to infer a user’s neuro-physiological state to optimize the timing of the attack.

In real-world scenarios, users often fail to accurately detect the legitimacy of websites, leading to even more severe consequences when decisions are made implicitly. Subconscious differences in processing real and fake websites, due to their implicit nature, may persist.

### Strengths and Limitations

#### Strengths
Our study has several strengths. We used lightweight and wireless EEG headsets and a remote desk-mounted eye tracker, allowing us to collect data almost transparently, as if in everyday computer use. Additionally, we simulated a near-real-world web browsing experience where participants interacted with a popular browser and actual websites.

#### Limitations
Similar to other studies involving human subjects, our study had certain limitations. It was conducted in a lab setting, which might have affected participant performance, as they may not have felt the real security risks. Due to the neuro-physiological focus, it is currently not feasible to conduct such a study online or in field conditions. Although our EEG headset was very lightweight, some participants may have found it uncomfortable, affecting their experience.

Our participant sample was primarily composed of young students, a common constraint in university lab studies, especially those involving neuro-physiological scanning. This is due to logistical challenges such as costly equipment, rigorous exclusion criteria, and lengthy protocols. For example, recent fMRI studies [26] (N=25; mostly students), eye-tracking studies [37] (N=16; students, faculty, and staff), and another eye-tracking study [10] (N=19; mostly youth) faced similar constraints. However, our sample exhibited diversity in educational backgrounds, with no participants having a computer science background. Our sample, particularly in terms of age, closely resembled frequent internet users who are more vulnerable to phishing attacks [33]. Subconscious differences in brain activation while processing real and fake websites may persist despite age differences, as observed in both the 19-22 age group and the 30+ age group.

Another limitation is the number of trials presented to participants. While multiple trials are standard in EEG and neuro-imaging experimental design [24, 38] to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio, participants may not face many security-related trials in a short span in real life. Nevertheless, our behavioral results in the malware warnings experiment are well-aligned with a previous large-scale real-life study [9].

Motivation to disregard warnings was also a concern. The reward for ignoring the warning (reading full news) might not have been high enough for participants. Since the experiments were conducted on a lab computer, participants might have ignored warnings more frequently compared to using their own laptops in real-world settings. This suggests that warning heeding rates may be higher than 85% in real-life scenarios, as reflected in the field study by [9].

In the phishing detection task, participants were explicitly asked to identify a website as real or fake. In a real-world attack, victims are often driven to a phishing website from a primary task (e.g., reading an email), and the decision about the site's legitimacy needs to be made implicitly. However, in any case, users ultimately have to decide on the site's legitimacy. Our results show that, despite being asked, users do not spend enough time looking at key phishing indicators and often fail to detect these attacks, although they may subconsciously process real sites differently than fake sites.

### Conclusions and Future Work

We conducted a comprehensive study on phishing detection and malware warnings, measuring users' neural activity, eye gaze patterns, task performance, and their inter-relationships. In phishing detection, our results showed that users do not spend enough time looking at key phishing indicators and often fail to detect these attacks, although they may be highly engaged in the task and subconsciously process real sites differently than fake sites. In the malware warning tasks, our results demonstrated that users frequently read and eventually heed the message embedded within the warning. We also found that a user's personality traits, specifically attention control, directly impact phishing detection accuracy. This suggests that training users to exercise attention control (beyond phishing awareness training) may improve their ability to detect phishing attacks.

Based on our work, we suggest the possibility of building future automated mechanisms that apply a fusion of real-time neural and eye gaze features to infer users' "alertness" state and determine whether users' responses should be relied upon. Such a mechanism could "sanitize" a user's response and enhance the credibility of human decisions in a user-centered security system, serving as a closed-loop between humans and machines. Future research is needed to design and validate such mechanisms in different security domains.

#### A. Sample Warning
[Insert sample warning here]

#### B. Neural Metrics
The B-Alert headset measures and records electrical activity in the brain using sensors placed on the scalp. These signals are first decontaminated from noise sources such as eye blinks, spikes, and muscle movements. The B-Alert cognitive metrics were obtained from ABM’s four-class B-Alert quadratic discriminant function classification algorithm (see Berka et al. [29] and B-Alert User Manual for further details) for each second of data, referred to as an epoch. The mean probability of classifications for the four classes—high engagement, low engagement, distraction, and sleep onset—is calculated. The class with the highest mean probability is assigned to the epoch. For example, if an epoch is classified as high engagement with a probability of 0.45, low engagement as 0.30, distraction as 0.20, and sleep onset as 0.05, then the final class of the epoch will be high engagement. Workload was derived from a two-class Linear discriminant function algorithm (range 0.0 to 1.0) [11, 12, 29].
