k=2(N Ok − N Ok−1)(Ti − k + 1)
Here, Ti is the number of months for i’bounty program.
N Wk and N Ok are the accumulated number of white hats
and the number of peer organizations on the whole platform
at the kth month for organization i, respectively.
Table 6 shows three variations of the regression model. In
all three models, we ﬁnd a highly signiﬁcant positive corre-
lation between the expected reward oﬀered and the number
of vulnerabilities received by that organization per month.
Roughly speaking, a $100 increase in the expected vulnera-
bility reward is associated with an additional 3 vulnerabil-
ities reported per month. We also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant nega-
tive correlation between the Alexa rank and the number of
vulnerabilities in models (2) and (3) suggesting that rank
determines the attractiveness of a website to white hats.
However, it is also possible that less popular websites are
in general less complex in design and implementation, and
thus contain less vulnerabilities. For model (3), we expect
that with higher average platform manpower, an organiza-
tion will receive more attention from white hats and thus will
have more vulnerability reports. However, the analysis does
not yield a conclusive answer, possibly due to the omission
of invitation-only programs and limited sample size.
The quantiﬁed model can be used by organizations when
determining their bug bounty policies and attracting an ef-
fective white hat following. In particular, oﬀering higher re-
wards and running the program for a longer time contributes
to a higher number of reports. The model also contributes
to the security assessment question in Section 4.3.6. Nev-
ertheless, our regression model is only a ﬁrst step towards
modeling the dynamics of the web vulnerability discovery
ecosystem.
It could be extended with more independent
variables, such as the business type of organizations (see
Section 4.3.3), or the expected rewards from peer organiza-
tions in the ecosystem.
5. DISCUSSION
5.1
Importance of Disclosure
Based on our analysis, we believe that disclosing impor-
tant information about vulnerability discovery (such as the
resolve time for each vulnerability, bounty amounts, and
even the detailed reports) is important for the success of
a web vulnerability discovery ecosystem. For the white hat
community, disclosing more vulnerability information not
only enables them to learn and improve, but also poten-
tially allows to make better decisions on target selection, as
we have discussed in Section 4.2.4. The transparency as-
sociated with disclosure could also reduce conﬂicts between
organizations and white hats on issues like the validity of a
report or the reasonableness of a bounty amount. For or-
ganizations, disclosing more information enables the public
(e.g., Internet users, or cyber-insurance providers) to better
assess the security of an organization (Section 4.3.6). Dis-
closure is also vital for the research community to tackle
some of the challenging issues and future research questions
we have discussed. In addition, a platform such as Wooyun
0100200300400500600700800Wh.count(Wooyun)0500100015002000Vulnerabilitycountr=0.98p=0.00020406080100120140160Wh.count(HackerOneP)0100200300400500r=0.95p=0.00with a delayed full disclosure policy also pushes organiza-
tions to ﬁx their reports sooner.
However, there are also potentially less desirable conse-
quences of disclosing vulnerabilities about organizations’ web
systems, such as the leakage of critical information that can
be utilized by black hats. An ideal disclosure policy has
to balance the potential beneﬁts and disadvantages to the
ecosystem or a speciﬁc organization. Several disclosure pro-
grams are moving towards this direction. For example, some
programs on HackerOne disclose only a subset of their vul-
nerabilities to the public. The Github bounty program dis-
closes data about every vulnerability discovered by white
hats, yet intentionally redacts certain details. Further an-
alyzing the beneﬁts and risks of disclosing vulnerability in-
formation, and designing improved disclosure policies is im-
portant future work.
5.2 Potential Incentive Structure Evolution
Our study shows that monetary incentives increase the
number of vulnerability reports (Section 4.3.7). We antic-
ipate that more organizations will start paying bounties,
as more organizations are joining vulnerability disclosure
ecosystems and are competing for the limited attention of
white hats. The amount of an average bounty will likely
rise not only for the purpose of attracting more white hats,
but also for compensating the increasing cost incurred by
white hats to discover vulnerabilities (e.g., to compete with
black hats). In addition, high reward amounts can also be a
positive signal of an organization’s security practices to the
public, similar to the proposal in [30].
Many organizations will continue to not oﬀer bounties.
For small organizations with limited revenues, maintaining
a competitive bounty level could be challenging.
It has
also been suggested that an organization could start with
no bounty ﬁrst, and gradually increase the reward level, to
alleviate the initial surge of reports (including many invalid
submissions) [27], as we have shown in Figure 15. Organiza-
tions that cannot aﬀord paying bounties can resort to other
forms of incentives, such as reputation scores, hall-of-fame
memberships, or even public disclosure.
5.3 Encouraging White Hat Participation
Increasing the size of the white hat community allows
more organizations to be covered and more vulnerabilities to
be found (see Section 4.2.2). A larger white hat community
might also decrease the cost of running bounty programs for
organizations, similar to the increase of supply in any eco-
nomic market. Therefore, potential regulations that hinder
the collaboration between white hats and organizations are
likely detrimental. One such example is the proposed up-
date of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which aims to control
the export of intrusion software. The utilized overly broad
deﬁnition of intrusion software could easily limit the partici-
pation of white hats [29], particularly considering the global
nature of the white hat community [4, 12].
To encourage more white hats to join the ecosystem, or-
ganizations can try to oﬀer a ﬁrst time bonus (see Sec-
tion 4.3.7), organize capture-the-ﬂag activities, etc. In ad-
dition, by analyzing the behavioral patterns and dynamics
of white hats (e.g., Section 4.2.3), bounty platforms can de-
sign customized services for white hats, such as target se-
lection or recommender systems, which match white hats’
skills and organizations’ requirements. For this purpose, it
would be helpful to further investigate vulnerability discov-
ery by white hats (e.g., tool usage) through interview or
survey studies [19].
5.4 Stimulate Participation by Organizations
Our study results provide incentives for organizations to
join vulnerability discovery ecosystems and to beneﬁt from
white hats’ eﬀorts. In addition, government agencies such as
the Federal Trade Commission also encourage organizations
to have a process of receiving and addressing vulnerability
reports [11], which can be achieved by running a bounty
program.
In our work, we contrast two participation models from
the organizations’ perspective. The ﬁrst one is the coercive
participation model, represented by China-based platforms
such as Wooyun. That is, an organization is coerced to join
the ecosystem once a white hat has submitted a vulnerabil-
ity for that organization. The second participation model,
represented by US-based platforms including HackerOne, is
voluntary, i.e., companies explicitly authorize external re-
searchers to study the security of their web systems. Both
models have their advantages and disadvantages. Our re-
sults show that the ﬁrst model is capable of covering a wider
range of organizations, although varying legal conditions in
diﬀerent countries might not allow for such an approach (see,
for example, [28]). Also, this model might allow many severe
vulnerabilities to be found earlier in websites that are not
willing to participate bug bounty and are poorly secured.
This could partly explains the high percentage of SQL in-
jection on Wooyun in Section 1. The coercive model might
be more attractive to white hats, for example, since they
may feel more in control. The second model clearly grows
more slowly when considering the number of participating
organizations. However, voluntary participation likely en-
courages a better response behavior to vulnerability reports,
as we have discussed in Section 4.1.3. To encourage organi-
zations to participate in the voluntary model, future work
is needed to identify and address organizations’ concerns in-
cluding the perceived lack of trustworthiness of the white
hat population [3], misuse of automated vulnerability scan-
ners, and time wasted due to false reports [8].
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have studied emerging web vulnerability
discovery ecosystems, which include white hats, organiza-
tions and bug bounty platforms, based on publicly available
data from Wooyun and HackerOne. The data shows that
white hat security researchers have been making signiﬁcant
contributions to the security of tens of thousands of organi-
zations on the Internet.
We conducted quantitative analyses for diﬀerent aspects
of the web vulnerability discovery ecosystem. Based on our
results, we suggest that organizations should continuously
collaborate with white hats, actively seek to enlarge the
contributor base, and design their recognition and reward
structure based on multiple factors. We have also proposed
future work directions to help to increase the impact and
coverage of these ecosystems.
