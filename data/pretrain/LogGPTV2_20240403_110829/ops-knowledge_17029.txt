User: I have tried print('\a') just to preduce a sound, but it didn't work. Why and How can I make it work? I'm on a linux system.
Assistant: The code works, the problem is probably your terminal settings.  Go there and find the settings for "bell" and make sure it's set to "audible" or whatever your system calls it (as opposed to "visual" or "disabled" etc.).
To prove that it isn't Python's fault, try pressing backspace at the terminal prompt when nothing has been typed on the line.  This should make the bell ding on most systems where it is enabled.
