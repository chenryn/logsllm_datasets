Fig. 5: Wavelet coefﬁcients: using the ﬁrst 10 wavelet coefﬁ-
cients as appliance signatures
An example of wavelet transform on a time-domain signal is
shown in Fig. 4. The shade of color in the ﬁgure corresponds to
the magnitude of the wavelet coefﬁcients. The darker the color,
the bigger the coefﬁcient is. As shown in the lower ﬁgure,
the ﬁrst half of the original signal consists of low frequency
components and the second half of the signal mainly consists
of high frequency components.
E. Threat Model
We assume that the attacker can only obtain reactive power
data from the smart meter. Active power is not considered here
since the focus of this paper is reactive power-based attack as
stated in Section I, and active power-based attack has been
addressed in the literature. The attacker can obtain the power
consumption signatures of the appliances used in the target
user’s residence. This assumption is valid since there are many
ways for the attacker to obtain such information. Existing
research has shown that such information can be leaked to
malicious third parties [14]. Attackers may also run these
appliances at home to obtain signatures from meter readings or
get them from manufactures provided information. Even if the
attacker cannot obtain such information directly, he can still
learn appliance signatures through training techniques [31].
IV. REACTIVE POWER-BASED ATTACK
In this section, we present the privacy attack which can be
used to infer appliance usage information from only reactive

A. Attack Approach
1) Appliance Signature Extraction: For each appliance,
we extract an one-minute window from the beginning of its
reactive power waveform. One minute is enough to capture
the characteristics of appliances because most appliances
reach a stable state in less than one minute. Then wavelet
transform is performed on the extracted piece of waveform to
get the wavelet coefﬁcients. The wavelet coefﬁcients form a
time-frequency representation of the original reactive power
waveform. They represent the frequency distribution of each
appliance when they are turned on, and thus these signatures
can capture the characteristics of each appliance. During the
experiments, we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst 10 coefﬁcients are enough to
distinguish appliances and thus the ﬁrst 10 wavelet coefﬁcients
are used as the appliance signature. A larger number can
be chosen, but
increase the computation overhead.
Examples of appliance signatures are given in Fig. 5.
it will
2) Appliance Identiﬁcation: The appliance identiﬁcation
process consists of three steps: ﬁltering, event detection and
identiﬁcation.
Filtering In the load proﬁles, there are events that appear
to be turning ON/OFF appliances but are actually not. These
events are called deceptive events. Deceptive events are usually
caused by the periodic wake-up of appliances such as refrig-
erator and air conditioner. Since the period of these events
is usually relatively long (at the hour level), they compose
the low frequency components in the waveform. There is also
some noise in the load proﬁles, i.e., impulse that usually occurs
at the beginning of a wave. These noise composes the high
frequency components in the waveform. To ﬁlter out deceptive
events and noise, a Fourier transform is ﬁrst performed on
the waveform to get
the frequency distribution. From the
frequency distribution along with the original waveform, we
identify the estimated frequency of deceptive events and noise.
Then a band-pass ﬁlter [32] is applied on the waveform to
ﬁlter out low frequency deceptive events and high frequency
noise. The new waveform obtained only contains components
that are relevant to appliances. This new waveform is called
the post-ﬁltering waveform. This ﬁltering process is shown in
Fig. 6.
Event Detection
After deceptive events and noise are
ﬁltered out, we need to detect real events that are caused by

appliances. When an event happens, an edge always appears
in the waveform. Therefore, the key is to detect edges in
the post-ﬁltering waveform. To reduce false detection, the
detection process distinguishes between the edges going up
(UpEdge) and the edges going down (DownEdge). For any
two consecutive points in the waveform W , we compute:
Δi = W [i+1]−W [i]. If Δi is larger than the chosen threshold
θ, an UpEdge occurs at time i in W . If Δi is smaller than
−θ, a DownEdge occurs at time i. Obviously, the choice of
θ is very important for the performance of event detection.
If θ is too small, noise may be mistreated as events. If θ
is too big, events triggered by low-power appliances may be
ignored. Fig. 7 shows how the detection accuracy changes with
θ. As can be seen, with the increase of θ, the false positive
rate decreases and the false negative rate increases. In the
experiments, θ is set to be 15 since at this point a balance
can be achieved between the false positive rate and the false
negative rate and the total false detection rate is relatively
low. Our waveform is in the granularity of second. Sometimes
an edge in the waveform lasts for several seconds, and each
second will be recognized as an individual edge. Thus, there
will be redundant edges which should be removed. There are
two cases of redundancy:
• Consecutive UpEdges: When there are a series of consec-
utive UpEdges, only the ﬁrst UpEdge is kept, as shown
in Fig. 8.
• Consecutive DownEdges: When there are a series of
consecutive DownEdges, only the last DownEdge is kept.
This DownEdge captures more information than others so
that no useful frequency component is lost.
Here by consecutive we mean that the edges are next to each
other in time, i.e. with time interval of less than 5 seconds.
The reactive power is unstable compared with active power.
There are always jitters in the waveform when the reactive
power changes. Most
jitters will be removed during the
ﬁltering process. However, some small jitters still exist. The
jitters will result in noisy edges that should be ignored. Fig. 9
shows that a jitter occurs when the appliance is turned ON. The
waveform (the black dashed line) rises when the appliance is
turned ON and drops a little bit. It then stays stable for a while
and falls to zero when the appliance is turned OFF. As shown
in Fig. 9, three edges are detected: an UpEdge (blue line)
when the waveform rises, a DownEdge (red line) right after
the UpEdge and a second DownEdge when the waveform falls
to zero. The ﬁrst DownEdge does not represent a real change
in appliance state and thus is a noisy edge. We remove the
noisy DownEdge and only keep the UpEdge and the second
DownEdge. A jitter can also occur when the appliance is
turned OFF. Then, similar to the case in Fig. 9, the noisy

Fig. 10: Extracting waveforms between matching UpEdges/DownEdges
UpEdge right before the DownEdge is removed.
Identiﬁcation In this step, the appliance that triggers each
UpEdge and DownEdge is identiﬁed. First, the reactive power
waveforms between each pair of UpEdge and DownEdge
are extracted. For each piece of extracted waveform, wavelet
transform is performed to get the wavelet coefﬁcients. Then
the obtained coefﬁcients are compared with the appliance
signatures (such as those shown in Fig. 5) to determine
which appliance corresponds to this piece of waveform. This
identiﬁcation process is demonstrated in Fig. 10 and Fig. 11.
In Fig. 10, we identify the pieces of waveforms needed to be
extracted based on the matching UpEdges and DownEdges. As
shown in the ﬁgure, there is a pair of UpEdge and DownEdge
that are consecutive around 1250th second (marked by the
black dashed line). It is unlikely that an event only lasts
for a second and thus this pair of UpEdge and DownEdge
cannot be processed alone. For pairs like this, there are two
choices: combining this pair with the previous pair (event C
marked by the orange arrow) or ignoring it (event B marked
by the magenta arrow). Waveform pieces for both choices are
extracted.
In Fig. 11, we match the coefﬁcients of each extracted
waveform piece (events A,B,C,D marked by arrows in Fig. 10)
with the appliance signatures shown in Fig. 5 using least
square method. Event A in Fig. 10 is matched with the
signature of microwave oven. Event D in Fig. 10 is matched
with the signature of air conditioner. Event B and event C in
Fig. 10 both match with the signature of kettle.
B. Experiments
We launched reactive power based attacks against the load
proﬁles collected at the three households. The identiﬁcation
results based on the attacks are compared with the real usage
events logged by users to get the false positive rate and false
negative rate for each appliance. The results are shown in

Fig. 11: Matching coefﬁcients of waveforms in Figure. 10 with
the appliance signatures in Figure 5
Table II. We can see that most appliances can be identiﬁed
with low false positive/negative rates. For example, in Apt 1,
the false positive rate can reach 4.2% for lamp, and 1.3% for
microwave oven.
The attack has relatively higher false positive/negative rates
for refrigerator and air conditioner, around 15%, due to the
following reasons. Appliances such as air conditioner and
refrigerator have multiple working states. Different working
states consume different amounts of power. For example, the
air conditioner consumes more power when it is cooling down
the room and consumes less power after the room reaches the
preset temperature. The switches of working states may not
be matched to signatures sometimes and will result in mis-
detections.
From the table, we can see that the false positive/negative
rates for air conditioner and refrigerator are still pretty low,
