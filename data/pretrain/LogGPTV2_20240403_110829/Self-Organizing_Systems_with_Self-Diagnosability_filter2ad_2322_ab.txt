3 Recursive Procedures for Optimally De-
signing a Highly Structured t-OD System
Kohda and Mitsuoka [9] focused on the extension of the
highly structured t-OD system and gave recursive proce-
dures for optimally designing the system having no mutual
tests.
i) A Recursive Procedure to Increase the Upper Bound of
the Number of Faulty Units.
Let Gk−1,h = [V k−1,h, Ek−1,h] represent a system S
consisting of nk−1,h units where k ≥ 1, h ≥ 0. Let V k−1,h
,
V k−1,h
be three subsets of V k−1,h whose car-
dinalities are τk−1 + 1, τk−1, and nk−1,h − 2τk−1 − 1 ≥ 0,
respectively, where V k−1,h
is the complement set to the set
V k−1,h
and τk−1 = τ0 + k − 1, τ0 ≥ 1.

Theorem 5 (Kohda and Mitsuoka [9]) If S is an optimal
highly structured nk−1,h-unit τk−1-OD system having no
then S1 is an optimal highly structured
mutual
(nk−1,h + 2)-unit (τk−1 + 1)-OD system having no mutual
tests where τk−1 = τ0 + k − 1, τ0 ≥ 1, k ≥ 1, h ≥ 0.
ii) A Recursive Procedure to Increase the Number of Units
Let Gk,h−1 = [V k,h−1, Ek−1,h] represent a system S
consisting of nk,h−1 units where k ≥ 0, h ≥ 1. Let
V k,h−1
be some three subsets of
V k,h−1, where V k−1,h
c
is the complement set to the set
V k−1,h
and whose cardinality is τk = τ0 + k,
τ0 ≥ 1.

Theorem 6 (Kohda and Mitsuoka [9]) If S is an optimal
highly structured nk,h−1-unit τk-OD system having no mu-
tual tests, then S2 is an optimal highly structured (nk,h−1 +
1)-unit τk-OD system having no mutual tests where τk =
τ0 + k, τ0 ≥ 1, k ≥ 0, h ≥ 1.
We will refer to the procedures described in Figs. 4 and
5 as “Method 1” and “Method 2”, respectively.
From Theorems 5 and 6, the next corollary follows di-
rectly.

Figure 6. An optimal highly structured 11-unit
4-OD system having no mutual tests.
by applying Method 1, α times, and Method 2, β times, in
arbitrary order to an optimal highly structured n00-unit t0-
OD system, where n = n00 + 2α + β, t = t0 + α, n00 ≥
2t0 + 1, t0 ≥ 1.
Methods 1 and 2 are shown to be of great ﬂexibility
because the original optimal highly structured n-unit t-OD
system can be obtained independently of the assignment of
test links in the optimal highly structured n00-unit t0-OD
system and without the reassignment of their test links. Fur-
thermore Methods 1 and 2 are shown to produce a variety
of highly structured t-OD systems with the minimum num-
ber of test links.

4 Application to Self-Organizing Systems
Constructing a system capable of functioning without
any human support over an extended period is the aim
of many engineers.
In order to fulﬁll this requirement,
several types of self-reconﬁgurable systems were devel-
oped. Fukuda and Nakagawa [3] and Kawauchi, Inaba,
and Fukuda [7] considered a dynamically reconﬁgurable
