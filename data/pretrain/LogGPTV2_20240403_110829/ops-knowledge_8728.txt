User: I need to lock a file for writing in Python. It will be accessed from multiple Python processes at once. I have found some solutions online, but most fail for my purposes as they are often only Unix based or Windows based.
Assistant: Coordinating access to a single file at the OS level is fraught with all kinds of issues that you probably don't want to solve.
Your best bet is have a separate process that coordinates read/write access to that file.
