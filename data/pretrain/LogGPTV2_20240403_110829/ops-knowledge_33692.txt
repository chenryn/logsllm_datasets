User: On the AWS cloud platform, build a highly available web application to achieve automatic scaling and load balancing.
Assistant: 1. Use EC2 to create multiple instances as web servers. 2. Use Auto Scaling to automatically scale the number of instances, and automatically add or delete instances according to demand. 3. Use Elastic Load Balancer for load balancing and distribute traffic to different instances to ensure system stability and reliability. 4. Use cloud databases (such as RDS) to store data to achieve high availability and redundant backup of data. 5. Use S3 to store static files, such as pictures, videos, etc., to improve system performance and access speed. 6. Use CloudFront as a CDN to speed up access and reduce latency and bandwidth consumption. 7. Use CloudWatch to monitor system performance and resource utilization, find problems in time and optimize them. 8. Use Route 53 as the DNS resolution service to ensure the reliability and availability of domain name resolution.
