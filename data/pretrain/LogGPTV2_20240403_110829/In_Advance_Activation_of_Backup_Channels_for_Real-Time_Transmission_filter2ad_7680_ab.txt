# Evaluation of the PBC Scheme in Integrated Services Networks

## 2.3 Experimental Evaluation

The efficiency of the proposed PBC (Predictive Backup Channel) scheme is highly dependent on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the channel. This PDF is used to determine the values of Φ and df. For a given PDF, Φ is a function of the selected df. The results presented in this section show that the PDF has a long tail, resulting in a very low false failure rate (Φ).

### 2.3.1 Network Simulation Setup

The first experiment simulated the network shown in Figure 1 using a Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) scheduler at each node. The traffic E(t) was introduced into the network following the T-SPEC traffic specification. The network simulator also provided a high-priority channel for sending NACK messages. The bandwidth reservation R in the nodes was determined at channel establishment time as described in Section 3.1.

To introduce load into the network, 5 channels were created in each node with a load index ranging from 0% (no load) to 100% (full load). The load index represents the percentage of the non-reserved bandwidth in the link that is being used.

### 2.3.2 Results and Analysis

- **Network**: 
  - **Node 1**:
    - **L1**: Link 1
    - **WFQ**: Weighted Fair Queuing
  - **Node n**:

#### Figure 6: End-to-End Packet Delay Distribution
- **Traffic**: Soccer, Lambs, News
- **Delay (s)**: 0.002, 0.004, 0.006, 0.008, 0.01, 0.012, 0.014, 0.016, 0.018, 0.02
- **Load Index**: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

Figure 6 shows the density functions for packet arrival in simulations with Soccer traffic for various load indexes and a 0.02s end-to-end deadline. It is evident that all packets arrive well before their nominal deadlines, and the more loaded the network, the more the packets are delayed. For example, with full load, the maximum delay is 0.0074s, which is less than half the deadline (0.01s). Therefore, for this sample, a value of df = 0.01s would be a clear choice.

#### Table 2: Φ Values and Bandwidth Reduction for Different Traffics and Delays
- **Traffic**: Soccer, Lambs, News
- **Delays (s)**: 1, 0.1, 0.01
- **df**: d/4, d/2, d/8, d/16
- **Φ**: Failure detection rate
- **ℜ**: Bandwidth reduction

Several conclusions can be drawn from the results:
1. For a failure detection time of dtotal/2, the Φ values are zero (except for Soccer traffic with a 0.01s deadline).
2. For high deadlines, a reduced value of df can be used because packet delays are far below their nominal deadlines.
3. Although a df = dtotal/2 often provides the best reduction, it implies a reservation in the backup channel of dtotal/2. In some cases, reducing the reservation using a greater delay (e.g., df = dtotal/4) may be more efficient.

### 2.3.3 Discussion

One question that arises is why the packet delays are much lower than their deadlines. There are two main reasons:
1. The bursty characteristics of the traffic.
2. The traffic characterization and delay equations (such as Equation 1) make a very coarse approximation of the traffic dynamics, leading to very pessimistic delay bounds.

Another result of the experiments is that the end-to-end delays of the first packets transmitted in a channel are minimal. This is logical because when the first packet is transmitted, the node queues are empty, resulting in no queue delay. The end-to-end delay only depends on the bandwidth reservation and network parameters: d'B = (M + Ctot)/R + Dtot. This behavior allows for a tighter df value, thereby reducing the network resource reservation. Therefore, the delay for channel B can be dtotal with the condition that d’B < df. For example, for Dtotal = 0.1s, the bandwidth reservation for channels A and B is 1.93Mb/s. The delay of the first packet in channel B will be 0.022s, so df can be 0.1 - 0.022 = 0.078s.

## 3. Conclusions

The PBC scheme has been compared with the Multiple Copy (MC) and Reactive Backup Channel (RBC) approaches in both Integrated and Differentiated Services Networks. The experiments in Integrated Services show that the new scheme is very efficient and can provide savings of up to 50% in network resources.
