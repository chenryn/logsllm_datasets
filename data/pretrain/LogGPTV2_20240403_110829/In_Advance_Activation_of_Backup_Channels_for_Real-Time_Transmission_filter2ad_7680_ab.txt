In  summary,  the  proposed  PBC  scheme  reserves  less  resources  that  the  other  two 
schemes.  The  resource  saving  are  between  are  between  10  to  50%  over  the  RBC  and  MC 
protocols.  
2.3.- Experimental evaluation 
The efficiency of the scheme presented depends clearly on the PDF of the channel. 
This distribution will be used to obtain the Φ and df values. Moreover, for a given PDF, Φ is a 
function of the selected df . The results presented in this section shows that the PDF has a long 
tail so the false failure rate Φ is very low.  
The first experiment simulated the network in Figure (1) using a WFQ scheduler in 
the  nodes.  As  shown  in  Figure  (5)  the  traffic  generated  E(t)  is  introduced  in  the  network 
following  the  T-SPEC  traffic  specification.  The  network  simulator  provides  also  a  high 
priority channel to send the NACK messages. The bandwidth reservation R in the nodes was 
obtained at channel establishment time as described in section 3.1. In order to introduce load 
in the network, 5 channels were created in each node with a load index that ranges from 0% 
(no  load)  to  100%  (full  load).  The  load  index  is  the  used  percentage  of  the  non-reserved 
bandwidth in the link.

Figure 5: Network scenario simulation  
Figure (6) represents the density functions for packet arrival in the simulations with 
Soccer traffic for various load indexes with a 0.02s end-to-end deadline. It is clearly shown 
that  all  packets  arrive  much  sooner  than  their  nominal  deadlines  and  the  more  loaded  the 
network is, the more the packets are delayed.  For example, with full load the maximum delay 
is  0.0074s  seconds,  that  is  below  of  half  the  deadline  (0.01s).  Therefore,  for  this  sample  a 
value of df=0.01s would be a clear choice. 
Table  2  shows  the  Φ values  for  different  failure  detection  time  df  and  end-to-end 
delays for the Soccer, Lambs and News traffic. The bandwidth reduction (the ℜ columns) is 
obtained for each df value taking into account the Φ value. 
Several conclusions can be drawn from the results presented here. First, for a failure 
detection time of dtotal/2 the Φ are zero (except for Soccer traffic and 0.01s deadline). Second, 
for high deadlines a reduced value of df can be used due to the fact that packets delays are far 
behind from their nominal deadline. Although in much cases the reduction for a df=dtotal/2 is 
the better, this implies a reservation in the backup channel of dtotal/2. In some cases it would 
better  to  reduce  the  reservation  using  a  greater  delay  (for  example  if  df=dtotal/4  the  backup 
channel delay is 3/4dtotal and the reservation is reduced).

Table 2: Φ values and bandwidth reduction for different traffics and delays. 
One  question  that  arises  is  why  the  packet  delays  are  so  much  lower  than  their 
deadlines. There are two main reasons:  first, is the bursty characteristics of the traffic and 
second,  is  that  traffic  characterisation  and  delay  equations  (as  equation  (1))  makes  a  very 
coarse approximation of the traffic dynamics so delay bound are very pessimistic. 
Another  result  of  the  experiments  is  that  the  end-to-end  delays  of  the  first  packets 
transmitted  in  a  channel  are  minimal.  This  is  logical  because  when  the  first  packet  is 
transmitted in a channel the node queues are empty. This implies that there is no queue delay 
and the end-to-end delay only depends on the bandwidth reservation and network parameters: 
d'B=(M+Ctot)/R+Dtot. This behaviour allows tightening the df value and therefore reducing the 
network  resource  reservation.  Therefore,  the  delay  for  channel  B  can  be  dtotal  with  the 
condition that d’B < df. For example, for Dtotal=0.1s the bandwidth reservation for channel A 
and B is 1.93Mb/s. The delay of the first packet in channel B will be 0.022s so df can be 0.1-
0.022= 0.078s. 
3. Conclusions 
The  PBC  scheme  has  been  compared  with  the  Multiple  Copy  (MC)  and  Reactive 
Backup Channel (RBC) approaches using Integrated and Differentiated Services Networks. 
The experiments in Integrated Services shows that the new scheme is very efficient and can 
provide savings about 50% of network resources.
