algorithm that accurately separates spam and benign numbers.
Fifth, we propose novel, reliable, and data-driven data labeling ap-
proaches to find known spam and benign numbers and to construct
our ground truth from real-world large CDR records. However, as
mentioned before, since the previous work utilizes synthetic data,
the labeling procedure could not be used in a real scenario and is
not representative of real-world phone calls.
Finally, some of these systems in order to properly generate their
detection models and the social networks of users have to store and
analyze the history of users over extended periods of times. This
would be quite impractical, however, in the real-world scenario
where the number of daily call records reach several millions. On
the other hand, in this work, we demonstrate how to augment spam
number blacklists using efficient methods that could be readily used
in real-world service providers.
3 DATA COLLECTION AND LABELING
In this section we describe the datasets we collected to perform
three main tasks: (i) creating a seed of spam and benign phone
numbers, (ii) analyzing spammers’ behavior and similarities among
spam phone numbers, and (iii) evaluating our detection system on
a separate, recent dataset.
3.1 CDR Data Collection
Normally, telephone carriers record and store phone call activities
in a specific data format called Call Detail Record (CDR) [22]. In
short, a CDR is a data record produced by a telephone exchange
that reports details of a phone call, such as the source number (the
caller), the destination number (the recipient), call start time, call
end time, etc.
To perform our study, we analyze large datasets of real-world
CDRs provided to us by a well-known leading mobile service provider
in China. These CDRs were collected at telephone exchange devices
that route phone calls from outside main land China to customers
of the telephone provider. The data was collected during eight full
days of operation: four days in March 2016 (March 12th − 15th),
one day in June 2017 (the 5th of June), and three days in July 2017
(July 15th − 17th).
We divide these CDR datasets into three datasets. The first one,
Dh, contains the CDRs from March 2016, and is used as a historic
data to facilitate the labeling of benign phone numbers, as explained
more in details later. The second dataset, Da, includes the CDRs
Session 7: Cellular, Phone, and EmailASIACCS’18, June 4–8, 2018, Incheon, Republic of Korea275from June 5th 2017. We use this dataset to conduct pilot exper-
iments, validate our intuitions, analyze behavioral patterns and
identify the features that we then use for spam detection purposes.
The third dataset, De, consists of the CDRs collected in July 2017,
and is used as a separate dataset for evaluating our detection system.
The three datasets are summarized in Table 1.

call Volume
Dh includes 1, 051, 046 source numbers involved in 2, 163, 018
phone call transactions. Da contains more than 11.7 million CDRs
from almost 6 million source phone numbers. The maximum num-
ber of calls from a single source phone number was 40,088. Each
day of the De dataset contains between about 9.4 and 13.5 million
calls, from about 4.4 to 5.4 million source phone numbers.
It is worth noting that a large portion of source numbers involved
in the three datasets only made one phone call on one single day
(e.g., 85.4%, 85%, and 85.3% source numbers for each day of the De
dataset called one time respectively). In Figure 1, we report call
volume distribution and some simple statistics for each day in De
and Da datasets. In the figure, we specifically show the 50th, 75th,
90th, and 98th percentile values of the call volume, and the total
number of source numbers that made phone calls at least twice on
that day. We purposely remove all the source numbers that only
made one call on one individual day from the dataset to plot call
volume distribution because of lack of information on such records.

Da and De
3.2 Data Labeling
Labeling spam numbers. To label spam phone numbers, we rely
on two sources: (i) a set, Sc, of phone numbers labeled as spam by
the provider of the CDR datasets, and (ii) a set of spam numbers,
Sb, derived from information collected from the Baidu Number Au-
thentication Platform. Baidu’s platform collects complaints about
unwanted/spam calls from a very large user population (mostly
based in China). Through these complaints, users can report the
source telephone number of the unwanted/spam calls. Similar
crowdsourced efforts also exist in the US (e.g., 800notes.com). We
obtained access to this dataset via a query API provided by Baidu.
Given a phone number, querying Baidu’s API returns how many
users have complained about the number (or no response, if no
information about the number is found).
It is worth noting that neither of these two sources provides per-
fect ground truth. For instance, Sc was mostly manually compiled,
and appears to include subjective decisions on labeling that may not
be always supported by hard evidence. Similarly, there is a question
of how many user complaints recorded by Baidu should be suffi-
cient to label a phone number as spam in Sb (few user complaints
may be an indication of unwanted calls, but not necessarily spam-
or fraud-related calls). In our evaluation, we consider two different
rules to label spam numbers. The first labeling rule consists in label-
ing as spam those numbers in the intersection between Sc and Sb,
where Sb includes all numbers that have been complained about
according to Baidu. The second rule labels as spam all numbers
in Sb(θ), where Sb(θ) is the subset of phone numbers in Sb that
have been complained about by more than θ users, according to
Baidu’s API. This second rule is along the lines of recent work on
building phone blacklisting based on CDR collected from phone
honeypots [13].
Benign numbers. Surprisingly, labeling benign numbers with
high confidence is significantly more challenging than labeling
spam numbers (this issue is not unique to our work, and has been
pointed out by others as well [13]), due to difficulties in tracing
back the ownership of a phone number or attributing reputation to
a known phone owner. Therefore, to label benign phone numbers
we take a best effort, data-driven approach based on “aged data,” as
explained below.
First, we consider the set of all source numbers, S′, found in
dataset Dh collected in March 2016, and the set S′′ of source num-
bers from datasets Da and De, which were collected more than a
year later, as detailed earlier. We then compute the intersection
S′ ∩ S′′, remove numbers that were complained about one or more
times according to Baidu’s API, and label the remaining numbers in
the intersection as benign. The intuition is that numbers that have
been in use for more than a year and have never been complained
about are highly likely legitimate phone numbers.
4 FEATURE DERIVATION AND ANALYSIS
In this section we discuss the intuitions behind our features, and
back this intuitions with appropriate measurements over real-world
CDR data.
4.1 Phone Number Format and Conventions
Although different countries use different phone number formats
(e.g., the length of phone numbers vary by country), most of them
share one similar property: the initial (left side) digits of a number,
called prefix, are typically used to identify a geographic location, a

For example, in China
the first seven to eight digits of landline numbers are typically used
to specify that the number belongs to a certain local area in one
specific province. Also, the first three digits of Chinese mobile phone
numbers typically indicate the service provider that registered the
number, and the subsequent four digits usually represent a local
area where this number was registered.
4.2 Spam Targets
Spamming (regardless of medium) requires three basic elements:
a list of recipients, the content to be advertised, and a mass distri-
bution channel [19]. For telephone spammers, they first require a
list of potential victim phone numbers, which we refer to as the
hit list. In addition, some spammers have specific goals which re-
quire phone calls targeting certain groups of people, for example
to defraud them, conduct product sales or launch an ad campaign
targeting people residing in one or more geographical regions.
Although there exist a number of possible ways in which a spam-
mer could gather target phone numbers to be added to the hit list
(e.g., purchasing from a reseller, crawling the Internet, etc.), a cost
effective method is to automatically generate target phone num-
bers that likely all belong to the same set of target geographical
regions (e.g., a set of provinces). This goal could be achieved by
selecting a set of target prefixes, and automatically generating a
list of phone numbers that share these prefixes. Furthermore, in
modern phone spam campaigns, spammers tend to use multiple
colluding accounts [18], which helps with spreading the call volume
among multiple sources and concealing obvious spam-related be-
havioral patterns to avoid detection by existing anti-spam systems.
At the same time, these colluding spam numbers may draw victim
numbers from a shared hit list and exhibit somewhat similar calling
behaviors.
4.3 Common Prefix Analysis
To verify the intuitions discussed above, we perform a number of
measurements on real-world CDR data. In particular, we are inter-
ested in verifying whether spam numbers contact numerous target
prefixes (i.e., victims that reside in different areas), and whether
there exist spam numbers that call largely overlapping sets of target
prefixes, which may be an indication of spam numbers that collude
to deliver a spam campaign.
To this end, we analyze the calling behavior of phone numbers
in the CDR dataset Da collected on Jun 5th 2017. We consider
all pairs (si , tj) or source and destination phone numbers in the
recorded calls, and label all source numbers, si, according to the
labeling rules described in Section 3.2 (for spam numbers, we use
the intersection of Baidu’s results, Sb, and spam numbers from
the provider of CDRs, Sc), obtaining 301 known spam numbers
and 70 benign source numbers. We then filter out all pairs (si , tj)
for which the source number could not be labeled, and replace
each destination number, tj, in the remaining data with its k-digit
prefix, t
(e.g., with k = 4, the destination number 5551234567
would simply become 5551). Also, given a source number, si, let
(k)
= {t1, t2, . . . , tn} be the set of all different k-digit prefixes
T
i
contacted by si, as observed in Da.
(k)
j
(k)
l ∩ T
First let us consider the 301 numbers labeled as spam. For each
pair of spam numbers, (sl , sm), we then measure the number of
(k)
common prefixes P(sl , sm) = T
m . We repeat these measure-
ment among the 70 source numbers we were able to label as benign.
Finally, we compare the distribution of the number of common
prefixes, P(sl , sm), obtained from the two groups.
Figures 2 and 3 visually present the results. For this analysis, k,
the number of prefix digits in destination numbers, is set to 7. In the
graphs, each node is a source phone number, and two numbers, sl
and sm, are connected by an edge if P(sl , sm) >= 10. There are 301
spam numbers in figure 2 and 70 benign numbers in figure 3. As can
be seen, many spam phone numbers are connected, indicating they
contacted largely overlapping sets of target prefixes. On the other
hand, nodes in the benign numbers graph are mostly disconnected.

common 7-digit destination number prefixes among pairs
of spam numbers
Figure 3: Graphical representation of existence of at least 10
common 7-digit destination number prefixes among pairs

In the experiment above, k = 7. This is because numbers with
common 7-digit prefixes indicate mobile users that reside in the
same geographical area and subscribe to the same provider, as
described in section 4.1. We have also experimented with other
values for k and observed that k = 6 is also quite useful in sep-
arating spam source numbers from benign ones as a lot of spam
numbers contacted destination numbers that share the same 6-digit
prefixes in our dataset. In contrast, analyzing the 6-digit prefixes
of destination numbers called by benign numbers does not show
notable correlation among benign numbers. Figure 4 summarizes
our findings related to 6- and 7-digit destination prefixes, where

a certain number of common destination prefixes is plotted. For
example, the purple line shows that 93% of spam numbers share
at least 25 6-digit prefixes with one another. Compared with this,
the green line shows that only 22% of benign numbers share 25
6-digit prefixes. Also, while spam numbers share 7-digit prefixes,
the percentage of benign numbers with common 7-digit prefixes is
lower.
We also observed that if k = 5, the prefix becomes too generic so
that benign and spam numbers start to show similar characteristics.
This is shown in Figure 5, where at first glance it might seem
that a far larger portion of spam numbers share 5-digit prefixes
compared to benign numbers, however, closer examination reveals
that a notable portion of benign numbers also share a lot of 5-digit
prefixes among their destination numbers. This suggests that should
k = 5 is used in our system, it would lead to lots of false positives.
Similarly, k = 8 is too specific for destination numbers and not
too many spam/benign numbers share 8-digit prefixes among their
destination numbers. Figure 5 also shows this where the benign
and spam 8-digit prefixes lines almost overlap.

source numbers in terms of the number of common 6- and
7-digit destination number prefixes
4.4 Call Volume Distribution
We now analyze the distribution of the number of calls (i.e., the call
volume) for source numbers in our CDR datasets. To this end, let
us consider dataset Da. Figure 1 shows that 90% of source numbers
from Da (06/05) made less than 7 calls per day. This shows that most
source numbers make only few calls per day. This results, however,
aggregate the behavior of known spam, benign, and unlabeled
numbers. To measure whether the call volume differs significantly
between source numbers that are likely involved in phone spam
and benign numbers, we proceed as follows.
We first sample CDR records from Da by selecting 5% of source
numbers uniformly and randomly. Then, we group these phone
