User: I created a virtualenv around my project, but when I try to activate it I cannot.
It might just be syntax or folder location, but I am stumped right now.
You can see below, I create the virtualenv and call it venv. Everything looks good, then I try to activate it by running source venv/bin/activate
I'm thinking it might just have to do with my system path, but not sure what to point it to (I do know how to edit the path). I'm on python 7 / windows os, virtual env 2.2.x

Assistant: If some beginner, like me, has followed multiple Python tutorials now possible has multiple Python versions and/or multiple versions of pip/virtualenv/pipenv... 
In that case, answers listed, while many correct, might not help. 
The first thing I would try in your place is uninstall and reinstall Python and go from there.
