User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the process of computing data from the 2kSOSP.log file. The CacheManager is looking for partitions rdd_42_20 and rdd_42_21, which are not found, so they are computed. The HadoopRDD is then used to input split the file into chunks. The PythonRunner is used to measure the total, boot, init, and finish times. The Executor is then used to finish tasks 16.0, 17.0, 18.0, and 19.0, and assign tasks 1221, 1222, and 1223.
