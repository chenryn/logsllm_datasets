sion entropy if h(Xj) were higher. Note that for all permis-
sions with high entropy, the mutual information between
business information and permissions is high (compare the
white and black bars in the lower three histograms of Fig. 1).
Figure 3: Direct comparison of the both objective
functions: log-likelihood R(ll) and pairwise top-down
costs R(S) for various values of the linear weight λ.
Therefore one can reason that knowledge of S might possi-
bly (but not necessarily) also provide signiﬁcant absolute
information gain on permissions with low-entropy.
Given these ﬁndings, we conclude that for the enterprise
considered, the organizational unit provides useful top-down
information. The information provided by job-codes is al-
ready provided by the organizational unit as can be seen
from the very small gain in mutual information when both
are used together (compare the two lower histograms in
Fig. 1). Therefore, for the data at hand, it is reasonable
to ignore the job-codes and just incorporate the organiza-
tion unit into the role-mining process. In the next section,
we will report on several experiments with both types of
business information.
6.2 Role Mining Experiments
In this section, we evaluate our algorithm on real-world
data. As explained in the introduction, the two criteria of a
good hybrid role mining solution are:
1. the role decomposition captures most of the given user-
permission assignment matrix without overﬁtting, and
2. the user-role assignment is easy to interpret from a
business perspective.
In order to quantitatively assess a given role mining result,
we introduce two measures: the generalization ability and
the interpretability of an RBAC system.
Generalization Ability.
We quantify the ability of a set of roles to generalize to new
users in order to measure how precisely the underlying struc-
ture of a user-permission assignment matrix is captured. To
justify this measure, suppose that a new employee enters the
company. It is clearly undesirable to re-design the set of roles
to accommodate each new employee. Therefore, the existing
set of roles should suﬃce to endow the new employee with
all the permissions that he needs to accomplish his job. At
the same time, according to the principle of least privilege,

he should not be given any extra permissions beyond those
he needs for his job (automated role provisioning is itself an
interesting problem, which was recently considered in [16]).
In contrast, a role set that does not generalize to new
users might well replace the existing direct user-permission
assignments, but must be adapted for each new employee.
This is the reason why we did not simply use the devia-
tion kx − z ⊗ uk to assess how well the structure of the
direct assignment is discovered, even though this is often
advocated in the context of role mining (e.g. [21]). The
deviation measure alone would be appropriate in a lossy-
compression scenario. However, it is inappropriate for access
control data since it also accounts for the coverage of excep-
tional and wrong assignments. Moreover, note that a role
structure that generalizes well substantially eases the prob-
lem of maintaining an RBAC conﬁguration as an enterprise
evolves, provided that the functions in the enterprise do not
dramatically change during this evolution.
We propose the following two-step experiment to measure
the generalization ability of a role mining algorithm:
1. The algorithm gets only a subset of the users-permis-
sion assignment as the input for ﬁnding a role decom-
position.
2. For each user from a second, disjoint subset, we take
the business attribute (e.g. his organizational unit)
plus a small fraction of his permissions to identify the
roles that best suit him. From these roles, all other
permissions of the user are predicted.
Since the second (the hidden) set of users comes from the
same enterprise (with the same probability distribution on
the user-permission assignment), a role mining solution that
generalizes well should be able to give a precise prediction.
We implement the experiment as follows. From the en-
tire user-permission assignment and business information,
we randomly choose a set of 3000 users. These are used
to infer a set of roles, using our method described in Sec-
tion 5.3. From the remaining users, we randomly choose a
fraction κ of permissions (e.g. 10%). These permissions, to-
gether with the business information, is then used to choose
the best-matching role set. Formally, we compute the total
risk (12), where, to compute the log-likelihood costs (10), we
only sum over the revealed permissions jκ. Each remaining
user i is then assigned to the set of roles ˆLi with minimal
risk, i.e.
ˆLi := arg minL∈L
Ri,L .
(24)
The set of roles is then used to predict all permissions of user
i. Let ˆzi· be the assignment to the best-matching set of roles.
The estimated permissions of user i are then computed as
ˆxi· = ˆzi·⊗ ˆu, where ˆu is the role-permission relation found in
the role mining step. Finally, the relative Hamming distance
between the estimated and true permissions of user i, kˆxi· −
xi·k/D, i.e. the fraction of wrongly predicted permissions, is
the measure for the generalization error of the inferred roles.
Interpretability.
We formulate the second measure, the business relevance
of the role assignments, by the conditional entropy of the
role set Li of a user i, given his business information si, i.e.
h(Li|si). This captures the requirement that all users with
the same business attribute should obtain the same set of
roles. Thus, the knowledge of the business attribute should,
ideally, determine the roles an employee is assigned to. A
set of roles, however, might be shared by users with diﬀer-
ent business attributes. Note that this measure resembles
the relevance analysis for business information that we in-
troduced in Section 4. There, we required that the given
business information should have a high mutual information
with the permissions (recall I(Xj; S) = h(Xj)− h(Xj|S)) in
order to agree with the permission structure (and therefore
be useful for role mining). Following the same line of reason-
ing, we require roles to agree with the business information.
Role decompositions that fulﬁll this requirement are easy to
interpret from the business perspective.

For
low λ, it is possible to substantially improve on the inter-
pretability of the role decomposition while preserving good
generalization ability.
For hybrid role mining with job-codes this is not possi-
ble. The generalization ability increases immediately for
even small λ. This result conﬁrms the ﬁndings of our anal-
ysis of these two types of business information carried out
in Section 6.1. The job-codes do not agree as well with
the direct user-permission assignment as the organizational
units do. Hence, using job-codes, it is only possible to trade
oﬀ generalization ability for business interpretability. How-
ever, with organization units, one can improve the business
interpretability without substantially increasing the gener-
alization error.
We directly compare the two quality measures with each
other for diﬀerent values of λ in Figure 5 for the experi-
ment with the organizational units. The graph shows that
it is possible to improve the results of role mining by us-
ing our uniﬁed objective function to incorporate business
information into the role mining process: Changing λ along
the straighter parts of the curve gives improved solutions,
whereas the more curved parts mark the solutions that are
Pareto-optimal with respect to the two measures. In a con-
crete application, the trade-oﬀ between generalization and
interpretability must be chosen such that the side conditions
are met. For example, one might require that no more than
some given percentage of permissions of a new employee are
wrongly predicted by the solution. Viewed more generally,
optimizing generalization performance and interpretability
is a multi-objective optimization problem.
7. CONCLUSION
We have divided the hybrid role mining problem into two
parts and provided solutions for them: determining the rel-
evance of business information for role mining, and incorpo-
rating this information into a hybrid role mining algorithm.
We solved the ﬁrst problem with an entropy-based measure
of relevance and the second by deriving an objective function
that combines a probabilistic model of RBAC with business
information.
To validate our solutions, we carried out experiments us-
ing actual enterprise data. The results show that our ap-
proach ﬁnds roles with the following properties: they gener-
alize well, they are easy to interpret (i.e., intuitively under-
standable) from the business perspective, and they have high
predictability in that they approximate closely the given
user-permission assignment. All of these properties are de-
sirable as they have direct, positive consequences for the
administration and maintenance of RBAC-based systems.
Generalization facilitates the maintenance of RBAC since
new users can be easily equipped with needed permissions
without creating new roles. Interpretable roles simplify both
the role’s life-cycle management and adding new users to the
system. Finally, predictability leads to increased security,
since predictive roles implement closely the authorization
policy given by the original user-permission assignment.
As future work, we will investigate an adaptive weighting
scheme of the business information. Namely, not every value
of a business attribute might be equally descriptive for the
permissions received by a user with this attribute. Adaptive
weighting might enable an even more adaptive inclusion of
speciﬁc business attributes. Furthermore, we will explore
Figure 5: Generalization error versus conditional
role entropy for the experiment using organization
units. The dashed lines represent the standard de-
viation over ten repeated experiments.
Results.
We carried out hybrid role mining experiments for two dif-
ferent types of business information. The ﬁrst experiment
uses the organization units as business information, as sug-
gested by our analysis in Section 6.1. Our second experiment
uses the users’ job-codes. In Figure 4, we plot the two de-
scribed measures for both kinds of business information (OE
left, JC right). For the OE-experiment, we directly compare
these two measures, as displayed in Figure 5.
Figure 4 (left) compares, for diﬀerent weighting factors λ,
the two measures on the role decompositions that were dis-
covered. The case with λ = 0 corresponds to pure bottom-
up role mining without business information. While the
generalization error slightly increases with λ, the mean con-
ditional role set entropy given the business information de-
creases drastically if λ is increased from zero to a small value.
Hence, the correspondence between the user-role assignment
and the users’ organizational unit substantially improves as
business information is taken into account. Even for small
values of λ, the roles can be better interpreted as business
roles. Since this gain in the business meaning of the user-
role assignment comes at the expense of only a small de-
crease in the generalization ability of the roles, it is a price
worth paying. For λ > 0.04, the entropy h(Li|si) does not
substantially further improve whereas the prediction error
rises. In this interval, the two parts of our objective func-
tion are antagonistic and hence a further increase of λ is not
desirable.
The right part of Figure 4 displays the results obtained
by using the job-codes as business information. In order to
compare the two experiments, Figure 4 shows both results
for axes with the same scale. Note that the two trends of the
conditioned role entropy (blue diamonds) cannot be directly
compared since they are computed with respect to the two
diﬀerent types of business information. However, one can
reason about the generalization error, which is in both cases
computed with respect to the same user-permission assign-
ment. While for the job-codes (right graph) the general-
ization error converges exponentially to the maximum with

given RBAC systems while preserving their inherent busi-
ness semantic. The quantitative methods of our approach
could also be a starting point to learn about the relationship
between the access control data and the business structure
of both domains.
