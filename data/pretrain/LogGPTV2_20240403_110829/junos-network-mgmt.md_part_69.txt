### 5. Enable sFlow Technology on a Specific Interface

To enable sFlow technology on a specific interface, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `protocols sflow` configuration mode.
2. Set the sample rate for both ingress and egress traffic on the desired interface.

```shell
[edit protocols sflow]
user@switch# set interfaces et-0/0/1.1 sample-rate ingress 100 egress 100
```

### 6. Commit the Configuration

After configuring the sFlow settings, commit the changes to apply them.

```shell
[edit protocols sflow]
user@switch# commit
```

### Verify the Configuration

#### Check the Results of the Configuration

Use the `show protocols sflow` command to verify the sFlow configuration.

```shell
[edit]
user@switch# show protocols sflow
agent-id 10.1.12.0/24;
polling-interval 0;
sample-rate {
    ingress 16000;
    egress 16000;
}
collector 192.168.200.100;
interfaces et-0/0/54.1 {
    sample-rate {
        ingress 100;
        egress 100;
    }
}
interfaces et-0/0/56.0;
interfaces et-0/0/57.1 {
    sample-rate {
        ingress 100;
        egress 100;
    }
}
```

### Verification

#### Verify Configured sFlow Technology

##### Purpose

Verify that sFlow monitoring is enabled for an EVPN-VXLAN network.

##### Action

From operational mode, enter the `show protocols sflow` command.

```shell
user@switch> show protocols sflow
sFlow : Enabled
Adaptive fallback : Disabled
Sample limit : 300 packets/second
Sample limit Threshold : 0 packets/second
Polling interval : 0 second
Sample rate egress : 1:2048: Disabled
Sample rate ingress : 1:100: Enabled
Agent ID : 10.1.12.0/24
Source IP address : 10.1.12.0
```

### sFlow Support on Routers

#### sFlow for GRE Encapsulation

On PTX10001-36MR, PTX10003, PTX10004, PTX10008, and PTX10016 devices, sFlow supports the export of Extended Tunnel Egress Structure fields for traffic entering IPv4 or IPv6 GRE tunnels. This feature is supported only when sFlow is enabled in the ingress direction.

##### Supported Traffic Scenarios

- Incoming IPv4 traffic that undergoes IPv4 GRE encapsulation
- Incoming IPv6 traffic that undergoes IPv4 GRE encapsulation
- Incoming IPv4 traffic that undergoes IPv6 GRE encapsulation
- Incoming IPv6 traffic that undergoes IPv6 GRE encapsulation

##### Extended Tunnel Egress Structure Fields and Values

| Field Name | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Protocol reported | 0x2f (GRE) |
| Source IP | IPv4 or IPv6 address of the tunnel source |
| Destination IP | IPv4 or IPv6 address of the tunnel destination endpoint |
| Length | 0 |
| Source port | 0 |
| Destination port | 0 |
| TCP flags | 0 |
| Priority | 0 |

#### sFlow Sample Size

Starting in Junos OS Evolved 23.1R1 release for PTX Series devices, you can configure the sFlow sample size of the raw packet header. The configurable range is from 128 bytes through 512 bytes.

```shell
set protocols sflow sample-size <Sample-Size>
```

If the configured sample size is greater than the actual packet size, the actual size of the packet is exported. The default sample size is 128 bytes if not configured.

#### sFlow Limitations on Routers

- Trio chipset cannot support different sampling rates for each family. Only one sampling rate can be supported per line card.
- Adaptive load balancing sampling is applied per line card and not per interface under the line card.
- Routers support configuration of only one sampling rate (inclusive of ingress and egress rates) on a line card. The router programs the lowest rate as the sampling rate for all interfaces of that line card.
- You can configure sFlow only on Ethernet interfaces (et-*) for certain PTX Series devices.

### Example: Configure sFlow Technology to Monitor Network Traffic

#### Requirements

- One EX Series switch with Junos OS Release 9.3 or later
- One MX Series router with Junos OS Release 18.1 or later
- One QFX3500 switch with Junos OS Release 11.3 or later

#### Topology

The sFlow agent runs on the switch, combining interface counters and flow samples and sending them to the sFlow collector.

#### Configuration

##### CLI Quick Configuration

Copy and paste the following commands into the switch terminal window:

```shell
[edit protocols]
set sflow collector 10.204.32.46 udp-port 5600
set sflow interfaces ge-0/0/0
set sflow polling-interval 20
set sflow sample-rate egress 1000
```

##### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Configure the IP address and UDP port of the collector:**

   ```shell
   [edit protocols]
   user@switch# set sflow collector 10.204.32.46 udp-port 5600
   ```

   Note: You can configure a maximum of 4 collectors. The default UDP port is 6343.

2. **Enable sFlow technology on a specific interface:**

   ```shell
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set interfaces ge-0/0/0
   ```

   Note: You cannot enable sFlow technology on a Layer 3 VLAN-tagged interface.

3. **Specify the polling interval:**

   ```shell
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set polling-interval 20
   ```

   Note: The polling interval can be specified as a global parameter. Specify 0 if you do not want to poll the interface.

4. **Specify the egress sampling rate:**

   ```shell
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set sample-rate egress 1000
   ```

   Note: You can specify both egress and ingress sampling rates. If you set only the egress sampling rate, the ingress sampling rate will be disabled.

5. **(Optional) Specify the sample size for the raw packet header:**

   ```shell
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set sample-size 135
   ```

   Note: This configuration is applicable on specific PTX Series devices from 23.1R1 Junos OS Evolved release.

#### Results

Check the results of the configuration:

```shell
[edit protocols sflow]
user@switch# show
polling-interval 20;
sample-rate egress 1000;
collector 10.204.32.46 {
    udp-port 5600;
}
interfaces ge-0/0/0.0;
```

#### Verification

##### Verifying That sFlow Technology Is Configured Properly

**Action:**

Use the `show sflow` command:

```shell
user@switch> show sflow
sFlow: Enabled
Sample limit: 300 packets/second
Polling interval: 20 seconds
Sample rate egress: 1:1000: Enabled
Sample rate ingress: 1:2048: Disabled
Agent ID: 10.204.96.222
```

##### Verifying That sFlow Technology Is Enabled on the Specified Interface

**Action:**

Use the `show sflow interface` command:

```shell
user@switch> show sflow interface
Interface Status Sample rate Adapted sample rate Polling-interval
Egress Ingress Egress Ingress Egress Ingress
ge-0/0/0.0 Enabled Disabled 1000 2048 1000 2048 20
```

##### Verifying the sFlow Collector Configuration

**Action:**

Use the `show sflow collector` command:

```shell
user@switch> show sflow collector
Collector Udp-port No. of samples
address
10.204.32.46 5600 1000
10.204.32.76 3400 1000
```

### sFlow Agent Address Assignment

The sFlow collector uses the sFlow agent’s IP address to determine the source of the sFlow data. You can configure the IP address of the sFlow agent to ensure that the agent ID remains constant. If not specified, the IP address is automatically assigned based on the following priority:

- **Routers and EX Series Switches:**
  1. Virtual Management Ethernet (VME) interface
  2. Management Ethernet interface

- **QFX Series Devices:**
  1. Management Ethernet interface em0 IP address
  2. Any Layer 3 interface if the em0 IP address is not available

If neither of the preceding interfaces has been configured, the IP address of any Layer 3 interface or the routed VLAN interface (RVI) is assigned to the agent. At least one interface must be configured on the switch for an IP address to be automatically assigned to the agent. When the agent’s IP address is assigned automatically, the IP address is dynamic and changes when the switch reboots.

sFlow data can be used to provide network traffic visibility information. You can explicitly configure the IP address to be assigned to source data (sFlow datagrams). If not explicitly configured, the IP address of the configured Gigabit Ethernet interface, 10-Gigabit Ethernet interface, or the RVI is used as the source IP address.
