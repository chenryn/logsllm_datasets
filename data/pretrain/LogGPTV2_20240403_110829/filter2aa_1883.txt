Background:
What is Urban Exploration?
Urban Exploration is the practice of discovering, exploring, 
and often photographing the more “off-beat” areas of 
human civilization.
“This hobby consists of a lot more than just poking about in 
abandoned buildings and storm drains and hanging out on 
web boards trying to impress people. Being an urban 
explorer is a whole way of looking at the world, where every 
ladder, door, window, grate and hole in the ground is a 
possible portal to adventure.”
- Jeff Chapman (“Ninjalicious”), 2004

The UrbEx Subculture
Jeff Chapman (“Ninjalicious”) coined “Urban 
Exploration” & operated the zine “Infiltration” 
from 1996 – 2005.
Several web communities have sprung up over 
the last ten years. 
UER.CA (mostly USA)
DegGi5.com (NE USA)
28dayslater.co.uk  (UK)
Others...
Explorers vs. Tourists vs. Scenesters
Birds of a Feather
What Urban Explorers and Computer Hackers have in common
Perspective
"Behind-the-scenes" view of the word
Ability to look at things abstractly
Willing to use non-standard entry points
Secrecy
Built around a subculture with counterculture tendencies 
Distrusting of newbies
Hesitant to allow outsiders in
Script Kiddies and Tourists
Gray Area Activities
Do you use your powers for good or for awesome?
Sense of "moral superiority" while engaging in legally 
questionable behavior
... the latest technology
(pwned)
Birds of a Feather
What Urban Explorers and Computer Hackers have in common
Frighteningly similar lack of fashion sense.
Black t-shirts are the shiznit, yo!
Social Engineering
Incredibly effective in UrbEx and Hacking
Higher stakes (walking away vs. county lock-up)
Exploitation by others
Taggers vs. Website Defacers
Scrappers vs. Phishers
Drug labs, gangs, and k1dd1e-pr0n collectors.

Urban Explorers != Graffiti Artists
... but we do get to see some cool graffiti
damage done by copper thieves (aka scrappers)
So you want to be an explorer...
Safety
This is a hobby.  We do it for fun.  Dying is not fun.
Off-limits areas do not have to meet safety codes.
Abandoned buildings may not be structurally sound.
Hazardous materials may be present.
Hazardous people  may be present.
In the basement of an abandoned building, no one can hear 
you scream.
Urban Exploring can be dangerous, even if you do 
everything right.
Structurally Sound?
Can you spot the warning signs?
How about here?
Safety: Rules to Live By
The "do list:"
Tell someone exactly where you are going, and check in later.
Carry a cellphone.
Carry as many flashlights as you need + 1. 
Be very wary of water-damaged floors.
Move slowly; look, then move.
Wear well fitting, covering clothing that you won't mind tearing.
Wear waterproof, sturdy shoes or boots
Consider whether gloves, a mask, or other safety equipment are 
appropriate.
Safety: Rules to Live By
The "don't list:"
Never explore alone.
Do not step/crawl/move where you can't see.
Do not put any body part you want to keep through a hole of jagged metal 
or broken glass.
Do not climb anything unsturdy.
Do not move while looking through a camera.
Do not let doors close behind you without checking their openability from 
both sides.
Do not touch, taste, or smell unusual substances to figure out what they 
are.
What's odd about this picture?
Oops...
Safety: Health Hazards
Asbestos
There is no known "safe level" of asbestos exposure
Mesothelioma develops > 10 years later
Deadly
Asphyxiation
Enclosed spaces
Subterranean spaces
Often, no indications of "bad air" until you pass out
Disease Exposure
Pigeon / Rat / Animal waste
Human Waste
Tetanus, Hepatitis A & B are all preventable with vaccines.
Chemical Exposure
PCBs, acids, toxic waste all may be present in industrial locations
Research the facility before you enter the premesis
Wear protective clothing or masks when appropriate.
"Investigation Derived Waste" ... yummy!
To proceed, or not to proceed...
Legality*
Trespass laws vary state by state.  Look up the local laws!
There is nothing wrong with getting permission!
Don't break the law!   Avoid:
Theft 
Vandalism 
Breaking and Entering 
Possession of Burglary Tools
The appearance  of any of the above
Disregarding these rules not only puts you at risk, but makes 
life harder for the "legitimate" explorers.
 *Disclaimer:  I am not a lawyer, and nothing in this presentation is intended to be legal advice.  If in doubt, consult an attorney.
No Lock Picks!

When to Never Trespass
We don't advocate trespassing.  That being stated, there are certainly 
some "gray areas" when it's hard to determine whether you are 
trespassing or not.  The following are not examples of those times.  
Do not trespass:
On or adjacent to airport property.  
On or adjacent to active US military property.
On active US Federal Government facilities or property.
On active infrastructure or utilities (waterworks, electricity, &etc) 
Very special consideration (or permission ) should be granted to:
Financial institution property, former military or government property, 
casino property , &etc.
This is not an all-inclusive list.  Use your head!
Some signs are to be taken seriously...
Stealth
Appearance
Dress to look convincing , not cool.
Walk & act "casual, but confident."
Credibility Props - coined by Ninjalicious. 
Alone vs. small groups vs. big groups
Be aware of your visibility and act accordingly.
Parking
What to do when confronted.
Introduce yourself first.
Be friendly and non-confrontational.
Offer to leave peacefully.
Oddly "I'm geocaching" is never  a better proposition.
Do No Harm
Subscribe to the Sierra Club motto: 
"Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints."
Vandalism or B&E increases your likelihood of criminal 
charges
Creating new or obvious points-of-entry (PoE) invites graffiti, 
theft, squatters, &etc.
Be respectful of property owners & future explorers by not 
changing anything.  
Life-cycle of an Abandonment
Secured
Boarded up windows
Chained doors
Locked Fences
Infiltrated
Break-in by scrappers, taggers, homeless, &etc
At least one Point of Entry (PoE)
PoE possibly concealed from view
Promiscuous
Accessibility well established
Multiple PoEs
Regular occupancy by taggers, homeless,
   teenagers, explorers
Rapid deterioration of site 
   (graffiti, trash, theft, &etc)
Incident
Injury, death, murder, or arrest made on site
Police involvement
Property owner contacted, cycle repeats.
Hmm.. how to get in...
Discovering Locations
Open your eyes!
Check likely areas of town for the types of facilities you are 
interested in.
Railroad tracks
Industrial Areas
Downtown Areas
Commercial Property Listings
Using the Internet
Google Earth / Satellite / Street View
Web searches.  (ugh.  I mean, really, do this last. )
Do not ask explorers online "Where is that location?"
akin to emailing someone from #hack and saying "Can I have a 0day 
for xyz?"

Q&A / Audience Stories
Thanks!    Enjoy DEFCON 16!
Love the quick profit, the annual raise, vacation with pay. 
Want more of everything ready-made. Be afraid, to know your 
neighbors and to die. And you will have a window in your head.
Not even your future will be a mystery any more. Your mind will be 
punched in a card and shut away in a little drawer. When they want 
you to buy something they will call you. When they want you to die 
for profit they will let you know.
So, friends, every day do something that won't compute.
