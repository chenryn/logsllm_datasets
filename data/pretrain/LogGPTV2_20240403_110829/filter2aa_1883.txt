## Background
### What is Urban Exploration?
Urban exploration (UrbEx) is the practice of discovering, exploring, and often photographing off-beat and unconventional areas of human civilization. As Jeff Chapman ("Ninjalicious") described in 2004:
> "This hobby consists of a lot more than just poking about in abandoned buildings and storm drains and hanging out on web boards trying to impress people. Being an urban explorer is a whole way of looking at the world, where every ladder, door, window, grate, and hole in the ground is a possible portal to adventure."

### What Do We Explore?
- **Civil Buildings**: Hospitals, schools, institutions
- **Industrial Buildings**: Factories, transportation facilities
- **Utilities & Infrastructure**: Steam tunnels, storm drains, utility corridors
- **Residential Areas**: Hotels, high-rises, houses, shanties

### Terminology
| **Hackers** | **Explorers** |
|-------------|---------------|
| leet, uber  | epic          |
| homeless person, bum | urban camper, hobo |
| script kiddie | tourist |
| exploit, 'sploit | PoE (point-of-entry) |

## The UrbEx Subculture
Jeff Chapman ("Ninjalicious") coined the term "Urban Exploration" and ran the zine "Infiltration" from 1996 to 2005. Several online communities have emerged over the years, including:
- UER.CA (primarily USA)
- DegGi5.com (Northeast USA)
- 28dayslater.co.uk (UK)
- And others...

### Explorers vs. Tourists vs. Scenesters
#### Birds of a Feather
**What Urban Explorers and Computer Hackers Have in Common:**
- **Perspective**: Both have a behind-the-scenes view and an ability to look at things abstractly.
- **Willingness**: To use non-standard entry points.
- **Secrecy**: Built around a subculture with counterculture tendencies, distrustful of newbies, and hesitant to allow outsiders in.
- **Gray Area Activities**: Engaging in legally questionable behavior while maintaining a sense of moral superiority.
- **Social Engineering**: Highly effective in both UrbEx and hacking, but with higher stakes.
- **Exploitation by Others**: Taggers vs. website defacers, scrappers vs. phishers, and other illegal activities.

### Safety
Urban exploration is a hobby, and safety is paramount. Dying is not fun. Off-limits areas do not meet safety codes, and abandoned buildings may be structurally unsound. Hazards include:
- Hazardous materials
- Hazardous people
- Enclosed and subterranean spaces with poor air quality
- Disease exposure (e.g., pigeon, rat, and animal waste, human waste, tetanus, hepatitis A & B)
- Chemical exposure (PCBs, acids, toxic waste)

#### Rules to Live By
- **Do List**:
  - Tell someone your exact location and check in later.
  - Carry a cellphone.
  - Bring multiple flashlights.
  - Be cautious of water-damaged floors.
  - Move slowly and carefully.
  - Wear protective clothing and sturdy footwear.
  - Consider using gloves, masks, or other safety equipment.

- **Don’t List**:
  - Never explore alone.
  - Avoid stepping or crawling where you can't see.
  - Do not put body parts through holes of jagged metal or broken glass.
  - Do not climb unstable structures.
  - Do not move while looking through a camera.
  - Do not let doors close behind you without checking if they can be opened from both sides.
  - Do not touch, taste, or smell unusual substances.

### Legality
Trespass laws vary by state. Always research local laws and consider getting permission. Avoid:
- Theft
- Vandalism
- Breaking and entering
- Possession of burglary tools
- Appearing to engage in any of the above

### When to Never Trespass
- Airport property
- Active US military property
- Active US Federal Government facilities
- Active infrastructure or utilities

Special consideration or permission should be obtained for:
- Financial institution property
- Former military or government property
- Casino property

### Stealth and Appearance
- Dress to blend in, not to stand out.
- Act casual and confident.
- Use credibility props.
- Be aware of your visibility and act accordingly.
- Know how to handle confrontations: introduce yourself, be friendly, and offer to leave peacefully.

### Do No Harm
- Follow the Sierra Club motto: "Take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints."
- Avoid vandalism or breaking and entering, as these increase the likelihood of criminal charges.
- Respect property owners and future explorers by not altering the site.

### Life Cycle of an Abandonment
1. **Secured**: Boarded-up windows, chained doors, locked fences.
2. **Infiltrated**: Break-ins by scrappers, taggers, and the homeless, creating points of entry.
3. **Promiscuous**: Multiple points of entry, regular occupancy, rapid deterioration.
4. **Incident**: Injury, death, murder, or arrest, leading to police involvement and property owner contact, restarting the cycle.

### Discovering Locations
- **Open Your Eyes**: Check likely areas such as railroad tracks, industrial zones, and downtown areas.
- **Use the Internet**: Google Earth, satellite and street views, and web searches.
- **Respect Privacy**: Do not ask explorers online for specific locations.

### Q&A / Audience Stories
Thank you! Enjoy DEFCON 16!

> "Love the quick profit, the annual raise, vacation with pay. Be afraid, to know your neighbors and to die. And you will have a window in your head. Not even your future will be a mystery any more. Your mind will be punched in a card and shut away in a little drawer. When they want you to buy something they will call you. When they want you to die for profit they will let you know. So, friends, every day do something that won't compute."
