The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: SecurityManager: authentication disabled; ui acls disabled; users with view permissions: Set(yarn, curi); users with modify permissions: Set(yarn, curi) 和 Slf4jLogger started
B: Remoting started; listening on addresses :[akka.tcp://<*>] 和 Reading broadcast variable <*> took <*> ms
C: Changing view acls to: <*> 和 Slf4jLogger started
D: Changing modify acls to: <*> 和 Starting remoting
