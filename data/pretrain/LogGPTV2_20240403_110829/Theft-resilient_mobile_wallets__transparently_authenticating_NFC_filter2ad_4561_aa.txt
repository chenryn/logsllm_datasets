ABSTRACT
The deployment of NFC technology on mobile phones is
gaining momentum, enabling many important applications
such as NFC payments, access control for building or pub-
lic transit ticketing. However, (NFC) phones are prone to
loss or theft, which allows the attacker with physical access
to the phone to fully compromise the functionality provided
by the NFC applications. Authenticating a user of an NFC
phone using PINs or passwords provides only a weak level
of security, and undermines the eﬃciency and convenience
that NFC applications are supposed to provide.
In this paper, we devise a novel gesture-centric NFC bio-
metric authentication mechanism that is fully transparent to
the user. Simply “tapping” the phone with the NFC reader
– anatural gesture already performed by the user prior to
making the NFC transaction – would unlock the NFC func-
tionality. An unauthorized user cannot unlock the NFC
functionality because tapping serves as a “hard-to-mimic”
biometric gesture unique to each user. We show how the
NFC tapping biometrics can be extracted in a highly ro-
bust manner using multiple – motion, position and ambi-
ent – phone’s sensors and machine learning classiﬁers. The
use of multiple sensors not only improves the authentication
accuracy but also makes active attacks harder since multi-
ple sensor events need to be mimicked simultaneously. Our
work signiﬁcantly enhances the security of NFC transactions
without adding any extra burden on the users.

services. A prime example of one such service, now getting
widely deployed on smartphones, is Near Field Communi-
cations (NFC). NFC allows the phone to communicate with
any other NFC device (an external contactless reader or an-
other NFC phone) when they are in close proximity, typ-
ically upon tapping to one another. This facilitates many
important applications in day-to-day life including payments
(using the phone essentially as a digital wallet), access con-
trol for buildings [6, 13, 43] and vehicles [8, 44], and public
transit ticketing [15, 18], to name a few. The NFC technol-
ogy, especially mobile payments, is already popular in many
countries (e.g., China and Japan) [25] and has been gaining
momentum in many other countries (e.g., the US). Intro-
duction of Apple Pay [3], Android Pay [2] and Samsung Pay
[37] have further boosted the growth of NFC payments.
Given the rise of NFC deployments, a natural concern
pertains to the security of NFC phones and NFC applica-
tions. One obvious and serious threat is that of loss or theft
of NFC phones – an unauthorized entity in physical posses-
sion of an NFC phone can fully compromise the NFC func-
tionality leading to severe consequences (e.g., making hefty
purchases on behalf of the user or entering the user’s oﬃce
premises). Given many current mobile users do not lock
their phones (e.g., with a PIN or pattern) [14], the abuse of
NFC services becomes a real threat. A report by Boyles et
al. [7] estimates that nearly one third of cell phone owners
have experienced a lost or stolen phone, and 12% have had
another person access the contents of their phone in a way
that made them feel their privacy was invaded. Consumer
Reports reported that 3.1 million smartphones were stolen
in 2013, nearly double the year before [9]. While Lookout re-
ported that 1 in 10 smartphone owners are victims of phone
theft from a survey conducted in 2014 [24].
To address this problem, many NFC apps (e.g., Google
Wallet) authenticate the user prior to making an NFC trans-
action with a PIN or password. This approach, however,
has two major problems. First, given PINs or passwords
are only short and weak secrets (especially in the context of
mobile phones with small form factors), they can be easily
guessed or brute-forced [1, 31, 48]. Second, typing in the
PIN or password for each NFC transaction can be tedious
and potentially annoying for the user, thereby signiﬁcantly
undermining the usability of NFC technology as it was in-
herently designed for easy and fast transactions [30, 45].
Given the rather poor security and usability oﬀered by
265
PINs/passwords for the purpose of NFC user authentica-
tion, we set out to investigate a fully transparent and hard
to compromise authentication mechanism. In short, we pro-
pose a transparent behavioral biometrics [21, 47] mechanism
drawn from the gesture involving the tapping of a phone
with a transaction terminal (e.g., an external NFC reader
at point of service) while completing an NFC transaction.
The tapping gesture is performed by the user prior to mak-
ing a purchase using an NFC phone anyway and therefore
no additional burden is required from the user in our ap-
proach. Our approach is not a general user authentication
mechanism, for example, to unlock the phone, but is a spe-
ciﬁc user authentication mechanism to authorize the NFC
transactions.
Our Contributions: The main contributions of this paper
are summarized below:
1. Transparent Authentication of NFC Users: We
show how the user’s phone tapping gesture naturally
exhibited during an NFC transaction can be uniquely
detected in a robust manner using multiple – motion,
position and ambient – sensors and machine learning
classiﬁers. Such a biometric authentication would be
very hard, if not impossible, for an attacker to compro-
mise as the attacker needs to mimic the victim user’s
subtle hand movement and phone orientations mea-
sured by multiple diﬀerent sensors. Thus, we believe
that our work signiﬁcantly enhances the security of
NFC phones without adding any extra burden on the
users.
2. Gesture Detection Design and Implementation:
We design and implement the NFC tapping gesture
detection biometrics as part of the proposed authenti-
cation mechanism. The NFC tapping gesture involves
holding the phone in hand, and tapping and holding
onto a NFC transaction terminal until the user is noti-
ﬁed about the transaction completed/denied message.
We extract multiple features from the phone’s diﬀerent
sensors when a user taps her phone to NFC transaction
terminal and implement machine learning approach to
identify if the sensor data corresponds to the owner of
the device (or not).
3. Experiments and Evaluation: To demonstrate the
eﬀectiveness of our approach, we have collected data
from multiple users in near real-life scenarios emulat-
ing typical NFC transaction settings, and report on
the overall accuracy of our authentication mechanism.
Our results show that NFC tapping biometrics can be
extracted with a high overall accuracy (92% on an
average), while it does not seem possible for even a
trained active attacker to succeed in mimicking the
tapping gesture of a victim user.
Paper Outline: The rest of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. In Section 2, we outline our system and threat model,
and our design goals.
In Section 3, we elaborate on our
approach including the underlying system architecture. In
Section 4, we describe the design of our app system. Next,
in Section 5, we report on our data collection procedures. In
Section 6, we present the design and evaluation results for
our NFC tap biometrics system. Finally, in Section 8, we
discuss other properties of our system, including resistance
to active attacks and NFC unauthorized reading.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 System and Threat Model
We assume that a user owns an NFC-enabled phone that
she uses to make NFC transactions with transaction termi-
nals for payments or public transit ticketing. As our pay-
ment device in this paper, we focus on an NFC-enabled
phone with an NFC transaction application. The trans-
action terminal accepts the payment when the owner taps
his/her phone to the reader. We assume that the phone is
only used by its owner and not shared with others.
In our threat model, we assume that the phone is in
the possession of an attacker. The attacker might have
stolen the device or could be performing a lunch-time at-
tack. Lunch-time attack [32] is an attack scenario where the
owner might have left the device in an oﬃce for a short time
during which the attacker can access the device and perform
malicious activities. In such a situation, the attacker would
have access to the device for a limited time. However, the
attacker has complete control over the device physically.
We assume that the phone’s OS kernel is healthy and the
attacker is unable to alter the kernel control ﬂow. Strength-
ening the kernel is an orthogonal problem [33, 39]. We also
assume that attacker cannot manipulate device’s onboard
sensor hardware. In other words, the attacker only has phys-
ical access to the device but does not have internal control
of the device.
The attacker attempts to make transactions by tapping
the stolen phone at an NFC transaction terminal. The NFC
terminal at the merchant side is not compromised. However,
the terminal is not aware of the fraudulent transaction. The
merchant will process the transaction in a normal fashion
as if the actual user is making the transaction. The goal
of our system is to prevent such an attacker from utilizing
the NFC transaction functionality when the attacker taps
the stolen phone to make transactions. We want to achieve
this transparently without involving additional eﬀort from
the NFC user other than tapping.
2.2 Design Goals
We consider following design goals for our authentication
approach to be useful in practice.
• Lightweight: The authentication mechanism should be
lightweight in terms of the various resources available
on the device, such as memory, computation and bat-
tery power.
• Eﬃcient: The approach should not incur high delay
aﬀecting the overall usability of the system. The entire
authentication process should be completed within few
seconds.
• Robust: The approach should have low error rates.
The owner of the device must be able to authenticate
to the phone with a high probability, while the impos-
tor should be denied access with a high probability.

Figure 1: Overview of our system. The user gets authenticated just based on the uniqueness of his tapping
gesture, a form of behavioral biometrics. The process is completely transparent to the user – no additional
work is needed beyond what is currently done in NFC systems.
• Consistency & Transparency: The approach should
not require the user to perform additional action while
making a transaction: when the user makes an NFC
transaction, she takes out her NFC-enabled phone,
opens an app for payment, taps the phone to the trans-
action terminal, holds the phone until the transaction
completes and removes her phone from the transaction
terminal. The approach should not alter this model,
thereby making the approach consistent and transpar-
ent to the users. The user should not be required
to perform additional actions such as explicit gestures
[23, 42] or passwords or PIN entry. Since these tasks
add burden to the users which may degrade usability
and, therefore, reduce chances of adoption.
3. OUR APPROACH: TAP BIOMETRICS
3.1 Background and Overview
Diﬀerent user authentication approaches have been used
based on “something you know”, “something you have” and
“something you are”. In this paper, we set forth to authen-
ticate users while they use the NFC applications based on
“something you are”. This approach has advantage over the
ﬁrst two approaches since people forget things (e.g., pass-
words) and lose things (e.g., access tokens). In other words,
our approach implements biometric authentication to au-
thenticate users. The biometric characteristics of an individ-
ual are believed to be easily measured accurately but hard
to impersonate by others. Such biometric characteristics
can again be classiﬁed into two diﬀerent categories, physi-
ological biometrics [20, 21] and behavioral biometrics [47].
In physiological biometrics, the authentication system uses
physiological features of the user such as her facial structure,
ﬁngerprint or retina pattern, whereas in behavioral biomet-
rics, the authentication system uses behavior of the user such
as her keyboard typing pattern, or walking pattern. Physio-
logical biometric authentication requires the user to perform
some explicit actions such as using camera for face recogni-
tion or scanning ﬁnger/retina/iris while behavioral biomet-
rics are usually transparent to the users and recognizes the
user implicitly. In this paper, we use behavioral biometric
characteristics to authenticate the user while she performs
a tapping gesture before completing an NFC transaction.
When a user makes an NFC transaction using her NFC-
enabled device (let’s say an NFC phone), she taps her phone
to the transaction terminal and holds it for a while. When
the transaction completes or gets interrupted, she removes
her phone away from the terminal. These steps are illus-
trated in Figure 1. Tapping a phone to an NFC transaction
terminal involves a particular motion of her phone which
can be measured using diﬀerent embedded sensors on the
phone. The motion sensors and the position sensors can
give us information about how the phone was moved. Also,
there may be signiﬁcant changes in the pressure as detected
by the device when moved. This can also be used to analyze
how the device was moved. We observe in Section 6 that the
features extracted from pressure sensor are indeed one of the
discriminating features for the machine-learning classiﬁers.
In this paper, we show that the tapping gesture performed
by a user before making NFC transactions is unique to the
user and can be detected in a robust manner using ma-
chine learning classiﬁers and multiple sensors available on

the phone.
In the following section, we will demonstrate
that our approach meets all of our design goals introduced
in the prior section.
In our model, we add another layer of a security check
on top of the default authentication system of Android and
that of an NFC transaction app. Android can authenticate
a user via diﬀerent options such as passwords, PINs, face
recognition, or ﬁngerprint scanner. However, many users do
not prefer to lock their phones. Also, using PINs or ﬁnger-
print scans for each transaction can be burdensome. These
mechanism require explicit action and is not transparent to
the users. We provide a way to authenticate the user before
making the transaction in a way that does not require any
explicit user action – just tapping the phone to the terminal
(as is done currently) is suﬃcient. Our approach is invis-
ible to users and requires no additional actions from the
users. Our approach accurately identiﬁes legitimate users
and prevents unauthorized NFC transactions.
It can also
work seamlessly with other authentication methods, such
as PINs or ﬁngerprint scans when used, to achieve strong
two-factor security.
3.2 System Architecture
Figure 2 depicts the control ﬂow for our approach. Our
system analyzes the collected sensor values and compares
with a pre-registered template of the user’s tapping gesture.
Our system grants permissions to complete NFC transac-
tions if and only if the sensor values match with the user’s
tapping gestures. Our system includes four modules: (1)
NFC Transaction App which provides the user interface and
handles NFC communication, (2) Transaction Processing
Module which processes the NFC transaction messages, (3)
Authenticator Module which is a trained classiﬁer that uniqu-
ely identiﬁes the user’s tapping gesture, and (4) Permission
Manager that reads the sensor values, communicates with
the Authenticator Module and grants the NFC Transaction
App with the permission to interact with the Transaction
Processing Module.
