**ATT&CK ID:** G0081  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Tropic Trooper

Tropic Trooper, a known threat actor, has employed the technique of creating shortcuts in the Startup folder to establish persistence on compromised systems. This method ensures that their malicious code is executed each time the system starts, thereby maintaining long-term access to the target. References for this behavior can be found in sources [264] and [265].
