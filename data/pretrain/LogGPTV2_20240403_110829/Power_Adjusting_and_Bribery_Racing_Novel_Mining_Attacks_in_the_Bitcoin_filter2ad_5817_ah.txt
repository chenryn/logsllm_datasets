the memorylessness property of exponential distributions, we

𝑔3(𝜏1, 𝜏2) = −𝜏2 (cid:54) 0;
𝑔4(𝜏1, 𝜏2) = 𝜏2 − 1 (cid:54) 0.
We further introduce four Lagrange multipliers 𝜆1, 𝜆2, 𝜆3,
and 𝜆4 (𝜆 = (𝜆1, 𝜆2, 𝜆3, 𝜆4)). The objective function of
Equation (19) can be constructed as a Lagrange function
ℒ(𝜏1, 𝜏2, 𝜆):
ℒ(𝜏1, 𝜏2, 𝜆) = − 𝑅𝑎(𝜏1, 𝜏2) − 𝜆1𝜏1 + 𝜆2(𝜏1 − 1)

tion when 𝜏1, 𝜏2 ∈ [0, 1] (the Hessian matrix is positive def-
inite), the optimal ̂︀𝜏1 and ̂︀𝜏2 can be found by solving the
KKT conditions.

victim pool under FAW attacks:

𝑝 increases with 𝑐 if 𝜏1 is fixed. When considering
𝑝 ,̂︀𝜏1 (¯𝜏 in [13]) becomes

need to involve 𝜕̂︀𝜏1
regarding 𝜕̂︀𝜏1
𝜕𝑐 when calculating
a function related to 𝑐 (Equation (2) in [13]). Therefore, we
𝜕𝑐 = 0.
We present a specific case to show 𝑅𝐹
𝑝 (𝜏1) decreases when
𝑐 increases in Fig. 15. In this case, we consider 𝛼 = 0.2 and
0 < 𝛽 (cid:54) 0.5. We use the RER of the victim pool under FAW
attacks to show the pool’s reward.
Fig. 15-a shows the same RER as in [13]. However, when
𝛽 is small (e.g. 𝛽 (cid:54) 0.02), victim pool’s reward decreases
with 𝑐. Furthermore, we “zoom in” the area when 𝛽 (cid:54) 0.1 in
Fig. 15-b. The decreasing is more clear. Actually, whether
the pool’s reward increases or decreases with 𝑐 is related to
𝛼 and 𝛽 (we do not show the expression here since it is too
complex).
D CALCULATION OF 𝑅[𝑖] IN A
TWO-POOL PAW GAME
We calculate the reward of Pool𝑖. Suppose an FPoW from
Pool1 is selected as the main chain. Pool1 can earn a profit via
innocent mining in five cases: (Case 1) Pool1’s innocent min-
ing finds an FPoW; (Case 2) Pool1’s infiltration mining (in
Pool2) first finds an FPoW and Pool1’s innocent mining then
finds another FPoW; (Case 3) Pool2’s infiltration mining (in
Pool1) first finds an FPoW and Pool1’s innocent mining then
finds another FPoW; (Case 4) three FPoWs found by Pool1’s
infiltration mining, Pool2’s infiltration mining, and Pool1’s
innocent mining in order; and (Case 5) three FPoWs found by
Pool2’s infiltration mining, Pool1’s infiltration mining, and
Pool1’s innocent mining in order.
The reward of Pool1 in the five cases are:

We further consider Pool1’s reward of causing a fork when
an FPoW from Pool1 is selected as the main chain. Specifi-
cally, we have three cases: (Case 6) Pool2’s infiltration mining
(in Pool1) first finds an FPoW, and other miners then find a
valid block; (Case 7) three FPoWs found by Pool1’s infiltra-
tion mining, Pool2’s infiltration mining, and other miners in
order; and (Case 8) three FPoWs found by Pool2’s infiltra-
tion mining, Pool1’s infiltration mining, and other miners in
