User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why are my config settings inherited to the subdomain server block? I use nginx with a ssl wildcard certificate like that:

/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example.com

server {
    listen      443 default_server ssl;
    server_name 192.168.0.1 example.com;

    include /etc/nginx/ssl.conf;

    error_log   /var/log/nginx/example.com.error.ssl.log;
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/example.com.access.ssl.log;

    root /var/www/example.com/;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        alias /var/www/example.com/example.com/;
    }
}

server {
    listen      80;
    server_name 192.168.0.1 example.com;
    return      301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}


/etc/nginx/ssl.conf

The included ssl.conf looks like this:

ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com/example.com.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com/example.com.key;

ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com/example.com_dhparam.pem;
ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
ssl_ciphers 'AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000; includeSubDomains";
add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;
resolver 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8 valid=300s;
resolver_timeout 10s;


My server block for the subdomain looks like this:

/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/blog.example.com

server {
    listen      443;
    server_name blog.example.com;

    error_log   /var/log/nginx/blog.example.com.error.ssl.log;
    access_log  /var/log/nginx/blog.example.com.access.ssl.log;

    root /var/www/blog.example.com/;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:2368/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_buffering off;
        autoindex  off;
    }
}

server {
    listen      80;
    server_name blog.example.com;
    return      301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}


https on the subdomain works fine but I'd like to know why it's working and why blog.example.com is inheriting the settings from example.com even though the ssl.conf isn't included in that server block.

I couldn't find anything in the nginx documentation about inheriting settings from default_server.

Is it just the expected behaviour with a wildcard certificate?

Thanks!

Assistant: Even though you don't show the main nginx.conf I suspect that your ssl.conf is included in the http level in nginx configuration.

Practically all http level settings are inherited to server blocks in nginx. See http://blog.martinfjordvald.com/2012/08/understanding-the-nginx-configuration-inheritance-model/ for more information on how directive inheritance works in nginx.
