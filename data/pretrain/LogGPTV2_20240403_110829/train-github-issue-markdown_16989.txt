When running the following query:
    FOREACH ( n0 IN [] | CREATE ()<-[x:A]-(), ({n1:endNode(x).n2}) )
I encountered the following error:
    Neo4jError: Neo.DatabaseError.Statement.ExecutionFailed (Index 3 out of bounds for length 0)
I believe the query mentioned above is semantically and syntactically correct
and thus no error should be thrown here.
I encountered this issue when testing queries against the **Neo4j 5.6.0
enterprise version** in a Docker container running **alpine v.3**.  
While the error message is similar to the one from #13129, this bug only
arises in the enterprise edition, while the one from the mentioned issue only
triggers in the community edition.
### Steps to reproduce
Run the following queries and observe it throws an error:
    FOREACH ( n0 IN [] | CREATE ()<-[x:A]-(), ({n1:endNode(x).n2}) )
### Expected behavior
The query should run successfully
### Actual behavior
The query fails with the error message `Neo4jError:
Neo.DatabaseError.Statement.ExecutionFailed (Index 3 out of bounds for length
0)`
