  * OpenCV => 4.5.1
  * Operating System / Platform =>ubuntu20.04
  * Compiler => gcc-8.4  
I compiled clfft by myself, and library located in /usr/local/lib64, and I
have add this directory to CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH in opencv toplevel
CMakeLists.txt, I found clfftInitSetupData class in the clfft source code? so
what's wrong?  
does my compile flag wrong when I compile clfft? or wrong gcc version?
