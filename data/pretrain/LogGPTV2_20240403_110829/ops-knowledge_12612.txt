User: I need to implement a chat application for my web service (that is written in Django + Rest api framework). After doing some google search, I found that Django chat applications that are available are all deprecated and not supported anymore. And all the DIY (do it yourself) solutions I found are using Tornado or Twisted framework. 
So, My question is: is it OK to make a Django-only based synchronous chat application? And do I need to use any asynchronous framework? I have very little experience in backend programming, so I want to keep everything as simple as possible.
Assistant: You certainly can develop a synchronous chat app, you don't necessarily need to us an asynchronous framework. but it all comes down to what do you want your app to do? how many people will use the app? will there be multiple users and multiple chats going on at the same time?
