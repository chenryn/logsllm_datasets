User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Mysql replication using drbd and heartbeat I am setting up a backup server for an already existing Ubuntu server setup.

I'm running DRBD (protocol C) together with heartbeat, which is configured so that in case of an error the MySQL5 Server on the backup server starts.

I want to start the mysql server after replication using drbd and heartbeat.

I changed the datadir in my.cnf file and in apparmor.d/usr.bin.mysqld also.

Mysql starts when drbd device is not mounted.

My logs shows as follows:

Any help appreciated.

Assistant: The question is poorly written and confusing to understand what the actual symptoms are.

When using heartbeat to stop/start processes, it is important to also go through and change the default services. MySQL should not start on server boot. The DRBD should not on boot. These actions should be controlled by heartbeat and not normal /etc/rc?.d init scripts.

To troubleshoot further, add some up/down scripts in heartbeat to log what the system is doing when switching between master and backup states.
