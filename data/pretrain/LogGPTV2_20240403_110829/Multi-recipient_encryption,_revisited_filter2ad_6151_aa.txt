**Abstract:**
Multi-recipient public key encryption (MR-PKE) is a variant of public key encryption that offers efficiency gains through batch processing. In MR-PKE, a dedicated encryption routine takes a vector of messages and a vector of public keys and outputs a vector of ciphertexts, which can be individually decrypted as in regular PKE.

In this paper, we revisit the established security notions for MR-PKE and the related primitive, multi-recipient key encapsulation mechanism (MR-KEM). We identify a subtle flaw in a security model by Bellare, Boldyreva, and Staddon, which also appears in subsequent publications by other authors. Additionally, we observe that these security models rely on the knowledge-of-secret-key (KOSK) assumption, a requirement that is rarely met in practice. To address this, we propose strengthened security notions for MR-PKE and MR-KEM, along with correspondingly secure and efficient schemes. Our models do not restrict the set of considered adversaries and do not require the KOSK setting. We prove our constructions secure under the hardness of the static Diffie-Hellman problem, in the random oracle model.

## 1. Introduction

Standard public key encryption (PKE) involves two communicating parties: a sender and a receiver. The sender encrypts a confidential message for the receiver using the latter's public key. If a sender wants to encrypt the same or different messages for multiple receivers, a standard PKE scheme requires the sender to encrypt each message independently under each receiver's public key.

In contrast, a multi-recipient multi-message public key encryption scheme (MR-MM-PKE) allows a sender to simultaneously encrypt many messages for many receivers in a single operation. Specifically, an MR-MM-PKE scheme provides an encryption algorithm that, given a vector of public keys \((pk_1, \ldots, pk_n)\) and a corresponding vector of messages \((m_1, \ldots, m_n)\), returns a vector of ciphertexts \((c_1, \ldots, c_n)\). Each ciphertext \(c_i\) can be decrypted individually by the corresponding receiver \(i\) (holding the public/private key pair \((pk_i, sk_i)\)) without knowledge of the other public keys or ciphertexts.

By processing messages for multiple receivers simultaneously, MR-MM-PKE schemes can offer computational and, in some settings, bandwidth savings compared to the parallel use of standard PKE. This property is particularly attractive in applications where batch processing of encryptions naturally occurs, such as an online banking system sending encrypted account statements to all customers.

### 1.1 Evolution of MR-MM-PKE

A promising approach to constructing efficient MR-MM-PKE schemes is to use an ordinary encryption scheme to encrypt messages for their respective receivers but to use the same randomness for all encryptions. This can significantly reduce the computational requirements for the encryption process, provided the used encryption scheme remains secure under randomness reuse.

Kurosawa [13] shows that both ElGamal encryption [11] and a version of Cramer-Shoup encryption [8] are secure in this setting, providing a reduction of almost 50% in computational cost compared to individual encryptions. However, the security model used in [13] does not account for malicious receivers, leading to weak security guarantees in practice.

Bellare, Boldyreva, and Staddon [5] introduced a strengthened security model that explicitly considers insider attacks by allowing the adversary to provide some public keys used in the encryption, but requiring the adversary to reveal the corresponding secret keys (KOSK assumption). This assumption is rarely met in practice, and we discuss in Section 3.2 that multi-recipient ElGamal encryption is trivially breakable in the non-KOSK setting.

### 1.2 Our Contributions

We first revisit the security notion for MR-MM-PKE as defined by Bellare et al. [5] and identify a subtle technical flaw. Specifically, the challenge ciphertext in their model is always produced with honest public keys prefixed, making it possible to define an insecure MR-MM-PKE scheme that is secure in their model. Furthermore, their model does not allow repetition of honest public keys, leading to security issues when the sender encrypts more than one message for a given receiver.

We address these issues by further strengthening the model and dropping the KOSK assumption. We argue that MR-MM-PKE schemes should achieve the level of security captured by this new model. To find stronger instantiations of MR-MM-PKE, we introduce the notion of multi-recipient multi-key key encapsulation mechanism (MR-MK-KEM). By combining this KEM with an appropriate data encapsulation mechanism (DEM), we obtain an MR-MM-PKE scheme.

We show that the 'hashed ElGamal' technique combined with randomness reuse gives rise to a secure MR-MK-KEM and, consequently, to a secure MR-MM-PKE scheme. This scheme is efficient and provides compact ciphertexts, reducing the ciphertext size and computational cost by approximately 50% compared to the parallel use of the original hashed ElGamal scheme. Despite providing stronger security guarantees and not limiting the sender to encrypt the same message for all receivers, our scheme is as efficient as the best known MR-PKE scheme for single messages.

### 1.3 Related Work

Research on multi-recipient encryption was initiated by Kurosawa [13], who defined the first security model for MR-MM-PKE schemes and proposed randomness-reusing constructions based on ElGamal and Cramer-Shoup encryption. Bellare et al. [5] improved this work by introducing a stronger security model and describing a general transformation from reproducible encryption schemes to MR-MM-PKE schemes.

Smart [15] introduced the concept of multi-recipient key encapsulation (MR-KEM), closely related to MR-PKE due to the hybrid approach for obtaining public key encryption. Smart only considered single-key MR-KEMs, which establish the same session key for all recipients and are useful for constructing multi-recipient single-message public key encryption (MR-SM-PKE) schemes. Barbosa and Farshim [3] extended MR-KEM results to the identity-based setting, while Baek, Safavi-Naini, and Susilo [2] constructed a single-key MR-KEM in the identity-based setting. Chatterjee and Sarkar [7] constructed multi-recipient single-key identity-based KEMs that do not require the random oracle heuristic.

Broadcast encryption [12, 14, 6] is closely related to MR-SM-PKE, allowing a sender to encrypt a message for any subset of recipients in a predefined universe. However, broadcast encryption requires a central authority, whereas MR-SM-PKE allows users to generate their own public/private keys. The more general MR-MM-PKE is not comparable to broadcast encryption as it supports encrypting different messages to the recipients.

## 2. Preliminaries

### 2.1 Notation

We use \([n]\) to denote \(\{1, \ldots, n\}\) and arrow notation for vectors (e.g., \(\vec{a} = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)\) if \(n = |\vec{a}|\)). For a finite set \(A\), \(a \leftarrow_R A\) denotes sampling \(a\) uniformly from \(A\). If \(A\) is an algorithm, \(a \leftarrow_R A^O(x)\) assigns \(a\) the outcome of an execution of \(A\) on input \(x\) with uniformly picked random coins and oracle access to \(O\). In experiments and algorithms, "Require X" is a shortcut for "Return \(\bot\) unless X".

### 2.2 Static Diffie-Hellman Assumption

We recall the cyclic group setting and the static Diffie-Hellman assumption.

**Definition 1 (Group generator):** A group generator \(G\) is an efficient algorithm that, on input security parameter \(1^\lambda\), returns the description of an efficient prime-order group \(G\). We assume that the group order \(p\) and a distinguished generating element \(g \in G\) are part of this description. We use the notation \((G, p, g) \leftarrow_R G(1^\lambda)\) accordingly.

**Definition 2 (Static Diffie-Hellman assumption):** Let \(G\) be a group generator. The advantage of an algorithm \(A\) in solving the static Diffie-Hellman problem with respect to \(G\) is defined as:

\[
\text{Adv}_{G, A}^{\text{SDH}}(\lambda) = \Pr \left[ Z \leftarrow_R A^{O_u, O_v}(G, p, g, g^u, g^v) : Z = g^{uv} \right]
\]

where \(O_u(\cdot, \cdot)\) and \(O_v(\cdot, \cdot)\) are decisional oracles that return 1 if and only if \(X^u = Y\) and \(X^v = Y\), respectively. The probability is taken over the random coins used to sample \(u\) and \(v\) and those consumed by \(G\) and \(A\). The static Diffie-Hellman assumption holds with respect to \(G\) if for all efficient algorithms \(A\), the advantage function \(\text{Adv}_{G, A}^{\text{SDH}}(\lambda)\) is negligible in \(\lambda\).

### 2.3 Data Encapsulation Mechanisms

The concept of hybrid encryption and the related notion of data encapsulation were first introduced in [9]. We recall the definition and one of the possible security definitions.

**Definition 3 (Data encapsulation mechanism):** A data encapsulation mechanism (DEM) \(D = (K, \text{DEM}, \text{DEM}^{-1})\) consists of a keyspace \(K = \{0, 1\}^{l(\lambda)}\), for a polynomial \(l\) in the security parameter, and two efficient algorithms as follows:

- \(\text{DEM}(K, m)\): On input a key \(K \in K\) and a message \(m \in \{0, 1\}^*\), this algorithm returns a ciphertext \(c\).
- \(\text{DEM}^{-1}(K, c)\): On input a key \(K \in K\) and a ciphertext \(c\), this algorithm returns either a message \(m\) or the error symbol \(\bot\).

A DEM is correct if for all \(K \in K\) and all \(m \in \{0, 1\}^*\), we have \(\text{DEM}^{-1}(K, \text{DEM}(K, m)) = m\).

**Definition 4 (One-time CCA security):** A DEM \(D = (K, \text{DEM}, \text{DEM}^{-1})\) is said to be indistinguishable against a one-time chosen ciphertext attack (IND-OT-CCA) if for all efficient adversaries \(A = (A_1, A_2)\) interacting in the experiments \(\text{Expt}_{\text{IND-OT-CCA}, b}^D\) from Figure 1, the following advantage function is negligible in \(\lambda\):

\[
\left| \Pr \left[ \text{Expt}_{\text{IND-OT-CCA}, 1}^D \Rightarrow 1 \right] - \Pr \left[ \text{Expt}_{\text{IND-OT-CCA}, 0}^D \Rightarrow 1 \right] \right|
\]

This completes the preliminary definitions and sets the stage for the detailed analysis and construction of secure MR-MM-PKE schemes in the subsequent sections.
