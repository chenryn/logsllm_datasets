For working with the "Edit" button in Google App Engine Launcher on a Mac, it's important to choose an editor that can handle Python and YAML files, as well as open entire directories. Two highly recommended options are TextWrangler (now known as BBEdit) and jEdit. Both of these editors are versatile, supporting multiple programming languages and providing a range of useful features for developers.

- **BBEdit (formerly TextWrangler)**: This is a powerful text editor specifically designed for macOS. It offers robust support for various file types, including Python and YAML. BBEdit also includes syntax coloring, auto-completion, and the ability to open and navigate through entire project directories. You can download it from the official Bare Bones Software website or the Mac App Store.

- **jEdit**: This is a free, open-source text editor that is highly extensible and customizable. It supports a wide range of programming languages, including Python and YAML. jEdit also allows you to open and work with directories, making it a good choice for managing larger projects. You can find jEdit on its official website or by searching for it online.

Both of these editors are well-regarded in the development community and should meet your needs effectively.
