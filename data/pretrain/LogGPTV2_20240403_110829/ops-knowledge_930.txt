User: What editors are best for use with the "Edit" button in GoogleAppEngineLauncher for Mac? A good editor would preferably be able to edit Python and YAML and be able to open directories.
Assistant: Have you tried TextWrangler or jEdit? You can get the links to them on Apple site or you can google for them. They are pretty good editors.
