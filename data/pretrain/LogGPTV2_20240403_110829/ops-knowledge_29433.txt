User: Provide a solution to ensure high availability (High Availability) of the system, and explain how to use Nginx and Keepalived to achieve load balancing.
Assistant: The solution to ensure high availability of the system usually adopts a distributed system architecture to ensure that the system services can run normally even if a single node crashes or the request to the distributed node reaches an extremely high peak. A common solution is to build a load balancing cluster to distribute requests to different nodes through load balancing to achieve high availability. Below we will introduce how to use Nginx and Keepalived to achieve load balancing. 1. Introduction to Nginx Nginx is a high-performance HTTP and reverse proxy server that can handle high concurrent requests well. Nginx can quickly respond to client requests through multi-process and asynchronous event processing mechanisms, and supports advanced functions such as reverse proxy, load balancing, caching, and SSL encryption. 2. Introduction to Keepalived Keepalived is a high-availability software that can be used to monitor the online status of servers and forward requests to available servers. Keepalived judges whether it is running normally by detecting the status of the server, and can automatically transfer the request to the standby server when the server is abnormal. Keepalived also supports the VRRP protocol, which can combine multiple servers into one virtual IP address to achieve high-availability load balancing. 3. Use Nginx and Keepalived to achieve load balancing Before using Nginx and Keepalived to achieve load balancing, we need to install and configure Nginx and Keepalived: 3.1. Install and configure Nginx You can use package management tools to install Nginx on Linux systems, and Ubuntu systems For example: sudo apt-get install nginx After the installation is complete, we need to modify the configuration file of Nginx to achieve load balancing. We can add the upstream command to the Nginx configuration file to define the IP address and port number of the backend server. For example: upstream backend { server 192.168.1.10:80; server 192.168.1.11:80; } The above configuration indicates that the request will be allocated to the servers with IP addresses 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.1.11, and the port number is 80. We also need to define the listening port and reverse proxy in the server directive. For example: server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } } The above configuration means that Nginx listens to port 80 and forwards the request to the server defined in the upstream command. 3.2. Install and configure Keepalived On the Linux system, you can use the package management tool to install Keepalived. Take the Ubuntu system as an example: sudo apt-get install keepalived After the installation is complete, we need to modify the configuration file of Keepalived to achieve load balancing. We can define the virtual IP address and VRRP protocol in the configuration file. For example: vrrp_script check_nginx { script "/bin/pidof nginx" interval 2 weight -20 } vrrp_instance VI_1 { interface eth0 virtual_router_id 51 priority 100 advert_int 1 authentication { auth_type PASS auth_pass mypassword } virtual_ipaddres s { 192.168.1.100 } track_script { check_nginx } } The above configuration Indicates that the virtual IP address is defined as 192.168.1.100, the VRRP virtual route ID is 51, and it will detect whether the Nginx process is started. If the Nginx process is not started, it will transfer the virtual IP address to the backup server. 4. Conclusion Through the above configuration, we can realize the load balancing and high availability functions of Nginx and Keepalived to ensure the high availability of the system. When the main server fails, Keepalived will automatically transfer the request to the backup server to ensure the normal operation of the system.
