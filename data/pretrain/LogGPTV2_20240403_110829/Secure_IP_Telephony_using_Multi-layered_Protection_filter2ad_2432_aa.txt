**Abstract:**
This paper presents the design and analysis of a multi-layer protection scheme against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in IP telephony-enabled enterprise networks. We focus on flood-based attacks using application and transport layer signaling messages in IP telephony. We design sensors to detect and control these types of attacks and consider different sensor placements within the enterprise network. The detection algorithm is based on the well-established non-parametric cumulative sum method. The response to an attack uses standard protocol features of IP telephony to control the number of incoming application and transport layer setup requests. We evaluate different recovery algorithms using our emulation toolkit and show that the detection algorithm can quickly detect both transport and application layer attacks and is robust against various types of attacks. Additionally, with proper sensor parameters, the detection algorithm is effective over a wide range of call volumes.

**1. Introduction**

Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks have evolved over the past decade, targeting not just infrastructure but also specific services such as email and web [5]. As new complex services like IP telephony gain momentum, they become prime targets for DoS attacks. To support IP telephony, enterprise networks must deploy new elements and modify existing ones, introducing potential vulnerabilities. This paper examines the required architectural changes and associated vulnerabilities, focusing on flood-based attacks using signaling and control messages. We design transport and application layer sensors to detect and control these attacks, and we use an IP telephony emulation tool to evaluate their performance.

**2. IP Telephony-Enabled Enterprise Networks**

Enterprise networks typically consist of two sections: the internal network and the DMZ (demilitarized zone). The DMZ, connected to the public Internet through an external firewall, contains servers accessible from external locations, such as web, mail, and DNS servers. The internal network is connected to the DMZ by another firewall. Enabling IP telephony requires additional devices, including SIP Proxy, Registrar/Location Server (RLS), and Media/Signal Gateway (MSG), as well as modifications to the firewall.

- **SIP Proxy:** Placed in the DMZ, it routes all IP telephony signaling and control messages.
- **Registrar/Location Server (RLS):** Maintains the location of end users and communicates with other RLSs.
- **Media/Signal Gateway (MSG):** Connects the IP network to the PSTN, providing control and data message conversion.
- **Firewall Modifications:** A dynamic firewall capable of intelligently parsing all layers of the network stack is required.
- **DNS Extensions:** Support for ENUM is necessary for PSTN-to-Net and Net-to-PSTN calls.

**3. Normal IP Telephony Call Setup Sequences**

Understanding normal call setup sequences is essential for detecting DoS attacks, which are characterized by message sequences significantly different from these norms.

- **PSTN-to-Net Call:** Involves the MSG translating E.164 numbers to IP addresses and establishing an IP telephony connection.
- **Net-to-PSTN Call with Called Party Unavailable:** The MSG follows the SS7 call setup sequence and translates SS7 messages into SIP responses.
- **Incoming Net-to-Net Call:** The firewall plays an active role only during the initial TCP SYN packet, after which it does not interfere with the call setup.

**4. Classification of DoS Attacks in IP Telephony**

We classify DoS attacks based on the mechanisms that can be used to mitigate them. Our focus is on flood-based attacks using signaling and control messages.

**5. Design of Transport and Application Layer Sensors**

We design transport and application layer sensors to detect and control flood-based attacks. The detection algorithm is based on the non-parametric cumulative sum method, and the response uses standard IP telephony protocols to control incoming setup requests. Sensor placement is crucial and impacts the recovery algorithm.

**6. Performance Analysis**

Using an IP telephony emulation tool, we evaluate the performance of the sensors under various attack scenarios and recovery algorithms. Our results show that the detection algorithm is robust and effective across a wide range of call volumes.

**7. Deployment Considerations**

We discuss additional deployment issues, including the optimal placement of sensors and the impact on network performance.

**8. Related Work**

A review of related work in the field of IP telephony security and DoS attack mitigation.

**9. Conclusion**

We summarize the key findings and discuss future research directions, emphasizing the importance of multi-layered protection in securing IP telephony against DoS attacks.
