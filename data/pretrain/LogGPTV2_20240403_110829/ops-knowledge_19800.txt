- The logs document the Windows Update Agent initializing multiple sessions.
- Each session is identified by a unique session ID.
- The CBS component reads out the cached package applicability for various packages.
- For most packages, the ApplicableState and CurrentState are both 112, indicating that the packages are applicable and already installed or ready to be installed.
- One package (`Package_for_KB2703157~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0`) has an ApplicableState of 80 and a CurrentState of 0, suggesting it is not yet applicable or installed.
