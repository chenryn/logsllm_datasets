Plug For Plug-Ins 
Burning oil-based fuels, in addition to its political 
and economic problems, is the single largest 
contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The 
interim strategy of increasing fuel efficiency of 
gasoline powered cars relies on a continuing 
commitment to gasoline. In parallel, strategies are 
needed for reducing dependency on fossil fuel. a 
range of approaches will do this. Electric cars 
provide unique opportunities in this regard, as they 
can be powered by solar, wind or almost any other 
form of renewable energy.  
Why would converting the entire U.S. auto fleet add 
so little to electric consumption? The key is the 
greater efficiency of the electric motor. According to 
Chevron engineers, the current internal combustion 
car only delivers 13% of the fuel energy from the 
motor to the wheel. A recent report by US traffic 
engineers discovered that 10% of the remaining 
energy is wasted waiting for traffic lights.  In 
contrast, 85% of the energy stored in an EV’s 
batteries is delivered to the wheels, and no energy 
loss while stopped in traffic.

movement 
Many people have decided they won’t wait for the 
automakers to come up with an affordable, true 100% 
electric car.  These people have been converting gas-engine 
“donor cars” to all-electric themselves for 40 years.  There 
are many companies in the U.S. that sell conversion kits 
custom designed for specific popular car and truck models, 
or generic kits that the hobbyist can custom fit easily into 
any vehicle.

Electric Cars: 
The Future is Here! 
“Starve a terrorist,  
drive an electric car” 
No noise, no smog, no gas, no kidding! 
A Case for Electricity 
Until the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt are introduced 
into the market, home conversion is the only game in 
town if you want something affordable and bigger than a 
clown car.  Thousands of EV conversions are under 
construction or completed by consumers, because of the 
rarity of assembly line EVs in the USA. Hopefully this 
situation will soon be remedied. 
7 out of 10 EVs on the road today are home-built. The 
remaining 30% are legacy vehicles from the past four 
decades that have demonstrated their reliability, safety, 
durability and roadworthiness. 
What are Plug-ins? 
In an all-electric car, high performance batteries store cleaner, cheaper, domestically produced electricity, and an 
electric motor provides propulsion with zero emissions. In a plug-in hybrid, more batteries than a conventional 
hybrid allow local all-electric, zero-emission driving with an internal combustion engine for longer distances. 
Electric cars are very reliable. No oil changes, no tune ups. EVs have fewer than 1/10th as many parts as a gas 
car.  There's no engine, transmission, spark plugs, distributor, valves, fuel tank, tailpipe, starter, clutch, muffler or 
catalytic converter. 
1. The near-term goal of true zero-emission driving 
can only be achieved with electricity into 
batteries, with renewably generated electricity 
(solar, wind, hydro). 
2. Electricity generation and distribution is publicly 
regulated.  Public and citizen involvement in 
pricing and rule-making is not possible with 
petroleum or bio-fuels. 
3. Cost per mile will always be cheaper with 
electricity. 
4. Of all the alternative transportation fuels, only 
electricity is infrastructure-ready. 
5. Improvements in energy density and price 
reductions for advanced batteries are evidence of 
what is achievable with large format car batteries.  
Even without massive investment from 
government, advanced batteries for cars 
have developed far more rapidly than fuel 
cell/hydrogen technology. 
6. Plug-in hybrids and electric cars offer a 
difference in kind rather than degree.  As 
long as the market only offers gasoline 
vehicles of varying efficiencies rated in 
mpg, the choice for consumers is always the 
same. 
7. Running a gasoline powered car costs 8 
times as much for gasoline (at today’s 
prices) vs. the electricity to run an EV. 
Politics and the power of entrenched economic interests 
aside, the best way to reduce carbon emissions is to utilize 
the ever cleaner, greener and renewable grid to power 
transportation.  Only grid-rechargeable cars can attain the 
end goal of zero-emissions and ensure fuel price stability.
