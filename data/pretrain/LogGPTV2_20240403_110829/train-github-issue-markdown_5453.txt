Hello,

I encountered an issue when attempting to cast an object to a method. Although this is typically handled automatically using an `if-else` block (kudos to the developers who implemented this), it does not seem to work within a `switch` statement or when done manually. Below is the code that reproduces the error:

```java
// Your code here
```

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue or suggest an alternative approach?

Thank you.
