User: I am trying to run simple python code in atom using atom-runner package, but I am getting following error:

Unable to find command: python
Are you sure PATH is configured correctly?

How can I configure PATH. (path to my python is C:\Python34)
Assistant: If this does not work guys uninstall Python and Atom. While reinstalling Python make sure you click on "Add Python to Path" so you will not have any problems with setting the paths at all!
