User: How to use different branches for development and merging when using Git for version control? Please list commonly used Git commands, such as branch, checkout, merge, etc., and briefly describe their functions and usage.
Assistant: Git branching is a very important concept that allows developers to add and test new features without breaking the mainline code. The following are commonly used Git commands and their corresponding functions and usage methods: 1. branch command: This command is used to view all branches of the current warehouse and create new branches. - List all branches: `$ git branch` - Create a new branch: `$ git branch new_branch_name` 2. checkout command: This command is used to switch branches or create a new branch and switch to this branch, and can also be used to undo changes. - Switch branches: `$ git checkout branch_name` - Create and switch branches: `$ git checkout -b new_branch_name` - Undo changes: `$ git checkout file_name` or `$ git checkout .` (Undo all changes) 3. merge command : This command is used to merge a branch into the current branch. - Merge branches: `$ git merge branch_name` - Merge branches in automatic merge mode (prompt if there are conflicts): `$ git merge --no-ff branch_name` - Merge branches in non-quick merge mode (create A new merge commit): `$ git merge --no-ff -m "merge message" branch_name` In addition to the above commonly used Git commands, there are some other commands, such as stash (save the current modification), cherry-pick (select A commit applied to the current branch), rebase (transplant changes in one branch to another branch), etc., they are also often used in branch development.
