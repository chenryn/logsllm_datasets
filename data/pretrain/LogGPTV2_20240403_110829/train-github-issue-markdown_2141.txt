If a playbook is written to include a dependency role explicitly, that role
can be loaded more than once if another role depends on it. Consider this
example. `base` is a role with no dependencies. `feature` is a role with a
meta/main.yml file specifying the `base` role as a dependency. `base` will be
run twice by default here.
    - name: name
      roles:
        - base
        - feature
The docs say "by default, roles can also only be added as a dependency once"
and technically that is true, `base` is loaded once as an explicit module and
once as a dependency module. Still, I argue that this behavior should be
improved to "by default, roles are added only once" to be more consistent with
typical dependency management systems and associated expectations. When
`feature` is run, it should be known that the `base` dependency has already
run.
