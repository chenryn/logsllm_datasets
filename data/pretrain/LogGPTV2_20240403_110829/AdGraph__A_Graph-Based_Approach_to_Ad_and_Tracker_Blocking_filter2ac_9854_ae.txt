### Breakdown of Breakage Analysis Results

**Table VII: Breakdown of Breakage Analysis Results (Columns represent the average of two independent scores)**

- **Crash Rate:**
  - ADGRAPH: 2.3%
  - Filter Lists: 1.4%

- **Breakage Rate:**
  - ADGRAPH: 6.8% (2.5)
  - Filter Lists: 3.6% (1.5)

- **No Breakage:**
  - ADGRAPH: 93.5%
  - Filter Lists: 97.5%

**Results:**

Table VII presents the site breakage assessments, which are the average of two reviewers. The evaluation indicates that both ADGRAPH and filter lists are comparable in terms of site breakage. Specifically:
- ADGRAPH does not cause any breakage on 85.0% of the sites.
- Filter lists do not cause any breakage on 88.6% of the sites.
- The major breakage rate for ADGRAPH is 5.9%, which is on par with the filter lists at 6.4%.

It is also noted that ADGRAPH’s breakage rate is significantly lower than other commonly used privacy-oriented browsers, such as the Tor Browser, which has a breakage rate of 16.3%.

### Feature Analysis

Next, we discuss the intuition behind some of the features used in ADGRAPH and evaluate their ability to distinguish ad/tracking content from benign content. We highlight the most useful features based on information gain.

#### Structural Features

- **Average Degree Connectivity:**
  - AD nodes are expected to have lower average degree connectivity because they interact primarily with ad/tracking content, forming less connected cliques.
  - NON-AD nodes, on the other hand, interact more with functional content, resulting in higher average degree connectivity.
  - **Results:** AD nodes indeed have lower average degree connectivity compared to NON-AD nodes (Figure 3(a)).

- **Parent Attributes:**
  - AD nodes are expected to have different parent attributes, particularly following common practices and standards, such as the IAB’s LEAN standard, which requires asynchronous loading of ad-related scripts.
  - **Results:** The parents of AD nodes with script tags were three times more likely to have the `async` attribute compared to NON-AD nodes (Figure 3(b)).

**Robustness to Obfuscation:**
- Manipulating a node’s average degree connectivity is more challenging for an adversary compared to manipulating the attributes of a parent node.

#### Content Features

- **Domain Party:**
  - AD nodes are more likely to come from third-party domains.
  - **Results:** More than 90% of ads came from third-party domains (Figure 4(a)).

- **URL Length:**
  - AD nodes are expected to have longer URLs with more query parameters.
  - **Results:** AD node URLs were, on average, longer than NON-AD node URLs (Figure 4(b)).

**Robustness to Obfuscation:**
- Switching ads/trackers from third-party to first-party is more challenging for an adversary compared to manipulating URL length.

### Ablation Analysis

We separately evaluate the contribution of structural and content features to ADGRAPH’s accuracy by training additional classifiers using only one type of feature. While both types of features have comparable accuracy, they provide complementary information, enhancing overall performance when used together. Excluding structural features results in a decrease of:
- 6.6% in precision
- 8.7% in recall
- 2.7% in accuracy

**Robustness:**
- Structural features are more robust to obfuscation because they consider the neighboring graph structure, making it more difficult for an adversary to manipulate them compared to content features, which only consider a node in isolation.

### Tradeoffs in Browser Instrumentation

ADGRAPH modifies Chromium to attribute DOM modifications to JavaScript code units, differing from existing content blocking tools that operate at the extension layer. This modification enhances attribution accuracy but complicates distribution. To explore the feasibility of implementing ADGRAPH as a browser extension, we implemented it using the best available attribution option (JavaScript stack walking) and tested its accuracy on the Alexa-10k dataset.

**Results:**
- Implementing ADGRAPH as a browser extension significantly reduces classification accuracy:
  - Precision decreases by 1.5%
  - Recall decreases by 16%
  - Accuracy decreases by 2.3%

The errors in attribution from JavaScript stack walking lead to more classification errors. Therefore, the benefits of increased classification accuracy justify the implementation of ADGRAPH as Blink and V8 modifications.

### Performance

We compare ADGRAPH’s performance with stock Chromium and Adblock Plus. ADGRAPH generally performs faster than Adblock Plus and, in many cases, outperforms stock Chromium. This is due to careful engineering and the network and rendering savings from blocking content.

**Performance Comparison:**
- **Page Load Time:**
  - ADGRAPH: Faster on 24.59% of images, 20.82% of scripts, 6.47% of CSS, 48.03% of AJAX, 37.66% of iframes, and 7.14% of videos.
  - Stock Chromium: Faster on 14.92% of images, 17.96% of scripts, 0.79% of CSS, 36.14% of AJAX, 30.47% of iframes, and 6.20% of videos.

**Conclusion:**
ADGRAPH’s graph-based representation, captured by structural features, contributes to its accuracy and robustness, making it a practical and efficient solution for content blocking.
