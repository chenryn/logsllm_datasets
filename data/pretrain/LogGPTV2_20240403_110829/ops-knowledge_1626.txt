User: I am debugging a Python application, that makes use of os.fork() at some point.
After evaluating the function PDB remains in the parent process (as I can see from the value returned from the function).
How do I switch between child and parent process in PDB?
Assistant: There is no way to do that with pdb.  Your best bet will be to start your pdb session (using pdb.set_trace()) inside the child process after the fork.
