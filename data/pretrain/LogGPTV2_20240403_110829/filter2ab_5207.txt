### Title: Botconf 2013 - My Name is Hunter, Ponmocup Hunter

In early 2011, we detected malware infections in several systems within our network. Starting from a single antivirus (A/V) event, we identified and confirmed multiple infections by using both host- and network-based indicators. A few weeks later, sinkholing of several known command-and-control (C&C) domains revealed that the botnet was extensive, comprising several million compromised devices.

I became deeply engrossed in analyzing and tracking this malware, which could infect fully patched systems protected by firewalls, intrusion prevention systems (IPS), and multi-layered antivirus solutions without exploiting any vulnerabilities. The malware relied solely on social engineering techniques to propagate.

The malware gained significant media attention in June 2012, with sensational headlines such as "printer virus," "printer bomb," and "Trojan.Milicenso: A Paper Salesmanâ€™s Dream Come True." The antivirus detection names for this malware varied widely, and the only common indicator across all infected hosts might be a single registry key. Over time, the infection vectors, C&C domains, IP addresses, and URL patterns were frequently changed to evade detection.

In late 2012, the malware introduced an "anti-sinkholing technique" to thwart attempts at redirecting C&C traffic. Recently, I discovered a method to overcome this anti-sinkholing technique, allowing us to once again sinkhole the botnet's C&C domains. However, the current C&C domains are not as well-known as they were during the initial incident and subsequent analysis in 2011.
