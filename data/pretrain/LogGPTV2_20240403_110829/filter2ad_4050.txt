## 1. Introduction

The increasing complexity of network systems and the heterogeneity of end systems make network management increasingly challenging. To effectively manage networks, it is essential to have detailed information about their behavior, which can be obtained through network measurement.

Passive network measurement systems typically collect packet traces that are stored in trace databases. These traces are then searched and post-processed to extract information about the network state. In our work, we propose two key extensions to this approach:

1. **Distributed Measurement Nodes:** By collecting and correlating traffic from multiple measurement nodes, we aim to provide a richer set of network management applications and traffic profiling capabilities.
2. **Preprocessing of Trace Data:** Scalability is a critical issue in distributed measurement. The aggregate bandwidth of trace data from multiple nodes can overwhelm conventional database systems. To address this, we preprocess packet traces on the measurement node, performing simple statistics collection in real-time.

Figure 1 illustrates the basic architecture of our measurement system. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of packet capture and online preprocessing functions using a network processor. Network processors are software-programmable system-on-a-chip multiprocessors optimized for high-bandwidth I/O and parallel packet processing. We use the Intel IXP 2400 [1] network processor for our proposed system, which includes eight multi-threaded microengines for packet processing and an XScale core processor for control plane functions.

The measurement node performs three main functions:
1. **Packet Capture and Header Parsing:** Each packet is parsed to determine the sequence of headers present, allowing for the consideration of nested protocol headers and different header sizes due to options.
2. **Anonymization:** To ensure user privacy, IP addresses are anonymized online on the network processor during trace collection.
3. **Online Queries and Statistics Collection:** Packet traces are preprocessed on the measurement node to reduce the load on the centralized collection system. If traffic statistics match a particular query, a response is pushed from the measurement node.

## 2. Related Work

Traditionally, network measurement has been approached in two ways: active and passive. Active measurement (e.g., NLANR’s AMP and Surveyor) involves senders and receivers measuring and recording the traffic they send/receive to obtain end-to-end characteristics.

In the passive approach, measurements are taken at specific points in the network to characterize local properties and traffic. Traces of packets passing through a passive measurement point can be analyzed for traffic mix (e.g., protocol or application), flow size, and burstiness. Notable passive measurement projects include Sprint’s IPMON [2], AT&T’s Gigascope [3], and NLANR’s passive measurement efforts [4].

However, these projects do not leverage network processors, which allow for customized online queries. Using network processors is crucial as it offloads complex centralized post-processing and storage of traffic traces to the measurement node.

## 3. IP Address Anonymization

To ensure that no private information is revealed in network traces, IP source and destination addresses must be anonymized. The anonymization algorithm should be "prefix-preserving" to retain some network-level characteristics of the measured traffic.

It is desirable to perform anonymization early in the collection process. By anonymizing header fields on the measurement node itself, the risk of leaking unanonymized data is reduced. This requires the anonymization process to operate at speeds that can keep up with the link rates of the measurement node. Current prefix-preserving anonymization algorithms ([5] and [6]) are computationally intensive and cannot achieve this.

We have developed a novel prefix-preserving anonymization algorithm called TSA (top-hash subtree-replicated anonymization) [7]. TSA computes all necessary cryptographic functions offline, allowing IP addresses to be anonymized by making a small number of memory lookups.

## 4. Measurement Node Prototype

Our prototype implementation of the measurement system is based on the IXP2400 network processor platform. Figure 2 shows the data flow and task allocation to the underlying NP components. The data path bumps incoming traffic from Port 0 to Port 1 and vice versa. Packets that successfully proceed through the data path are enqueued for measurement. If the queue is full, the packet is dropped, and no measurement tasks are performed, ensuring minimal impact on the data path performance.

In the measurement path, packet headers are collected, IP addresses are anonymized, statistics are updated, and a "measurement packet" (containing the packet headers and metadata) is generated and transmitted from Port 2.

The measurement system was simulated using the IXP 2400 network processor simulator. Simulation traffic consisted of unidirectional 60-byte TCP/IP packets over Ethernet. We achieved a transmit rate of up to 1120 Mbps (~900,000 packets per second) on the measurement port (Port 2). The measurement node was also tested on the Radisys ENP-2611 board [8] on a network access link at the University of Massachusetts, functioning at data rates up to 140,000 packets per second.

## 5. Future Work

We are exploring an extension to the current measurement prototype to enable the collection of online statistics and the implementation of queries to the measurement node. The key research question is what traffic statistics to collect and how to access this information through the query interface, which is closely related to the capabilities of the underlying hardware.

We propose implementing simple counting functions on the microengines and leaving more complex processing to the XScale control processor. Specifically, we will collect packet counts, layer 3 and 4 protocol distributions, and counts of packets with special significance (e.g., TCP SYN packets). These statistics can be extended to gather more information through (1) per-flow statistics, (2) window-based statistics, and (3) multi-resolution counters. In all cases, there is a tradeoff between memory requirements and accuracy.

For the query interface, we consider two types of queries: "pull" queries, which retrieve information from the measurement node, and "push" queries, which continuously monitor the packet stream and trigger a response when a specific condition is met.

Finally, accurate time information is necessary for timestamping. We are integrating a GPS receiver with the IXP2400 to implement an NTP-style clock synchronization mechanism on the XScale control processor.
