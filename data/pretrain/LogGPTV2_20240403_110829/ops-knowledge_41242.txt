User: What are the common SQL injection attacks? How to prevent SQL injection attacks?
Assistant: Common SQL injection attacks include: 1. Error-based injection: Attackers construct malicious SQL statements to make database errors and obtain sensitive information. 2. Time-based blind injection: Attackers spend a lot of time determining the structure and data of the database by constructing malicious SQL statements. 3. Injection based on joint query: Attackers use joint query to connect multiple malicious SQL statements together to obtain sensitive information. 4. Error-based injection: The attacker constructs malicious SQL statements to make the database return error information, thereby obtaining sensitive information. In order to prevent SQL injection attacks, you can take the following measures: 1. Input validation: ensure that the input data conforms to the expected format. For limited options, you can use the drop-down menu or radio box to control the input. 2. Parameterized query: Use the parameterized query method to avoid directly splicing the data entered by the user into the SQL statement. 3. The principle of least privilege: Grant least privilege to database users to reduce the impact of attackers on the database. 4. Security audit: Create an audit log record for each database operation, discover and eliminate security risks in a timely manner. 5. Maintenance and update: timely maintain and update the database, discover and repair security vulnerabilities in time.
