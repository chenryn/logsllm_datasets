Develop a vulnerability scanning plan: formulate a vulnerability scanning plan, including scanning time, target scope, and scanning tools. 3. Execute vulnerability scanning: Use a security scanning tool to scan the target system or network to find possible vulnerabilities and generate a scanning report. 4. Analyzing the scanning report: According to the vulnerability information in the scanning report, analyze the vulnerability level and repair plan. 5. Repair the vulnerability: Take corresponding measures to repair the vulnerability according to the level of the vulnerability and the repair plan. 6. Monitoring progress: Continuously monitor the progress of vulnerability repair to ensure that the vulnerability is completely repaired and improve the security of the system or network.
