Thank you so much for this awesome framework. I've only been working with the
framework for a couple of months now, and still unsure of all of the
limitations. This looks like a limitation of the component system.
### Vue.js version
1.0.26
### Reproduction Link
https://jsfiddle.net/CristianGiordano/cdLp4uz2/
### Steps to reproduce
Move a person from one list to another (The list component is re-rendered
alongside the moved dom node)
### What is Expected?
No duplication of elements. Here is a working version (same code) without a
`person` component.

### What is actually happening?
It looks like VueJS cannot re-use existing nodes or find the node which was
moved.
  * I have tried adding a `track-by` id with the relevant object properties.
  * I have tried SortableJS and Dragula sorting libraries with the same issue.
p.s. Apologies if this is not the right forum to raise such an issue.
