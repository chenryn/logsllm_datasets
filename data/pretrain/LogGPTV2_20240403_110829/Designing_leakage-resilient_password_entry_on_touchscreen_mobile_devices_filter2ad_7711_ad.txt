6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Eavesdropping Attacks
Eavesdropping attacks such as vision-based eavesdropping may
require the physical presence of an adversary, which limits the scale
of their threat. However, the scale of attacks is not the only fac-
tor that determines the impact of attacks, which is also decided by
the severity of potential losses. If a victim is an important person
in a company, password leakage may lead to disclosing sensitive
corporate data, which would provide sufﬁcient incentives to an ad-
versary. While internal attacks such as malware and logic key log-
ger could be prevented by properly updating and conﬁguring the
computing system [30, 3, 6, 37] used by the victim, it is difﬁcult
to effectively mitigate the threat of external eavesdropping attacks
due to inevitable exposure of human-computer interaction during
the entry of legacy passwords. This threat becomes more serious in
scenarios when a mobile device is used in public places.
Nevertheless, the threat of external eavesdropping attacks can
be effectively mitigated with CoverPad. Besides enhanced secu-
rity features, our scheme retains most beneﬁts of legacy passwords
and can be implemented on commodity devices. Our scheme is not
only applicable to mobile devices but also other devices equipped
with touch screen. For example, many ATM machines have been
deployed with touch screen. Our scheme can be deployed on these
machines to mitigate the threat of the ATM skimming attack [25].

Although we implement our scheme on Apple iPad, it could be
