**Figure 2:**
This figure illustrates the fraction of spam sent (y-axis) and the number of domains targeted (y-axis) by spamming IP addresses for a typical day's worth of traffic at the email provider's servers. The IPs are sorted in descending order based on the number of spam messages produced.

## Observations and Analysis

While some existing systems collect information from numerous distributed domains, few, if any, build reputations based on observed patterns across these domains. Consequently, an IP address that distributes spam evenly across multiple target domains may evade blacklists entirely. This is because maintaining such lists typically requires explicit reports from networks about "loud" IP addresses, allowing "low and slow" spammers to escape detection and blacklisting.

Previous research has shown that many bots sending spam operate at low volumes when observed at any single domain. However, each of these IP addresses must send small amounts of spam to many domains to be effective. Our analysis confirms this: approximately half of all spam (y-axis) originates from the top 15% of spamming IP addresses (x-axis), which target two or more domains. Similarly, the top spamming IPs responsible for up to 35% of spam target three or more domains. Thus, observing email sending patterns across domains could help identify significant spam sources.

## Performance of IP-Based Blacklists

### Overview of DNS-Based Blacklists (DNSBLs)
DNSBLs leverage the DNS infrastructure to allow users to query for blacklisted IP addresses using existing protocols. A DNSBL maintainer keeps blacklisted IP addresses in a zone file, responding to queries with a specific IP address (e.g., 127.0.0.2) for listed IPs and an NXDOMAIN response for unlisted ones. Maintenance involves adding and removing IPs based on reports and observed activity, with listing durations ranging from 30 minutes to over a year.

### Completeness
We evaluated the completeness of reactive blacklists, specifically Spamhaus (XBL and SBL zones) and SpamCop. We examined one month of spam from two spam traps and mail received at a server hosting hundreds of independent domains.

#### Experiment 1: Spam Traps
- **Trap 1:** Received 384,521 pieces of spam, of which 134,120 (35%) were from unlisted IPs.
- **Trap 2:** Received 172,143 pieces of spam, of which 10% were from unlisted IPs.
- One month later, 20% of spam at Trap 1 and 8.5% at Trap 2 remained unlisted, indicating significant gaps in blacklist coverage.

#### Experiment 2: Accepted Senders
- **Provider Logs:** Of 5,084,771 accepted senders, only 110,542 (2%) became listed in Spamhaus within a month, lower than the 15% reported as spam, suggesting incomplete blacklists even after extended periods.

### Responsiveness
Many DNSBLs require multiple user reports or manual verification before listing an IP, reducing responsiveness. We quantified the responsiveness of Spamhaus by determining the delay between first spam activity and listing.

- **Spam Traps:** 10-15% of unlisted spammers remained unlisted 30 days after spam was received.
- **Provider Data:** Almost 20% of unlisted senders remained unlisted for over 30 days before being added to the blacklist.

This indicates that reactive blacklists can be slow to respond, even for confirmed spammers, providing a significant window of opportunity for non-blacklisted IPs to send spam.

## Conclusion
Reactive blacklists, while useful, can be both incomplete and unresponsive. Observing email patterns across domains and implementing complementary blacklisting techniques could significantly enhance spam detection and prevention.
