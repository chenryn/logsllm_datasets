### A. Attack Success and Antenna Adaptation

For an attack to be successful, it is not necessary for it to succeed every time; occasional success is sufficient. Unlike in benign communication, where the placement of antennas is typically fixed, we assume that the attacker can adjust the antenna placement to adapt to changing channel conditions. This flexibility allows the attacker to operate under more favorable conditions than those found in an average fading channel. Additionally, the process of placing the antennas could be automated using a mechanized antenna array, similar to the approach described in [28].

### B. Partial Information Leakage

In our simulation model and experiments, we used Bit Error Rate (BER) as the primary evaluation metric. While the consequences of a very low BER (where the attacker completely breaks confidentiality) and a BER of 0.5 (where confidentiality remains intact) are clear, we also consider the implications of partial information leakage, such as a BER of 0.2. In this scenario, the attacker successfully recovers 80% of the bits. In many cases, this partial recovery is sufficient to break confidentiality, for example, by revealing a patient's name. Furthermore, if the Implantable Medical Device (IMD) sends the same data multiple times, the attacker can use the additional information to fully recover the patient's name, thus completely compromising the system's confidentiality.

### C. Multiple Friendly Jammers

In this paper, we have discussed friendly jamming schemes that rely on a single jammer. This is a common system model when the goal is to maintain confidentiality, as the legitimate receiver should still be able to demodulate the data. In most cases, the legitimate receiver also acts as the friendly jammer. Schemes that use multiple jammers do not achieve the confidentiality of legitimate messages but instead restrict unauthorized entities from using the communication medium. To the best of our knowledge, the only scheme that relies on multiple jammers for confidentiality is one where the jammers form a "jamming fence" around a protected area [15]. However, in these settings, multiple jammers are used to cover a larger area rather than to improve the system's confidentiality. Therefore, these schemes assume that a single jammer is sufficient to protect the confidentiality of the messages. As such, our attack could also be used to compromise these proposals, at least in positions covered by a single jammer.

### D. Countermeasures

From our analysis and experiments, we can draw several conclusions about possible countermeasures against our attack. While these measures do not guarantee complete confidentiality, they can reduce the attacker's probability of success. Specifically, our simulations and experimental results highlight the importance of the close placement of the jammer (J) to the device (D). Simply choosing a distance \( DJ < \lambda/2 \) does not prevent the attacker from receiving the data. However, the BER of the attacker increases as \( DJ \) decreases. Therefore, \( DJ \) should always be chosen to be as small as possible. Since \( \lambda \) depends on the carrier frequency, \( DJ \) must be smaller for higher frequencies to provide the same level of protection. For example, sending data signals in the Medical Implant Communication Service (MICS) bands is easier to protect than IEEE 802.11 signals. Additionally, we estimate that multiple jammers will force the attacker to use more antennas in their receiving array. The challenge here is to ensure that the intended receiver can still receive the message despite the presence of multiple friendly jammers.

### E. SNR and Multipath Effects

In our simulations, we assumed a certain Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the attacker in the absence of the jammer. This assumption is necessary because evaluating the performance of our attack only makes sense if the attacker can receive the message without a friendly jammer. For our simulations, we estimated the SNR at the attacker to be 16 dB. The attacker can improve their SNR by using better receiving equipment, such as low-noise amplifiers, better Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), and high-gain antennas, which would enhance the efficiency of our attacks.

Another important factor affecting the performance of our attacks is multipath effects. In our analysis, we focused on modeling line-of-sight channels. In practice, multipath effects can degrade the performance of our attack by introducing additional phase shifts or signal fading. Nevertheless, our experiments conducted in real-world settings under the influence of multipath effects still yield realistic attacker scenarios. However, the performance for non-line-of-sight scenarios needs further exploration. It is expected that, in the worst case, the attacker still has a probabilistic chance of randomly being in a correct position for their attack, similar to malicious interference attacks in [29].

### F. Effect of Signal Bandwidth and Modulation Scheme

We noted earlier that higher signal bandwidth results in a more distorted reconstructed data signal. To understand the effects of signal bandwidth on our proposed attack, we consider the ratio \( r = \beta / f_c \) of the data signal bandwidth \( \beta \) and its carrier frequency \( f_c \). For MICS signals, this ratio is around 0.00075, while in Ultra-Wideband (UWB) communications, \( r \) could approach 0.25. The ratio directly relates to the length of a baseband symbol, expressed in carrier periods. In our presented cancellation scheme, the two data components are subtracted with some phase shift, ideally \( \lambda/2 \). For signals with very low bandwidth, adding a \( \lambda/2 \)-shifted version of itself completely cancels the signal, and subtracting it almost doubles the amplitude. For signals with higher bandwidth, subtracting a \( \lambda/2 \)-shifted version will not completely cancel the signal, as the amplitudes of the carrier change considerably with each period. Intuitively, with lower signal bandwidth, the signal is more similar to its \( \lambda/2 \)-shifted version, and thus the cancellation (or amplification) will be better. Figure 16 shows how different values of \( r \) affect the cancellation rate.

In this work, we focused on low-bandwidth Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK) as the modulation scheme. We leave the evaluation of other modulation schemes, such as high-bandwidth UWB signals, for future work.

### G. Jamming for Access Control

Throughout the paper, we focused on jamming for confidentiality. Jamming can also be used to achieve access control, i.e., using friendly jamming to deny access to a protected device. Existing schemes implement one of the following jammer classes:

- **Fast Jammer**: A friendly jammer demodulates signals intended for the protected device in real-time. Upon demodulating and inspecting parts of the frame, a decision is made whether or not the frame is allowed. If the frame does not conform to a predefined access control policy, the remaining portion of the frame will be jammed. This strategy prevents the protected device from successfully demodulating a complete adversarial query.
- **Slow Jammer**: The friendly jammer listens for messages destined for the protected device but does not start jamming mid-frame. The jammer receives the entire frame and, if the access control policy is violated, starts jamming the reply of the protected device.

Xu et al. propose a scheme for securing IMD devices against access from unauthorized sources [12]. Security is enforced by a specialized device, the Guardian, which employs friendly jamming. The authors argue that it is more reliable and effective to let the Guardian jam replies by the IMD rather than directly jamming query messages issued by the attacker. The Guardian device can effectively set its own jamming parameters because it knows the transmission power and reply timing information of the protected IMD.

Rieback et al. proposed the concept of selective RFID jamming to enforce access control of RFID tags [8], [9]. An external friendly jammer listens for queries towards protected RFID tags. If the query is not allowed based on an access control policy, the tag reply is jammed.

The above works jam replies made by the protected device but not adversarial queries, implementing the slow jammer approach.

Martinovic et al. proposed a scheme based on a fast jammer. The authors use the concept of friendly jamming in sensor networks to enforce access control by jamming unauthenticated frames in mid-air [10]. The proposed scheme prevents protected devices from successfully demodulating unauthorized queries, implementing the fast jammer approach.

Our proposed attack can be used against access control schemes that implement the slow jammer approach. An adversary can mount an active attack by sending unsanctioned queries to protected devices. Friendly jammers detect such queries and jam device replies. However, our scheme can then be used to remove the jamming component from the reply. By doing so, the adversary can bypass the access control policy and communicate with the protected device as if a friendly jammer were not present.

### VI. Conclusion

In this work, we revisited the confidentiality guarantees provided by friendly jamming schemes. We focused on the assumption that the attacker cannot recover the confidential message if the friendly jammer and the message source are in close proximity. We showed, both analytically and experimentally, that this assumption does not hold. In our experiments, performed in the MICS band, we demonstrated the successful recovery of confidential messages from up to 3 meters away, even when the friendly jammer and the source were placed only a few centimeters apart. Our results indicate that friendly jamming schemes have fundamental security limitations when used to achieve confidentiality.
