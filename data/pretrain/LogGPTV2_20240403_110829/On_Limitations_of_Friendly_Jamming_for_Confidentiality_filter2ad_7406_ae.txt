it sufﬁces for the attack to be successful some times, not
necessarily all the time. Also, unlike communication partners
in benign communication, we assume that the attacker can
afford to adapt the antenna placement for changing channel
conditions. This allows us to operate in more favorable
settings than the average fading channel. We also note that
the process of placing the antennas could be automated with
a mechanized antenna array, similar to [28].
B. Partial Information Leakage
In our simulation model and experiments we used BER as
an evaluation metric. While the consequences of a very low

BER (the attacker completely breaks conﬁdentiality) and a
BER of 0.5 (conﬁdentiality remains intact) at the attacker
are clear, we discuss the implications of partial information
leakage—for example, a BER of 0.2 at the attacker. In this
scenario, the attacker will successfully recover 80% of the
bits. In many cases, this leads to the attacker completely
breaking conﬁdentiality, e.g., a patient’s name. In addition,
if the IMD sends the same data again (e.g. in a repeated
message), the attacker will be able to use this additional
information to recover the patient’s name, thus completely
breaking the system’s conﬁdentiality.
C. Multiple Friendly Jammers
In this paper, we discussed friendly jamming schemes
that rely on a single jammer. This is a commonly used
system model when the goal is conﬁdentiality, as the le-
gitimate receiver should be able to demodulate the data. In
most cases, the legitimate receiver also acts as the friendly
jammer. Schemes that use multiple jammers do not achieve
conﬁdentiality of legitimate messages but are only able to
restrict unauthorized entities from using the communication
medium. To the best of our knowledge, the only scheme
which relies on multiple jammers for conﬁdentiality is
one where the jammers form a “jamming fence” around a
protected area [15]. Nevertheless, in these settings, multiple
jammers are used to cover a greater area and not to improve
system’s conﬁdentiality. Thus, these schemes assume that a
single jammer is enough to protect the conﬁdentiality of the
messages. As such, we follow that our attack could also be
used to attack these proposals—at least for positions which
are only covered by a single jammer.
D. Countermeasures
From our analysis and experiments, we can draw several
conclusions on possible countermeasures against our attack.
While these do not guarantee complete conﬁdentiality of
the system, they decrease the attacker’s probability of suc-
cess. In particular, our simulations and experimental results
underline the impact of close placement of J to D. As
we have shown, simply choosing DJ < λ/2 does not
prevent the attacker from receiving the data. Nevertheless,
the BER of the attacker rises with decreasing DJ. Therefore,
DJ should always be chosen to be as small as possible.
As λ depends on the carrier frequency, DJ must be be
smaller for higher frequencies to provide the same level
of protection. Therefore, sending data signals in the MICS
bands is easier to protect than, for example, IEEE 802.11
signals. In addition, we estimate that multiple jammers will
at least force the attacker to use more antennas for his
receiving array. As discussed before, the problem here is to
ensure that the intended receiver can still receive the message
despite the presence of multiple friendly jammers.
E. SNR and Multipath Effects
In our simulations while computing BER, we assume a
certain SNR at the attacker in the absence of the jammer.
This is because a performance evaluation of our attack
only makes sense if the attacker can receive the message
in the absence of a friendly jammer. For our simulations,
our estimations of the SNR at the attacker was 16 dB. The
attacker can improve his SNR by using better receiving
equipment (e.g. low noise ampliﬁers, better ADC, high-gain
antennas etc.). This would even improve the efﬁciency of
our attacks.
Another important factor affecting the performance of
our attacks are the multipath effects. In our analysis, we
concentrate on modeling line-of-sight channels. In practice,
multipath effects can degrade the performance of our at-
tack by introducing additional phase shifts or signal fading
effects. Nevertheless, our experiments, conducted in real-
world settings under the inﬂuence of multipath effects, still
yield realistic attacker scenarios. However, the performance
for non line-of-sight scenarios needs to be further explored.
It is to be expected that in the worst case, the attacker still
has a probabilistic chance of randomly being at a correct
position for his attack (similar to malicious interference
attacks in [29]).
F. Effect of Signal Bandwidth and Modulation Scheme
We noted earlier that higher signal bandwidth results in a
more distorted reconstructed data signal.
To understand the effects of signal bandwidth on our
proposed attack, we consider the ratio r = β/fc of data
signal bandwidth β and its carrier frequency fc. While
for MICS signals this ratio is around 0.00075, in UWB
communications r could approach 0.25. The ratio directly
relates to the length of a baseband symbol, expressed in
carrier periods. In our presented cancellation scheme, the
two data components are subtracted with some phase shift,
ideally λ/2. For signals with very low bandwidth, adding a
λ/2-shifted version of itself completely cancels the signal
and subtracting it almost doubles the amplitude. For signals
with higher bandwidth, subtracting a λ/2-shifted version
will not completely cancel the signal, since the amplitudes
of the carrier will change considerably with each period.
Intuitively, with lower signal bandwidth, the signal is more
similar to its λ/2-shifted version, and thus the cancellation
(or ampliﬁcation) will be better. Figure 16 shows how
different values of r affect the cancellation rate.
In this work we focused on low-bandwidth FSK as modu-
lation scheme. We leave the evaluation of other modulations
schemes (e.g. high bandwidth UWB signals) for future work.
G. Jamming for Access Control
Throughout the paper we focused on jamming for conﬁ-
dentiality. Jamming can also be used for achieving access
control, i.e., using friendly jamming in order to deny access

to a protected device. Existing schemes implement one of
the following jammer classes.
• Fast jammer. A friendly jammer demodulates signals
intended for the protected device in real-time. Upon de-
modulating and inspecting parts of the frame, a choice
is made whether or not the frame is allowed. In case the
frame does not conform to a pre-deﬁned access control
policy,
the remaining portion of the frame will be
jammed. Such a strategy prevents the protected device
from successfully demodulating a complete adversarial
query.
• Slow jammer. The friendly jammer listens for mes-
sages destined for the protected device but does not start
jamming in mid-frame. The jammer receives the whole
frame and, in case the access control policy is violated,
starts jamming the reply of the protected device.
Xu et al. propose a scheme for securing IMD devices
against access from unauthorized sources [12]. Security is
enforced by a specialized device which employs friendly
jamming—the Guardian. The authors argue it is more re-
liable and effective to let the Guardian jam replies by the
IMD, instead of directly jamming query messages issued
by the attacker. The Guardian device can effectively set it’s
own jamming parameters because it knows the transmission
power and reply timing information of the protected IMD.
Rieback et al. proposed the concept of selective RFID
jamming to enforce access control of RFID tags [8], [9].
An external friendly jammer listens for queries towards
protected RFID tags. If the query is not allowed, based on
an access control policy, the tag reply is jammed.
The above works jam replies made by the protected
device, but not adversarial queries—they implement the slow
jammer approach.
Martinovic et al. proposed a scheme based on a fast
jammer. The authors use the concept of friendly jamming in
sensor networks to enforce access control by jamming unau-
thenticated frames in mid-air [10]. The proposed scheme
prevents protected devices from successfully demodulating
unauthorized queries, i.e., it implements the fast jammer
approach.
Our proposed attack can be used against access control
schemes which implement the slow jammer approach. An
adversary can mount an active attack by sending unsanc-
tioned queries to protected devices. Friendly jammers detect
such queries and jam device replies. However, our scheme
is then used to remove the jamming component from the
reply. By doing so, an adversary is able to bypass the access
control policy and communicate with the protected device
in the same way as if a friendly jammer was not present.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this work, we revisit
the conﬁdentiality guarantees
provided by friendly jamming schemes. We focused on the
assumption that the attacker cannot recover the conﬁdential
message if the friendly jammer and the message source
are in close proximity. We showed, both analytically and
experimentally, that this assumption does not hold. In our
experiments, performed in the MICS band, we demonstrated
the successful recovery of conﬁdential messages from up
to 3 m away, when a friendly jammer and the source were
placed only few centimeters apart. Our results show that
friendly jamming schemes have some fundamental security
limitations when they are used to achieve conﬁdentiality.
