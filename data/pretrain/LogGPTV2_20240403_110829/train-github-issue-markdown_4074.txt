I have implemented, documented and tested a new function  
called 'fast_vectorize'. This function is intended to be used  
as a decorator, and it's purpose is to easily create Ufunc  
objects for a given python function. The function translates a  
Python function, actually an RPython (resticted Python) function,  
which is still valid Python, into C using the PyPy translator.  
Therefore this functions has a dependency on pypy. However, pypy  
is imported in a lazy manner, such that scipy itself will not depend  
on pypy, which is a big project.
Included in the patch is the core implementation, tests, benchmarks,  
as well as examples.
I have tested this patch against latest svn numpy trunk (which  
is required for the current scipy trunk), Python2.4 on SuSE Linux  
and Python2.5 on OSX10.4.
To apply the patch, you need to go change to the scipy root and run patch:
    $ cd scipy
    $ ls

    INSTALL.txt            new_manifest.sh  setup.py          TOCHANGE.txt
