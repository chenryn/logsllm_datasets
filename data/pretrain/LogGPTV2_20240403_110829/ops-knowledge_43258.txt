User: I have recently get hold of a RackSpace Ubuntu server and it has pythons all over the place: 
iPython in 3.5, Pandas in 3.4 &2.7, modules I need like pyodbc etc. are only in 2,7
Therefore, I am keen to clean up the box and, as a 2.7 users, keep everything in 2.7. 
So the key question is, is there a way to remove both 3.4 and 3.5 efficiently at the same time while keeping Python 2.7?
Assistant: neither try any above ways nor sudo apt autoremove python3 because it will remove all gnome based applications from your system including gnome-terminal. In case if you have done that mistake and left with kernal only than trysudo apt install gnome on kernal.
try to change your default python version instead removing it. you can do this through bashrc file or export path command.
