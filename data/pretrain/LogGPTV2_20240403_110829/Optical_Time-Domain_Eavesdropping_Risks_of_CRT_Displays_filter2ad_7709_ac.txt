and a tradeoff has to be found between deconvolution and
noise control.
Figure 8 shows the digital simulation of a simple ﬁrst-
order Butterworth high-pass ﬁlter with a cut-off frequency
of 4 MHz applied to the signal. Such a ﬁlter could be im-
plemented quite easily as just a resistor-capacitor combi-
nation. Its application leads to a dramatic improvement in
text readability, though the resulting image still shows quite
noticeable distortions. These are due to the fact that this
simple ﬁlter applies a 20 dB per decade roll-off from 4 to
0 MHz, whereas the frequency characteristic of the phos-
phors (Fig 5) is actually signiﬁcantly ﬂatter below 4 MHz.
A much better reconstruction can be obtained by decon-
volution, that is with the help of a ﬁlter that has approxi-
mately the inverse phase and frequency characteristic of the
phosphor. To generate the image ˜v(t) in Fig. 9, I sampled
the model impulse response function PP22(t) with the same
sampling frequency and number of samples as the recorded
averaged luminosity signal I(t) for a single frame, then

Fourier transformed both, divided the complex results, and
applied the inverse Fourier transform:

(cid:4) F{I}
F{PP22}
˜v = F−1
(12)
No padding was necessary before performing the Fourier
transform since I(t) is a periodic signal anyway, PP22(t)
has already dropped close to zero near the beginning of the
frame period, and the FFTW code [17] used to perform the
calculation can also handle block sizes other than 2n for the
discrete Fourier transform quite efﬁciently.
The result of the deconvolution shows a signiﬁcantly im-
proved contrast, the smear along the electron beam path to
the right of each illuminated pixel is reduced, and even the
smallest font size of the test chart (with an H-height of 8
pixels or 4 mm) becomes readable.
Slightly sharper edges can be restored for blue text than
for green (and consequently white) text, which conﬁrms
what the measured frequency characteristic of the three
phosphors in Fig. 5 already suggested. The high-frequency
components of the red signal remain too weak for this sen-
sor setup.

6. Threat analysis
With the help of a phosphor decay curve like the one
shown in Fig. 3, we can now estimate the signal strength
that an eavesdropper can receive and what upper bound on
the reception distance is imposed by shot noise. For deﬁni-
tions of the radiometric and photometric quantities and SI
units used here, see [16, 18].2 For the following order-of-
magnitude estimates, we assume in the interest of simplic-
ity that the screen, wall, and sensor surfaces involved are
roughly parallel to each other and that the photons of inter-
est travel perpendicular to these, otherwise the cosine of the
relevant angles would have to be multiplied in as well.
6.1. Direct observation
We ﬁrst consider the case without diffuse reﬂection from
a wall, where the eavesdropper can see the screen surface di-
rectly. This might allow projective observation with a tele-
scope, but the result might not be satisfactory in situations
with minor distortions such as aperture diffraction, atmo-
spheric ﬂuctuations or even a frosted glass window. Time-
domain analysis of the received light could be of interest
even where a line of sight is available.

beam illuminates a single pixel. The video voltage due to
one pixel (full intensity: V = 1 V) will be

We approximate the detection process performed in the re-

2In a nutshell: Luminous ﬂux is measured in lumen (lm), which is
the photometric equivalent of radiation power, weighted by the spectral
sensitivity of the human eye, where 683 lm are per deﬁnition as bright
as 1 W of (green) 540 THz light. In order-of-magnitude calculations, I
will simply approximate 103 lm as 1 W. The steradian (sr) measures a
solid angle (4π for the full sphere), candela (cd) is the same as lumen per
steradian and measures the luminous intensity of a light source in a given
direction, and lux (lx) is the same as lumen per square meter and measures
the illuminance of a location. Commonly encountered illuminance levels
cover ten orders of magnitude, from 105 lx for “direct sunlight” to 10−4 lx
for “overcast night sky (no moon or light pollution)” [16, p. 16].
We can now ﬁll this condition with some example pa-
rameters. Assuming a background luminance of 100 cd/m2,
as it is typical for a CRT and other bright surfaces in
a well-lit ofﬁce environment [16, 10], the corresponding
background radiance will be in the order of not more than
Lb = 0.1 W/(sr·m2), from which we mask off an observed
area of A = 0.2 m2. Together with other typical parameters
such as tp = 20 ns, P (0) = 103 W/(V · s · sr), V = 1 V,
λ = 500 nm, and by averaging n = 100 frames, we get
> 4 × 10−5 sr.

For example, a simple telescope with Ar = 0.3 m2 could
therefore theoretically receive a signal under these well-lit
conditions up to in the order of 80 m away.
6.2. Indirect observation
We now consider an indirect observation in a dark envi-
ronment, where the not directly visible CRT screen faces at
distance d(cid:4)
a diffusely reﬂecting observable wall, which has
a reﬂection factor 0

Let’s again look at an example scenario. Assuming the
observed monitor has a luminous intensity of 100 cd/m2 ×
240 mm × 320 mm = 8 cd, a wall at a distance d(cid:4) = 2 m
would be exposed to an illuminance of in the order of 2 lx
from the overall light given of by the monitor alone, which

1081-6011/02 $17.00 ' 2002 IEEE 
corresponds to the illuminance during “late twilight” [16]
and is equivalent to an irradiance of in the order of Eb =
1 mW/m2. Using this with the same example parameters as
before, as well as A = 2 m2 and  = 0.5, we get

for this indirect observation under late twilight conditions.
The Ar = 0.3 m2 mirror used as an example before could
√
therefore receive a signal under these conditions up to in the
order of 50 m. This distance is proportional to 1/
Eb, so
for example under full daylight illuminance (104 lx), obser-
vation would already be infeasible just one meter from the
wall.
6.3. Observation of other displays
It is worth noting that the very high pixel frequencies
used by CRTs play a signiﬁcant rˆole in limiting the recep-
tion range. Optical displays with lower update frequencies
could also pose an eavesdropping risk, even if they do not
offer the redundancy of a repetitive video signal. A practi-
cal example would be devices with slow serial ports (104–
105 bit/s), such as some modems, that feature light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) to indicate optically the logic level of data
lines. Unless the displayed signal is distorted, for example
by a monostable-multivibrator circuit that enforces a mini-
mum on period of at least a byte time, an optical eavesdrop-
per could manage to reconstruct transmitted data by moni-
toring the LED luminosity at a distance.
Another example would be software-controllable status
LEDs such as those connected to the keyboard and hard-
disk controller of every PC, and also of course the infrared
ports found in many mobile computers. Malicious software
could use these in order to covertly broadcast information
in situations where this cannot be accomplished via normal
network connections (e.g., due to “air gap” security or a
mandatory access-control operating system).
A link budget and shot noise calculation very similar to
the one developed in the previous sections can be used here
as well to estimate what upper bounds for bit error rates an
eavesdropper has to expect depending on the distance and
background illumination.
Normal LEDs have a luminous intensity of in the or-
der of 1–10 mcd, although super-bright variants with up to
100 mcd or more are available as well. We can again es-
timate the expected number of photons Np received from
a single bit pulse of the LED, as well as the expected num-
ber Nb from the background illumination. For a sufﬁciently
large Nb, we can approximate the distribution of the num-
ber N of photons received as a normal distribution
