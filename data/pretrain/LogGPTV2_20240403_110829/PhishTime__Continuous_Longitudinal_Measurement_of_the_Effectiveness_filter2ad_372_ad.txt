Table 3: Blacklist performance vs. evasive phishing (Experiments B, C, D: average of all deployments).
phisticated phishing websites without any form of evasion,
it allows us to establish a baseline for best-case blacklist per-
formance which we can compare against other experiments.
Desktop Blacklists. With an average coverage of 92.9%
and an average speed of 56 minutes (based on the medians
acrossoursixdeployments),overall,GSBprovedtobethebest-
performingblacklistwetested. SmartScreen showedaslightly
higher coverage of 93.2%, but had a slower speed of 3 hours
and 47 minutes. Opera’s coverage was the lowest, at 60.5%,
though its 55-minute speed managed to inch ahead of GSB.
Mobile Blacklists. The mobile version of Firefox mir-
rored the 92.9% coverage of GSB on desktop and had the
highest coverage of the mobile blacklists we tested. Mobile
Chrome and mobile Safari delivered a much lower coverage
of 57.8%, whereas Opera’s coverage was minimal at 3.7%.
Although aggregate speed and coverage metrics provide
an assessment of overall blacklist performance, they fail to il-
lustrate speci(cid:27)c di(cid:29)erences in behavior between blacklists. In
Figure 5, we plot the growth of each blacklist’s coverage over
the course of the (cid:27)rst 12 hours of our deployments (the same
data over the full one-week deployment is in Figure 6). We ob-
serve that GSB and Opera both start blacklisting as early as 20
minutes after receiving our phishing reports. SmartScreen’s
earliest response occurred about one hour after GSB and
Opera, and grew over a seven-hour period thereafter. On
desktop platforms, GSB coverage grows quickly and stabilizes
after approximately three hours; on mobile devices, coverage
grows more slowly over a longer period and is a subset of the
desktop blacklisting. We did not observe any patterns in our
website con(cid:27)gurations that consistently led to mobile black-
listing, nor did such websites receive more crawler tra(cid:28)c.
Long-term Blacklist Consistency. High blacklist speed
and coverage are necessary to e(cid:29)ectively protect users
from phishing websites, but, given the pressure upon the
ecosystem by phishers [2, 25], it is equally important that
blacklist performance remains consistent in the long term.
By comparing the measurements between successive deploy-
ments (in Table 2 and 3 for non-evasive and evasive phishing
websites, respectively), we can evaluate this consistency.

8.1 Discovery
Of the 4,158 URLs that we deployed, 4,068 received tra(cid:28)c
from at least one crawler. The 94 URLs which were never
visited were all part of Deployment 3: 81 URLs were part
of Experiment E (reported to a single entity) and 13 were
post-redirection landing pages within Experiment C.
3,514 of our URLs were blacklisted in at least one browser.
Of the 644 URLs never blacklisted, 299 were part of Experi-
ment F (in which sophisticated cloaking successfully evaded
detection), 131 were part of Experiments E or G (which were
not designed to guarantee discovery), and 214 were part of
Experiments B, C, and D (with cloaking and redirection).
Given that the aforementioned lack of tra(cid:28)c can be
attributed to the ecosystem issues we identi(cid:27)ed during
Deployment 3 (discussed in Section 8.2), and the fact that
all websites from Experiment A were blacklisted in at least
one browser, we believe that our reporting methodology was
successful in ensuring prompt discovery by the ecosystem.
8.2 Overall Blacklist Performance
In Table 2, we show the blacklist speed and coverage results
from each of the six deployments of Experiment A, as well
as the average number of crawler requests to each individual
website. Because this experiment consisted solely of unso-
