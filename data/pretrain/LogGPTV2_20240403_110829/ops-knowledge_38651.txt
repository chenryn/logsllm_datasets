User: Does anyone know of a .net wrapper around either python or java Google App Engine services?
Any help appreciated // :)
Assistant: Python has a .NET alternative called IronPython. But I don't think it will work in GAE as it supports only pure python. I am also facing a similar problem trying to port a source written in C#.net into GAE compatible code. I'm going to work around it by re-inventing the spokes of the wheel (not the wheel itself) by re-doing the UI using SVG or some other method. Have you considered that?
