 Website History and Website Capture
Sometimes you want to go back in time to investigate something in the past. Website 
capture is useful for online investigations because you can ensure that a snapshot of 
a given website will always remain online even if the original page disappears. Please 
note that saved pages are usually stored without their associated scripts, so some 
functionality, themes, and menus may not work correctly.
There are many online sites that offer such services; the following are the most 
popular ones:
• 
Internet Archive (the Wayback Machine; https://archive.org/web/
web.php) is the most popular archive site; it has more than 308 billion 
web pages saved over time, and anyone can capture a web page as 
it appears now to use it in the future as a clue or a reference (the 
captured website should allow crawlers). See Figure 4-14.

• 
Archive (https://archive.fo/) is also available.
• 
Cached pages (www.cachedpages.com/) shows previous websites 
captured on three different archive websites (Google cache, Coral, 
and Archive.org).
• 
www.screenshots.com shows screenshot history for any website.
• 
Way Backpack (https://github.com/jsvine/waybackpack) is a tool 
that allows you to download the entire Wayback Machine archive for 
a given web page.
• 
Library of Congress (https://loc.gov/websites) is another one.
• 
UK Web Archive (www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa) is another one.
• 
Stanford Web Archive Portal (https://swap.stanford.edu) is 
another one.

• 
Oldweb.today (http://oldweb.today) retrieves archived web pages 
from the different public Internet archives. You can also display 
archived websites using different web browsers.
• 
UK Government Web Archive (www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/
webarchive/) holds U.K. government web archives published on the 
Web since 1996 to the present. The archived contents include videos, 
tweets, and web pages.
 Website Monitoring Services
Sometimes you might need to know about changes to a specific website when they 
happen. Tracking down changes to one website can be achieved by visiting it regularly. 
However, what can you do if you need to track page changes to many sites at once?
There are many online services that allow you to track an unlimited number of 
pages. This works by sending you an alert e-mail once a change is detected in the 
specific page (chosen by you). Some paid services allow you to receive SMS alerts also. 
The following are the major free website-monitoring services currently available:
• 
Google Alerts (https://www.google.com/alerts; see Figure 4-15) 
is a web content change detection (based on your search phrase or 
keywords) and notification service offered by Google. To set an alert, 
you need to go to the Google Alerts page (you need to sign into your 
Google account first) and enter the search phrase or word (it should 
be specific, not general, to avoid getting too many results). Google 
will notify you by e-mail when the specified search phrase or word 
appears in the newly indexed search results anywhere online (it will 
not notify you about current results available on the Web).

• 
Talk Walker (www.talkwalker.com/alerts) is an alternative to 
Google Alerts.
• 
Visual Ping (https://visualping.io) monitors web pages for any 
detected change; the free account gives you 62 checks per month.
• 
Follow That Page (https://www.followthatpage.com) gives you two 
daily checks with the free account.
• 
Watch That Page (www.watchthatpage.com) gives you 70 weekly 
checks on all your pages.
• 
Update Scanner (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/update-scanner) is a Firefox extension that monitors web 
pages for updates.

 RSS Feed
Another method to monitor website changes is to use an RSS feed. So, what does RSS 
mean?
Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary is an XML (text) file that allows site 
owners to inform subscribed readers—and other sites—about new content published on 
their sites. RSS revolutionizes how Internet users can track updated content online. To 
check for new site updates, a user needs to have an RSS feed reader. The user subscribes 
to the site RSS feed, and then any new content on this site will appear in their feed reader 
automatically. Each feed entry will usually contain the title, summary of the published 
text, date of publishing, and author name.
Subscribing to a website RSS will make a user aware of any updates on to their 
monitored sites, thus removing the need to visit intended websites continually to check 
for newly published contents.
Major web browsers offer a mechanism to subscribe to the site RSS feed. Mozilla 
Firefox comes equipped with built-in RSS support called Live Bookmarks. To subscribe 
to any website RSS feed through Firefox, follow these steps:
 1. Navigate to the website where you want to subscribe to its RSS 
feed.
 2. From the Bookmarks menu, select Subscribe to This Page (if the 
browser does not detect an RSS feed on the page, this option will 
be grayed out). Then select your feed. Figure 4-16 shows two feeds 
for this site because it is a blog, one for the comments and the 
second for site contents named Feed.
Figure 4-16. Subscribe to an RSS feed using Firefox
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
163
 3. The next page appears. Use the Firefox subscription box at the top 
to confirm your subscription. Make sure to set the option as in 
Figure 4-17.
 4. After clicking Subscribe Now, a pop-up message will appear 
allowing you to change the feed name and location. The default 
settings should be OK. Hit the Subscribe button and you are done!
The built-in RSS feed reader in a browser has limited functionality compared to some 
dedicated desktop RSS feed reader software. For instance, RSSOwl (www.rssowl.org/) 
comes with powerful features such as searching within feeds, saving a previous feed 
search, and getting notifications on new content. It is free and comes supported on all 
major platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
There are also browser extensions—add-ons—for major web browsers in addition 
to online services that offer feed subscription. However, if you are part of an online 
investigation, it is preferable to use only the built-in browser feed utility or the RSSOwl 
software to avoid leaking information about your stored feed. Many browser extensions 
request access to your browser surfing history, and this may result in a privacy breach if 
such records fall into the wrong hands.
 News Search
A wealth of useful information about anything can be found in news sources. For 
instance, a corporation can gain deep insight about any competitor like its legal history, 
partnership agreements, financial status, and any negative mention by searching within 
news archives. We gave an example for business corporations; however, the same things 
apply to governments, nonprofit organizations, and high-profile individuals.

Searching in news online is easier than searching in a media broadcast archive. In 
this section, we will cover how you can customize Google News to know about the latest 
updates of any search keyword/phrase appearing in global news channels. We will also 
mention other online news sources and give advice on how to detect fake news.
 Customize Google News
Google News offers an up-to-date news service aggregated from various sources around 
the world. A user can select a topic of interest, and Google will show relevant results 
about this topic. Online investigators can exploit the Google News service to simplify 
searching for specific topics or search terms within the news. To do this, follow these 
steps:
 1. Go to https://news.google.com.
 2. Go to the left side of the page and click “Manage sections”  
(see Figure 4-18).
Figure 4-18. Customizing Google News
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
165
 3. The page in Figure 4-19 appears. Enter the topic or keywords in 
the “Search terms” text box; you can also name the title of the 
search. Then click the Add Section button.
Now, a new section will appear in the left vertical menu of Google News. To search 
for specific keywords, all you need to do is to click the section name and Google will 
display the relevant news search results.
Note! google keeps an archive of previous news; you can check it at  
https://news.google.com/newspapers.

 Fake News Detection
In today’s digital age, everything is connected online, and a large number of people 
receive their news using social media sites, where anyone can post anything using a 
fake identity. In addition, there are many unreliable news sites that announce news 
without investigating its source accurately. For instance, any malicious actor can spread 
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
167
misleading news for commercial gain, for propaganda purposes, or to mislead people 
about something. Such false news can spread instantly because of the simplicity of 
sharing information across different social media platforms and, consequently, through 
the entire Internet.
Detecting fake news has become a hot topic today and attracts huge attention. Major 
social platforms—like Twitter and Facebook—have promised their users they will find 
a solution to stop or at least decrease the harm of fake news. Researchers continue in 
this field with emphasis on developing artificial intelligence solutions (such as machine 
learning and natural language processing) to combat fake news.
As an OSINT investigator, you will certainly encounter fake news during your search 
for resources. Any suspicious information should not be included in your case files. To 
help sort true information from false information, you should use the following checklist 
for investigating suspicious news:
 1. Read the entire article or piece of information first. Do not believe 
anything until you review its source.
 2. Read the source of the news/information.
 3. If the source comes from a credible or well-known website (for 
example, a global well- known news agency), do the following:
 a. 
Go to the source of the news to see whether the same 
information is presented on its site. For example, if a piece of 
news is attributed to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com), 
check its website to see whether the same information exists 
there.
 4. If the information comes from an unknown source, you need to 
conduct an online search to see who else has published the same 
news.
 a. 
If a credible and well-known website published the same 
story from the same source, it is highly likely to be a true story.
 b. 
Otherwise, you need to check more about the issue or decline 
to use the information.
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
168
Warning! Do not trust information published on social sites only. instead, 
conduct an online search to see whether the same news has been published 
elsewhere. if you find that this news is false, make sure to report it to the site 
operators (for example, Facebook allows its users to report posts for review).
You should read news, articles, and other content only on reputable websites. Less- 
known sites should be investigated thoroughly before considering their news as valid.
There are many sites online that help you to figure out whether something is false 
news/information. The following are the most important ones:
• 
Snopes (https://www.snopes.com) discovers false news, stories, and 
urban legends and researches/validates rumors to see whether they 
are true (see Figure 4-20).
• 
Hoaxy (https://hoaxy.iuni.iu.edu) checks the spread of false 
claims (like a hoax, rumor, satire, or news report) across social 
media sites. The site derives its results from reputable fact-checking 
organizations to return the most accurate results.
• 
FactCheck (www.factcheck.org/fake-news) is partnered with 
Facebook to help identify and label fake news reported by its users. 
It also monitors different media for the false information covering a 
wide range of topics like health, science, and hoaxes spread through 
spam e-mails.
• 
https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking gives a map of global 
fact-checking sites (see Figure 4-21).

 Searching for Digital Files
In a previous section, we talked briefly about how to use Google and Bing advanced 
search operators to search for different types of digital files (documents, images, and 
videos). In this section, we will continue our discussion and show how to utilize different 
techniques and specialized search engines to search for files in a variety of formats.
Digital files constitute an important percentage of web contents located on the 
surface web. Now, with the availability of free cloud file-hosting services (Dropbox, 
Google Drive) and video-sharing sites (YouTube), individuals and corporations are used 
to using such services for online sharing. Digital files found online can contain a wealth 
of information, not only in their contents but also in their metadata (hidden attributes).
 Document Search
This section is dedicated to online document search, but before we start, let’s first talk 
about the most common document file formats available online.
 DOC and DOCX
DOC and DOCX are the standard file formats for Microsoft Word documents. Microsoft 
Word is part of the Microsoft Office suite created by Microsoft. The .doc extension is 
for older versions of Microsoft Word, such as 2003 and older. New editions of Microsoft 
Word (beginning with 2007) have the .docx extension.
 HTML and HTM
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard web page file format to represent content on 
the Web. Both extensions (.html and .htm) can be used interchangeably. To edit these 
files, you can use any text editor. However, to decode and display HTML file contents, 
you need to open the HTML file using a web browser.
 ODT
This is a text document file format (formatted using the OASIS OpenDocument XML- 
based standard) like the Microsoft Word file format; it is used in the open source word 
processing program named Writer, which comes as part of the Apache OpenOffice suite. 
ODT can be opened and edited using any OpenOffice-compatible program, including 
Chapter 4  SearCh engine teChniqueS
171
NeoOffice (Mac), AbiWord (Mac and Windows), and KWord (Unix). You can also open 
ODT files using Microsoft Word and save them as DOCX files.
 XLS and XLSX
XLS and XLSX are file formats for Microsoft Excel used to create spreadsheets. Older 
editions have the .xsl extension, while modern Microsoft Excel files (beginning with 
2007) have the .xslx extension. Excel is part of the Microsoft Office suite created by 
Microsoft.
 ODS
ODS stands for OpenDocument Spreadsheet; this format was created by the Calc 
program that is included in the Apache OpenOffice suite. ODS files can be opened and 
edited using any OpenOffice-compatible program, including NeoOffice (Mac) and 
LibreOffice (Mac and Windows). They can also be opened in Microsoft Excel and saved 
as XLS or XLSX files.
 PPT and PPTX
PPT and PPTX are file format for Microsoft PowerPoint that are used for creating 
multimedia presentations. Just like with the Excel and Word programs, .ppt is used for 
older editions, while .pptx is used in modern Microsoft PowerPoint editions.
 ODP
ODP stands for OpenDocument Presentation. It is used in the Apache OpenOffice 
Impress program, which comes as part of the OpenOffice suite. Microsoft PowerPoint 
can be used to open or save a presentation in the ODP format.
