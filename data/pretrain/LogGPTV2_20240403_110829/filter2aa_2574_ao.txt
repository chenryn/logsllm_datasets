### Website History and Website Capture
Sometimes, you may need to go back in time to investigate something from the past. Website capture is useful for online investigations because it allows you to ensure that a snapshot of a given website remains available even if the original page disappears. Please note that saved pages are typically stored without their associated scripts, so some functionality, themes, and menus may not work correctly.

There are several online services that offer website archiving. Here are some of the most popular ones:

- **Internet Archive (Wayback Machine; https://archive.org/web/web.php)**: The most popular archive site, with over 308 billion web pages saved over time. Anyone can capture a web page as it appears now for future reference (the captured website should allow crawlers). See Figure 4-14.
- **Archive (https://archive.fo/)**: Another reliable archiving service.
- **Cached Pages (www.cachedpages.com/)**: Shows previous versions of websites captured on three different archive websites (Google cache, Coral, and Archive.org).
- **Screenshots.com**: Provides a history of screenshots for any website.
- **Way Backpack (https://github.com/jsvine/waybackpack)**: A tool that allows you to download the entire Wayback Machine archive for a given web page.
- **Library of Congress (https://loc.gov/websites)**: Offers an extensive collection of archived websites.
- **UK Web Archive (www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa)**: Archives UK-based websites.
- **Stanford Web Archive Portal (https://swap.stanford.edu)**: Provides access to a variety of web archives.
- **Oldweb.today (http://oldweb.today)**: Retrieves archived web pages from different public Internet archives and allows you to view them using different web browsers.
- **UK Government Web Archive (www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/webarchive/)**: Holds U.K. government web archives published since 1996, including videos, tweets, and web pages.

### Website Monitoring Services
If you need to be alerted about changes to specific websites, there are many online services that can help. These services send you an alert email or SMS when a change is detected on a specific page. Here are some of the major free and paid website-monitoring services:

- **Google Alerts (https://www.google.com/alerts; see Figure 4-15)**: A web content change detection and notification service offered by Google. To set an alert, sign into your Google account, enter the search phrase or word, and Google will notify you by email when the specified search phrase or word appears in newly indexed search results.
- **Talk Walker (www.talkwalker.com/alerts)**: An alternative to Google Alerts.
- **Visual Ping (https://visualping.io)**: Monitors web pages for any detected change; the free account offers 62 checks per month.
- **Follow That Page (https://www.followthatpage.com)**: Provides two daily checks with the free account.
- **Watch That Page (www.watchthatpage.com)**: Offers 70 weekly checks on all your pages.
- **Update Scanner (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner)**: A Firefox extension that monitors web pages for updates.

### RSS Feeds
Another method to monitor website changes is to use an RSS feed. RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary and is an XML file that allows site owners to inform subscribed readers about new content. To check for new site updates, a user needs an RSS feed reader. Subscribing to a website's RSS feed will automatically notify the user of any updates, eliminating the need to visit the site continually.

Major web browsers offer built-in RSS support. For example, Mozilla Firefox has Live Bookmarks. To subscribe to an RSS feed in Firefox:

1. Navigate to the website where you want to subscribe to its RSS feed.
2. From the Bookmarks menu, select "Subscribe to This Page" (if the browser does not detect an RSS feed, this option will be grayed out). Then select your feed.
3. Confirm your subscription using the Firefox subscription box at the top. Set the options as shown in Figure 4-17.
4. Click "Subscribe Now," and a pop-up message will appear allowing you to change the feed name and location. Hit "Subscribe" and you are done!

**Figure 4-17.** Click the "Subscribe Now" button to subscribe to the intended RSS feed

For more advanced features, consider using dedicated desktop RSS feed reader software like RSSOwl (www.rssowl.org/), which offers powerful features such as searching within feeds, saving previous searches, and receiving notifications on new content.

### News Search
News sources are a rich repository of information. For instance, corporations can gain insights into competitors' legal history, partnership agreements, financial status, and negative mentions by searching news archives. This applies to governments, nonprofit organizations, and high-profile individuals as well.

#### Customize Google News
Google News aggregates news from various sources around the world. To customize Google News for specific topics or keywords:

1. Go to https://news.google.com.
2. Click "Manage sections" on the left side of the page (see Figure 4-18).
3. Enter the topic or keywords in the "Search terms" text box, name the search, and click "Add Section."

A new section will appear in the left vertical menu of Google News. To search for specific keywords, click the section name, and Google will display the relevant news search results.

#### Fake News Detection
In the digital age, fake news can spread rapidly through social media platforms. Detecting and combating fake news is a critical task. Major social platforms like Twitter and Facebook are working on solutions to reduce the harm of fake news. As an OSINT investigator, you should use the following checklist to verify suspicious news:

1. Read the entire article or piece of information first.
2. Check the source of the news.
3. If the source is credible (e.g., a well-known news agency):
   - Go to the source's website to confirm the information.
4. If the source is unknown:
   - Conduct an online search to see if other credible sources have published the same news.
   - If a credible source confirms the story, it is likely true.
   - Otherwise, further investigation is needed.

**Warning!** Do not trust information published only on social sites. Conduct an online search to verify the news. If you find false information, report it to the site operators.

There are many online tools to help identify fake news:

### Searching for Digital Files
Digital files constitute a significant portion of web content. With the availability of free cloud file-hosting services (Dropbox, Google Drive) and video-sharing sites (YouTube), individuals and corporations often use these services for online sharing. Digital files can contain valuable information, both in their contents and metadata.

#### Document Search
This section covers common document file formats available online:

- **DOC and DOCX**: Standard file formats for Microsoft Word documents. .doc is for older versions (2003 and earlier), while .docx is for newer versions (2007 and later).
- **HTML and HTM**: Standard web page file formats. Both extensions can be used interchangeably. HTML files can be edited with any text editor but displayed using a web browser.
- **ODT**: Text document format used in the open-source word processing program Writer (part of Apache OpenOffice). ODT files can be opened and edited using any OpenOffice-compatible program, including Microsoft Word.
- **XLS and XLSX**: File formats for Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. .xls is for older versions, while .xlsx is for newer versions (2007 and later).
- **ODS**: OpenDocument Spreadsheet format used in the Calc program (part of Apache OpenOffice). ODS files can be opened and edited using any OpenOffice-compatible program, including Microsoft Excel.
- **PPT and PPTX**: File formats for Microsoft PowerPoint presentations. .ppt is for older versions, while .pptx is for newer versions.

By understanding these file formats, you can effectively search for and utilize digital documents in your investigations.
