Assistant: This log chunk is related to the execution of task 1239 in stage 26. The task is split into multiple parts, which are read from hdfs://10.10.34.11:9000/pjhe/logs/2kSOSP.log. The results of the task are stored in memory as blocks rdd_42_35, rdd_42_37, rdd_42_36, rdd_42_38, and rdd_42_39. The total, boot, init, and finish times for each part of the task are also logged. Finally, the task is completed and the result is sent to the driver.
