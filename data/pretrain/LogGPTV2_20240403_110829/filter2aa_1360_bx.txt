The following is a sample list of personal web page addresses from additional internet providers, using 
"crazycheetah70" as a username example. You should also search for internet providers in the target's area and 
attempt to find deleted pages on The Wayback Machine, Google Cache, Bing Cache, Yandex Cache, and the 
other sendees discussed in Chapter Nine.

It should be noted diat some institutions will not follow a standard naming convention for all students and 
faculty. Additionally, there will be occasions when two or more students will have a name similar enough to 
create the same username. Usually, there is a plan in place to thwart these duplications. Sometimes it is as simple 
as adding die number "2" after the username. Universities are not the only places that create personal web pages 
based on a member name. Several internet service providers allow each subscriber a personal space online as 
part of the provider's main website. Comcast provides 25MB of storage in a folder with the ride of the 
subscriber's username. For example, if the email address of die customer was PI:EMAIL, the 
username for the sendee would be crazycheetah70. The URL to view the personal web page would be as follows.

This service appears to rely on the exact same database as True People Search. However, it possesses one hugy 
advantage. True People Search gained a lot of media attention as a "stalking" assistant, which resulted in 
numerous articles instructing individuals to remove their profiles with an opt-out link. Many people have 
removed their information, but practically none of them replicated the procedure on Fast People Search. If your 
target removed his or her profile from the prexdous option, it might still be present here. The direct search URL 
is as follows.
This service has provided the most comprehensive and consistent free report based on real name. The results 
usually include current address, prex’ious addresses, telephone numbers (including cellular), email addresses, 
relatives, and associates. There are no blatant ads, but the "Background Reports" links forward you to a paid 
service xvhich xvill likely return the same details. This is my first stop xvhen trying to locate an individual in the 
U.S. The direct search URL is as folloxvs.
A newcomer in 2017 xvas Nuwber. I first learned about this sendee from various members of the privacy forum 
at my xvebsite. They were discussing the importance of removing their own personal details from this site 
through x'arious opt-out procedures available at the time. I found my own information to be quite accurate. 
Therefore, this makes for a great OSINT resource. The default landing page allows search of a first and last 
name. The results are presented by location, and each profile often includes full name, age range, home address, 
telephone number, and neighbors. The direct search URL is as folloxvs.
Just as Google and Bing specialize in searching content on the internet, people search engines specialize in 
finding content about a particular person. Many of these sites utilize search engines such as Google and Bing to 
help compile the data, and then present a summary style interface that is easy to consume. The sites listed here 
each have their own strengths and xveaknesses. Standard searches are free on all of them; however, each site 
generates revenue in some form. Usually, this is by displaying advertisements that often appear to be a report 
function xvithin the site. I do not recommend purchasing any of the premium paid sendees until all free options 
have been exhausted.
These details are often focused on targets in the United States, but many services are starting to reach past North 
America. Searching a target's real name often leads to the discover)' of home addresses, telephone numbers, 
email accounts, and usernames. The folloxxdng resources are presented in order of most beneficial within my 
investigations to least. Please note that many of these sites are now blocking access from IP addresses associated 
with VPNs. This is due to malicious "scraping" behavior by competing sites. If you receive an "access denied" 
error, it is likely your VPN is being blocked by the sendee.

280 Chapter 17
I suspect this site is associated to the first two entries in this chapter. However, I have located unique data. 
Therefore, it should be included in our tools. The direct search URL follows.
In 2016, this website emerged and launched an uproar online. This site is targeted toward those who want to 
conduct family history research, and its specialty is connecting a person to his or her relatives. The results do 
not display home addresses, but simply the age of the target and a large list of family members. After gaining a 
lot of online popularity, many people started complaining about the availability of this sensitive information. 
'While this type of sendee is nothing new, people were outraged at this violation of their privacy. Since Family 
Tree Now sources all of their data from public databases, they defended their product, which is still available 
today. This attention may have been the inspiration for this company to take things to another level with True 
People Search. The direct search URL is as follows.
This service has many similarities to Intelius. However, the data set is unique. The business model is to entice 
you into purchasing an entire profile. I only use the service for the limited free content available in the preview. 
After searching a name, select the most appropriate target and choose "Full Profile" in the lower right of the 
result This will open the full view of any free information. This will often include the target's middle name, age, 
current address, previous address, landline telephone number, and links to social networks. The Background 
Check options forward you to a premium website which 1 do not recommend. The direct URL follows.
This was another service that surprised many privacy-conscious people. A typical entry' contains a target's full 
name, current home address, current home telephone number, email addresses, previous home addresses, 
additional telephone numbers, possible relatives, and age. I recently located a target's email address from this 
sendee, which was not present on any other site. Using the techniques mentioned in previous chapters, I was 
able to create a full dossier. The default page does not present a direct URL, but the inspector presents following.
Intelius is a premium sendee that provides reports about people for a fee. Most of the information is from public 
sources, but some of it appears to come from private databases. Searching for any’ information on the main 
website will always link you to a menu of pricing options. The information will never be displayed for free. 
However, the page that lists the report options does possess some interesting information. This free preview 
identifies an exact age, possible aliases, cities lived in, previous employers, universities attended, and relatives. If 
the subject is married, this will usually identify' the spouse. In most situations, it will identify the maiden name 
of the person's wife. Anything that you do not see on this main screen, you must pay’ a fee. I never recommend 
purchasing any of this data. Users are usually disappointed with the results. The direct search URL is as follows.

This database looks awfully familiar to True People Search and Fast People Search, but I occasionally locate an 
individual present here and nowhere else. One benefit here is that the email addresses identified within the 
results are hyperlinks. They connect to additional names on occasion. The direct search URL is as follows.
Spokeo is probably the most well-known of aU the people search engines. There are two very distinct versions 
of this sendee, free and premium. The premium service wiU provide a large amount of accurate data, but at a 
cost. The free version provides an interface that is easy to navigate. The results from a target name search will 
be presented after choosing a state and city. Only the states and cities where the target name has a presence will 
be shown. Choosing this target will display a profile with various information. Within this data wall be several 
attempts to encourage you to purchase a premium account. Basically, anything that you do not see within this 
profile will cost you money. Any links from the profile wiU present a membership plan with pricing. The profile 
will often display fuU name, gender, age, and previous cities and states of residency. However, it no longer 
presents the actual current address. Spokeo is one of many sites which present an animate gif file while you wait 
on the results. This is unnecessary’ and is in place to make you believe data is being queried in real time. The 
following static search URL bypasses this annoyance.
This is another service which includes advertisements for premium options. It appears to present data very 
similar to Intelius. Surprisingly, the majority’ of their data archive is free without any payment. The main search 
results appear redacted and entire addresses and telephone numbers are masked. With many otlier sendees, 
clicking these details prompt the user for payment. Instead, this service opens a new page revealing the entire
In late 2014, a new website quietly entered the crowded scene of people search services. On the surface, it was 
just another service that aggregated publicly available information. Consequently, a closer examination revealed 
That's Them to contain information that is not available anywhere else for free. This sendee has many options, 
and most will be discussed in this book. For the purposes of this chapter, I will focus on the "Name and Address" 
search option in the top menu of the website. Entering a full name with city and state is preferred, but not 
required. Results often display the person's age range, cell phone number, landline number, full address, religion, 
financial details, home IP address and any associated email addresses. I searched my own name to test the 
accuracy’ of the results. My profile correcdy identified similar information as well as the exact VIN number of a 
previous vehicle. This type of data is impressive without any fees. I have found their details of religion and 
financial information to be unreliable. Note that the options to purchase additional information are 
advertisements from third-party companies, and should be avoided. The direct search URL is as follows.
This sendee provides limited data during a free search, but the records are often updated from premium 
resources. In my experience, the free option only provides city, state, and phone. The direct URL follows.

record. This often includes home address, home landline telephone number, age, and relatives. Clicking the "See 
full info" button reveals previous addresses, additional telephone numbers, and aliases. Overall, this sendee is 
extremely useful for U.S. targets. The direct search URL is as follows.
On the surface, Yasni appears to be another standard people search engine. Much of the content received will 
be duplicate data, but there are a few areas where Yasni works differently. The home page will give three search 
options. For most OS1NT purposes, the last option is the desired search. It will accept a real name or username 
and forward you to a results page. Real name search will present a large number of links associated with your 
target's name. As with other engines, many of these results will be about a person other than your target The 
first box on the results page will include a "lives/works in" option that will display the cities of the users identified 
with the search. Clicking on a location that looks appropriate for your target will load a new results page that 
will provide all search results about your specific target Yasni will identify news articles, websites, and social 
networks related to your target. By default, the search is conducted internationally. Yasni is a German site and 
searching outside of the United States is one of the strengths of the service. The search bar includes an option 
to filter the results by specific countries, but the United States is not listed as an option. If you have a target that 
lives in another country, Yasni is a great tool. The direct search URL is as follows.
This site appears to have several search options at first glance. Unfortunately, all but one will forward to an 
Intelius site, which will require a fee. There is one very specific free option on this page. Providing any real name 
and state of residence will provide a results page with full name, date of birth, address, and phone number. In 
my experience, this often includes unlisted telephone numbers and addresses. Clicking on practically anything 
else on this results page will take you to a sponsored link. When I use this resource, I only rely on the information 
obtained on the first result page. The direct search URL is as follows.
This service emphasizes information associated with social networks. I have never located any home addresses 
or telephone numbers, but I have found online images that were not available on any other search engine. This 
is not the most productive option, but one to consider when desperate for details. The direct search URL is as 
follows.
This database appears to have the same parent company as True People Search, and possesses the same data. 
However, this search should be included in the event that a target has removed details from other related 
websites. Due to increased awareness of exposed personal information, I am seeing many people request 
removal of personal online data. The direct URL is as follows.

Public Records (publicrecords.directory)
This is the official White Pages website that will conduct a reverse name or address search. The results often 
include known residents and neighbors. This data is pulled from public information and is rarely complete. The 
direct search URL is as follows.
There is nothing too exciting here, as it is more of the same, 
should add it to our arsenal. The URL structure follows.
Since this service offers a direct URL query, we
I explained this service within the username chapter, but it also applies here. It focuses on social media presence, 
including mentions within posts. The direct search URL is as follows.
This service possesses a database identical to many of the better options previously presented. It also appears 
that records are not being updated and the details are becoming quite stale. This can be a good thing. If you 
target has moved and established a new address publicly, Find People Search might be the only option which 
displays a previous address. There is no direct URL submission option, so a manual search is your only option.
There is nothing very special about this service, as it will likely have data similar to the other sites already 
mentioned. However, there is one major annoyance. When you search this site, you are bombarded by fake 
progress meters that insinuate that a huge report is being prepared about your target. On average, a real name 
search takes over 14 minutes due to these constant "please be patient while we find more details" notifications. 
The solution to this is to submit a direct URL as follows.
The title of this site is misleading. It only allows the query of a telephone number, which is not beneficial when 
searching by name. However, the following URL structure displays all profiles associated with the provided 
name.
This service displays a few unique details about an individual. It taps into various voter registration databases, 
campaign contribution disclosures, and vehicle registration data. None of these categories appear consistently 
within search results, but a search here is always justified. There is no direct URL submission option, so a manual 
search is your only option.
