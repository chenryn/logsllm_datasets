Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

I navigated to **Tools > Plugins** in NetBeans and installed the three Python-related items that appeared. After the installation, I selected the option to restart NetBeans. However, instead of restarting, NetBeans closed and now it will not open. I typically use NetBeans 7 for Java development.

I am using macOS. 

Since there has been no response, I would like to ask: Is there a way to revert to the state before the new plugin installation?

**Response:**

I encountered the same issue after installing the Python plugin. To resolve this problem, I deleted the `org-openide-awt.jar` file located in the following directory: `C:\Users\USERNAME\.netbeans\7.0\modules`.

Best regards,
Mart√≠n

P.S.: I am using NetBeans 7.0.1 on Windows 7 64-bit.
