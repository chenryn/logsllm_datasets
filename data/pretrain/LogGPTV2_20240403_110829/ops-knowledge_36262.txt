User: I went to tools, plugins. Then chose to install the three python items that show up. After installation. I choose the restart netbeans option. But instead of restarting, netbeans just closed. And now it is not opening. Any ideas how to fix this? I normally develop Java on my netbeans 7 install.
I am using a mac osx
I see there are no takers, so let me ask this: Is there a way to revert to before the new plugin install?
Assistant: I have the same problem afther installing the python plguin. To solve this problem i deleted the file: org-openide-awt.jar from C:\Users\MYUSERNAME.netbeans\7.0\modules
Regards!

PD: I'm using Netbeans 7.0.1 anda Windows 7 64bit.
