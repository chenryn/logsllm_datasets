### Title: BlackHat Asia 2021 - The Tangled WebView: JavaScriptInterface Vulnerabilities Revisited

**Abstract:**

WebView is a widely used Android component that allows native applications to interact with web pages via the `addJavascriptInterface` method. While this feature is powerful, it also introduces significant security risks, such as those highlighted by CVE-2012-6336 and the "App Clone Attack." We have discovered a new class of vulnerabilities in Android WebView associated with JavaScriptInterface, which can bypass all existing verification mechanisms.

In this presentation, we will introduce a novel attack model for the first time. This attack targets WebView at a deeper level, enabling the invocation of JavaScriptInterface from any untrusted page, thereby bypassing all types of validation and restriction technologies. These vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including sensitive information leakage, identity theft, and remote code execution.

We will present three distinct vulnerability models, each capable of facilitating an attack. Additionally, we will delve into the architecture of WebView to explain the root cause of these vulnerabilities. To assist in identifying these vulnerabilities, we have developed an innovative tool that can automatically vet Android applications.

Our research has shown that many high-profile applications are affected, impacting more than 60% of Android devices and at least 2 billion users. Furthermore, this type of vulnerability can be extended to other platforms, such as iOS or Electron.

To address these issues, we propose a practical mitigation measure called "RichInterface," which we have implemented in a custom WebView. Our evaluation of real-world applications demonstrates that this solution is effective, scalable, and incurs minimal overhead.

Our goal is to protect users from potential security risks while still allowing them to benefit from the convenience of WebView and JavaScriptInterface. We also aim to raise awareness within the security community about this emerging attack method.
