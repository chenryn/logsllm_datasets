User: Assuming you want to build a highly available distributed system, please provide a system design plan, including system architecture, load balancing, fault recovery, etc.
Assistant: System architecture: A high-availability distributed system can adopt a master-slave structure, with multiple master nodes and one slave node. The master nodes are responsible for the same functions, and the slave nodes mainly perform data backup and fault-tolerant processing. Each master node has its own independent computing resources and storage resources, so that even if a master node fails, other master nodes can still work normally. A distributed system can adopt a microservice architecture to split services, reduce coupling between services, and improve system scalability. Load balancing: Using load balancing can balance the load between each master node or microservice to ensure the load balance of each node. Load balancing can be implemented through a hardware load balancer or a software load balancer. In the software load balancer, load balancing algorithms based on round robin, random, and least connections can be used for distribution. At the same time, a health check mechanism can also be set to ensure that the load balancer can detect faulty nodes or services and avoid allocating requests to faulty nodes or services. Fault recovery: In a highly available distributed system, a fault recovery mechanism and a fault tolerance mechanism should be set up to solve the fault problem through a backup mechanism and a redundancy mechanism. For example, backup replication technology can be used to replicate data to other nodes. When a node fails, the backup node can be used for fault recovery. In addition, remote multi-active technology can be used to build system nodes in different geographic locations to ensure that even if a disaster occurs in one geographic location, the system can still work normally in other geographic locations. Summary: A highly available distributed system needs to consider system architecture, load balancing, and fault recovery. Adopt a master-slave structure, split microservices, and use technical means such as hardware or software load balancers, backup replication, and redundancy mechanisms to ensure system availability. At the same time, you can also consider using multiple geographical locations and remote multi-active technology to ensure that the system can operate normally in the event of a failure.
