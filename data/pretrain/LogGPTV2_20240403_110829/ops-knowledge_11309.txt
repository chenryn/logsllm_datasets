I have written a simple Python script using the Windows version, which is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.4. The script currently starts with `#! /usr/bin/python` to specify the interpreter. Will this script run as-is on a Mac? I would like to know this before distributing it to Mac users, as I do not have a Mac to test it on.

**Response:**

To ensure your script runs correctly on both Windows and Mac, you should use `#!/usr/bin/env python` as the first line of your script. This shebang line uses the `env` command to locate the Python interpreter in the user's environment, making it more portable across different systems.

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Your Python code here
```

After making this change, you can make the script executable (on Unix-like systems, such as macOS) by running:

```sh
chmod +x script.py
```

Then, you can run the script directly:

```sh
./script.py
```

This approach will help ensure that your script runs correctly on both Windows and Mac, provided the user has Python installed and available in their system path.
