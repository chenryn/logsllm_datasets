User: Iv'e written simple python script in the windows version.
written in python 2.7, code compatible to 3.4
runs as script with #! /usr/bin/python
Will it run as is on mac?
Would like to know this before i distribute it to mac users and don't have a mac machine to test it.
Assistant: You should use #!/usr/bin/env python as your first line in the script.
It will be applied when you make the script executable and run it like ./script.py
