Hi,
I just **upgraded from 1.8.4 to 1.9.0.1** and while my roles and inventory SSH
configuration are unchanged:
**Inventory SSH Configuration:**
    [group1:vars]
    ansible_ssh_user=deployment
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file=./files/dev/deployment_rsa
    ansible_sudo_pass=password123
**my_role/vars/main.yml:**
    ---
    sudo: yes
**This previously working task my_role/tasks/main.yml:**
    ---
    - name: install jdk
      yum: pkg=jdk-{{ jdk_package_version }} state=present
**is now failing with:**
    failed: [host1] => {"failed": true}
    msg: Error from repoquery: ['/usr/bin/repoquery', '--show-duplicates', '--plugins', '--quiet', '-q', '--disablerepo=*', '--pkgnarrow=installed', '--qf', '%{name}-%{version}-%{release}.%{arch}', 'jdk-1.2.27.1.0-3707']: Could not set cachedir: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/var/tmp/yum-deployment-aVYwNt'
    Error: Could not make cachedir, exiting
whereas before the ansible upgrade it was working fine. I am **not** passing
any sudo / user related configuration in CLI.
If I add sudo: yes to every task in the tasks/main.yml it works, but clearly
this is not something I want to do.
Has something changed in the sudo / user precedence in the new ansible version
that I should know about? This seems like a bug to me but I could be wrong..
Thanks in advance,  
Yannis
