User: Please write a program in Python to get the HTTP response code of a specific website and automatically send an email to notify the administrator.
Assistant: The following is a sample program that uses Python to get the HTTP response code of a website and send an email: ```python import requests import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText # Set the URL of the website to be queried url = "https://www.example .com" # Initiate HTTP GET request and get response code response = requests.get(url) status_code = response.status_code # Set email content subject = "Website Status Alert" body = f"The website {url} returned a status code of {status_code}. Please check it out." message = MIMEText(body) message['subject'] = subject message['to'] = "admin@example.com" message['from'] = "website_monitor@example. com" # Send an email to notify the administrator with smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587) as smtp: smtp.ehlo() smtp.starttls() smtp.ehlo() smtp.login('website_monitor@example. com', 'password') smtp.send_message(message) ``` In the above sample program, we use the Python requests library to get the HTTP response code of the website, and use the smtplib library to send an email to notify the administrator. Please note that you need to replace the "url", "to" and "from" parameters in the sample program with your own information, and set the correct SMTP server address, port number, sender email address and password. Additionally, you need to enable SMTP access for your sender email.
