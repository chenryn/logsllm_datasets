### B. Improvements in Privacy Settings Design

In the case of Baidu Maps (refer to Section V-B), the 10.1.0 version, released on February 2, 2018, introduced a new view titled "Track Setting" to consolidate privacy-related settings. Additionally, an indicator was added under the "Privacy Settings" view to direct users to this new section, making it more accessible.

Another example is the BMW Motorrad Connected app, which includes a privacy setting labeled "Help us improve the range of products from BMW Motorrad." This setting allows users to control whether the app can collect location, trace, and other usage data in the background. In the older version (1.3), this setting was located under "Legal Notices," which was not intuitive. In the updated version (1.4.2), the setting was moved to a more appropriate "Data Privacy" view, enhancing its visibility.

Similar improvements have been observed in other popular apps, such as KingsChat (with over 500,000 downloads) and Web Browser (with over 10 million downloads). Among the 132 apps analyzed, 98 had been downloaded more than 100,000 times, and 54 had been installed over 1 million times. This suggests that developers of popular apps are increasingly prioritizing the design and usability of privacy settings.

### D. Default Privacy Leakage

The issue of hidden privacy settings becomes even more critical when these settings are configured to leak private information by default. For instance, Facebook has 34 privacy settings, with 22 set to leak privacy by default, including 12 hidden settings.

To further investigate this, we randomly selected 100 English apps from Google Play and 100 Chinese apps from Baidu Market, manually checking 599 privacy settings. The results were alarming: 469 (78.30%) privacy settings were set to leak privacy by default (79.03% for English apps and 77.41% for Chinese apps, as shown in Table VIII). Among the hidden privacy settings, 82.16% were set to leak by default, making it difficult for users to quickly identify and adjust these settings to protect their privacy. These settings cover all six categories listed in Table I.

We also categorized the privacy settings and hidden ones across the 200 apps, as detailed in Table IX. Surprisingly, 100% of users' social connections were exposed by default, with about one-third of these settings being hidden, making it challenging for users to disable them.

Furthermore, participants reported that some privacy setting descriptions were confusing. For example, a setting labeled "Hide location" might be off by default, leading users to believe their location is hidden when it is not. Similar misleading texts include "Do not show people I follow and groups I’ve joined" in the Blued app (over 14 million downloads) and "Do not show my listening history to friends" in QQ Music (over 550 million downloads in China). Our analysis of 599 privacy settings in the 200 apps found that 21.87% (20.05% for English apps and 24.07% for Chinese apps) had this issue. Most users leave these settings unchanged, inadvertently leaking their personal information.

### VI. Suggestions for Developers

Based on our findings, the problem of hidden privacy settings is both severe and widespread. There is an urgent need for clear guidance on designing privacy settings. While companies like Google and Apple provide general UI design principles, they do not specifically address privacy settings. The GSMA's "Privacy Design Guidelines for Mobile Application Development" [3] require developers to ensure that default settings are privacy-protective and easy to understand, but they lack detailed recommendations. To assist developers, we offer the following suggestions based on our human subject studies and measurements:

- **Consistent UI Paths:** All privacy settings should start with the path `Settings → Privacy Settings`. This helps users locate settings easily and avoids misplacement in irrelevant views. For settings that logically belong in multiple places, additional entries should be provided. For example, a "Share Location" setting should have an entry under both "Privacy Settings" and "Location Settings."

- **Avoid Cluttered Views:** Avoid placing too many UI elements in a single view. Use nested views to group related settings, ensuring that all elements fit on one screen. This reduces the likelihood of hidden settings.

- **Concise Texts and Separate Descriptions:** Keep the text of privacy settings short and concise. Detailed explanations should be separated from the main text to avoid overwhelming users.

- **Use Typical Icons with Text Descriptions:** Users often find non-typical icons confusing. Use standard icons and provide text descriptions to clarify their meaning.

- **Clear On/Off States:** Design privacy settings so that "on" means sharing information and "off" means stopping sharing. This aligns with user expectations and reduces unintentional privacy leaks.

In addition to these suggestions, our tool Hound can help developers identify hidden privacy settings before releasing their apps. Once identified, developers can use our guidelines to improve their UI design.

### VII. Limitations

**User Study:**
- **Sample Size and Representativeness:** The difficulty level of each privacy setting was quantified using the average score from five participants, which may lack representativeness. However, the high Fleiss’s kappa (71.93%) indicates substantial agreement among participants.
- **Participant Background:** 57.26% of participants from China work in computer science or related fields, potentially skewing the results. Including a more diverse participant pool would enhance the study's generalizability.
- **App Familiarity:** Ideally, participants should have used all the apps evaluated. However, this was impractical, so we required at least one year of mobile app experience and asked if they had used the app before. Our research shows that prior app use does not significantly affect their ability to set privacy settings (t-test, p > 0.8).

**Technique:**
- **Obfuscation and Dynamic Loading:** Hound uses semantics-based UI tracing to handle obfuscation, but it cannot identify settings loaded dynamically from the internet. In our sample of 200 apps, only one (0.5%) was fully obfuscated, and nine (4.5%) loaded settings dynamically. These cases were not considered in our research.

### VIII. Related Work

**Mobile Privacy Protection:**
- Android's permission-based security model restricts app access to user data. Previous work has focused on configuring permissions and enhancing the system, but these efforts primarily address limited personal data (e.g., contacts and location). Our research extends to broader privacy settings beyond system permissions.

**Mobile App Usability:**
- Many studies focus on general UI design principles, but few concentrate on the usability of privacy settings. Our research addresses the challenge of locating privacy settings, a crucial first step in ensuring their usability.

**UI-Paths Analysis:**
- Previous studies have extracted UI-paths using Android API calls, but they often fail to identify the indicators linking views. Hound uses semantics-based UI tracing to correlate indicators with views, providing a more accurate and comprehensive approach.

### IX. Conclusion

This paper presents the first large-scale measurement study on the accessibility of privacy settings. Through two user studies, we identified six root causes of hidden privacy settings and developed 14 features to detect them. We built Hound, a tool with 93.54% accuracy, to recover and identify problematic privacy settings. Analyzing 100,000 apps from Google Play and third-party markets, we found that 36.29% of privacy settings are hidden, with 82.16% of these settings leaking user data by default. The problem has worsened from 2017 to 2018, likely due to fundamental design issues. Finally, we provide five practical suggestions for developers to improve the design and usability of privacy settings.
