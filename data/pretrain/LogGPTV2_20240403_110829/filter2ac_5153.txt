### Title: BlackHat US-21: IPvSeeYou - Exploiting Leaked Identifiers in IPv6 for Street-Level Geolocation

**Abstract:**

IP geolocation, which ties an IP address to a physical location, is widely used but often provides only coarse, city-level accuracy that can be inaccurate. With "IPvSeeYou," we present a data fusion attack targeting residential home routers using IPv6, enabling *street-level* geolocation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IPvSeeYou by precisely geolocating millions of home routers deployed globally.

**Introduction:**

Current IP geolocation techniques and tools generally provide only city-level accuracy, which is often insufficient and prone to errors. In this research, we introduce "IPvSeeYou," a novel method that leverages leaked identifiers in IPv6 addresses to achieve street-level geolocation. Our approach assumes a weak adversary who is remote from the target and has no privileged access.

**Methodology:**

The core of our privacy attack lies in the use of EUI-64 IPv6 addresses, which embed the interface's hardware MAC address within the IPv6 address. Although most modern operating systems no longer use EUI-64, it remains common in legacy and low-profit-margin customer premises equipment (CPE), such as commodity routers used in residential and business settings. 

In IPv6, CPEs are typically routed hops, unlike the NATs in IPv4, allowing us to discover their MAC addresses via traceroute if they use EUI-64. These CPEs often integrate Wi-Fi functionality, and the MAC address of the Wi-Fi interface is frequently related to the MAC address of the wide area interface, often differing by a small offset (e.g., Â±1). The Wi-Fi MAC addresses (802.11 BSSIDs) are broadcast and captured in wardriving databases, which also record their physical locations.

By correlating the MAC addresses embedded in IPv6 home router addresses with their corresponding Wi-Fi BSSIDs, we can remotely geolocate these devices, fusing virtual data with real-world locations.

**Implementation:**

To demonstrate the practicality of IPvSeeYou, we developed an Internet-scale IPv6 router discovery technique that identified tens of millions of deployed CPEs with EUI-64 addresses. We then mapped these addresses on a per-OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) basis to their corresponding Wi-Fi BSSIDs. By searching for these BSSIDs in geolocation databases, we successfully mapped millions of routers across the world to precise physical locations.

**Conclusion:**

"IPvSeeYou" represents a significant advancement in IP geolocation, providing street-level accuracy by exploiting the vulnerabilities in EUI-64 IPv6 addresses. This method not only highlights the potential privacy risks associated with legacy CPEs but also demonstrates the power of data fusion in achieving highly accurate geolocation.
