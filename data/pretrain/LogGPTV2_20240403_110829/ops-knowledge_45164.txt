User: Please explain what a reverse proxy is and what it does. And provide at least two reverse proxy servers.
Assistant: Reverse proxy is a server technology. When a client requests a server, the proxy server accepts the request and forwards the request to the target server. The target server responds with data to the proxy server, and the proxy server returns the data to the client. The reverse proxy server behaves as a request recipient externally, and internally as a visitor of the target web server. The role of the reverse proxy is to hide the real address of the target server, improve the security of the server, and distribute requests through load balancing, so that the target server can bear a greater load. In addition, the reverse proxy can also accelerate the access speed of static resources, that is, by caching related static resource responses, thereby improving the response speed. At least two reverse proxy servers: 1. Nginx: It is an open source high-performance reverse proxy server with very fast speed and supports high concurrency, load balancing, hot deployment and other functions. Can be used to build static resource servers or load balancing servers. 2. Apache: It is a powerful reverse proxy server that supports a variety of services and modules. It can be used in scenarios such as reverse proxy, load balancing, and cache acceleration. The advantage of Apache is that it is extremely flexible and supports custom configuration and custom modules.
