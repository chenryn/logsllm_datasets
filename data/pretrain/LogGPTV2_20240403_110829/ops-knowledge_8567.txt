User: I am facing the following error on configuring Appium python test in AWS device farm:

There was a problem processing your file. We found at least one wheel file wheelhouse/numpy-1.12.0-cp27-cp27m-macosx_10_6_intel.macosx_10_9_intel.macosx_10_9_x86_64.macosx_10_10_intel.macosx_10_10_x86_64.whl specified a platform that we do not support. Please unzip your test package and then open the wheelhouse directory, verify that names of wheel files end with -any.whl or -linux_x86_64.whl, and try again

I require numpy and opencv-python packages to run my tests.
How to get this issue fixed?
Assistant: (numpy-1.12.0-cp27-cp27m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl) is numpy wheel for ubuntu.
 But still Amazon device farm throws error while configuring tests with this wheel.
Basically, Device farm is validating if the .whl file has prefix  -none-any.whl
Just renaming the file to numpy-1.12.0-cp27-none-any.whl works in device farm.
Note: This renamed file is non-universal python wheel. There might be few things which are not implemented in non-universal python wheel. This may cause somethings to break. So, test to ensure all your dependencies are working fine before using this.
