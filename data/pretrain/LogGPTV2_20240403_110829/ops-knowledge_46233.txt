User: What will be the fastest way to check whether a folder size is beyond a specific size say 10 MB, 1 Gb , 10 GB etc, without actually calculating the folder size. Something like quota. A Pythonic solution will be great, but standard UNIX utilities also welcome
Assistant: I'd have to say it's impossible. I don't believe any filesystems cache folder sizes. Whatever you do is going to have to walk the tree in some fashion or another. Using du is probably the fastest method since it's all going to be happening in C.
If you know the maximum filesize expected or supported you could perhaps optimise a little by counting the enties in each folder rather than the sizes and short-cutting in the case where there aren't enough files to meet the limit.
