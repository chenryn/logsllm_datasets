(b) The Median Value of TTC using Uncertainty-

Figure 7: Maximum / Median tracking duration for different
privacy algorithms in high density scenarios (2000 vehicles /
1600 sqm). The Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm outper-
forms random sampling for a given number of released location
samples.
As evident from the data, the uncertainty-aware privacy algo-
rithm effectively limits time to confusion to 5 min, except for very
low privacy settings (i.e., low uncertainty threshold less than 0.4),
while the random sampling algorithm allows some vehicles to be
tracked up to about 35min. Our proposed algorithm can release up
to 92.5% of original location samples while achieving the bounded
tracking property.
In ﬁgure 7(b), we see that naturally occurring crossings and merges
in the paths of nearby vehicles lowers median TTC to 1 or 2 minutes
(with reacquisition it would be higher, though). However, with ran-
dom subsampling (20% removal), about 15% of vehicles (34 out of
233) can still be tracked longer than 10 minutes. The uncertainty-
aware path cloaking can guarantee the speciﬁed maximum track-
ing time of 5min even for these vehicles with higher data quality,
removing only 17.5% of samples.
5.2.2 Dependence on Reacquisition and Density
We now repeat the same experiment under the reacquisition track-
ing model, where an adversary may skip ahead over a point of con-
fusion. Figure 8(a) (note scaled x-axis) shows that the uncertainty-
aware privacy algorithm with reacquisition extensions can also ef-
fectively limit tracking time under this model, while subsampling
allows a worst case tracking time of 42 min. Figure 8(b) also shows
that the median tracking time is increased by one minute due to the
change in tracking model. The maximum allowable amount of re-
leased location samples is decreased compared to that of ﬁgure 7.

(b) The Median Value of TTC using the (with reac-
quisition) Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm
Figure 8: Maximum / Median tracking duration for different
privacy algorithms in high density scenarios (2000 vehicles /
1600 sqm) under the reacquisition tracking model.
Let us now investigate whether the privacy guarantee is also
maintained in a very low user density scenario with only 500 probe
vehicles. Figure 9 shows that this is indeed the case both with
and without the reacquisition model. While subsampling allows
a longer maximum TTC due to the low user density, our proposed
scheme still preserves the maximum TTC guarantee of 5 minutes
by removing 1.8% to 14.8% more samples (for uncertainty thresh-
olds between 0.4 and 0.99). The same result can be observed in
ﬁgure 9(b) with reacquisition, except that the difference in sam-
ples removed is not as pronounced. Compared to the high density
scenario, our proposed algorithm requires removing more samples
to achieve the bounded tracking property in the lower user density
scenario.
5.3 Quality of Service Analysis
So far, we have measured quality of service in terms of the per-
centage of samples removed by the algorithm. Since samples in
higher density areas are more important for the trafﬁc monitor-
ing application, the beneﬁts of our proposed privacy algorithm are
even more signiﬁcant if we consider relative weighted road cov-

erage. More details are shown in ﬁgure 10. Figure 11(b) fur-
ther shows that the uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm achieves
a relative weighted road coverage similar to that of original lo-
cation traces even though the actual number of released location
samples is lower than that of original location traces as shown in
ﬁgure 11(a). Figure 6 explains this results, in that the algorithm
retains most samples in high-density areas and removes most from
lower densities. However, the uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm
with reacquisition extensions provides a slight improvement of rel-
ative QoS for weighted road coverage. More detailed statistics on
this improvement are provided in table 3.
6. DISCUSSION
The following issues warrant a more detailed discussion.
Map-based Tracking. Tracking performance would likely be
improved by also considering road maps during the linking pro-
cess. For example, the adversary could assign a lower probability to
a segment if no direct road connection exists, even though the seg-
ment is near the predicted position. The algorithm could also adjust
the predicted location based on actual roadway positions [11]. To
counter this more sophisticated tracking, the bounded privacy algo-
rithm could also take these road maps into account when computing
entropy values. The complete analysis remains an open problem for
future work.
