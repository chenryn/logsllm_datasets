### 5.2.1 High-Density Scenarios

**Figure 7: Maximum and Median Tracking Duration for Different Privacy Algorithms in High-Density Scenarios (2000 Vehicles / 1600 sqm)**

- **(a) Maximum Value of Time to Confusion (TTC) using Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithm without Reacquisition**
  - The Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm effectively limits the TTC to 5 minutes, except for very low privacy settings (i.e., uncertainty threshold less than 0.4). In contrast, the random sampling algorithm allows some vehicles to be tracked for up to about 35 minutes.
  - Our proposed algorithm can release up to 92.5% of the original location samples while achieving the bounded tracking property.

- **(b) Median Value of TTC using Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithm without Reacquisition**
  - Naturally occurring crossings and merges in the paths of nearby vehicles lower the median TTC to 1 or 2 minutes. However, with random subsampling (20% removal), about 15% of vehicles (34 out of 233) can still be tracked for longer than 10 minutes.
  - The Uncertainty-aware path cloaking guarantees the specified maximum tracking time of 5 minutes even for these vehicles, removing only 17.5% of samples.

### 5.2.2 Dependence on Reacquisition and Density

**Figure 8: Maximum and Median Tracking Duration for Different Privacy Algorithms in High-Density Scenarios (2000 Vehicles / 1600 sqm) under the Reacquisition Tracking Model**

- **(a) Maximum Value of TTC using Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithm with Reacquisition**
  - The Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm with reacquisition extensions can effectively limit tracking time under this model, while subsampling allows a worst-case tracking time of 42 minutes.
  
- **(b) Median Value of TTC using Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithm with Reacquisition**
  - The median tracking time is increased by one minute due to the change in the tracking model. The maximum allowable amount of released location samples is decreased compared to that in Figure 7.

### 5.2.3 Low-Density Scenarios

**Figure 9: Maximum and Median Tracking Duration for Different Privacy Algorithms in Low-Density Scenarios (500 Vehicles / 1600 sqm)**

- **(a) Maximum Value of TTC using Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithm without Reacquisition**
  - The Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm maintains the maximum TTC guarantee of 5 minutes by removing 1.8% to 14.8% more samples (for uncertainty thresholds between 0.4 and 0.99).

- **(b) Maximum Value of TTC using Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithm with Reacquisition**
  - The same result is observed with reacquisition, but the difference in samples removed is not as pronounced. Compared to the high-density scenario, our proposed algorithm requires removing more samples to achieve the bounded tracking property in the lower user density scenario.

### 5.3 Quality of Service Analysis

**Figure 10: Quality of Service Metrics for Different Privacy Algorithms**

- **Table 3: Quality of Service Enhancement in Each of the Uncertainty-aware Privacy Algorithms and Random Sampling Compared to the QoS Level Achieved by Original Traces**
  - The Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm achieves a relative weighted road coverage similar to that of the original location traces, even though the actual number of released location samples is lower.
  - The algorithm retains most samples in high-density areas and removes most from lower densities. The Uncertainty-aware privacy algorithm with reacquisition extensions provides a slight improvement in relative QoS for weighted road coverage.

### 6. Discussion

**Map-based Tracking**
- Tracking performance would likely be improved by considering road maps during the linking process. For example, the adversary could assign a lower probability to a segment if no direct road connection exists, even though the segment is near the predicted position.
- The algorithm could also adjust the predicted location based on actual roadway positions [11]. To counter this more sophisticated tracking, the bounded privacy algorithm could take these road maps into account when computing entropy values. This remains an open problem for future work.
