Assistant: To ensure the availability and stability of the website, you need to pay attention to the following key skills and strategies: 1. Choose a reliable host and service provider: Selecting a reliable host and service provider is the basis for ensuring website availability and stability. It is recommended to choose a host and service provider with a good reputation and high-quality services. 2. Configure the backup and recovery plan: When the website fails or is attacked, the backup and recovery plan is the key to ensuring the availability and stability of the website. It is recommended to make a backup in time and configure the environment in use. 3. Keep your website's code and plugins updated: Constant software updates are key to keeping your website stable and usable. Keeping website code and plug-ins updated in a timely manner can reduce the occurrence of bugs and failures. 4. Strengthen security measures: Strengthening the security of the website can prevent hacking and malware infection. Keeping your website safe requires reliable security software and plugins to detect and prevent potential threats. 5. Perform performance monitoring and optimization: By monitoring website performance indicators and optimizing synchronization, it can help improve website performance and reduce the risk of failure. Routinely check performance and optimize the website to maintain good performance and user experience. 6. Configure an automated monitoring and response system: Configuring an automated monitoring and response system can help quickly discover problems and strengthen the management and maintenance of the website. Automated monitoring and response software can determine the type of problem and send early warning notifications on its own, reducing damage caused by delayed response to problems. 7. Use CDN caching mechanism: The CDN caching mechanism can effectively improve the loading speed of the website, reduce request delay and bandwidth blocking. Using the CDN cache as the front line, the traffic that needs to be processed can be distributed in different data centers, thereby reducing load balancing and processing bottlenecks. 8. Establish a high-availability architecture based on virtualization technology: Using virtualization technology to establish a high-availability architecture is an ideal solution to ensure website availability and stability. The virtualization architecture can improve hardware usage efficiency and load balancing capability, and effectively reduce the dependence on hardware.
