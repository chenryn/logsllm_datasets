2. Pigpen Cipher
The Pigpen Cipher is a simple substitution cipher based on a grid. Fig. 7.8 shows the
Pigpen Cipher symbols paired with letters. For example, if the plaintext *X marks
the spot”" is encrypted, the result is shown in Fig. 7.9.
7.2.3Shift Ciphers
1. Fence Cipher
Fence cipher is a method of dividing the plaintext into groups of N characters and
then joining the first character of each group to form a string. For encryption,
suppose the plaintext is “*wearefamily* and the key is “4", the key “4" is used to
divide the plaintext into groups of four characters each, “"wear Il efam Il ily". Then
take out the first, second and third letters of each group in turn, and forms °wei Il efl II
aay Il rm", and then join them together to get the ciphertext “weieflayrm".
2. Curve Cipher
Curve cipher is a less common cryptosystem. The key of curve cipher is actually the
number of columns of the table and the curve path. For example, if the plaintext is
"THISISATESTTEXT", fil the text into the matrix first (Fig. 7.10); then take out the
characters from the table according to the pre-agreed path. You can get the ciphertext
“ISTXETTSTHISETA" (Fig. 7.11).

7.2.4Classical CipherSummary
We have to admire the wisdom of the ancients for the various classical ciphers.
However, most CTFs rarely take the encryption and decryption of a classical code as
the core of a challenge. If you encounter a classical cipher that you have never seen
before, you can search on Google, or try some tools such as Ciphey (https:/github.
com/Ciphey/Ciphey) or CyberChef (htps://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/).
7.3Block Ciphers
In cryptography, Block Cipher, also known as Block Encryption, is a symmetric
cryptographic algorithm that divides a plaintext into multiple blocks of equal length
and encrypts or decrypts each block separately using a deterministic algorithm and a
symmetric key. Block cipher is an extremely important encryption scheme. For
example, DES and AES were approved by the U.S. govermment as standard encryp-
tion algorithms for a wide range of applications, from email encryption to bank
transaction transfers.
In essence, block ciphers can be understood as a special kind of substitution
cipher, except that it replaces one block at a time. Because the plaintext space is
large, it is not possible to produce a cipher table corresponding to the plaintext for
different keys, and only specific decryption algorithms can be used to restore the
plaintext.

7.3.1Common Modes ofOperations
In cryptography, the mode of operation of the block cipher allows encryption of
more than one block of data using the same packet cipher key. The block cipher itself
can only encrypt a single block of data whose length is equal to the length of the
cipher block. To encrypt longer data, the data must first be divided into several
separate chunks. Usually, the last block of data needs to be expanded to match the
block size using appropriate padding. The mode of operation describes the process
of encrypting each data block and is often randomized using an additional initiali-
zation vector (IV) to ensure security.
The study of modes of operations used to include data integrity protection, i.e.,
the error propagation characteristics of the cipher, if some byte is modified. Subse-
quent research has treated integrity protection as an entirely different cryptosystem-
independent goal of cryptography. Some modern modes of operations combine
encryption (confidentiality) and authentication in an efficient way, which is called
authentication encryption.
7.3.1.1ECB
ECB (Electronic Code Book) is the simplest mode of operation, where each block of
plaintext is independently encrypted into ciphertext (Fig. 7.12). If the length of the
plaintext is not a multiple of the block size, it needs to be padded by some specific
method. If the plaintext is P, the ciphertext is C, the encryption algorithm is E, and

the decryption algorithm is D, then the encryption and decryption process in the
ECB mode can be represented as follows.
C, = E(P)
P; = D(C)
The disadvantage of the ECB mode is that the same plaintext blocks are encrypted
into identical ciphertext blocks, so the data patterm is not well hidden. In some cases,
this method does not provide strict data confidentiality and is therefore not
recommended for cryptographic protocols.
7.3.1.2 CBC
In CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode, each plaintext block is encrypted after it has
been XORed with the preceding cipher block (Fig. 7.13). In this mode, each
ciphertext block depends on all the plaintext blocks before it; also, an initialization
vector needs to be used in the first block.
Suppose the index of the first block is 1, then the encryption and decryption of the
CBC can be expressed as follows:
C =IVC, = E(PC-1
C = IV·P, = D(C)  C1

7.3.1.3OFB
The OFB (Output FeedBack) mode tums the block cipher into a synchronized stream
cipher, encrypts the output of the previous encryption using the key again
(encrypting the IV for the first time), and the encryption result is used as a key
stream, which is then XORed with the plaintext block to obtain the ciphertext.
Because of the symmetry of the XOR operation, the encryption and decryption
operations are identical, as shown in Fig. 7.14. The OFB model can be represented
by the following formula:
O = IV
O; = E(O;1)
C;=P;0;
P;=C;0
7.3.1.4 CFB
CFB (Cipher FeedBack) is similar to OFB, except that it uses the ciphertext of the
previous block as the input of the current block, while OFB uses the output of
previous block cipher encryption instead of the final ciphertext (Fig. 7.15).
The encryption and decryption of the CFB can be expressed as.

7.3.1.5CTR
CTR mode (Counter Mode, CM) is also known as ICM mode (Integer Counter
Mode) and SIC mode (Segmented Integer Counter). Similar to OFB, CTR turms
block ciphers into stream ciphers by encrypting successive values of a counter to
produce a keystream. Indeed, the counter can be any function that is guaranteed not
to produce repeated output for a long time, but using a counter is the simplest and
most common practice. CTR mode has similar characteristics to OFB, but also
allows a random access property during decryption, which means the decryption
process can start from any block in the ciphertext instead of the first one.
The *Nonce” in Fig. 7.16 is the same as the IV (initialization vector) in the other
diagrams. The IV and counter should be concatenated so that the same plaintexts
produce different ciphertexts.

7.3.2Feistel Cipher and DES
7.3.2.1Feistel Cipher
block ciphers, is named aftr German physicist and cryptographer Horst Feistel,
In cryptography, the Feistel Cipher, used to construct the symmetric structure of
commonly referred to as the Feistel Network. He did this pioneering research while
working at IBM in the United States. A variety of well-known block ciphers use this
scheme, including DES, Twofish, XTEA, Blowfish, etc. The advantage of Feistel
ciphers is that the encryption and decryption operations are very similar, and in some
I°L ! rualuee Kay a jo esanan e Aquo sunba jeouap! uaaa sass
shows the encryption and decryption structure of the Feistel cipher.
Each block of plaintext is divided into two parts, Lo and Rg, where R, and key is
passed into the round function F and the result of the F function is XORed with the
other part of the plaintext L and forms R, while L is assigned as Rg, i.e., for each
round there are
L+1 = R
R+1 = L F(R, K,)
After n rounds of operations, you can get the ciphertext (R, + 1, I + 1).

After n rounds of operations, you can get the plaintext (La, R).
Note that the Feistel cipher only encrypts half of the bytes in each round of
encryption, and the round function F does not need to be reversible. Essentially, the
round function F can be treated as a random generator, and if there is no way to
predict the data generated in each round, then there is no way for an attacker to use
this as a breakthrough point to attack the cryptosystem.
7.3.2.2 DES
DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a typical cryptographic algorithm based on the
Feistel structure, which was established as a Federal Information Processing Stan-
dard (FIPS) by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in 1976 and has been widely
used internationally since then. DES is a symmetric-key algorithm using a 56 bits
key, which has a relatively short key and is suspected of containing backdoors from
the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), the DES algorithm was controversial
when first introduced, came under intense scrutiny, and drove the development of
modern block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.
