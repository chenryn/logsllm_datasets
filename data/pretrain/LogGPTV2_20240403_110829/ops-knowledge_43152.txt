User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Exchange Realtime Logs? (Like tail on Linux) Is there a way to monitor the exchange logs in realtime like using 'tail -f /var/log/mail.log' in linux?  The GUI tools for exchange under SBS 2008 suck for looking at what's going on in realtime.

Assistant: Exchange does not generate that kind of log. The closest it gets is deep in the message tree.

%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft\Exchange Server\TransportRoles\Logs\MessageTracking

As I said, that's not directly equivalent to /var/log/mail.log, but it is the store that Message Tracking sorts through.
