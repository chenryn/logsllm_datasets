It sounds like you're encountering a `BadValueError` when attempting to delete records from your datastore, due to the `Districts` column being required but null for all rows. This issue is preventing you from cleaning up the datastore, which you need to do in order to address a bulk loader error.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this:

1. **Modify the Entity/Model**:
   - Temporarily change the `Districts` property in your entity or model to be optional (i.e., not required). This will allow you to delete the records without encountering the `BadValueError`.
   - For example, if you are using Google Cloud Datastore with Python and the NDB library, you might modify the model definition as follows:
     ```python
     class MyEntity(ndb.Model):
         # Change from: Districts = ndb.StringProperty(required=True)
         Districts = ndb.StringProperty()
     ```

2. **Delete the Records**:
   - After making the `Districts` property optional, you can proceed to delete the records.
   - You can use a query to fetch and delete the entities:
     ```python
     keys = MyEntity.query().fetch(keys_only=True)
     ndb.delete_multi(keys)
     ```

3. **Revert the Model Change**:
   - Once the records have been deleted, you can revert the `Districts` property back to being required if that is necessary for your application.
   - For example:
     ```python
     class MyEntity(ndb.Model):
         Districts = ndb.StringProperty(required=True)
     ```

4. **Address the Bulk Loader Issue**:
   - With the datastore cleaned up, you can now focus on resolving the bulk loader error. Ensure that the data being loaded includes valid values for the `Districts` field to prevent similar issues in the future.

By following these steps, you should be able to clean out the datastore and fix the bulk loader error.
