User: I am trying to delete records in the datastore.  Unfortunately, whenever I try to delete the items, it gives me a BadValueError, saying Districts (one of the columns) is required.  Because of an issue with the bulk loader, Districts is null for all of the rows...but I still need to clean out the datastore to try to fix the bulk loader error.
What can I do?
Assistant: Change your entities/models so that Districts is no longer a required property?
