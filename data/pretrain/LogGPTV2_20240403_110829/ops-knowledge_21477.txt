User: I have a Python program (GUI application). I can run this program from the command prompt on Windows (command line on Linux). But it can be too complicated for users. Is there an easy way to initiate a start of the program with a click (double click) on a pictogram (a small image on the desktop)?
Assistant: Use py2exe to make an exe and just to make it more 'user friendly' use Inno set up (www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php ) along with IStools to build up an installer which would integrate the GUI with sound, widgets, other elements etc and users who do not have python etc installed in their systems can also play your GUI perfectly fine ! 
By the way what GUI are you using ? pygame, tk, wx, PyQt ...etc ?
