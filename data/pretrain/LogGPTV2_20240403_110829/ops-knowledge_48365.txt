User:  How to use Ansible to automate the management of Linux servers and implement platform-based deployment and configuration?
Assistant: 1. Install Ansible Ansible is an automation tool written in Python that can be used to easily manage distributed systems. Therefore, the first step is to install Ansible on the control node. Please install the version appropriate for your distribution. 2. Build the Ansible hosts file Ansible uses a hosts file as its inventory, which contains all the servers and groups to use. The hosts file should include as many servers as possible, along with variables and grouping information associated with each server. 3. Configure SSH key authentication When using Ansible, it is best to use SSH key authentication instead of passwords to connect to remote hosts. This can be achieved by using ssh-keygen (used on the control node), copying the public key to all machines. 4. Write Ansible Playbook Playbook is an essential part of Ansible automation process. Each Playbook is a manifest that contains definitions of one or more tasks to run. When writing a playbook, make sure to include all variables, groupings, and commands to perform the automation work. 5. Execute the Ansible Playbook The final step is to run the Ansible Playbook on the control node. Passing the Playbook file to Ansible can be done by running the following command: ansible-playbook playbook.yml 6. Platform-based deployment and configuration For platform-based deployment and configuration, Ansible Roles can be used. Role is a mechanism for classifying and processing servers. It can divide servers into different roles according to their functions, and provide different Ansible Playbooks according to roles. For example, a database server may require configuration of database software, while a web server may require configuration of web server software. By using Role, platform-based deployment and configuration can be easily implemented.
