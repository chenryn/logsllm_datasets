As noted in this Court’s previous order, the literal elements of the game client
software stored on the user’s hard drive may be accessed and copied without connecting to
a Blizzard game server and without successfully bypassing scan.dll or the resident
component of Warden.  For this reason, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of
MDY and Donnelly on the section 1201(a)(2) claim related to the game client literal software
code.  Dkt. #82.  The Court concluded that Warden did not prevent users from gaining access
to the literal code and therefore was not a technological measure covered by section
1201(a)(2).  Id. at 19.
The literal code, however, constitutes only a small part of the game client software.
The majority of the software consists of nonliteral elements – the digital multi-media content
such as environmental graphics (mountains, lakes, oceans, trees, castles, rain, fog, meteor
storms, etc.), sound effects (monsters roaring, rain falling, birds singing, battle cries, and
explosions, etc.), music played in different geographical areas of the game, and a large
variety of player avatars, each of which can wear a wide array of clothing and armor and
carry a wide variety of weapons and equipment.  These nonliteral elements are stored in the
user’s hard drive and loaded into RAM after scan.dll has functioned and the user has
connected to Blizzard’s game server.  These elements continue to be loaded into RAM as a
user plays the game and encounters new areas and characters of the game. 
The nonliteral aspects of the game client software include more than 400,000 discrete
visual and aural components.  Although it is the combination of these components as
prompted by the Blizzard server that creates the dynamic WoW environment, individual
nonliteral components may be accessed by a user without signing on to the server.  As was
demonstrated during trial, an owner of the game client software may use independently
purchased computer programs to call up the visual images or the recorded sounds within the
game client software.  For example, a user may call up and listen to the roar a particular
monster makes within the game.  Or the user may call up a visual image of that monster.  The
image does not appear in the dynamic WoW game environment, but instead appears on the
user’s screen with a blank background.  The user may cause the image to run, fight, or die

by accessing additional components of the game client software, but the image performs
these activities in a void, not in the dynamic world created by the WoW game.  Similarly, a
user may call up an avatar and select the clothing, armor, weapons, and other equipment with
which the avatar is clothed and equipped.  Or an owner may call up a particular geographical
area of the game and see the hills, trees, and structures in that area. 
Although an owner of the game client software may thus view and listen to the
discrete nonliteral components of the game stored on his hard drive, the user cannot create
or experience the dynamic, changing world of the game without signing on to a Blizzard
server.  The user could call up discrete elements to create a landscape and place a discrete
character of a monster within it, and thus achieve a single visible scene on his computer
screen, but the scene would not be dynamic – the user could not fight the monster, travel
through the countryside, and encounter other players or scenes as he can while playing
WoW.  Thus, although the individual nonliteral illustrations and sounds created by the game
client software may be viewed in isolation, or even in limited combinations, they cannot be
viewed in the dynamic context of the WoW game, or controlled or choreographed by a
Blizzard server, unless the user logs on and stays connected to a Blizzard server.  To do so,
of course, requires the user to bypass scan.dll and the resident component of Warden.
Warden therefore controls access to the dynamic nonliteral elements of the WoW game
environment.
Some of the dynamic game content is provided or controlled by the Blizzard server.
For example, the server decides how large or small to make an image or how soft or loud to
make a noise.  The server choreographs the dynamic scene being viewed on the user’s
computer screen, and provides the prompts necessary for the nonliteral elements on the user’s
hard drive to be loaded into RAM and displayed on the screen in the appropriate locations
and sequences.  The server determines where each monster will spawn, what type of monster
will appear, the monster’s capabilities, and what treasure will be recovered if the monster is
defeated.  The server determines the amount of damage inflicted by a blow from a monster
or another player, and when a character dies.  The server provides the quest scripts read by

users on their screens to understand the quests they are undertaking.  None of these server-
provided features may be accessed by the user without clearing the scan.dll investigation
when logging on and repeatedly passing the resident component as the game is played.
MDY and Donnelly have designed Glider to avoid detection by Warden.  Glider
software examines a user’s computer configuration and makes recommendations on what can
be done to minimize the risk of detection.  Glider takes other specific steps to disguise its
presence.  Blizzard has succeeded on three occasions in developing software that detected
Glider.  Each time, Blizzard collected the identities of Glider users and banned them from
continuing to play WoW.  Each time, MDY and Donnelly modified Glider to again avoid
detection by Warden.  At present, Warden cannot detect the presence of Glider in WoW.
MDY and Donnelly have also taken steps to make it more difficult for WoW players to
recognize when another player is using Glider.  
Glider’s anti-detection features are essential to Glider’s commercial success.
Donnelly reverse-engineered Warden to learn how to make Glider undetectable.
B.
Section 1201(a)(2) Claim.
Blizzard alleges that MDY and Donnelly violate section 1201(a)(2) by enabling
Glider to evade Warden.  As noted above, the Court has rejected this claim with respect to
the literal code contained in the game client software.  Blizzard also contends, however, that
Glider violates section 1201(a)(2) because Warden controls access to the nonliteral elements
of WoW and Glider defeats that control.  This claim clearly fails with respect to the discrete
nonliteral sights and sounds associated with each of the more than 400,000 individual
components of the game client software.  As explained above, these components can be
accessed on the user’s hard drive without connecting to Blizzard’s servers and, therefore,
without circumventing Warden.  Because Warden does not control access to these individual
nonliteral aspects of the game, section 1201(a)(2) does not apply.
The same cannot be said, however, with respect to the dynamic nonliteral elements
of the WoW game.  These dynamic components – the real-time experience of traveling
through different worlds, hearing their sounds, viewing their structures, encountering their

inhabitants and monsters, and encountering other players – cannot be accessed on a user’s
hard drive.  They can be accessed only when the user is connected to a Blizzard server,
something that requires the user successfully to pass by scan.dll when he logs on and to
survive the periodic scrutiny of the resident component.  Warden does control access to the
dynamic nonliteral elements of the game and, in this respect, falls within section 1201(a)(2).
MDY and Donnelly argue that section 1201(a)(2) does not apply because the dynamic
nonliteral elements of the WoW game cannot be copyrighted, and Warden therefore does not
control access to a “work protected by this title” as required by the section.  See 17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(2)(A), (B), (C).  This argument appears to be based on the Copyright Act’s
statement that “[c]opyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original works
of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed,
from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly
or with the aid of a machine or device.”  17 U.S.C. § 1012(a) (emphasis added).  MDY and
Donnelly also argue that the dynamic elements of the game cannot be copyrighted because
they are controlled by users of the game, not Blizzard.  Courts have rejected both arguments.
Audio-visual displays of computer games are subject to copyright protection, and a player’s
interaction with the software of those games does not defeat this protection even though the
player’s actions in part determine what is displayed on the computer screen.  See Atari
Games Corp.  v. Oman, 888 F.2d 878, 884-85 (D.C. Cir. 1989); Midway Mfg. Co. v. Arctic
Int’l, Inc., 704 F.2d 1009, 1011-12 (7th Cir. 1983); Williams Elec., Inc. v. Arctic Int’l, Inc.,
685 F.2d 870, 874 (3d Cir. 1982); Stern Elecs., Inc. v. Kaufman, 669 F.2d 852, 855-56 (2d
Cir. 1982). 
MDY and Donnelly also contend that Warden does not satisfy the definition of
section 1201(a)(2).  The statute applies to a “technological measure” that “effectively
controls access to a work[.]”  17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(3)(B).  The statute explains that a measure
meets this definition “if the measure, in the ordinary course of is operation, requires the
application of information, or a process or a treatment, with the authority of the copyright
owner, to gain access to the work.”  Id.  The resident component of Warden satisfies this

requirement.  As explained above, the resident component calls for the game client software
to examine portions of the user’s computer memory and report the results back to Blizzard’s
server.  If the report reflects software associated with Glider or other bots, Warden can block
the user’s access to the server.  Thus, as a user plays WoW, the resident component requires
the user’s computer to apply information (the results of the memory scan) to gain continuing
access to the server and the WoW game.  MDY and Donnelly argued at trial that the
language of section 1201(a)(3)(B) should be read to require that the computer user – not the
computer – apply the required information, but they cite no authority for this narrow reading
and courts have held that computer-applied information satisfies the definition of section
1201(a)(3)(B).  See, e.g., 321 Studios v. MGM Studios, 307 F. Supp. 2d 1085, 1095 (N.D.
Cal. 2004) (CSS technology, which required a DVD player to apply certain keys and
algorithms to gain access to movies and movie-related content, constituted a technological
measure within section 1201(a)(2)).
The Court concludes that MDY has violated section 1201(a)(2) with respect to the
dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW.  Warden constitutes a technological measure that
effectively controls access to such elements, and such elements are protected by copyright
law.  Glider circumvents Warden by avoiding and bypassing its detection features.  See
17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(3)(A) (“to ‘circumvent a technological measure’ means . . . to avoid,
bypass, remove, deactivate, or impair [the] measure, without the authority of the copyright
owner”).  MDY knowingly markets Glider “for use in circumventing” Warden.  17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(a)(2)(C).  All aspects of the statute are thus satisfied.
Some courts have adopted a six-part test for a violation of section 1201(a)(2):
A plaintiff alleging a violation of § 1201(a)(2) must prove: (1)
ownership of a valid copyright on a work, (2) effectively controlled by a
technological measure, which has been circumvented, (3) that third parties can
now access (4) without authorization, in a manner that (5) infringes or
facilitates infringing a right protected by the Copyright Act, because of a
product that (6) the defendant either (i) designed or produced primarily for
circumvention; (ii) made available despite only limited commercial
significance other than circumvention; or (iii) marketed for use in
circumvention of the controlling technological measure.

2 MDY and Donnelly conceded during trial that these aspects of WoW could be
recorded while a user is playing WoW.  This could be done with software that records the
sights and sounds of the game as it is being played.  Indeed, a few of such copies were played
by Blizzard during trial.  Because such copying would constitute copying within the meaning
of section 106 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106(1)-(3), Warden prevents users from
exercising a right (copying) belonging to Blizzard as the copyright owner.  MDY and
Donnelly argued that Glider does not create such a copy.  That may be true, but Warden
clearly constitutes a technological measure that prevents such copying, and Glider, by
circumventing that technological measure, facilitates such copying.  Nothing more is required
for a violation of section 1201(a)(2).

(emphasis in original).
Blizzard’s claim satisfies this test.  First, Blizzard has a valid copyright in the dynamic
nonliteral elements of WoW.  Second, access to those elements is effectively controlled by
Warden, a measure Glider circumvents.  Third, Glider enables third parties to access the
dynamic nonliteral elements of the game.  Fourth, Blizzard has not authorized this access.
Fifth, once players obtain access to these elements of the game, they may copy those
elements as they are displayed.2  Sixth, MDY has designed and produced Glider primarily
to circumvent Warden, Glider is made available despite the fact that it only has commercial
significance as a bot that can circumvent Warden, and MDY markets Glider for use in
circumventing Warden and playing WoW.  
C.
Blizzard’s Section 1201(b)(1) Claim.
Section 1201(b)(1) applies to a technological measure “that effectively protects a right
of a copyright owner under this title in a work or a portion thereof[.]”  17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(b)(1)(A).  A “technological measure ‘effectively protects a right of a copyright owner
under this title’ if the measure, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or
otherwise limits the exercise of a right of a copyright owner under this title.”  17 U.S.C.
§ 1201(b)(2)(B).  Warden satisfies this requirement with respect to the dynamic nonliteral
elements of WoW.  
MDY and Donnelly argue that the only “right of a copyright owner” at issue in this
