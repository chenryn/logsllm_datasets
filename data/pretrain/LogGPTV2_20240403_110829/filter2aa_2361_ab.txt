### Summary of the Court's Previous Order

In a prior order, this Court noted that the literal elements of the game client software, stored on the user's hard drive, can be accessed and copied without connecting to a Blizzard game server and without bypassing `scan.dll` or the resident component of Warden. Consequently, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of MDY and Donnelly on the Section 1201(a)(2) claim related to the game client's literal software code (Dkt. #82). The Court concluded that Warden did not prevent users from accessing the literal code, and thus, it was not a technological measure covered by Section 1201(a)(2).

### Nonliteral Elements of the Game Client Software

The literal code, however, constitutes only a small part of the game client software. The majority of the software consists of nonliteral elements, such as digital multimedia content, including environmental graphics (e.g., mountains, lakes, oceans, trees, castles, rain, fog, meteor storms), sound effects (e.g., monster roars, rain, bird songs, battle cries, explosions), music specific to different geographical areas, and a wide variety of player avatars, each with diverse clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. These nonliteral elements are stored on the user's hard drive and loaded into RAM after `scan.dll` has functioned and the user has connected to Blizzard’s game server. As the user plays the game and encounters new areas and characters, these elements continue to be loaded into RAM.

The nonliteral aspects of the game client software include over 400,000 discrete visual and aural components. While the combination of these components, as prompted by the Blizzard server, creates the dynamic World of Warcraft (WoW) environment, individual nonliteral components can be accessed by a user without signing on to the server. For example, a user can use independently purchased computer programs to call up and listen to a monster's roar or view a monster's image on a blank background. The user can also manipulate the image to run, fight, or die, but these actions occur in a void, not in the dynamic WoW game world. Similarly, a user can call up an avatar and select its clothing, armor, weapons, and other equipment, or view a particular geographical area with its hills, trees, and structures.

### Dynamic Nonliteral Elements and Server Control

Although a user can view and listen to the discrete nonliteral components stored on their hard drive, they cannot create or experience the dynamic, changing world of the game without signing on to a Blizzard server. The user could create a single visible scene by combining discrete elements, but the scene would not be dynamic; the user could not engage in combat, travel through the landscape, or interact with other players as they can while playing WoW. To experience the dynamic context of the WoW game, the user must log on and stay connected to a Blizzard server, which requires bypassing `scan.dll` and the resident component of Warden. Therefore, Warden controls access to the dynamic nonliteral elements of the WoW game environment.

Some dynamic game content is provided or controlled by the Blizzard server. The server determines the size and volume of images and sounds, choreographs the dynamic scenes, and provides prompts for nonliteral elements to be loaded into RAM and displayed on the screen. The server also decides where monsters spawn, their capabilities, and the rewards for defeating them. It manages the damage inflicted by monsters or other players, character deaths, and quest scripts. None of these features can be accessed without clearing the `scan.dll` investigation when logging on and repeatedly passing the resident component during gameplay.

### Glider and Warden Evasion

MDY and Donnelly designed Glider to avoid detection by Warden. Glider examines a user’s computer configuration and makes recommendations to minimize the risk of detection. It also takes steps to disguise its presence. Blizzard has successfully developed software to detect Glider three times, each time banning Glider users. Each time, MDY and Donnelly modified Glider to evade Warden. Currently, Warden cannot detect Glider in WoW. MDY and Donnelly have also taken steps to make it more difficult for WoW players to recognize when another player is using Glider. Glider’s anti-detection features are essential to its commercial success, and Donnelly reverse-engineered Warden to learn how to make Glider undetectable.

### Section 1201(a)(2) Claim

Blizzard alleges that MDY and Donnelly violate Section 1201(a)(2) by enabling Glider to evade Warden. The Court has already rejected this claim concerning the literal code in the game client software. Blizzard further contends that Glider violates Section 1201(a)(2) because Warden controls access to the nonliteral elements of WoW, and Glider defeats that control. This claim fails with respect to the discrete nonliteral sights and sounds, as these can be accessed on the user’s hard drive without connecting to Blizzard’s servers and without circumventing Warden. However, the claim holds for the dynamic nonliteral elements of the WoW game, which can only be accessed when the user is connected to a Blizzard server, requiring successful bypassing of `scan.dll` and the resident component of Warden.

MDY and Donnelly argue that Section 1201(a)(2) does not apply because the dynamic nonliteral elements of the WoW game cannot be copyrighted, and Warden does not control access to a “work protected by this title” as required by the section. Courts have rejected this argument, holding that audio-visual displays of computer games are subject to copyright protection, and a player’s interaction with the software does not defeat this protection.

MDY and Donnelly also contend that Warden does not satisfy the definition of a technological measure under Section 1201(a)(3)(B). The statute applies to a measure that “effectively controls access to a work.” The resident component of Warden meets this requirement by examining portions of the user’s computer memory and reporting the results back to Blizzard’s server. If the report reflects software associated with Glider or other bots, Warden can block the user’s access to the server. Thus, the resident component requires the user’s computer to apply information to gain continuing access to the server and the WoW game. Courts have held that computer-applied information satisfies the definition of Section 1201(a)(3)(B).

### Conclusion on Section 1201(a)(2) Violation

The Court concludes that MDY has violated Section 1201(a)(2) with respect to the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW. Warden is a technological measure that effectively controls access to these elements, which are protected by copyright law. Glider circumvents Warden by avoiding and bypassing its detection features. MDY knowingly markets Glider “for use in circumventing” Warden, satisfying all aspects of the statute.

### Chamberlain Group Test

Some courts have adopted a six-part test for a violation of Section 1201(a)(2):

1. Ownership of a valid copyright on a work.
2. The work is effectively controlled by a technological measure, which has been circumvented.
3. Third parties can now access the work.
4. Access is without authorization.
5. Access infringes or facilitates infringing a right protected by the Copyright Act.
6. The defendant either (i) designed or produced the product primarily for circumvention; (ii) made the product available despite limited commercial significance other than circumvention; or (iii) marketed the product for use in circumvention of the controlling technological measure.

Blizzard’s claim satisfies this test. First, Blizzard has a valid copyright in the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW. Second, access to these elements is effectively controlled by Warden, which Glider circumvents. Third, Glider enables third parties to access the dynamic nonliteral elements of the game. Fourth, Blizzard has not authorized this access. Fifth, once players obtain access, they may copy these elements as they are displayed. Sixth, MDY has designed and produced Glider primarily to circumvent Warden, and Glider is marketed for use in circumventing Warden and playing WoW.

### Section 1201(b)(1) Claim

Section 1201(b)(1) applies to a technological measure that effectively protects a right of a copyright owner under the Copyright Act. A technological measure “effectively protects a right of a copyright owner” if it, in the ordinary course of its operation, prevents, restricts, or otherwise limits the exercise of a right of a copyright owner. Warden satisfies this requirement with respect to the dynamic nonliteral elements of WoW.

MDY and Donnelly argue that the only “right of a copyright owner” at issue is the right to prevent copying, and that Warden does not prevent copying. However, Warden clearly constitutes a technological measure that prevents unauthorized copying, and Glider, by circumventing Warden, facilitates such copying.
