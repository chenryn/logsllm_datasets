User: In the Linux system, how to change the permissions of users and groups?
Assistant: To change user and group permissions, use the following commands: 1. Change user permissions: Use the chmod command to change user permissions. The syntax of this command is as follows: chmod [permission setting] file or directory name where [permission setting] can be a numerical permission value or a symbolic permission symbol. For example: chmod 755 file.txt or chmod u+rwx,go+rx file.txt The above command sets the permission of the file file.txt to 755, that is, the owner can read, write, and execute, and other users can only read and execute. 2. Change the group to which the user belongs: Use the chown command to change the owner and group of a file or directory. The syntax of this command is as follows: chown [new owner name] [file or directory name] chgrp [new group name] [file or directory name] For example: chown user1 file.txt or chgrp group1 file.txt The above command will file file. The owner of txt is set to user1, or the group it belongs to is set to group1. Note: Changing the owner and group of a file or directory requires root privileges.
