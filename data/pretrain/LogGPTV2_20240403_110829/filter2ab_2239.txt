**Title: Botconf 2016 - LURK: The Story of Five Years of Activity**

LURK, a cybercriminal group, has been active exclusively in Russia since late 2011. However, their activities gained international attention when the technologies they employed became more widely recognized in the global market several years later. Despite the low detection rates by antivirus vendors, we managed to track their activities over this period.

In this presentation, we will provide an in-depth analysis of LURK's operations over five years, detailing their methods and tactics. We will also highlight the many high-profile victims, including what we term "intermediate victims," whose websites were used for malware distribution. Notable among these are major news agencies with up to one million unique visitors per day, as well as government domains.

Our efforts have included coordination with the affected entities and various Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). We will share both successful and unsuccessful strategies for mitigating attacks by this group. Additionally, we will discuss the impact of the arrest of LURK members in June on the broader landscape of exploit kit activities.
