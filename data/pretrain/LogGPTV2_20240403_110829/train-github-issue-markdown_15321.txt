While trying to play a large sized gif (11mb) on Android 6 it plays very
slowly, even if the gif is inside the app and not fetched from the network.  
Smaller gifs play well, so I assume this is related to memory limit, is there
anything that can be done to work around this?
I already tried the override down to 50x50, still plays extremely slow.
