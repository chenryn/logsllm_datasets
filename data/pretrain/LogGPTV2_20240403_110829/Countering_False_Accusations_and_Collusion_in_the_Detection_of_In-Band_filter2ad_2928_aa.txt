1.  Introduction 
Detecting certain kinds of attacks on mobile ad hoc 
networks (MANETS), especially misbehavior in regard 
to  routing  protocols  and  packet  forwarding,  requires

computing  hosts  as  network 
intrusion  sensors.  
Because ordinary hosts run complex applications, they 
are  far  more  vulnerable  to  cyber  penetration  and 
compromise  than  the  dedicated  network  intrusion 
detection  systems  typically  used  to  monitor  wired 
networks.  If a host is compromised, it can inject bogus 
  Such 
data  into  the  cooperative  intrusion  detection  system.  
This data  can be used  to  conceal  malicious  activities, 
i.e.,  evade  detection.    Of  greater  concern  is  the 
potential  injection  of  false  accusations.  These  could 
stimulate  an  intrusion  response  system  to  curtail  the 
access  of  falsely-accused  victims,  leading  to  a  self-
inflicted denial of service. 
intrusion  detection 
This form of the Byzantine fault tolerance problem 
is  a  critical,  fundamental  issue  for  any  cooperative 
intrusion detection system.  Well-known approaches to 
Byzantine fault tolerance typically involve some form 
of  voting 
in  which  correctly  executing  replica 
processes  are  able  to  outvote  a  smaller  number  of 
dishonest  (faulty)  processes,  often  less  than  one  third 
of the total population [15].  Applying such approaches 
to  cooperative 
in  MANETs 
confronts  several  obstacles.    Because  traffic  in  a 
MANET  is  dispersed  throughout  the  network,  each 
node  has  a  unique  view  of  network  activity,  so 
distributed 
replicas. 
in  particular 
Furthermore,  only  nodes 
topological  locations  can  observe  the  attack  traffic  or 
network  symptoms  in  question  and  reliably  attest  to 
whether or not an attack occurred.  In other words, the 
set  of  nodes  that  is  eligible  to  vote  depends  on  the 
topology of the network and the routes used or affected 
by  the  attack.    Moreover,  the  topology  of  a  MANET 
may change continually; hence the set of nodes that is 
eligible to vote about a particular attack may vary over 
time.

We  examine  these  issues  in  the  context  of  an  in-
band  wormhole  attack  on  the  OLSR  routing  protocol 
[14].  In this attack, a collection of colluding attackers 
creates  the  illusion  that  a  single-hop  “short  cut”,  (a 
layer 2 link) exists between two nodes in distant parts 
of  the  network.    The  attackers  create  this  illusion  by 
connecting the purported neighbors by a much longer, 
covert  tunnel  through  other  unsuspecting  nodes.    If

amount  of  traffic,  diverting  it  from  optimal  routes  so 
that it flows instead through the attacking nodes.  This 
enables  the  attacker  to  delay,  discard,  or  corrupt  the 
attracted  traffic  at  an  opportune  time. 
  Another

along  a  highly  suboptimal  path.    As  a  result,  in-band

congestion, packet loss, and delay.  In contrast, out-of-

attention,  connect  purported  neighbors  via  a  wireline 
network  or  additional  RF  channel  that  actually  adds 
capacity to the network.  For this reason, out-of band 
wormholes  are  arguably  less  harmful  than  in-band

Building  on  our  prior  research  [14],  we  describe  a

concluding  that  an  attack  is  underway,  the  detector

corroborated  by  colluding  attackers,  as  long  as  a 
sufficient  number  of  honest  nodes  are  appropriately 
positioned topologically.  We refer to this approach as 
opportunistic  voting  because  it  utilizes  as  voters 
whichever nodes are in the right place at the right time. 
The  use  of  voting 
to  make  end-to-end  path 
measurements  resilient  to  injection  of  bogus  data 
appears to be unique to our detector.  Nevertheless this 
notion may have broader potential value for increasing 
the Byzantine resistance of network path measurement 
techniques used in other intrusion detection approaches 
[10][12], as well as network fault localization [20] and 
network tomography [8].

Our paper makes the following contributions: 
•  We  present  an  opportunistic  voting  algorithm 
for detecting and localizing in-band wormholes 
in  which  votes  are  based  on  roundtrip  delay 
measurements reported by independent pairs of 
nodes.    Voting  is  used  for  false  accusation 
resistance. 
•  We  describe  a  form  of  wormhole  attack  that 
includes  coordinated 
false  accusations  by 
colluding pairs of nodes and actions by them to 
trick benign nodes into accusing other nodes.   
•  We  present  specialized 
results 
showing the algorithm’s effectiveness against a 
tests  and 
real implementation of this attack running in a 
network  emulation  testbed.    The  results  show 
that  opportunistic  voting  provides  substantial 
instantaneously  suppressing  false 
value  by 
accusations 
in  dynamic 
topologies  and  at 
varying network densities.  
•  We discuss the effects of topology and routing 
on  the  eligibility  of  nodes  to  vote  on  the 
innocence of an accused link. 
This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.    Section  2 
discusses related work.  Section 3 provides background 
on the in-band wormhole attack.  Section 4 presents the 
wormhole detection and Byzantine resilience strategies 
we  propose  and  the  prototype  detector  we  have 
constructed.    Sections  5  and  6  describe  prototype 
testing  and  test  results;  these  are  discussed  further  in 
Section  7.    Section  8,  the  conclusion,  provides  a 
summary and identifies future directions. 
2.  Related work 
A  number  of  other  researchers  have  developed 
intrusion detection techniques for wormhole attacks on 
MANETs.  Their techniques generally differ from ours 
in two ways: they do not address false accusations, and 
they  are  concerned  with  out-of-band  rather  than  in-
band wormholes. 
The concept of an out-of-band wormhole in ad hoc 
networks  was  introduced  by  Hu  [9],  who  outlines 
temporal and geographic countermeasures designed to 
detect the remote forwarding of packets. Hu describes 
packet leashes, which attempt to restrict the maximum 
transmission  distance  of  a  packet.    In  this  scheme, 
wormhole paths will cause neighbor-sensing and other 
packets  to  be  received  outside  a  tightly  synchronized 
time window, so that the packets are treated as invalid.  
Lazos  describes  a  different  geographic-based 
distance bounding  approach  for  defeating out-of-band 
wormhole  attacks  [16].  With  this  approach,  essential 
nodes are aware of their geographic location relative to 
specialized  guard  nodes.  Messages  forwarded  beyond 
their  local  reach  as  determined  by  the  guards,  or 
detected as duplicates, are considered to be indicative 
of  a  wormhole.  This  approach  may  not  provide 
adequate protection if the attackers are trusted insiders 
with  access  to  the  same  node  resources  as  other 
network  nodes.  Also,  a  highly  mobile  network  may 
violate  some  of  the  assumptions  made  about  node 
placement and density.   
Adjih  describes  several  approaches  for  countering 
out-of-band wormhole attacks on OLSR networks [3].

bounding  approach  for  containing  the  relaying  of

guard similar to [16] and [13] that attempts to monitor 
the  number  of  packets  sent  and  received  by  a  given 
node.  
Buttyán  proposes  techniques  for  detecting  out-of-
band  wormholes  based  on  statistical  changes  to 
neighbor  hop  counts  and  path  lengths  [7].  Local 
information is collected and reviewed by a central base 
station that detects changes in network behavior. These 
techniques are designed for static networks and do not 
identify the attackers.  
Khalil  describes  MANET  wormhole  defensive 
countermeasures  for  routing  protocols  like  DSR  and 
AODV  [13].    These  are  based  on  specialized  guard 
nodes that promiscuously monitor all forwarding paths, 
an  approach  resembling  the  distance-bound  approach 
proposed by [16].

its ability  to defend against various attacks, including 
out-of-band  wormholes  [2].    Awerbuch’s  “Byzantine 
wormhole”  is  the  out-of-band  equivalent  of  our  self-
contained  in-band  wormhole.  ODBSR  is  evaluated 
using  simulations  including  a  rectangular  mesh  of 
interconnected

“superwormhole”.  ODBSR mechanisms do not detect 
wormholes per se; they detect packet dropping that is 
applied  to  traffic  traveling  through  wormholes.    If  a 
wormhole is simply attracting traffic while waiting for 
an opportune time to disrupt it, or is already subjecting

discuss wormholes, two of his techniques are related to 
ours.  The  first  monitors  hop-by-hop  transit  times  for 
flows to identify nodes responsible for unusual delays.

to  be  stealthy 
Intrusion  detection  techniques  for  other  kinds  of 
attacks on MANETS have given more attention to false 
accusations  than  those  for  wormholes.  For  example, 
Buchegger proposes a reputation system for MANETs 
in  which  nodes  collect  first-hand  information  about 
other  nodes  by  direct  observation  and  share  it  with 
selected  other  nodes,  e.g.,  their  neighbors  [5].    Each 
node  maintains  a  rating  (a  continuous  variable)  for 
every  other  node  that  it  cares  about.    The  system  is 
designed  to  address  two  kinds  of  misbehavior:  a) 
routing  or  forwarding  misbehavior,  and  b)  lies  about 
the  reputation  of  other  nodes.    Using  second-hand 
information  about  both  good  and  bad  behavior  of 
others is said to accelerate the detection and isolation 
of  malicious  nodes,  but  can  endanger  the  integrity  of 
the  reputation  system  because  nodes  can  use  it  to 
disseminate  misinformation.    This  system  improves 
upon  Buchegger’s  earlier  reputation  system  called 
CONFIDANT  [4]  which  was  susceptible  to  false 
accusations.    To  counter  this  problem,  each  node 
accepts  second-hand  information  only  if  it  is  not  too 
dissimilar from that node’s first-hand information. 
continued 
In  Buchegger’s  and  most  other  reputation  systems 
[4][5][25],  each  node  can  maintain  its  own  rating  of 
other nodes because it bases that rating on observations 
it can make independently.  For example, if one node 
forwards  a  packet  to  another  node,  it  may  be  able  to
