Assistant: Whether there is an exception: no exception Description: The log information is a normal application log. It can be seen from the log information that when the application counts the number of standing steps, walking steps, and calorie value of the day, it calls the "Step_StandReportReceiver" function and outputs the calculation results in the form of strings. The calculation result is the number of standing steps, the number of walking steps, and the corresponding calorie value in the current day. Therefore, the log information does not contain any abnormal information.
