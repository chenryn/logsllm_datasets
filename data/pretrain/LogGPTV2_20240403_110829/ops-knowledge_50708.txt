User: How to use Python code to achieve multi-threaded functionality?
Assistant: To use Python to implement multithreading, you can use Python's built-in `threading` module. The following are the basic steps to create and start a new thread: 1. Import the `threading` module 2. Define a function as the entry point of the new thread 3. Add the code that needs to be executed in the new thread to the entry point function 4. Create A new `Thread` object, passing in the entry point function as a parameter 5. Call the `start()` method to start a new thread Sample code: ``` import threading # Define the entry point function def my_function(arg1, arg2): # in The code executed in the new thread pass # Create and start a new thread my_thread = threading.Thread(target=my_function, args=(arg1_val, arg2_val)) my_thread.start() ``` where `arg1` and `arg2` are passed to The parameters of the function `my_function`, `arg1_val` and `arg2_val` are the actual parameter values. After the `start()` method call, the new thread will execute the code in the `my_function` function. If you need to wait for the new thread to finish executing, you can use the `join()` method.
