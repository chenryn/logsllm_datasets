## Examples runs in debug mode but crash in release mode
    I'm using Visual studio 12 (2013) on a windows 7, 64 bit machine
    downloaded the opencv 3.0 beta relase
    and I try to run the cpp/letter_recog example.
    If I set visual studio to debug mode, and link it against opencv_world300d.lib the example crashes
    However in Release mode, when linking against opencv_world300.lib the example works fine
