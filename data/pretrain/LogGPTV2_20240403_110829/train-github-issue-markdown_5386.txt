At the moment there's no way that I can see to pass attr attributes through to
the separate date and time child widgets of a datetime instance. This is easy
to fix and I'm happy to put together a PR if people think it's a good idea.
The proposed solution is:
  * add `date_widget_attr` and `time_widget_attr` options to DateTimeType, which default to `array()`
  * in DateTimeType::buildForm(), pass these values through to the child widgets, using calls like `$dateOptions['attr'] = $options['date_widget_attr'];`
  * add related tests and documentation
As far as I can see, that's all that's needed (and is working in my local
code).
Let me know if this is considered useful and I'll put together a PR.
