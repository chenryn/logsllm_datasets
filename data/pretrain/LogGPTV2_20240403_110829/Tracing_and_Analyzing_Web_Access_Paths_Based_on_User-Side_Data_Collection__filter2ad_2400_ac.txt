accesses that reach malicious URLs remains very small; thus
the risk level is small. Therefore, the risk level of domains
cannot be evaluated by the number of accesses that reach
malicious URLs.
To identify untrustworthy bookmark domains, we deﬁne
the risk level of a domain that shows the certainty of reaching
malicious URLs as follows:
R(domain) =
NbrAccessmalurl(domain)
NbrAccessall(domain)
(1)
where R(domain) represents the risk level of a domain,
NbrAccessmalurl(domain) is the number of accesses to
the domain that eventually reach malicious URLs, and
NbrAccessall(domain) is the number of all accesses to
the domain. Note that these parameters ignore whether a
malicious URL is in the next hop or in multiple hops away.
With this risk level, we evaluate the risk level of bookmark
domains.

reach malicious URLs between February 2019 and January
2020 in descending order of the risk level. As can be seen,
legitimate sites that appeared in Table 4 do not appear in
the table. The top 10 bookmark domains accessed between
February 2019 and January 2020 are listed in Table 6. As
can be seen, the risk levels of the domains in Table 5 are
signiﬁcantly higher than the risk levels in Table 6.
Based on these analyses, we could review bookmarks to
minimize the risk of users. As discussed in Section 4.1,
bookmark access is a major entry point to hazardous paths.
Therefore, we can expect to minimize the number of accesses
to malicious URLs by sanitizing bookmarks. It can be difﬁcult
to prevent users from adding hazardous URLs to bookmarks
or to block access to hazardous bookmarked URLs. However,
simply showing alerts when accessing hazardous bookmarks
may help to improve the situation. Regularly reviewing the
list of bookmarks and providing alerts will be effective.
4.3 Time to reach malicious URLs
Figure 4 shows the cumulative histogram of the time to reach
a malicious URL from users’ ﬁrst access of the paths. Among
all the hazardous paths between February 2019 and January
Figure 4: Normalized cumulative histograms of the time to
reach a malicious URL in February 2019–January 2020 (left:
complete histogram, right: ﬁrst hour excerpt of the histogram)
2020, 87.03% reached a malicious URL within 24 hours from
their initial accesses, 80.03% within 6 hours, 68.75% within
an hour, and 60.31% within half an hour. We conjecture that
many accesses to malicious URLs occur within an hour, or
even within half an hour, because victims already have the
URLs that are close to malicious URLs in their bookmarks,
or they already know hazardous keywords that may lead to
malicious URLs when initiating a web search, as seen in
Section 4.1.
4.4 Number of active browser tabs
This section analyzes the number of active browser tabs. A
browser tab is considered active if some activities of a user is
observed on the browser tab. We assume that the number of
active browser tabs does not change before or after accessing
ordinary URLs. However, it is observed that many malicious
sites and some other sites open browser tabs unnecessarily.
To conﬁrm that, we analyzed the number of active browser
tabs before and after malicious URL accesses.
Figure 5 shows a histogram of the number of active browser
tabs within 10 minutes before and after malicious URL access.
Over 99% of victims use 1–2 browser tabs before and after
visiting malicious URLs. The ﬁgure also shows the number
of active browser tabs within 10 minutes before a malicious
access. Over 91% of victims use 1–4 browser tabs within 10
minutes before accessing malicious URLs4.
The difference in the number of active browser tabs
between the above two histograms indicates that there could
be browser tabs generated to reach malicious URLs, e.g.,
redirection pages opened in a new browser tab. This difference
cannot be used as a feature for detecting malicious URL
access because it requires access records after the malicious
URL access, but it could be analyzed further to devise a
4Note that the maximum number of active browser tabs was 39; however,
the frequency was negligible. Thus active browser tabs greater than 18 are
not present in the histogram.

as hazardous domains. Accesses through domain E reach
both blacklisted and non-blacklisted URLs; however this
domain is regarded as hazardous because the probability is
greater than the threshold value. Other domains are regarded
as non-hazardous because the probability is less than the
threshold value. These hazardous domains are not included
in the blacklist; however, we could block access to these
hazardous domains or alert users to minimize the risk of users’
accessing malicious URLs.
To realize this preemptive domain ﬁltering, we ﬁrst
reconstruct hazardous paths using the proposed scheme
described in Section 3. We then extract all domains on the
paths. Note that all domains on the path reach more than
one malicious URL, while domains that did not appear on
hazardous paths are not known to reach any malicious URLs.
Finally, we analyze the risk levels of the URLs on hazardous
paths using the risk level R(domain) deﬁned in Section 4.2.
