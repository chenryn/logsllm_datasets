User: I'm trying to access a usb device through python but I'm unsure how to find the path to it.
The example I'm going from is:
pipe = open('/dev/input/js0','r')
In which case this is either a mac or linux path. I don't know how to find the path for windows.
Could someone steer me in the proper direction? I've sifted through the forums but couldn't quite find my answer.
Thanks,

Assistant: The default USB path on windows is D:\. So, if we have a text document named mydoc.txt, which is in the folder myData the appropriate path is D:\myData\mydoc.txt
