also holds true for the ﬁrst packet of a packet pair.
Thus, a smaller packet size decreases the chances of queu-
ing of the second packet, while the probability of queuing
of the ﬁrst packet is independent of the packet size. Conse-
quently, we conclude that smaller packet sizes have a larger
probability of going through without suﬀering any queuing.

Yet, previous authors [4] have shown that while small
packet sizes can reduce under-estimation, they can also in-
crease over-estimation. So, is our observation in conﬂict
with these earlier observations? Our observations are actu-
ally entirely consistent with these earlier observations. Ac-
cording to our observation, the second packet has a smaller
probability of being queued when the packet size is de-
creased. Though this decrease in packet size does not change
the probability of queuing of the ﬁrst packet, the “relative”
probability of queuing of the ﬁrst packet with respect to
the second packet is increased. This increases the proba-
bility of over-estimation. Note though that decreasing the
size reduces the queuing probability of the packet pair and
thus leads to a higher probability for the packet pair to go
through without being queued. Increasing the packet size
has the opposite eﬀect.
Another eﬀect of decreasing the packet size is that the
“magnitude” of over-estimation is also increased. To explain
this, suppose the ﬁrst packet suﬀers more queuing than the
second, leading to compression of the packet pair. Clearly,
the compression ratio will be larger when the original dis-
persion is smaller, i.e., when packet sizes are smaller.
To explain these observations further, we present results
of a simulation consisting of a 6-hop path with link band-
widths = 10, 7.5, 5.5, 4, 6, 8 Mbps. Cross-traﬃc was path-
persistent and long-range dependent (LRD). Path-persistent
and non-persistent stand for the two extreme cases of cross
traﬃc routing as shown in Figure 4. The path persistent
cross-traﬃc packets follow the same path as the packet pair
Figure 6: Probability that a sample does not suﬀer
queuing when cross-traﬃc packet size is 550 bytes.
(Figure 4(a)), whereas the non-persistent cross-traﬃc pack-
ets exit one hop after they enter the path (Figure 4(b)). In
order to model LRD traﬃc, we used a number of Pareto
sources with shape parameter α = 1.9 [16]. NS-2 [1] was
used as the simulation environment. The cross-traﬃc packet
size was uniformly distributed between 40 and 1500 bytes.
The cross-traﬃc created a traﬃc load of 50% on the nar-
row link. This is similar to the scenario used by Dovrolis et
al [4]. Figure 5(a) shows the frequency of occurrence of a
bandwidth sample when the probe packet size is 100 bytes.
Figure 5(b) shows the same when the probe packet size is
1500 bytes.
In Figure 5(a), over-estimated capacity occurs with a high
frequency, while in Figure 5(b), under-estimation is predom-
inant. Clearly, smaller probing packet sizes lead to a higher
chance of over-estimation. Yet, in Figure 5(a), the capacity
mode (i.e., the capacity with highest frequency of occur-
rence) occurs with a relative frequency of almost 25%, while
in Figure 5(b), the capacity mode occurs with a frequency
of less than 4%. Thus, even though smaller probing packets
increase the chances of over-estimation relative to chances of
under-estimation, smaller probe packets have higher chances
of accurate estimation.
We also found that the probability of a packet pair not
suﬀering queuing was around 13% when the probing packet
size was 100 bytes. Note that this probability is smaller than
the frequency of occurrence of the correct capacity, since the
latter can include some samples where both packets suﬀered
queuing delay by the same amount, and thus dispersion re-
ﬂected the right capacity. When packet size was 1500 bytes,
this probability was around 1.5%.
We thus see that decreasing the packet size of the pair
leads to a higher probability of obtaining a sample that does
not suﬀer any queuing. This means that CapProbe should
work best when the probing packet size is the smallest possi-
ble. Due to the impact of operating system clock granularity,
there are practical limits to how much the probing packet
size can be reduced. The authors in [11] and [4] have also
addressed this issue. Since dispersion of a packet pair is a
function of the packet size of the second packet, the larger
the second packet’s size, the easier it will be for clocks to
measure dispersion accurately. We discuss the issue of probe
packet sizing further in Section 6.
We studied via simulation the eﬀect of probing packet size
on the probability of obtaining a queuing-free packet pair
sample. Using the same topology as above, we performed
simulations for LRD cross traﬃc. Probing packet pairs were
sent every 200msec. The size of probing packets and the
traﬃc load on the links was varied. Figure 6 shows the

probability of obtaining queuing-free probing packet pairs
when cross-traﬃc packet size is 550 bytes. The legend shows
probing packet sizes. The graph shows that packet pairs
with smaller packet size have a higher probability of not
hitting any queues, which is consistent with our explanation
above.
5. DERIVATION OF NON-QUEUING
PROBABILITY
CapProbe estimates capacity accurately once a packet
pair goes through the path with no queuing due to inter-
fering traﬃc. The probability of obtaining such a sample,
which we call a “good” sample,
is an indication of how
quickly CapProbe converges to a correct capacity estimate.
Below, we determine the probability of obtaining a good
sample and from that, the average number of samples re-
quired for convergence.
We present a queuing model that can predict the prob-
ability of a “good” sample for a single link in the case
of Poisson, Deterministic and Pareto On/Oﬀ cross traﬃc
(CT) with deterministic packet size, since these distribu-
tions produce packet ﬂows with signiﬁcantly diﬀerent vari-
ance in inter-arrival time and thus pose diﬀerent challenges
to CapProbe. We use simulations to extend our evaluation
to the case of LRD traﬃc, which does not lend itself easily
to analytic modeling. Finally, we extend our evaluation to
a path consisting of multiple links with cross-traﬃc being
path-persistent, non-persistent, and a combination of these
two.
An assumption we make here is that packet pairs arrive
according to a Poisson distribution, and thus they take what
amounts to “a random look” at the link. This assumption
becomes more accurate as the path length increases, and the
time interval between successive packet pairs is randomly
aﬀected by various delays along the path. We also assume
that packet pairs do not constitute a signiﬁcant load on the
network since they are sent infrequently as a non-intrusive
probe. Finally, we assume that buﬀers are large enough;
that is, queues are eﬀectively inﬁnite.
We now calculate the probability that a packet pair sam-
ple is not aﬀected by cross-traﬃc at a link. There are two
ways in which cross-traﬃc can aﬀect a sample:
i) Cross-
traﬃc is present upon arrival of the ﬁrst packet; ii) Cross-
traﬃc packets arrive between the packet pair, speciﬁcally,
between the arrival instants of the two packets. We sim-
plify the analysis by disregarding the case when cross-traﬃc
packets arrive between a packet pair but do not cause the
second packet to queue, and thus our analysis is rather con-
servative and tends to over-estimate the number of samples
N required for convergence.
5.1 Poisson Cross Trafﬁc
For condition (i) to be false, no cross-traﬃc packets should
be found upon arrival of the ﬁrst packet. The probability
p1 that the ﬁrst packet arrives to an empty system, is given
by:
p1 = 1 − λ/µ
where λ and µ are the traﬃc arrival rate to the link and the
service rate of the link, respectively.
For condition (ii) to be false, there should be no arrivals
between the packet pair. If the dispersion of the packet pair
is denoted as τ , the probability p0 of no arrivals during τ is
given by [10]:
−λτ
p0 = e
The probability plink, of no queuing and therefore no dis-
tortion at the link is equal to the product of p1 and p0:
plink = p0p1
The expected number of samples, N , needed to obtain a
good sample on a given link is given by:
∞(cid:88)
k=1
N =
kplink(1 − plink)k−1 =

plink
We perform NS-2 simulations to evaluate the values of
N for a single link of capacity 4Mbps. Studies have shown
that Internet traﬃc consists of primarily 3 packet sizes, 40,
550 and 1500 bytes [13]. We evaluate N for cross-traﬃc
composed only of one of these packet sizes. The probing
packet size is ﬁxed at 500 bytes and the dispersion τ is set
to 0.4msec, corresponding to link capacity of 10Mbps. Note
that all simulation results presented in this section are the
averages of 10 runs with diﬀerent seeds for random number
generation. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, these parameters are
used in all the simulation studies presented in this section.
In Figure 7(a), we show analytical and simulation results
for values of N when cross traﬃc is Poisson. The curves rep-
resent cross traﬃc of diﬀerent packet sizes, and the packet
sizes are shown in the legend. We found that simulation

results for Poisson cross-traﬃc match the analytically ob-
tained curves very well. We observed that smaller cross-
traﬃc packets tend to reduce the probability of obtaining
good samples, since at the same link load, cross traﬃc with
smaller packets has higher packet arrival rate λ, which re-
sults in a higher chance of the second packet being queued.
Considering that the Internet consists of a combination of
small and large packets, we expect CapProbe to be able
to converge rather quickly when the arrivals of cross traﬃc
packets is closer to Poisson distribution.
5.2 Deterministic Cross Trafﬁc
Deterministic cross traﬃc packets arrive at the link peri-
odically, so we consider one inter-arrival period of length
1/λ. As shown in Figure 8,
if we denote the transmis-
sion time of a cross-traﬃc packet as tx, the arrival of the
packet pair must occur after the transmission of the ﬁrst
cross-traﬃc packet to avoid the queuing of the ﬁrst probing
packet. In addition, since the dispersion of the packet pair
is τ , the ﬁrst probing packet must arrive early enough be-
fore the arrival of the next cross-traﬃc packet to allow the
second probing packet to start transmission without being
queued. In other words, the ﬁrst probing packet must arrive
during the shaded time interval in Figure 8. Therefore, the
probability of no queuing is calculated as follows:
plink = max(0, 1 − tx + τ
) = max(0, 1 − λ(tx + τ ))
1
λ
The analytical and simulation results for Deterministic
cross traﬃc are shown in Figure 7(b). It is clear that the
analytical results match simulation results very well. Note
that when the cross-traﬃc packet size is 40 bytes, good sam-
ples can only be obtained at very light load of 0.1. When link
load increases, the higher arrival rate and thus shorter inter-
arrival time of the cross-traﬃc packets prevent the packet
pair from going through the link without being queued.
However, as cross-traﬃc packet size increases, a good sample
can normally be obtained in less than 20 samples.
5.3 Pareto On/Off Cross Trafﬁc
For Pareto on/oﬀ cross traﬃc, the source enters ON and
OFF state alternately. In the ON state, the source transmits
packets at a deterministic rate, whereas in the OFF state,
the source does not transmit any packets. The time for a
source to remain in ON or OFF state follows Pareto distri-
butions. In our model, we assume the ON and OFF periods
are independently identically distributed, i.e., the probabil-
ity density function (pdf) f (t) of the ON/OFF time periods
t and its mean ¯t are given by:
f (t) =
αkα
tα+1
0  tx + τ , the link has idle time in both ON
and OFF periods, and the idle time in ON periods is long
enough for a packet pair to arrive without suﬀering queu-
ing. In other words, good samples can occur in both ON
and OFF periods. Considering ON and OFF periods sepa-
rately, the conditional probability of obtaining a good sam-
ple given that the source is in ON state can be obtained in a
similar way as the Deterministic cross traﬃc case shown in
Section 5.2, whereas the conditional probability given that
the source is in OFF state is equal to P [Y ≥ τ ] in case 1.
Thus, by conditioning and un-conditioning on the state of
the source, the probability of obtaining a good sample can
be formulated as:
plink =
