### Issue Type:
Bug Report

### Ansible Version:
1.5.5

### Environment:
CentOS 5.9

### Summary:
We are using Ansible to run `puppet agent`, which by default (and very helpfully) uses colors to indicate the severity of log messages. When `puppet` is run with the default settings (`color=on`), there is no output from Ansible. However, when it is run with `--color=false`, Ansible displays the output. We would like to preserve the Puppet color codes as they are valuable for identifying issues.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Run the `puppet agent -t` (or any other `puppet apply` command) on a system using Ansible.
2. Execute the following command:
   ```sh
   [root@localhost ~]# ansible server.example.com -m shell -a 'puppet agent -t --noop' -v
   ```

### Expected Results:
The expected output should be similar to the following, but with ANSI color codes preserved:
```sh
[root@localhost ~]# ansible server.example.com -m shell -a 'puppet agent -t --noop' -v
server.example.com | success | rc=0 >>
info: Retrieving plugin
info: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/facter_dot_d.rb
info: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/puppet_vardir.rb
info: Caching catalog for server.example.com
info: Applying configuration version '1400866037'
notice: Finished catalog run in 8.13 seconds
[root@localhost ~]#
```

### Actual Results:
The actual output is as follows, with no visible output from Puppet:
```sh
[root@localhost ~]# ansible server.example.com -m shell -a 'puppet agent -t --noop' -v
server.example.com | success | rc=0 >>
[root@localhost ~]#
```
