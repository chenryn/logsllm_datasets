##### Issue Type:
Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
1.5.5
##### Environment:
CentOS 5.9
##### Summary:
We are using Ansible to run puppet agent, which by default (and very
helpfully) uses colors to indicate severity of logs. When puppet is run with
default (color=on) settings, there is no output from Ansible; when it is run
with ("--color=false") then ansible displays the output. We would like to have
puppet colors preserved since they are of value to spotting issues.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
Run the "puppet agent -t" (or other puppet apply command) on a system using
Ansible.
    [root@localhost ~]# ansible server.example.com -m shell -a 'puppet agent -t --noop' -v
##### Expected Results:
Expected to see something like below (but with ANSI colors):
    [root@localhost ~]# ansible  server.example.com -m shell -a 'puppet agent -t --noop' -v
    server.example.com | success | rc=0 >>
    info: Retrieving plugin
    info: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/facter_dot_d.rb
    info: Loading facts in /var/lib/puppet/lib/facter/puppet_vardir.rb

    [root@localhost ~]#
##### Actual Results:
E.g.
    [root@localhost ~]# ansible server.example.com -m shell -a 'puppet agent -t --noop' -v
    server.example.com | success | rc=0 >>
    [root@localhost ~]#
