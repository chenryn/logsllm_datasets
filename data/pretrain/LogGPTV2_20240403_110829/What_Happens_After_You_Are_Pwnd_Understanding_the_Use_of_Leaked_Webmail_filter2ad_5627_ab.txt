### Dumping Pages to Disk for Offline Parsing

To facilitate offline parsing, we dump the pages to disk. By collecting information from visitor activity pages, we obtain location and system configuration details of accesses, as provided by Google's geolocation and system configuration fingerprinting system.

### Honey Account and Monitoring Framework

We believe that our honey account and monitoring framework offer multiple possibilities for researchers interested in studying the behavior of attackers in webmail accounts. For this reason, we have released the source code of our system. [Source Code](https://bitbucket.org/gianluca_students/gmail-honeypot)

### 3.2 Experiment Setup

#### Honey Account Setup

As part of our experiments, we first set up a number of honey accounts on Gmail and then leaked them through various outlets used by cybercriminals.

- **Account Creation:**
  - We created 100 Gmail accounts, assigning them random combinations of popular first and last names, similar to the approach in [31].
  - The creation and setup of these accounts is a manual process.
  - Google rate-limits the creation of new accounts from the same IP address, requiring phone verification after a few accounts are created. This limited the number of honey accounts we could set up in practice.

- **Populating Accounts:**
  - We populated the newly created accounts with emails from the public Enron email dataset [22], which contains emails sent by Enron executives and was released as evidence in the company's bankruptcy trial.
  - To make the honey accounts believable, we mapped distinct recipients in the Enron dataset to our fictional characters (the "owners" of the honey accounts) and replaced the original names with our honey account names.
  - We also changed all instances of "Enron" to a fictitious company name.
  - To ensure realistic email timestamps, we translated the old Enron email timestamps to recent times slightly earlier than our experiment start date, maintaining the relative order of the timestamps.
  - We sent between 200 to 300 emails from the Enron dataset to each honey account during the population process.

#### Leaking Account Credentials

To achieve our objectives, we needed to entice cybercriminals to interact with our account honeypots while logging their accesses. We selected paste sites, underground forums, and malware as appropriate venues for leaking account credentials.

- **Paste Sites:**
  - We leaked 50 accounts in total on paste sites.
  - For 20 accounts, we leaked basic credentials (username and password pairs) on popular paste sites like pastebin.com and pastie.org.
  - For 10 accounts, we leaked credentials on Russian paste websites (p.for-us.nl and paste.org.ru).
  - For the remaining 20 accounts, we leaked username and password pairs along with UK and US location information and date of birth for the fictitious personas.

- **Underground Forums:**
  - We leaked 30 account credentials on underground forums.
  - For 10 accounts, we only specified username and password pairs without additional information.
  - For the other 20 accounts, we appended UK and US location information and date of birth.
  - We used forums such as offensivecommunity.net, bestblackhatforums.eu, hack-forums.net, and blackhatworld.com, which were open for registration and highly ranked in Google results.
  - We mimicked the modus operandi of cybercriminals as outlined by Stone-Gross et al. [30], posting samples of stolen datasets and promising additional data in exchange for a fee.

- **Malware:**
  - We leaked access credentials of 20 accounts to information-stealing malware samples, specifically from the Zeus and Corebot families.
  - Our malware sandbox system involves a web server managing honey credentials and malware samples, and a host machine creating a Virtual Machine (VM) to execute the malware and log in to Gmail using the downloaded credentials.
  - After some time, the infected VM is deleted, and a fresh one is created to repeat the process.

### 3.3 Threats to Validity

- **Email Dataset Bias:**
  - Using the Enron dataset may introduce bias into our results and make the honey accounts less believable.
  - We changed names, dates, and company names to make the emails more believable.
  - Future work will aim to obtain or generate a better email dataset.

- **Lack of New Emails:**
  - Visitors may notice that the honey accounts did not receive any new emails during the observation period, which may affect how criminals interact with the accounts.

- **Outlet Limitations:**
  - Our results reflect the activity of participants present on the specific outlets we used (paste sites, underground forums, and malware).
  - We only used publicly accessible underground forums, which may not reflect the behavior of actors on closed forums.

### 3.4 Ethics

- **Risk Management:**
  - We configured our honey accounts to forward all emails to a sinkhole mailserver under our control and never deliver them to the outside world.
  - We collaborated closely with Google to report any malicious activity and disable suspicious login filters for our honey accounts.
  - Our approach does not rely on help from Google, but disabling the filters ensured that all accesses got through to the honey accounts.

- **Malware Containment:**
  - We restricted the bandwidth available to our virtual machines and sinkholed all email traffic sent by them to prevent harm to third parties.

- **Deception:**
  - We provided fake accounts with fake personal information, obtaining IRB approval from our institution to ensure ethical conduct.

### 4. Data Analysis

We monitored the activity on our honey accounts for 7 months, from June 25, 2015, to February 16, 2016. In this section, we provide an overview of our results and discuss a taxonomy of the types of activity observed.

#### 4.1 Overview

- **Accesses:**
  - We created, instrumented, and leaked 100 Gmail accounts.
  - After filtering out accesses from our monitoring infrastructure, we observed 326 unique accesses, 147 emails opened, 845 emails sent, and 12 unique draft emails composed by cybercriminals.
  - 90 accounts received accesses, comprising 41 accounts leaked to paste sites, 30 to underground forums, and 19 through malware.
  - 42 accounts were blocked by Google due to suspicious activity, and 36 accounts were hijacked by cybercriminals.

- **Data Availability:**
  - A dataset containing the parsed metadata of the accesses is publicly available at [Dataset Link](http://dx.doi.org/10.14324/000.ds.1508297).

#### 4.2 A Taxonomy of Account Activity

From our dataset, we devised a taxonomy of attackers based on unique accesses to the honey accounts:

- **Curious:**
  - These accesses involve logging in to check if the credentials work, with no further action. They accounted for 224 accesses.
  - This large number of curious accesses may be due to experienced attackers avoiding interactions after logging in, potentially introducing bias.

- **Gold Diggers:**
  - These attackers search for sensitive information, such as financial-related names and spearphishing material, upon logging in.
  - Previous research [13] showed this practice is common for manual account hijackers.
  - We confirm this finding and provide a methodology to assess the keywords searched by cybercriminals, analyzing differences in their modus operandi for credentials leaked through different outlets.
