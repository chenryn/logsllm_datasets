Global Unicast Addresses 
Global unicast addresses are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses. They are globally routable and 
reachable on the IPv6 portion of the Internet, known as the IPv6 Internet. 
Global unicast addresses can be aggregated or summarized to produce an efficient routing 
infrastructure. The current IPv4-based Internet is a mixture of both flat and hierarchical routing, but the 
IPv6-based Internet has been designed from its foundation to support efficient, hierarchical addressing 
and routing. Global unicast addresses are unique across their scope, which is the entire IPv6 Internet. 
For more information about routing infrastructure including route aggregation and summarization, see 
Chapter 5, "IP Routing." 
Figure 3-7 shows the general structure of a global unicast address as defined in RFC 3587.

Figure 3-8 shows the structure of global unicast addresses being allocated by IANA at the time of this 
writing, as defined in RFC 3587.

The fields in the global unicast address are: 
Fixed Portion (set to 001) 
The three high-order bits are set to 001. The address prefix for currently assigned global addresses 
is 2000::/3. 
Global Routing Prefix 
The global routing prefix identifies a specific organization's site. The combination of the three fixed 
bits and the 45-bit Global Routing Prefix is used to create a 48-bit site address prefix, which is 
assigned to the individual sites of an organization. Once assigned, routers on the IPv6 Internet 
forward IPv6 traffic matching the 48-bit address prefix to the routers of the organization's site. 
Subnet ID 
The Subnet ID identifies subnets within an organization's site. This field is 16 bits long. The 
organization's site can use these 16 bits within its site to create 65,536 subnets or multiple levels of 
addressing hierarchy and an efficient routing infrastructure. 
Interface ID 
The Interface ID indicates an interface on a subnet within the site. This field is 64 bits long.  
For example, 2001:DB8:2A3C:F282:2B0:D0FF:FEE9:4143 is a global unicast IPv6 address. Within this 
address: 
2001:DB8:2A3C indicates an organization's site 
F282 indicates a subnet within that site 
2B0:D0FF:FEE9:4143 indicates an interface on that subnet within that site 
The fields within the global unicast address as defined in RFC 3587 create a three-level structure, as 
Figure 3-9 shows. 
Figure 3-9  The three-level structure of a global unicast address as defined in RFC 3587 
The public topology is the collection of larger and smaller ISPs that provide access to the IPv6 Internet 
and the organizations that connect to the IPv6 Internet. The site topology is the collection of subnets

within an organization’s site. The interface identifier identifies a specific interface on a subnet within an 
organization’s site. 
Local-use unicast addresses fall into two categories: 
Link-local addresses are used between on-link neighbors and for Neighbor Discovery processes, which 
define how nodes on an IPv6 subnet interact with hosts and routers. 
Site-local addresses are used between nodes communicating with other nodes in the same site of an 
organization’s intranet. 
Link-Local Addresses 
Nodes use link-local addresses when communicating with neighboring nodes on the same link, also 
known as a subnet. For example, on a single-link IPv6 network with no router, link-local addresses are 
used to communicate between hosts on the link. Link-local addresses are equivalent to APIPA IPv4 
addresses autoconfigured on computers that are running Windows. The scope of a link-local address 
(the region of the network across which the address is unique) is the local link. 
A link-local address is required for Neighbor Discovery processes and is always automatically 
configured, even in the absence of all other unicast addresses.  
For more information about IPv6 address autoconfiguration for link-local addresses, see Chapter 6, 
"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol." 
Figure 3-10 shows the structure of the link-local address. 
Figure 3-10  Structure of the link-local address 
Because the first 64 bits of the link-local address are fixed, the address prefix for all link-local addresses 
is FE80::/64. 
An IPv6 router never forwards link-local traffic beyond the link. 
Site-Local Addresses 
Site-local addresses are equivalent to the IPv4 private address space. Private intranets that do not 
have a direct, routed connection to the IPv6 Internet can use site-local addresses without conflicting 
with global addresses. Site-local addresses are not reachable from other sites, and routers must not 
forward site-local traffic outside the site. Site-local addresses can be used in addition to global 
addresses. The scope of a site-local address is a site (a portion of an organization network that has 
defined geographical, topological, or network bandwidth boundaries). 
Unlike link-local addresses, site-local addresses are not automatically configured and must be assigned 
either through stateless or stateful address configuration. 
Figure 3-11 shows the structure of the site-local address. 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 74 
Figure 3-11  Structure of the site-local address 
The first 10 bits of site-local addresses are fixed at 1111 1110 11. Therefore, the address prefix for all 
site-local addresses is FEC0::/10. Beyond the 10 high-order fixed bits is a 54-bit Subnet ID field that 
you can use to create subnets within your organization. With 54 bits, you can have up to 254 subnets in 
a flat subnet structure, or you can subdivide the high-order bits of the Subnet ID field to create a 
hierarchical and summarizable routing infrastructure. After the Subnet ID field is a 64-bit Interface ID 
field that identifies a specific interface on a subnet.  
Note  RFC 3879 formally deprecates the use of site-local addresses for future IPv6 implementations. 
Existing implementations of IPv6 can continue to use site-local addresses. RFC 4291 and includes the 
deprecation of site-local addresses. 
Zone IDs for Local-Use Addresses 
Local-use addresses are not unique within an organization intranet. Link-local addresses can be 
duplicated per link (subnet). Site-local addresses can be duplicated per site. Therefore, when specifying 
a link-local destination address, you must specify the link on which the destination is located. For a site-
local destination address when you are using multiple sites, you must specify the site in which the 
destination is located. You use a zone ID to specify the portion or zone of the network on which the 
destination can be reached. In the Ping, Tracert, and Pathping commands, the syntax for specifying a 
zone ID is IPv6Address%ZoneID.  
For link-local destinations, ZoneID is typically equal to the interface index of the interface attached to 
the link on which the destination is located. The interface index is an internal number assigned to an 
IPv6 interface that is visible from the display of the netsh interface ipv6 show interface command. 
For site-local addresses, ZoneID is equal to the site number that is visible from the display of the netsh 
interface ipv6 show address level=verbose command. If multiple sites are not being used, a zone ID 
for site-local addresses is not required. The ZoneID parameter is not needed when the destination is a 
global unicast address. 
Unique Local Addresses 
Site-local addresses provide a private addressing alternative to using global addresses for intranet 
traffic. However, because the site-local address prefix can be reused to address multiple sites within an 
organization, a site-local address prefix can be duplicated. The ambiguity of site-local addresses in an 
organization adds complexity and difficulty for applications, routers, and network managers. For more 
information, see section 2 of RFC 3879.  
To replace site-local addresses with a new type of address that is private to an organization, yet unique 
across all of the sites of the organization, RFC 4193 defines unique local IPv6 unicast addresses. 
Figure 3-12 shows the structure of unique local addresses.  
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 75 
Figure 3-12   The unique local address 
The first 7 bits have the fixed binary value of 1111110. All unique local addresses have the address 
prefix FC00::/7. The Local (L) flag is set 1 to indicate a local address. The L flag value set to 0 has not 
yet been defined. Therefore, unique local addresses with the L flag set to 1 have the address prefix of 
FD00::/8. The Global ID identifies a specific site within an organization and is set to a randomly derived 
40-bit value. By deriving a random value for the Global ID, an organization can have statistically unique 
48-bit prefixes assigned to the sites of their organizations. Additionally, two organizations that use 
unique local addresses that merge have a low probability of duplicating a 48-bit unique local address 
prefix, minimizing site renumbering. Unlike the Global Routing Prefix in global addresses, you should 
not assign Global IDs in unique local address prefixes so that they can be summarized.  
The global address and unique local address share the same structure beyond the first 48 bits of the 
address. In global addresses, the Subnet ID field identifies the subnet within an organization. For 
unique local addresses, the Subnet ID field can perform the same function. Therefore, you can create a 
subnet numbering scheme that can be used for both local and global unicast addresses. 
Special IPv6 Addresses 
The following are special IPv6 addresses: 
Unspecified address 
The unspecified address (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 or ::) indicates the absence of an address and is 
equivalent to the IPv4 unspecified address of 0.0.0.0. The unspecified address is typically used as 
a source address for packets attempting to verify the uniqueness of a tentative address. The 
unspecified address is never assigned to an interface or used as a destination address. 
Loopback address 
The loopback address (0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 or ::1) identifies a loopback interface. This address enables a 
node to send packets to itself and is equivalent to the IPv4 loopback address of 127.0.0.1. Packets 
addressed to the loopback address are never sent on a link or forwarded by an IPv6 router. 
Transition Addresses 
To aid in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, the following addresses are defined: 
IPv4-compatible address 
The IPv4-compatible address, 0:0:0:0:0:0:w.x.y.z or ::w.x.y.z (where w.x.y.z is the dotted decimal 
representation of a public IPv4 address), is used by IPv6/IPv4 nodes that are communicating using 
IPv6. IPv6/IPv4 nodes are nodes with both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. When the IPv4-compatible 
address is used as an IPv6 destination, the IPv6 traffic is automatically encapsulated with an IPv4 
header and sent to the destination using the IPv4 infrastructure. IPv6 for Windows Server 2003 and 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 76 
Windows XP supports IPv4-compatible addresses, but they are disabled by default. IPv6 for 
Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista does not support IPv4-compatible addresses. 
IPv4-mapped address 
The IPv4-mapped address, 0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:w.x.y.z or ::FFFF:w.x.y.z, represents an IPv4-only node 
to an IPv6 node. IPv4-mapped addresses are used for internal representation only. The IPv4-
mapped address is never used as a source or destination address of an IPv6 packet. IPv6 for 
Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP does not support IPv4-mapped addresses. IPv6 for 
Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista supports IPv4-mapped addresses. 
6to4 address 
The 6to4 address is used for communicating between two nodes running both IPv4 and IPv6 over 
the Internet. You form the 6to4 address by combining the global prefix 2002::/16 with the 32 bits of 
a public IPv4 address of the node, forming a 48-bit prefix. 6to4 is an IPv6 transition technology 
described in RFC 3056. 
ISATAP address 
The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) defines ISATAP addresses used 
between two nodes running both IPv4 and IPv6 over a private intranet. ISATAP addresses use the 
locally administered interface ID ::0:5EFE:w.x.y.z in which w.x.y.z is a private IPv4 address and 
::200:5EFE:w.x.y.z in which w.x.y.z is a public IPv4 address. You can combine the ISATAP 
interface ID with any 64-bit prefix that is valid for IPv6 unicast addresses, including the link-local 
address prefix (FE80::/64), unique local prefixes, and global prefixes. ISATAP is an IPv6 transition 
technology described in RFC 4214. 
Teredo address 
The Teredo address is used for communicating between two nodes running both IPv4 and IPv6 
over the Internet when one or both of the endpoints are located behind an IPv4 network address 
translation (NAT) device. You form the Teredo address by combining the 2001::/32-bit Teredo 
prefix with the public IPv4 address of a Teredo server and other elements. Teredo is an IPv6 
transition technology described in RFC 4380. 
For more information about IPv4-compatible, 6to4, ISATAP, and Teredo addresses, see Chapter 15, 
"IPv6 Transition Technologies." 
IPv6 Interface Identifiers 
The last 64 bits of a unicast IPv6 address are the interface identifier that is unique to the 64-bit prefix of 
the IPv6 address. IPv6 interface identifiers are determined as follows: 
A permanent interface identifier that is randomly derived. This is the default for Windows Server 2008 
and Windows Vista. 
An interface identifier that is derived from the Extended Unique Identifier (EUI)-64 address. This is the 
default for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP.  
A randomly generated interface identifier that changes over time to provide a level of anonymity.  
An interface identifier that is assigned during stateful address autoconfiguration (for example, through 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IP version 6 [DHCPv6]). 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 77 
EUI-64 Address-based Interface Identifiers 
RFC 4291 states that all unicast addresses that use the prefixes 001 through 111 must also use a 64-
bit interface identifier derived from the EUI-64 address, a 64-bit address that is defined by the IEEE. 
EUI-64 addresses are either assigned to a network adapter or derived from IEEE 802 addresses. 
A traditional interface identifier for a network adapter uses a 48-bit address called an IEEE 802 
address. It consists of a 24-bit company ID (also called the manufacturer ID) and a 24-bit extension ID 
(also called the board ID). The combination of the company ID, which is uniquely assigned to each 
manufacturer of network adapters, and the board ID, which is uniquely assigned to each network 
adapter at the time of assembly, produces a globally unique 48-bit address. This 48-bit address is also 
called the physical, hardware, or MAC address. 
Figure 3-13 shows the structure of the 48-bit IEEE 802 address.  
Figure 3-13  Structure of the 48-bit IEEE 802 address 
Defined bits within the IEEE 802 address are: 
Universal/Local (U/L) 
The next-to-the-low-order bit in the first byte indicates whether the address is universally or locally 
administered. If the U/L bit is set to 0, the IEEE (through the designation of a unique company ID) 
has administered the address. If the U/L bit is set to 1, the address is locally administered. The 
network administrator has overridden the manufactured address and specified a different address. 
The U/L bit is designated by the u in Figure 3-13. 
Individual/Group (I/G) 
The low order bit of the first byte indicates whether the address is an individual address (unicast) or 
a group address (multicast). When set to 0, the address is a unicast address. When set to 1, the 
address is a multicast address. The I/G bit is designated by the g in Figure 3-13. 
For a typical 802 network adapter address, both the U/L and I/G bits are set to 0, corresponding to a 
universally administered, unicast MAC address. 
The IEEE EUI-64 address represents a new standard for network interface addressing. The company 
ID is still 24 bits long, but the extension ID is 40 bits, creating a much larger address space for a 
network adapter manufacturer. The EUI-64 address uses the U/L and I/G bits in the same way as the 
IEEE 802 address. 
Figure 3-14 shows the structure of the EUI-64 address.  
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 78 
Figure 3-14  Structure of the EUI-64 address 
Figure 3-15 shows how to create an EUI-64 address from an IEEE 802 address. You insert the 16 bits 
11111111 11111110 (0xFFFE) into the IEEE 802 address between the company ID and the extension 
ID. 
Figure 3-15  Converting an IEEE 802 address to an EUI-64 address 
To obtain the 64-bit interface identifier for IPv6 unicast addresses, the U/L bit in the EUI-64 address is 
complemented. (If it is a 1, it is set to 0; and if it is a 0, it is set to 1.) Figure 3-16 shows the conversion 
for a universally administered, unicast EUI-64 address. 
Figure 3-16  Converting a universally administered, unicast EUI-64 address to an IPv6 interface identifier 
Chapter 3 – IP Addressing 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 79 
To obtain an IPv6 interface identifier from an IEEE 802 address, you must first map the IEEE 802 
address to an EUI-64 address, and then you complement the U/L bit. Figure 3-17 shows this 
conversion for a universally administered, unicast IEEE 802 address. 
Figure 3-17  Converting a universally administered, unicast IEEE 802 address to an IPv6 interface identifier 
IEEE 802 Address Conversion Example 
Host A has the Ethernet MAC address of 00-AA-00-3F-2A-1C. First, you convert it to EUI-64 format by 
inserting FF-FE between the third and fourth bytes, yielding 00-AA-00-FF-FE-3F-2A-1C. Then you 
complement the U/L bit, which is the seventh bit in the first byte. The first byte in binary form is 
00000000. When you complement the seventh bit, it becomes 00000010 (0x02). When you convert the 
final result, 02-AA-00-FF-FE-3F-2A-1C, to colon hexadecimal notation, it becomes the interface 
identifier 2AA:FF:FE3F:2A1C. As a result, the link-local address that corresponds to the network 
adapter with the MAC address of 00-AA-00-3F-2A-1C is FE80::2AA:FF:FE3F:2A1C. 
When you complement the U/L bit, add 0x2 to the first byte if the address is universally administered, 
and subtract 0x2 from the first byte if the address is locally administered. 
Temporary Address Interface Identifiers 
In today’s IPv4-based Internet, a typical Internet user connects to an Internet service provider (ISP) and 
obtains an IPv4 address using the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and the Internet Protocol Control 
Protocol (IPCP). Each time the user connects, a different IPv4 address might be obtained, making it 
difficult to track a dial-up user’s traffic on the Internet on the basis of an IPv4 address.
