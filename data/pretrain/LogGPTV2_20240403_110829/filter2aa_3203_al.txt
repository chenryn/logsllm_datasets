### IPv6 Addressing Overview

IPv6 addresses are designed to provide a vast address space and improved routing efficiency. The following sections detail the various types of IPv6 addresses, their structures, and their specific uses.

#### 1. Global Unicast Addresses
Global unicast addresses are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses. They are globally routable and reachable on the IPv6 Internet. These addresses can be aggregated or summarized to create an efficient routing infrastructure. The current IPv4-based Internet is a mix of flat and hierarchical routing, whereas the IPv6-based Internet is designed from the ground up to support efficient, hierarchical addressing and routing.

- **Scope**: The entire IPv6 Internet.
- **Structure** (as defined in RFC 3587):
  - **Fixed Portion (001)**: The three high-order bits are set to 001. The address prefix for currently assigned global addresses is 2000::/3.
  - **Global Routing Prefix**: Identifies a specific organization's site. The combination of the fixed bits and the 45-bit Global Routing Prefix creates a 48-bit site address prefix.
  - **Subnet ID (16 bits)**: Identifies subnets within an organization's site. This allows for the creation of up to 65,536 subnets.
  - **Interface ID (64 bits)**: Indicates an interface on a subnet within the site.

**Example**:
- `2001:DB8:2A3C:F282:2B0:D0FF:FEE9:4143`
  - `2001:DB8:2A3C` indicates an organization's site.
  - `F282` indicates a subnet within that site.
  - `2B0:D0FF:FEE9:4143` indicates an interface on that subnet.

**Three-Level Structure**:
- **Public Topology**: Collection of ISPs providing access to the IPv6 Internet.
- **Site Topology**: Collection of subnets within an organizationâ€™s site.
- **Interface Identifier**: Identifies a specific interface on a subnet.

#### 2. Local-Use Unicast Addresses
Local-use unicast addresses are used for communication within a local network and are not globally routable. They fall into two categories:

- **Link-Local Addresses**:
  - Used for communication between neighboring nodes on the same link (subnet).
  - Scope: Local link.
  - **Structure**: The first 64 bits are fixed as `FE80::/64`.
  - **Example**: `FE80::1234:5678:9ABC:DEF0`

- **Site-Local Addresses** (Deprecated):
  - Used for communication within a single site (e.g., an organization's intranet).
  - Scope: A site.
  - **Structure**: The first 10 bits are fixed as `FEC0::/10`.
  - **Note**: RFC 3879 deprecates the use of site-local addresses for future IPv6 implementations.

#### 3. Unique Local Addresses
Unique local addresses are designed to replace site-local addresses. They are private and unique across all sites of an organization.

- **Structure**:
  - **First 7 bits (1111110)**: Fixed binary value.
  - **Address Prefix**: `FC00::/7`.
  - **Local (L) Flag**: Set to 1 to indicate a local address. The address prefix with the L flag set to 1 is `FD00::/8`.
  - **Global ID (40 bits)**: Randomly derived to identify a specific site within an organization.
  - **Subnet ID (16 bits)**: Identifies subnets within the site.
  - **Interface ID (64 bits)**: Identifies an interface on a subnet.

**Example**:
- `FD00:1234:5678:ABCD:1234:5678:9ABC:DEF0`

#### 4. Special IPv6 Addresses
- **Unspecified Address (`::`)**: Indicates the absence of an address. It is never assigned to an interface or used as a destination address.
- **Loopback Address (`::1`)**: Identifies a loopback interface, enabling a node to send packets to itself.

#### 5. Transition Addresses
These addresses aid in the transition from IPv4 to IPv6:

- **IPv4-Compatible Address (`::w.x.y.z`)**: Used by dual-stack nodes (nodes with both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols). IPv6 traffic is encapsulated with an IPv4 header and sent over the IPv4 infrastructure.
- **IPv4-Mapped Address (`::FFFF:w.x.y.z`)**: Represents an IPv4-only node to an IPv6 node. Used for internal representation only.
- **6to4 Address**: Combines the global prefix `2002::/16` with a public IPv4 address, forming a 48-bit prefix.
- **ISATAP Address**: Used for communication between dual-stack nodes over a private intranet.
- **Teredo Address**: Used for communication between dual-stack nodes over the Internet when one or both endpoints are behind an IPv4 NAT device.

#### 6. IPv6 Interface Identifiers
The last 64 bits of a unicast IPv6 address form the interface identifier, which is unique to the 64-bit prefix of the IPv6 address. Interface identifiers can be determined in several ways:

- **Randomly Derived**: Default for Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista.
- **EUI-64 Address-Based**: Default for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP.
- **Randomly Generated and Changing Over Time**: For anonymity.
- **Assigned During Stateful Autoconfiguration**: Via DHCPv6.

**EUI-64 Address Conversion**:
- **IEEE 802 Address**: 48-bit address consisting of a 24-bit company ID and a 24-bit extension ID.
- **EUI-64 Address**: 64-bit address with a 24-bit company ID and a 40-bit extension ID.
- **Conversion**: Insert `FF-FE` between the company ID and extension ID, then complement the U/L bit.

**Example**:
- Ethernet MAC address: `00-AA-00-3F-2A-1C`
- EUI-64 format: `00-AA-00-FF-FE-3F-2A-1C`
- Complement U/L bit: `02-AA-00-FF-FE-3F-2A-1C`
- Interface identifier: `2AA:FF:FE3F:2A1C`
- Link-local address: `FE80::2AA:FF:FE3F:2A1C`
