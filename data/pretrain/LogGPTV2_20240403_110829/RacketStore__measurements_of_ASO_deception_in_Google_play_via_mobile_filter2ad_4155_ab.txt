### Providing Advice and Identifying Unethical Practices in ASO

Some organizations provide legitimate advice on app naming and keyword optimization, while others offer illegal, banned, or discouraged services. These unethical practices include:

- **Retention Installs**: Installing an app on multiple devices and keeping it installed for extended periods.
- **Fake Reviews**: Writing fake reviews with high ratings to boost the app's visibility.

### Studying ASO Organizations

We examine the ASO (App Store Optimization) organizations discussed in [67], as illustrated in Figure 2. These organizations typically consist of:

1. **ASO Admins**: Coordinators who manage and organize communities of workers and act as intermediaries between developers and workers.
2. **Professional Workers**: Individuals who use multiple devices and accounts dedicated solely to ASO tasks.
3. **Organic Workers**: Users who blend product promotion with their personal activities on their devices and accounts.

In this context, we informally refer to the devices and accounts used by organic workers as "organic devices" and "organic accounts."

### Hiring ASO Organizations

Developers can either directly hire ASO organizations or post job listings on online boards dedicated to ASO work. 

### ASO Communication Boards

Communication between developers, admins, and crowdsourced workers often occurs through dedicated online platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram [67]. For our study, we recruited participants from Facebook groups identified using keywords like "reviews," "google reviews," "app reviews," "app installs," and "android promotion." We found 11 public and 5 closed groups that matched our criteria, with a total of 86,718 members (Min = 354, Max = 26,896, M = 2,840.5, SD = 6,787.96). Our detailed recruitment process is outlined in § 4.

### RacketStore Platform

To measure and compare the app and device usage of ASO workers and regular users, we developed the RacketStore platform. The RacketStore architecture includes a mobile app installed by participants and a back-end server that collects and aggregates data snapshots reported by the app.

#### Key Features of RacketStore

- **Permissions**: The RacketStore app automatically grants permissions (e.g., WAKE_LOCK) upon installation and was approved by the Play Store.
- **Data Buffer Module**: This module processes snapshot data, compresses files when they reach specific sizes (slow snapshot: 8KB, fast snapshot: 100KB), and sends them to the server. The server validates the transfer using a crypto hash.
- **Device Compatibility**: RacketStore is compatible with Android versions 5.0 (Lollipop) and above, supporting 298 unique device models from 28 manufacturers.
- **Web App**: The web app supports server-side operations, including user registration, snapshot collection, and review crawling. It also includes a dashboard for researchers to monitor and validate data.
- **Security and Privacy**: RacketStore uses TLS for data encryption, securely stores participant data, and minimizes the collection of Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

### Data Collection

#### Recruitment Process

- **ASO Workers**: We recruited ASO workers from Facebook groups dedicated to product promotion. We posted calls for participants, and many expressed interest via Facebook inbox. We provided recruitment instructions and screened participants based on their experience and available devices.
- **Regular Users**: We recruited regular Android users through Instagram ads targeting similar demographics. The landing page explained the study, payment methods, and consent form. Participants were asked to register with their email and install the RacketStore app.

#### Participant Payments

- **ASO Workers and Regular Users**: Participants were paid $1 per device for installing the app and $0.2 per day for keeping the app installed. In a follow-up study, participants received $5 for every 15 minutes of their time.

### Ethical Considerations

Our study adhered to ethical guidelines for research involving vulnerable populations. Participation was voluntary, and no deception was used. The consent form clearly stated the research objectives, data collection, and potential risks. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB-19-0392@FIU).

### Data Analysis

#### Snapshot Fingerprinting and Coalescing

We collected 592,045 slow snapshots and 57,770,204 fast snapshots from 943 devices. Using a combination of install ID, participant ID, and Android ID, we identified 803 unique devices: 580 controlled by ASO workers and 223 by regular participants.

#### Google Play Review Dataset

The review crawler collected reviews posted for apps installed on participant devices every 12 hours. We also collected 217,041 reviews posted by 10,310 Gmail addresses registered on worker-controlled devices, with participant consent.

### Device Usage Measurements

We used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test and non-parametric and parametric ANOVA to compare the distributions of features between workers and regular users. The average number of daily snapshots collected from regular devices was 9,430.71 (M = 3,097.67, SD = 12,789.14, max = 63,452), and from worker devices was 8,208.10 (M = 3,669, SD = 10,303.42, max = 55,281.38).

### Registered Accounts

To post a review, a user needs a Gmail account. We investigated the number and types of accounts controlled by workers and regular users, expecting workers to have more Gmail accounts registered on their devices.

### Summary

This section provides a comprehensive overview of our study, including the unethical practices in ASO, the structure of ASO organizations, the recruitment process, the RacketStore platform, and the data analysis. Our findings highlight the differences in device usage and account management between ASO workers and regular users, contributing to a better understanding of ASO practices.
