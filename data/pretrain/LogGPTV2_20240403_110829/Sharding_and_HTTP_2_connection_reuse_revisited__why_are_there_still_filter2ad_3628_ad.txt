### Figure 3: Temporal Pattern of Overlaps by Counting Resolvers for Which Two Domains Resolve to Overlapping IPs

**Description:**
- The figure shows the temporal pattern of overlaps by counting the resolvers for which two domains resolve to overlapping IPs.
- Darker areas denote more resolvers for which the DNS answers overlapped.
- Certain domains never overlap, while others fluctuate.
- For example, `www.google-analytics.com` and `www.googletagmanager.com` did not overlap, while `fonts.gstatic.com` and `gstatic.com` sometimes overlap.
- Time and vantage point influence whether domains resolve to the same IP and whether connection reuse is effective.

### Table 9: Top 5 Certificate Issuers w.r.t. Redundant Connections of Cause CERT and Unique Domains

| Certificate Issuer | ↑ Conns. | Domains |
|--------------------|----------|---------|

| Let’s Encrypt | 351 | 2 |
| DigiCert Inc | 246 | 3 |
| Sectigo Limited | 185 | 110 |

### Figure 3: Number of DNS Vantage Points Where Domains Overlapped

**Description:**
- The figure shows the number of DNS vantage points where domains overlapped over time.
- The x-axis represents the time, and the y-axis represents the number of resolvers with overlap.
- The darker areas indicate more resolvers for which the DNS answers overlapped.
- The data was collected from September 19, 2021, to September 27, 2021, at 00:00 intervals.
