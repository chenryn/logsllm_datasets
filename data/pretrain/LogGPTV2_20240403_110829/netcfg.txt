**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `netcfg` command is used to install, configure, and manage network components in the Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE). WinPE is a lightweight version of Windows that is commonly used for deploying workstations.

**Syntax:**
```shell
netcfg [/v] [/e] [/winpe] [/l <INF file path>] /c <component class> /i <component ID>
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/v` | Runs the command in verbose mode, providing detailed output. |
| `/e` | Uses servicing environment variables during installation and uninstallation. |
| `/winpe` | Installs TCP/IP, NetBIOS, and Microsoft Client for the Windows preinstallation environment (WinPE). |
| `/l <INF file path>` | Specifies the location of the INF file. |
| `/c <component class>` | Specifies the class of the component to be installed. Valid values are `p` for protocol, `s` for service, and `c` for client. |
| `/i <component ID>` | Specifies the component ID. |
| `/s <type>` | Shows the type of components. Use `\ta` for adapters or `n` for net components. |
| `/b <path name>` | Displays the binding paths, followed by a string containing the name of the path. |
| `/q <component ID>` | Queries whether the specified component ID is installed. |
| `/u <component ID>` | Uninstalls the specified component ID. |
| `/m` | Outputs the binding map to `NetworkBindingMap.txt` in the current directory. When used with `/v`, it also displays the binding map to the console. |
| `/d` | Performs a cleanup on all networking devices. This will require a reboot. |
| `/x` | Performs a cleanup on networking devices, skipping those without physical object names. This will require a reboot. |
| `/?` | Displays help at the command prompt. |

**Examples:**

1. **Install a Protocol Using an INF File:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /l c:\oemdir\example.inf /c p /i example
   ```

2. **Install the MS_Server Service:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /c s /i MS_Server
   ```

3. **Install TCP/IP, NetBIOS, and Microsoft Client for WinPE:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /v /winpe
   ```

4. **Check if Component MS_IPX is Installed:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /q MS_IPX
   ```

5. **Uninstall Component MS_IPX:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /u MS_IPX
   ```

6. **Show All Installed Network Components:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /s n
   ```

7. **Display Binding Paths Containing MS_TCPIP:**
   ```shell
   netcfg /b ms_tcpip
   ```
