User: Okay, so I have python 3.5 on my system (Ubuntu 16.04). Whenever I open a .py file, Idle3 starts, thus pressing F5 will instantly run my code.
However I need python 2.7 now for an assignment. In terminal I've apt-get install idle so, I can open idle and idle3 there easily.
My problem is, I can't change my .py files' default application to idle. It only sees idle3, so I can't open my files with idle(2.7) as default.
Tried to make an alias in ~/.bash_aliases as alias python=/usr/local/bin/python2.7, but typing python --version into terminal I get: 
-bash: /usr/local/bin/python2.7: No such file or directory.
Typing python2 --version and  python3 --version works fine.
Is there any simple workaround for that?
Assistant: Type whereis python2 on your terminal; you end up getting possibly one or more paths to python2. You can then copy-paste any of these paths onto your alias for python in .bash_aliases.
