I currently have Python 3.5 installed on my system (Ubuntu 16.04). Whenever I open a `.py` file, IDLE3 starts, and pressing F5 runs my code immediately. However, I now need to use Python 2.7 for an assignment.

I have installed `idle` using `apt-get install idle`, so I can easily open both `idle` and `idle3` from the terminal. The issue I am facing is that I cannot change the default application for `.py` files to `idle`. The system only recognizes `idle3`, so I cannot set `idle` (which uses Python 2.7) as the default application for opening my Python files.

I tried creating an alias in `~/.bash_aliases` with the command:
```bash
alias python=/usr/local/bin/python2.7
```
However, when I type `python --version` in the terminal, I get the following error:
```
-bash: /usr/local/bin/python2.7: No such file or directory.
```
Interestingly, `python2 --version` and `python3 --version` work fine.

Is there a simple workaround for this issue?

**Solution:**

You can find the correct path to `python2` by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
whereis python2
```
This will return one or more paths to `python2`. You can then use one of these paths to create an alias in your `~/.bash_aliases` file. For example, if the output shows that `python2` is located at `/usr/bin/python2`, you can add the following line to your `~/.bash_aliases`:
```bash
alias python=/usr/bin/python2
```
After adding this alias, reload your bash configuration with:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
This should allow you to use `python` to refer to `python2.7` and resolve the issue with setting `idle` as the default application for `.py` files.
