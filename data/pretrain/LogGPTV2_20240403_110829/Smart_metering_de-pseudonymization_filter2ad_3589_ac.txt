sumption traces across re-pseudonymization he would try to
match two data sets of diﬀerent pseudonyms to determine
whether they belong to the same origin. If we assume that
the re-pseudonymization time frame is constant then the size
of the training set and test set are the same. The potential
eﬀect on the LP attack can be seen in Figure 9.
Even if the re-pseudonymization time frame has only 20
days we can link two pseudonyms of the same identity with
80% accuracy. Thus, for the method to be eﬀective one
would need to re-pseudonymize in very short intervals. There
are two major drawbacks of re-pseudonymization: First,
analysis over frequently re-pseudonymized consumption traces
can only span intervals of the re-pseudonymization time
frame. Analysis by contractors that requires long-term con-
sumption data is not possible because they would need in-
formation about the pseudonymization for that. Second,
frequent re-pseudonymization incurs an overhead of storing
the linking between the diﬀerent pseudonyms and the iden-
tity.
6.3 Privacy-preserving Techniques
Another mitigation technique is the prevention of trans-
mitting and storing consumption traces in the ﬁrst place.

of data that is eﬀectively intelligible by the suppler to one
value per reporting interval. This value represents the price
for the energy consumption of this day. It allows application
of high-resolution time-of-use or real-time prices and can be
used to just report one value per year if desired. This way it
combines the advantages of a very low resolution (one value
per year) and the application of demand response tariﬀs.
It is noteworthy, that the single value per reporting inter-
val does contain a weighting of the energy consumption by
the applicable tariﬀ. Therefore it contains more information
than a single consumption value of similar low-resolution
strategy. However, its applicability is constrained to billing
and cannot be used for forecasting since the tariﬀ skews the
actual consumption.
7. RELATED WORK
Attacks on Smart Metering privacy.
The works [5, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, 20] investigate in the broad
area of consumption trace analysis and behavior analysis
form energy consumption. The authors of [14], for instance,
investigate the eﬀectiveness of their developed behavior de-
duction using a NALM approach. Over the course of two
weeks they conducted an experiment that collected electri-
cal data and video surveillance of the inhabitants. Their
developed system inferred behavior events and load events
from the electrical data and evaluated the performance of
behavior analysis with control data extracted from the video
surveillance. Finally, they construct a sample disclosure
metric that categorizes their behavior deductions into cat-
egories like presence, sleep schedule and others and rates
the disclosure in those categories according to the ability
of their behavior-extraction system. [11] on the other hand
focuses on detecting and characterizing diﬀerent appliances
according to load signatures.
Mitigation by data prevention.
The following approaches are good at ensuring consumer
privacy because no household speciﬁc consumption traces
are stored at the supplier’s and therefore the LA/LP attacks
are not feasible:
In [1] a model for measuring privacy in Smart Metering
is developed and subsequently two diﬀerent solutions to en-
sure privacy are presented: A Trusted Third Party-based
approach, where individual consumption proﬁles are aggre-
gated at the third party and only sums are communicated
to the supplier. The other approach attempts to mask con-
sumption proﬁles by adding randomness to the actual proﬁle
with an expectation of the random distribution of zero.
In [18] another twofold approach is presented: The ﬁrst
solution employs a sophisticated Trusted Platform Module
(TPM) in the Smart Meter to obtain signed tariﬀ data from
the supplier and calculate a trustworthy bill. The second
solution makes use of the electrical grid infrastructure as
a third party to anonymize up-to-date consumption values
sent out constantly by Smart Meters.
In [13] the authors ﬁrst perform an informal threat anal-
ysis of Smart Metering and provide a sketch for an attested
Smart Meter architecture. Using virtualization, mandatory
network access control and trusted computing techniques
this architecture enables multiple applications to use the
Smart Meter hardware and to work in a privacy-preserving
and integer manner. The article identiﬁes applications for
billing the consumer very closely to the data origin (in the
household) and applications that provide the consumer with
a consumer portal. They achieve privacy-preserving Smart
Metering billing by remote attestation of the billing software
in the TPM of the Smart Meter.
A cryptographic approach to Smart Meter privacy has
been presented in [9]. A privacy component homomorphi-
cally calculates the price locally in the household and only

plier. With the help of those proofs the correct calculation
with the correct tariﬀ can be veriﬁed.
In contrast to [21]
this work focuses on how it can be built into existing Smart
Meter reporting protocols.
Another cryptographic approach very similar to [9] is de-
scribed in [21]. It focuses on realizing a variety of diﬀerent
tariﬀ types with a cryptographic solution. Both approaches
have been jointly evaluated in Section 6.3 with respect to
their eﬀectiveness to the developed attacks.
Mitigation by anonymization.
In [3] the authors propose a system to separate the data
ﬂow from the Smart Meter into two ﬂows: One high- and
one low-frequency data ﬂow. The low frequency ﬂow is at-
tributed with the household’s identity and can therefore be
used for billing. The high-frequency data ﬂow, that tells
more about the habits of household inhabitants, is trans-
mitted anonymously by the Smart Meter. An escrow ser-
vice, potentially provided by the manufacturer of the Smart
Meter, authenticates the anonymous high frequency ﬂow to-
wards the utility so that trust can be placed in its authen-
ticity. The escrow service can disclose the identity of the
high-frequency data ﬂow in case of abuse.
This approach anonymizes the high-frequency data ﬂow
but cannot mitigate our attack vectors. Our assumptions
are that attackers have access to anonymous (from their
point of view) consumption traces but still manage to create
linkability using correlation with secondary data sources.
Mitigation by hiding.
In [10] the authors propose to use a ’Load Signature Mod-
erator’ (LSM) and batteries to mask consumption events
that represent ’privacy threats’. The LSM either detects
or is notiﬁed by the appliances of approaching consump-
tion events and could apply different algorithms like hi-
ding, smoothing or obfuscation to hide those events from
the Smart Meter. The batteries serve as energy buﬀer and
enable the smoothing of actual loads. Then the authors
measure the achieved privacy protection using three met-
rics: relative entropy cluster classiﬁcation based similarity
and regression analysis with diﬀerent battery capacities and
their best-eﬀort moderation algorithm.
Our attack vectors would indeed be mitigated by the pro-
posed approach. However, as the authors mention the pro-
posed approach could conﬂict with cost-saving consumption
strategies. On another note, it is questionable whether con-
sumer see that their privacy value oﬀsets the costs of such a
system. If combined with cost-saving strategies, this might
however be a desirable solution for consumers.
8. CONCLUSIONS
We have presented two attack vectors on the unlinkability
of pseudonymized Smart Metering consumption traces. The
ﬁrst attack linking by behavior anomaly attempts to link a
household identity to a pseudonymous consumption trace by
anomaly correlation. The second attack linking by behavior
pattern attempts to trace the origin of a consumption trace
across diﬀerent pseudonyms (due to re-pseudonymization or
due to storage in diﬀerent databases) by using patterns in
their electricity consumption. To demonstrate the impact
of the two attack vectors, we have presented a data anal-
ysis framework which allows us to conduct the attacks in
practice and which we apply to perform experiments on real
consumption traces.
Our experiments indicate that the task of ﬁnding relevant
anomalies in consumption traces for the linking by behav-
ior anomaly is feasible and allows deduction of household
behavior. Regarding the linking by behavior pattern attack
our experiments suggest that tracking the consumption trace
across diﬀerent pseudonyms is also feasible and can be exe-
cuted quite accurately. Finally, we analyzed diﬀerent miti-
gation techniques like lower resolution, frequent re-pseudo-
nymization or data prevention with respect to their ability
to thwart our attacks: A lower Smart Metering resolution
has a mixed/good eﬀect on the LA/LP attacks respectively,
frequent re-pseudonymization requires very frequent (more
often than 20 days) changes of pseudonyms to have notice-
able (less than 80% accuracy) eﬀects on linkability. Data
prevention, by privacy-preserving cryptographic approaches
that calculate the price in the household, has the best eﬀect
on both attacks and is also the most ﬂexible with respect to
high resolution time-of-use and real-time tariﬀs.
We have shown that alleged unlinkability introduced by
pseudonymity of consumption traces is not suﬃcient for con-
sumer privacy. Using the right secondary data sources at-
tackers can link pseudonymized consumption traces back to
consumers or track consumers across diﬀerent databases of
consumption traces. To prevent a failure of Smart Metering
due to consumer distrust solutions must be found, that al-
low legitimate calculations on consumption traces without
endangering consumer privacy.
9. FUTURE WORK
As we lack control data for our linking by behavior anomaly
attack we could not fully evaluate its practical impact. Fu-
ture work in this area is thus the investigation of linkability
with adequate secondary data sources for willing consumers.
Another interesting question is whether persons can be
tracked across diﬀerent residencies. New apartments/houses
induce some change in consumption patterns but to some
extend personal habits and preferences might still be en-
coded in the consumption trace. A research question could
be whether there is a component in the energy consump-
tion pattern that remains the same, i.e. that identiﬁes the
inhabitants even across residencies?
