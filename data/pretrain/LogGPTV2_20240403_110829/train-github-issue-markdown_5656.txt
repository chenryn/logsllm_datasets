Hi,
After our latest vendor upgrade we have experienced a very long execution time
on our CI server. After digging into it I found the following:
Symfony 2.6.5, Win 7 x64, dev mode:
    Total time  755 ms
    Initialization time     480 ms
    composer update symfony/symfony
    //...
    - Removing symfony/symfony (v2.6.5)
    - Installing symfony/symfony (v2.6.8)
(no other vendors were updated)
Symfony 2.6.8, Win 7 x64, dev mode:
    Total time     9622 ms
    Initialization time     9405 ms
  * problem present on linux as well
  * php error log empty
  * dev log seems normal
  * prod mode is unaffected
Any help would be much appreciated.
