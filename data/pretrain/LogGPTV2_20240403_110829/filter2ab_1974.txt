**ATT&CK ID:** T0882  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Theft of Operational Information

Adversaries may steal operational information from a production environment as a direct mission objective, either for personal gain or to inform future operations. This information can include design documents, schedules, rotational data, and other artifacts that provide insights into the organization's operations.

For example, in the Bowman Dam incident, adversaries probed systems to obtain operational data.
