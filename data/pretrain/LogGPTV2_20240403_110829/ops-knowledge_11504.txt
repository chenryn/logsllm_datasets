User: I recently created a python app on openshift. I found a file called app.py.disabled when I git cloned the repo. Can anyone explain what it does?
Assistant: I created a new gear with each cartridge type [python-2.6, python-2.7, python-3.3] and when the code was cloned to my workstation, none of them contained an app.py.disabled file.  Can you give more information about how you created the application?  Did you use a specific quickstart or url?
