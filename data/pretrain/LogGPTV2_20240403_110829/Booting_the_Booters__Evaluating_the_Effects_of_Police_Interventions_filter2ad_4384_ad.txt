of DNS and PORTMAP (and, historically, CHARGEN). We
hypothesise that this is because the ‚ÄòGreat Firewall of China‚Äô
blocks DNS traffic. Attacks targeting the UK appear to be
almost entirely LDAP since mid-2017.
4.3 Self-reported booter dataset
The self-reported attack data is shown in Figure 7. The data
is unlabelled because there are 150 different booters involved,
some of which are still active. We see a generally increas-
ing level of attacks over time, with clear changes following
particular interventions. Booters, especially those of medium
size, tend to be fairly unstable, and the data reflects this,
with outages clearly visible throughout. The effects of these
outages often appear to be ‚Äòabsorbed‚Äô by displacement to
other booters (as seen in March 2018), so the overall attack
numbers remain steady overall.
In Figure 8 we plot the number of booters leaving (‚Äòdeaths‚Äô)
or re-entering (‚Äòresurrections‚Äô) the market each week. The
spikes in new booters (‚Äòbirths‚Äô) are an artefact of the data
collection process (aperiodic searches for new booters) and
we do not analyse those. Most weeks there is little change,
with two exceptions.
Webstresser was taken down in April 2018 (¬ß2.5)2 and we
believe this disrupted a number of smaller booters that had
subcontracted their attacks to it and thus we see a spike in
‚Äòdeaths‚Äô. The attack data shows that the two biggest booters
are largely unaffected (though decreases in their attacks show
that there is some discouragement of users), and after a
couple of weeks new booters begin to appear.
The effects of the Xmas2018 intervention (¬ß2.6) are highly
visible in the data and again there is a spike in ‚Äòdeaths‚Äô. There
is an initial large drop in attack numbers, which builds back
up slightly to a plateau of reduced attack numbers (relative
to the pre-intervention trend), which lasts until March. Prior
2Webstresser did not self-report attack numbers, so is not included
in Figure 7. Analysis of partial attack logs from Webstresser indicate
that it was of a similar size to the largest current booter before it
was taken down. Unfortunately, this data is not comparable with the
self-reported data due to its incompleteness and so is not presented.

to the intervention, the market was distributed between
three major players and numerous smaller providers. The
intervention closes two of the three with the remaining one
maintaining a substantial share (about 60%) of an eventually
recovering market. Some of the smaller booters benefit from
this displacement as well, but not to the same extent.
Immediately after the intervention some short-lived booters
enter the market, then leave after a few weeks. More new
booters start appearing after a month, but with little impact
on the overall total number of attacks, so it appears that
the publicity has dissuaded users from attacking, or they
cannot locate working booters, or a search leads them to visit
one of the domains seized by the FBI and the splash page
has dissuaded them from further action. Growth in attack
numbers does not occur until March when one of the booters
taken down in December returns under a similar name.
Note that following the Xmas2018 intervention, while the
UDP reflection data shows a general flattening of the previ-
ously rising trend, the self-reported data continues to grow
from March 2019 onwards. From our separate qualitative
research on booter communities, we believe that this is a
move away from UDP reflection attacks to using botnets that
send traffic directly, often as Layer 7 (TCP) attacks.
5 RELATED WORK
The closest work to this is the simultaneously published paper
by Kopp et al. which uses IXP and ISP flow data to study
the Xmas2018 intervention by the FBI [29]. They also found
that there was reduction in attacks as a result, but found it
to be smaller, possibly because they only model attacks over
the period Oct 2018 to Jan 2019, thereby ignoring seasonal
effects.
Analysis of booter databases began with Karami and Mc-
Coy‚Äôs analysis of twBooter [27], then Santanna et al. analysed
databases from 15 booters [53]. Karami et al. [28] evaluated
the disruptive effects of PayPal shutting down accounts linked
with booters. They found that despite operators changing
to accept bitcoin payments, the intervention had a negative
effect on revenue. Brunt et al. [7] followed this up by scraping
the vDOS website and analysing its dumped database to
show that only 11% of the customers who had previously paid
by PayPal switched to Bitcoin. However, vDOS probably still
remained profitable until the operators were arrested [30].
The other major strategy for measuring booter attacks is
using UDP honeypots such as the hopscotch [61] or Amp-
Pot [41]. Noroozian et al. [48] used AmpPot and analysed the
victims of DDoS finding that most were on access networks.
In contrast Jonker et al. [25] combined AmpPot data with
UCSD‚Äôs network telescope and found that most DoS attacks
were on web servers. Several research groups have bought
attacks from booters in order to analyse the attacks [29].
Santanna et al. analysed attacks from 14 booters [55]. Krupp
et al. [40] were able to use purchased attacks to link other
attacks to individual booter services with a precision of 99%
and recall of 69% using a ùëò-NN classifier using the set of
honeypots used in the attack, the TTL values, and the victim
port entropy. Krupp et al. [39] used a different approach for
attribution and used selective reply from AmpPot honeypots
to give scanners a fingerprint which enabled them to attribute
58% of attacks to a scanner IP with 99.9% certainty.
Dupont [15] examines attempts to deal with botnets and
identifies three main categories of response: incapacitation,
disruption and harm reduction. More widely, current law
enforcement approaches to online crime focus on disrupting
markets through investigation and high-profile prosecution of

prominent ‚Äòkey players‚Äô, aided by intelligence gathering and
standard policing approaches such as cultivating informants
and infiltration [24].
Criminological studies have analysed the effects of police
crackdowns on online drug markets. These ‚Äòcrackdowns‚Äô are
time-limited intensive law enforcement efforts which aim at
deterrence. The assumption is that increasing the likelihood
and severity of punishment will increase the perceived risk of
operating in these markets. This increased risk should raise
the cost of the end product, reduce consumption, and lead to
the exit of key market players [51]. However, the literature
suggests that the effect of these interventions is limited, with
drug markets showing more resilience than would be expected
if their members‚Äô participation were determined on a purely
calculative, economic basis [12]. In addition to ‚Äòcrackdowns‚Äô,
there are a range of additional law enforcement strategies for
tackling online marketplaces [24], but there is limited data
on the effectiveness of these strategies in practice.
Comparing the effects of different kinds of interventions in
the market for booter services suggests that it is particularly
susceptible to law enforcement action. Criminological work
on other online illicit markets shows that law enforcement
interventions are often limited in their effects. D√©cary-H√©tu‚Äôs

Operation Onymous police action was successful in reducing
numbers of active dealers, and to a smaller extent, consump-
tion of drugs, for around two months but there was no long-
term observable effect on trade in drug cryptomarkets [12].
The impact we see from the Xmas2018 intervention is longer
term and more pronounced. Also, we believe that the struc-
ture of the booter market has been changed with a single
booter now predominating. Research by Ladegaard shows
that, contrary to our findings for booter services, high-profile
sentencing judgements actually appear to increase revenue for
drug cryptomarkets [42]. This accords with a long history of
criminological research which suggests that harsh sentencing
has little deterrent effect on crime [42]. This may indicate
that involvement in the booter market is influenced by rather
different factors than involvement in drug cryptomarkets.
Our use of time series data to evaluate the effects of in-
terventions intended to reduce crime has a long history. For
example, Dugan et al. [14] use this approach to evaluate
the effects of a range of interventions designed to reduce
aeroplane hijackings from 1931 to 2003. They found the
introduction of metal detectors and increased enforcement
significantly reduced hijackings, while tighter baggage and
customer screening did not.
6 DISCUSSION
We are well-aware of flaws in the datasets that we have
used for our analysis. The datasets are incomplete, they
are very noisy and, as shown by the rise in attacks in the
Netherlands when everywhere else was seeing a decrease,
local effects can substantially affect global trends. However
our datasets are large and cover long periods of time and so
despite these limitations we believe they provide a reasonable
approximation to ‚Äòground truth‚Äô about levels of attacks and
the effects which different interventions have on them.
We are also cautious in making claims about cause and
effect. While we have been able to locate interventions or
disruptions which correspond to major drops in the time
series of attacks, they may actually be due to factors of
which we are unaware.
That said, we see that there is consistency between the
type of intervention and the effect it produces both globally
and at a country level. We now discuss this by considering
the different types of intervention and the extent to which
they produce three primary outcomes ‚Äì dissuading providers
(reducing supply), dissuading users (reducing demand), and
producing structural changes to the market.
6.1 High-profile court cases
Media coverage of the prosecution or sentencing of booter
providers appears to have no consistent effect on the num-
ber of attacks we observe. The reporting of the two Mirai
court cases shows a clear and significant reduction in attack
numbers but with a substantial variation between different
countries, presumably because events in foreign countries are
seen as less salient than those closer to home. Additionally,
these took place at a time during which other events were
occuring which may have disrupted the market for booter
services. We argue that this indicates that the reporting of
booter sentences has no consistent negative effect on attacks.
Given that these are not linked to increased shutdowns of
booter services, we argue that any effect we do observe is to
reduce the demand for attacks from users.
6.2 Taking down individual booters
The Webstresser takedown had a deep but short-term effect
on the market for booter services. Webstresser was the biggest
booter at the time of its shutdown, but there was only limited
structural change to the market. A number of smaller booters
disappeared, but they made little contribution to overall
attack totals. There was a short-term drop in attacks by
medium-sized providers, but mainly in mainland Europe and
the US. Although there may have been a deterrent effect, the
reduction may in fact be due to reselling, and Webstresser
may have been providing the actual attack infrastructure
and other booters were merely a shop-front. There was no
lasting effect on the overall trend of attack numbers or the
structure of the market, and the market had recovered to
previous levels after a few weeks.
6.3 Wide-ranging interventions
Compared to the limited effects of the takedown of Web-
stresser, more wide-ranging takedowns had a much longer-
lasting effect effect. The Xmas2018 intervention was by some
margin the most effective, preceding a 10 week decrease of
27% to 37% fewer attacks than would be expected. The shut-
down of the SST section of HackForums led to a shallower
effect, but one which lasted for 13 weeks. We view this as a
form of ‚Äòtakedown‚Äô because it was the closure of a series of
shop-fronts for booters which directly affected how easy it
was to find a booter. It also removed a space for discussions
where users could compare the effectiveness of booters, share
practices and generally reinforce the booter culture.
We believe these wide-ranging takedowns affected the struc-
ture of the market, causing a number of booters to leave the
market permanently, along with a move away from multiple
mid-range providers towards a market dominated by a single
booter. We also see clear evidence of a suppression of user
demand for services, with lower overall numbers of attacks
for a sustained period.
6.4 Targeted messaging campaigns
The NCA‚Äôs search adverts campaign targeting potential
booter users in the UK appears to be correlated with a
striking change in the time series of UK attacks. Where
the other major booter-using nations continue their upward
trend, the UK deviates at this point, flattening throughout
the period of the campaign and only resuming an upward
trend a few months after it has ended. This suggests that
the campaign may have had the effect of dissuading new
users from becoming involved, halting the rising demand
for attacks for a period of seven or eight months. It further
suggests that the rise in attacks (at least in the UK) comes
Booting the Booters: Evaluating the Effects of Police Interventions
IMC‚Äô19, October 21‚Äì23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
from increased demand for these services linked to new users
entering the market, rather than extra activity by existing
booter users.
6.5 Displacement and deterrence
While we can observe displacement to alternative booter
providers when takedowns occur, this is often time-limited
for smaller providers as the influx of users can overwhelm
them (ironically this can be seen as a ‚Äòdenial of service‚Äô) and
lead to their services stopping working effectively.
Although there is much commonality, we observe differ-
ences in the effect sizes of interventions between countries.
These may be language effects in that news fails to spread,
particularly to China. Additionally, Russia and France saw
no significant drop from the Xmas2018 event, suggesting that
their booter communities may have been using a different set
of providers. Conversely, the Webstresser takedown had an
effect across several countries, possibly because the market
was so concentrated around Webstresser. The current con-
centration of the market round a single booter means that
if it were to be taken down then we would expect to see an
international effect.
There is little evidence in the literature of any deterrent
effect of media reporting of sentencing for other kinds of
criminal online activity [42], so our findings for booting merit
further consideration. Equally, although adverts may not
affect the behaviour of those already involved in booting,
the NCA campaign appears to have halted the rise in DoS
attacks in the UK for as long as it was running.
We argue, given previous research on the booter commu-
nity [22], that this we have not observed a ‚Äòclassical‚Äô deterrent
effect where interventions affect the risk calculus of actors
involved in crime. Instead, we believe that the effect is ex-
plained by cultural factors in the booter community, which is
particularly reliant on a widespread, persistent narrative that
booting is not serious crime, involves low levels of harm, and
is effectively legal. The effectiveness of the NCA campaign
implies that this narrative is a key factor for new users enter-
ing the booter market. We therefore argue, on the evidence
from the UK, that messaging campaigns could be a key part
of an effective strategy against booting.
7 CONCLUSIONS
This is the first academic research, of which we are aware,
to study the effects of police interventions on the market for
booter services and it is also one of the first evaluations of
cybercrime interventions more generally.
We have modelled the number of reflected UDP DoS at-
tacks using a negative binomial regression with intervention
components modelled where the series drops below that ex-
pected from the seasonally adjusted, upward trend. We then
linked these drops to widely reported intervention events:
discussion boards closing, shutting down booters and the
sentencing of booter operators.
We have used self-reported data of the number of attacks
carried out by individual booters to determine whether the
impact of interventions has been to cause booters to with-
draw from the market (voluntarily or otherwise) or to affect
the demand for their services. We find some evidence for
displacement ‚Äì when one booter closes there is an uptick in
the attacks performed by others. This does however make
the market more ‚Äòbrittle‚Äô, meaning that the long term im-
pact of the Xmas2018 intervention may make any future
action against the booter which now has 60% of the market
especially disruptive.
The main impact we see is that interventions against boot-
ers can successfully cause a reduction in attack numbers. We
see a strong effect from the targeted messaging of the NCA
search adverts campaign in the UK which appeared to be
particularly effective at keeping new users out of the market.
The most successful interventions appear to be mass take-
downs ‚Äì the Xmas2018 intervention saw the closure of large
numbers of booter sites, and the Hackforums intervention led
to the de-facto closure of several major shopfronts. Both these
interventions made it harder for users to find working booters.
Arrests (and subsequent sentencing) do have an effect, but
it is more short-lived. It is an open question whether arrests
are essential to reinforce the impact of a takedown, although
they should of course prevent the same booter operator just
starting up again the following day.
We argue that there are three mechanisms underlying
the effects we see in our data. Firstly, messaging campaigns
appear to suppress user demand for services by undermining
the widespread perception in the booter community that their
activity is low-harm and essentially legal. A further advantage
of messaging approaches is that they are relatively cheap, do
not pull people into the criminal justice system, and avoid the
criminogenic effects and harms of harsher enforcement action.
Secondly, there appears to be a destabilising effect of website
takedowns, which dissuade booter providers and reduce the
accessibility of these services. Finally, wide-ranging website
takedowns appear to have a structural effect on the market
for booter services, concentrating them around particular
