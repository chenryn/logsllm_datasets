User: In perl debugger I can use DB::get_fork_TTY() to debug both parent and child process in different terminals.  Is there anything similar in python debugger?
Or, is there any good way to debug fork in python?
Assistant: One possible way to debug a fork is to use pdb on the main process and winpdb on the fork. You put a software break early in the fork process and attach the winpdb app once the break has been hit.
It might be possible to run the program under winpdb and attach another instance after the fork - I haven't tried this. You certainly can't attach two winpdb instances at the same time, I've tried and it fails. If it works, this would be preferable - pdb really sucks.
