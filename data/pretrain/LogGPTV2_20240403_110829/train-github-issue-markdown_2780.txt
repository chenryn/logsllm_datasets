Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

In the file `scipy/scipy/stats/_distn_infrastructure.py` at line 2402 in commit `f57e5bf`, the following exception is raised:
```python
raise RuntimeError
```

I encountered this error when running the following code:
```python
scipy.stats.skewnorm.fit([1, 2, np.nan])
```

It would be beneficial to provide a more descriptive error message. For example, "NaNs in data" could be a more informative message. However, I am not certain if there are other scenarios that might trigger this error.

This version clearly describes the issue, provides context, and suggests a more user-friendly error message while acknowledging potential uncertainties.
