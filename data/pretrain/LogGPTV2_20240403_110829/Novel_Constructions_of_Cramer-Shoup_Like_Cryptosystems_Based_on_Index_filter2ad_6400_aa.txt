ABSTRACT
The Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem has attracted much atten-
tion from the research community, mainly due to its eﬃcien-
cy in encryption/decryption, as well as the provable reduc-
tions of security against adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks
in the standard model. At TCC 2005, Vasco et al. proposed
a method for building Cramer-Shoup like cryptosystem over
non-abelian groups and raised an open problem for ﬁnding a
secure instantiation. Based on this work, we present another
general framework for constructing Cramer-Shoup like cryp-
tosystems. We ﬁrstly propose the concept of index exchange-
able family (IEF) and an abstract construction of Cramer-
Shoup like encryption scheme over IEF. The concrete instan-
tiations of IEF are then derived from some reasonable hard-
ness assumptions over abelian groups as well as non-abelian
groups, respectively. These instantiations ultimately lead to
simple yet eﬃcient constructions of Cramer-Shoup like cryp-
tosystems, including new non-abelian analogies that can be
potential solutions to Vasco et al.’s open problem. Moreover,
we propose a secure outsourcing method for the encryption
of the non-abelian analog based on the factorization problem
over non-commutative groups. The experiments clearly indi-
cate that the computational cost of our outsourcing scheme
can be signiﬁcantly reduced thanks to the load sharing with
cloud datacenter servers.

INTRODUCTION
The standard notion of security for public key encryp-
tion (PKE), i.e., indistinguishability against chosen cipher-
text attacks (IND-CCA), was introduced in [17], where the
adversary is allowed to make queries to the decryption or-
acle at any time, while the decryption query on the chal-
lenge ciphertext is not permitted. After then, IND-CCA se-
cure PKE schemes based on non-interactive zero-knowledge
(NIZK) proof of knowledge were proposed [6, 14], which
however are ineﬃcient in both performance and security re-
ductions. In 1993, Zheng and Seberry gave immunizing pub-
lic key cryptosystems against chosen ciphertext attacks [22,
23]. Subsequently, based on Zheng’s method, Bellare and
Rogaway designed IND-CCA secure PKEs in random oracle
models (ROM) [3]. At CRYPTO 1998, Cramer and Shoup
constructed an eﬃcient PKE scheme that is not only prov-
ably IND-CCA secure in the standard model, but also very
eﬃcient in terms of security reductions [4]. Four years lat-
er, Cramer and Shoup [5] further proposed a general frame-
work for building secure PKEs by using the so-called univer-
sal projective hash family which was shown implementable
based on either subset membership problems or language
membership problems from a general class of group theoret-
ic perspectives.
Meanwhile, many cryptographers pay eﬀort to the design
of cryptography based on non-abelian algebraic structures,
such as braid group [11], Thompson group [20], Suzuki 2-
group [13, 12]. At TCC 2005, Vasco et al. presented a
new approach to building Cramer-Shoup like PKEs from
group theoretic perspectives, in which the concept of auto-
morphism group system is used to construct universal pro-
895jective hash families [21]. But they failed in ﬁnding a secure
instantiation based on reasonable non-abelian intractability
assumptions. Recently, Kahrobael and Anshel proposed a
non-abelian construction of Cramer-Shoup like PKE scheme
by using matrices of group ring [10]. However, we ﬁnd that
ciphertexts of their scheme are malleable and thus cannot re-
sistant to adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks. Therefore,
it is interesting to develop a new tool to build Cramer-Shoup
like PKEs based on non-abelian groups.
We ﬁrstly deﬁne the concept of index exchangeable fami-
ly (IEF) and propose IEF’s security requirements for cryp-
tographic applications. Then, based on IEF, an eﬃcient
framework for constructing Cramer-Shoup like encryption
is proposed, and the IND-CCA security reduction is pre-
sented. After that, we give three concrete instantiations of
IEF: the ﬁrst is based on the hardness assumptions of de-
cisional Diﬃe-Hellman problem over ﬁnite ﬁelds, resulting
in the original Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme. The sec-
ond and the third are respectively based on the hardness
assumptions of decisional conjugacy problem and decisional
group factorization problem over certain non-abelian group-
s, contributing to the potential solutions towards Vasco et
al.’s open problem. Furthermore, we propose a secure out-
sourcing technique for the third instantiation, where the en-
cryptor only needs to keep its transformation key that can
be hidden by a random slot. The scheme signiﬁcantly saves
the computational cost by taking advantage of the compu-
tational resource from cloud servers.
2. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we recall some mathematic backgrounds
on computational group theory, mainly focusing on the ma-
terials that are related to our following cryptographic ap-
plications. Considering for resisting all kinds of exhaustive
attacks as well as the well-known birthday attacks, the in-
volved groups are in general assumed to be very large, say
with orders no less than 2160 or sometimes inﬁnite. Thus,
it is impossible to enumerate all elements of the involved
groups.
Instead, we always specify a group G by its pre-
sentations. In particular, for a given, possibly non-abelian,
group G, we use (cid:104)g(cid:105) denotes the cyclic subgroup of G gen-
erated by g ∈ G.
Our main concern is related to the following computation-
al and the decisional problems over non-abelian groups:
• Conjugacy Search Problem (CSP) [11, 10, 15]: Given a
non-abelian group G and two conjugate elements g, h ∈
G, the objective is to ﬁnd g0 ∈ G such that g
−1
0 gg0 = h.
• Group Factorization Problem (GFP) [1, 8, 9]: Given
a non-abelian group G and three elements g, h, g0 ∈ G
with gh (cid:54)= hg, the objective is to ﬁnd g1 ∈ (cid:104)g(cid:105) and
g2 ∈ (cid:104)h(cid:105) such that g1g2 = g0, provided that there is at
least one solution.
The corresponding computational Diﬃe-Hellman like ver-
sions of above problems are given below:
• Computational Diﬃe-Hellman Conjugacy Problem
(CDH-CP): Given a non-abelian group G and a quadru-
ple (g, h, g1 = hxgh−x, g2 = hygh−y) for some un-
known x, y ∈ Z, where gh (cid:54)= hg, the objective is to
compute g3 = hx+ygh−x−y.
• Computational Diﬃe-Hellman Factorization Problem
(CDH-FP): Given a non-abelian group G and a quadru-
ple (g, h, g1 = gx1 hy1 , g2 = gx2 hy2 ) for some unknown
x1, x2, y1, y2 ∈ Z, where gh (cid:54)= hg, the objective is to
compute g3 = gx1+x2 hy1+y2 .
Similarly, the corresponding decisional Diﬃe-Hellman like
versions are given below:
• Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman Conjugacy Problem (DDH-
CP): Given a non-abelian group G and a quintuple
(g, h, g1 = hxgh−x, g2 = hygh−y, g3 = hzgh−z) for
some unknown x, y, z ∈ Z, where gh (cid:54)= hg, the objec-
tive is to decide whether g3 = hx+ygh−x−y or not.
• Decisional Diﬃe-Hellman Factorization Problem (DDH-
FP): Given a non-abelian group G and a quintuple
(g, h, g1 = gx1 hy1 , g2 = gx2 hy2 , g3 = gx3 hy3 ) for some
unknown x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3 ∈ Z, where gh (cid:54)= hg, the
objective is to decide whether g3 = gx1+x2 hy1+y2 or
not.
Apparently, the average hardness relationships among the
above problems are
CSP (cid:22) CDH-CP (cid:22) DDH-CSP
and
GFP (cid:22) CDH-FP (cid:22) DDH-GFP,
where symbol “(cid:22)” means “as least as hard as”. At present, we
do not know whether the CSP (resp. CDH-CP or DDH-CP)
problem is harder or easier than the GFP (resp. CDH-FP
or DDH-FP) problem. On one hand, from the perspective
of computational group theory, there are no known eﬃcient
algorithms, except for exhaustive search, for all above prob-
lems if we regard G as a generic group1. On the other hand,
the non-commutativity of G is necessary for maintaining the
hardness of the CSP, CDH-CP and DDH-CP problems. In
fact according to the analysis presented in [8, 9], we know
that the non-commutativity in the above deﬁnitions plays
core roles in resisting the well-known Shor’s quantum algo-
rithm attacks [19]. As for the GFP, CDH-FP and DDH-FP
problems, although the underlying group G is not required
to be non-abelian, the existing cryptographic constructions
based on these problems also employ the so-called Sandwich
transformation technique [13, 12] that is meaningless if the
underlying group is abelian. Therefore, if without explicit
statement, groups mentioned in this paper are in general
non-abelian.
