“Interoperable Communications Equipment” represents those project funds specifically allocated 
to the Interoperable Communications Equipment solution area subcategory for the procurement 
of interoperable communications equipment. 
“Other Interoperable Communications Funded Activities” are interoperable communications 
project funds allocated to any other subcategory, for example: “Develop and Enhance Plans and 
Protocols” or “Training Course and Program Development, Delivery, or Evaluation”." 
Note: The data contained in this report is directly gathered from information loaded into the Grants Reporting Tool 
(GRT) by users as of 18 April 2006.  GRT data represents the state’s planned project expenditures based on the 
Initial Strategy Implementation Plan (ISIP) and the Bi-annual Strategy Implementation Report (BSIR). It does not 
necessarily represent actual expenditures. Project level data was not collected for FY 2003, as such the figures 
reported for Interoperable Communications Equipment Funding may not represent the entire amount of funding for 
FY 2003. This information is subject to change at any moment per updates added into the GRT by users. Because 
FY 2003 grants were not reported in the GRT, project level data is not available for these grants.
