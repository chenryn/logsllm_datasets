User: I have a ipy script that can be called either from an embedded console in a larger application or directly from the command line and I'm looking for a quick way to determine at run time which has occurred without having to pass an argument to differentiate the events. 
Additionally the script has to run on both mono/linux and .net/windows.
Thanks in advance for any assistance.
Assistant: You could use System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() (assuming you don't use AppDomain isolation, of course) and see if that contains an assembly that would only be preset when your application is running.
