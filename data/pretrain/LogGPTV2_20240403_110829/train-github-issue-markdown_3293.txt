    x, y : array_like, optional
    Values from which to choose. x and y need to have the same shape as condition.
Do they actually need to have the same shape as condition? Also from the docs:
    >>> x = np.arange(9.).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> np.where( x > 5 )
    (array([2, 2, 2]), array([0, 1, 2]))
    >>> x[np.where( x > 3.0 )]               # Note: result is 1D.
    array([ 4.,  5.,  6.,  7.,  8.])
    >>> np.where(x < 5, x, -1)               # Note: broadcasting.
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  2.],
           [ 3.,  4., -1.],
           [-1., -1., -1.]])
