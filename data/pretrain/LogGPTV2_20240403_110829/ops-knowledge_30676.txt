User: I'm trying to get Python support in gVim on Windows. Is there a way to accomplish that?
I'm using:

Windows XP SP3
gVim v. 7.3
Python 2.7.13 (ActivePython through Windows Installer binaries)
Assistant: I encountered this problem on Windows 7 64-bit. I realized I was using 64-bit Python 2.7.3 and 32-bit vim 7.3-46. I reinstalled both as 32-bit versions and then restarted the computer. Now it works.
