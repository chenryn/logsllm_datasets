Question: In the aftermath of the OT:ICEFALL study which revealed that multiple Operational Technology products used default credentials, leading to 'insecure by design' vulnerabilities, you are evaluating various mitigation strategies. What could be the potential implications of continuing to use default passwords in these products, and what strategy would mitigate these implications?
"A": "Potential implication: Uninterrupted service continuity. Mitigation strategy: Implementing a system that locks the account after three unsuccessful login attempts.",
"B": "Potential implication: Easier for attackers to bypass authentication. Mitigation strategy: Forcing the administrator to change the credential upon installation.",
"C": "Potential implication: Enhanced user convenience for initial setup. Mitigation strategy: Enabling two-factor authentication for the default credentials.",
"D": "Potential implication: Improved system performance. Mitigation strategy: Encrypting the default password using a reversible encryption algorithm."
Answer: B
