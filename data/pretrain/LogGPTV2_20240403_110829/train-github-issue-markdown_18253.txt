The `/_cat/indices` endpoint currently supports returning a specific set of headers in its output, including health, status, index name, and shard counts. I propose adding an additional header parameter, `?h=creation_date`, to this endpoint. This enhancement would be particularly useful for sorting and enumerating indices based on their age.
