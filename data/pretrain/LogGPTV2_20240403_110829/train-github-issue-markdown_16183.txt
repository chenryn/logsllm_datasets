There's two parts to this.
  * Add a function to runtime which will generate a json schema for a given API object: http://json-schema.org/
  * Add a function to apiserver that just walks through all registered resources and emits this: http://raml.org/
This will allow us to add a -raml flag to the apiserver binary and get up to
date docs on demand.
