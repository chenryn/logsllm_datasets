User: What is the easiest way to check the existence of a user on a GNU/Linux OS, using Python?
Anything better than issuing ls ~login-name and checking the exit code?
And if running under Windows?
Assistant: I would parse /etc/passwd for the username in question.  Users may not necessarily have homedir's.
