“The SSL Landscape – A Thorough Analysis of the X.509 
PKI Using Active and Passive Measurements” 
Authors: R. Holz, L. Braun, N. Kammenhuber, G. Carle 
Reviewer #1 
Strengths:	 The  paper  examines  some  extensive  data  sets.  It 
compares  and  contrasts  the  information  gleaned  via  active  and 
passive  measurements.  The  paper 
is  (generally  speaking) 
presented in a manner that makes the work appealing to a broad 
audience. The paper is on an important topic, and the results may 
help improve the security of the Internet.  
Weaknesses: In places, the presentation needs improvement (i.e., 
some  sections  seem  like  they  were  written  hastily).  The  paper 
needs  to  more  clearly  distinguish  between  Internet  and  Grid 
certificates. 
Comments to Authors: Abstract: The location of the clients used 
in the active measurements did not.seem to have much effect on 
the  results  (nor  would  I  have  expected  any),  so  I  would  not 
highlight  that  in  the  abstract,  I  would  only  mention  it briefly in 
the methodology section. The abstract should summarize the key 
results, not make vague statements about being able to “perform 
additional analyses” (this is one example where the text seems to 
have been hastily written). 
Introduction:  Negligence  is  not  the  only  possible  reason  for 
problems; malice, blackmail, etc. are some of the others. The fact 
that  “several  measurement  points”  were  used  is  stated/implied 
multiple  times,  but  since  it  really  did  not  have  an  effect  on  the 
results,  I  would  de-emphasize 
to 
describing  the  “remainder  of  the  paper”,  summarize  the  key 
findings of your study. 
Section 2: Provide a diagram of a certificate (i.e., that shows the 
common  information  fields  contained  in  a  certificate).  I  would 
include a “conceptual” diagram of PKI; figure 1 is a bit detailed 
to start off with. Unless you can cite a credible source regarding 
the  source  of  the  CA  attack,  delete  the  statement  “supposedly 
from Iran” (it is not relevant to the issue any way); also, please 
clarify  that  the  attacker  gained  the  signing  authority  of  the  CA. 
Rather  than  just  providing  the  number  of  root  CAs  in  the  root 
store for August 2009 to December 2010, it would be interesting 
to look at much older versions of Netscape/Mozilla, and plot the 
growth. 
Section 3: One paper to add is H. Lee, T. Malkin and E. Nahum, 
“Cryptographic  strength  of  SSL/TLS  servers:  current  and  recent 
practices”, IMC 2007. (if not in this section, than in Section 5.2). 
Clarify that Ristic gave a talk at InfoSec 2011, rather than had a 
paper there  
Section 4: Where will the data be released? Clarify which nmap 
scan was done, and why that type of scan(s) was chosen. Please 
clarify  why  a  new  scanning  tool  was  developed;  Lee  et  al. 
developed one that likely would have provided all of the required 
this.  Immediately  prior 
features  (perhaps  it  is  not  publicly  available),  and  workload 
generation  tools  like  httperf  also  have  the  ability  to  do  what  is 
described  in  this  section.  Please  clarify  how  much  encrypted 
“Internet”  was  on  non-standard  ports  (rather  than  encrypted 
“Grid”  traffic);  was  it  really  worth  trying  to  analyze  all  ports? 
Have  the  Bro  patches  been  shared  with  Bro  developers?  Again, 
multiple client sites are mentioned; but it doesn’t seem like this 
mattered, so why keep mentioning it? 
Section  5:  Create  a  separate  subsection  for  the  discussion  of 
filtering Grid-related certificates (e.g., “5.1 Data Pre-processing”). 
Although the few few paragraphs discuss filtering the Grid-related 
certificates, there is still discussion later in the paper about Grid 
traffic;  this  is  confusing  to  the  reader;  please  either  completely 
filter it from the data set, or skip the discussion of filtering, and 
then  do  a  more  exhaustive  job  of  describing  the  results  for 
“Internet” certificates versus “Grid” certificates. 
Reviewer #2 
Strengths: The Web PKI is a critical component of the Internet, 
timely given the uptick in HTTPS, and as far as I am aware there 
is no comprehensive empirical characterization of it that matches 
this paper. If true that is reason enough to accept it. The results 
themselves  are  perhaps  not  very  surprising  in  retrospect  (lots of 
certificates  are  expired  or  have  other  problems!)  but  there  are 
some  gems  (like  1000  different  certificates  that  have  duplicate 
private  keys!)  and  it  is  valuable  to  see  how  much  minor 
dysfunction is below the surface. 
Weaknesses: Well, it’s a bit of a dry characterization that is not 
surprising for the most part. However, it is still valuable unless it 
has been reported previously. 
Comments  to  Authors:  Thanks  for  an  interesting  read  -  I’ve 
always wondered about certificates.  
Please include your key results / contributions in the abstract and 
introduction.  What  are  they?  For  instance,  near  the  end  of  the 
paper it says “the more popular a site, the more likely it supports 
SSL,  and  the  fewer  the  problems”.  I  did  not  get  this  from  the 
results I read, perhaps because there are so many small results that 
it’s hard to keep the overall thrust together.  
I was confused about self-certs. You describe these as for a host, 
but  I  believe  it  is  common  enough  for  an  organization  like  a 
university to self-cert themselves as a root. Is this true, and can 
you separate this from other “missing root” errors? Basically, it is 
likely not an error for the users.  
Can you tell us for each error what is common browser behavior? 
This would help to put the errors in perspective; I wasn’t sure if 
they would all result in a user alert, or not.  
441The  error  that  surprised  me  most  was  that  mismatches  between 
CN  and  domain  are  very  common.  Surely  this  is  a  significant 
security  problem?  Please  say  more  about  what  it  means  in 
practice.  
Can  you  sketch  a  little  more  of  the  TLS  mechanics  wrt 
certificates? You imply that a server sends the certificate chain on 
SSL connect. I thought it was a multi-step process. 
Reviewer #3 
Strengths:  It’s  good  to  have  quantitative  numbers  on  what 
everyone already suspects: that the x509 system is badly deployed 
and vulnerable. 
Weaknesses: There are no surprises or take-away points from this 
paper that are not already published. 
Comments  to  Authors:  The  main  benefit  of  this  paper  in  my 
mind  is  to  more  completely  quantify  what  people  already  know 
and have previously studied [4,7,9]. That said, it’s not clear to me 
that  a  more  in-depth  study  of  something  that’s  known  to  be 
broken will be of interest to the IMC audience.  
The text in S4.1 makes it sound like you scanned 1M _clients_ on 
port  443;  you  really  scanned  1M  popularly  advertized  web 
servers,  right?  The  “acceptable  use”  clause  in  the  CFP  would 
make  the  former  a  Bad  Thing,  so  you  may  want  to  consider 
making this more clear.  
For this paper to be accepted, I would really like to see a more 
concrete example of the impact on users: are the sites with broken 
certificates  still  being  visited  (and  thus  people  are  just  ignoring 
the “security”) or are these just accidental clicking or probes. One 
thing  that  was  not  clear  was  the  frequency  distribution  of  certs: 
how common are the most common certs and what does that tail 
look like? Are there any very common certs that are broken and 
people keep using them?  
I don’t understand why multiple geographic locations at the same 
time is a benefit for your active probing or why different locations 
have different results: where there really connectivity problems or 
where you exploiting CDN phenomena? Fig 6 seems to show that 
the results were mostly comparable, no?  
Figures 5 (a), 5(b) and 6 should probably be collapsed down to a 
single  “stacked”  bar  graph  for  ease  of  comparison  and  space 
savings.  
I thought that the explanation of the x509 protocol in in S2 was 
something that most people knew and could probably have been 
removed.  
In  general,  I  think  a  lot  could  have  been  done  to  shorten 
descriptions in the paper and make better use of space: maybe this 
points to this data being presented in a short paper format? 
Reviewer #4 
Strengths:  The  authors  processed  very  large  sets  of  collected 
data, a impressive amount of work. The results present an overall 
picture of the x509 certificate deployment, with various pieces of 
interesting results. 
Weaknesses:  The  goal  of  the  paper  seems  a  bit  unclear  to  me. 
After  reading  the  paper  one  ends  with  lots  data  but  a  vague 
picture  of  the  current  stage  of  affairs.  The  paper  started  by 
claiming  that  “it  always  has  been  felt  that  the  certification 
processes of this (x509) PKI may lack in stringency, resulting in a 
deployment where many certificates do not meet the requirements 
of a secure PKI.”, but did not offer a concrete conclusion at the 
end  with  regard  to  that  statement,  i.e.  does/not  the  deployment 
lack stringency? If so, what may be the causes of the problems? 
What need to change? 
Comments  to  Authors:  In  this  paper  the  authors  processed 
impressive  amount  of  collected  data,  and  collected  a  variety  of 
interesting  stats  regarding  the  deployment  of  x509  certificates 
(e.g.  fig-3,  the  decreasing  use  of  MD5;  fig-4,  more  than  100K 
hosts sharing one single certificate?! Fig-5 & fig-6, percentages of 
different errors--but some inconsistency between the figures and 
text, see below).  
High  level  comment:  the  overall  results  seem  just  like  a 
collection, a bit lacking of stringency and focus.  
The paper stated that “we evaluated our datasets with respect to 
the  properties  of  certificates  and  certification  chains,  also 
correlating  this  with  specific  host  properties  (e.  g.  popularity)” 
Maybe  the  paper  could  be  made  stronger  by  first  nailing  down 
exactly  what  kinds  of  “properties”  of  the  certificates  that  the 
paper would want to *focus* on, and for what purpose (e.g. is the 
goal to examine the effectiveness of the certificates in protecting 
the data).  
Without a clearly defined focus, the results look rather diverse.  
Reviewer #5 
Strengths:  The  first  study  of  X.509  Certificates  in  the  wild  for 
the purpose of determining the strength of PKI certification that 
focus on highly ranked domains and performed live monitoring of 
SSL/TLS  to  focus  on  used  certificates,  aiming  at  filtering  out 
invalid  certificates.  The  study  reveals  several  pressing  problems 
of the PKI infrastructure. 
Extensive  implementation  and  setup  to  capture  SSL  flows  at  a 
high  speed  and  to  comprehensively  study  deployed  X.509 
certificates.  The  authors  successfully  combined  multiple  tools 
(TNAPI,  Bro,  SNI,  PlanetLab  etc),  which  requires  a  substantial 
amount of effort. 
Well written paper. Clearly explains the motivation of their study 
and their methodology. 
Interesting  statistics  on  the  types  of  ciphers  and  their  frequency 
used  in  SSL/TLS.  Interesting  statistics  on  how  many  times  the 
same certificate occurs on multiple hosts. 
Interesting statistics on the validity of the certificate chains. Some 
unexpected errors were found. 60% of trust chains were valid. It’s 
good  to  have  quantitative  numbers  on  what  everyone  already 
suspects: that the x509 system is badly deployed and vulnerable. 
Weaknesses: The methodology is quite straight forward and used 
a technique introduced in [13,14,15,16]. No innovative techniques 
were introduced. 
It  would  be  great  if  the  authors  were  able  to  motivate  all  the 
statistics  presented  in  the  paper.  For  example,  knowing  the 
frequency with which ciphers appear in SSL would help us do ...

442Comments  to  Authors:  Overall,  I  enjoyed  reading  the  paper,  I 
learned aspects of the real PKI deployment and obtained several 
statistics  regarding  the  PKI.  The  authors  could  do  a  better  job 
motivating the use of their statistics. It is a good paper. Its main 
weakness 
introducing  any  non-obvious 
measurement techniques. But it is asking good questions and the 
answers the authors obtain are satisfactory.

Response from the Authors 
In the following, we describe the major changes we have made to 
our original submission, as requested by the reviewers. The focus 
of the paper was improved by stating our goals and contributions 
in  the  introduction,  as  well  as  listing  properties  that  we 
concentrate  on.  We  restructured  the  paper  to  improve  the 
storyline:  basically,  we  mimic  the  steps  that  a  client  executes 
while  validating  a  certificate  (errors  in  certificate  chains,  host 
names  etc.).  This  is  followed  by  an  investigation  of  certificate 
properties that impact the security of a SSL/TLS association (e.g., 
hash algorithms and public keys). Finally, we turn to deployment 
issues  and  discuss  the  security  relevance  of  our  findings.  For 
every  certificate  property 
that  we  discuss,  we  added  an 
introductory  explanation  that  describes  the  importance  of  the 
property  in  question,  and  how  a  correct  certificate  should  look 
like in this respect. At several points, we highlight typical client 
behavior when encountering a faulty certificate, in particular bad 
certification  chains  and  self-signed  certificates.  As  requested  by 
the reviewers, we clarified the distinction between Grid and non-
Grid  certificates.  Grid  certificates  are  now  only  discussed  when 
presenting  the  properties  of  SSL/TLS  traffic,  whereas  they  are 
filtered out from the discussion of certificate properties. As was 
proposed,  we  extended  the  discussion  of  data  in  some  sections 
and reduced it in others. For example, we shortened the discussion 
of  certificates  from  different  locations  where  the  results  are  not 
surprising. However, we disagree with the reviewers in the point 
that  globally  distributed  scans  should  not  be  expected  to  show 
differences  in  the  result;  therefore,  we  added  a  section  that 
outlines interesting differences encountered between our scanning 
locations.  Further  discussions  of  issuers  of  the  most  frequent 
certificates or keys affected by the Debian OpenSSL vulnerability 
have  been  added.  The  validity  of  certificates  and  host  names 
contained therein is presented in greater detail, with reference to 
the  effects  in  clients.  We  highlight  that  only  about  18%  of  all 
certificates are actually counted as valid in a client. To make the 
paper  more  accessible,  we  furthermore  updated  the  background 
section  and  added  more  information  about  X.509.  In  light  of 
recent  attacks  on  CAs  (StartCom,  DigiNotar),  we  moreover 
included  descriptions  of  these  attacks.  Last  but  not  least,  we 
would like to thank our anonymous reviewers for their valuable 
feedback, and wish to particularly highlight the work of reviewer 
A.
