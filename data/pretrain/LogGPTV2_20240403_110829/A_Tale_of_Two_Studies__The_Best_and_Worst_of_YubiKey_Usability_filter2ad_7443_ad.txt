### Not Confounding Usability Results
To avoid conflating the results regarding day-to-day usability, it is crucial to distinguish between the setup and ongoing use phases, especially if the experiences in these two phases are as different as they were in our study. While future research should consider the interaction between these phases, such studies are best conducted after a firm understanding of each phase in isolation has been established.

### Need for an Improved Setup Process
Our laboratory study uncovered numerous issues with the setup process for security keys. Comparing the success rates, it is evident that Google's setup experience was superior to both Facebook's and Yubico's Windows 10 software. This difference can be attributed to Google's use of a wizard that guided users through enabling 2FA and setting up their security keys. In contrast, Facebook’s wizard only assisted users in setting up their security key but did not help them enable 2FA on their accounts. YubiKey’s Windows software provided no wizards, instead requiring users to read 17 pages of dense technical documentation. The participants who struggled due to inadequate instructions illustrate Norman’s Gulf of Execution [31]. Prior research [32] has shown that wizards are more effective than written documentation in helping users complete complex tasks. Our results support this, suggesting that a wizard is essential for guiding users through all phases of enabling 2FA and setting up their security keys.

We also observed that after setting up the YubiKey, many users immediately tried to authenticate with it. This served two purposes: to confirm that the setup was successful and to familiarize themselves with the new authentication experience. Unfortunately, none of the services included this component in their wizard or documentation. Testing the YubiKey was further complicated by the fact that Google and Facebook would remember the device after the first authentication attempt, preventing users from re-authenticating. This disconnect between activating the security key and being unable to immediately test it illustrates Norman’s Gulf of Evaluation [31]. In all cases, users would have benefited from a mechanism to test the YubiKey after registering it with the system.

Finally, while individual service providers improving their setup experience would be beneficial, it would still leave a fragmented experience for users. A standardized setup procedure across multiple services would substantially ease the burden of setting up a YubiKey.

### Account Sharing
The longitudinal study revealed that users occasionally share their accounts, such as spouses sharing a Gmail account. This caused difficulties for participants, as it required them to trade off possession of the security key, preventing access to services if the key was lent to another account owner. Additionally, disabled and elderly users often need assistance with their computing tasks [33], and enabling 2FA on their accounts is problematic when this assistance is provided remotely, as it prevents them from manually sharing a 2FA device. A simple solution is to allow more than one 2FA device to be registered with an account. Research could also explore alternative options for supporting account sharing, such as using 2FA for remote authorization instead of authentication.

### Native OS Support for U2F Security Keys
The U2F protocol is not natively supported by any operating system. While operating systems do allow security keys to function as traditional hardware tokens (e.g., smart cards), this removes the benefits of requiring the user to be present to tap the security key’s button before it authenticates. If the security key is left attached to the host device, as is the intended use case for the YubiKey Nano, a remote attacker can exploit the device as if it did not support 2FA at all. This is an unfortunate limitation, as U2F was designed to address these problems. Yubico provided several software solutions for enabling a YubiKey to work with Windows 10, but these solutions had limitations:
- It was easy for users to lock themselves out of their accounts accidentally.
- It was difficult to configure correctly to attain U2F functionality.
- In some configurations, a YubiKey could only be used for session resumption, not initial account login.

While these issues may be addressable through software patches, the preferred solution is for operating systems to fully implement the U2F protocol, ensuring a consistent and usable experience for users.

### Recommendations
Based on the results of our user studies and observations, we recommend the following improvements for U2F security keys and 2FA in general:
1. **Separate Studies for Setup and Day-to-Day Usability:** Research into 2FA should analyze setup and day-to-day usability separately, ideally in separate studies.
2. **Standardize the Setup Process:** The setup process for security keys and 2FA should be standardized across services, providing a uniform experience for users. This process should include wizards that provide active guidance.
3. **Include Clear Indicators of Success:** There should be an easy way to verify that setup was successful. Users must have clear and correct indicators of success or direct access to a trial run of the authentication process.
4. **Consider Shared Accounts:** Users need to share account access, and 2FA systems must support this. At a minimum, all services should allow users to register more than one 2FA device.
5. **Integrate with Operating Systems:** Major operating systems should provide native support for security keys. To prevent unexpected text input, the key should only activate in an authentication context.
6. **Prevent Lockouts:** Users must be made aware of and able to revert failed security key setups. The Windows Logon Authorization Tool should be updated to prevent account lockouts, and YubiKey for Windows Hello should be modified to allow proper U2F-style authentication.

### Conclusion
To explore the usability of U2F security keys for non-enterprise users, we conducted a laboratory and longitudinal study of the YubiKey, a popular line of security keys. Our laboratory study revealed significant challenges in setting up a YubiKey, leading to it being perceived as unusable. In contrast, the longitudinal study examined the day-to-day usability of a YubiKey, revealing that users found it highly usable. These vastly different usability results underscore the importance of separately analyzing both the setup and day-to-day use of 2FA schemes.

During the laboratory study, many participants struggled to set up a YubiKey for Windows 10 and Facebook. In contrast, participants were much more successful with the Google account. The higher success rates for Google indicate that the setup phase can be improved. Participants in the longitudinal study were more positive about the YubiKey, suggesting that if the initial usability hurdle for the setup phase could be overcome, YubiKeys could be a viable 2FA option for non-enterprise users. Additionally, a majority of our longitudinal participants preferred U2F-based 2FA to other forms of 2FA.
