not confound usability results regarding day-to-day usability,
especially if the two usability experiences are as diametrically
opposed as they were in our study. While studies should
eventually consider the interaction of these two phases, such
studies are best performed after building a ﬁrm understanding
of each phase in isolation.
B. Need for an Improved Setup Process
Our laboratory study revealed a multitude of issues with
the setup process for security keys. Comparing the different
success rates, it is clear that Google’s setup experience was
superior to either Facebook’s setup or Yubico’s Windows 10
software. We believe that this largely arises from the fact that
Google used a wizard that walked users through enabling 2FA
and setting up their security keys. In contrast, Facebook’s
wizard only helped users set up their security key, but did not
help them enable 2FA on their accounts. YubiKey’s Windows
software provided no wizards, instead requiring users to read
17 pages of dense technical documentation. The participants
that struggled to complete the setup tasks due to inadequate
instructions illustrate Norman’s Gulf of Execution [31]. As
prior research has shown [32], wizards are more effective than
written documentation at helping users complete otherwise
complicated tasks. In line with this, our results suggest that
a wizard is essential for guiding users through all phases of
enabling 2FA and their security keys.
We also noticed that after setting up the YubiKey, many
users immediately tried to authenticate with it. This served
two purposes: to conﬁrm to the user that they had successfully
set up the YubiKey and to familiarize themselves with the
new authentication experience. Unfortunately, none of the
services included this component of setup in their wizard
or documentation. Testing out the YubiKey was made more
difﬁcult by the fact that Google and Facebook would remember
the device after the ﬁrst authentication attempt, preventing
users from authenticating with the YubiKey. The disconnect
between activating a security key and not being able to
immediately experience how it works illustrates Norman’s Gulf
of Evaluation [31]. In all cases, users would have beneﬁted
from a mechanism for testing out the YubiKey after they had
ﬁnished registering it with the system.
Finally, we note that while it would be beneﬁcial if individual
service providers improved their setup experience, it would still
leave an overall fragmented experience for users. Instead, users
would be well-served by a standardized setup procedure that
would substantially ease the burden of setting up a YubiKey
with multiple services.
C. Account Sharing
The longitudinal study revealed that users occasionally share
their accounts between multiple individuals—for example,
spouses might have a shared Gmail account. This caused
difﬁculty for participants in our study as it required them to
trade off possession of the security key, preventing participants
from accessing services if they had lent the security key
to the other account owner. Also, while not studied in the
paper, we note that disabled and elderly users often have
especially critical needs to allow others to assist them with
their computing tasks [33]. Enabling 2FA on their accounts
is especially problematic when this assistance is provided
remotely, preventing them from manually sharing a 2FA device.
A simple solution to these problems is to allow for more
than one 2FA device to be registered with an account. Research
could also explore alternative options for supporting account
sharing—for example, using 2FA for remote authorization
instead of authentication.
D. Native OS Support for U2F Security Keys
The U2F protocol is not natively supported by any operating
system. Operating systems do allow security keys to function as
traditional hardware tokens (i.e., smart cards), but this removes
the beneﬁts obtained by requiring that the user be present to
tap the security key’s button before it authenticates. In this
mode, if the security key is left attached to the host device,
as is the intended use case for the YubiKey Nano, a remote
attacker will be able to attack the device as if it did not support
2FA at all. This is an unfortunate limitation, as these problems
are well known [21], and U2F was designed to address them.
While Yubico did provide several software solutions for
enabling a YubiKey to work with Windows 10, there were
several
it was easy for users to lock
themselves out of their accounts accidentally. Second, it was
difﬁcult to conﬁgure correctly to attain U2F functionality. Third,
in some conﬁgurations a YubiKey could only be used to log in
at session resumption, not initial account log in. While these
problems may be addressable through software patches, the
preferred solution is for operating systems to fully implement
the U2F protocol, maximizing the chance that users would
have a consistent, usable experience.

IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the results of the user studies and our observations,
we emphasize the following recommendations for improving
U2F security keys and 2FA in general:13
(1) Study setup and day-to-day usability separately.
Research into 2FA should analyze setup and day-to-day
usability separately, ideally exploring them in separate
studies.
(2) Standardize the setup process. The setup process for
security keys, and 2FA in general, should be standardized
across services, providing a uniform experience for users.
This setup process should include wizards that provide
active guidance to users.
(3) Include clear indicators of success. There should be an
easy way to verify that setup was successful. Users must
have clear and correct indicators of success, or direct
access to a trial run of the authentication process.
(4) Consider shared accounts. Users need to share account
access—for example, with a spouse—and 2FA systems
need to support this use case. At a minimum, this means
that all services need to allow users to register more than
one 2FA device.
(5) Integrate with operating systems. Major operating
systems should begin to provide native support for security
keys. To prevent unexpected text input, the key should
only activate in an authentication context.
(6) Prevent lockouts. Users must be made aware of, and be
able to revert, failed security key setup. The Windows
Logon Authorization Tool should be updated to prevent
account lockouts, and YubiKey for Windows Hello should
be modiﬁed to allow proper U2F-style authentication.

longitudinal study of the YubiKey, a popular line of security
keys. Our laboratory study revealed signiﬁcant impediments to
correctly setting up a YubiKey, resulting in it being perceived
as unusable. In contrast, the longitudinal study examined the
day-to-day usability of a YubiKey, revealing that users ﬁnd it
highly usable. The vastly different usability results underscore
the utility and importance of separately analyzing both the
setup and day-to-day use of 2FA schemes.
During the laboratory study, many participants struggled to
set up a YubiKey for Windows 10 and Facebook. In contrast,
participants were much more successful setting up a YubiKey

usability hurdle for the setup phase could be overcome,
YubiKeys could be a viable 2FA option for non-enterprise
users. Additionally, we found that a majority of our longitudinal

Our qualitative data analysis revealed important usability issues
encountered by the participants and served as a basis for our
recommendations.
