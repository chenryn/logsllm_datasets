I'm trying to create an accordion based index that can be displayed as two
columns.
My efforts haven't been successful so far and the best I have managed is
buggy:

(this example may not stay)
The only example I have found that gets it to work is here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14024278/bootstrap-collapse-two-rows
But achieves it by duplicating the ID of the data parent.
Is there a way round this?
