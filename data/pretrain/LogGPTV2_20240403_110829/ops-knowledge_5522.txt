User: python purple says it needs dbms and debhelper in order to run, but I don't run debian. Is there a way to get this running on a different linux? or in cygwin?
Assistant: Both cdbs and debhelper are only needed if you are trying to build a debian package. Just do a regular python setup.py build, and it should work fine (assuming you have the other prerequisites available).
