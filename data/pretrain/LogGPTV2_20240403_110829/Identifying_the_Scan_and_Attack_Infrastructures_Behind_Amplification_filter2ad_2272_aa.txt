## Abstract
Amplification Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks have become a significant threat to internet participants. However, identifying the origins of these attacks is challenging due to the spoofed nature of the traffic. This paper presents novel techniques to uncover the infrastructures behind amplification DDoS attacks. We adopt a two-step approach: first, we develop a method to fingerprint scanners that perform reconnaissance for amplification attacks, allowing us to link subsequent attacks back to the scanner. Our methodology attributes over 58% of attacks to a scanner with a confidence of over 99.9%. Second, we use Time-to-Live (TTL)-based trilateration techniques to map scanners to the actual infrastructures launching the attacks. Using this technique, we identify 34 networks as sources for amplification attacks with 98% certainty.

## 1. Introduction
Amplification DDoS attacks [26] are among the most prevalent and dangerous types of DDoS attacks today. By spoofing the source IP address of requests sent to open internet services (such as DNS or NTP servers), attackers can amplify traffic and disguise their identity. Recent incidents have shown that these attacks can generate bandwidths in the range of several hundred Gbit/s [25, 32]. Not only do they pose a threat in terms of bandwidth, but also in frequency and global scale. During a five-month period in 2015, Kürher et al. monitored over 1.5 million such attacks (approximately 10,000 per day) targeting victims in 192 countries.

Due to the IP-spoofing nature of amplification attacks, the true origin of the attacks remains hidden. This makes it difficult for victims to contact the responsible parties or file legal complaints. Even worse, from the victim's perspective, third-party reflectors may appear to be the attack origin, leading to false attribution. Despite the need for effective mechanisms to trace back the origin of amplification attacks, existing methods are limited. While there are attempts to identify spoofing-enabled networks [4, 21], the coverage of such active probes is limited, and without further evidence of abuse, identified parties feel little social pressure to ban spoofing from their networks (e.g., using BCP38 [24]).

In this work, we aim to attribute amplification attacks back to the infrastructures that cause them. Unlike application-layer DoS attacks, which can be attributed to the origin due to the TCP handshake, finding the source of amplification attacks is inherently more difficult because attackers (i) spoof IP addresses and (ii) use reflectors to diversify traffic sources. IP traceback and similar packet marking schemes have long been proposed to detect the origin of spoofed traffic [31, 11, 36, 41, 15, 12, 14], but none of these designs have been deployed at scale. Tracking the origin of attack traffic remains an ad-hoc process requiring coordination between many ISPs, often resulting in delays of hours or days.

We follow a two-step process to establish an attribution method that identifies the infrastructures used by attackers to prepare and launch amplification attacks. First, we link the reconnaissance and attack phases by tracking which scans for amplifiers result in attacks. We leverage the fact that scans cannot forge their source IP address, allowing us to learn about the scanning infrastructures despite the spoofed attack traffic. Our key idea is to offer each scanner a different set of potential honeypots, encoding a secret identifier to the set of honeypots that any subsequent attack will use, varying per scan source. In the second step, we test if the scan infrastructure is also used to launch the attacks. We use trilateration based on hop counts to link scanners to attack origins.

Our framework provides a practically usable attribution methodology for amplification attacks, fulfilling important goals:
1. Real-time operation: Attribution occurs without noticeable delay.
2. No ISP cooperation required: Solving one of the main practical problems of existing solutions like IP traceback.
3. Probabilistic guarantees: Showing the confidence level of the attribution outcome.

We deployed our methodology on a dataset of 1,351,852 amplification attacks monitored by honeypots over 23 weeks in 2015 and 2016. Our findings show that we can identify the scanners used during the reconnaissance phase of 58% of all attacks. Further analyses reveal that only 20 scanners are responsible for nearly 50% of the attacks. Using our hop-based trilateration process, we find that 22% of the attacks were launched from scan infrastructures, for which we have perfect IP, network, and geographical attribution information.

In summary, our contributions are:
- A novel honeypot-based technique, selective response, that enables us to assign a fingerprint to scanners during the reconnaissance for amplification DDoS attacks and provide confidence guarantees for subsequent attribution.
- Evaluation of our technique on a dataset of 1,531,852 attacks, linking 785,285 back to their corresponding scanner with 99.9% or higher confidence.
- Use of the TTL field of the IPv4 header to compare the location of scanners to the origins of attacks, using data collected by RIPE Atlas probes.
- Finding that for 22% of all attacks, the scanner linked to the attacks is also the source of the attack with 95% confidence.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we define our threat model, discuss the ethical implications, and describe the data used. Section 3 introduces a novel honeypot-based technique to assign identifiers to systems that scan for amplifiers. We evaluate this technique in Section 4. In Section 5, we measure if the infrastructure used to scan for amplifiers is identical to the infrastructure used to launch amplification DDoS attacks. After reviewing our initial assumptions in Section 6 and providing an overview of related work in Section 7, we conclude in Section 8.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Threat Model
This paper focuses on amplification DDoS attacks. The goal of such an attack is to render a system or network unusable by flooding the target's network with a large amount of traffic, leading to network congestion. An attacker leverages amplification vectors in various network protocols, causing Internet-facing servers (such as DNS or NTP) to send many packets towards the target. Our threat model involves at least three parties: the attacker, the victim, and a set of amplifiers.

In an attack, the attacker sends requests with a spoofed IP header to innocent servers (amplifiers). These amplifiers then direct their responses to the victim, hiding the attacker's IP address. Due to amplification vectors in the service implementations, the size of the responses is multiple times larger than the initial request, leading to a bandwidth amplification. Several protocols are known to be amplification-prone [26], with amplification factors ranging from 5 to 4000. Misconfigured systems and support for legacy options lead to a large number of potential amplifiers. Finding these amplifiers is a crucial step in attack reconnaissance, typically performed by scanning. Therefore, we include a fourth party, the scanner, in our threat model.

While attackers could potentially use botnets to launch amplification attacks, previous work has documented that the vast majority of amplification attacks stem from a single origin [20], which aligns with our findings. We assume that attackers use only a single system to launch their attacks. We also assume that scanners do not spoof their source addresses when performing a scan, as no known techniques exist for UDP-based scans.

### 2.2 Ethical Considerations
The datasets used in this paper were collected using AmpPot [20], a honeypot for DDoS amplification. AmpPot emulates a server for vulnerable protocols, becoming one of the amplifiers used in attacks. Deploying such a honeypot poses an ethical challenge: by design, it will act as an amplifier in an actual attack and send unwanted traffic to DDoS victims.

We argue that the contribution of our honeypot to attack traffic is negligible and incurs minimal harm to the victim's system. AmpPot is configured to answer at most three requests per attack, and we deployed it to listen on 48 IPs, with at most 24 sending replies. Therefore, our honeypot will reply to at most 72 packets, totaling a few kilobytes. Given that these attacks typically flood a victim's system with traffic in the order of several Gbit/s, our contribution is negligible.

Additionally, we offered attack victims a method to opt out of our measurements. During our experiments, we received three complaints, which we immediately addressed, but none of the complainers requested to opt out. For a more detailed ethical discussion, see [20].

Finally, note that our non-US legislation and university system does not require IRB approvals, so we did not seek such approval.

## 3. Dataset
Our data was collected using AmpPot [20] by Krämer et al., a honeypot for DDoS amplification attacks. AmpPot emulates a server offering seven UDP-based protocols known to be abused: QOTD, CharGen, DNS, NTP, RIPv1, MSSQL, and SSDP. For incoming packets, AmpPot records all header fields and some protocol-specific information from the packet's payload. To manage the vast amount of traffic, a sampling approach is employed: once a source exceeds 100 packets within one hour, packets from this source are recorded with a probability of 1/100. To minimize harm to DDoS victims, AmpPot stops sending responses after the third packet for sources exceeding one packet per minute. We use the same conservative definition of an attack as Krämer et al., who define an attack as a stream of at least 100 consecutive packets from the same source to the same port without gaps longer than one hour. For more details, see [20].

We leveraged AmpPot in two ways:
1. To attribute attacks to scanners, we extended AmpPot to selectively respond to requests. Each scanner sees a different set of honeypots, which becomes a distinctive feature for attribution. We describe this technique in Section 4. We deployed our modified AmpPot version on November 25th, 2015.
2. The authors of AmpPot granted us access to data collected from 11 honeypots, deployed in late 2014 and operated since then. Combining their datasets with ours allowed us to examine whether scans and attacks were launched from the same infrastructure by comparing TTL values (see Section 6).

Our results are based on data collected between November 25th, 2015, and May 1st, 2016. During this period, our modified AmpPot version observed 1,351,852 attacks, 1,254,102 of which were also recorded by the secondary datasets contributed by the AmpPot authors.

## 4. Selective Response
### 4.1 Intuition
Launching amplification attacks requires prior knowledge of a set of servers that can be abused as amplifiers during the attack. Finding such servers is commonly achieved through scanning, i.e., sending a query to every IP in a certain range and recording which IPs send back a reply. Since scanning the entire IPv4 address space is feasible in a reasonable amount of time even from a single machine [13, 16], we assumed that in most cases, the chosen amplifier set was based on the scan results from a single scan system. We verify this assumption in later analyses.

The main goal of this work is to correlate scan events with amplification attacks. We follow the idea that every scanner will find a different (ideally unique) subset of our deployed honeypots. We influence the scan result by ensuring that each scanner sees a distinct set of honeypots.
