**Title: Black Hat US 2021: Wibbly Wobbly, Timey Wimey â€“ Unveiling the Inner Workings of Apple's U1 Chip**

Apple introduced the Ultra Wideband (UWB) U1 chip with the release of the iPhone 11. This chip provides cryptographically secured spatial measurement capabilities, which have been accessible through the Nearby Interaction framework since iOS 14. Currently, it is limited to interactions with other Apple devices, such as the latest Apple Watch and HomePod mini. These initial steps pave the way for a broader UWB ecosystem, as the ability to measure precise distance and direction can enable a wide range of future applications. The automotive industry, for example, has already announced support for UWB-based mobile car keys on the iPhone.

But what exactly is inside Apple's U1 chip, internally known as "Rose"? In this talk, we will delve into the intricacies of the U1 chip, exploring its time, space, firmware, and kernel components. We will also discuss how to modify firmware interactions from user space, overcoming various challenges along the way. Our exploration will cover not just one or two, but three distinct firmwares that process or forward each Rose time measurement: the Rose Digital Signal Processor (DSP), the Rose Application Processor (AP), and the Always-On Processor (AOP).

By the end of the session, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the U1 chip's architecture and the potential it holds for future innovations.
