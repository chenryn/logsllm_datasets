User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to log a ddos attack on a personal system Say, someone decides to DDOS me. If I'm certain this is happening, how would I go about logging the information done there to submit to the appropriate authorities. As well as who would be the appropriate authorities? IC3? FBI? 
Country: United States

Assistant: If you are suffering a DDoS, there is only one reporting route that has even the slightest chance of helping:


speak to your ISP and see if they are interested. Most aren't.


There is no law enforcement route, as typically a DDoS will be coming from machines in multiple countries all running as part of a BotNet.

You have 3 solutions:


Change IP addresses, so you aren't the target any more. 
Buy more bandwidth so your pipe is bigger than the total bandwidth aimed at you.
Buy the services of a DDoS mitigation provider.
