tack at play, e.g., “my husband’s hobby is to hack my home
network and...track my email, calls, and whereabouts.” The
attacks caused apparent emotional distress to the survivor,
e.g., “I know that my ex-boyfriend is stalking me through my
phone...He has ruined my life.” Another survivor wrote: “I
found out my soon-to-be ex-wife hired a professional hacker
to mess me and my folk’s computers and phones up...just
had a heart attack from the stress.” In six cases, the survivor
described that their abuser “worked at a top IT ﬁrm,” “can
remote access most computers,” or in other terms that indicate
the abuser’s tech-savviness. Even though most attacks in IPV

C: My ex-husband hacked my phone. He keeps getting my account
passwords. I have changed phones so many times and got a
restraining order, but he still managed to do this. Please help.
S: Thank you for contacting us. I’m happy to help resolve the
issue. I would recommend installing [product], which should
prevent malware from being installed if you get a new phone.
C: I have already spent a lot of money trying to ﬁx this problem
and talked to my phone provider. No one has been able to ﬁx
it. I can’t spend more time and effort on this. Please help, this
problem has almost driven me to commit suicide.
S: Please do not worry about these devices if you have [product]
installed. We will do everything we can to help you further.
C: My husband is violent and keeps
hacking my email and watching
everything I do online. Could you
help me get him off my network?
S: I’m sorry to hear what you are go-
ing through. How do you think he
is watching your activity?
C: He doesn’t live with me anymore,
but he broke into my apartment
last month and I think he hacked
my router. I am afraid he can see
everything I am doing.
C: My ex used to share my computer and
installed some programs, but I think she
installed spyware. I think she is remotely
accessing my computer. Can you help?

are technologically unsophisticated [28], survivors in these
cases expressed being scared and helpless especially when
their own computing skills were limited.
Support agents focused on technical issues. Our thematic
analysis of chat transcripts revealed that support agents were
not well prepared for these tech-enabled IPV cases. Figure 1
shows three representative agent-customer interactions. A
typical agent reaction was to scan the survivor’s device for
malicious apps and launch a remote assistance session to
investigate further if needed. Agents might also receive out-
of-scope requests, as one survivor asked “I am blocking my
wife’s/future ex-wife’s messages. Is there any way I can have
these sent to my email for presentation to my attorney?” In
these cases, the agent would refer the survivor to more experi-
enced experts on the team, device manufacturers, or operating
system vendors. For survivors who described traumatic at-
tacks, agents generally expressed conﬁdence in resolving the
technical issue but rarely used empathetic language. When
survivors suspected hacking or spyware, agents typically reas-
sured that the company’s security product would protect them
well. Such claims might not be valid, as there were cases in
which the survivor expressed skepticism or mentioned having
contacted customer support multiple times.
4 Focus Groups with IPV Professionals
Our analysis of customer support cases indicates that agents
receive help requests from IPV survivors but may not be suf-
ﬁciently prepared to handle them. To explore how to improve
customer support to better serve survivors’ needs, we sought
input from IPV professionals who have extensive training
and experience working with survivors. We conducted ﬁve
focus groups with 17 IPV professionals between November
2019 and February 2020. We chose focus groups over 1:1
interviews so that participants could listen to each other and
collectively discuss ideas. Our study was IRB-approved.
4.1 Method
Recruitment. Our 17 participants came from ﬁve organiza-
tions that provide free and conﬁdential civil, legal, counseling,
and support services for IPV survivors in two US cities. We
explained our study to each organization’s director, who then
advertised our study to their staff and assisted with recruitment
and scheduling. Most participants identiﬁed as women and
worked as directors/managers or attorneys/paralegals, with
diverse years of experience in this ﬁeld (see Table 1). Partici-
pants from G4 primarily served human trafﬁcking survivors,
but noted that many of their clients experienced sex trafﬁcking
by intimate partners.
Study protocol. We conducted in-person focus groups at
participants’ organizations. Sessions lasted one hour on aver-
age and were audio-recorded with participants’ consent. We
did not compensate participants as the organization directors
did not deem it necessary. We prepared a list of prompts to
guide the discussion (see Appendix A) and encouraged partic-
ipants to comment or ask questions at any time. We also used
prompts such as “Does anyone else want to chime in?” or
“Are there other points of view?” to elicit diverse perspectives
and encourage participants to respond to one another.
We started by asking about participants’ experience work-
ing with IPV survivors, especially regarding tech-enabled
abuse. Next, we presented the three scenarios in Figure 1,
which represented common attack types in Section 3 and
reﬂected explicit threats from an intimate partner. After par-
ticipants read the scenarios, we asked them to share their
perspectives and recommendations for support agents’ role in
providing advice, making referrals, and more. We also probed
participants to consider adversarial situations in which the
abuser might monitor the chat or impersonate the survivor.
Qualitative data analysis. We used inductive coding [65]
to analyze focus group transcripts. Two researchers indepen-
dently reviewed and coded the ﬁrst three transcripts before
discussing discrepancies. After agreeing on a consistent code-
book, they applied it independently to the remaining tran-

scripts and added new codes that emerged. They then jointly
reviewed all coded transcripts, reconciled disagreements, and
clustered codes into themes. Our ﬁnal codebook (see Ap-
pendix C.1) has 60 codes, covering topics such as advice to
customer support, challenges of customer support, and ad-
versarial scenarios that may involve the abuser. We do not
report inter-rater reliability since all data was double-coded
and disagreements were reconciled [54].
Next, we discuss IPV professionals’ suggestions for how
computer security customer support should handle tech-
enabled IPV cases in three parts: interactions with sur-
vivors (Section 4.2), responsibilities of customer support (Sec-
tion 4.3), and external referrals (Section 4.4).
While we mention how many groups a topic came up in, we
do not include frequencies of themes following recommended
practices of reporting focus group data [42]. Frequency cannot
reliably indicate importance — some people may comment
multiple times on one issue whereas others may not comment
at all [42]. Our ﬁndings are also qualitative in nature and based
on a small sample size. Frequencies could be misleading when
taken out of context and projected onto a population [42].
4.2 Suggestions for Interacting with Survivors
IPV professionals provided three key recommendations for
interacting with customers who might be IPV survivors: us-
ing trauma-informed language, asking follow-up questions
without judging, and avoiding overpromising.
Use trauma-informed language.
IPV professionals reacted
strongly to the language support agents used to respond to sur-
vivors’ concerns. Four groups said that Scenario A included
dismissive language that might mislead or re-traumatize the
survivor. Professionals took issue with the phrase “please do
not worry about these devices if you have [product] installed,”
noting that it is highly inappropriate to focus on the security
software’s functionality right after the survivor mentioned a
restraining order on their abuser and suicidal thoughts. An
attorney discussed how the agent’s language might arise from
the goal of making customers happy in their regular work:
“I understand that the role of customer support is to make
their customer feel better. But this is just a space where
. . . they have a limited capacity to make [the survivor] feel
better . . . I think the goal should be to hear and be honest
about the limitations of what [product] can or cannot do
in those moments.” (P11, attorney)
All groups highlighted the importance of trauma-informed
language, a common element in their own training and prac-
tices [58, 59, 66] and in other ﬁelds serving trauma sur-
vivors [1, 52, 62]. Being trauma-informed means account-
ing for the pervasive nature of trauma and avoiding uninten-
tional re-traumatization through careful language and inter-
actions [23]. A counselor explained how to provide trauma-
informed responses in customer support:
“Acknowledge that ‘this is scary’ and that ‘it sounds like
you’re having a really hard time.’ Even just the small-
est little pieces of empathetic language so [the survivor]
knows that [the agent] is actually hearing them . . . and
expressing concern for them.” (P2, counselor)
Professionals provided suggestions for training support
agents to use trauma-informed language, such as using the
Forensic Experiential Trauma Interview (FETI) [12], which
is aimed at law enforcement but makes analogies for people
who do not typically work with survivors. Another suggestion
was incorporating trauma-informed responses into scripts,
so agents do not need to ﬁgure out what to say on the ﬂy.
Nonetheless, scripts alone were considered insufﬁcient: part
of the training should be educating agents about the complex-
ities of IPV and why trauma-informed responses are needed.
One group highlighted the need to address support agents’
own trauma. Due to the prevalence of IPV [8, 78, 79], some
agents may be survivors themselves. Agents may also feel
distressed and helpless hearing survivors’ experiences:
“Some of these calls will be harmful to the people who
receive them. They’ll be really traumatized by these expe-
riences . . . Any company that’s recognizing their frontline
employees are experiencing these phone calls needs to
think about how to support employees through secondary
trauma issues and process it.” (P13, legal advocate)
Ask follow-up questions without judgment. Four groups
suggested that agents could ask follow-up questions to surface
