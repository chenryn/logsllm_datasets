### Technologically-Enabled Intimate Partner Violence: Insights and Recommendations

#### Introduction
Technologically-enabled intimate partner violence (IPV) is a growing concern, with abusers using various digital means to harass, monitor, and control their victims. This paper examines the experiences of survivors and the responses of customer support agents, highlighting the need for more empathetic and trauma-informed approaches.

#### Survivor Experiences
Survivors often face sophisticated and distressing forms of abuse, such as hacking, surveillance, and remote access to personal devices. For example, one survivor reported, "My husband’s hobby is to hack my home network and...track my email, calls, and whereabouts." Another survivor stated, "I know that my ex-boyfriend is stalking me through my phone...He has ruined my life." In another case, a survivor mentioned, "I found out my soon-to-be ex-wife hired a professional hacker to mess with me and my family's computers and phones...I just had a heart attack from the stress."

In several instances, survivors described their abusers as highly tech-savvy, working at top IT firms or having the ability to remotely access most computers. Despite the technological sophistication of these attacks, many survivors expressed feelings of helplessness and fear, especially when their own computing skills were limited.

#### Customer Support Interactions
Customer support agents often focus on technical issues but may not be well-prepared to handle the emotional and psychological aspects of tech-enabled IPV. Figure 1 illustrates three representative interactions between survivors and support agents:

**Scenario A:**
- **C:** My ex-husband hacked my phone. He keeps getting my account passwords. I have changed phones so many times and got a restraining order, but he still managed to do this. Please help.
- **S:** Thank you for contacting us. I’m happy to help resolve the issue. I would recommend installing [product], which should prevent malware from being installed if you get a new phone.
- **C:** I have already spent a lot of money trying to fix this problem and talked to my phone provider. No one has been able to fix it. I can’t spend more time and effort on this. Please help, this problem has almost driven me to commit suicide.
- **S:** Please do not worry about these devices if you have [product] installed. We will do everything we can to help you further.

**Scenario B:**
- **C:** My husband is violent and keeps hacking my email and watching everything I do online. Could you help me get him off my network?
- **S:** I’m sorry to hear what you are going through. How do you think he is watching your activity?
- **C:** He doesn’t live with me anymore, but he broke into my apartment last month and I think he hacked my router. I am afraid he can see everything I am doing.

**Scenario C:**
- **C:** My ex used to share my computer and installed some programs, but I think she installed spyware. I think she is remotely accessing my computer. Can you help?
- **S:** Thank you for contacting [company name], I will be happy to assist you. Let’s set up a remote connection so I can scan your device for malware. Please visit this link: [link].
- **C:** I can’t open it. My computer just restarted. I think she is monitoring this chat and trying to stop me from getting help.

These interactions reveal that while support agents attempt to address technical issues, they often lack the necessary training to provide empathetic and trauma-informed responses. Agents may also receive out-of-scope requests, such as one survivor asking, "I am blocking my wife’s/future ex-wife’s messages. Is there any way I can have these sent to my email for presentation to my attorney?" In such cases, agents typically refer the survivor to more experienced experts, device manufacturers, or operating system vendors.

#### Focus Groups with IPV Professionals
To better understand how to improve customer support for IPV survivors, we conducted five focus groups with 17 IPV professionals between November 2019 and February 2020. These professionals, who have extensive experience in providing civil, legal, counseling, and support services, offered valuable insights.

##### Method
- **Recruitment:** Participants came from five organizations in two US cities, primarily serving IPV survivors. Most participants identified as women and held roles such as directors, managers, attorneys, and paralegals.
- **Study Protocol:** In-person focus groups lasted approximately one hour and were audio-recorded with consent. We used prompts to guide discussions and encouraged diverse perspectives.
- **Qualitative Data Analysis:** We used inductive coding to analyze transcripts, developing a codebook with 60 codes covering topics such as advice for customer support, challenges, and adversarial scenarios.

##### Suggestions for Interacting with Survivors
IPV professionals provided key recommendations for interacting with IPV survivors:
1. **Use Trauma-Informed Language:**
   - Professionals emphasized the importance of avoiding dismissive language and focusing on empathy. For example, the phrase "please do not worry about these devices if you have [product] installed" was seen as inappropriate, given the survivor's mention of a restraining order and suicidal thoughts.
   - Training should include trauma-informed responses, such as acknowledging the survivor's fears and expressing concern.

2. **Ask Follow-Up Questions Without Judgment:**
   - Agents should ask follow-up questions to gather more information without making the survivor feel judged. This helps in understanding the full scope of the issue and providing appropriate support.

3. **Avoid Overpromising:**
   - Agents should be honest about the limitations of their products and services, avoiding overpromises that may lead to further disappointment and distress.

#### Conclusion
Improving customer support for IPV survivors requires a multifaceted approach, including the use of trauma-informed language, asking non-judgmental follow-up questions, and setting realistic expectations. By incorporating these practices, customer support can better serve the needs of survivors and provide more effective assistance.
