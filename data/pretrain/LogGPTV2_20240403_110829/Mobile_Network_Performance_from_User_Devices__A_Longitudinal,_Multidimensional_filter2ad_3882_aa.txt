## Abstract
In cellular environments, operators, researchers, and end users often lack visibility into network performance on devices. Improving this visibility is challenging due to the numerous factors that influence performance, including carrier, access technology, signal strength, geographic location, and time. Addressing this issue requires longitudinal, continuous, and large-scale measurements from a diverse set of mobile devices and networks.

This paper provides an initial analysis of cellular network performance using 17 months of data collected from devices worldwide. Our findings indicate significant variance in key performance metrics both within and across carriers. This variance is only partially explained by regional and time-of-day patterns. Additionally, the stability of network performance varies substantially among carriers. We use the dataset to diagnose the causes of observed performance issues and identify additional measurements that will enhance our understanding of mobile network behavior.

## 1. Introduction
Cellular networks are the fastest-growing, most popular, and least understood Internet systems. A major challenge in this environment is capturing a representative view of network performance as experienced by end users. Several factors complicate this, such as different policies enforced by carriers based on traffic types or geographic/social characteristics, device models, mobility, network load, packet size, and MAC-layer scheduling.

To account for these factors, we need pervasive network monitoring that samples a variety of devices across carriers, access technologies, locations, and over time. This study uses data collected from controlled measurement experiments in 144 carriers over 17 months, covering 11 cellular network technologies. We use this data to identify patterns, trends, anomalies, and the evolution of cellular network performance.

Our findings show that characterizing and understanding the performance of today's cellular networks is far from trivial. All carriers exhibit significant variance in end-to-end performance in terms of latency and throughput. While geographic and temporal properties account for some differences, performance is inherently unstable, with some carriers providing more or less predictable performance. We also identify alternative sources of variance, such as routing and signal strength. An important open question is how to design a measurement platform that allows us to understand the reasons behind most observed performance differences.

This paper differs from previous related work in that our study is longitudinal, continuous, and gathered from mobile devices using controlled experiments. In contrast, some related work passively collected network traffic from cellular network infrastructure using one month of data or less, and was limited to a single carrier. Other studies collected network performance data at mobile devices but did not use controlled experiments to capture a continuous view of performance.

## 2. Methodology and Dataset
This paper studies cellular network performance using a broad, longitudinal view of network behavior impacting user-perceived performance. We consider HTTP GET throughput, round-trip time (RTT) latency from ping, and DNS lookup time as end-to-end performance metrics. In addition to gathering raw performance data, we annotate our measurements with path information from traceroute, the identity of the device’s carrier, its cellular network technology, signal strength, location, and timestamp.

We focus on performance from mobile devices to Google, a large and popular content provider. Google is an ideal target for network measurements because it is highly available and well-provisioned, making it easier to isolate network performance to cell networks versus Google’s network. Using these measurements, we identify the performance impact of carrier, network technology, location, and time. To reason about the root cause behind performance changes, we use path information, DNS mappings, and signal strength readings.

Our data is collected by two Android apps, Speedometer and Mobiperf, using a nearly identical codebase. Speedometer is an internal Android app developed by Google and deployed on hundreds of volunteer devices, mainly owned by Google employees. As such, the bulk of our dataset is biased toward locations where Google employees live and work. Speedometer collected the following measurements from October 2011 to February 2013 (17 months):
- 6.6 million ping RTTs to www.google.com (each sample consists of 10 consecutive probes)
- 1.7 million HTTP GETs to measure TCP throughput using a 224KB file hosted on a Google server
- 0.4 million UDP burst samples for measuring packet loss rate
- 0.8 million DNS resolutions of google.com
- 0.8 million traceroutes (without hop RTTs) from 144 carriers and 9 network technologies

The dataset includes approximately 4-5 measurements per minute. Each measurement is annotated with device model, coarse-grained location information (k-anonymized latitude and longitude), timestamp, carrier, and network type. All users consented to participate in the measurement study, and the anonymization process is explained in the dataset’s README file. Due to anonymization, the number of users who participated in data collection is unknown.

We augment the Speedometer dataset with 11 months of data collected by Mobiperf. Mobiperf conducts a superset of measurements in Speedometer and notably adds signal strength information. The number of measurements collected by Mobiperf for each task ranges from 17K (HTTP GET) to 58K (ping RTT test) from 71 carriers. We use Mobiperf data to study the impact of signal strength on measurement results. Table 1 shows the number of measurements collected from the most frequently seen 9 network technologies (ordered by peak speed) for both GSM and CDMA technologies in the combined datasets.

## 3. Data Analysis

### 3.1. Performance across Carriers
This section investigates the performance of five access technologies for several carriers. Our goal is to understand how observed performance matches expectations across access technologies and how variable this performance is across carriers.

In Figure 1, we plot percentile distributions (P5, P25, median, P75, and P95) of the latency and throughput of 9 carriers from Asia, America, Europe, and Australia. These carriers were selected based on their geographic locations and relatively large data sample sizes. One key observation is that performance varies significantly across carriers and access technologies, and the range of values is also relatively large.

For carriers with high latency, we use traceroute data to investigate if the cause is inefficient routes to Google. However, approximately half of the carriers, such as SFR (French Carrier) and Swisscom, have direct peering points with Google, making this unlikely to be the cause of high latency.

For carriers such as AT&T, T-Mobile US, and Airtel (India), we observe high variability in latency. In the following subsections, we investigate whether this is explained by regional differences, time-of-day effects, and/or other factors.

Surprisingly, we do not observe significant latency differences across access technologies for some carriers. For example, the latency of UMTS, HSDPA, and HSPA in Emobile (Ireland), SK Telecom (Korea), and Swisscom are almost equal. Users in these networks may not see noticeable differences in performance for delay-sensitive applications when upgrading to newer technologies.

In Figure 1b, we plot HTTP throughput for downloading a 224KB file from a Google domain. Compared to ping RTT, the difference between the throughput of carriers is relatively smaller, indicating that the high variability in ping RTTs is often amortized over the duration of a transfer.

Note that the throughput for UMTS, HSDPA, and HSPA are almost identical. This occurs because the flow size is not sufficiently large to saturate the link for high-capacity technologies. This indicates a need for better low-cost techniques to estimate available capacity in such networks. However, the figure shows significant performance differences between GPRS/EDGE and other access technologies.

We observe that lower latency is generally correlated with higher HTTP GET throughput, but this depends on the carrier. We quantify this using the correlation coefficient between HTTP throughput and ping RTT for specific carrier and network type. The strongest correlation coefficient observed was for Verizon LTE users with -0.53, and the lowest was -0.01 for T-Mobile HSDPA users, using one-hour buckets.

Having observed significant differences in performance within and between carriers, we now investigate some of the potential factors behind this variability.

### 3.2. Performance across Different Locations
We now investigate the impact of geography on network performance. We focus on...
