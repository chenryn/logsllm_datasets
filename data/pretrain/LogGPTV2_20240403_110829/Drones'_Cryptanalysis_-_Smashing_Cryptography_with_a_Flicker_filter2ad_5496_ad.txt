Listing 2.
Interception and creating bitrate signal script.
The script presented in Listing 2 receives the path to the
PCAP as the argument and creates a bitrate signal by aggre-
gating all of the packets according to an interval parameter.
XVI. APPENDIX - HIDING THE PHYSICAL STIMULUS
EXTENSION
One of the methods that we considered takes advantage of
the limited capturing speed of the human eye (48-60 Hz) by
creating a stimulus that is too brief to be detected by the human
eye. This method is popular in advertising where it is used in
order to affect the viewer’s subconscious using visual cues that
appear so brieﬂy (for just a few milliseconds) that people don’t
perceive them [77], [78]. However, most drones use an FPV
channel that supports 25-30 FPS. Hence, even if a drone’s
optical sensor captures a brief stimulus, the change will be
presented to the drone’s operator in his/her controller for 33-
40 milliseconds, revealing the physical stimulus and thereby
disqualifying this method.
XVII. APPENDIX - CONFUSION MATRICES FROM
CLASSIFYING FPV CHANNEL EXPERIMENT
Table VI presents confusion matrices resulting from the
application of Algorithm 2 with various interception windows
on the following moving IoT devices: drone, smartwatch,
smartphone, and robotic vacuum cleaner.
