> Code should not synchronize on a variable or field of a boxed type (for
> example Integer, Boolean) or of type String since it is likely to contain an
> object that is used throughout the program. For example, Boolean.TRUE holds
> a single instance that will be used in many places throughout the program:
> whenever true is autoboxed or a call to Boolean.valueOf is made with true as
> an argument the same instance of Boolean is returned. It is therefore likely
> that two classes synchronizing on a field of type Boolean will end up
> synchronizing on the same object. This may lead to deadlock or threads being
> blocked unnecessarily.
