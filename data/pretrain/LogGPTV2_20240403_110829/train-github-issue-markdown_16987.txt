- I have also reviewed the FAQ and verified that this issue has not been previously addressed.

### Environment

- **Dubbo Version:** 2.7.6-SNAPSHOT

### Issue Description

In the file `JValidator.java` (located at [this link](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/blob/master/dubbo-filter/dubbo-filter-validation/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/validation/support/jvalidation/JValidator.java#L135)), there is a synchronization block that uses a `String` object as the lock. Specifically, the code snippet is as follows:

```java
synchronized (parameterClassName.intern()) {
    CtClass ctClass = null;
    try {
        // Code logic here
    }
}
```

### Problem

Synchronizing on a `String` or any other boxed type (e.g., `Integer`, `Boolean`) is generally discouraged because these objects can be reused throughout the program. For example, `Boolean.TRUE` holds a single instance that is used in many places. When two classes synchronize on a field of type `Boolean`, they may end up synchronizing on the same object, which can lead to deadlocks or unnecessary blocking of threads.
