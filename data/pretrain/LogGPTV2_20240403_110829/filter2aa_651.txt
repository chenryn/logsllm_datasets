### Introduction
Embedded systems, such as gaming consoles and smartphones, have sufficient hardware capabilities to support the execution and operation of malware. Despite this, there are relatively few publicly disclosed incidents of malware on these devices, leading many to believe they are inherently secure. This presentation aims to highlight the potential for malware on embedded systems, the resulting effects, and possible defenses, using real-world examples.

### Background Knowledge

#### The Piracy Scene in Gaming Consoles and Smartphones
- **Illegal Downloads**: Paid software is often illegally downloaded.
- **Anti-Piracy Measures**: While most embedded devices have anti-piracy measures, these are frequently bypassed.
- **Distribution Channels**: Illegal software is distributed via P2P, torrents, and web storage, making it easily accessible to the public.

#### The Current State of Malware on Embedded Devices
- **Gaming Consoles**:
  - **Homebrew Disguise**: Malware disguises itself as useful homebrew applications.
  - **Essential Tools**: Malware masquerades as essential bypassing tools or cracks, causing significant damage upon installation.
- **Smartphones**:
  - **Jailbroken iPhones**: Worms targeting jailbroken iPhones using default passwords.
  - **Traditional Techniques**: Incorporation of traditional malware techniques in Windows Mobile and Blackberry.
  - **Social Engineering**: Worms that collect phone information on Symbian smartphones.
  - **Trojaned Games**: Trojaned Windows Mobile games.
  - **Rootkits**: Toaster Rootkit and Android Rootkit.

#### The Mindset of the General Public
- **User Trust**: Users often do not suspect malware in seemingly normal applications.
- **Lack of Caution**: Many users install downloaded software without thorough checks, only ensuring that the application works.
- **Potential Risks**: These devices can cause similar negative effects as PC malware. With the evolution of hardware, the boundary between embedded devices and PCs is becoming increasingly thin.
- **Network Capabilities**: Recent gaming consoles have network connectivity, providing an ideal environment for malware to thrive.

### The Attacker's Point of View

#### Gaming Consoles as an Attacking Tool
- **Hardware and Development Environment**: Embedded devices have high-quality CPUs, I/O, and network devices. Custom development environments allow users to create legitimate software (homebrew).
- **Hacking with NDS**:
  - **Attacking a PC**: Using NDS to attack and control a PC on the network with a public remote exploit.
  - **Attacking the Network**: Bringing down a network by injecting malicious code into packets.
  - **Injecting Malicious Code**: Modifying network packets to inject malicious code.

#### Malware on Console Gaming Systems
- **Piracy in the Gaming Industry**: The Wii is second only to the PSP in terms of piracy.
- **Game Executables**: Wii games use .dol files, which are stripped-down versions of ELF files.
- **Malware Injection**:
  - **Process**: Merging two .dol files, updating header information, injecting code, and fixing binary issues.
  - **Demo**: Proof-of-concept (POC) of malware injection on Nintendo Wii games.
  - **Live Demos**: Malware in action, including remote host attacks, network downtime, and DNS pharming.

#### Malware Injection on Smartphone Applications
- **iPhone**:
  - **Executables**: Mach-O binaries.
  - **Public Papers**: Numerous papers on MAC viruses are available.
  - **Demo**: Malware attacking a remote host while a game is running.
- **Android**:
  - **Modifying Game Files**: Injecting custom code.
  - **Demo**: Malware causing network downtime while a game is running.

### Defenses

#### Manufacturers: Steps to Take When Designing a New Device
- Implement robust security features.
- Regularly update firmware and software.
- Provide official SDKs and development environments.

#### Security Companies: Software and Policy Measures
- Develop and deploy effective antivirus solutions.
- Implement strict security policies.
- Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

#### Users: Precautions for the General Public
- Be cautious when downloading and installing software.
- Use official app stores and trusted sources.
- Keep devices and software up-to-date.
- Avoid jailbreaking or modifying devices unless absolutely necessary.

### Conclusion
- **Threat Reality**: There is no doubt that malware can run on embedded devices, and some may already be active.
- **Potential Impact**: These malware can be as harmful as those on PCs, so users must be fully aware of their potential.
- **Future Concerns**: Any future embedded device could become a target, so users should remain vigilant and prepared.
