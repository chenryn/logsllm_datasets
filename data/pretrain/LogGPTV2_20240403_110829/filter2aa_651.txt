MALWARE MIGRATING TO 
GAMING CONSOLES
Embedded devices, an AntiVirus-free safe hideout for Malware

About
Introduction
- Embedded systems(gaming consoles, smartphones, etc.) 
have enough hardware for malware to survive and
perform it's job
- There are not so many publicly disclosed issues of 
malware on these devices which make people think 
that they are safe
- The possibilities of malware on embedded systems 
and the resulting effects will be shown in this
presentation with some real world examples, 
along with some possible defenses

About
Background Knowledge
The pirate scene of 
Gamine consoles and Smartphones
Background Knowledge
Payed software being illegally downloaded
- Most embedded devices implement anti pirate 
Measures by some means, but these protections are 
eventually bypassed
Background Knowledge - The pirate scene of Gamine consoles and Smartphones
The distribution of illegal software
- Just like PC software, illegal software is
Being distributed without any restrictions via P2P, 
torrents, web storage
- Easily accessible by the general public
Background Knowledge - The pirate scene of Gamine consoles and Smartphones
The current state of malware on 
embedded devices
Background Knowledge
Malware on Gaming Consoles
- Disguises itself as a useful homebrew application, 
and lures users to install it
- Disguises itself as an essential bypassing tool or 
crack, and upon installation, eventually 
causing havoc or wrecking the device
Background Knowledge - The current state of malware on embedded devices
Malware on Smartphones
- Worm that targets jailbroken iphones using a
default password
- Traditional malware techniques incorporated
in Windows Mobile and Blackberry
- Social Engineering worm that collects phone 
information on Symbian Smartphones
- Trojaned Windows Mobile Games
- Toaster Rootkit
- Android Rootkit
Background Knowledge - The current state of malware on embedded devices
The mindset of the general public
Background Knowledge
User’s thoughts of malware on embedded devices
- Users not being suspicious just by the fact that
that they're using ‘normal’ apps that don’t look 
'fishy'
- Most people do not even give a second
thought before installing downloaded software,
and merely just check that the application works 
Background Knowledge - The mindset of the general public
However...
- These devices are capable of bringing similar 
negative effects of PC malware, and the boundary of 
these devices and the PC is getting very thin due 
to the evolution of hardware 
- Most recent Gaming Consoles contain hardware to 
connect to the network, so an almost ideal 
environment if provided for malware to survive and 
perform it's task.
Background Knowledge - The mindset of the general public
The mindset of an attacker
Gaming Consoles as an
attacking Tool
The attacker's point of view
The hardware and software development environment
- Most embedded devices contain a high quality CPU, 
I/O devices, and network devices
- SDKs not officially provided by the manufacturer,
but users can create legit software that runs on 
the device(via homebrew) with a custom development 
environment

Hacking with NDS
- Attacking and taking control of a PC
- Demo : Using NDS to attack a PC on the network with
a public remote exploit
The attacker's point of view - Gaming console acting like a computer 
Hacking with NDS
- Attacking the network
- Demo : Using NDS to bring down a network
The attacker's point of view - Gaming console acting like a computer 
Hacking with NDS
- Injecting malicious code in network packets
- Demo : Using NDS to inject malicious code by
modifying packets

Malware on Console Gaming systems
The attacker's point of view
Piracy in the gaming industry
2nd place among  
the current gaming 
console systems, 
closely following 
PSP
The inner workings of games running on Wii
- executables files are files with .dol extension
- they are essentially a stripped down version of an 
elf file
- system menu -> apploader -> .dol
- .dol files(and sometimes .rel files) contain all 
code needed for the game to run
The attacker's point of view - Malware injection on existing games 
How custom code can be injected
- Merge 2 dol files
- Update header information
- Inject code that 
transfers execution to 
the game .dol after the 
execution of the 
injected .dol
- Fix a few problematic 
parts in the binary
The attacker's point of view - Malware injection on existing games 
How custom code can be injected
- Demo : POC of malware injection on Nintendo Wii 
games

Malware on Wii
- Demo : Malware(attack remote host) in live 
action while the game is playing
The attacker's point of view - Malware injection on existing games 
- Modifying the game files and injecting 
custom code
- Demo : Malware(network down) in live 
action while the game is playing
Malware on Wii
- Demo : Malware(network down) in live 
action while the game is playing
The attacker's point of view - Malware injection on existing games 
- Modifying the game files and injecting 
custom code
- Demo : Malware(network down) in live 
action while the game is playing
Malware on Wii
- Demo : Malware(attack ap & dns pharming) in live 
action while the game is playing
The attacker's point of view - Malware injection on existing games 
- Modifying the game files and injecting 
custom code
- Demo : Malware(network down) in live 
action while the game is playing
Malware injection on 
Smartphone applications
The attacker's point of view
Malware on iPhone
- Executables are Mach-O binaries
- Lots of malware papers on MAC viruses are public
The attacker's point of view - Malware injected into Smartphone applications 
Malware(attack remote host) in live 
action while the game is playing
Malware on Android
The attacker's point of view - Malware injected into Smartphone applications 
- Modifying the game files and injecting 
custom code
- Demo : Malware(network down) in live

Conclusion
Conclusion
- There are no doubts that malware can run on 
embedded devices, and there may already be some 
running in the wild
- These malware can be equally strong as those on PC, 
so one must be fully aware of their potential
- Not only Gaming Consoles of Smartphones, but any 
other future embedded device may become a target, 
so users should be careful and be prepared
