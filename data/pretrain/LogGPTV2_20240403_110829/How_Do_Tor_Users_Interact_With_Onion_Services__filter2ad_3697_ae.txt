“For less important, high trafﬁc sites (social media like
Facebook), it’s okay. For sites handling much more sensi-
tive/potentially illicit content, its a good idea to make it
difﬁcult to ﬁnd.”
Only 15% did not have an opinion about vanity do-
mains, 8% reported that they disliked vanity onion do-
mains, and 7% did not see a beneﬁt of vanity do-
mains. We asked survey respondents about whether
or not
they memorize vanity domains—speciﬁcally
facebookcorewwwi.onion—and how difﬁcult they ﬁnd it
to memorize onion domains of differing levels of van-
ity. Only 20% of respondents replied that facebook-
corewwwi.onion is among the sites that they have mem-
orized. This is because it is “easy to memorize” (S391)
and “after seeing [it] many times, I automatically start to
memorize it.”(S94) Depending on the format of the vanity
domain, our survey respondents expressed differing levels
of ease for memorizing them; these results are shown in
Figure 11. Most participants found it easier to memorize
vanity domains with a longer recognizable preﬁx such as
Facebook’s. Interestingly, only 4/517 survey respondents
considered vanity domains economically unfair because
wealthy entities can afford to generate longer preﬁxes
such as Facebook.
Usable links. Ten out of seventeen interviewees saw van-
ity domains as a signiﬁcant usability improvement to the

encourage more trust on behalf of the user, but then again,
maybe make phishing easier too, if phishers are making
vanity domains themselves. Yeah, that seems like it could
go both ways actually.”
5.2.5 Onion sites are hard to verify as authentic
Veriﬁcation techniques. We asked our participants about
verifying the authenticity of an onion site. The majority
of our survey respondents (79%) did want to verify an
onion service as authentic. Figure 12 gives an overview
of the strategies that our respondents employ. Most of the
respondents (64%) copied and pasted onion links from
trusted sources (e.g., friends or another, trusted website)
or used bookmarks when revisiting onion services (52%).
Many survey respondents also veriﬁed the domain in
the browser’s address bar (45%), checked if the corre-
sponding website had a link to its onion site (40%), or
checked that the onion service has a valid HTTPS cer-
tiﬁcate (36%).8 Survey respondents reporting checking
the corresponding regular website for veriﬁcation, ver-
ifying if familiar images were recognized, or checking
for HTTPS (9/517). 8/517 only used links if received
form a trusted resource or trusted member of a commu-
nity or check with their notes (4/517). 5/517 trusted their
perception of a website as veriﬁcation of authenticity or
Tor or the fact that onion sites are self-certiﬁed by design
(3/517) or use the fact that they could log into a site as
veriﬁcation (5/517). Only a few mentioned using multiple
sources to verify authenticity (3/517) and at least 9 survey
respondents said that they did not use onion links at all.
When asked how many characters our survey respon-
dents verify in onion domains, 19% veriﬁed thirteen to six-
teen digits, i.e., (almost) the full domain, while 20% veri-
ﬁed up to nine digits, which is within the realm of brute
force attacks, and 5% veriﬁed between nine to twelve dig-
its. More than half of respondents provided no response
at all (54%).
For those interviewees (7/17) who did attempt to ensure
they were visiting an authentic onion site, we observed
two strategies: relying on someone else to ensure a link
was authentic and trying to work out authenticity using
various techniques on their own. Most interviewees in
the ﬁrst group stated that they rely on word of mouth
for veriﬁcation (5/17), followed by assistance from some-
one else (4/17). P3 explained “[I] let people show me
them. I don’t go there myself.” Two interview partici-
pants relied on resources they already trusted for onion
links, like friends and other communities and two ac-
cessed onion services by ﬁrst visiting their corresponding

CA to verify the applicant’s identity and they are not free.

publicly available websites if they could to verify au-
thenticity. One of the most common approaches in the
second group (3/17) was to check and compare URLs to
see whether they matched to a “clearnet site” (P14), its
unencrypted version on the regular Internet. Furthermore,
two interview participants rely on their own experience,
one on HTTPS certiﬁcates, and another one would lower
the security settings in Tor Browser using the security
slider to check the website more thoroughly:“Sometimes,
it worries me, but before that I access, in Tor, I turn off,
I always. First, I always turn off the Java service and
etcetera, to check the website. I think it’s good, then I will
lower the security level in Tor browser, but mostly, I will
ask anything, maybe, in the Reddit or in the forum—in
my country forum—of what the service [may be].” (P17).
One interviewee believed that just using Tor is veriﬁca-
tion in itself and another participant avoided onion sites
altogether.
Veriﬁcation challenges. Indicative of potential security
issues, 29% of survey respondents stated that they some-
times could not tell the difference between an authentic
service and an impersonation, and 10% never checked a
service’s legitimacy in the ﬁrst place. Survey participants
who selected “Other” (13%) provided a wide variety of
ad-hoc veriﬁcation strategies, further highlighting the im-
portance of being able to verify a site as being the one
that they were trying to reach. For instance, 13 survey
respondents said there is no good way of verifying onion
services or they do not know how to.
We also asked our interview participants how they knew
that the site they went to was the one that they wanted to
visit. Similar to the survey respondents, six interviewees
reported that they did not know how to verify the authen-
ticity on an onion site and they were concerned about
being on an impersonating website because it is easy to
mistype onion domains and onion domains change fre-
quently if an onion service is short-lived or moves. P1
summarized the issue as being inherent to the nature of

that the whole point of onion services? That people can
run anonymous things without being to ﬁnd out who owns
and operates them?” Two interviewees even believed
onion site authentication to be impossible. For this rea-
son, some interviewees also proposed that onion domain
formats without numbers or with a stable patterns of let-
ters and numbers could potentially make sites easier to
reach and verify for authenticity.
5.2.6 Onion lookups suggest typos or phishing
Phishing remains an issue despite onion services’ extra
anonymity and security properties. Past work has docu-
mented phishing onion sites that transparently rewrote Bit-
coin addresses to hijack Bitcoin transactions [19, 23, 38].
Key to this attack is the difﬁculty of telling apart an au-
thentic onion domain from an impersonation. For con-
ventional domains we rely on EV certiﬁcates, browser
protections, search results, and long-lived reputation, but
none of these methods have matured for onion services.
Does the nature of onion services facilitate phishing at-
tacks? If so, what can we do to mitigate the issue?
Most interview participants (9/17) agreed that phish-
ing constitutes a serious risk, one of them explained the
phenomenon this way: “the two approaches I know from
the normal Web still apply here, which is typo-squatting,
registering an onion [domain] that’s only a slight vari-
ation away, or bit-squatting, which is slightly different,
but it involves a single or a few bit ﬂips within an onion
address, so that it looks relatively similar” (P6), while an-
other interview participant presented their solution to this
problem: “If you’re manually typing it in I suppose they
could be a problem, but I primarily cut and paste” (P16).
We evaluated how often lookups to two different onion
domains are extremely similar to one another, which can
shed light on how often an onion domain may be phished,
since it is unlikely for distinct onion services to have
extremely similar strings for onion domains.
To do so, we computed the Jaro-Winkler similarity
metric between each unique pair of correctly formatted
onion domains, which is the edit distance between two
strings that gives more weight to strings with common
preﬁxes. We used this metric because people tend to
check the ﬁrst part of the domain. Values range between
[0,1], where 0 represents completely different strings
and 1 represents matching strings, to each unique do-
main pair. We ﬁnd that 0.007% (8,672) of all unique
domain pairs (119,668,185) have an extremely high sim-
ilarity (> .90); for example, bitfog2jzic5tnh7.onion
and bitfog2y7y2pfv75.onion have a Jaro-Winkler simi-
larity of 0.917.
We ﬁrst analyzed the results of the similarity met-
ric for any well-known vanity domains. We found

Table 3: The Jaro-Winkler similarity score for frequently visited
onion domains in the DNS root dataset.
that Facebook’s onion site (facebookcorewwwi.onion)
has a similarity score of 0.953 with another onion
domain that was looked up facebookizqekmhz.onion,
which only appeared in our dataset twice (in compari-
son to the 101 instances of facebookcorewwwi.onion).
Another
frequently looked up onion domain is
blockchainbdgpzk.onion, which is a popular Bitcoin
wallet; it was extremely similar to blockchatvqztbll.onion
(similarity score 0.949). These cases of similar domains
could be a potential indicator of phishing sites for popular
domains.
We next explored the top 20 most frequently requested
onion domains dataset by checking: whether they are ex-
tremely similar to another onion domain in our dataset,
and whether there is a large difference in frequency of the
two similar domains. Of the top 20 onion domains, 16
had a Jaro-Winkler similarity score > 0.90 with at least
one other onion domain in the data. Table 3 shows the
characteristics of these domains. Many of the domains
in the table under “Onion 1” are associated with either
the WannaCry Ransomware, the Mischa Ransomware,
or the Petya Ransomware. The remaining domains in
that column are real onion domains that returned search
results when used as input to https://ahmia.fi; these
include a Russian Market (hydraruzxpnew4af.onion),
DuckDuckGo (3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion), and The Hid-
den Wiki (zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion).
5.3 Areas for Improvement
When we asked about areas for improvement in the survey
and interviews, participants told us that onion services
could be enhanced technically and performance-wise, and
that privacy and security, educational resources on, and
methods for discovering onion content could be improved.
Technical Improvements. In our open ended question on
improvements to onion services, 43/517 did not provide
USENIX Association
27th USENIX Security Symposium    425
an answer and 36/517 expressed their gratitude for Tor
and Torproject and were satisﬁed with the service overall.
However, many respondents spoke of possible enhance-
ments. The majority of survey respondents (59/517) men-
tioned technical improvements they would like to see for
onion services such as improving support for Javascript,
making onion services available in other browsers, and
having more support for mobile devices. 17/517 wanted
a better user interface and user experience with onion ser-
vices in general. Our interviewees also mentioned various
technical improvements they would like to see in onion
services. Two wanted a secure bookmarking tool and an-
other interviewee wanted CAPTCHAs to be gone (these
are triggered more often with onion services). Only four
talked about wanting to see inﬂuential websites or even
all websites set up corresponding onion sites.
Performance Concerns. At least 48 survey respondents
had performance concerns about onion services. For ex-
ample, one survey user stated, “I would always prefer
the onion site but for video sites like YouTube I would
likely often use the normal site to be able to get a higher
quality stream due to higher bandwidth.” (S435) Three
interview participants similarly raised the “slowness” of
onion services.
Privacy and Security. 34 survey participants expressed
concern about anonymity and security issues and would
like to feel and be safer over the Tor network more gen-
erally. For instance, S70 wrote: ‘I hear a lot of social
media questions from casual or unsophisticated users,
and the single biggest problem is that they don’t have the
