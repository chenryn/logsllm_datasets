### For Less Important, High-Traffic Sites

For less important, high-traffic sites such as social media platforms like Facebook, the use of easily discoverable onion domains is acceptable. However, for sites handling more sensitive or potentially illicit content, it is advisable to make the onion domain more difficult to find.

### Opinions on Vanity Domains

Only 15% of respondents had no opinion on vanity domains, 8% reported disliking them, and 7% did not see any benefit in using them. We also asked survey respondents about their ability to memorize vanity domains, specifically `facebookcorewwwi.onion`, and how challenging they found it to memorize onion domains with varying levels of vanity. Only 20% of respondents indicated that they had memorized `facebookcorewwwi.onion`. This was attributed to it being "easy to memorize" (S391) and "after seeing it many times, I automatically start to memorize it" (S94). The ease of memorization varied depending on the format of the vanity domain, as shown in Figure 11. Most participants found it easier to memorize vanity domains with a longer, recognizable prefix, such as Facebook's. Interestingly, only 4 out of 517 survey respondents considered vanity domains economically unfair because wealthy entities can afford to generate longer prefixes.

### Usability of Links

Out of 17 interviewees, ten saw vanity domains as a significant usability improvement. One interviewee commented, "It seems like it would encourage more trust on behalf of the user, but then again, maybe make phishing easier too, if phishers are making vanity domains themselves. Yeah, that seems like it could go both ways actually."

### Verification of Onion Sites

#### Verification Techniques

We asked participants about verifying the authenticity of an onion site. The majority (79%) wanted to verify an onion service as authentic. Figure 12 provides an overview of the strategies used. Most respondents (64%) copied and pasted onion links from trusted sources (e.g., friends or another trusted website) or used bookmarks when revisiting onion services (52%). Many also verified the domain in the browser’s address bar (45%), checked if the corresponding website had a link to its onion site (40%), or checked for a valid HTTPS certificate (36%). Some respondents (9/517) checked the corresponding regular website for verification, familiar images, or HTTPS. A few (8/517) only used links from trusted resources or community members, while others (5/517) trusted their perception of the website or the fact that onion sites are self-certified by design. Only a few mentioned using multiple sources to verify authenticity (3/517), and at least 9 survey respondents said they did not use onion links at all.

When asked about the number of characters they verify in onion domains, 19% verified thirteen to sixteen digits (almost the full domain), 20% verified up to nine digits, and 5% verified between nine to twelve digits. More than half (54%) provided no response.

#### Strategies for Ensuring Authenticity

Among the interviewees (7/17) who attempted to ensure they were visiting an authentic onion site, two strategies were observed: relying on someone else to ensure a link was authentic and trying to work out authenticity using various techniques. Most in the first group relied on word of mouth (5/17) or assistance from someone else (4/17). P3 explained, "[I] let people show me them. I don’t go there myself." Two participants relied on trusted resources like friends and communities, and two accessed onion services by first visiting their corresponding publicly available websites to verify authenticity.

In the second group, one common approach (3/17) was to check and compare URLs to see if they matched a "clearnet site" (P14). Two participants relied on their own experience, one on HTTPS certificates, and another lowered the security settings in Tor Browser to check the website more thoroughly: "Sometimes, it worries me, but before that I access, in Tor, I turn off, I always. First, I always turn off the Java service and etcetera, to check the website. I think it’s good, then I will lower the security level in Tor browser, but mostly, I will ask anything, maybe, in the Reddit or in the forum—in my country forum—of what the service [may be]." (P17).

One interviewee believed that just using Tor is verification in itself, and another participant avoided onion sites altogether.

#### Verification Challenges

Indicative of potential security issues, 29% of survey respondents stated that they sometimes could not tell the difference between an authentic service and an impersonation, and 10% never checked a service’s legitimacy. Survey participants who selected "Other" (13%) provided a wide variety of ad-hoc verification strategies, highlighting the importance of being able to verify a site as the one they intended to reach. For instance, 13 survey respondents said there is no good way of verifying onion services or they do not know how to.

Similar to the survey respondents, six interviewees reported that they did not know how to verify the authenticity of an onion site and were concerned about being on an impersonating website. P1 summarized the issue: "I wouldn’t know how to do that, no. Isn’t that the whole point of onion services? That people can run anonymous things without being able to find out who owns and operates them?" Two interviewees even believed onion site authentication to be impossible. For this reason, some interviewees proposed that onion domain formats without numbers or with stable patterns of letters and numbers could potentially make sites easier to reach and verify for authenticity.

### Phishing and Typosquatting

Phishing remains an issue despite onion services' extra anonymity and security properties. Past work has documented phishing onion sites that transparently rewrote Bitcoin addresses to hijack transactions. Key to this attack is the difficulty of telling apart an authentic onion domain from an impersonation. For conventional domains, we rely on EV certificates, browser protections, search results, and long-lived reputation, but none of these methods have matured for onion services.

Most interview participants (9/17) agreed that phishing constitutes a serious risk. One explained, "The two approaches I know from the normal Web still apply here, which is typo-squatting, registering an onion [domain] that’s only a slight variation away, or bit-squatting, which is slightly different, but it involves a single or a few bit flips within an onion address, so that it looks relatively similar" (P6). Another presented their solution: "If you’re manually typing it in, I suppose they could be a problem, but I primarily cut and paste" (P16).

We evaluated how often lookups to two different onion domains are extremely similar, which can shed light on how often an onion domain may be phished. We computed the Jaro-Winkler similarity metric between each unique pair of correctly formatted onion domains. We found that 0.007% (8,672) of all unique domain pairs (119,668,185) have an extremely high similarity (> .90). For example, `bitfog2jzic5tnh7.onion` and `bitfog2y7y2pfv75.onion` have a Jaro-Winkler similarity of 0.917.

We analyzed the results for well-known vanity domains. Facebook's onion site (`facebookcorewwwi.onion`) has a similarity score of 0.953 with `facebookizqekmhz.onion`, which appeared only twice in our dataset. Another frequently looked-up onion domain, `blockchainbdgpzk.onion`, a popular Bitcoin wallet, was extremely similar to `blockchatvqztbll.onion` (similarity score 0.949). These cases of similar domains could be potential indicators of phishing sites for popular domains.

### Areas for Improvement

When asked about areas for improvement, participants suggested technical and performance enhancements, as well as improvements in privacy, security, educational resources, and methods for discovering onion content.

#### Technical Improvements

In our open-ended question on improvements to onion services, 43/517 did not provide an answer, and 36/517 expressed gratitude for Tor and were satisfied with the service overall. However, many respondents suggested possible enhancements. The majority (59/517) mentioned technical improvements such as better support for JavaScript, availability in other browsers, and more support for mobile devices. 17/517 wanted a better user interface and user experience. Interviewees also mentioned various technical improvements, such as a secure bookmarking tool and the removal of CAPTCHAs, which are triggered more often with onion services. Only four talked about wanting influential websites or even all websites to set up corresponding onion sites.

#### Performance Concerns

At least 48 survey respondents had performance concerns about onion services. For example, one user stated, "I would always prefer the onion site but for video sites like YouTube, I would likely often use the normal site to get a higher quality stream due to higher bandwidth." (S435) Three interview participants similarly raised the "slowness" of onion services.

#### Privacy and Security

34 survey participants expressed concern about anonymity and security issues and would like to feel and be safer over the Tor network. For instance, S70 wrote, "I hear a lot of social media questions from casual or unsophisticated users, and the single biggest problem is that they don’t have the necessary knowledge to stay safe."
