User: I am using the terminal on a MacBook Pro.
Trying to use intelhex in my code. I have downloaded intelhex using 

sudo pip install intelhex

Success

pip list

shows intelhex installed
run my code and receive this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "./myCode.py", line 20, in 
      from intelhex import IntelHex
  ImportError: No module named 'intelhex'

I am using Python 2.7.11

ls /usr/local/bin

shows the contents of intelhex:
hex2bin.py
bin2hex.py
hexmerge.py
hexdiff.py
Where am I going wrong?!
Assistant: That error means that there is no 'intelhex' on your Python path. The contents of /usr/local/bin should not matter (those are executable files but are not the Python modules). Are you sure that you installed the package and are loading it from the same Python site packages location you installed it to?
