User: I compiled a module.pyx file to module.so under Mac OS X, and now I can use it with:
from module import method1
However, the same .so file won't work on Linux, I have to compile a new module.so under Linux.
So the problem is, how can I write a cross platform(Mac and Linux) module with Cython?
Assistant: You can't. You'll have to compile a different library for each platform you need to support.
