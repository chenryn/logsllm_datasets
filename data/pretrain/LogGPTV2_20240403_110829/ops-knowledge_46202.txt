Question: Review the following pseudocode for a user authentication system and identify the choice(s) that indicate a violation of the 'Economy of Mechanism' principle:

Pseudocode:
function authenticateUser(credentials) {
 // Step 1: Perform complex validation of credentials format
 // Step 2: Use a custom hashing algorithm to obscure credentials
 // Step 3: Compare hashed credentials against a list of hashes stored in multiple distributed databases
 // Step 4: Implement a series of non-standard security checks before granting access
}
"A": "Step 1 demonstrates an adherence to the principle of 'Economy of Mechanism' by ensuring that credentials follow a specific format.",
"B": "Step 2 violates the principle by using a custom, potentially obscure hashing algorithm instead of a well-known and tested one.",
"C": "Step 3 is in line with the principle since it uses multiple databases to enhance security through redundancy.",
"D": "Step 4's use of non-standard security checks introduces unnecessary complexity, which could lead to misunderstandings and vulnerabilities."
Answer: BD
