实在是太无聊了，找了找比赛打，`Codefest2018`这个感觉跟以往的ctf比赛不同，感觉更偏向代码能力的考查，以下是这次自己做出来的题目writeup，比赛题目一共`15`道，菜鸡一枚，只做出`10`道。
## Freebies
### problem
This one’s simple. Join the [Slack
channel](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=https://join.slack.com/t/codefest-ctf-18/shared_invite/enQtNDI2MjY1NDcyNDA2LTdiNTczZWUxMjJkZWUwMmQ5MTIxNzMzNDMwMjU5ZTU5MWFlYzU1MjY0MTE2NWI4ZTEyMWFkMTNlYzg3MTAxMTQ)
to get the flag.
这题算是签到题，但也是寻找了好一番，就不放答案了
## Fortune Cookie
### problem
H4k3r has heard that there is a secret hidden behind this
[website](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=http://34.216.132.109:8084/),
but he is confused as to how to get access to it. Can you help him
这题，呃，很简单，该下cookies(说着简单，最后试了半天才发现是admin，不是Admin)
`Who are you?=admin`即可
## Typing Master
### problem
If you think you have it in you, connect now to 34.216.132.109 9093 and prove
your mettle.
You will be presented with a simple typing task which is meant to check your
typing speed.
For example, _Can you type ‘Z’ 10 times followed by ‘u’ 6 times, followed by
the sum of their ASCII values?_
    ZZZZZZZZZZuuuuuu207
### Input Format
**Regarding input to the server** – The question was designed keeping netcat
in mind. Some users who are using other tools/language (eg, Python, PuTTY,
TELNET) to connect to the server please note that they do not terminate the
strings like netcat does. If you choose not to use netcat, the message you
send to our server should terminate with a trailing newline (‘n’) and nothing
else.
nc下,先看看大概是啥样子的
发现每次访问，要求的都不一样，甚至返回的字符串也不一样，想了想，觉得还是一个脚本的事，需要正则一下即可
脚本如下：
    #-*-coding:utf-8
    from pwn import *
    import re 
    conn=remote('34.216.132.109',9093)
    text=conn.recv()
    print text
    result = re.findall(r"'(w)' (d*)", text)
    #print result
    #print result[0][0]
    #print result[0][1]
    str1=(result[0][0] * int(result[0][1]))
    str2=(result[1][0] * int(result[1][1]))
    str3=(str(ord(result[0][0]) +  ord(result[1][0])))
    S = ''.join(str1+str2+str3)
    print S
    conn.sendline(S)
    print conn.recv()
运行结果
最终答案：`CodefestCTF{1_s33_y0u_4r3_a_m4n_0f_sp33d}`
## Web BooK
### problem
It is expected to complete reading a book/novel to pass the course, but the
students being clever avoid reading the whole book by going through the
summary only. Santosh(their course teacher) comes up with a new idea, he
creates a magic book (you can only go to next page, that is: you can’t go to
next page without reading the previous one and so on, and you can only start
from the beginning). It is know that the flag is hidden somewhere in the book,
so the only way to pass the course is to read the whole book, find the flag.
The book has 1000 pages so better be fast. And if you are lucky, you may even
find the key on the very first page itself. [link to
Web_BooK](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=http://34.216.132.109:8083/fp/)
打开网站，发现如下页面，点击next发现，都是没有规则的url
没办法，只能简单爬虫脚本写下，源码如下
    #-*-coding:utf-8
    import requests
    import re
    url = 'http://34.216.132.109:8083'
    page = '/fp/'
    s = requests.Session()
    counter = 0
    while (True):
        counter += 1
        r = s.get(url + page)
        page_text = r.text
        print page_text
        page = re.findall('action="(.*?)"', page_text)[0]
        print page, counter
运行下
## Access Denied?
### problem
A school IT staff manages access to secure files by the method of access code.
You are required to give your name and the access code, and the program will
give out secret information.
It checks whether you already have an access code, generates new random one
along with a new user ID alloted to the user, if that user is not found
locally on the system. The access codes are known to have random expiration
time (don’t know what goes on in their minds!), so don’t be surprised if you
generated an access code just seconds ago and next time the same access code
doesn’t work.
Johnny decided to go into the IT room and copy the program into his pendrive.
You can find it
[here](https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KGoBbSNViJS8aZsh1Jjp8XbESv0E-Z4t).
Can you get the secret information out from the program? The service runs on
34.216.132.109 on port 9094.
### Constraints
User ID / UID will be a positive integer
这题给了个school.py
    #-*-coding:utf-8
    import random
    import user_functions
    user = raw_input("Enter your name: ")
    if not user_functions.exists(user):
        # generate a code
        count_ = user_functions.generateID(user)%1000    #User ID/ UID in the table is always positive
        generator = "xorshift"
        random.seed(generator)
        count = 0;
        for ch in user:
            ra = random.randint(1, ord(ch))
            rb = (ord(ch) * random.randint(1, len(user))) ^ random.randint(1, ord(ch))
            count += (ra + rb)/2
        code = 1
        for i in range(1,count+count_):
            code = (code + random.randint(1, i) ) % 1000000
        final = random.randint(1,9) * 1000000 + code
        #store it in the database
        user_functions.store(user, final)
    else:
