### Analysis and Observations

The first two phenomena observed confirmed our initial hypotheses regarding the expected behavior of this category of spammers. The most intriguing finding, however, is the confirmation of BGP spectrum agility. This agility manifests as campaigns of BGP hijacks orchestrated by the same spammers, highlighting a more sophisticated and agile modus operandi. These spammers can hijack and abuse multiple IP prefixes, then switch between them to distribute spam. This strategy allows them to operate more covertly, remaining undetected "under the radar."

Additionally, Table II reveals a higher variability in spam email subjects and whois registrant addresses, suggesting a more dynamic and diverse approach to spamming activities.
