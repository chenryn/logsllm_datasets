of time. While the ﬁrst two phenomena actually conﬁrmed
our intuition about the anticipated behavior of this class of
spammers, the latter phenomenon is the most interesting as
it conﬁrms the existence of BGP spectrum agility in the
form of campaigns of BGP hijacks orchestrated by the same
spammers. Indeed, it highlights the existence of a more agile
and sophisticated modus operandi of spammers capable of
hijacking and abusing multiple IP preﬁxes, and subsequently
hopping from one hijacked IP preﬁx to another to distribute
spam. This agility enables them to send spam in a more
stealthy manner and thus stay undetected “under the radar”.
Finally, from Table II we also observe a higher variability
in spam email subjects and whois registrant addresses, sug-
