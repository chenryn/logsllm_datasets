## Description:
> You came across a custom server that Dr Xernon's company eleCTRic Ltd uses. It seems to be storing some encrypted files. Can you get us the flag?

## Solution:
Connecting to the service, we can choose to encrypt, decrypt or list files.
If we start by listing files, we see the flag file is already there:
```

Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: i
Files:
  flag_5747f8d4060b328f0fbc.txt
```
However, in order to decrypt it, we need the encrypted name of the file, which is received only during encryption:
```
Choices:
  E[n]crypt and store file
  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: n
Name of file? test
Data? a
Share code:

Choices:

  D[e]crypt file
  L[i]st files
  E[x]it
Please choose: e
Share code? HzoBdxcjpWM=
Data:
a
```
According to the source code, encryption is performed by AES-CTR:
```python
cipher = AES.new(self.key, AES.MODE_CTR, counter=lambda: self.ctr)
```
However, the counter is implemented as a constant, when in fact it should change for each block (more about this [here](https://ctftime.org/writeup/7199)):
```python
        self.ctr = random.read(AES.block_size)
```
This means that instead of a stream cipher, AES-CTR is being reduced to a block cipher where throughout each session, the nth block of the plaintext will always be encrypted to the same ciphertext. Furthermore, the encrypted nth block of two plaintexts which differ by x bytes will only differ by x bytes as well.
Let's see an example:
