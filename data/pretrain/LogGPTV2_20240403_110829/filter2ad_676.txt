ABSTRACT
A novel steganographc approach analogy to the real-world secret 
communcaton mechansm, n whch secret messages are wrtten 
on  whte  papers  usng  nvsble  nk  lke  lemon  juce  and  are 
revealed only after the papers are heated, s proposed. Carefully-
desgned nformed embedders now play the role of “nvsble nk”; 
some  pre-negotated  attacks  provded  by  common  content-
processng  tools  correspond  to  the  requred  “heatng”  process. 
Theoretc  models  and  feasble  mplementatons  of  the  proposed 
dgtal-nvsble-nk watermarkng approach based on both blnd-
detecton 
spread-spectrum  watermarkng  and  quantzaton 
watermarkng  schemes are  provded.  The  proposed  schemes  can 
prevent  the  supervsor  from  nterpretng  secret  messages  even 
when  the  watermark  extractor  and  decrypton  tool,  as  well  as 
sesson keys, are avalable to the supervsor. Furthermore, secret 
communcaton  systems  employng  the  proposed  scheme  can 
aggressvely mslead the channel supervsor wth fake watermarks 
and transmt genune secrets at the same tme.

1. Models of Digital Invisible Ink 
The  proposed  dgtal-nvsble-nk  watermarkng 
system, 
abbrevated  as  DII  watermarkng,  s  n  fact  one  varant  of  the 
nformed-embeddng  watermarkng  systems  snce  some  pre-
negotated attacks are taken nto consderaton durng watermark 
embeddng. However, the content s not actually attacked before 
or  n  the  transmsson  channel.  Instead,  when  the  ntended 
recever  receves  the  marked  content,  the  pre-negotated  attacks 
are  then  performed  va  commonly  avalable  content  processng 
tools.  Snce  the  pre-negotated  attack  s  appled  after  the 
supervsed  transmsson,  the  qualty  degradaton  caused  by  the 
attacks can volate the fdelty constrant that most watermarkng 
schemes obey.  
In  DII  watermarkng  scheme,  the  exstence  of  pre-negotated 
attack  noses  s  necessary  for  the  successful  detecton  of  the 
hdden  payload.  Both  DII  models  of  blnd-detecton  spread-
spectrum  watermarkng  and  quantzaton  watermarkng  schemes 
are nvestgated.

In  the  case  of  blnd-detecton  watermarkng  schemes,  the  angle 
between  the  nose  caused  by  pre-negotated  attack  and  the 
pseudo-random watermark vector must be wthn the range of [-
0o, 0o]. Furthermore, the magntude of the projecton of the pre-
negotated  attack  nose  n  the  drecton  of  the  watermark  vector 
must  be  larger  than  the  guaranteed  amount  over  the  detecton 
threshold.  The  frst  condton  s  naturally  satsfed  due  to  the 
pseudo-randomness  of  spread-spectrum  watermark  vectors  and 
the  second  condton  s  acheved  by  an  teratve  nformed-
embeddng methodology n whch scale factors of watermarks are 
adequately adjusted.  
As for  quantzaton  watermarkng, the  orgnal  cover  work  must 
be quantzed to be wthn  the quantzaton cell  correspondng  to 
the  wrong  reconstructon pont frst, and  then  the  pre-negotated 
attack should dstort the marked work along the drecton from the 
wrong  reconstructon  pont  to  the  correct  one.  In  addton,  the 
magntude of the pre-negotated attack must be sgnfcant enough 
so that correct payloads can be extracted. The block-DCT based 
quantzaton  watermarkng  scheme  utlzng 
nequalty 
relatonshps  between  magntudes  of  DC  and  AC  coeffcents, 
together  wth  certan  attacks  that  ether  ncrease  or  decrease  the 
magntude  of  most  DCT  coeffcents,  nherently  ft  the  DII 
quantzaton watermarkng model.

2. Applications of Digital Invisible Ink 
The  DII  spread-spectrum  watermarkng  scheme  may  be  adopted 
to  allevate  the  secret  leakng  problem.  If  the  necessary  pre-
negotated  attack 
(provded  by  general-purposed  content 
processng  tools)  s  not  performed,  the  watermark  wll  never  be 
correctly  extracted  even  all  other  necessary  nformaton  s 
avalable  to  the  supervsor.  Expermental  results  also  show  that 
adequately ntroducng more-than-one attacks can further ncrease 
the securty of steganographc system. Moreover, to avod the rsk 
that messages may be secretly eavesdropped by supervsors or for 
scenaros  where  nsenstve  watermarks  are  allowed,  the  DII 
quantzaton watermarkng scheme can be utlzed to hde genune 
secrets n a cover watermark. In ths way, the sender can mslead 
the  supervsor  and  transmt  the  genune  secrets  to  the  ntended 
recever at the same tme.         
In summary, the dgtal-nvsble-nk watermarkng approach can 
mprove the capablty of exstng steganographc archtectures. In 
fact, many other mportant applcatons of exstng watermarkng 
schemes  can  also  beneft  from  the  DII  watermarkng  approach 
and wll be extensvely exploted n our future works.
