User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Using OSSEC HIPS alongside rsyslog, overkill? I have been tasked to harden our company linux servers. One of the problems that was outlined was the fact that logs are stored on the server which poses two problems:


Difficult to aggregate and diagnose problems
Not very secure, if a server is compromised then the logs could be removed or manipulated.


To address both problems the plan is to forward all logs generated by the production environment to a secure centralised logging server.

I am going to use OSSEC HIPS for intrusion detection. From what I have gathered OSSEC coagulates logs from its nodes thereby providing both centralisation of the logs and IDS monitoring; effectively hitting two birds with one stone.

What I would like to know is whether I should use additional tools to forward and store logs like rsyslog or whether that is overkill and OSSEC will be sufficient to retain all logs for X amount of time on the central log server.

Assistant: Not an overkill. Sending syslog to another host (as rsyslogd can do) is a very good practice.

OSSEC agent is valuable, but not for syslog forwarding. OSSEC only stores the specific errors that it finds interesting. For a post-mortem analysis, you need more, you need the complete logs.

Use OSSEC agent because it offers monitoring the binaries modification, rootkit detection, and fail2ban-like functionality (aka active-response).
