### Using OSSEC HIPS alongside rsyslog: Is it Overkill?

I have been tasked with hardening our company's Linux servers. One of the issues identified is that logs are currently stored on the individual servers, which presents two main problems:

1. **Aggregation and Diagnostics**: It is difficult to aggregate and diagnose issues across multiple servers.
2. **Security**: If a server is compromised, the logs could be removed or manipulated.

To address these issues, the plan is to forward all logs generated by the production environment to a secure, centralized logging server.

### Plan for Centralized Logging

I intend to use OSSEC HIPS for intrusion detection. From my research, I understand that OSSEC can aggregate logs from its nodes, providing both centralization and IDS monitoring, effectively addressing both problems with one solution.

### Question

My question is whether I should use additional tools like rsyslog to forward and store logs, or if OSSEC alone will be sufficient to retain all logs for a specified period on the central log server.

### Recommendation

Using rsyslog in conjunction with OSSEC is not overkill. In fact, it is a best practice to send syslog data to another host using rsyslog. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Comprehensive Logging**: OSSEC is designed to detect and alert on specific security events, but it does not store complete logs. For post-mortem analysis and comprehensive diagnostics, you need the full logs, which rsyslog can provide.
  
- **Centralized Storage**: Rsyslog can efficiently forward all logs to a centralized logging server, ensuring that even if a server is compromised, the logs remain intact and unaltered.

- **OSSEC Capabilities**: While OSSEC is valuable for intrusion detection, binary integrity monitoring, rootkit detection, and active response (similar to fail2ban), it is not designed to replace a robust logging solution.

### Conclusion

In summary, using both OSSEC and rsyslog is a well-rounded approach. OSSEC will handle intrusion detection and active response, while rsyslog will ensure that all logs are securely forwarded and stored centrally. This combination provides both security and operational benefits, making it a highly effective solution for your needs.
