User: Please list common types of network attacks and corresponding defense measures.
Assistant: 1. DDoS attack: The attacker controls a large number of puppet computers (or smart devices) and sends a large number of requests to the target server, causing the system resources to be exhausted and unable to respond to legitimate user requests. Defensive measures: build firewalls, CDN, IDS/IPS, DDoS cleaning equipment, etc. to filter illegal traffic. 2. SQL Injection: An attacker enters malicious code into a web application to destroy or provide access to the backend database. Defensive measures: use protective software or build a firewall, limit database privileges, use parameterized queries to avoid damage. 3. Spam: Attackers send junk advertisements or fraudulent information to a large number of email addresses. Defensive measures: Use anti-spam software or services to block email addresses and domain names of malicious senders. 4. Malware (Malware): including viruses, spyware, Trojan horses, worms, etc. Attackers can steal sensitive information or compromise systems through malware. Defensive measures: update antivirus software and operating system in time, do not download applications from unknown sources, do not click suspicious links or attachments, use security devices such as firewalls and IDS. 5. CSRF attack (Cross-site request forgery): The attacker exploits the vulnerability of the victim's browser to force a request to a website, thereby sharing the user's login password with the website. Defensive measures: Security measures such as using random tokens, checking referrer headers, etc. 6. XSS attack: The attacker injects a malicious script on the web page, which causes the script to be executed when the user browses the page, causing security problems. Defensive measures: use secure coding techniques, filter and escape user input, use HTTP headers, etc. 7. Phishing (Phishing): The attacker pretends to be an entity trusted by the victim (such as a bank, e-commerce, etc.), and uses emails, text messages, social media, etc. to trick information into being stolen. Defensive measures: educate and train users, strengthen monitoring, use anti-phishing technology and software, and take preventive measures. 8. Brute Force attack: The attacker tries to crack the password by repeatedly trying the combination of username and password. Defensive measures: use strong passwords and two-step verification, restrict and block requests, etc. 9. DNS spoofing (DNS Spoofing): Attackers direct victims to malicious sites by tampering with Domain Name System (DNS) records. Defense measures: This defense strategy can be controlled using DNSSEC technology.
