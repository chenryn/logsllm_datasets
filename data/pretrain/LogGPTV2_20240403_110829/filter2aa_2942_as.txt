**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
Heterogeneity techniques include the use of different operating systems, virtualization techniques, and multiple sources of supply. Multiple sources of supply can improve component availability and reduce the impact of a supply chain cybersecurity compromise. In case of a supply chain cybersecurity compromise, an alternative source of supply will allow the enterprises to more rapidly switch to an alternative system/component that may not be affected by the compromise. Additionally, heterogeneous components decrease the attack surface by limiting the impact to the subset of the infrastructure that is using vulnerable components.

**Applicable Levels:** 2, 3

---

### SC-30 CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
Concealment and misdirection techniques for C-SCRM include the establishment of random resupply times, the concealment of location, randomly changing the fake location used, and randomly changing or shifting information storage into alternative servers or storage mechanisms.

**Applicable Levels:** 2, 3

**Control Enhancement(s):**

#### CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | RANDOMNESS
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
Supply chain processes are necessarily structured with predictable, measurable, and repeatable processes for the purpose of efficiency and cost reduction. This opens up the opportunity for potential breach. To protect against compromise, the enterprise should employ techniques to introduce randomness into enterprise operations and assets in the enterprise’s systems or networks (e.g., randomly switching among several delivery enterprises or routes, or changing the time and date of receiving supplier software updates if previously predictably scheduled).

**Applicable Levels:** 2, 3

#### CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING AND STORAGE LOCATIONS
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
Changes in processing or storage locations can be used to protect downloads, deliveries, or associated supply chain metadata. The enterprise may leverage such techniques within their information systems and networks to create uncertainty about the activities targeted by adversaries. Establishing a few process changes and randomizing their use—whether it is for receiving, acceptance testing, storage, or other supply chain activities—can aid in reducing the likelihood of a supply chain event.

**Applicable Levels:** 2, 3

#### CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
The enterprise can convey misleading information as part of concealment and misdirection efforts to protect the information system being developed and the enterprise’s systems and networks. Examples of such efforts in security include honeynets or virtualized environments. Implementations can be leveraged to convey misleading information. These may be considered advanced techniques that require experienced resources to effectively implement them. If an enterprise decides to use honeypots, it should be done in concert with legal counsel or following the enterprise’s policies.

**Applicable Levels:** 2, 3

#### CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
The enterprise may employ various concealment and misdirection techniques to protect information about the information system being developed and the enterprise’s information systems and networks. For example, the delivery of critical components to a central or trusted third-party depot can be used to conceal or misdirect any information regarding the component’s use or the enterprise using the component. Separating components from their associated information into differing physical and electronic delivery channels and obfuscating the information through various techniques can be used to conceal information and reduce the opportunity for a potential loss of confidentiality of the component or its use, condition, or other attributes.

**Applicable Levels:** 2, 3
