SA-16  DEVELOPER-PROVIDED TRAINING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Developer-provided training for external and internal developers is 
critical to C-SCRM. It addresses training the individuals responsible for federal systems and networks to 
include applicable development environments. Developer-provided training in this control also applies to 
the individuals who select system and network components. Developer-provided training should include C-
SCRM material to ensure that 1) developers are aware of potential threats and vulnerabilities when 
developing, testing, and maintaining hardware and software, and 2) the individuals responsible for selecting 
system and network components incorporate C-SCRM when choosing such components. Developer 
training should also cover training for secure coding and the use of tools to find vulnerabilities in software.

SA-20 CUSTOMIZED DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise may decide, based on their assessments of cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain, that they require customized development of certain critical components. 
This control provides additional guidance on this activity. Enterprises should work with suppliers and 
partners to ensure that critical components are identified. Organizations should ensure that they have a 
continued ability to maintain custom-developed critical software components. For example, having the 
source code, build scripts, and tests for a software component could enable an organization to have 
someone else maintain it if necessary.

SA-21  DEVELOPER SCREENING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should implement screening processes for their internal 
developers. For system integrators who may be providing key developers that address critical components, 
the enterprise should ensure that appropriate processes for developer screening have been used. The 
screening of developers should be included as a contractual requirement and be a flow-down requirement to 
relevant sub-level subcontractors who provide development services or who have access to the 
development environment.

SA-22  UNSUPPORTED SYSTEM COMPONENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Acquiring products directly from qualified original equipment 
manufacturers (OEMs) or their authorized distributors and resellers reduces cybersecurity risks in the 
supply chain. In the case of unsupported system components, the enterprise should use authorized resellers 
or distributors with an ongoing relationship with the supplier of the unsupported system components.   
When purchasing alternative sources for continued support, enterprises should acquire directly from vetted 
original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or their authorized distributors and resellers. Decisions about

FAMILY: SYSTEM AND COMMUNICATIONS PROTECTION 
[FIPS 200] specifies the System and Communications Protection minimum security requirement 
as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) monitor, control, and protect organizational communications 
(i.e., information transmitted or received by organizational information systems) at the 
external boundaries and key internal boundaries of the information systems; and (ii) 
employ architectural designs, software development techniques, and systems 
engineering principles that promote effective information security within organizational 
information systems.  
An enterprise’s communications infrastructure is composed of ICT/OT components and systems, 
which have their own supply chains. These communications allow users or administrators to 
remotely access an enterprise’s systems and to connect to the internet, other ICT/OT within the 
enterprise, contractor systems, and – occasionally – supplier systems. An enterprise’s 
communications infrastructure may be provided and supported by suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers.  
SC-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: System and communications protection policies and procedures should 
address cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain in relation to the enterprise’s processes, systems, 
and networks. Enterprise-level and program-specific policies help establish and clarify these requirements, 
and corresponding procedures provide instructions for meeting these requirements. Policies and procedures 
should include the coordination of communications among and across multiple enterprise entities within the 
enterprise, as well as the communications methods, external connections, and processes used between the 
enterprise and its suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers.

INFORMATION IN SHARED RESOURCES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise may share information system resources with system 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers. Protecting information in shared resources in support of various supply chain activities is 
challenging when outsourcing key operations. Enterprises may either share too much and increase their risk 
or share too little and make it difficult for suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers to be efficient in their service delivery. The 
enterprise should work with developers to define a structure or process for information sharing, including 
the data shared, the method of sharing, and to whom (the specific roles) the information is provided. 
Appropriate privacy, dissemination, handling, and clearance requirements should be accounted for in the 
information-sharing process.

BOUNDARY PROTECTION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should implement appropriate monitoring mechanisms 
and processes at the boundaries between the agency systems and suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers’ systems. Provisions for 
boundary protections should be incorporated into agreements with suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. There may be 
multiple interfaces throughout the enterprise, supplier systems and networks, and the SDLC. Appropriate 
vulnerability, threat, and risk assessments should be performed to ensure proper boundary protections for 
supply chain components and supply chain information flow. The vulnerability, threat, and risk 
assessments can aid in scoping boundary protection to a relevant set of criteria and help manage associated 
costs. For contracts with external service providers, enterprises should ensure that the provider satisfies 
boundary control requirements pertinent to environments and networks within their span of control. Further 
detail is provided in Section 2 and Appendix C. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to 
implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and 
agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 
14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

development, test, and security assessment tools and operational environments and relevant monitoring 
tools within the enterprise’s information systems and networks. This control applies the entity 
responsible for creating software and hardware, to include federal agencies and prime contractors. As 
such, this controls applies to the federal agency and applicable supplier information systems and 
networks. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down 
this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. If a compromise or information leakage happens in 
any one environment, the other environments should still be protected through the separation and 
isolation mechanisms or techniques.

TRANSMISSION CONFIDENTIALITY AND INTEGRITY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The requirements for transmission confidentiality and integrity should 
be integrated into agreements with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Acquirers, suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers may repurpose existing 
security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, authorization, or encryption) to achieve enterprise confidentiality 
and integrity requirements. The degree of protection should be based on the sensitivity of information to be 
transmitted and the relationship between the enterprise and the suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Enterprises should require 
their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier 
contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in 
accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

system. Examples include ensuring that mobile code originates from vetted sources when acquired, that 
vetted system integrators are used for the development of custom mobile code or prior to installing, and 
that verification processes are in place for acceptance criteria prior to installation in order to verify the 
source and integrity of code. Note that mobile code can be both code for the underlying information 
systems and networks (e.g., RFID device applications) or for information systems and components.

SC-27  PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT APPLICATIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The use of trusted platform-independent applications is essential to C-
SCRM. The enhanced portability of platform-independent applications enables enterprises to switch 
external service providers more readily in the event that one becomes compromised, thereby reducing 
vendor-dependent cybersecurity risks. This is especially relevant for critical applications on which multiple 
systems may rely. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
SC-28  PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AT REST 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should include provisions for the protection of 
information at rest into their agreements with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. The enterprise should also ensure that they 
provide appropriate protections within the information systems and networks for data at rest for the 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers information, such as source code, testing data, blueprints, and intellectual property 
information. This control should be applied throughout the SDLC, including during requirements, 
development, manufacturing, test, inventory management, maintenance, and disposal. Enterprises should 
require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-
tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in

SC-29 HETEROGENEITY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Heterogeneity techniques include the use of different operating systems, 
virtualization techniques, and multiple sources of supply. Multiple sources of supply can improve 
component availability and reduce the impact of a supply chain cybersecurity compromise. In case of a 
supply chain cybersecurity compromise, an alternative source of supply will allow the enterprises to more 
rapidly switch to an alternative system/component that may not be affected by the compromise. 
Addtionally, heterogeneous components decrease the attack surface by limiting the impact to the subset of 
the infrastructure that is using vulnerable components.

the opportunity for potential breach. In order to protect against compromise, the enterprise should 
employ techniques to introduce randomness into enterprise operations and assets in the enterprise’s 
systems or networks (e.g., randomly switching among several delivery enterprises or routes, or 
changing the time and date of receiving supplier software updates if previously predictably scheduled). 
Level(s): 2, 3 
(2) 
CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CHANGE PROCESSING AND STORAGE LOCATIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Changes in processing or storage locations can be used to protect 
downloads, deliveries, or associated supply chain metadata. The enterprise may leverage such 
techniques within the their information systems and networks to create uncertainty about the activities 
targeted by adversaries. Establishing a few process changes and randomizing their use – whether it is 
for receiving, acceptance testing, storage, or other supply chain activities – can aid in reducing the 
likelihood of a supply chain event.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
(3) 
CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | MISLEADING INFORMATION  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise can convey misleading information as part of 
concealment and misdirection efforts to protect the information system being developed and the 
enterprise’s systems and networks. Examples of such efforts in security include honeynets or 
virtualized environments. Implementations can be leveraged to convey misleading information. These 
may be considered advanced techniques that require experienced resources to effectively implement 
them. If an enterprise decides to use honeypots, it should be done in concert with legal counsel or 
following the enterprise’s policies. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
(4) 
CONCEALMENT AND MISDIRECTION | CONCEALMENT OF SYSTEM COMPONENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise may employ various concealment and misdirection 
techniques to protect information about the information system being developed and the enterprise’s 
information systems and networks. For example, the delivery of critical components to a central or 
trusted third-party depot can be used to conceal or misdirect any information regarding the 
component’s use or the enterprise using the component. Separating components from their associated 
information into differing physical and electronic delivery channels and obfuscating the information 
through various techniques can be used to conceal information and reduce the opportunity for a 
potential loss of confidentiality of the component or its use, condition, or other attributes. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
SC-36  DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING AND STORAGE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Processing and storage can be distributed both across the enterprise’s 
systems and networks and across the SDLC. The enterprise should ensure that these techniques are applied 
in both contexts. Development, manufacturing, configuration management, test, maintenance, and 
operations can use distributed processing and storage. This control applies to the entity responsible for 
processing and storage functions or related infrastructure, to include federal agencies and contractors. As 
such, this control applies to the federal agency and applicable supplier information systems and networks. 
Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.
