There is no environment variable equivalent to `-J`/`--sysimage` option for
specifying a custom image for Julia instance. I think supporting a variable
like `JULIA_SYSIMAGE` can be quite useful when deploying Julia for custom
environment, i.e. deploying in a Docker container with custom system image
baked in.
Currently, one would have to manually add an option every time or create a
wrapper script to launch Julia with custom image, especially when replacing
default system image is not an option (i.e. repo2docker does not allow root
privileges for touching system image when using default Julia buildpak).
