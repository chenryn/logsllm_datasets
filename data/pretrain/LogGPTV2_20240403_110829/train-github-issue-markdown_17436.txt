There is currently no environment variable equivalent to the `-J` or `--sysimage` option for specifying a custom system image in Julia. Introducing an environment variable, such as `JULIA_SYSIMAGE`, would be highly beneficial, particularly when deploying Julia in customized environments, such as within a Docker container with a pre-built custom system image.

Currently, users must either manually add the `-J` or `--sysimage` option each time they launch Julia or create a wrapper script to handle this. This is especially cumbersome when replacing the default system image is not an option, for example, in scenarios where `repo2docker` does not provide root privileges to modify the system image in the default Julia buildpack.

By supporting an environment variable like `JULIA_SYSIMAGE`, the process of using a custom system image would be streamlined, making it more convenient and efficient for developers.
