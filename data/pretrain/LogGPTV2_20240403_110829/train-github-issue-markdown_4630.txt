While using scipy.optimize.linprog(method="highs"), I encountered a status
message stating "The solver did not provide a solution nor did it report a
failure" and asking for a bug report, which I am hereby writing :-)
As I have little experience in numerics, I make no claims about the qualities
(feasibility, boundedness, etc) of the problem I was trying to solve. (I was
trying to deactivate bounds I did not require by setting b_ub elements to a
large value (100000.0). I have no idea if that is part of the problem.)
#### Reproducing code example:
Please see the attached file for problem parameters: bug_reproducer.py.gz
(Some 3MB uncompressed. As I have no idea what is causing the problem, I can
not build a minimal reproducer, sorry).  
Gist of the code:
    import numpy, scipy.optimize
    c=...
    A_ub=...
    b_ub=...
    res=scipy.optimize.linprog(c=c, A_ub=A_ub, b_ub=b_ub, method='highs')
    print('status=', res.status)
    print('message=', res.message)
#### Error message:
    /home/philipp/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/optimize/_linprog_highs.py:317: OptimizeWarning: model_status is not optimal, using scaled_model_status instead.
      lb, ub, options)
    status= 4
    message= The solver did not provide a solution nor did it report a failure. Please submit a bug report.
#### Scipy/Numpy/Python version information:
    >import sys, scipy, numpy; print(scipy.__version__, numpy.__version__, sys.version_info)
    1.6.1 1.20.1 sys.version_info(major=3, minor=7, micro=3, releaselevel='final', serial=0)
Thanks for your time,
