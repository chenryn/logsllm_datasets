User: There is a large amount of duplicate data in a database table, how to perform deduplication operations through SQL statements?
Assistant: You can use the DISTINCT keyword to deduplicate, for example: SELECT DISTINCT column name FROM table name; Among them, the DISTINCT keyword will return unique and unique values. It should be noted that if there are NULL values in the table, they will also be considered as a unique value, so there may be multiple NULL values. If you need to exclude NULL values, you can use the IS NOT NULL condition to filter.
