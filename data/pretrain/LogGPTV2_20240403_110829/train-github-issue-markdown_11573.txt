The error you are encountering is as follows:

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Op

has been removed in version 9. Use tf.nn.batch_normalization().

```

It appears that the `BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation, which was used in your model, has been deprecated and removed in TensorFlow version 9. The recommended replacement is `tf.nn.batch_normalization`.

### Possible Causes and Solutions

1. **Outdated Model or Library**:
   - **Cause**: Your Java application might be using an older version of a pre-trained model that still contains the deprecated `BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation.
   - **Solution**: Update the pre-trained model to a version that uses `tf.nn.batch_normalization`. Alternatively, if you have access to the source code of the model, replace the deprecated operation with the new one.

2. **TensorFlow Java Library Version**:
   - **Cause**: The TensorFlow Java libraries you are using might be outdated and do not support the newer operations.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of the TensorFlow Java libraries. You can check the version by looking at your project's dependencies. If necessary, update to the latest version.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Update the Model**:
   - If you are using a pre-trained model, check for an updated version that supports the current TensorFlow operations.
   - If you have the model's source code, replace the `BatchNormWithGlobalNormalization` operation with `tf.nn.batch_normalization`.

2. **Update TensorFlow Java Libraries**:
   - Check your project's build file (e.g., `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle) and ensure that you are using the latest version of the TensorFlow Java libraries.
   - For example, in a Maven `pom.xml`:
     ```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.tensorflow</groupId>
         <artifactId>tensorflow</artifactId>
         <version>2.x.x</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
     </dependency>
     ```

3. **Re-import the Updated Model**:
   - After updating the model and libraries, re-import the updated model into your Java application and test it to ensure the issue is resolved.

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your setup, including the versions of TensorFlow and the Java libraries you are using, so that further assistance can be provided.
