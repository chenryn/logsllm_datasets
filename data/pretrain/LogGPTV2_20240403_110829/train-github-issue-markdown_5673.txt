**Feature**
In Angular 1 it was possible to store the intermediate result of a filtered
ngFor. Since v1.3 beta17 it's even easier by using an alias expression. See
the docs here:
https://code.angularjs.org/1.3.0-beta.17/docs/api/ng/directive/ngRepeat. But
in Angular 2 this feature seems to be missing.
**Use case as an example**
My (example) use case: I'm using a pipe to filter a list of items depending on
a search text. When the result list is empty, I want to be able to notify the
user about this empty state, e.g. with a text "No search results." or similar.
In addition, it would be nice to show the number of found search results at
any time. In Angular 1, I was able to save the intermediate filter result in a
variable and work with its length property to achieve this.
Will this feature be coming in Angualr 2 or should we better not use a Pipe in
this case? Although I think a Pipe is the nicest solution here.
