This is a feature request.  
Can we have variable-sized (non-square) GridView widgets? E.g. the example
from https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/GridView-class.html:
    new GridView.count(
      primary: false,
      padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20.0),
      crossAxisSpacing: 10.0,
      crossAxisCount: 2,
      children: [
        const Text('He\'d have you all unravel at the'),
        const Text('Heed not the rabble'),
        const Text('Sound of screams but the'),
        const Text('Who scream'),
        const Text('Revolution is coming...'),
        const Text('Revolution, they...'),
      ],
    )

This results in a lot of extra space below the text, since each grid item is
square. It would be neat to set the height of each grid item. The simplest
would be to set all the grid items to the same height. But we could envision
the height being determined based on the height of the child widgets.
We could use a Wrap widget to have child widgets of variable heights, but then
there is no scrolling.
