noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (NISQ) machine [56] can use
quantum resources to deliver a speedup [34]. For instance, recently
Boixo et al. [5] and Denchev et al. [22] have found evidence that

tunneling under ideal conditions can be exploited on an earlier
model of the D-Wave 2000Q (DW2Q) machine, delivering many or-
ders of magnitude speedup against CPU-based simulated annealing,
which is considered to be one of the best classical competitions to
Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). QPUs also outperform GPU im-
plementations by several orders of magnitude in random problems
whose structure is related to real world optimization problems [38].
The DW2Q is an analog optimizer, meaning that it computes
continuously rather than in discrete clock cycles, and that it repre-
sents numerical quantities as analog instead of digital quantities.
The hardware initializes each of its N constituent quantum bits, or
qubits, to begin in a superposition state 1/√2(|0⟩ + |1⟩) that has no
classical counterpart. In concrete terms, these qubits are metallic
circuits in a chip that are maintained in a superconducting state
by low temperature and subjected to the influence of tailored mag-
netic fluxes. The collection of N qubits at this point in time encodes
all the possible 2N outputs in a single state. This initial setting
is achieved by exposing all the qubits in the chip to a signal A(t)
whose magnitude at this point in time is maximal. Then the system
implements an objective function which is represented by another
signal B(t) and is ramped up from zero, while A(t) is decreased pro-
gressively at the same time. The synchronized sequence of signals
A and B and their time dependence is the annealing schedule. The
schedule is essentially the QA algorithm, and has to be optimized
so that at the end of the run (B(t) = max and A(t) = 0), each qubit
in the chip assumes either a value of |0⟩ or |1⟩, corresponding to
classical bit values, 0 or 1, respectively. This final state of these
qubits collectively represents a candidate solution of the problem,
ideally the ground state of the system (i.e., the minimum of the
optimization objective function) [24, 35].
In practice, at the end of the run, the ground state will be found
with a probability that depends on the degree to which the sched-
ule is optimal for the problem at hand, as well as on the effect of
uncontrollable QA noise and environmental interference on the
annealer. While the quantum community is investigating physics
principles to guide schedule parameters, most clearly-understood
theoretical principles do not apply to current, imperfect experimen-
tal systems [34]. Hence the empirical approach, which we take in
this paper, represents current state-of-the-art [58]. Three degrees
of freedom are specifically investigated in this work.
• First, there are many ways of mapping a problem to an equiva-
lent Ising formulation that runs on the machine (we investigate
one such mapping in Section 3).
• Second, the user may accelerate or delay A(t)/B(t) evolution,
thus determining annealing time (1–300 µs), the duration of the
machine’s computation.
• Finally, the user may introduce stops (anneal pause) in the an-
nealing process, which have been shown to improve perfor-
mance in certain settings [43].
3 DESIGN
Starting from the abstract QA problem form (§3.1), QuAMax’s de-
sign reduces ML detection to form (§3.2), then compiles it on actual
hardware, a process called embedding (§3.3).

QPSK modulation. In the case of quadrature phase shift keying
(QPSK), each sender transmits one of four possible symbols ¯vi
∈ {±1 ± 1j}. Since it can be viewed as a two-dimensional BPSK vi =

symbol with the linear combination of one QUBO variable, plus
the other QUBO variable times the imaginary unit. Transforming
q2i−1 and q2i to vI
respectively leads to the transform

vi = T(qi) = (2q2i−1 − 1) + j(2q2i − 1).
Higher-order modulation. 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
(16-QAM) and higher-order modulations increase spectral efficiency,
but utilize multiple amplitudes (levels) so require a T that inputs
more than one (binary) solution variable per I or Q dimension. First
consider a transform T for the simplest multi-level 1-D constella-
11 . T = 4q1 + 2q2 − 3 maps these bits to
tion:
the values −3,−1, +1, +3. Now to generalize this to 2-D, let the first
two arguments of T, q4i−3, q4i−2, represent the I part and the next
two, q4i−1, q4i represent the Q part. We call this transform, shown
in Fig. 2(a), the 16-QAM QuAMax transform. It has the desirable
property that it maps solution variables to symbols linearly, viz.
vi = T(qi) = (4q4i−3 +2q4i−2 −3) + j(4q4i−1 +2q4i −3), thus results
in a QUBO form.
