User: When I'm administering dozens of servers with Fabric, I often don't care about the specifics of the commands being run on each server, instead I want to collate small bits of information from each host and present it in summary at the end.
Does Fabric support this functionality itself? (I've searched the documentation to no avail, but perhaps I missed something).
Otherwise I suppose one could aggregate this information manually and then add an exit handler, but this feels like something that could be a common use case.
As an example, I have a some scripts that do some basic security checks on a number of servers, and I'd like to create a report at the end instead of scrolling through the output for each server. I don't want to restrict Fabric's output, since if there is an issue I want to scroll back to pinpoint it.
Assistant: It's just python, so you can print whatever you'd like, as well as making your own decorator to wrap the task and spit that out. As it stands though there isn't anything in core nor contrib that does that.
