       1. [Configure bot protection for Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/bot-protection).
       1. [Create and use Web Application Firewall v2 custom rules.](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/create-custom-waf-rules).
2.  **For all endpoints (HTTP or not)**, front with [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) for threat intelligence-based filtering at Layer 4:
    1.  [Deploy and configure Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/tutorial-firewall-deploy-portal) using the Azure portal.
    1.  [Enable threat intelligence-based filtering](/azure/firewall/threat-intel) for your traffic.

### III. Encryption: User-to-app internal traffic is encrypted
The third initial objective to focus on is adding encryption to ensure user-to-app internal traffic is encrypted.
Follow these steps:
1.  Enforce HTTPS-only communication for your internet facing web applications by [redirecting HTTP traffic to HTTPS using Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/front-door-how-to-redirect-https).
2.  Connect remote employees/partners to Microsoft Azure using the [Azure VPN Gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways).
    1.  [Turn on encryption](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-security-controls#data-protection) for any point-to-site traffic in Azure VPN Gateway service.
3.  Access your Azure virtual machines securely using encrypted communication via [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview).
    1.  [Connect using SSH to a Linux virtual machine](/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-ssh).
    1.  [Connect using RDP to a Windows virtual machine](/azure/bastion/bastion-connect-vm-rdp).

### IV. Network segmentation: Fully distributed ingress/egress cloud micro-perimeters and deeper micro-segmentation
Once you've accomplished your initial three objectives, the next step is to further segment your network.
#### Partition app components to different subnets
:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-azure-region-virtual-network-servers.png" alt-text="Diagram of a virtual network of servers in the Azure region." border="true":::
Follow these steps:
1.  Within the VNet, [add virtual network subnets](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet) so that discrete components of an application can have their own perimeters.
2.  [Apply network security group rules](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic#create-security-rules) to allow traffic only from the subnets that have an app subcomponent identified as a legitimate communications counterpart.
#### Segment and enforce the external boundaries
:::image type="content" source="../media/diagram-servers-devices-boundaries-azure-vpn.png" alt-text="Diagram of a servers and devices with connections across boundaries." border="true":::
Follow these steps, depending on the type of boundary:
##### Internet boundary
1.  If internet connectivity is required for your application that needs to be routed via the hub VNet, [update the network security group rules](/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-filter-network-traffic) in hub VNet to allow internet connectivity.
2.  [Turn on Azure DDoS Protection Standard](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection#enable-ddos-for-an-existing-virtual-network)
    to protect the hub VNet from volumetric network layer attacks.
3.  If your application uses HTTP/S protocols, [turn on Azure Web Application Firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/afds/waf-front-door-custom-rules-powershell) to protect against Layer 7 threats.
##### On-premises boundary
1.  If your app needs connectivity to your on-premise data center, [use Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager) of Azure VPN [for connectivity to your hub VNet](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal).
2.  [Configure the Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/tutorial-hybrid-ps) in the hub VNet to inspect and govern traffic.
##### PaaS services boundary
 - When using Azure-provided PaaS services (e.g., Azure Storage, [Azure Cosmos DB](/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-cosmosdb-portal),
    or [Azure Web App](/azure/private-link/create-private-endpoint-webapp-portal), use the [PrivateLink](/azure/private-link/create-private-link-service-portal) connectivity option to ensure all data exchanges are over the private IP space and the traffic never leaves the Microsoft network.

### V. Threat protection: Machine learning-based threat protection and filtering with context-based signals
For further threat protection, turn on [Azure DDoS Protection Standard](/azure/virtual-network/ddos-protection-overview) to constantly monitor your Azure-hosted application traffic, use ML-based frameworks to baseline and detect volumetric traffic floods, and apply automatic mitigations.
Follow these steps:
1.  [Configure and manage](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection) Azure DDoS Protection Standard.
1.  [Configure alerts](/azure/virtual-network/manage-ddos-protection#configure-alerts-for-ddos-protection-metrics) for DDoS protection metrics.
### VI. Encryption: All traffic is encrypted
Finally, complete your network protection by ensuring that all traffic is encrypted.
Follow these steps:
1.  [Encrypt application backend traffic](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-ipsecikepolicy-rm-powershell) between virtual networks.
1.  Encrypt traffic between on-premises and cloud:
    1.  [Configure a site-to-site VPN](/azure/expressroute/site-to-site-vpn-over-microsoft-peering) over ExpressRoute Microsoft peering.
    1.  [Configure IPsec transport mode](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-ipsec-transport-private-windows) for ExpressRoute private peering.
### VII. Discontinue legacy network security technology
Discontinue the use of signature-based Network Intrusion Detection/Network Intrusion Prevention (NIDS/NIPS) Systems and Network Data Leakage/Loss Prevention (DLP).
The major cloud service providers already filter for malformed packets and common network layer attacks, so there's no need for a NIDS/NIPS solution to detect those. In addition, traditional NIDS/NIPS solutions are typically driven by signature-based approaches (which are considered outdated) and are easily evaded by attackers and typically produce a high rate of false positives.
Network-based DLP is decreasingly effective at identifying both inadvertent and deliberate data loss. The reason for this is that most modern protocols and attackers use network-level encryption for inbound and outbound communications. The only viable workaround for this is "SSL-bridging" which provides an "authorized man-in-the-middle" that terminates and then reestablishes encrypted network connections. The SSL-bridging approach has fallen out of favor because of the level of trust required for the partner running the solution and the technologies that are being used.
Based on this rationale, we offer an all-up recommendation that you discontinue use of these legacy network security technologies. However, if your organizational experience is that these technologies have had a palpable impact on preventing and detecting real attacks, you can consider porting them to your cloud environment.
