#### Presenter
- **Joe Grand (@joegrand)**, also known as Kingpin
- **Grand Idea Studio, Inc.**

#### Overview of PCB Reverse Engineering
- **Definition**: The process of "undesigning" an existing system.
- **Methods**:
  - Destructive
  - Non-destructive
- **Applications**:
  - Determining system or subsystem functionality
  - Security research and verification
  - Forensic analysis and intelligence
  - Cloning a design
  - Injecting new (potentially malicious) behavior
- **Key Steps**:
  - Access to copper layers
  - Analyzing layout rules and features
  - Tracing component interconnections

#### Deconstruction Techniques
1. **Solder Mask Removal**
2. **Delayering**
3. **Imaging**

##### Solder Mask Removal
- **Chemical Methods**:
  - **Ristoff C-8 (NWE Chem Research, UK)**
  - **Magnastrip 500 (RBP Chemical Technology, US)**
  - **Process**:
    - Heat the chemical
    - Soak the PCB
    - Rinse in water
    - Brush lightly with a soft metal brush
  - **Processing Time**: 45-120 minutes, depending on chemical temperature, solder mask composition, and thickness.
  - **Safety Note**: Requires hazardous chemical handling and disposal procedures.

- **Laser Methods**:
  - **LPKF MicroLine 600D UV Laser System @ A-Laser, Milpitas, CA**
  - **Accuracy**: ±0.6 mil, max. travel speed: 300 mm/sec, beam diameter: 20 μm
  - **Single Pass at Medium Power**
  - **Copper Layer**: Remains fully intact
  - **Material Reactions**:
    - Solder mask and FR4 ablate more quickly than copper
    - Incorrect laser power settings or too many passes can damage underlying copper

##### Delayering
- **Techniques**:
  - **Sandpaper/Rubbing Stone**:
    - **Cost-Effective Method**
    - **Process**:
      - Affix to work surface with double-sided tape
      - Full strokes across the entire PCB with hard pressure
      - One layer at a time
    - **Challenges**:
      - Physical workout leading to operator fatigue
      - Minor scratching of inner copper layer
      - Noticeable wearing along edges due to uneven sanding

  - **Dremel Tool**:
    - **Tool**: Dremel MultiPro 395 w/ 503 Flapwheel (120 grit, 3/8" wide)
    - **Process**:
      - Back and forth across the PCB with medium pressure
    - **Challenges**:
      - Difficult to keep the tool flat against the PCB
      - Easy to accidentally remove too much material
      - More care and practice required

  - **CNC Milling**:
    - **System**: T-Tech QuickCircuit 5000 PCB Prototyping System
    - **Features**:
      - Z-axis manually adjustable in 10 μm increments
      - Think & Tinker MN208-1250-019F 1/8” diameter carbide endmill
      - Software: IsoPro 2.7 for control and manipulation
    - **Process**:
      - Incrementally adjust Z-axis depth
      - Manual jog to mill away desired areas
      - Resulting PCB has a stair-step that can be visually identified and felt
    - **Challenges**:
      - Accurate and repeatable positioning
      - Z-axis depth adjusted in 1 mil increments
      - Switch to manual abrasion using a fiberglass scratch brush when copper is visible

  - **Surface Grinding**:
    - **System**: Blohm PROFIMAT CNC Creep Feed Surface Grinder
    - **Features**:
      - Depth control in 0.1 mil increments
      - Target PCB mounted to a steel block held by a magnetic chuck
    - **Process**:
      - Rotating abrasive wheel
      - Work surface and reciprocating or rotary table

##### Imaging
- **X-ray (2D)**:
  - **System**: Nordson DAGE XD7500VR X-ray Inspection System
  - **Applications**:
    - PCB assembly (component placement/solder quality)
    - Failure analysis (troubleshooting defective features)
  - **Process**:
    - X-rays passed through the target and received on a detector
    - Provides a composite image of all layers
  - **Benefits**:
    - Clues about PCB construction/layout, component location, layer count, hidden/embedded features
    - For simple boards, traces and interconnections can be visually followed

- **Computed Tomography (CT) (3D)**:
  - **System**: Nordson DAGE XD7600NT Ruby X-ray Inspection System
  - **Process**:
    - Series of 2D X-ray images post-processed to create cross-sectional slices
    - X-ray beam rotated 360° in a single axis around the target
  - **Applications**:
    - Complex inspection and failure analysis of PCBs, component packaging, solder ball/joint quality
  - **Post-Processing**:
    - 2D slices viewed in any plane (X, Y, Z)
    - Manipulated with 3D modeling software
  - **Benefits**:
    - Identify each layer
    - Measure substrate thickness between layers
    - Limited field-of-view may require multiple segments to be stitched together

#### Characterization Matrix
- **Next Steps**:
  - Test additional delayering techniques (e.g., Methyl Ethyl Ketone, drum sander)
  - Develop a software toolkit (in progress):
    - Automated/assisted creation of schematics based on PCB layer images
    - Computer vision/image processing routines
    - Open source, cross-platform (Python + OpenCV)
