## Chapter 1: Quick Flex Parser Tool

### Parser Tool Audience
The Quick Flex Parser Tool is intended for users who will be developing parser properties files for use with ArcSight products. It is expected that users will have expertise in regex expressions, parser development, and the FlexConnector framework.

### Features and Benefits
The Quick Flex Parser Tool allows you to generate a parser file suitable for use in the FlexConnector framework by providing the following capabilities:
- Load a log file up to 200MB in size
- Search and filter messages in the Log View
- Detect syslog headers in log files
- Create and reuse tokens
- Build a token repository
- Construct token filters from tokens
- Use a different log file from the device to work on base regex and token filters
- Override the token regex or use the original token regex depending on the token filter
- Change a token or token filter property in one place and apply it globally
- Switch to token filter edit mode from different places in the tool
- Export token filter test results to files for further analysis

The tool also provides the following features to help you analyze the log file and track your progress:
- Message highlighting in the Base Regex and Token Filter Managers to indicate whether tokens are parsing the log lines successfully
- Message highlighting in the Log View to indicate if lines are parsed successfully and whether a particular message is being parsed by multiple token filters
- Graphical statistics in the Log View to track your progress in analyzing the log file
- Tests to detect whether the parsing you defined makes sense; you can drill down into the test results to determine why a test might have failed

### Parser Tool Workflow Summary
The following tasks provide a high-level description of how to use the Quick Flex Parser Tool to create a parser file suitable for the FlexConnector framework:

1. **Create a parser file project**
   - Quick Flex Parser Tool creates parser files within the context of a project. The project contains the definitions of your tokens, base regex, token filters, and mappings based on the content of a log file.
   - When you create a project, you load the log file and identify the folder to store your results. See "Creating and Opening Parser Projects" for more details.

2. **Create the base regex**
   - The base regex (also known as a preparser) is used to process headers from all messages in a file or stream.
   - The base regex is a regular expression that corresponds to the regex in the connector parser file.
   - The base regex must match all log lines in a file. Edit the base regex until all messages are processed. See "Create a Base Regex" for more details.

3. **Create tokens and token filters**
   - Create tokens based on the content of the message. A token is a tag that identifies a data field or other useful information in a message.
   - Verify that the tokens work for all of the specified messages.
   - Use the tokens to build a token filter. A token filter is the tokenized form of a message or log record.
   - See "Create a Token", "Create a Token Filter", and "Override Token Regex" for more details.

4. **Test the token filters**
   - Test log lines against the token filters to see if the parsing makes sense or if the matching against the log lines works.
   - The log lines are parsed by a combination of the base regex and token filters. Ideally, each log line should be matched by only one token filter.
   - If a log line is matched by more than one token filter, resolve the situation by creating new token filters as needed.
   - The Quick Flex Parser Tool uses highlighting in the Log View to identify portions of the log line that are matched by the base regex and by the token filters.
   - The Log View also identifies lines that match the token filter, do not match the token filter, or are matched by multiple token filters.
   - See "Quick Flex Parser Tool Log View", "Highlighting Patterns in Log Lines", and "Managing and Testing Token Filters" for more details.

5. **Generate the parser properties file**
   - Generate the parser properties file based on the tokens, base regex, token filters, and mappings you created.
   - This file can be imported into the FlexConnector framework.
   - See "Generate a Parser File" for more details.

## Chapter 2: Creating and Opening Parser Projects

You can perform the following tasks on the Quick Flex Parser Tool Landing Page for a parser file project:
- Create a Parser File Project
- Open a Parser Project
- View a Workflow Summary

### Create a Parser File Project
**Navigation:** Landing Page > Create New

**About:**
Parser file projects:
- Quick Flex Parser Tool creates a parser file within the scope of a project.
- The project contains the definitions of your tokens, token filters, and their respective mappings based on the content of a log file.
- The result of the project is a `.properties` file that is suitable for parsing the content of a log file within the FlexConnector framework.

**Procedure:**
1. Click **Create New** on the Landing Page to open the New Project dialog.
2. Select **Parser Project** to create a parser file project.
3. Enter the following information in the Create New Project page:
   - The name of the vendor who provided the log file
   - (Optional) The name of the product that produced the log file
   - (Optional) The version number of the product
   - Note: The vendor and product names defined are mapped automatically to their corresponding fields.
   - If you do not specify these details at the beginning of a project, you can specify them later by selecting **File > Edit Project Properties** in the Log View.
4. For Parser projects: select **Syslog File** if you are working with a syslog log file.
5. (Optional) Click **Browse** to navigate to the log file.
   - If you do not select a log file at the beginning of a project, you can select it later by selecting **File > Open Log File** in the Log View.
   - For parser file projects only:
     - Comments and empty log lines can be left in the log file that gets uploaded. The Quick Flex Parser Tool identifies these lines and displays them but does not count them towards the total log lines, as they do not need to be parsed. You can view the comments in the Incomplete tab if you are interested.
     - Select the **Parser Project** checkbox and leave the **Syslog File** checkbox on to acknowledge that the log file has Syslog Headers before loading it into the tool.
     - The limitation on the size of log files for parser file projects is 200 MB.
6. Click **Browse** to navigate to the location where you want to store your project artifacts.
7. Click **Create**. The log file is loaded into the Log View.
   - A JSON project file is created. The name of the file is a concatenation of a prefix to indicate whether the file belongs to a parser file or a CEF verification project (pt or cef), the vendor name, the product name, and the version number (prefix_vendor_product_version.json). For example, `cef_vendorXYZ_productABC_1.json` or `pt_vendorUVW_productDEF_1.json`.

### Open a Parser Project
**Navigation:** Log View > File > Open Project

1. Select **File > Open Project** and select the name of the project.
2. The log file and any associated project artifacts are loaded into the Quick Flex Parser Tool.
   - Quick Flex Parser Tool project names have the format `.json`.
   - Note: Each project file contains a path pointing to the location of the log file. If the log file is moved, the project will need to be updated to reflect the new location.
