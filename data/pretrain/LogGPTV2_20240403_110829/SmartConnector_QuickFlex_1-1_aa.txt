Quick Flex Parser Tool
Parser Tool Audience
The Quick Flex Parser Tool is intended for users who will be developing parser properties files that can be used with ArcSight products. It is expected that users will have expertise in regex expressions, parser development, and the FlexConnector framework.
Features and BenefitsFeatures and Benefits
Quick Flex Parser Tool allows you to generate a parser file suitable for use in the FlexConnector framework by giving you the ability to do the following:
l load a log file up to 200MB in size 
l search and filter messages in the Log View 
l detect syslog headers in log file 
l create and reuse tokens 
l build a token repository 
l construct token filters from tokensl construct token filters from tokens 
l use a different log file from the device to work on base regex and token filters 
l override the token regex or use the original token regex depending on the token filter l change a token or token filter property in one place and having it applied globally l switch to token filter edit mode from different places in the tooll export token filter test results to files for further analysis
Quick Flex Parser Tool provides the following features to help you analyze the log file and track your progress:
l message highlighting in the Base Regex and Token Filter Managers to indicate whether tokens are 	parsing the log lines successfully 
l message highlighting in the Log View to indicate if lines are parsed successfully and whether a 	particular message is being parsed by multiple token filtersl graphical statistics in the Log View to track your progress in analyzing the log file 
l tests you can run to detect whether the parsing you defined makes sense; you can drill down into the 	test results to determine why a test might have failed

Parser Tool Workflow SummaryUser Guide
Parser Tool Workflow Summary
The following tasks provide a high-level description of how to use Quick Flex Parser Tool to create a parser file, suitable for the FlexConnector framework.
1. Create a parser file project1. Create a parser file project
Quick Flex Parser Tool creates parser files within the context of a project. The project contains the definitions of your tokens, base regex, token filters and mappings based on the content of a log file. When you create a project you load the log file and identify the folder to store your results. See "Creating and Opening Parser Projects".
2. Create the base regex2. Create the base regex
The base regex (also known as a preparser) is used to process headers from all messages in a file or stream. The base regex is a regular expression which corresponds to the regex in the connector parser file.
The base regex must match all log lines in a file. Base regex provides the opportunity to further refine message processing defining message token filters. Edit the base regex until all messages are processed. See "Create a Base Regex".3. Create tokens and token filters
Create tokens based on the content of the message. A token is a tag that identifies a data field or other useful information in a message. Verify that the tokens work for all of the specified messages. Use the tokens to build a token filter. A token filter is the tokenized form of a message or log record. See "Create a Token", "Create a Token Filter", and "Override Token Regex".4. Test the token filtersTest log lines against the token filters. The goal is to see if the parsing makes sense or if the matching against the log lines works. The log lines are parsed by a combination of the base regex and token filters. Ideally, each log line should be matched by only one token filter. If the log line is matched by more than one token filter, then you should resolve this situation. Create token filters as needed by using existing tokens or creating new tokens. The Quick Flex Parser Tool uses highlighting in the Log View to identify portions of the log line that are matched by the base regex and by the token filters. The Log View also identifies lines that match the token filter, do not match the token filter, or are matched by multiple token filters. See "Quick Flex Parser Tool Log View", "Highlighting Patterns in Log Lines", and "Managing and Testing Token Filters".5. Generate the parser properties file
Generate the parser properties file based on the tokens, base regex, token filters and mappings you created. This file can be imported into the FlexConnector framework. See "Generate a Parser File ".

About:
Parser file projects:About:
Parser file projects:
Quick Flex Parser Tool creates a parser file within the scope of a project. The project contains the definitions of your tokens, token filters, and their respective mappings based on the content of a log file. The result of the project is a .properties file that is suitable for parsing the content of a log file within the 
FlexConnector framework.
Procedure:FlexConnector framework.
Procedure:
Create a new project:
1. Click Create New on the Landing Page to open the New Project dialog. 2. Select the Parser Project to create a parser file project .
3. Enter the following information in the Create New Project page: 	l the name of the vendor who provided the log file
l (Optional) the name of the product that produced the log file
l (Optional) the version number of the productNote: The vendor and product names defined are mapped automatically to their
corresponding fields.
If you do not specify these details at the beginning of a project, you can specify them later by selecting File>Edit Project Properties in the Log View.
4. For Parser projects: select Syslog File if you are working with a syslog log file. 5. (Optional) Click Browse to navigate to the log file.Micro Focus Quick Flex Parser Tool (1.1)

User Guide 
Chapter 2: Creating and Opening Parser Projects
If you do not select a log file at the beginning of a project, you can select it later by selecting File>Open Log File in the Log View.
For parser file projects only: 
l Comments and empty log lines can be left in the log file that gets uploaded. The Quick FlexParser Tool identifies these lines and displays them, but does not count them towards the total
log lines, as they do not need to be parsed. You can view the comments in the Incomplete tab
if you are interested.
l Select the Parser Project checkbox and leave the Syslog File checkbox on to acknowledge
that the log file has Syslog Header before loading it into the tool.l The limitation on the size of log files for parser files projects is 200 Mb.
6. Click Browse to navigate to the location where you want to store your project artifacts.
7. Click Create. The log file is loaded into the Log View.
A JSONproject file is created. The name of the file is a concatenation of a prefix to indicate whether the file belongs to a parser file or a CEF verification project (pt or cef), the vendor name, the product name, and the version number (prefix_vendor_product_version.json). For example, cef_vendorXYZ_productABC_1.json or pt_vendorUVW_productDEF_1.json.
Open a Parser Project
Navigation: Log View>File>Open Project
Select File>Open Project and select the name of the project. The log file and any associated project artifacts are loaded into the Quick Flex Parser Tool. Quick Flex Parser Tool project names have the format .json.Note: Each project file contains a path pointing to the location of the log file. If Quick Flex Parser Tool
