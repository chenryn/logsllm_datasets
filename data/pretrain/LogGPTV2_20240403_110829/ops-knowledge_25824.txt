User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题This network location can't be included because it is not indexed We are in the process of migrating a bunch of users' home directories onto a new server running Windows Storage Server 2008 R2.

For most users, this has gone well and our group policy has done its job in redirecting users' My Documents folders to their new network path (\\server\Users\%username%\Work).

The problem is, on a small number of Windows 7 PCs, the Documents library isn't automatically adding the users' redirected My Documents path as it does on other PCs.  And when I try to manually correct this by adding the path myself, I get the message "This network location can't be included because it is not indexed."

Windows Search Service is installed onto the server and the Users directory has indexing enabled, so as far as I can tell, the network location IS indexed.

Even if I manually work around the issue and get the users' home directory included in the Documents library, Windows persists in telling me that "Some library features are unavailable due to unsupported library locations".

Assistant: In order for the Windows Search Service to be able to index a folder/share, the local SYSTEM account requires NTFS permissions on the server.

After setting these permissions, group policy was able to add the users' home shares to the Documents library and I was able to do this manually myself without the message, "This network location can't be included because it is not indexed."

Wouldn't it be nice if an error was logged in the System event log to let me know that Windows Search Service doesn't have the permissions it needs to index a folder?
