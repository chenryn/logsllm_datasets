Was The Legacy BIOS.. 
Legacy BIOS 
1.

2.
Basic CPU, chipset initialization  
3.
Initialize Cache-as-RAM, load and run from cache  
4.
Initialize DIMMs, create address map..  
5.
Enumerate PCIe devices..  
6.
Execute Option ROMs on expansion cards  
7.
Load and execute MBR  
8.
2nd Stage Boot Loader  OS Loader  OS kernel

SPI Flash Write Protection 
• Often still not properly enabled on many systems 
• SMM based write protection of entire BIOS region is often not used: 
BIOS_CONTROL[SMM_BWP] 
• If SPI Protected Ranges (mode agnostic) are used (defined by PR0-
PR4 in SPI MMIO), they often don’t cover entire BIOS & NVRAM 
• Some platforms use SPI device specific WP protection but only for 
boot block/startup code or SPI Flash descriptor region 
• Persistent BIOS Infection (used coreboot’s flashrom on legacy BIOS) 
• Evil Maid Just Got Angrier: Why FDE with TPM is Not Secure on Many Systems 
• BIOS Chronomancy: Fixing the Static Root of Trust for Measurement 
• A Tale Of One Software Bypass Of Windows 8 Secure Boot 
• Mitigation:  BIOS_CONTROL[SMM_BWP] = 1 and SPI PRx

• Or Copernicus from MITRE

Demo 
(Insecure SPI Flash Protection) 
From Analytics, and Scalability, and UEFI Exploitation by Teddy Reed 
Patch enables BIOS write protection (sets BIOS_CONTROL[BLE]). Picked up by 
Subzero. The fix is incomplete though  
SPI Flash Write Protection 
• Some systems write-protect BIOS by disabling BIOS Write-Enable 
(BIOSWE) and setting BIOS Lock Enable (BLE) but don’t use SMM 
based write-protection BIOS_CONTROL[SMM_BWP] 
• SMI event is generated when Update SW writes BIOSWE=1 
• Possible attack against this configuration is to block SMI events 
• E.g. disable all chipset sources of SMI: clear SMI_EN[GBL_SMI_EN] if 
BIOS didn’t lock SMI config: Setup for Failure: Defeating SecureBoot 
• Another variant is to disable specific TCO SMI source used for 
BIOSWE/BLE (clear SMI_EN[TCO_EN] if BIOS didn’t lock TCO config.) 
• Mitigation:  BIOS_CONTROL[SMM_BWP] = 1 and lock SMI config 
•chipsec_main --module common.bios_smi 
SMI Suppression Attack Variants 
SPI Flash Write Protection 
• Some BIOS rely on SPI Protected Range (PR0-PR4 registers in SPI 
MMIO) to provide write protection of regions of SPI Flash 
• SPI Flash Controller configuration including PRx has to be locked 
down by BIOS via Flash Lockdown 
• If BIOS doesn’t lock SPI Controller configuration (by setting 
FLOCKDN bit in HSFSTS SPI MMIO register), malware can disable 
SPI protected ranges re-enabling write access to SPI Flash

Legacy BIOS Update and Secure Boot 
• Mebromi malware includes BIOS infector & MBR bootkit 
components 
• Patches BIOS ROM binary injecting malicious ISA Option 
ROM with legitimate BIOS image mod utility 
• Triggers SW SMI 0x29/0x2F to erase SPI flash then write 
patched BIOS binary 
• chipsec_util smi 0x29 0x0 
Signed BIOS Updates Are Rare 
• No concept of Secure or Verified Boot 
• Wonder why TDL4 and likes flourished? 
No Signature Checks of OS boot loaders (MBR) 
UEFI BIOS Update Problems 
• Unsigned sections within BIOS update (e.g. boot splash 
logo BMP image) 
• BIOS displayed the logo before SPI Flash write-
protection was enabled 
• EDK ConvertBmpToGopBlt() integer overflow followed by 
memory corruption during DXE while parsing BMP image 
• Copy loop overwrote #PF handler and triggered #PF 
• Attacking Intel BIOS 
Parsing of Unsigned BMP Image in UEFI FW Update Binary 
UEFI BIOS Update Problems 
• Legacy BIOS with signed BIOS update 
• OS schedules BIOS update placing new BIOS image in 
DRAM split into RBU packets 
• Upon reboot, BIOS Update SMI Handler reconstructs BIOS 
image from RBU packets in SMRAM and verifies signature 
• Buffer overflow (memcpy with controlled size/dest/src) 
when copying RBU packet to a buffer with reconstructed 
BIOS image 
• BIOS Chronomancy: Fixing the Core Root of Trust for Measurement 
• Defeating Signed BIOS Enforcement

Problems With HW Configuration/Protections 
• D_LCK bit locks down Compatible SMM space (a.k.a. CSEG) 
configuration (SMRAMC) 
• SMRAMC[D_OPEN]=0 forces access to legacy SMM space 
decode to system bus rather than to DRAM where SMI 
handlers are when CPU is not in System Management 
Mode (SMM) 
• When D_LCK is not set by BIOS, SMM space decode can be 
changed to open access to CSEG when CPU is not in SMM: 
Using CPU SMM to Circumvent OS Security Functions 
• Also Using SMM For Other Purposes 
• chipsec_main –-module common.smm

Problems With HW Configuration/Protections 
• CPU executes from cache if memory type is cacheable 
• Ring0 exploit can make SMRAM cacheable (variable MTRR) 
• Ring0 exploit can then populate cache-lines at SMBASE with 
SMI exploit code (ex. modify SMBASE) and trigger SMI 
• CPU upon entering SMM will execute SMI exploit from cache 
• Attacking SMM Memory via Intel Cache Poisoning 
• Getting Into the SMRAM: SMM Reloaded 
• CPU System Management Range Registers (SMRR) forcing UC 
and blocking access to SMRAM when CPU is not in SMM 
• BIOS has to enable SMRR

Problems With HW Configuration/Protections 
• Remap Window is used to reclaim DRAM range below 4Gb 
“lost” for Low MMIO 
• Defined by REMAPBASE/REMAPLIMIT registers in Memory 
Controller PCIe config. space 
• MC remaps Reclaim Window access to DRAM below 4GB 
(above “Top Of Low DRAM”) 
• If not locked, OS malware can reprogram target of reclaim 
to overlap with SMRAM 
• Preventing & Detecting Xen Hypervisor Subversions 
• BIOS has to lock down Memory Map registers including 
REMAP*, TOLUD/TOUUD

Problems With HW Configuration/Protections 
• “Top Swap” feature allows fault-tolerant update of BIOS boot block 
• Enabled by BUC[TS] in Root Complex MMIO range 
• When enabled, chipset flips A16-A20 address bits (depending on the 
size of boot block) when CPU fetches reset vector on reboot 
• Thus CPU executes from 0xFFFEFFF0 inside “backup” boot block 
rather than from 0xFFFFFFF0 
• What if malware enables Top Swap? 
• BIOS Boot Hijacking and VMware Vulnerabilities Digging 
• BIOS has to lock down Top Swap configuration (BIOS Interface Lock in 
General Control & Status register) & protect top swap range in SPI 
• chipsec_main --module common.bios_ts
