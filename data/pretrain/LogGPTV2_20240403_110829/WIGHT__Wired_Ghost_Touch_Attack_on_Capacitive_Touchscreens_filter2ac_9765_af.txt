A. EXPERIMENT RISKS AND PROTECTION METHODS
APPENDIX
Before conducting the trial, we inform the participants with
the following information: the background and signiﬁcance
of our research, eligibility criteria, experimental design and
methods, allowance and compensation, the potential risks, and
preventive measures. In addition, the participants can terminate
the trial at any time.
Experiment Procedures. The detailed experiment proce-
dures for participants are as follow. (1) First, check the
environment of the charging station, plug in the phone, and
place it on the table; (2) Then,
tap the button according
to the popup prompt, and repeat 4 trials; (3) After each
trial, participants are required to ﬁll in a questionnaire about
whether the target button is clicked successfully. The whole
experiment lasts about 5 minutes, and each participant will
earn $8 for the experiment.
i.e.,
injecting ghost
touches. During the test,
Informed Risks. Our experiments require participants to
press a button in two scenarios: without attacks and with
attacks,
the
participants may have a subtle sensation when they tap the
button due to a static buildup on the touchscreen. To reduce
such likelihood, we have used a copper plate to absorb the
static electricity by contacting the touchscreen after each trial.
Additionally, in a rare and extreme case, the participant may
experience a momentary electric shock if he/she holds the
metal frame of the phone and the ground simultaneously. To
protect the participants, we have 3 protection mechanisms:
(1) Limit
the pulse duration to be less than 2ms so that
the current ﬂows into the human body will be less than
the safety boundary if the circuit ever shorts. (2) Install a
current-limitation fuse. (3) We request participants to place
the phone on the table and do not pick up the phone during
the experiment.
B. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
We have informed the product security teams about the
vulnerability reported in this paper, including the vulnerable
products, a detailed description of the vulnerability, and proof
of concept. In addition, we also introduced the experimental
steps so that they can reproduce a simple version of the attack.
What’s more, we provided our expected correct behavior and
workaround.
C. FORMULA DERIVATION FOR SIGNAL TRANSMISSION
As introduced in Sec. IV-A, let Vcm T X and Vcm RX be the
potential of TX and RX that are caused by the injected CM
signal respectively.
