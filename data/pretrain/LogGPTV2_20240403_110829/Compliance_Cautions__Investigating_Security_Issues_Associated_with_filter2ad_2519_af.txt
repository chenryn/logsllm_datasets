compliance standards, as well as how a broader range of
compliance standards are applied in real-world environments.
Drawing on common themes identiﬁed across standards, re-
searchers could design guidelines or even templates for avoid-
ing common issues when writing standards.

sheet: (1) all of the data that external experts validated, (2)
all IRS P1075 ﬁndings, (3) all PCI DSS ﬁndings, (4) all

APPENDIX B
EXPERT SURVEY
Participant is presented with consent form; Please check all
that apply (you may choose any number of these statements):
I am age 18 or older; I have read this consent form or had it
read to me; I voluntarily agree to participate in this research
and I want to continue to the survey.
Introduction: This survey will ask for you to assess the validity
of an independent evaluation of [standard name]. Please be as
candid and detailed as possible.
For each issue, please conﬁrm:
1)
2)
3)
4)
5)
6)
If your organization followed the standard as written
and nothing else, would your organization be vulner-
able to this issue? (Yes/No/Possibly)
If yes or possibly ⇒ In your opinion, what is the
likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited if
standard is followed as written and nothing else?
(Frequent - Occurs often, continuously experienced;
Likely - Occurs several times; Occasional - Occurs
sporadically; Seldom - Unlikely, but could occur at
some time; Unlikely - Can assume it will not occur)
If yes or possibly ⇒ In your opinion, what is the
severity associated with exploitation if standard is
followed as written and nothing else? (Catastrophic
- Complete system loss, major property damage,
full data breach, corruption of all data; Critical -
Major system damage, signiﬁcant property damage,
signiﬁcant data breach, corruption of sensitive data;
Moderate - Minor system damage, minor property
damage, partial data breach; Negligible - Minor sys-
tem impairment)
If yes or possibly ⇒ Is there past evidence of this vul-
nerability within your organization? (Yes/No/Maybe)
If yes or possibly ⇒ What would you recommend,
based on your experience,
to remedy this issue?
(Open response)
If no ⇒ What additional policies, procedures, or
defensive techniques does your organization use to
mitigate this issue? (Open response)
End of survey: Does your organization allow waivers to the
compliance standard? If yes, how frequently are they used? If
no, does frequently does this create issues for your organiza-
tion?
Demographics: What is the highest level of school you have
completed or the highest degree you have received? Please
estimate the number of years experience you have in the
compliance and information technology ﬁelds. Please describe
your work role and your interaction with compliance standards.
Please estimate the organization size that you work in.
