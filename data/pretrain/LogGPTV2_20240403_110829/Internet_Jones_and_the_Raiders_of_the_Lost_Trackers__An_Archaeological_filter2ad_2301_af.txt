A Fingerprint-Related JavaScript APIs
As described in Section 3, TrackingExcavator hooks
a number of JavaScript APIs that may be used in
ﬁngerprint-based tracking and drawn from prior work [3,
4, 15, 56, 57]. The complete list:
• navigator.appCodeName
• navigator.appName
• navigator.appVersion
• navigator.cookieEnabled
• navigator.doNotTrack
• navigator.language
• navigator.languages
• navigator.maxTouchPoints
• navigator.mediaDevices
• navigator.mimeTypes
• navigator.platform
• navigator.plugins
• navigator.product
• navigator.productSub
• navigator.userAgent
• navigator.vendor
• navigator.vendorSub
• screen.availHeight
• screen.availLeft
• screen.availTop
• screen.availWidth
• screen.colorDepth
• screen.height
• screen.orientation
• screen.pixelDepth
• screen.width
• CanvasRenderingContext2D.getImageData
• CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillText
• CanvasRenderingContext2D.strokeText
• WebGLRenderingContext.getImageData
• WebGLRenderingContext.fillText
• WebGLRenderingContext.strokeText
• HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL
• window.TouchEvent
• HTMLElement.offsetHeight
• HTMLElement.offsetWidth
• HTMLElement.getBoundingClientRect
B Ecosystem Complexity
Figure 12 (on the next page) visually depicts the connec-
tions between entities in the tracking ecosystem that we
observe in our datasets for 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012,
and 2016: domains as nodes, and referral relationships as
edges. Note that the visual organization of these graphs
(with nodes in multiple tiers) is not meaningful and sim-
ply an artifact of the graph visualization software. Over
time, the complexity and interconnectedness of relation-
ships between third-party domains on the top 450 web-
sites has increased dramatically.
