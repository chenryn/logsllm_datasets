## Abstract

Mobile offline payment enables transactions even in the absence of reliable network connections. Leading payment service providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, Samsung, Apple) use direct communication channels such as Near-Field Communication (NFC), Magnetic Secure Transmission (MST), audio, and QR codes. Although these solutions include security measures, their implications, especially under unique threats, are not well understood.

In this paper, we report a new type of over-the-counter payment fraud called Synchronized Token Lifting and Spending (STLS). This attack exploits the design flaws in existing schemes, allowing an active attacker to intercept the payment token, disrupt the ongoing transaction, and quickly transmit the token to a colluder for unauthorized use while it is still valid. Our research shows that STLS attacks pose a significant threat to popular offline payment schemes, particularly those designed for backward compatibility, such as Samsung Pay and Alipay.

To mitigate these threats, we propose POSAUTH, a solution that incorporates the unique ID of the current POS terminal into the generation of payment tokens. By requiring a quick scan of a QR code printed on the POS terminal, combined with a short validity period, POSAUTH ensures that tokens generated for one transaction can only be used in that specific transaction.

## 1. Introduction

The widespread adoption of mobile devices has transformed commercial activities, with mobile payment becoming increasingly popular. Leading e-commerce providers and smartphone manufacturers have developed various payment solutions, most of which originally required both parties to be online. However, offline payment schemes, which allow transactions even with unreliable network connections, are gaining traction. These schemes establish a direct connection between the smartphone and the POS system through NFC, Bluetooth, electromagnetic fields, QR codes, or audio signals, and deliver a payment token over this channel.

While many prominent payment schemes now support offline transactions, the security guarantees they provide are less clear. Unlike online payments, where transactions are conducted through a service provider, offline payments rely on direct communication, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping. Although NFC and Bluetooth offer bidirectional interactions and challenge-response mechanisms, cheaper and more backwardly compatible alternatives, such as MST, QR codes, and audio signals, are widely adopted. These channels are inherently one-way, making it difficult to implement secure mutual challenge-response protocols. As a result, these schemes often use one-time payment tokens with a short validity period to defend against eavesdropping. However, this protection is insufficient against an active attacker who can disrupt the transaction and use the token in a different transaction within its validity period.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Mobile Offline Payment

Since 1999, when Ericsson and Telnor mobile phones were first used for purchases, mobile payment has become increasingly popular. A typical mobile payment transaction involves three parties: the payer, the payee, and the payment service provider. Depending on the role of the provider, the transaction can be online or offline. 

#### 2.1.1 Online Payment
In online payment, both the payer and the payee are connected to the Internet, and the transaction is verified by the payment service provider. For example, PayPal, Amazon, and Google's Mobile Wallet require the user to enter a PIN to validate the payment, which is then charged to their account based on the stored credit card information.

#### 2.1.2 Offline Payment
In offline payment, the transaction occurs directly between the payer and the payee, with the provider communicating with only one party. The payer uses a smartphone to establish a communication channel with the POS device and transmits a payment token. This token is generated using a secret in the payer’s digital wallet, the current time, and a challenge from the payee if available. The POS terminal forwards the token and transaction information to the payment service provider for verification.

### 2.2 Security Risks

Offline payment schemes are vulnerable to eavesdropping, particularly when using one-way communication channels like MST, QR codes, and audio signals. While one-time tokens with short validity periods are used to mitigate these risks, they are insufficient against an active attacker who can disrupt the transaction and use the token in a different transaction within its validity period.

## 3. Synchronized Token Lifting and Spending (STLS) Attacks

### 3.1 Samsung Pay
We found that an attacker can intercept the magnetic signals from a Samsung Pay transaction up to 3 meters away using a sensor. The attacker can then jam the wireless signals produced by a mobile POS (mPOS) using a commercial jammer, disrupting the communication with the payment provider. This prevents the token from being delivered and allows the attacker to recover, demodulate, and use the token in a different transaction. After the attack, the jamming stops, allowing the shopper to retry the transaction without suspicion.

### 3.2 Alipay
Alipay supports payment through QR codes and audio signals. An attacker can use a recorder to capture the token transferred through sound and a jammer to disrupt the transaction. The token can then be used for another transaction. In the case of QR code-based payment, a malicious payer device can steal the token from the payee’s screen and force the payee device to refresh, preserving the original token for unauthorized use. Additionally, a malicious app on the payer’s device can halt the transaction by covering a few pixels on the screen when displaying the QR token to the POS machine. The image of the code can also be acquired from the reflection on the glass of the QR scanner’s scan window.

## 4. Mitigation: POSAUTH

To mitigate the newly discovered threats, we propose POSAUTH, a solution that binds the payer’s payment token to a specific POS terminal. Each POS terminal presents a QR code carrying its unique ID. For each transaction, the payer scans the code to generate a payment token bound to the terminal. This binding, combined with a short validity period, ensures that the token can only be used in the current transaction.
