`Deno.readTextFile` error is not too descriptive my opinion:
    error: Uncaught NotFound: No such file or directory (os error 2)
    ...
Maybe it could include a bit more information, like the path it was trying to
read?
    error: Uncaught NotFound: No such file or directory (os error 2): "path/to/file.ts"
