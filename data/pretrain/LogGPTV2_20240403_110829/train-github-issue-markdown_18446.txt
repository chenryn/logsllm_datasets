The error message generated by `Deno.readTextFile` could be more informative. Currently, it appears as follows:

```
error: Uncaught NotFound: No such file or directory (os error 2)
...
```

It would be more helpful if the error message included the specific file path that was attempted to be read. For example:

```
error: Uncaught NotFound: No such file or directory (os error 2): "path/to/file.ts"
```

This additional information would make it easier to diagnose and resolve the issue.
