# ADMIN UI
PWN-RE
## Description:
> The command you just found removed the Foobanizer 9000 from the DMZ. While scanning the network, you find a weird device called Tempo-a-matic. According to a Google search it's a smart home temperature control experience. The management interface looks like a nest of bugs. You also stumble over some gossip on the dark net about bug hunters finding some vulnerabilities and because the vendor didn't have a bug bounty program, they were sold for US$3.49 a piece. Do some black box testing here, it'll go well with your hat.

## Solution:
Connecting to the provided server provides us the following service:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/adminui# nc mngmnt-iface.ctfcompetition.com 1337
=== Management Interface ===
 1) Service access
 2) Read EULA/patch notes
 3) Quit
```
Let's read the release notes:
```
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/adminui# nc mngmnt-iface.ctfcompetition.com 1337
=== Management Interface ===
 1) Service access
 2) Read EULA/patch notes
 3) Quit

The following patchnotes were found:
 - Version0.2
 - Version0.3
Which patchnotes should be shown?
Version0.2
# Release 0.2
 - Updated library X to version 0.Y
 - Fixed path traversal bug
 - Improved the UX
=== Management Interface ===
 1) Service access
 2) Read EULA/patch notes

The following patchnotes were found:
 - Version0.2
 - Version0.3
Which patchnotes should be shown?
Version0.3
# Version 0.3
 - Rollback of version 0.2 because of random reasons

 So version 0.2 fixed a path traversal vulnerability and version 0.3 reverted the fix.
 Let's start looking for a known file:

 We found /etc/password at the following relative path: `../../../etc/passwd`.
 We also can guess that our user's home directory is `/home/user`, based on the last entry of the file.
 From there, we can find the flag with a bit of guessing:
