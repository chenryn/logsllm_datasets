User: I had installed ffmpeg in WIN7 64bit. When I use 
os.system("ffmpeg -i      rtsp://218.204.223.237:554/live/1/66251FC11353191F/e7ooqwcfbqjoo80j.sdp -c copy dump.mp4") in my program by the PyCharm,it can also run but I can`t play the dump.mp4. I can run the same command in CMD or Python(command line) and get the dump.mp4 successfully.Why? How can I solve this problem?Can you help me ? I just use Python not long before.
Assistant: I run python ***.py in the CMD is OK.Should`t run the program in the PyCharm.Perhaps the environment is differnet.
