Assistant: 1. Django Advantages: - Django is a mature, highly customizable web framework that provides a large number of out-of-the-box functions and other packages, such as ORM, forms, validation, etc.; - Django is very secure in terms of security Well, there are many built-in features for data protection and user authentication, such as password hash functions, CSRF protection, etc.; - Django can be seamlessly integrated with many other technologies (such as Nginx, Apache, PostgreSQL, etc.). Plus, Django supports many cloud hosting platforms. Disadvantages: -Django is a relatively heavy web framework that takes some time to learn and debug; -Django's performance is average and may be subject to some restrictions. 2. Flask advantages: - Flask is a lightweight, easy-to-use web framework, completely free to organize itself, and can flexibly respond to small projects; - Flask has excellent documentation and community support; - Flask is easy to customize and fully masters the application Program control. Disadvantages: - Flask's flexibility also means that more effort needs to be paid for many things, such as application structure, security, validation, etc.; - Flask does not contain many functions like Django, and many "external" packages need to be considered for support desired functionality. 3. Ruby on Rails Advantages: - RoR is a mature, full-stack web framework with high productivity, making it easy to build, develop and maintain web applications; - RoR's convention is better than configuration mode, making development Personnel can concentrate more on business logic rather than framework configuration; - RoR has a lot of community support and third-party resources, making it easier to expand and customize. Disadvantages: - Similar to Django, RoR is also a relatively heavy web framework that requires some learning and configuration work for beginners; - RoR's productivity and rapid iteration ability may also be seen as a disadvantage, because it requires more High development velocity may cause code quality issues or performance bottlenecks.
