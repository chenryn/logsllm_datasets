User: When i use python-mode it uses my system (mac python), I have anaconda installed and want Vim to autocomplete etc with that version of python
As it stands now, python-mode will only autocomplete modules in from system python and not any other modules e.g. pandas that is installed in the anaconda distro.
thanx

Assistant: Not trivial.  Python-mode uses the Python interpreter Vim is linked against; you'll have to recompile Vim and link it against Anaconda.
