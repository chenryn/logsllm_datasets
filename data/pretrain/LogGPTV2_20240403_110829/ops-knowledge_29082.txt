User: I need to debug Celery task from the Eclipse debugger.
I'm using Eclipse, PyDev and Django. 
First, I open my project in Eclipse and put a breakpoint at the beginning of the task function. 
Then, I'm starting the Celery workers from Eclipse by Right Clicking on manage.py from the PyDev Package Explorer and choosing "Debug As->Python Run" and specifying "celeryd -l info" as the argument. This starts MainThread, Mediator and three more threads visible from the Eclipse debugger.  
After that I return back to the PyDev view and start the main application by  Right Click on the project and choosing Run As/PyDev:Django
My issues is that once the task is submitted by the mytask.delay()  it doesn't stop on the breakpoint. I put some traces withing the tasks code so I can see that it was executed in one of the worker threads. 
So, how to make the Eclipse debugger to stop on the breakpoint placed withing the task when it executed in the Celery workers thread?
Assistant: I create a management command to test task.. find it easier than running it from shell..
