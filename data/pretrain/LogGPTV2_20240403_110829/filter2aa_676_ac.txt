protection from unlicensed devices operating in the TV bands, even without a 
requirement to stay off a channel for a particular period of time—as devices still will be 
required to confirm that a channel is unoccupied at the commencement of operation and 
to periodically monitor that channel for use by incumbent licensees.33   
Adjacent Channel Interference - The Commission has recognized that low power 
personal/portable devices are not likely to pose an interference problem when operating

in channels adjacent to channels occupied by TV signals.34  Nevertheless, the 
Commission seeks comment on the need for adjacent channel sensing by such devices.35  
Although the potential for harmful adjacent channel interference by low power 
personal/portable devices operating within the parameters proposed herein is small, the 
Coalition is not opposed to some measures to provide a greater degree of confidence that 
incumbent licensees will not face harmful interference.  The Coalition plans to utilize 
TPC combined with over-the-air sensing to achieve Commission-mandated adjacent 
channel D/U (desired to undesired) signal ratios, and is confident that Commission 
testing of the Coalition’s prototype will verify that this approach is more than adequate to 
project incumbent licensees on adjacent channels.  
The Coalition’s own testing strongly suggests that the FCC laboratory will be able 
to confirm that an outright ban on adjacent channel usage by low power devices is not 
necessary or advisable, and will serve only to create an artificial scarcity of white spaces 
in congested areas.  The ability to offer devices that will work in both urban and rural 
areas will create a substantially more robust market—with resulting economies of scale 
and scope—than would a market made up of devices that could operate only in rural 
areas.          
Sensing bandwidth - The Commission also has inquired as to whether it should 
specify a particular minimum sensing bandwidth in addition to the detection threshold.36  
34  NPRM ¶ 30 (“We … believe that the requirements needed to protect television service from digital 
unlicensed devices should be limited to co- and adjacent channel operations only for fixed/access 
operations and co-channel operations only for personal/portable operations.”). 
35  FNPRM ¶ 42.

It should not.  Consistent with the Coalition’s view that the Commission should mandate 
performance requirements rather than specific implementation schemes, industry should 
be allowed to determine the implementation that works best for each device.  In this way, 
the Commission can ensure that innovative approaches to interference avoidance are not 
stifled by “one size fits all” implementation requirements. 
Antenna Requirements - The Commission has proposed the use of an omni-
directional antenna with a gain of 0 dBi (unity gain) for sensing, and asks what 
considerations need to be taken into account if devices use a gain antenna for 
transmitting.37  As noted above, the Coalition is not opposed to a requirement that both 
receive and transmit antennas have a maximum gain of 0 dBi, which will provide further 
assurances that incumbent licensees will be protected from harmful interference.     
The Commission also asks whether it should establish minimum transmit height antenna 
requirements or require reduction in power when antennas are above a certain height.38  
The Coalition believes that, for personal/portable devices, height restrictions should not 
be imposed since they would be impossible to administer and are unnecessary given the 
low power (below 100 mW EIRP) at which these devices would operate.  However, the 
Coalition recommends that devices should not have antennas that can be removed by the 
consumer, and that consumers should not be permitted to connect devices to separate 
external antennas.  
Spectrum Sharing - The Coalition applauds the Commission’s recognition that 
industry has the capability to develop standards and protocols that will facilitate sharing 
37  Id. ¶ 44.   
38  Id. 
17
of TV white spaces.39  However, the Coalition also agrees with the Commission that the 
ability of a single device or network to monopolize a particular channel or geographic 
area would dramatically decrease the usefulness of these bands.40  Thus, the Coalition is 
not opposed to a minimal regulatory requirement to ensure spectrum sharing among 
devices.  Specifically, the Coalition proposes a maximum channel occupancy time of 400 
milliseconds, to be followed by a minimum 100 microsecond interval during which the 
device may not transmit on the previously vacated channel.  Because this restriction will 
be more than sufficient to ensure that one device does not monopolize a particular 
channel, the Commission should not impose additional restrictions, such as prohibiting 
simultaneous transmission on more than one channel, on unlicensed devices.   
Distributed Sensing – Finally, the Commission has inquired about the possibility 
of implementing a requirement that TV band devices share channel availability 
information (“distributed sensing”) to reduce the threat of harmful interference.41  As 
discussed above, the Coalition has determined that a detection threshold of -114 dBm is 
more than sufficient to protect incumbent licensees.  While the availability of distributed 
sensing presumably would allow the operation of devices with a less conservative 
detection threshold, the Coalition believes that the best approach would be to require all 
devices to operate at -114 dBm to ensure operation even in instances where channel 
availability information from other unlicensed devices may be unavailable.

Testing. 
The Coalition enthusiastically endorses the Commission’s commitment to 
perform lab testing to determine the true potential for harmful interference to incumbent 
licensees by devices operating in the TV white spaces.42  Rules for operation in TV white 
spaces should be guided by how actual prototype devices perform in a series of objective 
and unbiased tests, rather than on speculation fueled by experiments based on devices 
that no one plans to build with RF outputs designed to maximize interference.  The 
Coalition already has responded to the invitation of the Office of Engineering and 
Technology to submit a prototype TV band device for testing,43 and will provide a 
prototype in the near future.    
It is the Coalition’s belief that the Commission’s testing will confirm that the 
proposed device will protect incumbent licensees from harmful interference, and that 
personal/portable devices utilizing spectrum sensing are a viable approach that not only 
should be permitted, but encouraged.  If requested to do so, the Coalition stands ready to 
provide the Commission with qualified engineers to aid in the testing under Commission 
supervision and be available to answer questions concerning the prototype device. 
II. 
THE COMMISSION SHOULD NOT IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON 
PERSONAL/PORTABLE UNLICENSED DEVICES.  
Although the Commission’s initial Notice proposed using different interference 
avoidance mechanisms for fixed/access and personal/portable unlicensed devices, the 
Commission recognized in the Further Notice that certain interference avoidance 
42  Id. ¶ 3.   
43  See Public Notice:  Office of Engineering and Technology Invites Submittal of Prototype TV Band 
Devices for Testing, DA 06-2571 (rel. Dec. 21, 2006).   
19
schemes could be employed for both fixed and personal/portable devices.44  While the 
Commission has expressed concern that personal/portable devices could present a greater 
threat of harmful interference and interfering devices could be more difficult to locate,45 
these concerns—even if valid—are more than offset by the much lower power at which 
personal/portable devices operate.  More fundamentally, however, the Commission can 
alleviate harmful interference concerns by setting the underlying performance criteria it 
expects the devices to meet, and then allowing industry to implement the means to meet 
those criteria.  As set forth in greater detail above, the spectrum sensing approach works 
for personal/portable devices, and the Coalition is confident that the Commission’s 
independent tests will confirm these results.   
The Coalition is particularly concerned that the Commission’s initial 
determination to permit the use of fixed devices, but to seek further comment on 
personal/portable devices,46 could presage delays in authorizing—or even failure to 
authorize—the use of such devices.  Failure to authorize personal/portable devices would 
be a major blow to U.S. competitiveness and the nation’s consumers.  Fixed devices can 
only be deployed if there is a service provider willing to invest in base station 
infrastructure and lease locations to situate base stations.  In addition, as envisioned by 
the Commission, fixed devices must avoid adjacent channel operations, excluding access 
to significant amounts of spectrum in congested urban areas.    
44  FNPRM ¶ 25.   
45  Id. ¶ 18. 
46  Id. ¶ 2. 
20
These requirements will at best delay implementation and add significant 
unnecessary costs, increasing the likelihood that service providers will deploy 
infrastructure only in the most lucrative markets—once again depriving rural America of 
advances in broadband technology.  In addition, the devices themselves will be much 
more expensive; the relatively limited deployment that a fixed requirement entails would 
create a far smaller market, thus limiting economies of scale and scope.  Perhaps most 
importantly, the increased cost to consumers and the limited market would cause 
manufactures to reassess whether they should enter this market at all.   
Delaying the eventual authorization of personal/portable unlicensed devices 
would also be a serious mistake.  The Coalition fully endorses the Commission’s 
commitment to allow the sale of TV band devices as of February 17, 2009, 47 and 
strongly urges the Commission not to change this date even in the unlikely event that the 
DTV transition is delayed.  The Coalition has a personal/portable prototype specifically 
developed for the TV bands available today, and has solid roadmaps for delivery of 
innovative TV band unlicensed devices in the near term.  Any concerns that the 
Commission has that may require further study and analysis are best accomplished now, 
while the Coalition and various other companies are eager to commit resources to help.  
Continuing to postpone a ripe decision (as the Commission has for the last two years) 
will inevitably drive domestic industry resources away from the TV white spaces.  The 
time for the Commission to act is now—so that consumers can enjoy innovative products, 
and the U.S. can take the competitive lead in this space.

III. 
THE WHITE SPACES SHOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR UNLICENSED USE.   
A. 
White Spaces are Ill-Suited for Deployment of Licensed Services.   
As the Commission has observed, allocating spectrum via license is appropriate 
when spectrum rights are (1) clearly defined; (2) exclusive; (3) flexible; and (4) 
transferable. 48  Spectrum rights lacking these attributes are more efficiently allocated 
through unlicensed operation.49  The Further Notice provides ample evidence that the TV 
white spaces do not meet the Commission’s criteria for licensed operation.  Most 
significantly, a licensing regime will not lessen any of the obligations that would be 
imposed on devices under an unlicensed model.  Devices still must transmit at lower 
power than typical licensed use, deploy a reliable means of determining whether a 
channel is in use by an incumbent licensee, and cease operation in cases where that 
spectrum is or becomes occupied by a licensee with a higher authorization.50  Such 
restrictions are not imposed on licensed use as a matter of course, and the Commission is 
therefore right to be concerned that “Unlicensed operations may … be better able to 
dynamically adapt to a shifting spectrum environment characterized by low power 
operation.”51  The Coalition concurs with the Commission; unlicensed operations are 
better able to adapt to a shifting spectrum environment, and thus are the appropriate use 
for the TV white spaces. 
48  Id. ¶ 27.   
49  Id. ¶ 27.   
50  See id. ¶ 28.   
51  Id. ¶ 29. 
22
The fact that the “Swiss cheese” patterns of available TV white space spectrum 
are impractical to license is perhaps best illustrated by the Commission’s proposed 
channel re-check requirements.  Devices must monitor spectrum because their “right” to 
transmit on a particular channel can be foreclosed at any time (for instance when a 
licensed wireless microphone commences operation), a situation that stands in stark 
contrast to the certainty typically afforded by a license.52  Moreover, TV band devices 
must implement power limits and other inflexible restrictions, and the ability to transmit 
is contingent on the unpredictable actions of others, including incumbent users with 
higher status (such as licensed wireless microphones).  What happens, for example, to a 
TV white space licensee if the Commission decides to license a wireless microphone 
operator or another broadcaster within the territory of that white space licensee?  TV 
band allocations do and will change, and it is hard to envision that any party would bid 
aggressively for a license filled with such restrictions and uncertainties. 
Finally, the Commission asks briefly whether it should consider a non-exclusive 
licensing model.53  It should not.  The Commission began this proceeding with the 
recognition that the “significant growth of and consumer demand for unlicensed wireless 
broadband applications” supported opening up the white spaces for unlicensed use.54  
Attempting to meet that demand by issuing a substantial number of non-exclusive 
licenses would impose significant burdens and expense on applicants as well as the 
52  As the Commission has recognized, the amount of available spectrum not only varies dramatically 
based on geography, but also could be subject to change at a given time within a particular location. Id.

23
Commission, with no offsetting benefit.  The Coalition urges the Commission to reject a 
non-exclusive licensing model, which would amount to nothing more than an 
unnecessary registration requirement for white space use.   
B. 
Unlicensed Use of White Spaces Will Provide Substantial Benefits. 
Even if the Commission were to successfully allocate TV white space spectrum to 
a handful of licensees, the case for unlicensed use of white spaces is far more 
compelling—particularly since the Commission will soon license more unencumbered 
700 MHz spectrum in the DTV transition auctions.  Before the advent of unlicensed Wi-
Fi, the 2.4 GHz band was widely derided as a “junk band.”  Yet use of Wi-Fi created a 
multi-billion dollar industry at a time when most telecommunications businesses were in 
a downturn, almost indisputably creating substantially greater value than if the band had 
been allocated for exclusive use.55  At last count, over one billion devices have been 
deployed in the 2.4 GHz band alone.56  
The superior propagation characteristics of TV channels promise not only to 
replicate the success of unlicensed Wi-Fi deployments, but to outshine it.  Unlicensed 
devices operating in the TV band will offer longer transmission ranges using the same 
power, less risk of signal attenuation or harmful interference, and less power 
consumption at the same range as Wi-Fi.57
