### Protection from Unlicensed Devices in TV Bands

Unlicensed devices operating in the TV bands must ensure that a channel is unoccupied before initiating transmission and must periodically monitor the channel for use by incumbent licensees. This requirement helps protect against interference, even without a specific mandate to remain off a channel for a set period.

#### Adjacent Channel Interference
The Commission has acknowledged that low-power personal/portable devices are unlikely to cause significant interference when operating on channels adjacent to those used by TV signals. However, the Commission is seeking comments on whether these devices should be required to perform adjacent channel sensing. The Coalition supports measures to ensure that incumbent licensees are protected from harmful interference. They plan to use Transmit Power Control (TPC) combined with over-the-air sensing to achieve the required Desired to Undesired (D/U) signal ratios. The Coalition's testing suggests that an outright ban on adjacent channel usage is unnecessary and would create an artificial scarcity of white spaces, particularly in congested areas. Allowing devices to operate in both urban and rural areas will foster a more robust market with greater economies of scale and scope.

#### Sensing Bandwidth
The Commission is considering specifying a minimum sensing bandwidth in addition to the detection threshold. The Coalition believes that the Commission should focus on performance requirements rather than specific implementation schemes, allowing industry to determine the best approach for each device. This flexibility will encourage innovation and avoid stifling progress with "one size fits all" requirements.

#### Antenna Requirements
The Commission has proposed using an omni-directional antenna with a gain of 0 dBi (unity gain) for sensing and is seeking input on the implications of using gain antennas for transmitting. The Coalition supports a requirement that both receive and transmit antennas have a maximum gain of 0 dBi to further protect incumbent licensees from harmful interference. For personal/portable devices, the Coalition recommends against imposing height restrictions, as these devices operate at very low power (below 100 mW EIRP). Additionally, the Coalition suggests that devices should not have removable antennas and that consumers should not be allowed to connect external antennas.

#### Spectrum Sharing
The Coalition commends the Commission's recognition of the industry's capability to develop standards and protocols for sharing TV white spaces. To prevent a single device or network from monopolizing a particular channel or geographic area, the Coalition proposes a maximum channel occupancy time of 400 milliseconds, followed by a 100-microsecond interval during which the device may not transmit on the previously vacated channel. This restriction should be sufficient to ensure fair spectrum sharing, and the Commission should not impose additional restrictions such as prohibiting simultaneous transmission on more than one channel.

#### Distributed Sensing
The Commission is also considering the possibility of requiring TV band devices to share channel availability information ("distributed sensing") to reduce the threat of harmful interference. The Coalition believes that a detection threshold of -114 dBm is sufficient to protect incumbent licensees. While distributed sensing could allow for less conservative detection thresholds, the Coalition recommends maintaining the -114 dBm threshold to ensure reliable operation even if channel availability information from other unlicensed devices is unavailable.

### Testing
The Coalition fully supports the Commission's commitment to lab testing to determine the potential for harmful interference to incumbent licensees by devices operating in the TV white spaces. Rules should be based on the performance of actual prototype devices rather than on speculative experiments. The Coalition has already responded to the Office of Engineering and Technology's invitation to submit a prototype TV band device for testing and will provide a prototype soon. The Coalition is confident that the Commission's testing will confirm that their proposed device will protect incumbent licensees and that personal/portable devices using spectrum sensing are a viable and beneficial approach. The Coalition is ready to provide qualified engineers to assist with the testing under Commission supervision.

### Recommendations
The Commission should not impose additional restrictions on personal/portable unlicensed devices. While the Commission initially proposed different interference avoidance mechanisms for fixed/access and personal/portable devices, it recognized that certain schemes could be employed for both. The much lower power at which personal/portable devices operate mitigates concerns about harmful interference. The Coalition is concerned that delays in authorizing personal/portable devices could harm U.S. competitiveness and consumer access. Fixed devices require significant infrastructure investment and exclude access to substantial amounts of spectrum in congested urban areas. Personal/portable devices, on the other hand, can be deployed more widely and affordably, benefiting both urban and rural areas.

### White Spaces for Unlicensed Use
The Coalition strongly advocates for allocating the white spaces for unlicensed use. Licensed spectrum allocation is appropriate when rights are clearly defined, exclusive, flexible, and transferable. The TV white spaces do not meet these criteria due to the need for dynamic adaptation to a shifting spectrum environment. The "Swiss cheese" pattern of available TV white space spectrum makes licensing impractical, as devices must continuously monitor and adapt to changes in spectrum usage. The Commission should reject non-exclusive licensing models, which would add unnecessary burdens and expenses without providing any offsetting benefits.

### Benefits of Unlicensed Use
Unlicensed use of white spaces promises substantial benefits, as demonstrated by the success of Wi-Fi in the 2.4 GHz band. The superior propagation characteristics of TV channels offer longer transmission ranges, reduced signal attenuation, and lower power consumption compared to Wi-Fi. Unlicensed devices in the TV band can replicate and even surpass the success of Wi-Fi, creating significant economic value and driving innovation.
