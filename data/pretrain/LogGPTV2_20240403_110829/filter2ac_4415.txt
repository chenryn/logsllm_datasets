**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Hidden Window

Adversaries may employ hidden windows to conceal malicious activities from users. Typically, when an application performs an operation, it displays a window to provide visual feedback or request user input. However, adversaries can manipulate these operations to prevent the window from being displayed, thus hiding their actions. 

This technique can also be used by system administrators for legitimate purposes, such as avoiding disruptions to the user's work environment while performing administrative tasks. By hiding these windows, administrators can carry out necessary operations without interrupting the user's workflow.
