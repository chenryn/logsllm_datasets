### D. Key Extraction with Unknown Register Locations

In the second scenario, we targeted a d + 1 = 2-share implementation of AES-DOM. We adjusted the size of the logic blocks to ensure that nearly all 16 registers in each Logic Array Block (LAB) were utilized, resulting in a total of 45 LABs. These LABs encompass the entire register set of the AES-DOM design, including shared key registers, shared state registers, intermediate masked Sbox registers, and finite-state machine registers. However, we did not have any prior knowledge of the exact location of each register cell and did not enforce any additional placement rules beyond the described configuration.

Using the method outlined in Section IV-B1, we localized the physical area on the chip where the register cells are placed, as illustrated in Figure 6. We then investigated the design architecture of the AES-DOM, which is serialized with the state and key registers shifted byte-wise, as previously mentioned. Table I shows the content of 32 registers (each consisting of 8 bits) over the first 36 clock cycles. The order of the rows in the table is not significant for our analysis.

To conduct the attack, we first...

| 0     | -          | -          | -          | ... | -            |

| 36    | ...        | ...        | ...        | ... | ...          |

- **K**: Key Bytes
- **S**: SubBytes Output
- **M**: MixColumns Output
- **K'**: 2nd Round Key Bytes
- **S'**: 2nd-Round SubByte Output

The table provides a detailed view of the state of the registers during the initial 36 clock cycles. Each row represents the content of a single register byte, and the columns show the progression of the data through the registers over time.
