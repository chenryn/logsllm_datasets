DIRECTORY 
DESCRIPTION 
/ 
Root directory, present on 
virtually all UNIX based file 
systems. Parent directory of all 
other files 
.DS_Store  
This file Desktop Service Store 
contains Finder settings, such as 
icon location, position of icons, 
choice of a background image, 
window size and the names of all 
files (and also directories) in 
that folder. The file will appear 
in any directory that you’ve 
viewed with the Finder and and 
has functions similar to the file 
desktop.ini in MicrosoftWindows. 
.DocumentRevisions-V100/  
DocumentRevisions-V100 is an 
internal version control system 
introduced by Apple in OSX Lion. 
Large database that saves a copy 
of a file each, track changes, 
revert, each every time you save 
it. Apple uses it for TextEdit, 
KeyNote, Pages, Numbers, and some 
other programs. Developers can 
188 
also interact with this API in 
their apps. 
.fseventsd/  
File system events daemon process 
that writes file system event log 
files and is responsible for 
handling changes to the file 
system. Directory acts as a 
staging or buffer area for 
notifications for userspace 
process. 
.HFS+ Private Directory 
Data?/ 
.HFS+ Private Directory Data\r 
and HFS+ Private Data are special 
folders used by the HFS+ 
filesystem to handle hard-linked 
folders and files, respectively. 
HFS+ doesn’t support hard links 
and UNIX, upon which macOS is 
based, requires them. So 
developer macOS simulated hard 
links; any file that has more 
than one link is moved into one 
of these invisible directories as 
an inode; the actual hard links 
are just aliases to the inode 
file with a special flag set in 
its metadata. 
.PKInstallSandboxManager/  
Used for software updates and the 
Sandbox 
.PKInstallSandboxManager-
SystemSoftware/ 
Used for system software updates 
.Spotlight-V100/ 
Spotlight index data for searches 
.Trashes/ 
Trash folder, stored individually 
on each mounted volume, contains 
files that have been placed in 
Trash. On a boot volume, such 
files are stored in ~/.Trash . On 
a non-boot volume, these files 
are in /.Trashes/$UID/ 
.vol/ 
A pseudo-directory used to access 
files by their ID or inode 
number, maps HFS+ file IDs to 
files. If you know a file’s ID, 
you can open it using /.vol/ID 
/Applications/ 
Contains all Mac OS X 
applications 
/bin/ 
Essential common binaries and 
files/programs needed to boot the 
operating system. 
/cores/ 
Symbolic link to /private/cores .

189

core.pid  
/dev/

peripheral devices including 
keyboards, mice, trackpads 
/etc/->private/etc/

contains machine local system 
configuration, holds

specific to that user]. 
/net/ 
Common default automounter local

/net/hostname/nfspath where 
hostname is the host name of the 
remote machine and nfspath is the 
path that is exported over NFS on 
the remote machine.
