The above mentioned conservation equations are implemented
for the pipe setup, and a steady state is established. The valve is then
suddenly closed and the resulting transient pressure fluctuations
p(t) occurring inside the pipe are recorded. These results are then
used in the next step to evaluate the structural response of the pipe
element using ANSYS.
We choose Finite Element Analysis (FEA) for performing our
mechanical simulations because the governing equation of struc-
tural mechanics cannot be solved directly for complex problems.
The Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to compute the numerical
solution of such structural analysis problems. In FEM, the structural
problem is modeled with the help of discrete elements called ‘finite
elements’ interconnected at discrete points called nodes. This al-
lows the user to simulate extreme loading conditions which might
be costly to test experimentally or difficult to recreate in a labora-
tory setting. Moreover, FEA has the advantage of visualizing the
results which cannot be done theoretically or experimentally, for
e.g. internal stress distribution. Hence, by visualizing the results
we can better understand the safety of the structure and possible
failure locations in the system.
This analysis is carried out to evaluate the stress concentration
zones and to determine the distribution of deformation throughout
the length of the pipe segment. The maximum displacement is
a measure of the strength of the water hammer. The higher the
displacement, higher is the chance of mechanical failures along the
pipeline and its fixtures.
Fig. 5 shows the schematic of the geometry used for constructing
the 3D Finite element model along with the boundary conditions
used. The inner radius (Rin) and wall thickness of the pipe are
set at 0.0134 m and 0.0025 m respectively. It is assumed that the
pipe is supported at every 2.5 m. The FE model contains 540, 883
nodes, each having three translational and three rotational degrees
of freedom. Structural steel was selected as the material of the

pipeline and it’s mechanical properties are presented in Table 4. The
material is assumed to be isotropic and linear elastic. As mentioned
earlier, the pipe is loaded with the time varying pressure profile
p(t) obtained using the control volume analysis. This pressure is
uniformly distributed throughout the inner surface of the pipe.
6.2 Impact of Performance Attacks
6.2.1 Thermal Performance Ratio. Fig. 6 shows the relationship
between TPR and the financial loss imposed by cyber attacks. It
can be seen that as TPR decreases, financial loss increases. So,
for causing a financial impact, intuitively, the adversary needs to

flowing into the brine heater. This in turn reduces the amount of
distillate produced causing the aforementioned financial impact.
For decreasing TPR, the setpoint of ‘PI controller 1’ can be adjusted,
which in turn changes the input steam flow. It can be observed
in Fig. 6 that a relatively small decrease in the amount of steam
supplied to brine heater leads to large decrease in the amount of
distillate produced and a corresponding decrease in TPR.
In our attack simulation, we change the setpoint from 93◦C
to 90◦C (point ‘a’ in Fig. 6) which results in an average decrease
of 1.07 ton/min (point ‘b’ in Fig. 6) in distillate production and a
corresponding decrease in TPR (point ‘c’ in Fig. 6). If we assume
an undetected attack and the plant operation of 5 years, the total
estimated financial loss caused by this attack turns out to be more
than $3 million considering a plant capacity of 50,000 ton of distillate
per day.
Since the adversary needs to remain undetected for incurring
maximum economic damage, decreasing the setpoint by a large
amount is not advisable as this might lead to attack detection due to
the use of additional quality control sensors that are not connected
to the SCADA system. Another approach for decreasing the perfor-
mance of a desalination plant while remaining within operational
limits would be to change the P or I value of the appropriate PI
Controller. For instance, by changing the I value of ‘PI controller
1’ from 0.001 to 1, reduces the distillate flow rate by 0.04 ton/min.
This would effectively lead to an estimated financial loss of around
$130K if the attack is undetected for 5 years. The adversary can
also adjust the setpoint associated with ‘PI Controller 2’. It was
observed in our attack simulation that an increase in setpoint by
27% decreased the distillate flow rate by 0.08 ton/min while the
blowdown flow rate remains constant. This loss of distillate product
will incur an estimated financial loss of more than $250K assuming
that the attack remains unnoticed for 5 years.
The attacker can also leverage false data injection for decreas-
ing the performance of a desalination plant. For instance, in our
attack simulation, injecting ‘Sensor 9’ which measures initial brine
temperature with a value of 94◦C instead of 93◦C, decreases the
steam flow to 1,000 kg/min which is the minimum allowed. This
further reduces the distillate flow rate to just 4.57 ton/min. But such
a drastic decrease, while effective, might be detected by the plant
operators. So, the adversary in this case has to spoof the sensor
signal only for a fixed repeating interval so that the overall average
distillate flow rate is not decreased by a noticeable amount. In an
effort to remain within operational limits, we injected false data
to ‘Sensor 9’ of ‘PI controller 1’ at a repeating fixed time interval.
This created a repeating interval where we decreased the distillate
output and observed an average decrease of 0.7 ton/min in distil-
late output. Assuming a 5-years operation, this would lead to an
estimated financial loss of more than $220K.
Specific Feed Flow Rate. Fig. 7 displays the relationship be-
6.2.2
tween the SFF rate and financial loss. It can be seen that as the
SFF rate increases, there is also a corresponding increase in the
financial loss incurred. This is because an increase in the amount
of SFF signifies the use of more input feed brine flow for creating
the same amount of distillate.
Figure 7: Change in distillate flow during attack simulation
for SFF by manipulating recycle brine flow rate. Financial
loss w.r.t SFF over a period of 5 years is shown in magenta.
In order to increase the SFF rate, the adversary can use an actu-
ator attack to manipulate the actuators controlled by the SCADA
system. For our attack demonstration, we increase the flow of feed
sea water through ‘Actuator 3’ and decrease the flow of recycle
brine through ‘Actuator 4’. This effectively increases the amount
of feed brine required and decreases the recycle brine, which in
turn results in a reduction of the amount of distillate produced.
As shown in Fig. 7, in our attack simulation, the SFF parameter is
maximum at around 201 ton/min flow of recycle brine (point ‘a’ in
Fig. 7) and the distillate produced decreases by 1.06 ton/min (point
‘b’ in Fig. 7). So, if the plant runs for 5 years without suspicion, the
desalination plant in this case would incur an estimated financial
loss of more than $3 million.
Fig. 8 displays the relationship between the SCW rate and the
corresponding financial loss. It can be observed that as the SCW
rate increases, financial loss increases as well. This is because an
increase in SCW rate signifies an increase in the amount of required
input cooling seawater for the same amount of distillate produced.
An actuator attack can be used to increase SCW. Ideally this
value should be as low as possible, but the adversary can manipu-
late ‘Actuator 2’ for increasing the reject flow rate, which in turn
increases the amount of cooling seawater required by the desalina-
tion plant. This increase in SCW parameter due to attack initiation
can be observed in Fig. 8, where point ‘a’ represents the value of
SCW parameter during normal operation and point ‘b’ represents
the SCW value just after attack initiation.

6.3 Impact of Mechanical Failure Attacks
6.3.1 Water Hammer. Water hammer can be initiated by incorrect
operation of the actuators of the desalination plant. Fig. 10a shows
the change in pressure in the pipe as a result of water hammer. It
can be seen from the plot that there is a maximum increase in the
pressure of about 5 Mpa.
By using the aforementioned pressure values, a FEA is performed
in ANSYS. Fig. 10b shows the von Mises stress or equivalent stress
induced in the pipe during the water hammer. This stress value is
used to determine if the given material will fail due to yielding. It is
evident that there are considerable internal stresses on the pipe as
a result of pressure surge from the water hammer. The maximum
von Mises stress observed in the FEA are of the order of ≈ 340MPa,
which is considerably higher than 215MPa, the yield strength of
the pipe material. The corresponding displacement in the pipe is
plotted in Fig. 10c. It can be observed that the pipe experiences
significantly violent displacements during water hammer. This type
of excessive stress and displacement in the pipe can also lead to
breakdowns at restraints and fixtures.
For modeling the stresses experienced by the pipe, we assume
that the pipe is clamped at its two ends. The maximum displacement
experienced by the pipe is in its middle portion and reaches a value
of 19.938 mm. Moreover, fixtures supporting the pipe structure also
experience von Mises stress of the order of ≈ 309MPa. Overtime
repeated occurrence of water hammer will cause mechanical dam-
age due to fatigue that can be exploited to bring down the plant. In
our attack demonstration leveraging recycle brine flow to perform
water hammer, the adversary exploited access to actuators 1, 2, 4,
and 10. It should again be emphasized that component destruction
requires extensive pre-attack testing using the exact components
in a lab setting.
Figure 9: Change in salinity of seawater when Actuator 8 is
attacked.
For instance, during normal operation, the desalination plant
will remain in the salinity limit ranging from 63,765 ppm to 76,417
ppm which is shown by 2 operation cycles. The blowdown rate is
adjusted such that maximum salinity of the plant remains in a safe
range. We simulated an actuator attack repeating after fixed inter-
vals by closing the blowdown valve which temporarily increased
salinity from 76,417 ppm (point ‘a’ in Fig. 9) to as high as 99,863
ppm. Specifically, we temporarily blocked ‘Actuator 10’, which is
used to control blowdown flow rate, such that more amount of
recycle brine accumulated in final stage of flashing chamber, thus
increasing the salinity. After reaching this maximum, ‘Actuator 10’
is switched back to normal operation.
To make this attack relatively unnoticed, the attack needs to
be triggered only at specific intervals and fake data needs to be
supplied to the SCADA monitoring system. Upon completion of
the attack during each iteration, the blowdown valve was switched
back to normal operation. Depending on the cyber attack motives,
the adversary may choose to increase salinity with a much lower
rate or also to a higher salinity value.
