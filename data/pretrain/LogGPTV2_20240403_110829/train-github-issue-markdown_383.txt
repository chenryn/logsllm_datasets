Hi  
First I would like to point out that the documentation for WebXRManager has
missing functions that are there in the source but not mentioned in the
documentation. Not sure how you want to tackle this as in the source there is
no comments about what these extra functions do. The webxr section could
benefit of some more docu.
I was in the need of getting the fov of the AR camera when in immersive-ar
mode in WebXR and stumbled upon WebXRManager.getCamera(). Some tutorial say
that this is the AR/VR camera that is used.  
On my phone it reports a fov of 50 always (once you enter AR mode). Which is
not right. So what is this function supposed to do?
I ended up calculating the fov like so once a XRFrame was available.  
Do you propose a different solution? You could add a function to WebXRManager
that has the below code.  
I dont know what the getCamera function does in VR mode, maybe it works but in
AR mode i dont think it works as expected.
       let ref= this.renderer.xr.getReferenceSpace();
                let pose= frame.getViewerPose(ref);
                if (pose) {
                let fovi = pose.views[0].projectionMatrix[5];
                const fov = Math.atan2(1, fovi) * 2 * 180 / Math.PI;
                console.log(fov);
                }
Thanks
