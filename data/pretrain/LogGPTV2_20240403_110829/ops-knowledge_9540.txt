I have multiple versions of Python installed on my Ubuntu operating system. I have successfully configured Sublime Text 3 (ST3) to run Python 2 code. However, I would also like the option to run and debug Python code using the command console. 

I noticed that when I open the command console, it uses Python 3 by default, whereas I want it to use Python 2. Is there a way to set the default Python version for the command console?

**Solution:**

To set the default Python version for the command console in Sublime Text 3, follow these steps:

1. Go to `Tools` > `Build System` > `New Build System`.
2. In the new build system file, you can specify the path to the Python 2 binary.

Here is an example of how you can configure the build system to use Python 2:

```json
{
    "cmd": ["/usr/bin/python2", "-u", "$file"],
    "selector": "source.python",
    "file_regex": "^[ ]*File \"(...*?)\", line ([0-9]*)",
    "variants":
    [
        {
            "name": "Syntax Check",
            "cmd": ["/usr/bin/python2", "-m", "py_compile", "$file"]
        }
    ]
}
```

Save this file with a `.sublime-build` extension, and then select it from the `Tools` > `Build System` menu.

Thank you!
