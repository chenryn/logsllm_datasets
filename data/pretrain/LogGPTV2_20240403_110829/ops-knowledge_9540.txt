User: I have multiple python version installed in Ubuntu OS. I've set up sublime text 3 (ST3) to run python2 code successfully. But I would like to have the option to run python code using command console during debugging as well. But I found that when I open the cmd console, the python version that it used is not the same of the python that I'm building my python code. To be exact, cmd console called python3, while I would like it to use python2. Any way to set which default python that the cmd console call? Thanks.
Assistant: Tools > Build System > New Build System
You can set it up there and choose your python binary
