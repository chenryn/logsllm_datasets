# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18363.0
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): 0.6.2911.0
    Any other software?
    I use PowerToys FancyZones to size my window.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Launch Windows Terminal with PowerShell Core as the current tab's shell
  2. Resize the window to slightly small width to trigger line wraps
  3. Run something that prints long lines of output. In my case, I was running `scoop update`.
# Expected behavior
Lines are wrapped correctly.
# Actual behavior
Lines are not wrapping but rather writing over themselves.
