Purchasers are able to source and order products
through a custom browser window accessing their
approved suppliers, and through a supplier’s web site
directly. A range of approval, management and
reporting functions support the procurement process.
Suppliers use a cataloguing system to create and
maintain their product information, and define different
account classes with specific pricing. They collect
orders online and process them through to fulfillment.
3.2 TRADEZONE security policy
The MAFTIA conceptual model characterises a
security policy in terms of security goals and security
rules [2]. Security goals are intended to capture the
high-level security requirements and as such, any
violation of the goals constitutes a security failure. In
contrast, rules are typically lower-level constraints on
the system behaviour that are designed to ensure that
(possibly malicious)
the system is robust against
faults. Violations of the rules will
typically not
correspond to security failures but correspond to
erroneous states in which the system is more prone to
failure.
3.2.1. Security goals. The high-level security goals of
the TRADEZONE security policy are to provide a
secure and timely transaction service:
(cid:127) Purchasers should be correctly charged for
goods they receive.
(cid:127) Suppliers should receive correct payment for
goods supplied.
(cid:127) Suppliers should dispatch goods in a timely
fashion once an order has been accepted.
(cid:127) Purchasers should confirm receipt of goods in a
timely fashion.
(cid:127) Banks should process payment requests and
post confirmation signals in a timely fashion.
(cid:127) The integrity and availability of supplier
catalogues should be assured.

(cid:127) All transactions should remain confidential.
Internet
Authorisation Service
3.2.2. Security rules. In order to achieve these
security goals, the TRADEZONE application must be
designed to enforce security rules such as the
following:
(cid:127) A registered purchaser should have read access
to all the catalogues.
(cid:127) A registered supplier should only have write
access to their own catalogue.
(cid:127) All communications should be authenticated
and logged by TRADEZONE.
(cid:127) All messages should be authenticated and
encrypted.
(cid:127) All orders should follow the steps of
the
TRADEZONE transaction workflow.
3.2.3. Security failures. A security failure will occur
if one of the security goals of the TRADEZONE
application is violated. For example:
(cid:127) A supplier receives payment for which there is
no corresponding delivery of goods.
(cid:127) Goods are delivered but the supplier does not
receive payment.
Such failures could be due to flaws in the
formulation or implementation of the security rules,
allowing someone to fake order and receipt messages
for example. Alternatively,
the failure of an
authentication mechanism might allow fake messages
to be introduced into the system. Finally, failures
could be due to a fault
in the architectural
assumptions. For example,
the implementation of
trusted channels might be flawed, allowing fake
payment messages to be inserted into the system, or
the authorisation mechanisms might be bypassable.

Figure 2. TRADEZONE in a MAFTIA
setting
This setting represents both a logical and physical
system configuration. The logical configuration
identifies the interactions between components. The
physical configuration shows the relationship between
single site purchasers and suppliers (here only two are
shown), the multi-site Authorisation Service (AS), the
multi-site Intrusion Detection System (IDS), and the
TRADEZONE service with its transaction and resource
managers. The IDS is composed of IDS sensors, event
analysers, and System Security Officers (SSOs) who
administer the system and receive notifications from
the IDS. The secure channels between the systems
form a Virtual Private Network (VPN), implemented
using a well-known standard such as IPSec. However,
MAFTIA mechanisms are used to enhance the security
capabilities of the services provided over the Internet.
All multi-site services use replication and fault
masking to achieve
intrusion tolerance. The
authorisation service uses probabilistic asynchronous
Byzantine-agreement protocols and diversity  is used to
reduce the chance of a common mode failure. The
TRADEZONE services are replicated, using the TTCB
to construct a trusted channel between the servers that
is tamper-proof by design.
In order to be enabled for secure operation, each
distributed site (host) must be associated with a
MAFTIA-issued smartcard containing the security keys
needed for secure communication and authorisation.

representative, although by no means exhaustive, set of
informal attack scenarios that were intended to

strengths of the MAFTIA conceptual model is that

Note that we distinguish MAFTIA fault-events
from IPSec fault-events and others. To this end, we
use different shadings, and in this regard, MAFTIA
fault-events correspond to failures of MAFTIA’s
intrusion-tolerance capabilities.
As part of our analysis of each event, we identified

functioning of MAFTIA-compliant system services.
3.5. Example

requires her
To illustrate our basic approach, we now consider
the ways in which Malice might subvert the MAFTIA
authorisation service. This
to form
acceptable operational requests that appear to come
from target  sites (in this case the purchaser’s sites) by
inserting or modifying high-level operation requests
(with valid vouchers), and thereby having them
honoured by the TRADEZONE reference monitor. As
our methodology is qualitative and based upon
standard approaches to developing fault trees, these
ways to subvert the authorisation service have been
arrived at by applying human expertise and judgment.
The cases considered are as follows.
(cid:127) Authorisation service compromised
o Malice modifies the authorisation service’s
access-control matrix.
o Malice forges illegal capabilities.
(cid:127) Authorised user impersonated
o Malice steals the purchaser’s smartcard and
obtains its PIN.
o Malice forges a user’s smartcard.
These cases are illustrated below and discussed
thereafter. Note that we do  not consider the possibility
that the authorisation mechanisms on the local host
could be bypassed.2 This is reasonable because the

host, an insider might be able to bypass the local reference monitor
within TRADEZONE, and thus be able to run any unauthorised
operation locally (e.g., fake purchase). However,
this would be
much more difficult if the TRADEZONE server was composed of
dedicated hosts (e.g., catalogue, purchase request,
invoice,
delivery). In that case, even if one host is subverted, it would still

particular host is corrupted, it cannot persuade a non-

its behalf [12].
