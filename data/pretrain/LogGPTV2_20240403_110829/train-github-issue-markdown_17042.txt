BUG.
**What is the current behavior?**
Here is JSFiddle, just try to edit the default value `2.34` to something else,
like `3.45`. As soon as i insert dot, cursor stars to jump in input.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
It is not working in Chrome `v53` on React `v15.3.2` and also `v15.3.1`. I did
not try to go very far back, but i tried it on old JSBin with React `v0.13.2`
and that worked.
On Firefox it is correctly **working**.
