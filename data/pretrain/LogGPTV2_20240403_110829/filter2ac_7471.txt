### Title: Unpacking the Packed Unpacker: Reverse Engineering an Android Anti-Analysis Native Library

Malware authors employ a variety of techniques to hinder analysis and make reverse engineering more challenging. These anti-analysis and anti-reverse engineering methods often aim to mislead investigators or force them to spend excessive time on trivial code. In this talk, we will delve into one of the most sophisticated anti-analysis native libraries observed in the Android ecosystem.

I will examine the specific techniques employed by the malware author to prevent the reverse engineering of their Android native library. These include:

- Manipulation of the Java Native Interface (JNI)
- Encryption
- Runtime environment checks
- Additional obfuscation methods

This presentation will not only detail the anti-analysis techniques but also provide a step-by-step guide for reverse engineers to navigate through these traps. By the end of the talk, attendees will be equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to uncover what Android malware authors are trying to conceal.
