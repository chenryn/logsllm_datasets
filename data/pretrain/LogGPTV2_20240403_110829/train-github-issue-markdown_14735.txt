Documents of different types tend to have different fields, which can lead to
problems of sparsity when documents are stored in the order that they were
indexed. If we sort documents by type, then missing values (eg in doc values
or norms) can be represented very efficiently.
On merge, documents should be sorted by type (assuming there is more than one
type). Additionally, for certain use cases, it can make sense to apply a
secondary sort (eg on timestamp). This secondary level should be customizable
per index, and should probably be dynamically updatable (although it would
only have effect on later merges).
