### CANSPY: A Platform for Auditing CAN Devices

#### The 6LoWPAN Protocol
- **IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN)**
  - Header compression flags
  - Address factoring (Interface Identifier (IID) or predefined)
  - Predefined values (e.g., Time to Live (TTL))
  - Fields omission (when unused)
  - Use of contexts (index-based)
  - UDP header compression (ports and checksum)
  - Packet fragmentation
  - Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): 127 bytes vs. 1500 bytes
  - Effective payload: 80 bytes

#### Key Features and Challenges
- **What’s the Big Deal?**
  - [Insert key points or challenges related to 6LoWPAN auditing]

#### IEEE 802.15.4 Standard
- **Physical (PHY) Layer and Media Access Control (MAC) Sublayer**
  - Multiple possible configurations
  - Network topology
  - Data transfer model
  - Multiple security suites (integrity, confidentiality, or both)
  - Encryption key sizes (32, 64, or 128 bits)
  - Multiple standard revisions (2003, 2006, and 2011)

#### Deviations from the Standard
- [Insert details on deviations and their implications]

#### The ARSEN Project
- **Advanced Routing between 6LoWPAN and Ethernet Networks**
  - Detect the configuration of existing 802.15.4 infrastructure
    - Network topology
    - Data transfer model
    - Security suite
    - Standard revision
    - Standard deviations
  - Handle packet translation
    - Compression/decompression
    - Fragmentation/defragmentation
  - Support all possible IEEE 802.15.4 configurations

#### Based on Scapy-radio
- [Insert details on how Scapy-radio is used in the project]

#### Two Main Components
- **IEEE 802.15.4 Scanner**
  - Build a database of devices and captured frames
  - Identify devices running on a given channel
  - Track communication between devices
  - Analyze types of frames exchanged
  - Record parameters used for frame transmission

- **6LoWPAN Border Router**
  - TUN interface
  - Ethernet omitted
  - Scapy automaton

#### New Scapy Layers
- **Dot15d4.py**
  - Several bug fixes
  - Complete support for 2003 and 2006 standards

- **Sixlowpan.py**
  - Uncompressed IPv6 support
  - Complete IP header compression support
  - UDP header compression support
  - Fragmentation and defragmentation support

#### Demonstration
- [Insert details or steps for the demonstration]
