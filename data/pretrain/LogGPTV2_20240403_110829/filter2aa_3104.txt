AGENDA
• Where We Were & Where We Are Now
• Blue Sharpens Red
• Old-School AD Admin Methods
• The New School Methods
• Exploiting Administrative Assumptions
• The Latest “Best Way” to Admin AD (& How to Bypass It)
• Conclusion
Where We Were
• In the beginning, there were admins everywhere. 
• Some environments actually had almost as many Domain Admins as 
users.
• This resulted in a target rich environment with multiple paths to 
exploit.
• Traditional methods of administration are trivial to attack and 
compromise due to admin credentials being available on the 
workstation.
Where We Are Now
• Organizations are slowly & gradually improving defenses. 
• Limit privileged rights 
• Reduce admin group membership 
• Reduce rights down to what's actually required
• Limit Admin logon capability & location
• Group Policy or user logon controls 
• This is definitely a step in the right direction, but still does not *solve* 
the issues with how administration is typically done 
• Mostly still performed from a regular workstation
Blue Sharpens Red (& vice versa)
• if you were used to running your standard playbook and never made 
it past Chapter 1, know that this will change (if it hasn't already).
• There will always be weaknesses to exploit, but defenders are getting 
better. Red needs to adapt.
• What do you do when the standard playbook doesn’t work?
Old-School AD Administration
• Logon to workstation as an admin 
• RunAs on workstation and run standard Microsoft 
MMC admin tools ("Active Directory Users & 
Computers“) 
• RDP to Domain Controllers to manage them
Old-School AD Administration
• Logon to workstation as an admin 
• Credentials in LSASS
• RunAs on workstation and run standard Microsoft 
MMC admin tools ("Active Directory Users & 
Computers“) 
• Credentials in LSASS.
• RDP to Domain Controllers to manage them
• Credentials in LSASS on remote server & keylog locally for 
creds.
The New School of Administration
• No RunAs on workstations with admin rights.
• RDP to Admin/Jump Server which may require two-factor/multi-
factor auth.
• AD Admin credential authentication may be limited to specific admin 
servers and DCs.
Demo: Bloodhound 
Exploiting Administrative Assumptions
• Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs) are often deployed and 
misconfigured.
• Sometimes attributes contain passwords (or other sensitive info).
DEMO:
How to determine what systems the Admins are authorized to logon to (using LDAP 
calls to AD) and probe those systems for enabled protocols (WMI, 
WSMan/PowerShell Remoting, etc).
Attacking the Password Vault
Attacking Password Vaults
• Companies are frequently turning to password vault technology to help 
improve administrative security.
• Tend to be either CyberArk or Thycotic SecretServer.
• PV often has a “reconciliation” account which is a DA to bring accounts 
back into compliance.
Password Vault Management
• Password vault maintains DA account(s)
• Admin connects to website & authenticates to the PV.
• Admin gets a password to use with the DA account
• Admin is proxied via the webserver through a RDP session to an Admin 
server or DC
Password Vault Weaknesses
• Authentication to the PV webserver is typically performed with the 
admin’s user account.
• Connection to the PV webserver doesn’t always require 2FA/MFA.
• The PV servers are often administered like any other server.
• Anyone on the network can send traffic to the PV server(s).
Admin Servers
Jump (Admin) Servers
• If Admins are not using Admin workstations, keylog
for creds on admin’s workstation.
• Discover all potential remoting services.
• RDP (2FA?)
• WMI
• WinRM/PowerShell Remoting
• PSExec
• NamedPipe
• Compromise a Jump Server, 0wn the domain!

Hijacking the Admin/Jump Server
• Get Admin on the server
• Get SYSTEM
• Run tscon.exe as SYSTEM
”if you run tscon.exe as the SYSTEM user, you can connect to 
any session without a password”

Alexander Korznikov demonstrates using Sticky Keys and tscon to access an administrator RDP 
session — without even logging into the server.

Red Forest
Red/Admin Forest Discovery
• Check trusts for 1-way trust where the production AD trusts another 
AD forest and Selective Authentication is enabled.
• Enumerate group membership of the domain Administrators group 
for a group or groups that are in this other forest.
The Latest “Best” Way to Admin AD & How to 
Get Around It
• Several organizations have deployed an Admin Forest and often 
ignore the primary production AD since all administrators of the AD 
forest are in the Red Forest.
• They often don't fix all the issues in the prod AD.
• They often forget about service accounts.
• Target agents on Domain Controllers.
• Identify systems that connect to DCs with privileged credentials on 
DCs (backup accounts).
Recommendations
Conclusion
• Most organizations have done "something" to better secure their 
environment
• It's often not enough, though some are successfully detecting 
pentest/red team engagements.

environments and what is needed.
• Recommendations you can pass on to customers to help them 
improve their admin hygiene and security.
