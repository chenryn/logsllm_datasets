Some uses of leaked password databases are clearly not
ethical. leakedsource.com was shut down and its operators
arrested as a result of its use of leaked passwords [83]. It
made password hashes (or even cracked passwords) available
to anyone who was willing to pay for the access. This is in
marked contrast to the ethical service haveibeenpwned.com
which never makes passwords available and doesn’t expose
any personal information without veriﬁcation of control of
the email address for that leaked information [66]. havei-
beenpwned.com maximises beneﬁt by enabling users to ﬁnd
out if their data has been leaked and notifying them if their
data is leaked in the future while minimising harm as it does
not share private data with anyone or use it for any other
purpose.
6.5 Leaked databases
While password dumps are a speciﬁc restricted form of data,
in this section we consider more general leaking of entire
databases that contain more detailed information such as
messages or logs of activity. These databases are available in
underground forums or from public repositories, sometimes
for free. In this section, we cover three cases: Databases
of distributed denial of service (DDoS) providers (booters),
the Patreon database (a web site aimed at crowd-founding
projects), and the databases of several underground forums.
6.5.3 Booter databases leak. Booters (sometimes called
stressers) provide DDoS-as-a-Service. While their operators
might sometimes claim that this is legal [68], this activity
is almost always illegal4 (Computer misuse), and it is also
unethical. Several approaches have been used to understand
this criminal ecosystem: interviewing operators after contact-
ing them through their websites [68], measuring the attacks
they produce [332], and using their leaked databases and
source code. Karami et al. analysed a database dump of the
TwBooter service. Their Safeguards to make this research
ethical were to not publish personally identiﬁable data, ex-
cept when this was already publicly known [76]. Later they
analysed database dumps from Asylum and LizardStresser
and scraped data from VDOS [77]. For the latter they ob-
tained an REB exemption on the basis these data did not
contain any personally identiﬁable information and used pub-
licly leaked data. In some jurisdictions (e.g. Germany [337])
IP addresses may be personally identiﬁable data and the
dumps likely contained email addresses which can be simi-
larly identiﬁable. Santanna et al. analysed database dumps
from 37 distinct booters and used Karami’s procedures to
justify it ethically [;5]. Thomas et al. used database dumps
and scraped data from booters to evaluate the coverage of
their honeypot based measurement of DDoS attacks, they
argued that using this data was necessary as there was no
other ground truth on attacks initiated by booters [332].
All these papers had some Identiﬁcation of stakeholders,
Identify harms and used Safeguards. These dumps can con-
tain details of user accounts including names, email addresses,
password hashes and security questions; details of the backend
and frontend servers used for attacks (including compromised
hosts); logs of connections to the site including IP addresses
and user agent strings; logs of attacks including target IP
addresses, ports, domain names and the method used; tickets
and messages sent between users and site owners; records of
payments; details of pricing plans; and chat logs of site oper-
ators. Concretely, Thomas et al. used the attack logs [332];
Santanna et al. [;5] and Karami et al. [77] used attack logs,
payment records, pricing plans and counts of users. The
password hashes could be used for password research and the
ticket databases for qualitative research into the attitudes of
booter users and operators [68].
6.5.4 Patreon crowd-funding. In October 4237 the Patreon
crowd-funding website was hacked and the entire site made
available. This included data on projects, private messages,
source code, email addresses, and passwords. Poor and
Davidson, who were conducting research based on incomplete
data obtained by scraping the Patreon website would have
4The aim is usually illegal: attempting to stop someone’s Internet
connection from working; and the mechanism is often also illegal: using
UDP ampliﬁcation attacks that make unauthorised use of misconﬁg-
ured UDP servers or using botnets of compromised machines.

Daniel R. Thomas et al.
liked to use this data but concluded it would be unethical
to do so [:7]. These data were publicly available and the
researchers hoped to serve the public through their research.
However, it would be hard for them to distinguish between
public and private data within the dump, and they might see
private data unintentionally. Furthermore using the dump
might legitimize criminal activity, violate user’s expectations
of privacy, and the use of this data would be without their
consent.
Importantly they also did not need to use this
data to do their research, as scraping the Patreon website
would also provide the data they needed, without the risk
of accidentally including private data. This is an example
where the authors Identify harms and chose not to use data
of illicit origin as a result since they could not ensure that
there would be no additional harm.
6.5.5 Underground forums. Underground forums focus on
trading, learning and discussing illegal or criminal topics, such
as hacking material, credit cards and drugs. These forums
often also cover other non-illegal topics, such as video-games,
ﬁnancial help, politics, and sport.
Several forum databases have been leaked in the past. The
w2rm.ws forum database was hacked by an anonymous group
of hackers under the pseudonym “Peace of Mind”, allegedly in
response to some prior attack on the forum “Hell” [338]. All
the forum content, personal data, as well as exploits and hack-
ing material was made public. The database of carders.cc, a
German forum focused on ﬁnancial information trading (such
as credit cards or bank accounts) was hacked and leaked [7;].
In 4238, the database of the forum nulled.io was leaked,
containing “758 286 user accounts with :22 7;5 user per-
sonal messages, 7 7:4 purchase records and 34 822 invoices
which seem to include donation records” [;2]. Motoyama et
al. presented one of the ﬁrst works analysing underground
forums using leaked databases, however, they did not discuss
ethics [98]. Yip et al. perform social network analysis using
a database of three carding forums (Cardersmarket, Dark-
market and Shadowcrew) which included private messages
of the participants [345]. This research showed that forums
are a preferred way for criminals to communicate. They
do not provide any discussion about the ethics of their re-
search, however they indicate that the marketplace actors are
anonymous, so it is not possible to obtain Informed consent.
Analysing data from underground forums can provide valu-
able insights into how markets for stolen data work [69], how
malware conﬁgurations are shared [67], new forms of criminal
networks that arise in cyberspace [98], common goods and
assets being traded [:8], economy of spam campaigns [325]
or even to provide Indicators of Compromise (IoC) and other
useful information for threat intelligence [8;, ;4]. This makes
it of Public interest. Indeed, the conclusions drawn from these
works are undoubtedly valuable to law enforcement agencies
and crime prevention strategies that arise as a result can
provide social beneﬁts (e.g. preventing terrorist attacks, cy-
berattacks, or child sexual exploitation). However, there
are other ethical considerations: the research should con-
sider potential harms to the users of the forums, including
prosecution or physical threat, and compare them with the
beneﬁts. None of the works mentioned use Safeguards to
protect the data, which was originally illegally obtained [338].
Some authors have publicly re-released leaked datasets, even
including private information [36, :8]. While the goal is to
provide other researchers with datasets to conduct their ex-
periments and for reproducibility, public release means that
these datasets are potentially being shared with malicious
actors.
6.6 Financial data leaks
Leaks of commercially sensitive data such as data on contracts
and client relationships can reveal the hidden behaviour of
companies and individuals in ways that would be diﬃcult
to achieve through external measurement. In this section
we describe the leak of data from a law ﬁrm that revealed
the ﬁnancial behaviour of companies and individuals. Leaks
of peering arrangements between ISPs together with traﬃc
statistics likely present similar ethical issues, particularly if
the data demonstrate illegal behaviour such as contravening
network neutrality rules or the imposition of censorship.
Panama / Mossack Fonseca papers leak. In 4237 the internal
database of the Panamanian law ﬁrm Mossack Fonseca was
leaked to the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which
shared it with the International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists (ICIJ) [32;].
In 4238 the consortium and its
partners released numerous reports based on analysis of the
leaked data [64]. World leaders, celebrities, and companies
were found to be using Mossack Fonseca’s services for tax
evasion and other criminal purposes. Some of these data were
made publicly available and Europol identiﬁed 5 722 crimi-
nals among the clients of the ﬁrm using this data [:6]. There
was a substantial Public interest to this release as it identiﬁed
criminal and unethical activity by numerous individuals and
companies. This revelation may result in money laundering
and tax evasion becoming more diﬃcult in future due to
greater transparency, international cooperation, and fear of
disclosure. However, not all the clients of Mossack Fonseca
were engaged in illegal or unethical behaviour. Trautman
surveys the consequences of the leak describing many of the
media reports and investigations that resulted from it [333].
Murphy states that money laundering and tax evasion are
illegal, while tax avoidance is unethical [99]. He says tax is
the rightful property of the government, tax evasion is the
theft of the government’s rightful property, and tax avoidance
is a “con trick”. Promoting tax competition between countries
is seeking to undermine national sovereignty and subvert the
democratic (or other political) process and hence unethical.
The Guardian reports that ;7% of Mossack Fonseca’s work
involves selling ﬁnancial products to avoid taxes [64] and
hence almost all of the work they do would be described by
Murphy as unethical.
The Panama papers have been of interest to researchers,
as well as journalists, and law enforcement. Sharife uses the
Panama papers in a historical analysis to understand the
downfall of Banco Espírito Santo [;9]. Walkowski uses the
Ethical issues in research using datasets of illicit origin
IMC ’39, November 3–5, 4239, London, UK
Panama papers to argue for reform in legislation to increase
transparency and avoid tax competition [339]. O’Donovan
et al. evaluated the impact of the Panama papers on ﬁrm
values and found it reduced market capitalisation of 5;9
ﬁrms implicated in the leak by US$357 billion or 2.9% [9;].
Omartian used the Panama papers to investigate investor
response to changes in tax legislation in terms of oﬀshore
entity usage [:4]. He uses the introduction of legislation:
European Union Savings Directive (EUSD), Tax Information
Exchange Agreements (TIEAs), the Foreign Account Tax
Compliance Act (FATCA), and the Common Reporting Stan-
dard for information exchange (CRS) as natural experiments,
evaluating the impact on oﬀshore activity as revealed by the
Panama papers. He ﬁnds that they do have a signiﬁcant
impact.
None of these papers explicitly discuss the ethics of using
this data; they implicitly argue that they are in the public
interest. O’Donovan et al. [9;], and Oei and Ring [:2] Identify
harms resulting from the data being released while Omartian
provides evidence for tax laws that provide more Justice [:4].
McGregor et al. use the successful collaborative investiga-
tion into the Panama Papers that the ICIJ conducted as a
case study of secure collaboration [96]. They used a survey
of the journalists who used ICIJ’s systems and IRB approved
interviews of ICIJ’s staﬀ but did not analyse the content of
the Panama Papers. They detail many of the safeguards
used to protect the data and the investigation.
6.7 Classiﬁed materials
In this section we cover two well-known leaks of classiﬁed
information: Manning’s Wikileaks dump and Snowden’s NSA
data leak. In both cases, classiﬁed documents from the USA
government detailing war decisions, espionage or diplomatic
activities were publicly leaked.
6.7.3 Manning’s WikiLeaks dump. In 4232 Chelsea (then
Bradley) Manning leaked 922 222 documents and diplomatic
cables from the USA’s government systems to WikiLeaks [95].
This information was available to more than three million
USA government employees [87] and so it is likely that other
parties such as Russia and China that have large intelligence
agencies would already have had access to at least some of this
information. Originally WikiLeaks shared the unredacted
documents with carefully selected journalists. However, later
journalists published what they believed to be a temporary
encryption password only to discover that a copy of the
archive encrypted under that password had been shared on
BitTorrent [9]. Hence, the full and unredacted cables were
publicly released.
The use of WikiLeaks diplomatic cables and documents
in the academy is controversial. For example, professors
do not agree on the morality of using this information for
teaching foreign policy studies, despite the cables being a
valuable teaching tool [47]. Barnard “borrowed” classiﬁed
documents from the “controversial WikiLeaks” to analyse
covert relationships between USA and South Africa during
the Cold War [;]. The author claims that there were no
ethical dilemmas since all the classiﬁed data used was open
source and declassiﬁed. However, there is no evidence that
any of Manning’s WikiLeaks dump has been declassiﬁed.
Talarico and Zamparini analysed the smuggling of tobacco in
Italy between 4226 and 4236 [327]. They used a conﬁdential
document from the American Embassy in Italy, obtained
through WikiLeaks that said that the USA government had
blacklisted an Italian harbour because of collusion by harbour
staﬀ. Berger references several Manning cables to study the
international restrictions on the trade of weapons with North
Korea [34]. For example, Berger mentioned that the United
Arab Emirates bought missiles from North Korea, and a
diplomatic cable where USA thanked Iran for its cooperation
in blocking one cargo from North Korea.
Researchers have used this data to better understand the
diplomatic position of the USA government in several inter-
national conﬂicts. As Barnard points out, these documents
are controversial [;]. However, none of the studied works
discussed the ethics of their research. Some consider Manning
as a traitor while others consider her as a freedom ﬁghter. In
the research community, there is no consensus as to whether
publishing results based on these documents is ethical, and
in general, authors prefer not to confront the question.
6.7.4 Snowden’s NSA data leak. In 4235 Edward Snow-
den, a contractor for the USA’s National Security Agency
(NSA), leaked large amounts of NSA and GCHQ data to
journalists [:]. He was the latest in a long line of NSA leakers
who have revealed various aspects of NSA programmes [344].
Landau provides an overview of the data that was revealed by
Snowden, covering early leaks [86] and later leaks [85]. She
criticises the ethics of some of the leaks since “the speciﬁcs
on China had little to do with privacy and security of indi-
viduals”, but is mostly critical of the NSA/GCHQ and the
USA and UK governments, and she is mostly positive about
Snowden’s actions.
Several uses of the Snowden leaks make no mention of the
ethical considerations of doing so, but are implicitly critical
of the ethics of the activities exposed. In a newspaper article,
Schneier uses documents leaked by Snowden to explain how
the NSA unconditionally exploits Tor users’ browsers to
install implants that exﬁltrate data [;7]. In a magazine article
he argues that the metadata collection that was exposed
represents ubiquitous surveillance of everyone [;8]. RFC 9846
uses the Snowden leaks to inform a threat model for pervasive
surveillance, in order to inform protocol design, such that
the activities detailed in the Snowden leaks would be more
diﬃcult in future [32]. Lustgarten argued in 4237 that the
American Psychological Association had not taken account of
the Snowden leaks in its ‘Ethics Code’ and ‘Record Keeping
Guidelines’ as the leaks showed that the NSA would have
access to client data stored on cloud servers. Clinicians were
responsible for protecting this client data, and had legal
protections against enforced disclosure. This then raises
ethical concerns for psychologists, as their clients would not
have given informed consent for access to their data by the
NSA [89].
IMC ’39, November 3–5, 4239, London, UK
Daniel R. Thomas et al.
Others used the fact that the leaks had happened and their
impact rather than the actual content of the leaks for their
research. Preibusch used Snowden’s revelations to conduct an
experiment on the privacy behaviour of people after a major
privacy incident; he found little change in user behaviour [:9].
There has been substantial discussion of whether Snow-
den’s actions were legal and ethical and whether the NSA’s
activities were legal or ethical. Scheuerman argues that
Snowden’s actions were ethical civil disobedience and serve
as an example of correct behaviour [;6]. Kadidal describes
the impact on civil liberties of mass surveillance based on
what Snowden (and others) revealed [75]. Walsh and Miller
provide an ethical and policy analysis of intelligence agency
activity on the basis of Snowden’s revealing what current
practice was [33:]. Lucas discusses the application of the
principle of informed consent to mass surveillance as revealed
by Snowden, suggesting that revealing the outline of what
kind of activity is being conducted to the public is necessary
for the public to consent to it [88]. Barnett argues that
the NSA’s activities revealed in the Snowden leaks were un-
constitutional under the fourth amendment [33]. Inkster, a
former British Secret Intelligence Service Director, provides a
counter-narrative, claiming that the exposed activities were
not illegal, but rather entirely proper, in particular he states
that collecting data on everyone is not mass surveillance if
this data is only processed by computer programs and not
read by humans [73]. He implicitly argues that the newspa-
pers that published the leaked data acted unethically in doing
so and Snowden’s actions are clearly depicted as unethical
and illegal.
Since the leaked data was classiﬁed, and much of it remains
classiﬁed despite being publicly available, the use of it for
research or in court cases may have unexpected diﬃculties.
For example, in 4237 Barton Gellman gave a talk at Purdue
University that included some classiﬁed NSA slides. Pur-
due University had a facility security clearance to perform
classiﬁed USA government research and this incident was
treated as a classiﬁed information spillage. As a result, the
video recording of the talk was destroyed [58]. There is thus
an additional risk for researchers at institutions with facility
security clearances as if they work with leaked classiﬁed data
then they may ﬁnd that all their resulting work is destroyed
by facility authorities.
In 4239 the UK government was
considering making it an oﬀence to obtain sensitive infor-
