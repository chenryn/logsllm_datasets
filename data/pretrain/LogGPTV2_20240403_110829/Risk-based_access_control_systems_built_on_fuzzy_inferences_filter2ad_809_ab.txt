### ACM Digital Library and SpringerLink

A keyword-based search was conducted to gather articles relevant to the research topic and questions. The primary keywords used in the search included:

- Risk-Based Access Control
- Risk Estimation
- Risk Estimation Techniques
- Risk Factors
- Security Risk

### 4.4. Selection of Relevant Articles

The selection of relevant and recent studies on risk-based access control models began with 1,044 articles collected from various online digital libraries, as determined in the previous section. The selection process was divided into three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Initial Filtering**
   - The initial set of 1,044 articles was filtered based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria discussed in Section 4.2. The search was not limited to a specific time range to ensure the collection of all relevant publications on risk-based access control models.

2. **Phase 2: Relevance Assessment**
   - The remaining publications were assessed for relevance to the research topic and questions by examining only the title and abstract.

3. **Phase 3: Duplicate Removal**
   - This phase aimed to eliminate duplicate entries from the six different online digital libraries.

### 5. Analysis of Results

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the collected publications through the three phases, as illustrated in Figure 4. After assessing the titles and abstracts for relevance, 986 publications were excluded. Additionally, 32 duplicate publications were removed.

**Figure 4. Flow diagram of the search.**

The search across six well-known online databases allowed us to collect a comprehensive set of publications related to risk-based access control models. Table 2 summarizes the number of publications from each database after applying the three selection phases. Google Scholar emerged as the most significant source of relevant publications.

**Table 2. Number of search results per database after applying the three selection phases.**

|-------------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| IEEE Xplore             | 16      | 9       | 4       |
| PubMed                  | 52      | 10      | 5       |
| Google Scholar          | 886     | 37      | 28      |
| SpringerLink            | 48      | 7       | 2       |
| Elsevier ScienceDirect  | 22      | 8       | 3       |
| ACM Digital Library     | 20      | 5       | 2       |
| **Total**               | 1,044   | 76      | 44      |

**Figure 5. Number of selected articles published per year.**

The results indicate that the interest in risk-based access control models among researchers began to grow after 2010. However, it remains an underexplored area. The number of publications increased steadily from 2011 to 2013 but then decreased, with only one publication in 2019.

**Figure 6. Number of journal and conference publications per year.**

Most of the publications that matched our research questions were conference papers. Table 3 provides basic information about the analyzed and selected publications, including their ID, citation, type, and year of publication. All selected articles were published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings, with only three book chapters, which are also peer-reviewed.

### 6. Discussion

Risk-based access control is a rapidly evolving field, with many scholars investigating its potential to provide flexible, dynamic, and operational access control in distributed and dynamic systems. This paper serves as a valuable starting point for researchers to understand the model and review existing work. The following sections discuss how the retrieved publications address the proposed research questions.

**RQ1: What are the recent and peer-reviewed literature regarding risk-based access control models?**

To answer this research question, we will discuss the recent and peer-reviewed publications related to risk-based access control models. Table 4 summarizes the key contributions of each publication.
