4.4. Selection of Relevant Articles
Selecting relevant and recent studies with respect to the risk-based access control model started
with 1044 articles collected from various online digital libraries that were decided in the previous
section. The selection process on the collected publications was divided into three phases:
•
Phase 1: The results of the search and collected publications were ﬁltered depending on the
inclusion and exclusion criteria that were discussed in Section 4.2. The search conducted was
not bounded by a speciﬁc range of years to be able to collect all relevant publications regarding
risk-based access control models.

•
•
Phase 2: The publications collected from various online digital libraries were assessed depending
on the relevance of the publication to the topic and research questions by examining only the title
and abstract.
Phase 3: The main purpose of this phase was to remove the duplicates of the collected publications
from six diﬀerent online digital libraries.
5. Analysis of Results
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied on the collected publications through three
phases, as depicted in Figure 4. Based on the assessment through reading only the title and the
abstract and its relevance to the research questions, 986 publications were excluded. In addition, the
duplicates between diﬀerent online digital databases were excluded, in which 32 duplicate publications
were excluded.
Figure 4. Flow diagram of the search.
The search that was executed in six diﬀerent well-known online databases enables us to collect,
as much as possible, most of the publications that are relevant to risk-based access control models.
The result of the collected publications from each online database and the resultant number of
publications after applying the three selection phases can be shown in Table 2. The results show that
Google Scholar was the richest data source of publications related to risk-based access control models.

In addition, Figure 5 illustrates the number of articles published per year. The results show that
the risk-based access control model started to attract the attention of the researcher after 2010. However,
it is still an undiscovered area for multiple researchers. Given the steady number of publications in
2011, 2012, and 2013, we can see that the number of publications started to decrease, which reaches
only one in 2019.

The risk-based access control model is one of the hot topics that many scholars are investigating
to provide ﬂexible, dynamic, and operative access control approach in distributed and dynamic
systems. This paper can be a good starting point for such researchers to understand this model and
review existing work related to proposed research questions. In this section, a discussion of the
retrieved/analyzed publications was presented to show how the retrieved publications answered the
proposed research questions.
RQ1: What are recent and peer-reviewed literature regarding risk-based access control models?
To answer this research question, retrieved/analyzed publications that are related to risk-based
access control models will be discussed. Recent and peer-review publication outlined risk-based access
control models are discussed. Table 4 summarizes the contributions of each publication.

This paper presented a risk-based model that is based on the Multi-Level Security
(MLS) approach. The paper utilized the risk value resulted from the diﬀerence
between object and subject security level as a risk factor. Then, the fuzzy logic system
was applied to represent the risk as a binary value, where 0 allows the access and 1
denies the access.
This paper presented the main elements needed to build a dynamic and ﬂexible
risk-based access control model by collecting environmental information, assess it,
and make the access decision using a risk assessment.
This paper used the same elements of the risk-based model proposed by
Diep et al. [20] but with the use of the fuzzy logic system to estimates the risk value
associated with the access request. They indicated that the fuzzy logic system is an
eﬃcient method for evaluating the security risks of access control operations.
The major diﬀerence between both publications was the risk estimation technique
adopted to assess the security risk of each access request.
This paper provided a risk-based model by utilizing the risk assessment. The authors
collected environmental and contextual information and assessed it based on
outcomes of actions in term of CIA (Conﬁdentiality, Integrity, and Availability).
In addition, the MultiFactor Evaluation Process (MFEP) technique was utilized with
the risk assessment to estimate the security risk value related to each access request to
decide the access decision.
This paper proposed a risk-based model that employs the concept of “access ﬁrst and
verify later”; hence, the required information/data can be accessed immediately
without delaying access. The paper also utilized semantics to build situation role
hierarchies, which are used to assess the security risk to provide access decisions.
This paper proposed a Risk-Adaptable Access Control (RAdAC) model, which is
based on estimating the security risk and operational needs to grant or deny access.
This model was implemented to ﬁrst estimate the risk associated with the access
request then compares the estimated risk with the access control policy. After that,
the system veriﬁes the operational needs, if the associated operational needs and the
policy are met; then, the access is granted.
This paper utilized the Risk-Adaptable Access Control (RAdAC) model developed by
McGraw et al. [32] to identify diﬀerent risk components with the operational needs
using the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model. This paper integrated the
ABAC model with the risk-based model to use other user attributes as risk factors.
This paper reviewed open problems in risk-based access control systems and
proposed using market approaches to identify the risk allocation and tolerance for
each organization. The paper utilized the simulation to show the advantages of
risk-based access control that promote security and information sharing.
This paper presented a risk-based access control model and how it can overcome
issues with uncertainty and time-varying security speciﬁcations. The paper utilized
resource sensitivity as a probability distribution, security labels, and clearance level
to estimate the risk using the fuzzy logic system in various real-world situations.

This paper introduced a trust and risk-based access control model by combining trust
and risk as risk factors to enhance data protection and information accessibility. Each
user’s trustworthiness and their related risk values were employed to decide the
access decision.
This paper presented a new learning and risk-based architecture for distributed
policy enforcement under uncertainty. The paper utilized learned classiﬁers of access
control decisions to improve the accuracy of the access decision.
This paper introduced a risk-based model that utilizes user’s beneﬁts rather than
subjective probability as a risk factor to decide the access decision. The authors
demonstrated that game theory can be used as a risk estimation approach to assess
security risks.
The paper [36] proposed a dynamic risk-based decision method. This method used
the user past behavior with the risk history to estimates the security risk value
associated with each access request. Besides, it gave reward and penalty points for
subjects/users after completing a transaction based on the estimated risk value
associated with the transaction. The work presented in [36] was extended in [5] to
involve the process of implementing the risk estimation process to identify good and
bad users based on their past behavior.
This paper proposed a quantiﬁed risk-based model. The risk value is estimated based
on the purpose of access to diﬀerent data sensitivity levels. The risk estimation
process was performed by employing the concept of Shannon entropy from
information theory. A prototype using medical history records was utilized to
illustrate the eﬃciency of their suggested model.
This paper implemented the concept of security risks to identify access decisions by
proposing a risk-based adaptive security framework that employs the game theory as
the risk estimation method to asses risk loses and their future beneﬁts by collecting
contextual information in the healthcare environment.
This paper utilized the risk-based access control model in the federated identity
management process in cloud computing. It utilized the security risk to provide the
access decision and diminish weaknesses and risks when access decisions about
collaboration are made. The paper also proposed a hierarchical risk aggregation
system for cloud federation.
This paper incorporated the security risk with RBAC to build a risk-aware role-based
access control model. In addition, the paper discussed the issues in the proposed
risk-aware model and its implementation procedures.
This paper utilized the risk-based access control model to make access decisions by
utilizing the beneﬁts of access as a risk factor. The paper also proposed an improved
