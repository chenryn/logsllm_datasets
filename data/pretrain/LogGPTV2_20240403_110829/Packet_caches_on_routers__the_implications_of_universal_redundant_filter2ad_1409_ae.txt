We analyzed another ﬂash crowd situation where a smaller frac-
tion of bytes are duplicated across destinations compared to the
baseline situation (ρintra increases from 0.5 to 0.75). The results
in this case are shown in Figure 9(b). We see that the beneﬁts from
redundancy elimination are much better than the ﬁrst situation: the
maximum link loads at f = 3.5X are brought down to 61% with
RA and 68% with SP-RE. The difference between RA and SP-RE
is small because most of the redundancy is conﬁned to trafﬁc within
ingress-egress pairs, and thus redundancy-aware route construction
is not highly beneﬁcial compared to shortest-paths.
Staleness of proﬁles. We conduct a separate analysis of the im-
pact of employing routes computed using stale redundancy proﬁles.
We use real traces corresponding to the high volume /24 preﬁx in
this analysis. We assume that the trafﬁc in the trace originates at
the Chicago PoP in the SprintLink Network (AS1239). We focus
on SprintLink’s intra-domain routes for this trafﬁc. We compute
routes that were optimal for the trace collected at a certain time,
and evaluate the network footprint when using these routes for the
trafﬁc in 5 traces which were collected 10, 20,..., 50 minutes after
the original trace. Figure 10 shows the network footprints from em-
ploying the stale redundancy-aware routes (RA-Stale) to route the
trafﬁc in these 5 traces. We see that RA-Stale is very close to the
optimal (wherein the redundancy-aware routes are computed using
current proﬁles; denoted by RA), and signiﬁcantly better than SP-
RE. We repeated the analysis for traces collected at other times of
the day and observed that RA-Stale always offered reasonable per-
formance. We also changed the source PoP for the trafﬁc to see if
there were topology-related biases in our observations. However,
the performance of RA-Stale was consistently good (See our tech-
nical report [5] for full results). While a more thorough analysis of
the impact of staleness is necessary, these observations seem to in-
dicate that redundancy-aware routes computed at a certain time will
continue to offer reasonable performance for few 10s of minutes.
6.2 Beneﬁts in the Inter-domain Setting
We now present a comparison of the beneﬁts of redundancy aware
routing, simple redundancy elimination, and traditional routing in
the inter-domain context. We assume link capacities are uncon-
strained. We ﬁrst consider an ISP’s local approach for inter-domain
trafﬁc originating from a single PoP in the ISP. Our baseline for
comparison is BGP-based choice of the next-hop AS, with early
exit routing to the next-hop’s peering location.
In Figure 11, we present the reduction in network footprint for
the ATT network (AS7018). The footprint is computed over ATT’s
internal and peering links. We consider inter-domain trafﬁc origi-
nating at a single ATT PoP. We use synthetic traces. The destination
ASes for the inter-domain trafﬁc are modeled along those observed
in real traces: we identify the top 75 destination ASes by volume
in the packet traces for which ATT only has peer-announced routes.
We assume that the trafﬁc volume to these destinations follows a
Zipf distribution. We use Rocketfuel maps to obtain locations where
ATT peers with its neighbors. We used ATT’s public BGP tables to
obtain the preferred next hop ASes for each destination AS.
For the results shown in Figure 11(a) the trafﬁc originates from
the Chicago PoP in the ATT network. We ﬁrst examine the curve
labeled “SP-RE-PrefNeigh” which corresponds to ATT using early-
exit routing internally to reach the BGP-preferred next hop neighbor
for a destination. Simple redundancy elimination is then employed
on all network links. We note that even this simplistic application
of redundancy elimination offers substantial reduction in network
footprint, ranging between 4-50% for a trace where ρoverall = 0.5.
We also study “RA-PrefNeigh”, which corresponds to ATT rout-
ing via the BGP-preferred next hop neighbor, but using a peering lo-
cation which is selected in a redundancy-aware manner. This is not
shown in Figure 11(a) since it offered very similar performance as
SP-RE-PrefNeigh. The similarity arises because ATT is connected
to most of its peers in Chicago, and the exit points chosen by RA-
PrefNeigh are the same as that due to early exit routing.
Next we focus on the curve labeled “RA-RANeigh” where, in a
departure from traditional BGP route selection, ATT makes a selec-
tion of both the next hop neighbor and exit point in a redundancy-
aware manner using the algorithm outlined in Section 4.1. We see
that by making both choices in a redundancy aware fashion, ATT
improves the load on its internal and peering links by 0-11% com-
pared to redundancy-agnostic next hop AS selection (i.e. RA-Pref-
Neigh, which is identical to SP-RE-PrefNeigh).
In Figure 11(b) we plot the distribution of the reduction in net-
work footprint as we vary the ingress PoP in the ATT network. We
see that the beneﬁts of redundancy awareness are very high: in some
cases, RA-RANeigh reduces the network footprint by > 85%.
Note that in contrast to traditional BGP routing, an ISP using
RA-RANeigh may select a peer which has the nearest exit point
as the preferred next hop for a destination. For example, say that
peer A1 is ATT’s BGP-preferred next hop for a destination preﬁx
P and A1’s closest exit point is 10ms away from the source PoP.
Another peer A2 which has also announced route to P has an exit
point which is just 5ms away. RA-RANeigh may prefer A2 over A1
because choosing lower latency internal paths helps RA-RANeigh
reduce the overall network footprint signiﬁcantly.
Next, we examine the beneﬁts of an ISP choosing the next-hop
AS using the following latency-driven approach: among all peers
who have announced a route to a destination, pick the one with
the nearest exit point. The key difference between this and RA-
RANeigh is that the selection of the inter-domain route is not made
in an explicit redundancy-aware manner. We analyze the perfor-
mance of the above latency-based approach to inter-domain route
selection and show the results using the curve labeled “SP-RE-Lat-
Neigh” in Figure 11. Two key points emerge from comparing SP-
RE-LatNeigh against RA-RANeigh: For nearly 20% of the ingresses,
the performance of SP-RE-LatNeigh is close, if not identical, to
RA-RANeigh; In these cases RA-RANeigh selects neighbors with
nearest exit points as the next hops just like SP-RE-LatNeigh does.
For the remaining ingresses, however, selecting neighbors purely
on the basis of the latency to the exit point seems to be quite sub-
optimal. Two factors contribute to the superiority of RA-RANeigh
here: (1) First, selecting a peer with a farther away exit point as
the preferred next hop for a destination may offer better opportu-

nities for aggregating redundant content. For instance, say a peer
A2 has announced a route to some preﬁx P and has an exit point
located 15ms away from the source PoP. Another peer A1 has also
announced a route to P , and has a closer exit point located just 5ms
away. Aggregating on the peering link to A2 all inter-domain trafﬁc
to preﬁx P , together with trafﬁc to other preﬁxes for which only A2
has announced routes, can signiﬁcantly reduce the overall network
footprint. In contrast, simply using A1 to send trafﬁc to P may not
offer similar beneﬁts. (2) Second, RA-RANeigh attempts to aggre-
gate trafﬁc to destinations which share redundant content onto the
same peering links. In contrast, SP-LatNeigh may aggregate desti-
nations across which content is seldom replicated.
Trace-Based Analysis. In Figure 12, we present the results from
our evaluation of the inter-domain local approach using real packet
traces. In Figure 12(a), we present the results for the trafﬁc traces
from the high volume /24 preﬁx, where the overall redundancy pro-
portion was 50%. We observe very signiﬁcant reductions in network
footprint from employing redundancy elimination, irrespective of
whether redundancy-aware routing is used or not. Also, as before,
we note that the difference between SP-LatNeigh and RA-RANeigh
is quite substantial for more than 50% of the ingress PoPs. In Fig-
ure 12(a), we present the results for a full trace of the University
access link, where the redundancy proportion was observed to be
17%. In this case, there was very little duplication of content across
destinations, and hence the beneﬁts from redundancy-awareness are
low relative to simple redundancy elimination.
Cooperative Approach.
In Figure 13(a), we examine the bene-
ﬁts from cooperation between ISPs in computing redundancy aware
routes between each other. We employ synthetic traces in our anal-
ysis. We focus our analysis on the Sprintlink and ATT networks
both of which are tier-1 ISPs. They peer with each other at multi-
ple locations. We consider trafﬁc originating from Chicago in ATT
and going both to PoPs in SprintLink and PoPs in ATT. We assume
that 80% of all trafﬁc originating at Chicago in ATT is inter-domain
trafﬁc, while 20% goes to intra-domain destinations. We considered
other trafﬁc distributions, but the results were qualitatively similar.
As before, we compare RA and SP-RE against SP. We consider
two variants of each approach, namely Opt (for Optimal) and HP
(for Hot Potato). These two variants model a network’s exit point
