If a text field is focused by the user when it is disabled via props, the
input has its focused visual style retained (label and line under the text
remain highlighted in primary color). I tried to work around the issue by
calling .blur() on the underlying input element before setting
disabled={true}, but it appears that calling .blur() on the input also does
not cause the visual styling for TextField to be updated and the input looks
like it is still focused. I am not sure if this is the same or a different
issue.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I'd expect an input to blur when disabled is set to true if it is focused.
Additionally, I'd expect the visual styling to not appear focused when the
input is no longer focused.
## Current Behavior
Setting disabled=true or calling blur on a focused input does not update the
visual styling while the input is focused.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)

  1. Type two characters in the first input to cause it to be disabled.
  2. Click/type in the second input. Notice that both inputs are focused.
