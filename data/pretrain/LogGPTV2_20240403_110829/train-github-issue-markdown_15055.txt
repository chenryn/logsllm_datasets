  * VSCode Version: 1.2.0-insider
  * OS Version: OS X 10.11.5
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Press ⌘K to clear the integrated terminal.
  2. The terminal gets cleared.
  3. __VS Code is still waiting for the second key of the ⌘K chord.__
⌘K is a recognised shortcut for clearing out the terminal on the Mac, but here
it also conflicts with Code's other key bindings.
