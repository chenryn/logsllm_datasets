User: How to connect to remote server via SSH?
Assistant: SSH is a secure protocol used to connect to remote servers over a network. If you want to be able to connect to a remote server via SSH, you can follow these steps: 1. Open a terminal and enter the ssh command. 2. Specify the IP address or hostname of the remote server for the SSH connection. 3. Enter the user name and password to log in to the remote server. 4. After completing the login, you will be able to access and manage the files and applications of the remote server. For example, if you want to connect to a remote server via SSH, you can follow the command: $ ssh username@remote_server_ip_address Then, enter your password to access the remote server. Note that this requires you to configure the SSH service on the remote server to allow external connections. Also, for enhanced security, it is recommended to enable advanced security features such as public key authentication and multi-factor authentication.
