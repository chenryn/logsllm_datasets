User: How to implement security management of container technology, including image management, network isolation, identity authentication, etc.?
Assistant: The security management of container technology includes the following aspects: 1. Image management (1) Only use trusted third-party image sources. (2) Use mirror images from official mirror libraries, and avoid using mirror images from unknown sources or unverified sources. (3) Regularly update the mirror image. (4) Ensure the credibility of the image through the image signature. 2. Network isolation (1) Use network isolation technology to separate the internal network of the container from the external network to ensure the data security of the container. (2) Use a virtual private network (VPC) or VPN to establish a secure network connection. (3) Prohibit containers from accessing sensitive information or sensitive resources. 3. Authentication (1) Use strong passwords and authentication mechanisms in containers. (2) Use standard authentication mechanisms, such as LDAP and Kerberos. (3) It is prohibited to share authentication information or certificates. 4. Container monitoring (1) Monitor the running status and security status of the container in real time. (2) Check and update the security patches of the software in the container in real time. (3) Use container security scanning tools to regularly scan for security vulnerabilities in containers. 5. Others (1) Regularly back up container data for disaster recovery and data recovery. (2) Cover or delete containers that are no longer needed in time to avoid unnecessary security risks. (3) Practice the principle of container minimization, and only install and run necessary applications and services to reduce the attack surface.
