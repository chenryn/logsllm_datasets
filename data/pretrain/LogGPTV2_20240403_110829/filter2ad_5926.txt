INTRODUCTION
Botnets are one of today’s most challenging cybersecurity threats,
and promise to remain a serious threat for many years to come.Bots
today are not limited to sophisticated machines, such as servers and
personal computers: recent DDoS attacks were reportedly utiliz-
ing fridges [3], and other massive scanning activities were using
embedded devices, including IP monitoring cameras and security
doors [5].
Driven by economical proﬁt, botnets are arising in what has been
coined as “Botnet-as-a-Service (BaaS)” [2]. Many of today’s bot-
nets are designed and developed to be loaned easily to third parties.
Reportedly botnet controllers can make a large amount of money
by loaning the service in the mature underground market [4]. Un-
derstanding such phenomena through analysis has been the goal of
the research community for a while to develop effective defense
mechanisms and to guide disinfections.
As the arms race between the malware developers and defend-
ers is endless, it is essential to continuously track and understand
the latest strategies of attackers in manipulating botnets for attacks.
A timely understanding can provide important insights to guide
the building of effective defenses. Therefore, we set to investi-
gate modern botnets from the service perspective, focusing on its
elasticity and stability.
Data analyzed in our study is obtained from the monitoring and
attribution unit in a private security company that is located in the
United States, with partnerships of trafﬁc sharing across the globe.
Malware samples used in launching various attacks are reverse en-
gineered and labeled to a known malware family using best prac-
tices. A honeypot is then created to emulate the operation of the
reverse-engineered malware sample that belongs to a given bot-
net and to enumerate all bots across the globe participating in that
particular botnet. Traces of trafﬁc associated with various botnets
are then collected at various anchor points on the Internet, via the

paigns, concurrently or in turn.
2. BaaS CHARACTERIZATION
We brieﬂy present some preliminary results of our BaaS analy-
sis from the following three perspectives: stability, elasticity, and
collaboration.
2.1 Botnet stability
Similar to the metrics used in [1], we deﬁne the botnet size as the
total number of unique IPs that were once recruited in their lifetime
by the speciﬁc botnet. We ﬁnd that the botnet size of different fam-
ilies varies signiﬁcantly. Based on the botnet size, we can classify
them into 3 different groups from top to down: large, medium
and small (Figure 1).
Figure 1 shows the simultaneous live bots along time for these
three groups. Note the y-axis is in log scale. To some extent, the
simultaneous live bots distribution along time can indicate the sta-
bility of the corresponding botnet family. As shown in the ﬁgure,

besides the difference on the absolute numbers, the results indicate
that the botnets in large group have maintained a relatively stable
army of active bots with a few spikes, while there are more ﬂuctu-
ations in botnets in the medium and small groups. While this
is kind of expected, it also raises a question on whether such sta-
bility in large botnets is due to the same sets of bots being active
or more sophisticated strategies (e.g., bot rotation) have been used
by botnets. Our further investigation (omitted due to space limit)
indicates such stability is not static, but dynamic. That is, the live
bots are being strategically rotated with a short online duration to
maintain such dynamic stability.
2.2 Botnet elasticity
As Figure 1 shows, the number of live bots will surge within a
very limited time frame, usually a couple of days, when the bot-
net is instructed to engage in certain attacks. In our observation, a
well managed botnet could rapidly recruit new bots in the order of
hundreds of thousands. This is another important perspective when
we evaluate the potential of a botnet’s attacking power, particularly
as today botnets are moving towards BaaS. Therefore, we further
deﬁne a metricelasticity of a botnet, which is the ratio of the
maximum over the minimum number of simultaneously live bots.
Figure 2 shows the elasticity result for all families—sorted by
size in descending order. As indicated by the ﬁgure, overall, the
elasticity decreases with the decreasing botnet size. An exception
is Conﬁcker. As Figure 1 shows, compared to other large botnets,
Conﬁcker maintains a very stable army of bots. From the service
perspective, the larger the elasticity value, the more capable a bot-
net is upon a demand for attacks. From the defense perspective, the
more elastic a botnet, the harder to shut it down.
2.3 Service collaborations
For each family, we have a list of botnet identiﬁers derived from
different malware signatures we detected during the 7 months, and
we cross-compare the set of active bots from different botnet iden-
tiﬁers over time.
Some collaborative attacks are concurrent. Some different bot-
net identiﬁers within the same family have extremely high concur-
rent usage over the same set of bots. We speculate the attacker em-
ploys multiple botnets to launch the same attack. Figure 3 shows
an example, demonstrating the collaborations of two botnets within
the Blackenergy family. In this ﬁgure, the x-axis represents daily
timestamps when collaboration happened, the y-axis on the left
represents the index of subnet involved in the collaborations, and
the y-axis on the right represents the the count of bots. For the
scatter plot, each dot with different color shows which botnet the

subnet belongs to at the time of collaborations, and cyan color in-
dicates that they are employed concurrently by both botnets. Three
curves for the total number of bots from each botnet and the num-
ber of collaborating bots are also plotted. From the collaboration
curve and the total count curve, we can clearly see that activities of
both botnets are well synchronized. Also, a dedicated group of bots
that belong to both botnets are responsible for the surge events.
Some botnets take turns in collaborative attacks. We notice
that some different botnet identiﬁers own a large number of the
same bots, but those bots are rarely used concurrently. Instead, they
were solely used by botnet 1 at a time, and later majority of those
bots are transferred to botnet 2. We suspect the same set of bots
are leveraged to participate in different campaigns. This temporal
pattern suggests that different botnets could be controlled by the
same botmaster. They are essentially the same botnet, with some
difference in their code base that resulted in a different signature.
3. DISCUSSION
Botnets have been widely used for various Internet attacks. Driven
by proﬁt, “Botnet-as-a-Service (BaaS)” is on the rise. In this work,
we set to examine botnets from the perspective of services, focus-
ing on the service stability, elasticity, and collaborations. Our re-
sults indicate that to remain active and proﬁtable, BaaS is very ver-
satile and adaptive by constantly and continuously adopting new
techniques, to evade from being detected and to better serve their
underground customers. We are actively conducting in-depth anal-
ysis and we seek to offer more insights to the defense community
in a timely manner.
