### Analysis and Plan for Exploitation

#### Team Members
- Douglas McKee
- Mark Bereza

#### Debugging and Error Handling
- **Watchdog Error Message**: Investigate the watchdog error message to understand the root cause.
- **Binary Patch**: Apply a binary patch to fix the identified issues.

#### Current Situation
- **Execution Control via GOT Overwrite**: We have control over the execution flow by overwriting the Global Offset Table (GOT).
- **Netcat Installed by Default**: Netcat is available on the system, which can be used for network communication.
- **Memory on Heap**: We have access to memory on the heap, which can be used to store and execute shellcode.

#### Objectives
- **Root Access**: Gain administrative privileges on the system.
- **Persistence**: Ensure that our access remains even after reboots or other disruptions.

#### Strategy for Achieving Objectives
1. **Place Shellcode in Controlled Memory**:
   - Inject the shellcode into the memory we control, such as the heap.
2. **Trigger Reverse Shell**:
   - Use the `system()` function to execute the shellcode, initiating a reverse shell connection back to our machine.

#### Detailed Steps
1. **Exploit GOT Overwrite**:
   - Overwrite the GOT entry to redirect the execution flow to our shellcode.
2. **Use Netcat for Communication**:
   - Utilize Netcat to establish a reverse shell connection.
3. **Inject Shellcode**:
   - Place the shellcode in a controlled memory region.
4. **Execute Shellcode**:
   - Call the `system()` function to execute the shellcode, establishing the reverse shell.

#### Additional Considerations
- **Address Calculation**:
  - Use `R4 + offset` to get close to the address of the `system()` function.
- **Relay Control**:
  - The relay turns on when the `ioctl()` call flips the relay.
  - The I/O polling thread calls `canioWriteOutput` to flip the relay.

#### Startup Script Insertion
- **Insert Exploit into Startup Script**:
  - Modify the startup script to include our exploit, ensuring it runs automatically on system boot.

#### Execution Flow
1. **Delta Programming Executes**:
   - The delta programming code runs first.
2. **Dynamic Linker Loads Objects**:
   - The dynamic linker loads the necessary objects in a specific order.
3. **I/O Polling Thread**:
   - The I/O polling thread calls `canioWriteOutput` to flip the relay.

#### Device Information
- **Device ID**: 0x0836004B
- **Device State**: 75.1038
- **Device Description**: "Room Temp"

By following this structured approach, we can achieve our objectives of gaining root access and ensuring persistence on the target system.
