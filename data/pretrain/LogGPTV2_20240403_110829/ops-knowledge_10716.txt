User: How can i get process id of the current process's parent?
In general given a process id how can I get its parent process id?
e.g. os.getpid() can be used to get the proccess id, and os.getppid() for the parent, how do I get grandparent,
My target is linux(ubuntu) so platform specific answers are ok.
Assistant: I do not think you can do this portably in the general case.
You need to get this information from the process list (e.g. through the ps command), which is obtained in a system-specific way.
