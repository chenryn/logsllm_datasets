specific but they are typically small values ranging from, say 0.1% to
5%. Put differently, we use only 0.1% to 5% of kmax (i.e., the number of
impostor biometrics in the dataset S) to estimate the extremely rare
events. Moreover, we hypothesize that the probability density function
of sFMR(w) for very small values of w is contained in Fpow by making
a natural assumption that the local probability distribution around a
fuzzy biometrics x is smooth. That is, we assume that for any fuzzy
∫
biometrics x, any x′ in the vicinity of x occurs with equal probability.
Let д(x) be the distribution of x, i.e., X. Then, when w is small, for
x′∈sAR(w ,x) д(x′)dx′dx ≈
x д(x)wr dx = wr , where r is the size
of the dimension the fuzzy biometric lies in and we used the fact that
f (x) ≈ f (x′).15 Finally, by taking the derivative of wr , we see that
the probability density function of sFMR(w) is included in Fpow.
Subproblem item 2. As explained before, directly estimating ConFMR
is difficult since the sketch being identical is an extremely rare event
and no practical dataset S will contain such samples. Therefore,
we instead provide an empirical evidence that ConFMR can be ap-
proximated by FMR, and indirectly estimate the value of ConFMR by
Recall Sketch is a deterministic function. Let qc(x) be the func-
tion that ignores the proxy key a and simply outputs the sketch c of
(c, a) ← Sketch(x). Then, we can rewrite ConFMR = Prx ,x′←X[x′ ∈
AR(x) | qc(x) = qc(x′)]. Assume the space the sketch c lies in is
endowed with the Euclidean metric (which holds true for all known
linear sketch scheme). Then, for any ℓ ≥ 0, consider a variant of
ConFMR defined as
ℓ-ConFMR :=
sFMR(1) obtained above.

′)) = ℓ],
x ,x′←X[x
Pr
where dist(z, z′) := ∥z − z′∥2. If we can show that ℓ is uncorrelated
to the value of ℓ-ConFMR for all ℓ ≥ 0, then we can ignore the
sketch condition in ConFMR and conclude that ConFMR ≈ FMR =
Prx ,x′←X[x′ ∈ AR(x)]. However, unfortunately, since the condition
on ℓ-ConFMR is still a very rare event, which we cannot expect to
have in our dataset, we still cannot empirically estimate ℓ-ConFMR.
To this end, we further relax the condition in ℓ-ConFMR. For any
large enough integer M, consider a sequence of reals 0 = ℓ0 < · · · <
ℓM such that Prx ,x′←X[dist(qc(x), qc(x′)) ∈ [ℓt−1, ℓt)] = 1/M for
all t ∈ [M]. Then, for each t ∈ [M], we consider the following
alternative variant of ConFMR:
ConFMRt :=
x ,x′←X[x′ ∈ AR(x) | dist(qc(x), qc(x′)) ∈ [ℓt−1, ℓt)].
Pr

Due to how the way we partition the ℓt ’s, ConFMRi is an approxi-
mation of (ℓt−1+ℓt)
-ConFMR. Hence, our goal now is to show that
for all t ∈ [M], the value of ℓt is uncorrelated to the value of
ConFMRt , which in particular approximately establishes that any
ℓ is uncorrelated to ℓ-ConFMR. Concretely, we will perform a hy-
pothesis test using t-statistics on the pair (ℓt , ConFMRt) to conclude

that ConFMRt is not significantly correlated with ℓt . We refer the
standard explanation of statistical t-test to textbooks such as [12].
To perform the statistical t-test, we first prepare the values of
ℓt and ConFMRt for all t ∈ [M]. Since we cannot exactly compute

˜ℓt is simple; we compute dist(qc(x
x′ ∈ ¯S\ ¯S(i) and sort them. That is, we compute the distance of
the sketches of all impostor pairs in S. Let the obtained distances
be L1 ≤ · · · ≤ Lkmax, where recall kmax was the number of total
impostor pairs in S. Then, we set ˜ℓt = L⌊t ·kmax/M⌋ for t ∈ [M].
To estimate ConFMRt , we use the same method used to estimate
FMR to solve subproblem item 1. Namely, we use EVA to estimate
ConFMRt by parameterizing the acceptance region AR. The way the
estimation proceeds is exactly the same as before except that we
condition on the subset of the dataset S so that the distance of the
sketches are within [ ˜ℓt−1, ˜ℓt).

for t ∈ [M]. We perform a hypothesis test against the samples

are uncorrelated. To this end, we first compute the sample correla-
tion coefficient r as

Hence, if p ≥ 0.05, then we conclude with high confidence that
the value of ℓ-ConFMR is uncorrelated with the value of ℓ, and in
particular, approximate ConFMR ≈ FMR ≈sFMR(1).
7 EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS OF OUR FUZZY
SIGNATURE
In this section, we combine all the tools we developed thus far
to show that we can instantiate fuzzy signatures efficiently and
securely using real-world biometrics. In Sec. 7.1, we first conduct
experiments using the statistical methods presented in Sec. 6 with
real-world finger-vein biometrics, and conclude that finger-vein
biometric from a single hand is sufficient for fuzzy signature. Then,
in Sec. 7.2, we instantiate our fuzzy signature with a concrete set of
parameters and provide efficiency analysis of our proposed scheme.
7.1 Estimating Quality of Real-World
Finger-Vein Biometrics
We use real-world finger-veins (see Fig. 11) to show that 4 finger-
vein scans from a single hand is sufficient to instantiate fuzzy sig-
nature. To this end, we provide an appropriate definition of ac-
ceptance region AR and provide experimental results using the
methods presented in Secs. 6.2 and 6.3 to conclude FNMR ⪅ 5% and
ConFMR ⪅ 2−112, respectively.

Example of an extracted
finger-vein image. The image is taken
from [22, Figure 4].
Description of preprocessing and dataset S. There are several pub-
licly available finger-vein datasets such as SDUMLA-HMT [37]
and Hong Kong Polytechnic University Finger Image Database Ver-
sion 1.0 [20]. However, in this work, we use the dataset used by
[36] as they contain the largest number of users and finger-vein
images (roughly 3 to 5 times more).
The finger-vein database contains 505 users where each user
provided images of 6 fingers (index, middle, and ring fingers for
both hands), and the collection for each finger was repeated 3 times
to obtain 3 images (one for the enrollment phase and the other two
for the signing phase). We eliminated 36 users that had finger-veins
images that were not properly scanned. Moreover, since finger-
veins of different fingers from the same user are believed to be
independently distributed (a standard assumption used in many
prior works [23–25, 34]), we can alternatively view the database as
containing (505 − 36) × 6 = 2814 users each providing 3 images of
a single finger-vein.
is represented as a 32-bit float.
We preprocess these raw finger-vein images into data compatible
with our linear sketch (see Sec. 5.4.) We perform feature extrac-
tion on the finger-vein and represent it as an n-dimensional vector
where we experimented with n = 200, 300, 400. For each n, we first
randomly selected 1410 users from the 2814 users and performed
principal component analysis [2] to extract the n-dimensional sub-
space that best explains the data. Then, we projected the remaining
1404 users’ finger-vein onto the n-dimensional subspace and pre-
pared the dataset S = { x
}(i ,j)∈[1404]×[0:2]. Each n-dimensional
vector x
Type of AR. We consider a regular hexagon as the acceptance region
AR since we use the triangular lattice to instantiate the linear sketch
scheme (see Fig. 6 and Sec. 5.3). Denote d as the basis length of the
triangular lattice (see App. D). Then, since the triangular lattice
uniquely defines AR, the value of d indirectly parameterizes AR;
a larger d results in a larger region for AR. Therefore, given the
dataset S, we find the value d that provides us with an AR that
satisfies the conditions FNMR ⪅ 5% and ConFMR ⪅ 2−112. Note
the concrete value of d has no significant meaning as its length is
relative to the scaling of the concrete fuzzy biometrics.
Estimating FNMR and ConFMR. We use 4 finger-veins for the fuzzy
signature16 and since each finger-vein is assumed to be distributed
independently, we empirically evaluate whether the following holds
for each n = 200, 300, 400:
• FNMR ≤ 1 − (1 − 5%)1/4 ≈ 2−6.29 (see Eq. (2))
• ConFMR ≤ (2−112)1/4 = 2−28 (see Eq. (3))
• p-value is larger than 0.05 (see Eq. (5))
Here, the first item follows from the fact that we need all 4 finger-
veins to be correct to obtain a total of 5% of false non-matching
rate. Moreover, the last requirement is to check the validity of our

they generalize to multiple independent biometric sources. For completeness, details
are provided in App. E.

For each dimension n, we varied the basis length d (i.e., acceptance
region AR) to see its effect. For each dimension n, we chose three
respectively. Although 112-bits is the recommended security level
for fuzzy signatures, we also benchmarked 80-bits of security since
80-bits may suffice in adversarially restricted scenarios, e.g., the
system blocks the account after a few false attempts at signing. We
also included the correlation coefficient r of the t-test (see (Eq. (4)))
to show that their absolute values are all below 0.2.

relation coefficient of the t-test, and d denotes the basis length of

The entries in bold-fonts in Sec. 7.1 indicate those satisfying
either ConFMR4 ≤ 2−112 orFNMR4 ≤ 5%. When the dimension of
on ConFMR4 andFNMR4 are satisfied. Therefore, our result indicates
the feature vectors of the finger-vein is n = 300 (resp. n = 400) and
when the basis length is d = 40.2 (resp. d = 40.3), both conditions
that 4 finger-veins are sufficient to provide the required properties
to instantiate fuzzy signatures by taking those appropriate choices
of n and d. Since a larger dimension n leads to a less efficient linear
sketch scheme, taking n = 300 suffices. In addition, our experimen-
tal results also confirm the relationship between the size of AR and
the tradeoff between ConFMR4 andFNMR4. Observe that decreasing
the size of AR (i.e., smaller d) has the effect of lowering ConFMR4
while increasingFNMR4 as expected; a smaller AR makes it harder to
error. We note that although the false non-matching rate (FNMR4) is
128-bits, then we can achieve this by increasingFNMR4.
typically set below 5 % in practice, we can tolerate a higher value of
correctness error by allowing the signer to repeat until it succeeds.
Therefore, in case we require a higher level of security such as
impersonate while it also makes it more sensitive to measurement
To see more closely the effect of varying the dimension n, we
plot the detection error tradeoff (DET) curve [15, Sec. 4.7]. The case
for n = 200 and 300 is provided in Fig. 12. We refer the case for
n = 400 to App. F.2 since it is similar to n = 300. For each dimension
n, the DET curve is plotted by varying the size of d (hence AR). Any
region that lies above the DET curve is realizable. For instance, since
