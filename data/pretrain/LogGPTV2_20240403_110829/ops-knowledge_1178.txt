Question: "Imagine you are a security consultant advising a client on the use of Certificate Authorities (CAs) for their web application. The client seeks to understand the risks and trust model associated with CAs in securing web communications. Which of the following statements accurately reflect aspects of this model and its potential risks?"
 "A": "The more CAs that are trusted by a browser, the lower the risk of a security breach, as this diversification means that trust is not concentrated in a single entity."
 "B": "A web application that buys a digital certificate from a CA ensures secure communication since the certificate links the domain to its public key, which browsers validate using the issuing CA's public key."
 "C": "If any one of the many trusted CAs behaves maliciously or issues a certificate to the wrong person, it could compromise the security of all web users."
 "D": "The CA's role is to maintain an online directory service that is less scalable, reliable, and useful than digital certificates, which is why they are not widely used today."
