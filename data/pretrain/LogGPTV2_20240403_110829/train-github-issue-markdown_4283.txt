I notice that it exists a country form type that display a list of countries
using the Intl bundle.
This form type is very usefull, but there is no easy way to restrict the
countries available. For example if I want the user to select a country into a
predefined list, it is currently not possible (except creating a custom choice
form type).
What would be wonderfull is that we can configure a list of predefined
countries by sending an array containing the countries ISO code (array('uk',
'fr', 'it', 'es') for example) And the component will generate the list
translating those ISO code into user language country name.
NOTE: This could also be applied to language form type.
