Here's a clear definition of set equality. One sees that order is not explicit
at all.  
https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Set_Equality  
Two sets are equal iff they contain the same elements:  
∀x:(x∈A⟺x∈B)⟺A=B  
The order of the elements in the sets is immaterial.
Is there a way to reopen this topic?  
(Edited note: I eliminated the reference to commutativity and associativity of
symmetric difference since it is irrelevant to set equality)
the youtube video presented in case #1358 does not demonstrate at all that
ordering matters.
I think the equality of sets is independent of order. {1,2,3} = {3,2,1}

Please also note that according to the site above that is also true that:  
{1, 2, 3} = {3, 2, 1, 1}, that is duplications do NOT make any difference for
sets.
