## getInitialProps that with dynamic import, ssr is ok, but have errors in
client side
**pages/index.js**
    import React from "react";
    import dynamic from "next/dynamic";
    class Index extends React.Component {
      static async getInitialProps() {
        return { Hello: dynamic(import("../components/hello")) };
      }
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        console.log("props:", props);
      }
      render() {
        const { Hello } = this.props;
        console.log(this.props);
        return (
        );
      }
    }
    export default Index;`
**components/hello.js**
    export default class hello extends React.Component{
    render () 
    {
        return (
          Hello Next.js
        )
      }
    }
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. just start run the dev npm script
  2. http://localhost:3000
  3. looks fine, but you will get lots of error in the browser console
## Expected behavior
i log out the props in the render method on purpose, we can see the content in
compiler console, but got nothing in client side console.

## System information
  * OS:Windows10
  * Browser: chrome
  * Version of Next.js:7.0.2
## Additional context
if we don't use dynamic import but do some simple data api request in
getInitialProps, we found that the data recorded inside props would keeped in
both server and client side, hope the componens that dynamic import can also
shared both server side and client side
