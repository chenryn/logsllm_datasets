#### What is RDI?
**Reflected DOM Injection (RDI)** is a technique where a malicious script is injected into a web page's Document Object Model (DOM) in a way that it only executes under specific conditions. This makes it challenging to detect and mitigate.

#### A Recipe for Disaster
To demonstrate the potential of RDI, consider the following components:
- **1 simple web page**
- **1 trustworthy web utility**
- **1 script that behaves differently within a certain context**
- **2 cups of funny cat pictures**

#### RDI in Action ‚Äì Yahoo Cache
- **Yahoo Cache** can be used to store and serve web pages.
- When a user visits a cached page, the malicious script can be executed if the conditions are met.

**What Just Happened?!**
- The user accessed a cached version of a web page, which contained a malicious script.
- The script was only activated under specific conditions, making it difficult to detect.

#### Let‚Äôs Take it a Step Further
- **Google Translate** can also be exploited using RDI.
- By generating a malicious URL "hosted" on Google Translate, we can bypass security measures and execute the script directly.

**Example:**
```
http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=iw&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fhandei.ueuo.com%2Ftran.html
```

**Behind the Scenes:**
- The content is translated.
- After translation, the malicious code is generated, decrypted, and executed.

#### Let‚Äôs Check Out the Code
- **Script**: 
  - **Generated**: The malicious script is created.
  - **Decrypted**: The script is decrypted.
  - **Executed**: The script runs, performing its intended malicious action.

#### Reflected DOM Injection (RDI)
- **RDI is a technique** that leverages the context of the web page to inject and execute malicious scripts.
- **Context makes the difference**: The script only executes under specific conditions, making it hard to detect.
- **Very hard to detect**: Traditional security tools often fail to identify RDI.
- **RDI is powerful and effective** for conducting targeted attacks.

#### VirusTotal / Wepawet
- **VirusTotal** and **Wepawet** are useful tools for detecting and analyzing malware, but they may not always catch RDI due to its contextual nature.
