### Stream Analytics: Description and Rationale

| Control | Severity | Automated Fix Script | Description and Rationale |
|---------|----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Medium | Yes | No | Granting minimum access through RBAC ensures that users are provided with just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes the exposure of resources in the event of a user or service account compromise. |
| **Diagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days** | Medium | Yes | No | Logs should be retained for a sufficient period to allow activity trails to be recreated during investigations following an incident or compromise. A one-year retention period is standard for many compliance requirements. |
| **Backup must be planned for Stream Analytics job queries** | Medium | No | No | Stream Analytics does not provide built-in features for backup and disaster recovery. Therefore, it is essential to have adequate backups of critical Stream Analytics queries to ensure data integrity and availability. |
| **Alert rules must be configured for Runtime Errors and Failed Functions** | High | Yes | No | Configuring alert rules helps ensure high availability of important or critical services by monitoring jobs and providing alerts for runtime errors and job failures. |
| **Paired Regions should be configured for disaster recovery** | Low | No | No | Paired regions help maintain consistent availability of a Stream Analytics-based solution in the event of an outage (e.g., throttling, storage issues, subsystem failure) in the primary region. |

This table outlines the key controls, their severity levels, and whether they can be automatically fixed. The rationale for each control is provided to help you understand the importance and context of each requirement.
