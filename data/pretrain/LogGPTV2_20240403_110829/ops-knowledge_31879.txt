User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to reconcile user with both on-premise and cloud mailboxes? We are in the middle of hybrid coexistence migration from Exchange 2010 on-premise to Office 365. That means we have ADFS and "Dirsync" (now called Windows Azure AD Sync) running. We are more than halfway through migrating mailbox, so about 60% of our users' mailboxes are in the cloud and the remaining 40% or so are still in on-premise Exchange 2010 databases.

Today we discovered that one of our users has both an on-premise and an Office 365 mailbox linked to his one AD account. That means that if he opens Outlook on a domain-joined computer and goes through the initial configuration, it uses autodiscover to connect him to his on-premise mailbox, but if he logs on to the Office 365 portal, it shows his cloud mailbox.

Even worse, when a user whose mailbox is in the cloud sends him an e-mail, it goes only to his cloud mailbox, and when a user whose mailbox is still on-premise, it goes only to his on-premise mailbox. So he can't see all his mail all in one place.

How can we "merge" his mail data (final destination: Office 365) and make sure his Outlook "autodiscovers" the Office 365 mailbox and all mail is routed to that mailbox?

Assistant: I've the same problem in my domain.
Someone manually create the o365 mailbox for users who already have an on-premise mailbox

I've found this way to fix it:


Export office 365 mailbox in PST
Remove office 365 user license (this will remove his cloud mailbox)
Remove office 365 user from office 365 AD:


Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName youruser@youroffice365domain.com -Force
Remove-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName youruser@youroffice365domain.com -RemoveFromRecycleBin -Force

DirSync (recreate user in office 365 AD)
Reassign the office 365 license for the user
Migrate user to office 365
Restore PST


I think is more simple and straightforward.
You can also re-migrate your mailbox on-prem (offboarding) if you need it.
