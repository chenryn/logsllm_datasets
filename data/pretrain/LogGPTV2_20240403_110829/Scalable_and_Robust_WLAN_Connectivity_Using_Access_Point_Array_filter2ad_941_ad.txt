(b) Dynamic load balancing (DLB)
Figure 4. The measured throughput of each AP over time under a synthetic trafﬁc load when SLB or
DLB is used.
In DLB, The load is more
evenly distributed. The algorithm’s adaptation to trafﬁc load change is responsive and stable.
In SLB, The load is not distributed evenly among the APs.
around 5.4 Mbps throughput. Then we turned on all nine
TCP connections at full speed and measured the maximum
throughput of each AP. In this case, three APs (channels)
are active, and thus can potentially interfere with one an-
other, despite the fact that they operate in non-overlapped
channels. The throughput measurements for this case are
shown in the fourth and ﬁfth column of Table 1. This test
shows that signals in even non-overlapped channels can still
interfere with one another. This inter-channel interference
could lead to a throughput loss of around 500 Kbps when 3
channels are used. As a result, the maximum throughput for
a 3-AP WLAN load balancing system is around 15.7 Mbps.
4.3. Synthetic Trafﬁc Test
To test the effectiveness and responsiveness of the pro-
posed WLAN load balancing algorithm, we use the fol-
lowing synthetic trafﬁc. One TCP connection is created
from source-computer to each STA. The transmission rate
of these TCP connections changes every 120 seconds (2
minutes) according to Table 2. The total trafﬁc load of all
STAs always remains at 15 Mbps. We divided this 15 Mbps
into 9 components randomly, but limited each component
to 6.5 Mbps. Then we sorted these 9 components and as-
sign them to STAs in order. When a STA’s injected trafﬁc
load exceeds 5.5 Mbps, it saturates its AP and the AP is the
bottleneck. When a STA’s injected trafﬁc load is less than
5.5 Mbps, it simulates constant bit rate (CBR) trafﬁc. We
measured the aggregate throughput of the three APs over
time for both static load balancing (SLB) and dynamic load
balancing (DLB). SLB uses the static load balancing conﬁg-
uration as in the baseline test. In DLB, WLB runs the load
balancing algorithm to dynamically adjust the STA-to-AP
association based on observed trafﬁc load.
Figure 4 shows the measured trafﬁc load of each of three
APs over time for SLB and DLB. Under SLB, the load
among APs is as skewed as the input load. Either AP1 is
overloaded or AP3 is overloaded, while other APs are un-
derloaded. Under DLB, the load is distributed more evenly
among the APs, and as a result their utilization is almost al-
ways high. In the ﬁrst 20 seconds of Figure 4(b), DLB is
disabled. So the trafﬁc load among APs is similar to Figure
4(a). After the ﬁrst 20 seconds, DLB is enabled. The trafﬁc
load of underloaded APs quickly increases because WLB
move some load from the overloaded AP to them. When
the trafﬁc rate of STAs changes, the algorithm can adjust
the STA-to-AP association quickly. It only takes around 2
or 3 control intervals to reach a stable state. Moreover, after
the load is balanced, the system throughput is stable until
the input trafﬁc load distribution starts to change.

DLB can achieve aggregate throughput of nearly 15
Mbps most of the time while SLB can only achieve around
7.6 Mbps. That is, the maximum aggregate throughput is
almost doubled with DLB when compared with SLB. The
synthetic trafﬁc is generated completely randomly and is
not designed speciﬁcally to expose the weakness of SLB.
The results of this experiment show that DLB is more robust
than SLB against a wide variety of trafﬁc loads because it
can always make the best of the resources on all the APs.
4.4. Real-World Trafﬁc Test
For DLB to be useful, the input trafﬁc load distribution
among APs needs to be skewed, and trafﬁc load can be
moved easily among APs. The question is whether real-
world trafﬁc exhibits these characteristics. To answer this
question, we collected a 12-hour TCP packet trace on the
external link of the Experimental Computer Systems Lab
(ECSL) of Stony Brook University. For each TCP con-
nection, we record its start time (start-time), the IP address
(ip-address) of the end host in ECSL, and the data volume
(data-volume). To play back a TCP connection, we started
a TCP connection at its start-time from source-computer to
the STA whose ID is equal to (ip-address % number-of-
STAs). The connection then transfers the same volume of
data as its data-volume. The total number of TCP connec-
tions and the total data volume in the trace are 9446 and
569 Mbytes. To really stress the 3-AP array, we speed up
the replay speed by a factor of 48 so that each TCP con-
nection’s start time is changed to (start-time / 48). Other
speedup factors that allow the trace replay to be completed
in one hour also shows similar results. In the trace, there are
only several large TCP connections (between 30 Mbytes to
80 Mbytes). Most TCP connections are just HTTP requests
whose data volume is very small.
We measured the aggregate throughput of the three APs
over time under SLB and DLB, and the results are shown in
Figure 5. In the beginning of the trace, SLB and DLB show
similar aggregate throughput because the trafﬁc demand is
smaller than one AP’s maximum throughput. Therefore, us-
ing multiple APs doesn’t help regardless of whether DLB or
SLB is used. At time 175 second, the ﬁrst large-volume
TCP connections start, and DLB immediately brings the
aggregate throughput to around 15 Mbps, while SLB’s
throughput remains at 7 Mbps. At time 240 second, DLB’s
aggregate throughput drops to 10 Mbps, because there are
only 2 large-volume TCP connections and there is no much
room for DLB to move the trafﬁc load around.
At time 305 second, the throughput of DLB is lower than
SLB. However, this throughput is also lower than one AP’s
maximum throughput. This means that at this time, DLB is
done with servicing the TCP connections that start at time
175 second. The throughput of SLB is still high because
its low throughput between 175 second and 305 second re-
quires it to spend longer time to service the same TCP con-
nections. The aggregate throughput between 525 second
and 835 second shows similar patterns as the time between
175 second and 455 second. SLB is able to achieve around
10 Mbps throughput at time between 525 second and 610

second, because the two high-demand STAs happen to be
associated with two different APs. Between time 835 sec-
ond and 900 second, the throughput curves of SLB and DLB
are close to each other, and the trafﬁc load is higher than
one AP’s maximum throughput. DLB cannot out-perform
SLB in this case because there is only one high-bandwidth-
demand STA and so DLB cannot effectively distribute the
load.
One advantage of DLB over SLB is that it reduces the
length of the congestion period. For SLB, the congestion
period due to the large-volume TCP connections at time 175
(525) second lasts for 280 (310) seconds. In contrast, DLB
shortens the same congestion period by a factor of two to
130 (125) seconds. Furthermore, by moving STAs away
from overloaded APs, DLB decreases the number of STAs
that are adversely affected by large-volume TCP connec-
tions.
In summary, real-world Internet trafﬁc tends to be highly
bursty although the bandwidth demand is generally low
most of the time. When large-volume TCP connections ap-
pear, congestion can last for several minutes even on 11-
Mbps 802.11b network. In these cases, DLB helps by re-
ducing the length of the congestion period and/or by de-
creasing the number of STAs affected by these connec-
tions. However, DLB is not always effective, especially
when there is only one large-volume TCP connection that
causes a trafﬁc burst. When this happens, DLB cannot do
much to increase throughput as moving the large-volume
TCP connection to a different AP cannot eliminate the load
skew.

5. Conclusion and Future Work
Given the rapid growth of IEEE 802.11-based wireless
LAN technology, it appears likely that it will become as
dominant for wireless systems/applications as Ethernet is
for the wired world. Despite many advantages, the sus-
tained throughput of 802.11 WLAN link is still quite limited
especially when compared with Ethernet. One way to in-
stantly improve the throughput of a WLAN access network
is to fully exploit the radio spectrum, more speciﬁcally the
non-overlapped frequency channels in 802.11a and 802.11b
standards.
This paper advocates a WLAN access point array archi-
tecture to improve the overall throughput and fault tolerance
of wireless access networks that are required in large audi-
toriums, conference rooms, and other public places where
the number of users is high. Similar to using multiple disks
in a redundant disk array, the WLAN access point array
uses multiple inexpensive commodity access points, each
of which operates in a different channel, to achieve scal-
able and robust wireless connectivity. The key enabling
technology for the proposed WLAN access point array is a
dynamic load balancing mechanism that takes into account
trafﬁc load distribution, the transmission rate of individual
STAs, AP interference and failures. The WLB described in
this paper implemented exactly such a mechanism.
Although load balancing is conceptually simple, sup-
porting it in the context of a WLAN AP array is surpris-
ingly challenging because of issues concerning load esti-
mate, different transmission rate, etc. We discuss the de-
sign and implementation issues of WLAN load balancing,
and how we address these issues. Although limited load
balancing features start to appear in commercial wireless
switches and APs, we believe this paper is the ﬁrst com-
prehensive study on the effectiveness of trafﬁc load-based
WLAN load balancing schemes. Moreover, the WLB pro-
totype described in this paper is the ﬁrst and perhaps only
WLAN load balancer that can inter-operate with commod-
ity APs and standard STAs. Empirical measurements col-
lected on this working prototype show that the proposed
load balancing algorithms and their implementations indeed
produce substantial improvement in aggregate throughput
and robustness when compared with static load balancing
schemes.
There are several directions we are currently pursuing
to further the WLAN load balancing technology. First, the
current WLAN AP array architecture assumes that APs are
collocated for the WLB to monitor the load of APs and
STAs. Another possible conﬁguration is that APs are not
collocated but they can have overlapped coverage area. We
are exploring the possibility of generalizing the load bal-
ancing algorithms described in this paper to that conﬁgu-
ration. Second, the current WLAN load balancer uses a
static channel assignment algorithm that can choose a set of
non-overlapped channels which minimize the interference
between itself and neighboring WLAN AP arrays. We are
exploring the possibility of dynamically changing the chan-
nels assigned to the APs so as to make the best of channels
that lie idle at any point in time. Third, the current WLAN
load balancer does not attempt to minimize packet loss due
to forced handoff that results from assigning a STA to a dif-
ferent AP. If the WLB supports packet buffering, it can com-
pletely eliminate the performance loss due to handoff, and
thus provides more freedom in the design of the STA-to-AP
mapping algorithm. Finally, we plan to port the proposed
load balancing algorithms to commercial access points such
as Linksys WRT54G, and incorporate more sophisticated
load balancing features that become feasible when modify-
ing the APs is an acceptable option.
