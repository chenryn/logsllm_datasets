This issue has been around for quite a while, and I just reproduced it in
0.14.4 and 0.15.1-alpha.1. I looked through all "button" and "ripple" related
issues and found no mention of this, so apologies if this is a duplicate.

As you can see, this is the latest version of the demos on material-ui.com.
Video was taken in chrome on a mac.
Basically, through some sequence of clicks the ripple effect doesn't go away.
I've been playing around with it for quite a while and couldn't find
consistent repro steps. It also seems to happen much more often on chrome in
android as well as safari in iOS. I've noticed this issue in all browsers.
