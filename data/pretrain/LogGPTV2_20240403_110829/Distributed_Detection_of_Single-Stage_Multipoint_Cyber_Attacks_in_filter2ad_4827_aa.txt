ABSTRACT
A distributed detection method is proposed to detect single
stage multi-point (SSMP) attacks on a Cyber Physical Sys-
tem (CPS). Such attacks aim at compromising two or more
sensors or actuators at any one stage of a CPS and could to-
tally compromise a controller and prevent it from detecting
the attack. However, as demonstrated in this work, using
the ﬂow properties of water from one stage to the other, a
neighboring controller was found eﬀective in detecting such
attacks. The method is based on physical invariants de-
rived for each stage of the CPS from its design. The attack
detection eﬀectiveness of the method was evaluated exper-
imentally against an operational water treatment testbed
containing 42 sensors and actuators. Results from the exper-
iments point to high eﬀectiveness of the method in detecting
a variety of SSMP attacks but also point to its limitations.
Distributing the attack detection code among various con-
trollers adds to the scalability of the proposed method.

INTRODUCTION
1.
A Cyber Physical System (CPS) consists of a physical pro-
cess controlled by a computation and communications in-
frastructure. Typically, a CPS consists of multiple stages,
where each stage is controlled by a Programmable Logic
Controller (PLC). Each PLC controls a subprocess. The
control actions are based on the current state of the system
obtained through a network of sensors, and alter the process

state. For example, in a water treatment system, a PLC may
start a pump to ﬁll a tank with water. The pump must be
stopped when the tank reaches a predetermined high level.
The level of water in the tank is known to the PLC through
a level sensor. At any instant, the PLCs receive data from
sensors, compute control actions, and apply these actions to
speciﬁc devices commonly referred to as actuators.
CPS under cyber attack: The communications infrastruc-
ture of a CPS, often using wireless communications, could
be connected to an external network. Such connections ren-
der a CPS susceptible to cyber attacks. Such attacks could
compromise one or more of the communications links be-
tween sensors, actuators and the PLCs, as well as across the
PLCs and SCADA. Each such link is considered as an at-
tack point in the CPS. Once a link has been compromised,
an attacker could use one of several strategies to send fake
state (sensor) data to one or more PLCs, or bypass the PLC
and directly control an actuator. Unless the defense mecha-
nism of the attacked CPS is robust, such attacks could cause
an undesirable response that may lead to system shutdown
and/or device damage. Examples of such strategic attacks
are given in Section 4. Thus, it becomes imperative for
design engineers to understand how an attack might bring
about anomalous behavior and how could these be detected.
Problem setting: It is assumed that the CPS under attack
consists of multiple stages where each stage is controlled by
a PLC, and that PLCs are able to communicate over a net-
work. Each stage of the CPS contains sensors and actuators,
each referred to here as an entity. This general architecture
of a CPS is found in water treatment plants and several
other Industrial Control Systems (ICS1). Further, it is as-
sumed that an attacker has access to any one stage of the
CPS. Thus, the attacker could compromise one or more en-
tities in any one stage to which access is available. This is a
reasonable assumption as in a complex CPS, e.g., a public
utilities plant, PLCs are often distributed. Thus, attacking
more than one stage at the same time might not be feasi-
ble especially when done using an IoT2 device. A stage is
considered compromised if all sensors and actuators in that
stage are compromised. When some, but not all sensors and
actuators are compromised, the stage is considered partially
compromised. Such attacks are referred to as single-stage

this work. This generic attack scenario becomes realistic in
the presence of system vulnerabilities or when a disgruntled
insider has access to a speciﬁc stage of the CPS. The prob-
lem of attack detection can now be brieﬂy stated as follows.
What software mechanism will be able to detect SSMP at-
tacks on the CPS given that any one stage is partially or
completely compromised ?
It is noted that in a complex ICS, there could be many
ways of launching SSMP attacks.
In this work the focus
is on malicious manipulation of sensor data, or the status
of actuators via a man-in-the-middle attack.
In a water
treatment system, the intention of each such attack is to
cause a tank to overﬂow or a reduction in the performance
measured as gallons of water produced per minute. The
use of invariants in this paper has similarities with the work
reported in [14, 15, 8, 16, 17]. This aspect is discussed in
more detail in Section 7. Attacks such as injecting malware
into a PLC, denial of service, are not considered in this work.
Contributions: (a) A distributed mechanism for the detect-
ing cyber attacks on a water treatment system (Section 5.2).
(b) Experimental assessment of this mechanism in a realistic
testbed (Section 5). (c) Two open problems relevant to the
design of secure CPS (Section 8).
Organization: The remainder of this work is organized as
follows. Section 2 presents a model of CPS for the applica-
tion of distributed attack detection (also referred to as DaD)

derstand the remainder of this paper, is also in this section.

scenarios, and attacks considered in the experiments are in

2. MODELLING A CPS
The ﬁrst step in the proposed procedure is to construct a
suitable model of a CPS. A general architecture of a CPS
and the modelling procedure based on this architecture, are
described next.
2.1 Structure of a CPS
CPS, such as power grid and water treatment systems, con-
sist of a distributed supervisory control system. The control
system itself is a collection of stages each controlling a spe-
ciﬁc portion of the CPS. It is assumed that each stage has
one PLC responsible to control the subprocess associated
with that stage. This architecture is exhibited in Figure 1.
As shown, the PLC at each stage communicates with a set
of sensors and actuators , labelled as S and A, respectively,
via a local communications network. This local network is
considered to be at Level 0 and is also referred to as the
ﬁeld-bus network [18]. It could be, for example, a ring net-
work across which sensors send local state information to
the PLC and PLCs in turn send control command to the
actuators. Note that state information is local to a stage,
i.e., to a PLC. Level 1 network is used to share state data
among the PLCs. Control commands to alter the state of
an actuator are sent to actuators by the respective PLCs.
Actuators often contain sensors used by a PLC to obtain its
state. Such sensors are included in set S shown in Figure 1.
The PLCs themselves communicate among each other using
the Level 1 network.
Each PLC contains a control program that receives data,
computes control actions and applies these to the actuators
it controls. Computation of control actions are based on
a condition evaluated using data received from the sensors.
This could be a simple condition involving data from one
sensor, or a compound condition involving data from multi-
ple sensors some of which might require communication with
other PLCs.
2.2 Testbed architecture
An operational water treatment plant , referred to as SWaT,
was used to conduct experiments reported here. SWaT pro-
duces 5 gallons/hr of ﬁltered water. It mimics a large mod-
ern water treatment plant found in cities. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, SwaT consists of six stages labeled 1 through 6. Each
stage is controlled by its own set of dual PLCs, one serving
as a primary and the other as a backup in case of any fail-
ure of the primary. Details of SWaT components including
sensors and actuators, can be found in [19].
Communications: Each PLC obtains data from sensors as-
sociated with the corresponding stage, and controls sensors
and actuators in its domain. Turning the pumps ON, or
opening a valve, causes water to ﬂow either into or out of a
tank. Level sensors in each tank inform the PLCs when to
turn a pump ON or OFF. Several other sensors are available
to check the physical and chemical properties of water ﬂow-
ing through the six stages. PLCs communicate with each
other through a separate network; both wired and wireless
modes of operation are available.
Stages in SWaT: Stage P1 controls the inﬂow of water to
be treated by opening or closing a valve that connects the
inlet pipe to the raw water tank. Water from the raw water
tank is pumped via a chemical dosing (stage P2) station to
another Ultraﬁltration (UF) Feed water tank in stage P3.
In stage P3 a UF feed pump sends water, via UF unit, to
a Reverse Osmosis (RO) feed water tank in stage P4.
In
P4 an RO feed pump sends water through an ultraviolet
dechlorination unit controlled by a PLC in stage P4. This
step is necessary to remove any free chlorine from the water
prior to passing it through the reverse osmosis unit in stage
P5. Sodium bisulphate (NaHSO3) can be added in stage P4
to control the ORP3. In stage P5 the dechlorinated water
is passed through a 2-stage RO ﬁltration unit. The ﬁltered
water from the RO unit is stored in the permeate tank and
the reject in the UF backwash tank. Stage P6 controls the
cleaning of the membranes in the UF unit by turning ON
or OFF the UF backwash pump. The backwash cycle is ini-
tiated automatically once every 30 minutes and takes less
than a minute to complete. Diﬀerential pressure sensors in
stage P3 measure the pressure drop across the UF unit. A
backwash cycle is also initiated when the pressure drop ex-
ceeds 0.4 bar indicating that the membranes need immediate
cleaning. A diﬀerential pressure meter, installed in stage P3,
is used by PLC3 to obtain the pressure drop across the UF
unit.

sensors and actuators at a stage. A sensor used to obtain the state of an actuator is considered a part of set S.
Figure 2: Six stages in SWaT with corresponding PLCs, sensors, and actuators; only the leftmost four stages are used
in the case study reported here. The attack detectors described in Section 5.2, are placed inside PLC1 through PLC4;
PLC5 and PLC6 were not used in this case study. There are ﬁve water storage tanks as shown, and are labeled Txxx.
Water level in each tank is measured by the corresponding level indicator labeled as LITxxx.
Sensors and actuators: In all SWaT consists of 42 sensors
and actuators distributed across the six stages. These in-
clude sensors that relate to the physics of the process such
as water level in tanks, ﬂow indicators, and pressure indi-
cators. In addition there are sensors that measure chemical
properties of water including pH, conductivity and hardness.
Each PLC has its own set of sensors and actuators connected
through a ring network. Thus, when a PLC needs to obtain
state information from another PLC, it must request such
information via a suitable command; the requested data is
sent over Level 1 network.
Attack points in SWaT: An attack point is a speciﬁc com-
ponent or a communication link.
In this case study only
the wireless links between sensors and the corresponding
PLCs are considered as attack points. A pessimistic ap-
proach is taken implying that all wireless links are assumed
to be vulnerable to cyber attacks. Initial experiments, not
described here, revealed that indeed, wireless communica-
tions in SWaT are vulnerable. Table 1 lists the sensors and
actuators in SWaT used in the study reported here.
2.3 Sensor and actuator sets
The attack detection method, described in Section 5.2,
uses state-based invariants. The variables used in the in-
variants are listed in Table 1. The output of sensor i and
the state of actuator j, are represented by, respectively, state
variables vi and vj. For example, from Table 1, v2 denotes
the state of sensor LIT101 that indicates the level of water
in tank T101. Similarly, the state of pump P101 is indicated
by variable v4.
An ideal ﬂow meter would report the ﬂow rate as 0 when
no water ﬂows through the pipe to which the meter is con-
nected. However, in practice, the output of ﬂow meters used
in SWaT was found to be greater than 0 even when no wa-
ter was ﬂowing through the pipe. Hence, the condition “no
ﬂow” was checked using parameter δ > 0. δ was determined
experimentally to ensure that the “no ﬂow” and “ﬂow” states
