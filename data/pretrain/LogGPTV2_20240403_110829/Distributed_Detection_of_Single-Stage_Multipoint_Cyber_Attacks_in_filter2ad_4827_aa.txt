## Abstract
This paper proposes a distributed detection method to identify single-stage multi-point (SSMP) cyber attacks on a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). Such attacks target two or more sensors or actuators at a single stage, potentially compromising the controller and preventing it from detecting the attack. However, by leveraging the flow properties of water between stages, a neighboring controller can effectively detect such attacks. The method is based on physical invariants derived for each CPS stage from its design. The effectiveness of the attack detection method was evaluated experimentally using an operational water treatment testbed with 42 sensors and actuators. Results indicate high effectiveness in detecting various SSMP attacks but also highlight some limitations. Distributing the attack detection code among multiple controllers enhances the scalability of the proposed method.

## 1. Introduction
A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates a physical process with a computational and communication infrastructure. Typically, a CPS consists of multiple stages, each controlled by a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Each PLC manages a subprocess, making control decisions based on the current system state, which is obtained through a network of sensors and applied to actuators. For example, in a water treatment system, a PLC may start a pump to fill a tank with water and stop it when the tank reaches a predetermined high level, as indicated by a level sensor.

### 1.1 CPS Under Cyber Attack
The communication infrastructure of a CPS, often involving wireless communications, can be connected to external networks, making it vulnerable to cyber attacks. These attacks can compromise communication links between sensors, actuators, and PLCs, as well as across PLCs and SCADA systems. Once a link is compromised, an attacker can send false state data to one or more PLCs or directly control an actuator. Unless the defense mechanism is robust, such attacks can lead to undesirable responses, system shutdowns, and device damage.

### 1.2 Problem Setting
We assume that the CPS under attack has multiple stages, each controlled by a PLC, and that PLCs can communicate over a network. Each stage contains sensors and actuators, referred to as entities. This architecture is common in water treatment plants and other Industrial Control Systems (ICS). We further assume that an attacker has access to any one stage of the CPS, allowing them to compromise one or more entities in that stage. A stage is considered compromised if all sensors and actuators are compromised; partial compromise occurs when only some entities are affected. Such attacks, known as single-stage multi-point (SSMP) attacks, are the focus of this work. The problem of attack detection can be stated as follows: What software mechanism can detect SSMP attacks on the CPS given that any one stage is partially or completely compromised?

## 2. Modeling a CPS
The first step in the proposed procedure is to construct a suitable model of a CPS. The general architecture and the modeling procedure are described below.

### 2.1 Structure of a CPS
CPS, such as power grids and water treatment systems, consist of a distributed supervisory control system. Each stage controls a specific portion of the CPS, and each stage is managed by a PLC. The PLC communicates with sensors and actuators via a local communication network (Level 0), and PLCs communicate with each other via a Level 1 network. The control actions are based on conditions evaluated using sensor data, which can involve simple or compound conditions.

### 2.2 Testbed Architecture
An operational water treatment plant, referred to as SWaT, was used for the experiments. SWaT produces 5 gallons/hr of filtered water and mimics a large modern water treatment plant. It consists of six stages, each controlled by dual PLCs (primary and backup). Detailed information about SWaT components, including sensors and actuators, can be found in [19].

#### 2.2.1 Communications
Each PLC obtains data from sensors and controls actuators in its domain. PLCs communicate with each other through a separate network, supporting both wired and wireless modes.

#### 2.2.2 Stages in SWaT
- **Stage P1:** Controls the inflow of water to the raw water tank.
- **Stage P2:** Manages the chemical dosing station.
- **Stage P3:** Handles the Ultrafiltration (UF) feed water tank.
- **Stage P4:** Manages the Reverse Osmosis (RO) feed water tank and dechlorination.
- **Stage P5:** Manages the RO filtration unit.
- **Stage P6:** Controls the cleaning of the UF unit.

#### 2.2.3 Sensors and Actuators
SWaT consists of 42 sensors and actuators distributed across the six stages, including level indicators, flow meters, pressure indicators, and chemical property sensors.

#### 2.2.4 Attack Points in SWaT
In this study, the wireless links between sensors and PLCs are considered attack points. All wireless links are assumed to be vulnerable to cyber attacks.

### 2.3 Sensor and Actuator Sets
The attack detection method uses state-based invariants. The variables used in the invariants are listed in Table 1. For example, \( v_2 \) denotes the state of sensor LIT101, which indicates the water level in tank T101. Similarly, \( v_4 \) indicates the state of pump P101.
