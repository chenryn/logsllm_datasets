In Table 1 and 2 we provide a comparison of our PLBE
scheme for the case of symmetric and asymmetric prime
order groups with that of [8] (which uses composite or-
der groups). The implementation was done on an Intel i3
2.9GHz quad core desktop PC with 2GB RAM. The groups
were chosen to guarantee 1024 bits of discrete log security
for encryption time and ciphertext size.
7.1 Encryption Time
The encryption time (Table 1, Figure 2) is heavily depen-
dent on a large number of exponentiation operations, one for
each row of ciphertext. It depends on the number of users
as O(√N ), explaining the parabolic nature of the graph(s).
The cost of exponentiation operations in elliptic curves de-
pend both on group representation size and the actual order
of the group. The order of symmetric groups that we have
chosen for this implementation are constructed to be of the
form 2a±2b±1, for some integers a, b. This makes exponen-
tiation in them very eﬃcient. The asymmetric order groups
are eﬃcient because of their smaller group size. The com-

phertext size (in bytes) for up to 5625 users. The security
guaranteed on the elliptic curves used are 1024 bit discrete
log security.

7.2 Ciphertext Size
The ciphertext size (Table 2, Figure 3) is dependent on
the representation size of the elliptic curve and the number
of group elements used. Our construction, although using a
larger number of group elements, has smaller total cipher-
text size (in the asymmetric case) because the group sizes
are signiﬁcantly smaller. The asymmetric groups, by their
nature allows us to optimize ciphertext size by increasing
the number of rows and decreasing the columns in (Fig. 1).
We call this the Skewed Asymmetric group version. Note
that by design, most of the group elements in the ciphertext
are placed in the smaller group G1. Skewing has no eﬀect
on security proofs and allows us to optimize on ciphertext
size.
Calculations show that using 25 × 16(= 400) rectangle
for generating ciphertexts produces only 15680 bytes which
gives us a 50% improvement compared to the scheme of [8]
We provide and implement eﬃcient broadcast, trace &
revoke system. Table 3 provides encryption times and ci-
7.3 Decryption Time
The decryption time for the various scenarios (Figure 4)
above are relatively constant and independent of the number
of users for each scheme. This is because decryption time is
dominated by the cost of pairing operations on the elliptic
curves. The composite order schemes decrypt at 0.296s per
ciphertext and the primer order symmetric and asymmet-
ric groups decrypt at 0.051s and 0.032s respectively. Thus
129we see the prime order groups are relative similar w.r.t de-
cryption times and are 10 times faster due to faster pairing
operations in these groups.
7.4 Comparison with the ElGamal Encryption
We compare the eﬃciency of our scheme with an imple-
mentation of a na¨ıve (but optimized) ElGamal based traitor
tracing scheme. The advantage of using an ElGamal based
scheme is that the group that it works on could support very
eﬃcient arithmentic operations (we choose the multiplica-
tive group Z ∗
p for a 1024 bit prime p) making encryption very
fast. The disadvantage is that for N users ElGamal based
systems use O(N ) steps whereas our scheme uses O(√N )
steps. We observe that the ElGamal implementation has a
huge ciphertext size overload compared to our scheme (Fig-
ure 5). We also observe that asymptotic improvements in
the encryption time begin to show up for as few as 2500
users (Figure 6).

8. CONCLUSION
Boneh et al. [8, 9] provide traitor tracing and trace & re-
voke systems using composite order bilinear groups. These
groups have large exponentiation and pairing times making
them impractical. We provide the ﬁrst implementation of a
traitor tracing and trace & revoke systems, using symmetric
and asymmetric prime order bilinear groups. Our imple-
mentation and comparisons with [8] show that we achieve
about 10 times faster decryption, 6 times faster encryption
and 50% reduction in ciphertext size. The ideas presented
in this work are general and can be applied to convert other
composite order cryptosystems to eﬃcient prime order based
cryptosystems.
