Results. We conducted 100 runs of our simulator for each
revocation checking strategy, during which each simulated user
visited 1,000 domains drawn from the Alexa Top-1M.10
We ﬁrst examine total network delay in Figure 7. We
observe that the browsers that check CRLs and OCSP accrue
an order of magnitude more delay than the CRLite user,
which makes sense given that each CRL/OCSP check involves
network requests. Although network requests have two orders
of magnitude more latency than CRLite (recall that each ﬁlter
check takes 24 hours ago). CRLite requires no work on the part
of CAs, no changes to certiﬁcates, no modiﬁcations to the TLS
protocol, and is suitable for resource-constrained clients.
We believe that CRLite shows that it is now worthwhile to
reinvestigate the trade-offs of complete and universal delivery
of revocation information. As a service to the community, we
make our code available at https://www.securepki.org.
