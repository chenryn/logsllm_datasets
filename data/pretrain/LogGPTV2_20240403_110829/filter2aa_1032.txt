#### Constitutional Foundations
- **1st Amendment:**
  - Protects the freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and the right to petition.
- **4th Amendment:**
  - Ensures the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. Warrants must be issued upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and must describe the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

#### Why Data Privacy Matters
- **Self-Censorship:** The fear of surveillance can lead to self-censorship, undermining free expression.
- **Third Party Doctrine:** A legal theory that holds that people who voluntarily give information to third parties (banks, phone companies, ISPs, email servers) have no reasonable expectation of privacy.
- **Outdated Laws:** The 1986 law removes warrant protections for emails over 180 days old.
- **Patriot Act:** Expanded government's ability to monitor, collect, and retain data, with delayed notification of searches.

#### NSA, Secret Courts, and Vehicle Tracking
- **NSA Mass Data Collection:** Involves major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, YouTube, Skype, and Apple.
- **Secret Courts (FISA):** From 1977 to 2013, the court rejected only 11 out of 33,900 requests.
- **DEA Program:** Collects license plate and facial recognition data, creating a national map of vehicle usage.

#### The "Nothing to Hide" Argument

- **Historical Examples:**
  - J. Edgar Hoover
