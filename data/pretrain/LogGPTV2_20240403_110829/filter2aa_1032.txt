• Why is this Important? Self Censorship!
Why Isn’t Our Data Ours?
• The Third Party Doctrine. 
• United States legal theory that holds that people who voluntarily give information 
to third parties—such as banks, phone companies, internet service providers (ISPs), 
and e-mail servers—have "no reasonable expectation of privacy.“ 
• Outdated laws from 1986 removes warrant protections to emails over 180 days old. 
• Patriot Act. 
• Expanded the Government’s ability to monitor, collect and retain the data of 
Americans and delay notification of these searches.

• Keep the Issue Non-Partisan.
Force Politicians to Listen
• Differences Between State and Federal.
• Constituents are only Represented when You Make Yourselves Heard.
• Make a Politician in a Tight Election Earn your Vote.

• Get Involved or Challenge Them for Office and Make it the Main Issue.
• CallThem Out Publicly.
• Facebook is Limited, Opinion Editorials in Papers is Powerful.
• Politicians Fear Controversy.
• Expecting Them to Know Better is Not Reasonable.
Have Your State Pass These Laws

Why You Matter
“When law and morality contradict each other, the citizen has the cruel 
alternative of either losing his moral sense or losing his respect for the law.”
― Frédéric Bastiat
