### SecDATAVIEW: A Secure Big Data Workflow Management System for Heterogeneous Computing Environments

#### Abstract
SecDATAVIEW is a secure big data workflow management system designed for heterogeneous computing environments. It leverages Intel SGX and AMD SEV to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data and code during execution. This paper details the system's architecture, remote attestation mechanisms, and performance evaluation.

#### 1. System Architecture

Every worker node in SecDATAVIEW is configured to execute the SGX-LKL library on Intel servers and SEV instances on AMD servers. During the worker node launch process, the Cloud Resource Management (CRM) subsystem verifies the trustworthiness of the nodes using remote attestation. For Intel SGX, an SGX-LKL-based remote attestation similar to [38] is used, while for AMD SEV, the AMD guest attestation [29] is employed. Note that at the time of writing, the Intel remote attestation feature was not fully integrated into the SGX-LKL release [54], and its implementation is left for future work. However, the WCPAC protocol assumes the integration of such a protocol, and both SGX and SEV worker nodes will use and pass the remote attestation upon CRM request.

The master node of SecDATAVIEW is deployed on a trusted on-premises server, ensuring its security. SecDATAVIEW dynamically provisions worker nodes from a given heterogeneous computing environment to execute specific workflows. The Code Provisioner and Task Executor are deployed on each worker node using the WCPAC protocol, while the remaining components run on the trusted on-premises server. Figure 3 illustrates the communication diagram of the WCPAC protocol, with a detailed sequence diagram provided in Appendix 7.

#### 2. Initialization and Execution Process

1. **Workflow Activation**:
   - The Workflow Executor activates the CRM module, specifying the machine type (SGX/SEV) to initialize the worker nodes (Step (a) in Figure 3).

2. **Worker Node Initialization**:
   - For SGX nodes, the CRM module sends the SGX-LKL disk image, activates SGX-LKL over SSH, and runs a standalone SFTP server inside an SGX-LKL enclave using Intel remote attestation.
   - For SEV nodes, the CRM module sends the SEV disk image, activates SEV over SSH, and runs a standalone SFTP server inside the SEV-protected VM using AMD guest attestation.
   - Upon successful initialization, all worker nodes have an active SFTP server (Step (b) in Figure 3).

3. **Code Provisioning and Attestation**:
   - The Workflow Executor activates the Code Provisioning Attestation (CPA) module, which computes the SHA256 digest of the Code Provisioner file and stores it in memory (Step (c) in Figure 3).
   - The CPA module generates an encryption key, encrypts the Task Executor, and sends the Code Provisioner, SSL certificates, and encrypted Task Executor to the worker node via SFTP (Step (d) in Figure 3).
   - The SFTP server dynamically activates the Code Provisioner through Java reflection and class loading, transfers control, and terminates the SFTP server.
   - The Code Provisioner computes its SHA256 digest, initiates a new SFTP server, opens an SSL socket to communicate with the CPA module, and sends its digest (Steps (e) and (f) in Figure 3).

4. **Attestation and Key Transfer**:
   - The CPA module compares the received digest with the stored one to ensure the Code Provisioner's integrity.
   - If the digest matches, the CPA module sends the Task Executor’s decryption key, encrypted workflow input data, configuration, and SSL certificate (Steps (g) and (h) in Figure 3).
   - The Code Provisioner decrypts the Task Executor, dynamically activates it, and transfers control (Step (i) in Figure 3).

5. **Task Execution**:
   - The Task Executor initializes and starts a new SSL socket with its SSL certificate.
   - Communication between the Workflow Executor and Task Executor is secured, and the Task Executor completes assigned tasks based on the local workflow schedule.
   - Output results are sent through SFTP to child worker nodes or back to the user in encrypted form (Steps (j) and (k) in Figure 3).

#### 3. Security Considerations
- The workflow’s data cryptography key is carried with the Task Executor and used for encryption and decryption throughout the workflow.
- The data owner generates and encrypts input files with a provided tool, and the secret key is securely transferred and decrypted in trustworthy worker nodes.
- All trustworthy worker nodes share the same cryptography key, allowing for seamless data decryption and encryption across the workflow.

##### 4.2 Workflow Performance Evaluation
We evaluated SecDATAVIEW using three types of workflows: Diagnosis Recommendation, Word Count (Map-Reduce), and Distributed K-means. We measured the performance overhead in terms of execution time and memory usage for eight different configurations:

- **SGX Inactive without Data Encryption**
- **SGX Inactive with Data Encryption**
- **SGX Active with Data Encryption**
- **SEV Inactive without Data Encryption**
- **SEV Inactive with Data Encryption**
- **SEV Active with Data Encryption**
- **Hybrid Inactive with Data Encryption**
- **Hybrid Active with Data Encryption**

All experiments were conducted with 2GB SGX heap, 4GB SEV RAM, and 1GB JVM heap memory space. The reported results include the aggregated performance and overhead incurred by SGX-LKL/SEV runtime, secure network stack, read/write access, file encryption/decryption, file transfer, and secure task execution.

##### 4.2.1 Diagnosis Recommendation Workflow
The diagnosis recommendation workflow uses machine learning methods and raw textual datasets for patient prescriptions. We created synthetic patient records ranging from 10,000 to 100,000, with an average length of 150 characters. The results show the overhead and performance impact of using SGX and SEV in this real-life scenario.

#### 5. Conclusion
SecDATAVIEW provides a robust and secure framework for executing big data workflows in heterogeneous computing environments. The system ensures data and code integrity through remote attestation and encryption, while maintaining acceptable performance overhead. Future work will focus on integrating advanced remote attestation features and optimizing performance further.
