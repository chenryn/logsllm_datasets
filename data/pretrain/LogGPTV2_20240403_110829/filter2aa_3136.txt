Concept Behind Hacker Spaces
(Sorry if you know this already)
• Definition (hackerfoundation.org):
– Any gathering of Hackers as a community to share
ideas, collaborate on projects or merely enjoy each
other's company could be considered a hacker space.
– 4 Types:
• Local Gatherings
• Conventions
• Hacker Group Living Situations
• Fixed Hacker Research Spaces
My mind – “Oooh!  I want one!”
Hacker Spaces
• A Few Hacker Spaces:
– CCC: Chaos Computer Club
• 2k+ members
– C-Base
• 300 members
– NYC Resistors
• 18 members
My Mind – “Larger than what I’m willing to
do”
Cost of a Hacker Space
• Cost:
– C-Base (300 members)
• July – Almost went bankrupt
• Received “20,000 of the needed 30,000 Euros needed in 6
weeks”1
– NYC Resistors (18 members)
• “can get a place near Lemur, looking at around $2,250”2
– Local Rent:  1250 sq.ft. @ $800/mo
My Mind – “Just too expensive”

are
–Wardriving, conventions, gatherings
• Mobile classroom
Mobile Hacker Spaces
• Advantages
–Cost is minimized
• Purchase price + gas + insurance
–Supports large range of people
• Small groups inside (max 8)
• Large groups outside (based on
hardware)
Mobile Hacker Spaces
• Advantages
–Modular
