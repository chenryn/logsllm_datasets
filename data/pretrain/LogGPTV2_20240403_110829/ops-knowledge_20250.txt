User: Please provide a general hardware troubleshooting checklist listing possible failures and workarounds.
Assistant: The common hardware troubleshooting list includes: 1. Power failure: The computer cannot be turned on or crashes suddenly, which may be caused by a power failure. At this time, it is necessary to check whether the power supply is connected firmly, whether the power is turned on, and whether the power supply is working normally. 2. Memory failure: If a blue screen or crash occurs when the computer is running, it may be caused by a memory failure. At this time, you need to check whether the memory is plugged in and whether the memory is working normally. 3. Hard disk failure: If there is a hard disk failure prompt when the computer is turned on, or the computer cannot be turned on, it may be caused by a hard disk failure. At this time, it is necessary to check whether the hard disk is connected firmly and whether the hard disk is physically damaged. 4. Graphics card failure: When the computer is running graphics applications, there may be picture faults or blurred screens, which may be caused by a graphics card failure. At this time, you need to check whether the graphics card is inserted properly and whether the graphics card is working normally. 5. CPU failure: If the computer freezes or freezes during operation, it may be caused by a CPU failure. At this time, it is necessary to check whether the CPU is plugged in and whether the CPU is working normally. For the above possible failures, the countermeasures include: 1. Power failure: replace or repair the power supply. 2. Memory failure: replace or repair the memory. 3. Hard disk failure: replace the hard disk or repair the hard disk. 4. Graphics card failure: replace or repair the graphics card. 5. CPU failure: replace the CPU or repair the CPU. In addition, you can also try to reinstall the operating system, update related drivers, and clean up the dust in the chassis to try to repair the hardware failure.
