# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Implement single-instance mode as an option, so that multiple executions of
`wt.exe` would add new tabs to already running instance of WT, instead of
opening new windows.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
When I run `wt.exe` multiple times, I get a new Windows Terminal window every
time. I do that quite often when navigating folders in Total Commander. I just
type `wt` and expect the new tab to be opened with the directory I'm currently
in in TC. Instead, I'd prefer to have a new tab in existing window.
Similarly, when running a shell (wsl.exe) inside Windows Terminal, if I type
`wt.exe` I'd expect another tab to be opened. Currently nothing happens in
this scenario (not even new WT window is opened).
I think, this could be managed with a single setting in `profile.json`:  
`"mode": "single-window|multiple-window"` or sth similar.
