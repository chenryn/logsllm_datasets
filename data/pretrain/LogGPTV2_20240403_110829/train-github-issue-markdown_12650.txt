# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement
Implement a single-instance mode as an option, so that multiple executions of `wt.exe` will add new tabs to an already running instance of Windows Terminal, instead of opening new windows.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
Currently, when I run `wt.exe` multiple times, a new Windows Terminal window is opened each time. This often occurs when I am navigating folders in Total Commander and type `wt` to open a new tab in the directory I am currently in. Instead of opening a new window, I would prefer for a new tab to be added to the existing instance of Windows Terminal.

Similarly, when running a shell (e.g., `wsl.exe`) inside Windows Terminal, typing `wt.exe` should open a new tab within the same window. Currently, nothing happens in this scenarioâ€”not even a new Windows Terminal window is opened.

This behavior could be managed with a setting in `profile.json`, such as:
```json
"mode": "single-window"  // or "multiple-window"
```

This setting would allow users to choose between opening new tabs in an existing instance or opening new windows.
