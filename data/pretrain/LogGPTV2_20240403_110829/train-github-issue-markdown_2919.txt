131 tests failed.  
However, most of them (all but two) failed with the following error:
    01:40:47   Expected error:
    01:40:47       : {
    01:40:47           s: "timed out waiting for the condition",
    01:40:47       }
    01:40:47       timed out waiting for the condition

which means that we couldn't create a namespace.
