### B. Simulation Methodology

In this section, we outline the key dimensions and parameters used in our simulation.

1. **Topology Type:**
   - We experiment with three types of BRITE [24] router-level topologies: Barabasi–Albert, Waxman, and hierarchical models.
   - Additionally, we use a real-world router topology with 284,805 nodes [9].

2. **Topology Size:**
   - The number of nodes in the simulated topologies ranges from 1,000 to 20,000.
   - This node count includes both internal nodes (routers) and end-hosts.

3. **Fraction of End-Hosts on the Overlay Network:**
   - End-hosts are defined as nodes with the least degree.
   - We randomly select 50 to 300 end-hosts to be part of the overlay network.
   - The graphs are pruned to remove nodes and links that are not referenced by any path on the overlay network.

4. **Link Loss Rate Distribution:**
   - 95% of the links are classified as "good," and the remaining 5% as "bad."
   - For directed graphs, bidirectional links between a pair of nodes are assigned separate loss rates.
   - Two different models are used for assigning loss rates:
     - **Model 1:** Good links have a loss rate uniformly distributed between 0% and 0.2%, while bad links have a loss rate between 5% and 10%.
     - **Model 2:** Good links have a loss rate between 0% and 0.2%, and bad links have a loss rate between 0.2% and 100%.
   - Most results discussed in this paper are based on Model 1, except for Section VI-C4.

5. **Loss Model:**
   - After assigning each directional link a loss rate, we use either a Bernoulli or Gilbert model to simulate the loss processes, as in [5] and [8].
   - The Gilbert model is more likely to generate bursty losses compared to the Bernoulli model.
   - State transition probabilities are selected such that the average loss rate matches the assigned loss rate.
   - Results from both models are similar, but the Gilbert model, being more realistic, is used for all presented results.

**Simulation Setup:**
- Each simulation configuration is repeated five times, with a new topology and new loss rate assignments in each repetition.
- Path loss rates are simulated based on the transmission of 10,000 packets.
- Using the loss rates of selected paths as input, we compute the loss rates of all the Minimal Identifiable Link Sets (MILSs).

### C. Simulation Results

In this section, we present the results of our simulations.

1. **Accuracy of MILSs:**
   - For all three types of synthetic topologies, our system achieved highly accurate estimates of the MILS loss rates.
   - We focus on the accuracy of loss rate estimates for MILSs on lossy paths, which is even better when considering all paths.
   - Figure 9 shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of absolute errors and error factors under the Gilbert model for various topologies.
   - The errors arise from measurement noise and the approximation of the good path algorithm, but they do not accumulate significantly in our system.
   - For all configurations, 90% of the absolute errors are less than 0.006, and 90% of the error factors are less than 1.6.

2. **Granularity of MILSs:**
   - Table II presents the granularity of MILSs and related statistics under hierarchical BRITE topologies and the real-world Mercator topology.
   - We prune the topology to include only the links on the paths among the randomly selected end-hosts, merge links without branching points into one virtual link, and select a basis set for monitoring.
   - The number of lossy paths and the number of links in these paths are given in Table II.
   - The MILS identification and loss rate calculation are based on virtual links to reduce computational cost.
   - The average length of MILSs is quite small, less than two virtual links and less than three physical links.
   - The diagnosis granularity is generally less than two virtual links, which is close to the diagnosis upper bound of pure end-to-end approaches.

3. **Influencing Factors of the MILS Granularity:**
   - We study two factors that influence MILS length: the size of the overlay network and the loss rate distributions of links.
   - Figure 10 (top) shows the length of MILSs with different sizes of overlay networks under the Mercator topology and loss rate distribution.
   - When the overlay network size is very small (less than 50), there is little path sharing, leading to longer MILSs. As the number of hosts and paths increases, path sharing becomes significant, and MILSs become shorter.
   - Figure 10 (bottom) shows the lengths of MILSs for an overlay of 100 end-hosts under the Mercator topology with different percentages of lossy links. The lengths of MILSs grow almost linearly with the percentage of lossy links.

4. **Results for Different Link Loss Rate Distributions and Running Time:**
   - Simulations were run with both loss rate distribution models. The results are similar, except that with larger loss rates and the same percentage of lossy links, the length of MILSs on lossy paths increases slightly.
   - Table III shows the lossy path inference with the Barabasi–Albert topology model and the Gilbert loss model.
   - The running times for both models are similar, as shown in Table III. All speed results are based on a 3.2-GHz Pentium 4 machine with 2 GB memory.
   - Setup time for an overlay of 300 end-hosts is about 45 minutes, but it takes less than 1 minute for an overlay of 100 end-hosts.
   - Continuous monitoring, inference, and diagnosis are very fast, even for large overlays with 300 end-hosts, 89,700 paths, and more than 20,000 links, diagnosing all trouble spots within 1 minute.

5. **Results for Dynamic Changes:**
   - Our system must handle dynamic updates due to route changes and end-hosts joining or leaving the overlay network.
   - Two common scenarios are adding a new host to the overlay and changing routing.
   - Adding Nodes: Starting with an overlay network of 90 random end-hosts, we add one end-host at a time until the overlay size reaches 100. The average running time for adding a node is 0.21 seconds.
   - Routing Changes: Removing one link used by the overlay and recomputing the routes takes about 1.2 seconds on average, comparable to the time to recompute all matrices from scratch (about 2.3 seconds).

6. **Comparison with Gibbs Sampling:**
   - We implemented the Gibbs sampling algorithm, which was shown to be the most accurate approach in [5].
   - Figure 11 shows the absolute and relative errors of the inference of virtual links or MILSs using the real Mercator topology with the Gilbert loss model and loss rate distribution.
   - The accuracy of MILSs is much better than that of Gibbs sampling on virtual links, with fewer false positives and negatives.
   - Gibbs sampling based on MILSs is more accurate than that based on end-to-end paths, likely due to finer granularity and reduced interaction between identified MILSs.
   - Running speed: Gibbs sampling based on the whole paths takes about five times longer than Gibbs sampling based on the MILS set.

### VII. Internet Experiments

Shortest path routing is often violated in the Internet, a phenomenon known as path inflation [25]. To evaluate our LEND system, we deployed it on the PlanetLab [26] and discuss the results below.

#### A. Methodology

- **Deployment:**
  - We deployed our monitoring system on 135 PlanetLab hosts around the world (see Table IV).
  - About 60% of the hosts are in the US, with the rest located mostly in Europe and Asia.
  - There are a total of 9,045 end-to-end paths among these end-hosts.

- **Measurement:**
  - We measured the topology among these sites by simultaneously running "traceroute" to find the paths from each host to all others.
  - Each host saves its destination IP addresses for sending measurement packets later.
  - We measured the loss rates between each pair of hosts, consisting of 300 trials, each lasting 300 ms.
  - During each trial, each host sends a 40-byte UDP packet to every other host, containing 20-byte IP header, 8-byte UDP header, and 12-byte data on sequence number and sending time.
  - The receiver counts the number of packets received out of 300 to calculate the overall loss rate.
  - Parameters were chosen using a sensitivity test to prevent additional congestion.

- **Prevention of Congestion:**
  - To prevent any host from receiving too many packets simultaneously, each host sends packets to other hosts in a different random order.
  - Each host uses a different permutation in each trial to ensure equal opportunity for each destination.
  - A well-connected server broadcasts a "START" command to ensure all hosts take measurements at the same time.

#### B. Experiment Results

- **Granularity of MILSs and Diagnosis:**
  - Of the 9,045 end-to-end paths, 65.5% were good paths, containing about 70.5% of the links.
  - After removing good paths, only 6,450 paths remained.
  - The average length of lossy MILSs on these bad paths is 3.9 links or 2.3 virtual links (see Table V).
  - The diagnosis granularity of lossy paths is 3.8, which is reasonable and acceptable for practical purposes.
