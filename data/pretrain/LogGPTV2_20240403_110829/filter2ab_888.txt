**ATT&CK ID:** G0032  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Lazarus Group

The Lazarus Group has been known to restore malicious code in the `KernelCallbackTable` to its original state after hijacking the process execution flow.[11] 

This technique allows the group to maintain persistence and evade detection by returning the system to a seemingly normal state, while still retaining control.
