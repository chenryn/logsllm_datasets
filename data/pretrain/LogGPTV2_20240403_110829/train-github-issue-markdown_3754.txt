Hi,
Is it possible to add i18n routing feature directly in symfony stack framework
?
i18n routing example :  
3 i18n routes for the same controller action :
  * /fr/contact/
  * /en/contact/
  * /de/kontakt/
As Symfony have Router and Translater component, It would be logic that these
2 components works together to provide i18n routing capability.  
A few extra bundles provide this feature (like JMSI18nRoutingBundle), but in
my opinion this need is very common and could be candidate to the symfony
core.
What do you think about that ?
Regards,  
David.
