User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to boot other Remote Desktop users We use Windows "Remote Desktop" to log into server machines. At the moment, I am getting the following error message:

The terminal server has exceeded the maximum number of allowed connections.


Now, the cause is obvious (2 other people are logged on right now!). I recall that in the past I solved this by logging on to some other machine in the same domain and then going to some admin tool which I cannot recall. From there I could see who was logged in and remotely terminate their session (assuming I had sufficient privileges) -- thereby freeing up one of the connections.

Does anyone know how to do this?

Assistant: You can use Terminal Services Manager under Administrative Tools.

If you prefer a command-line solution, you can use this to list RDP sessions:

query session /server:servername


To reset a session, look for the relevant session ID in the "ID" column of the output from the above command, then use:

reset session &lt;sessionid&gt; /server:servername
