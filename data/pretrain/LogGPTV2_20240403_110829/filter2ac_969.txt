**Title: Black Hat US-20: Security Research on Mercedes-Benz - From Hardware to Car Control**

In recent years, the integration of intelligent features into modern vehicles has expanded significantly, introducing a broader range of potential attack surfaces. As a car security research team, we are deeply interested in understanding the design and development of luxury vehicles. This led us to initiate a comprehensive study on Mercedes-Benz in 2018.

In this presentation, we will delve into the methodologies and findings from our security research on connected cars, with a specific focus on Mercedes-Benz. Our discussion will cover the following key areas:

1. **Building a Cost-Effective Testbench:**
   We will share our approach to constructing a test environment that includes relevant intelligent components at a minimal cost. This setup allows us to conduct thorough and realistic security tests.

2. **Designing an Attack Chain:**
   Based on our testbench, we will outline the steps involved in creating an attack chain that targets the vehicle's internal systems from an external entry point. This will provide insights into the vulnerabilities present in the car's architecture.

3. **Executing the Attack in a Genuine Vehicle:**
   We will demonstrate how we successfully executed the designed attack chain on a real Mercedes-Benz E-Class car. This practical application revealed several critical vulnerabilities.

Our research uncovered vulnerabilities that, when exploited, allowed us to remotely unlock the doors and start the engine of the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. These vulnerabilities have the potential to affect all connected Mercedes-Benz vehicles in China, estimated to be over 2 million units.

This talk aims to highlight the importance of robust security measures in the automotive industry and to share our findings to help improve the overall security of connected vehicles.
