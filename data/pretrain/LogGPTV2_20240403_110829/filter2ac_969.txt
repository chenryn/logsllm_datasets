title:blackhat:us-20 Security Research on Mercedes-Benz: From Hardware to Car Control
Nowadays, more and more intelligent functionalities have been introduced to modern cars, which also brings more attack surfaces to the cars. As a car security research team, we like to learn more about the luxury cars' design and development, so we initiated the research on Mercedes-Benz in 2018.In this talk, we will discuss how to perform security research on Connected Cars. First of all, we will talk about how to build a testbench with relevant intelligent components at a low cost. Secondly, we design an attack chain from the outside to the inside of the vehicle based on this testbench. Thirdly, we perform the attack chain in a genuine car. This talk will explain how we researched a Mercedes-Benz E-Class car and found the vulnerabilities. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, we can remotely unlock the door and start the engine and they potentially impact all Mercedes-Benz connected cars in China (estimated over 2 million).
