### Introduction

Predicting resource usage for a large number of time series from co-located virtual machines (VMs) in production data centers presents several challenges, including accuracy, training overhead, and model scalability. Traditional temporal models, such as ARIMA, often struggle to capture bursty behaviors effectively. More sophisticated models like neural networks can better capture irregular patterns but at the cost of higher computational overhead. Therefore, it is essential to develop efficient and accurate prediction models that scale well.

### Proposed Methodology

We propose a novel prediction methodology that combines both temporal and spatial models to predict resource demand time series \( D_i \) (\( \forall i \in [1, M \times N] \)), where \( M \) is the number of co-located VMs and \( N \) is the number of different resources considered. The demand series is defined as the product of the usage series and the allocated virtual capacity. Both demand and usage series share similar correlation characteristics. For the purpose of virtual resource resizing, we directly predict the demand series.

#### Signature Series and Dependent Series

We introduce the concept of **signature series**: a minimal set of time series predicted using temporal models. The remaining demand series, termed **dependent series**, are predicted through a linear combination of the signature series using spatial models. We divide the demand series \( D_i \) into two sets: the **signature set** \( \Omega_s \) and the **dependent set** \( \Omega_d \).

The novelty of our approach, called **ATM (Adaptive Temporal Modeling)**, lies in deriving novel spatial models for dependent series while applying existing temporal models to predict the signature series. Various techniques exist in the literature for reducing the overhead of temporal models by extracting and storing features of the time series. Any temporal prediction model can be integrated into the ATM framework.

### Spatial Models

To derive the spatial models, we express each dependent series \( D_k \) (\( k \in \Omega_d \)) as a linear combination \( f_k \) of the signature series \( D_j \) (\( j \in \Omega_s \)):
\[ D_k = f_k(D_j). \]

A brute-force solution to find the minimum signature set would involve exploring all \( 2^{N \times M} \) combinations of regression models, which is computationally infeasible for typical values of \( M \) (around 10 or more). To address this, we devise an efficient searching algorithm that leverages time series clustering techniques and stepwise regression.

### Searching for Signature Demand Series

#### Key Steps

1. **Time Series Clustering**:
   - **Step 1**: Define the initial set of signature series using time series clustering, specifically dynamic time warping (DTW) or correlation-based clustering (CBC).
   - **Step 2**: Refine the final set of signature series by detecting and removing multicollinearity among the initial set using variance inflation factors (VIF) and stepwise regression.

#### Time Series Clustering

**Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**:
- DTW is effective for finding clusters of time series with short distances. However, it may not capture series with larger distances within the same cluster.
- We compute the distance dissimilarity between two series \( P = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\} \) and \( Q = \{q_1, q_2, ..., q_m\} \) using the recursive formula:
  \[ \lambda(i, j) = d(p_i, q_j) + \min\{\lambda(i-1, j-1), \lambda(i-1, j), \lambda(i, j-1)\}, \]
  where \( d(p_i, q_j) = (p_i - q_j)^2 \).
- Hierarchical clustering is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters based on the average silhouette value. The series with the lowest average dissimilarity in each cluster is identified as the signature series.

**Correlation-Based Clustering (CBC)**:
- CBC groups series showing high correlation. For each box, we compute the pairwise correlation coefficients \( \rho \) for all pairs of the \( M \times N \) series.
- We rank each series by the total number of correlations above a threshold \( \rho_{\text{Th}} \) (set to 0.7) and the mean value of these correlations.
- The top-ranked series and its highly correlated series form a new cluster, with the top-ranked series being the signature series. This process continues until the ranked list is empty.

#### Stepwise Regression

- To further reduce the number of signature series, we calculate the VIF for each series in the signature set. A VIF greater than 4 indicates multicollinearity.
- Standard stepwise regression is performed to remove series that can be represented as linear combinations of other signature series.

### Prediction Models

To predict all \( M \times N \) demand series:
1. **Signature Series Prediction**: Use neural network models and historical data to predict the signature series \( D_i \) (\( i \in \Omega_s \)).
2. **Dependent Series Prediction**: Regress each dependent series on the set of signature series, obtaining coefficients using ordinary least squares estimates.

The ATM framework is flexible, allowing any suitable temporal prediction model to be easily integrated.

### Results on Spatial Models

We evaluate the proposed spatial models using trace data from 6,000 boxes and 80,000 VMs. Our evaluation focuses on:
1. **Comparison of DTW and CBC Clustering**.
2. **Effectiveness of Clustering and Stepwise Regression**.
3. **Inter- vs. Intra-Resource Models**.

#### Comparison of DTW and CBC

- **Number of Clusters**: DTW results in fewer clusters (about 70% of boxes have 2-3 clusters), while CBC results in more clusters, leading to a higher number of signature series.
- **Signature Series Types**: Under DTW, CPU and RAM series are equally represented, whereas under CBC, most signature series are CPU series.

#### Effectiveness of the Two-Step Approach

- **Signature Set Reduction**: DTW reduces the set to 26%, with little further reduction after stepwise regression. CBC reduces the set to 82%, which is further reduced to 66% by stepwise regression.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: DTW has an average absolute percentage error (APE) of about 28%, while CBC has an APE of around 20%. Stepwise regression does not significantly affect the prediction accuracy for either method.

### Conclusion

Our proposed ATM framework effectively combines temporal and spatial models to predict resource demand time series. By leveraging efficient clustering and stepwise regression, we achieve significant reductions in the number of signature series without degrading prediction accuracy. This approach is scalable and adaptable to various temporal prediction models.
