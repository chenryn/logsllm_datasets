Vulnerability scanning: Use automated tools such as Nessus and other vulnerability scanners to scan systems and applications to discover existing vulnerabilities and security risks. 2. Penetration testing: By simulating hacker attacks, testing the security of systems and applications to discover possible vulnerabilities and risks. 3. Security configuration audit: review system and application settings, confirm compliance with security best practices, and discover and fix potential security vulnerabilities in a timely manner. 4. Network traffic analysis: analyze network traffic, find unusual activities or abnormal traffic, and identify possible attacks and vulnerabilities. 5. Social engineering assessment: Test the security awareness of organizations through deception to discover whether they are vulnerable to social engineering attacks. Commonly used network security assessment tools include: Nessus, Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, Burp Suite, etc. At the same time, some service providers and institutions provide paid network security assessment services to assist organizations in discovering risks and provide countermeasure suggestions.
