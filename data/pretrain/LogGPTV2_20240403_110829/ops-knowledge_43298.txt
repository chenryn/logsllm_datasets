To effectively implement CIS Control 3.4, "Enforce Data Retention," an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Develop a Data Retention Policy**: Establish a clear and comprehensive data retention policy that aligns with legal, regulatory, and business requirements. This policy should define the types of data to be retained, the duration for which they must be kept, and the criteria for their eventual disposal.

2. **Set Minimum and Maximum Retention Periods**: Ensure that the data retention policy specifies both minimum and maximum retention periods. The minimum period ensures that data is available for the required duration, while the maximum period helps in timely and secure disposal, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

3. **Integrate with Data Management Processes**: Integrate the data retention policy into the organization's broader data management processes. This includes ensuring that data is properly classified, stored, and managed throughout its lifecycle.

4. **Implement Automated Controls**: Use automated tools and systems to enforce data retention policies. This can include setting up automatic deletion or archiving of data once it reaches the end of its retention period, as well as regular audits to ensure compliance.

5. **Monitor and Audit Compliance**: Regularly monitor and audit the implementation of the data retention policy to ensure ongoing compliance. This includes reviewing access controls, verifying that data is being retained and disposed of according to the policy, and addressing any discrepancies or issues that arise.

6. **Train Employees**: Provide training and awareness programs for employees to ensure they understand the importance of data retention and their roles in maintaining compliance with the policy.

CIS Control 3.4, "Enforce Data Retention," focuses on the asset type "Data" and falls under the security function "Protect." By following these procedures, organizations can enhance their data protection measures and reduce the risk of data-related incidents.
