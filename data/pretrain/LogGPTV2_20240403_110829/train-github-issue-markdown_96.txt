### Version 2.6.7 on my computer, not sure about the version used in jsfiddle
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/cicsolutions/qkzjp520/6/
### Steps to reproduce
Create three named slots: (1) with no dash in the slot name, like 'header' or
'footer', as in the docs. (2) with a dash in the name, like 'card-header' and
(3) with a camelCased slot name.
Console log the slot contents at the created and mounted hooks (other
lifecycle hooks not tested) of the component.
### What is expected?
I would expect the slot contents for all slot name syntaxes to be available at
in the lifecycle hooks and rendered in component. (unsure if hyphenated or
camelCasing is preferred for compound names)
I would 100% expect that if the contents of the slot can be logged to the
console during created/mounted hooks, that it could be rendered via the render
function (which appears to not be true for camelCased slot names)
### What is actually happening?
The slot content for a slot where the name contains a dash is undefined at the
created hook, whereas the slot content where the name does not have a dash is
defined as expected with the slot node object.
Most strange ... content for the slot with a camelCased name is logged to the
console properly, but not rendered in the component.

Please let me know if this type of report is unhelpful. I really don't have
the time to first search the forums and such, and I'm still learning Vue, so
I'm unsure if for some reason this would be intended behavior.
I do not see anything in the docs that gives notes about the syntax for the
slot names that may be compound phrases/names. However I thought I read
somewhere in the docs that camelCase is not valid HTML, so i first figured the
hyphenated version of the slot name would be correct.
It does make sense to me that the value that follows the colon in the
directive declaration becomes the $slots object key, and the value is not
rendered as a DOM element attribute, so I thought perhaps using camelCase is
the proper way to have compound slot names. But when using camelCase slot
names, the slot content does appear in the console, but is not rendered via
the render function. So ... that's even stranger!?
It would be great if the docs could touch on the proper naming convention for
slot names, as compound slot names seem like they would be a pretty common
approach to slot naming.
Note: I did not test other lifecycle hooks.
Perhaps I'm not understanding slots properly, but it seems strange to me that
a slot named with a dash will render properly but show as undefined for in the
created/mounted hooks. And the opposite: having a camelCase slot name does
show a correct node value in the hooks, however does not actually render the
slotted content.
Hope this helps! Thanks so much for all you do! Vue is simply the best
framework I've ever used!
