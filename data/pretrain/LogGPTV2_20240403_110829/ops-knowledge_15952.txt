User: Is there any chance to create a outlook .msg file without having outlook installed.
We use a django backend and need to create a msg file containing a task for importing in outlook. Since we use unix-based servers we dont have any chance to get outlook installed (except wine etc..)  
Is there a component to generate such .msg files in any programming language without having outlook installed?
Assistant: Why not create an EML file? It is MIME, so there are hundreds of libraries out there. Outlook will be able to open an EML file just fine.
In your particular case, create a MIME file with the vTodo MIME part as the primary MIME part.
