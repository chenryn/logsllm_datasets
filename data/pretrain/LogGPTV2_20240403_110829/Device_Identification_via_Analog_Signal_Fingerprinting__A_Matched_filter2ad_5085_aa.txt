Abstract
As part of
the Detecting Intrusions at Layer ONe
(DILON) project, we show that Ethernet devices can be
uniquely identiﬁed and tracked—using as few as 25 Ether-
net frames—by analyzing variations in their analog signal
caused by hardware and manufacturing inconsistencies. An
optimal detector, the matched ﬁlter, is utilized to create sig-
nal proﬁles, which aid in identifying the device the signal
originated from. Several non-traditional applications of the
ﬁlter are presented in order to improve its ability to dis-
criminate between signals from seemingly identical devices
of the same manufacturing lot. The experimental results of
applying these ﬁlters to three different models of Ethernet
cards, totaling 16 devices, are presented and discussed.
Important applications of this technology include intru-
sion detection (discovering node impersonation and net-
work tampering), authentication (preventing unauthorized
access to the physical network), forensic data collection (ty-
ing a physical device to a speciﬁc network incident), and
assurance monitoring (determining whether a device will
or is in the process of failing).
1. Introduction
1.1. Network access control
Current network access control (NAC) mechanisms rely
exclusively on the use of digital tokens or identiﬁers—
usernames and passwords, MAC addresses, SSL certiﬁ-
cates, WEP/WPA keys, etc—to prevent unauthorized ac-
cess. Unfortunately, even strong tokens and identiﬁers, such
as SSL certiﬁcates, by their purely digital nature, can be dis-
cretely copied if improperly secured, and put to use by ma-
licious users. Even worse, popular weak identiﬁers, such
as MAC addresses, may be easily obtained through pas-
sive network monitoring, and spoofed through the use of
a programmable network card. In contrast, the analog char-
acteristics of a device are nearly impossible to obtain (a
measurement cannot be done without physical access to the
medium) and duplicate, which makes them well-suited for
NAC purposes.
In the digital age, the physical layer is often regarded as
a security impediment, or, at best, overlooked as a source
of solutions for today’s security needs, because of its non-
digital nature. The instinctive reaction to the physical layer
has been to focus on securing the layers above it, through
the use of encryption, so that some level of authentication
is necessary for access to it. These methods often prove in-
trusive to the end-user; forcing them to remember forever-
changing and arcane keys, conﬁgure troublesome access
clients, or keep track of yet another access token. Clearly,
a non-intrusive method, which compliments existing access
control methods, is needed to control access to the network
infrastructure. We believe that DILON technology can ful-
ﬁll this need.
1.2. The DILON concept
The DILON project investigates the use of analog and
digital characteristics of digital devices for such secu-
rity purposes as intrusion detection, authentication, foren-
sic data collection, and assurance monitoring. DILON is
founded upon the belief that hardware and manufactur-
ing inconsistencies cause minute and unique variations in
the signaling behavior of every digital device; furthermore,
these variations are manifest by use of the appropriate sig-
nal processing technique(s). Central to the security of this
concept is the belief that these slight variations are difﬁcult,
if not impossible, to control and duplicate. This assumption
is founded upon knowledge of the variable tolerances of de-
vice components, which are introduced in the design and
fabrication processes, used in the construction of digital de-
vices. These tolerances allow for unpredictable variations
in the overall electrical operation of the device. Simply put,
because of these variations, no two devices may be made
exactly the same, and hence their analog signal characteris-
tics cannot be made the same, without substantial reverse-
engineering beyond the reach of all but the most determined
attackers.
Figure 1 presents a system-level diagram for an imple-
mentation of DILON technology. On the top of the dia-
gram are subject devices that communicate over a physical
medium—wired or unwired—to connect with a controlled
device, a switch or access point for instance. At the control
device an analog tap is used in conjunction with an analog-
to-digital converter (ADC) to sample the electrical signals
arriving across the medium, at a much higher rate and with
greater resolution than is necessary to actually decode the
signal. Storage will also be required for past and present
ﬁngerprints. A policy engine will make use of a compari-
son module to determine which devices have access to the
network, as well as issue reports concerning the state of the
network.
The present approach for DILON focuses on making
use of a matched ﬁlter to create proﬁles of signals that are
useful in identifying the device the signal originated from.
We have found that a traditional matched ﬁlter is sensitive
enough to easily discriminate between signals produced by
different model Ethernet cards. Using advanced techniques,
a matched ﬁlter, applied in non-traditional ways, can be
made to discriminate between Ethernet cards of the same
model—even when each component of these cards pos-
sesses the same serial numbers, and appear to come from the
same manufacturing lot. We have also developed adaptive
methods that accurately track ﬂuctuations in signals due to
device aging, voltage variations, and temperature changes.
These methods provide realistic and consistent false-accept
and false-reject rates (FAR and FRR).
1.3. Previous work
Signal detection and identiﬁcation was one of the ma-
jor challenges in the research and development of radar and
wireless communication systems for a greater part of the
20th century. In particular, identiﬁcation of radar, radios,
and various wireless communications became a very impor-
tant and popular topic around the time of World War II [13].
Most methods developed for radar identiﬁcation at this time
were based upon transient analysis. As higher frequency
and faster responding circuits were introduced, more in-
depth transient analysis became necessary for transmitter
identiﬁcation. To this day, many researchers are making use
of transient methods for the identiﬁcation of modern trans-
mitters [3, 25, 1, 9, 10, 4, 17, 5]. However, these methods
have only proven successful in situations when the trans-
mitters under consideration were considerably different.
To date, a robust, reliable, and adoptable system for
transmitter characterization has yet to be devised to effec-
tively handle multiple transmitters in interconnected sys-
tems. While frequency based classiﬁcation models have
been suggested [11, 12, 15, 14, 20], and other general rules
for identiﬁcation have been suggested [6, 24], each is lim-
ited to discriminating between different brands and systems.
As traditional methods cannot adequately identify similar
devices, they will not be able to guarantee the privacy, secu-
rity, and integrity of sensitive information necessary to med-
ical, legal, governmental, and security management ﬁrms.
It should be noted that a similar problem was addressed
by cellular phone companies to combat cloning [23, 19, 18].
However, due to propriety nature of their work, there is very
little published on their methodology. From what can be
determined from the limited literature available, these meth-
ods do not have a high success rate in discriminating signals
from similar sources.
Recently, work in the development of physical authenti-
cation schemes has led to the creation of a physical token
that implements a physical one-way function, which is ver-
iﬁed using a statistical hashing algorithm [22]. Our work is
different from [22] in that we rely on the inherent physical
variation introduced as part of the manufacturing process,
and do not require extra variation to be explicitly added to
the devices for such purposes.
A more closely related physical authentication system
was introduced in [8, 7]. Gassend et. al investigated the
identiﬁcation of integrated circuits based upon the indirect
measurement of their timing characteristics. In contrast, our
method focuses on examining the spectral characteristics
across the operating bandwidth of the device. Additionally,
our work shows that the signaling characteristics of network
devices appear to be more amenable to identiﬁcation than
integrated circuits, as we have been able to identify a greater
number of devices.
Finally, recent work has investigated the possibility of
remotely ﬁngerprinting devices over the Internet by mea-
suring their clock skew [16]. This method shows promise;
however, accurate identiﬁcation seems to require 36 hours
of observation, where packets are received from the remote
host at a rate of 46 packets per hour. The efﬁcacy of this
method is difﬁcult to measure, as the authors do not report
their results in terms of false-reject and false-accept rates.
2. Background
The concepts of systems, signals, ﬁltering, and related
terminology and tools are discussed. The matched ﬁlter op-
eration is deﬁned.

2.1. Signals and systems
A system is a process by which an input signal is trans-
formed to produce an output signal; furthermore, a system
is said to be linear time-invariant (LTI) if the system is both
additive and multiplicative, and a time shift of the input re-
sults in a corresponding time shift in the output. It can be
shown that the response, or output, of an LTI system to all
inputs can be completely described by determining the sys-
tems unit impulse response [21]. For our purposes, the unit
impulse response, or transfer function, of a system in the
time domain will be denoted by h(t). The response of a sys-
tem, y(t), to a particular input, x(t), can be found by con-
volving the transfer function of the system with the input
signal. The convolution operation, denoted by ?, between
h(t) and x(t) is deﬁned as:
+∞Z
y(t) = h(t) ? x(t) =
h(t − τ)x(τ)dτ
(1)
−∞
By taking the Fourier Transform of the input signal, de-
noted by F{x(t)} = X(ω), and the transfer function, de-
noted by F{h(t)} = H(ω), the convolution operation de-
ﬁned in (1) may be replaced by multiplication:
Y (ω) = H(ω)X(ω)
(2)
It should be noted that (2) gives the frequency response
of a system, whereas (1) gives its time-domain response.
Of course, these responses are related through the inverse-
Fourier and Fourier Transforms, respectively.
2.2. Filters
A ﬁlter may be regarded as a special kind of system,
where the relative amplitudes and phases of the frequency
components of an input signal are modiﬁed, or eliminated.
As the ﬁlter discussed in this paper is LTI, we may describe
its response via a transfer function.
In turn, this transfer
function may be used in conjunction with either (1 or 2) to
determine the response of the ﬁlter to an input signal.
2.3. The matched ﬁlter
The matched ﬁlter is said to be an optimal detector, as it
can be shown that the ﬁlter maximizes the signal-to-noise
ratio of a known input signal in additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN). [2]. The transfer function of the matched
ﬁlter, in the frequency domain, at sampling time t0 may be
stated as:
A∗(ω)
P (ω)
exp−jωt0
H(ω) = κ
(3)
where A∗(ω) is the complex conjugate of the Fourier Trans-
form of a known time-domain signal α(t), P (ω) is the
power spectral density (PSD) of the noise associated with
an input signal, and κ is an arbitrary constant. By select-
ing an appropriate value of κ for the operating environment,
and assuming AWGN for the PSD, P (ω) may be eliminated
from (3). For a given input signal, β(t), the output of the
ﬁlter, Mt0, at sampling time t0, in the Gaussian noise case
is then:
Mt0 = H(ω)B(ω) = A∗(ω) exp−jωt0 B(ω)
(4)
where B(ω) is the Fourier Transform of the time-domain
input signal β(t).
Taking the inverse Fourier Transform of (3) gives the
transfer function of the ﬁlter, h(t), in the time-domain, for
the AWGN case, as:
h(t) = α(t0 − t)
(5)
It can be shown that the output of the ﬁlter is maximized
when:
t0Z
α(τ)β(τ)dτ
(6)
µ(t0) = h(t0) ? β(t0) =
t0−T
where T is the period of the known time-domain signal
α(t).
As can be seen from (6), the matched ﬁlter operation
may be interpreted as the inner-product of two signals, or
an integrated-correlation.
3. Signal identiﬁcation
We describe how the matched ﬁlter may be used to create
a signal proﬁle useful for identifying a signal’s device of
origin.
3.1. Signal selection rationale
This work focuses on the proﬁling of 10Mb wired Eth-
ernet signals. We chose to study 10Mb Ethernet because of
the relative simplicity of the electronic devices and signal-
ing involved, and its operation at low speeds. As the elec-
tronics and signaling are less complicated than higher-speed
systems, we were able to understand the functioning of the
devices, and identify common behavior between devices of
different makes, which aided us in hypothesis creation and
testing while attempting to identify differences and similar-
ities in signals. In addition, capturing accurate samples of
10Mb Ethernet frames may be accomplished using lower
resolution, slower, and therefore less expensive ADCs.
Wired Ethernet was chosen due to the low noise environ-
ment inherent in wired systems. Environmental noise adds
a stochastic and non-stationary component to the signal that
must be minimized as much as possible to obtain consis-
tent measurements. On the other hand, noise characteristics
of an individual device, or component from a device, may
exhibit distinguishing characteristics.
Finally, we believed that if we should fail in discriminat-
ing 10Mb Ethernet signals, we would have little chance of
succeeding in the high-speed wired and wireless domains.
However, we should also note that in some respects proﬁl-
ing 10Mb Ethernet signals may be viewed as a more difﬁ-
cult problem than that of higher-speed systems: there are
fewer components per device, and hence less opportunity
for signal variability due to perturbation by device compo-
nents.
3.2. Identifying a common signal
In order to create a proﬁle of the signal characteristics
for an Ethernet device, a portion of the frame preamble
common to all devices was identiﬁed. At the beginning of
each frame a 64-bit sequence of alternating ones and ze-
ros, encoded using differential Manchester encoding with a
fundamental frequency of 5MHz, ending with the sequence
10101011 are sent to synchronize the receiver of the desti-
nation device to the transmitter of the source device (Figure
2).
This synchronization signal consists of a transient, or
turn-on, portion (denoted by ’- . - . -’ in Figure 2), which
is the result of the transmitting circuitry of the sending de-
vice powering on, as well as a steady state portion (denoted
by ’- - - - -’ in Figure 2) that serves as the actual synchro-
nization signal.
As mentioned earlier, most work in signal identiﬁcation
has traditionally focused on the transient portion of a sig-
nal. However, as the transient signal in 10Mb Ethernet is so
small, in terms of the number of wavelengths of the over-
all signal, we do not believe that there is physically enough
information contained in it for the identiﬁcation of similar
devices. Indeed, it has been shown in the literature that tran-
sient analysis is sufﬁcient only for distinguishing between
devices of different models, but not devices of the same
model. As such, our methodology relies primarily upon the
steady-state portion of the signal for proﬁling purposes.
The ﬁnal portion of the Ethernet frame shown in Figure
2 (denoted by ’. . . . .’) is the beginning of the MAC address
of the receiving device. Preliminary work with this portion
of the signal has shown that it may be possible to use the
MAC source address for signal proﬁling.
3.3. Matched ﬁlter creation
Having identiﬁed a common and repetitive portion of the
Ethernet signal suitable for identiﬁcation purposes, an exact
starting position and period of the portion of the signal to be
matched to must be chosen. We call this part of the signal
the reference signal, and choose it to represent the known
time-domain signal α(t). As per (5), the reference signal
must be reversed in the time-domain, and shifted by t0 to
be used as the ﬁlter. In this respect t0 may be regarded as
the ﬁnal time point of the reference signal.
Initially, the period and position of the reference signal
were chosen as an arbitrary number of points spanning the
length of the synchronization signal. For 10Mb Ethernet,
we have found this acceptable to distinguish between all but
the most similar of signals; however, we have also devel-
oped algorithms to determine the optimal reference signal
for a set of known devices. This type of reference selection
would be useful during a training period, where sample data
could be taken for a new device introduced on the network,
and compared to previously collected data of other devices.
For a general study of the matched ﬁlter, however, we have
selected a reference signal that includes the preamble tran-
Figure 2. The Preamble of an Ethernet frame used for signal proﬁling.
sient and steady-state portion of the synchronization signal,
which is the same, to within ﬁve sample points, for each
device. While optimally determining a reference signal for
a device, in relation to other known devices, may increase
performance, our experiments have shown that it is not gen-
erally necessary to do so.
3.4. Signal proﬁle
The ﬁrst step in creating a signal proﬁle is to apply the
ﬁlter to the signal used to create it; i.e., convolve the ﬁlter
with the portion of the signal used for the selection of the
reference signal. The ﬁlter returns a single value from this
operation that serves as a baseline. This value represents the
ﬁlter response when a perfect match is made between the
ﬁlter and the original signal. If another signal is exactly the
same as the original, then we expect that applying the ﬁlter
to this signal will produce the same value. In general then,
applying the ﬁlter to a signal produces a measurement of the
closeness of the signal to the original, and consequently the
alikeness of the devices the signals were acquired from. If
a signal from a different device approaches the ﬁlter output
value for the original signal too closely then we are unable
to distinguish it from the device that produced the original.
Due to the noise inherent in any system, we cannot as-
sume that even a properly functioning device will output
exactly the same synchronization signal for each frame.
Noise from surrounding devices, created by a hard disc or
CD-ROM being accessed or variations in system load, and
thermal noise assuredly cause slight variations in the sig-
