`AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter` contains a private class
`ServletHandlerMethodResolver` that could be used to tweak URL mappings for
custom requirements if one was able to subclass it. Furthermore it would be
very cool to use in test cases as you could easily test if you mappings work
for certain requests. Currently you have to use
`AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter` directly and thus execute the method
entirely.
