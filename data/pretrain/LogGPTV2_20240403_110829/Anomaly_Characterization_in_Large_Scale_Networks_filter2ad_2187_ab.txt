at time k if and only if B is an r-consistent set at time k and
∀j ∈ [[1, n]] \ B, B ∪ {j} is not an r-consistent set at time k.
Figure 1 illustrates these two above notions. It depicts the
position of six devices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} at time k in a one
dimension QoS space E (i.e., the number of accessed services
is equal to one). The distance between any two devices of
B1 = {1, 2, 3, 4} (resp. of B2 = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}) is not larger
than 2r and thus they belong to the same r-consistent set.

{1, 2, 3, 5, 6} containing point 1. Any subset of B1 and any subset of B2 is
an r-consistent set.
The two r-consistent sets B1 and B2 containing device 1 are
maximal because adding device 5 or 6 to B1 or adding 4 to
B2 would make them non r-consistent.
From these two above notions, we derive the concept of
consistent motions. A motion reﬂects the fact that the QoS of
a set of devices keep close to each other at successive discrete
times. Formally,
Deﬁnition 3 (r-consistent motion): For any r ∈ [0, 1/4), a
subset B ⊆ [[1, n]] has an r-consistent motion in the time
interval [k − 1, k] if B is an r-consistent set at both times
k − 1 and k. Moreover, a subset B ⊆ [[1, n]] has a maximal
r-consistent motion in the time interval [k − 1, k] if B has
[k − 1, k] and
an r-consistent motion in the time interval
∀j ∈ [[1, n]]\ B, B ∪{j} does not have an r-consistent motion
in the time interval [k − 1, k] .
Remark 1: If B has an r-consistent motion in the time
interval [k−1, k] , either B has a maximal r-consistent motion
or there exists B(cid:2) ⊆ [[1, n]], B ⊆ B(cid:2) such that B(cid:2) has a
maximal r-consistent motion.
Finally, we classify r-consistent motions according to the
number of devices that belong to these motions. This notion
will be central for the modelling of errors or events.
Deﬁnition 4 (τ-dense and τ-sparse motions): For any r ∈
[0, 1/4), τ ∈ [[1, n− 1]], and for any subset B ⊆ [[1, n]] having
an r-consistent motion in the time interval [k−1, k] , if |B| > τ
then B is said to have a τ-dense r-consistent motion (or simply
a τ-dense motion) in [k − 1, k] , otherwise B has a τ-sparse
r-consistent motion (or simply a τ-sparse motion) in [k−1, k] .
C. Modelling the Impact of Errors

As said in Section III-A, each device j at time k feeds
an error detection function ak(j) with pk(j) where pk(j) =
(q1,k(j), . . . , qd,k(j)). If the variation of quality is considered

this device in the quality space E.
Deﬁnition 5 (Abnormal Trajectory): A point j ∈ [[1, n]] has
an abnormal trajectory in the time interval [k−1, k] if ak(j) =
true. The subset of points having an abnormal trajectory in
the time interval [k − 1, k] is denoted by Ak. Formally,
Ak = {j ∈ [[1, n]] | ak(j) = true} .
As previously argued, the main objective of this work is to
give each device – whose QoS of consumed services has been

not the period of time during which the modiﬁed QoS is exhibited.

impacted by some error – the capability to accurately decide
whether such an error has also affected many other devices
or solely a few of them. This boils down for each device to
locally determine the presence of similarity features in the
abnormal behaviour of other devices. As presented above,
this is achieved by modelling devices QoS by points in the
QoS space E, and the temporal evolution of their QoS by
trajectories in E so that, at each time k, state Sk represents
the QoS of all devices. We show in the following that each
device only needs to know the trajectories of devices that
are at no more than 4r from itself. A wider knowledge –
as the one got by an omniscient observer that samples at
each time k the system state, i.e., Sk – does not bring any
additional information and thus does not provide a higher error
detection accuracy (see Theorems 5, 6, and 7 and Corollary 8
in Section V).
From these periodic samplings of the system state, one
can construct several plausible scenarios of errors that would
explain the trajectories of each device. For instance if a group
of points follow the same abnormal trajectories at different
observations, it should be caused by the same error. Similarly,
if some point shows an abnormal trajectory that moves it
away from its previous neighbours it should be due to some
isolated error. On the other hand, there are scenario of errors
that cannot be captured by periodic snapshots, as for example
the fact that some device has been hit by simultaneous or
temporally close errors between two successive snapshots.
We encapsulate these indistinguishable scenarios of errors by
imposing the following restrictions on the impact of errors on
devices QoS.
In the time interval [k−1, k] , the abnormal trajectory
of each device j ∈ Ak is due to a single error.
R1:
R2: An error has a similar effect on the abnormal tra-
jectories of all impacted devices. In particular if a
set of devices belonging to the same r-consistent set
are impacted by a given error in the time interval
[k−1, k] then all these devices will undergo the same
abnormal trajectories and thus by Deﬁnition 3 will
follow the same r-consistent motion in [k − 1, k] .
If strictly less than τ + 1 devices have an abnormal
trajectory due to the same error then none of these
devices can belong to a τ-dense motion. Moreover, if
a device belongs to a τ-dense motion then this device
has necessarily been impacted by an error that has
impacted many other devices (not necessarily those
following the same motion).
R3:
Note that a single error can impact devices whose QoS can
be arbitrarily different. Restrictions R1, R2 and R3 are taken
into account by partitioning the set of devices in Ak into τ-
dense motion subsets and τ-sparse motion subsets such that (i)
all the τ-sparse motion subsets are sufﬁciently ”far” from each
other so that any combination of several of them cannot form
τ-dense motion subsets, and (ii) any single τ-sparse motion
subset is sufﬁciently ”far” from any τ-dense motion one so
that this τ-sparse motion subset cannot merge with a τ-dense

one. This partitioning of Ak is formally deﬁned as follows.
Deﬁnition 6 (Anomaly partition Pk): For any k ≥ 1, τ ∈
[[1, n − 1]], r ∈ [0, 1/4), the partition Pk of Ak is said to be
an anomaly partition at time k if it is made of non-empty and
disjoint r-consistent motions B1, . . . , B(cid:2) that verify conditions
C1 and C2 below. Subsets B1, . . . , B(cid:2) are called anomalies.

C2:
|Bj|≤τ Bj, B ∪ Bi has not a r-consistent motion.
By extension, for any point j ∈ Ak, Pk(j) represents the
(unique) subset B ∈ Pk such that j ∈ B.
C1:
In spite of the apparent complexity of Deﬁnition 6, the
following lemma shows that given Ak, Sk−1, Sk, τ and r,
there always exists at least one anomaly partition.
Lemma 2: For any k ≥ 1, for any Ak (cid:10)= ∅, for any system
states Sk−1 and Sk, τ ∈ [[1, n−1]] and r ∈ [0, 1/4), there exists
at least one partition Pk of Ak such that Pk is an anomaly
partition. In the general case, it is not unique.
Proof: We ﬁrst prove the existence of anomaly partitions,
and then their non uniqueness.
A simple way to build an anomaly partition Pk of Ak is
described in Algorithm 1. After having initialized Pk to an
empty set and S to Ak, all the points of S are examined
as follows. Let j be any random point taken from S, and
B any subset of S that has a maximal r-consistent motion
in S involving j. B is added to Pk and all the elements
of B are removed from S. The size of S is monotonically
decreasing and thus this algorithm terminates. We now prove
by induction that at each iteration, Pk satisﬁes conditions
C1 and C2 of Deﬁnition 6. The ﬁrst element added in Pk
has a maximal motion. Being the ﬁrst element of Pk, both
conditions C1 and C2 hold. Now suppose that up to iteration
n ≥ 1 both conditions C1 and C2 hold. At the end of iteration
m = n + 1, the new element B of Pk has a maximal r-
consistent motion among all the remaining points of S. By
construction, ∀(cid:2) ∈ [[1, n]], B(cid:2) ∈ Pk has a maximal r-consistent
motion among all the remaining points of S \ ∪i τ. Otherwise
it is called an isolated anomaly. The set of devices impacted
by a massive anomaly in the time interval [k− 1, k] is denoted
= {j ∈ Ak | |Pk(j)| > τ}.
by MPk. Formally, we have MPk
Similarly, the set of devices impacted by an isolated anomaly
in the time interval [k − 1, k] is denoted by IPk. We have
IPk
To summarize, let Pk be an anomaly partition, we have
= {j ∈ Ak | |Pk(j)| ≤ τ}.

We suppose in the following that all the errors or events
that occur in the system respect restrictions R1, R2 and R3.
In this (ideal) context, there exists an anomaly partition that
reconstructs exactly what really happens in the system. In the
following we denote by Rk, k ≥ 1, this real scenario of errors,
and by respectively MRk and IRk the set of devices that have
been involved in respectively massive and isolated anomalies.
We show in Theorem 3, that even in this ideal context, an
