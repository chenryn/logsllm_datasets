canceled or reduced, just as it is today in half duplex radios.
We use similar experiments for OFDM-wideband signals to quan-
tify the power levels of the different distortions, shown in the left
side of Fig. 2.
In a typical WiFi radio using 80MHz bandwidth,
the receiver has a noise ﬂoor of −90dBm (1 picowatt). First, since
the main signal component is being transmitted at 20dBm (100mW),
self-interference from the linear main component is 20 − (−90) =
110dB above the receiver noise ﬂoor. Second, we observed exper-
imentally that the non-linear harmonics are at −10dBm, or 80dB
above the receiver noise ﬂoor. Finally, the transmitter noise is at
−40dBm, or 50dB above the receiver noise ﬂoor. Note that these
numbers are consistent with other RF measurement studies reported
in the literature [21] for standard WiFi radios.
• Any full duplex system needs to provide 110dB of linear self-
interference cancellation to reduce self-interference to the receiver
There are four takeaways from the above analysis:
noise ﬂoor. This will ensure that the strongest component (the main
signal) which is 110dB above the noise ﬂoor will be eliminated.
• A full duplex system has to reduce non-linear harmonic components
that are 80dB above the noise ﬂoor, so any full duplex technique has
to provide at least 80dB of non-linear self-interference cancella-
tion.
• Transmitter noise is by deﬁnition noise and is random.
In other
words, we cannot infer it by any algorithm. Hence the only way to
cancel transmitter noise is to get a copy of it where it is generated,
i.e.
in the analog domain and cancel it there. This implies any
full duplex system has to have an analog cancellation component
that provides at least 50dB of analog noise cancellation so that
transmitter noise is reduced to below the receiver noise ﬂoor.
• A ﬁnal constraint is that RX chains in radios get saturated if the
input signal is beyond a particular level that is determined by their
ADC resolution. Assuming a 12 bit ADC resolution typically found
in commodity WiFi radios, we have a theoretical 72dB of dynamic
range, which implies that the strongest signal level that can be input
to the radio relative to the receiver noise ﬂoor is −90dBm+72 =
−18dBm. However, in practice it is necessary to leave 2 bits worth
of margin, i.e a 12 bit ADC should be used as if it is a 10 bit ADC to
reduce quantization noise. So the maximum input signal level can
be −90dBm+60 = −30dBm. Since in WiFi, the transmitted self-
interference can be as high as 20dBm, a full duplex system needs
to have an analog cancellation stage that provides 60dB of self-
interference reduction (we keep a further 10dB margin for OFDM
PAPR where instantaneously an OFDM signal’s power level can
rise 10dB above the average power).
To sum up, any full duplex design needs to provide 110dB of linear
cancellation, 80dB of non-linear cancellation, and 60dB of analog
cancellation.
Figure 2: On the left hand side we see transmitted signal with sub-
components. On the right hand side we see how this impacts the requirements
of analog and digital cancellation.
2.2 Do Prior Full Duplex Techniques Satisfy these
Requirements?
There are two state-of-the-art designs: ones which use an extra
transmit chain to generate a cancellation signal in analog [6] and
ones which tap the transmitted signal in analog for cancellation [11,
3]; both use a combination of analog and digital cancellation. Note
that all these designs use at least two antennas for transmit and re-
ceive instead of the normal single antenna, and the antenna geometry
ones use more than two.
Designs which use an extra transmitter chain report an overall to-
tal of 80dB of self-interference cancellation (we have been able to
reproduce their results experimentally). Of this, around 50dB is ob-
tained in the analog domain by antenna separation and isolation be-
tween the TX and RX antennas of around 40cm (the designs also

and RX antennas to achieve 50dB isolation). Note that this 50dB
reduction applies to the entire signal, including linear and non-linear
components as well as transmitter noise since it is pure analog sig-
nal attenuation. Next, these designs also use an extra transmit chain
to inject an antidote signal [6, 9] that is supposed to cancel the self-
interference in analog. However, the antidote signal only models
linear self-interference components and does not model non-linear
components. Further, it is incapable of modeling noise because by
deﬁnition noise is random and cannot be modeled. Overall this extra
cancellation stage provides another 30dB of linear self-interference
cancellation in the best case. Thus, these designs provide 80dB of
linear cancellation, 50dB of non-linear cancellation and 50dB of ana-
log noise cancellation, falling short of the requirements by 30dB for
the non-linear components. Hence if full duplex is enabled over links
whose half duplex SNR is 30dB or lower, then no signal will be de-
coded. Further to see any throughput improvements with full duplex,
the half duplex link SNR would have to be greater than 50dB.
The second design [11] gets a copy of the transmitted analog signal
and uses a component called the balun (a transformer) in the analog
domain to then create a perfectly inverted copy of the signal. The
inverted signal is then connected to a circuit that adjusts the delay
and attenuation of the inverted signal to match the self interference
that is being received on the RX antenna from the TX antenna. We
show experimentally in Sec. 5, that this achieves only 25dB of ana-
log cancellation, consistent with the prior work’s results. The can-
cellation is limited because this technique is very sensitive to and
requires precise programmable delays with resolution as precise as
10picoseconds to exactly match the delay experienced by the self-
interference from the TX to the RX antenna. Such programmable
delays are extremely hard to build in practice, at best we could ﬁnd
programmable delays with resolution of 100− 1000picoseconds and
these were in fact the ones used by the prior design [11]. Hence
the cancellation circuit is never able to perfectly recreate the inverted
self-interference signal and therefore cancellation is limited to 25dB
in analog. However this design also uses two separate antennas sep-
arated by 20cm for TX and RX and achieves another 30dB in analog
cancellation via antenna isolation. Hence a total of 55dB of self-
interference reduction is obtained in analog, this cancellation applies
to all the signal components (linear, non-linear and noise). The digi-
tal cancellation stage of this design also only models the linear main
signal component, it does not model the non-linear harmonics that
we discussed above. Thus we found that we obtain another 30dB of
linear cancellation from digital in this design.
Overall, the second design provides 85dB of linear self-interference
cancellation, 55dB of non-linear cancellation and 55dB of analog
noise cancellation. Thus this design falls short of the requirements
by 25dB (especially for the non-linear component). Hence if full du-
plex is enabled over links whose half duplex SNR is 25dB or lower,
then no signal will be decoded. Further to see any throughput im-
provements with full duplex, the half duplex link SNR would have
to be greater than 45dB.
3. OUR DESIGN
In this section we describe the design of our self-interference can-
cellation technique. Our design is a single antenna system (i.e. the
same antenna is used to simultaneously transmit and receive), wide-
band (can handle the widest WiFi bandwidth of 80MHz as well as all
the LTE bandwidths) and truly full duplex (cancels all self-interference
to the receiver noise ﬂoor). The design is a hybrid, i.e., it has both
analog and digital cancellation stages. Note that our hybrid cancel-
lation architecture is not novel, similar architectures have been pro-
posed in prior work [11, 20, 19]. The novelty of our work lies in
the design of the cancellation circuits and algorithms, as well as their
Figure 3: Full duplex radio block diagram. Tb is intended baseband signal
we think we are transmitting, but in fact the transmit signal is T (red). The
intended receive signal is R (green), however we see strong components of
the red signal the RX side. Some of these red signals are undesirably leaked
through the circulator. The analog cancellation circuit is trying to recreate a
signal that matches the leaked interference signal for cancellation. The digital
cancellation stage eliminates any residual self interference.
performance. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst technique
that achieves 110dB of cancellation and eliminates self-interference
to the noise ﬂoor.
3.1 Analog Cancellation
We introduce a novel analog cancellation circuit and tuning algo-
rithm that robustly provides at least 60dB of self-interference cancel-
lation. Fig. 3 shows the high level design of the circuit and where it
is placed in the radio architecture. A single antenna is connected to
a circulator (at port 2), which is a 3 port device that provides limited
isolation between port 1 and port 3 while letting signals pass through
consecutive ports as seen in Fig. 3. The TX signal is fed through
port 1, which routes it to the antenna connected to port 2, while the
received signal from the antenna is passed from port 2 through to
port 3. Circulator cannot completely isolate port 1 and port 3, so
inevitably the TX signal leaks from port 1 to port 3 and causes inter-
ference to the received signal. From our experiments we ﬁnd that the
circulator only provides 15dB of isolation, i.e., the self-interference
that is leaking to the RX circuit is reduced only by 15dB. To get to
the noise ﬂoor, we still have to provide 95dB of cancellation, and
at least 45 dB of that has to come in analog to ensure transmitter
noise is sufﬁciently canceled and we do not saturate the receiver. We
accomplish this using our novel analog cancellation circuit that we
describe next. Note that when we report analog cancellation perfor-
mance numbers, we include the 15dB of reduction we get from the
circulator for simplicity of description.
Fig. 3 shows the design of our analog cancellation circuit. We
tap the TX chain to obtain a small copy of the transmitted signal
just before it goes to the circulator. This copy therefore includes the
transmitter noise introduced by the TX chain. The copy of the signal
is then passed through a circuit which consists of parallel ﬁxed lines
of varying delays (essentially wires of different lengths) and tunable
attenuators. The lines are then collected back and added up, and this
combined signal is then subtracted from the signal on the receive
path.
In effect, the circuit is providing us copies of the transmit-
ted signal delayed by different ﬁxed amounts and programmatically
attenuated by different variable amounts. The key challenge is to

attenuators appropriately so that the we maximize self-interference
cancellation. Note that unlike prior work our design uses compo-
nents that are all available off-the-shelf and is therefore easy to man-
ufacture, we do not need sophisticated high resolution programmable
delays that are hard to build like in prior work [11].
The design of our cancellation circuit is based on a novel insight:
we can view cancellation as a sampling and interpolation problem.
The actual self-interference signal has a particular delay and ampli-
tude that depends on the delay d and attenuation a through the circu-
lator. Our insight (the reason for which will become clear shortly) is
that we should pick the ﬁxed delays in our cancellation circuit such
that they straddle the delay of the self-interference signal through
the circulator. So if we have N ﬁxed delay lines, N/2 of those lines
should be placed at equidistant intervals all of which have delays that
are less than the delay of the self-interference d, and we should do
the same for the other half of the delays but greater than d. In prac-
tice it is hard to know the precise value of d since it is a function of
how the circuit is put together, but we can always ﬁnd the range over
which it varies and place our ﬁxed delays outside of that range on
either side.
At this stage we have leading and lagging copies of the transmitted
self-interference signal, how might we use them to approximate the
actual self-interference itself at some intermediate instant? If we take
a step back, this is essentially an interpolation problem, similar to
Nyquist digital sampling. In Nyquist digital sampling, we have dis-
crete samples of the signal at a time period equal to the inverse of the
sampling frequency. The Nyquist theorem [13] tells us that sampling
(at the Nyquist rate) does not lose information, in other words we
can always reconstruct the signal at any instant as a weighted linear
combination of samples taken before and after the instant at which
we want to recreate. The weights of the linear combination can be
determined by using a standard algorithm called sinc interpolation.
The basic idea is that you overlay sinc pulses at each sampling time
instant and calculate the value of the sinc pulse at the time instant t
where you wish to recreate the signal. This value gives the weight
you should apply to this sample when you take the linear combina-
tion for reconstruction. We repeat this algorithm for every sample
to determine the corresponding weight to apply to it. The value of
the signal at time t is then given by the linear combination of all the
samples with weights calculated by the sinc trick discussed above.
Our analog cancellation circuit is in effect implementing the same
trick, at every instant we have copies of the signal at different equally
spaced delays just like in digital sampling. The programmable atten-
uators essentially function as the weights we need to apply in the lin-
ear combination for reconstruction. Similar to digital sampling, we
need to estimate the self interference at an instant d that lies some-
where in between these ﬁxed delays d1, . . . , dN as shown in Fig. 4.
To do so, the weights for each sample, i.e., the value of the atten-
uator that we need to set on each line i is equal to the value of the
sinc pulse centered at the ﬁxed delay di at instant d. If we adjust the
attenuators for each delay line to those values, then we will be able
to perfectly reconstruct the self interference and cancel it from the
receive path. Fig. 4 shows this algorithm visually in action.
In practice however, there is an important difference with digi-
tal sampling. In digital, we can take linear combinations of a very
large number of samples since memory is essentially free. To do that
in analog we would need a correspondingly large number of delay
lines. In practice, this is not possible due to a variety of reasons,
ranging from space limitations to power consumption to electromag-
netic radiations. Our key insight is that in interpolation, the samples
that matter most are the ones that are closest to the instant t at which
the signal is being reconstructed. Intuitively, the value of a signal at
Figure 4: This ﬁgure shows how we can recreate the self interference signal
which is located at instant d, positioned between the ﬁxed delay lines di. The
value of the attenuator ai for delay di is given by the value taken by the sinc
centered at di at instant d.
a much further/before time than t should not affect the value of the
signal at t. This is reﬂected in the fact that the weights in the linear
combination for these further out samples are nearly zero. This al-
lows our analog circuit to therefore use a small number of delay lines
and still approximate the self interference fairly well. We show in
Sec. 5 that sixteen delay lines are sufﬁcient to approximate the self
interference signal leaking through the circulator. Further, we will
show in Sec. 5 that our analog cancellation delivers at least 60dB
cancellation comfortably exceeding the requirements we developed
in Sec. 2.1.
3.2 Digital Cancellation
The goal of digital cancellation is to clean out any remaining resid-
ual self-interference. Assuming that analog cancellation provides
60dB, digital cancellation has to cancel the linear main signal com-
ponent by another 50dB and non-linear components by another 20dB.
We address each of these components separately.
3.2.1 Canceling Linear Components
The ﬁrst part of digital cancellation eliminates the residual linear
components of the self-interference. This consists of the main trans-
mitted signal that is leaking over through the circulator after analog
cancellation, as well as any delayed reﬂections of this signal from
the environment. The reﬂections are also delayed and attenuated by
different unknown amounts.
The basic idea is that this part of the self-interference can be mod-
eled as a linear and non-causal function of the transmitted signal as
we know it in digital (recall that we know the baseband IQ samples
of the transmitted packet). The non-causal bit is important, since we
know the samples of the entire packet that was transmitted, we can
use samples from the future to estimate the self-interference at the
current instant. In other words, the received sample y[n] at any in-
stant can be modeled as a linear combination of up to k samples of
the known transmitted signal x[n] before and after the instant n. The
