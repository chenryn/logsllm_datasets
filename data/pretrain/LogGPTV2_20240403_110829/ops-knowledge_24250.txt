Subject: Creating ISO Files for CD/DVD Burning with Python

Dear Chris,

I understand that you are developing a cross-platform application (for Windows and macOS) using wxPython, which will later be compiled into an executable. You also inquired about the possibility of creating ISO files for CDs or DVDs within your Python application to facilitate data disc burning.

While it is technically possible to generate ISO files directly from Python, following the principle of "not reinventing the wheel," I recommend leveraging existing tools designed specifically for this purpose. One such tool is `mkisofs`, part of the `cdrtools` suite. Although `mkisofs` originated on Linux, there are indeed versions available for Windows as well. By integrating this external tool into your Python script, you can efficiently handle the creation of ISO files without delving into complex file system manipulations yourself.

To get started, you might want to look into how to call `mkisofs` via subprocess in Python, allowing your application to create ISO images seamlessly across both platforms. Remember to ensure that `mkisofs` is properly installed and accessible on the user's system for your solution to work effectively.

Best regards,
