### Issue with FreeCodeCamp Challenge: "Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements"

**Description:**
I encountered an issue while completing the challenge titled "Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements" on FreeCodeCamp (URL: [http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-css-selectors-to-style-elements](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-css-selectors-to-style-elements)).

**Problem:**
Before I had a chance to place the closing curly bracket in my CSS code, the challenge was marked as completed. This premature completion is misleading and does not accurately reflect the completion of the task.

**Screenshot:**
For reference, I have attached a screenshot that illustrates the issue.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to the challenge at [http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-css-selectors-to-style-elements](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-use-css-selectors-to-style-elements).
2. Start writing the CSS code but do not add the closing curly bracket.
3. Observe that the challenge is marked as completed prematurely.

**Expected Behavior:**
The challenge should only be marked as completed once all necessary code, including the closing curly bracket, has been correctly added.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
