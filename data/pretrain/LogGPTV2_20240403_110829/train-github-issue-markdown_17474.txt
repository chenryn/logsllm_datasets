There are several knobs in the plugins used by the fluentd setups, but none of
them are exposed to users of the images. It would be great to have that,
without requiring custom images: they're more work, tend to rot, etc.
I noticed that td-agent.conf supports an `@ include` directive. Would that
work, along with drop-in files in e.g. /etc/td-agent/conf.d/? Is there a way
perhaps to inject environment variables into configurations? I can help with
PRs once there's agreement on which approach to choose.
