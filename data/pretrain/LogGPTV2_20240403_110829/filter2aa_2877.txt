## An Example
(Adapted from Broward Horne's DC13 talk)

## My Need
- When I used to teach, students often sought my advice on job searching.
- I tried to stay updated with industry trends to provide relevant guidance.
- I discovered that Craigslist postings can serve as an interesting indicator of market dynamics, even if not the best source for jobs.

## (A Tiny Bit of) Theory
- Job postings are a lagging economic indicator.
- There is a time lag between economic changes and the corresponding shifts in the job market.
- Hiring is typically a long-term investment, whereas many Craigslist postings are for temporary, contract, or side jobs, which are short-term investments.
- This can help shorten the lag between economic changes and job market adjustments.

## Why Craigslist?
- **Availability**: The data is easily accessible.
- **Categorization**: Decent categorization with 31 job categories across 400 cities in North America.
- **Relevance**: Significant amount of short-term relevance in both job listings and other items and services.
- **Prediction**: Craigslist data can serve as a normal to leading indicator of change. While it may not be the only or best source, it is a valuable example of open data.

## Let's Look at Some Data
### Initial Results
- The initial findings are preliminary.
- More questions have arisen than answers, but this is part of the exploration process.

## Conclusions
- This analysis is in its early stages.
- There is clear significance in the data.
- My goal is to share this idea and explore further possibilities.
- There is a wealth of information hidden in the data being collected around us, much of which is openly available. What more can we discover?
