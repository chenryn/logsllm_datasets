An Example
(blatently stolen from Broward Horne's DC13 talk)
My Need
● When I used to teach...
● Students would come to me seeking job search 
advice
● I would do what I could to keep up with trends
● Found that craigslist postings were an interesting 
indicator of what was going on
– Not necessarily the best source for jobs – but definitely 
an interesting sensor
(a tiny bit of) Theory
● Jobs are a lagging economic indicator
● There is a time period between economies 
changing and the job markets catching up
● Hiring someone tends to be long term investment
● A lot of craigslist postings are temporary / 
contract / side jobs
● Short term investment
● Shorten the lag
Why Craigslist?
● It's available
● Decent categorization
● 31 job categories, 400 cities in North America
● More than just job listings
● Significant amount of short-term relevance
● Both in job listings and other items & services
● Prediction:
● This will be a normal to leading indicator of change
● This is not the only or best source for data – it is 
just one example of the many out there
Let's look at some data
● Initial results
● The easy-to-find stuff
● More questions than answers
● But that is the fun of it

Conclusions
● This is in the very early stages
● Clearly there is some significance here
● My goal is to throw this idea out and see what 
else can be done with it
● There is all sorts of interesting information 
hidden in the data that is being collected all 
around us – and huge amounts are openly 
available – what can we find in it?

some not-so-relevant
