This Stackoverflow question brings the confusing matrix dimensions used in the
`imshow` documentation to our attention.

According to the docstring one may use arrays of shapes `(n, m)` etc. which
are then named `MxN`.
However, according to wikipedia
> A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m Ã— n matrix or m-by-n
> matrix.
This is also the convention used by numpy, e.g. the arrays.ndarray.html speaks
about
> A 2-dimensional array of size 2 x 3, composed of 4-byte integer elements:  
>  `x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)`
The documentation should therefore either speak of
  * shape `(n, m)`, or `n x m` array (`nxm` looks strange)
  * shape `(N, M)` or `NxM` array
  * shape `(m, n)` or `m x n` array
  * shape `(M, N)` or `M x N` array
Now, which is better? All capitalized or not, `n` or `m` being rows?
