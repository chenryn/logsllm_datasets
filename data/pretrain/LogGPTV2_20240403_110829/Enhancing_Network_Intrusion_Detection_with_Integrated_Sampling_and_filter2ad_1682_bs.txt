**Abstract:** A Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) is a distributed communication platform for mobile wireless nodes. Due to the lack of a centralized monitoring point, intrusion detection systems (IDS) for MANET are typically developed using a distributed architecture where detectors are deployed at each node to cooperatively detect attacks. However, most of these distributed IDS assume that each detector exchanges complete information with their peers, leading to high communication overhead. We propose a Distributed Evidence-driven Message Exchanging Intrusion Detection Model (DEMEM) for MANET that allows distributed detectors to cooperatively detect routing attacks with minimal communication overhead. The framework enables detectors to exchange evidence only when necessary. Under a few practical assumptions, we implement DEMEM to detect routing attacks in the Optimal Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol. Our experimental results demonstrate that DEMEM can detect routing attacks with low message overhead and delay, no false negatives, and very low false positives under various mobility conditions with message loss. Ongoing work includes implementing DEMEM in AODV, DSR, and TBRPF, and developing a reputation-based cooperative intrusion response model.

### 1. Introduction

A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consists of mobile nodes that communicate with each other without a pre-established infrastructure. In a MANET, mobile nodes act as routers to forward packets and exchange routing messages to establish their routing tables. Generally, a MANET assumes that each node provides correct routing information and acts as a router to cooperatively forward packets. By exploiting these assumptions, a malicious node can easily corrupt the routing ability of the network by sending incorrect routing messages. Although cryptographic schemes can protect forwarded packets from being modified, they cannot prevent a node from initiating a packet with forged contents. Therefore, additional mechanisms must be developed to complement cryptographic approaches.

Intrusion detection (ID) is a viable approach to this problem, but current intrusion detection solutions in wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET due to new challenges such as fully distributed audit data, limited bandwidth, numerous unknown attacks, and insufficient local information for detectors. Recently, researchers have developed distributed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for detecting insider attacks in MANET. However, none of these IDS has a practical message exchange mechanism to supply sufficient data for their IDS. The exchange of information between distributed detectors tends to have a high overhead, while MANET has limited resources.

Our work makes two major contributions to intrusion detection in MANET. First, we propose a practical and effective message exchange model: Distributed Evidence-driven Message Exchanging Intrusion Detection Model (DEMEM) for MANET. DEMEM overcomes the challenge of distributed detectors in MANET without sufficient data to detect routing attacks. Instead of adopting costly promiscuous monitoring, detectors in DEMEM simply intercept routing messages and validate them for detecting routing attacks. Additionally, DEMEM segregates the duties of security agents and routing services to avoid modifying the routing protocols. The efficient evidence-driven message exchange mechanism provides sufficient evidence to perform scalable distributed intrusion detection at each node.

Second, we implement DEMEM in the proactive routing protocol in MANET, Optimal Link State Routing (OLSR), with four practical assumptions and three new proposed ID messages specifically for OLSR. DEMEM in OLSR uses detection constraints from our previous detection model proposed in RAID 2005. The detection model shows that by validating consistency among related routing messages according to detection constraints, detectors can precisely detect both known and unknown insider routing attacks in OLSR. We observe that if detectors within two hops can exchange their routing information, they will have sufficient evidence for constraints of intrusion detection. Thus, we propose three ID messages for DEMEM in OLSR: ID-Evidence, ID-Forward, and ID-Request. ID-Evidence ensures each detector has sufficient evidence for detection constraints; ID-Forward triggers the selected forwarders to send ID-Evidence when the detector observes new evidence, minimizing message overhead; and ID-Request handles message loss. DEMEM not only performs practical, scalable, and accurate intrusion detection in OLSR but also tolerates message loss with low message overhead. Additionally, DEMEM can be applied to other routing protocols in MANET, such as TBRPF, AODV, and DSR, with different ID messages tailored for each protocol.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 compares current IDS and cryptographic works with DEMEM. Section 3 discusses threats in MANET and the challenges of developing IDS for MANET, especially the lack of an efficient message exchange framework among detectors. Section 4 presents the design of our proposed message exchange framework, DEMEM. Section 5 implements DEMEM in OLSR, a proactive protocol in MANET. Section 6 demonstrates how DEMEM detects OLSR routing attacks through an example scenario and experiment results from the simulation. In Section 7, we discuss ongoing work, and we conclude in Section 8.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) on wired networks generally employ two models: signature-based and anomaly-based approaches. A signature-based IDS monitors activities on the network and compares them with known attacks. However, this approach cannot detect new, unknown threats. An anomaly-based IDS monitors network traffic and compares it with normal behavior patterns statistically. The issue with anomaly-based approaches is that they yield high false positives in wired networks. If applied to MANET, the false positive problem would be worse due to the unpredictable topology changes caused by node mobility. Various IDSs for wired networks have a centralized point that can aggregate all traffic for analysis. This centralized IDS structure is not feasible for a fully distributed MANET. To resolve the lack of central authority, hierarchical IDSs have been proposed. However, these hierarchical structures are only conceptual models that have not been realized due to high costs. Thus, we propose DEMEM as a practical and effective intrusion prevention approach with low message overhead for MANET.

Several proposals use cryptographic techniques to secure the integrity of routing messages in MANET. These secure protocols have three drawbacks. First, although key cryptography can protect the integrity of forwarded packets, it cannot prevent a node from initiating a new message with incorrect information. Second, these secure protocols require heavy computation and key distribution involved in public key cryptography, which is too expensive for MANET, as mobile nodes usually have limited power and bandwidth. Finally, these cryptographic schemes are still vulnerable to malicious insiders who possess the keys to communicate in the network.

Numerous IDSs have been proposed for various aspects of MANET threats. Some use statistics-based and credit-based approaches to address packet dropping problems in MANET. A general cooperative IDS architecture for MANET was first proposed by Zhang and Lee. A cooperative specification-based IDS for AODV routing protocols has been discussed. A secure link state routing for MANET involves attaching certified keys to the link state updates flooded within a specified zone. A secure OLSR protocol has been developed to prevent replay attacks by using a timestamp to verify the freshness of a message. The advantage of DEMEM is that it only intercepts routing messages between the routing layer and the IP layer instead of modifying the routing protocol. Therefore, DEMEM can support other MANET routing protocols by specifying different rules for the specific target protocol.

### 3. Threats and Challenges of Intrusion Detection in MANET

#### 3.1 Threats in MANET

Several studies have been conducted on the vulnerabilities of MANET protocols. There are two types of packets transmitted in MANET: routing packets, used for maintaining routes, and data packets, which are the actual data communicated between source and destination. MANET has many intrinsic properties that make it more vulnerable to attacks than wired networks. First, every node in MANET functions as a router responsible for routing and packet delivery. If a node is compromised and exploits the cooperative nature among mobile nodes, the entire network can suffer, including incorrect routing topology and delivery failures. Second, all nodes in MANET share public channels, making it easy for attackers to target any victim node without passing through physical protection lines at gateways. Third, the topology in MANET is dynamic and unpredictable due to mobility. Finally, MANET is a fully distributed environment that lacks an authorized central point to validate message correctness. Because of the last two vulnerabilities, a malicious node can send incorrect routing information to its surrounding nodes, causing routing failures without being noticed by others. Designing protocols that assume every node will send correct messages and that every node is cooperative to forward correct messages makes MANET susceptible to attacks. It is clear that a corrupt node can easily exploit these assumptions to break the cooperation of all nodes.

#### 3.2 Attack Model

Routing and data delivery are two fundamental services in MANET. Attackers can easily disrupt routing topology by manipulating routing packets, causing delivery failures of data packets. Based on the fundamental characteristics of attack packets, we analyze these attacks into three categories:

1. **Forge Initiated Routing Packets:** Attackers can disrupt routing tables by initiating forged routing packets that are then broadcast to the network. The contents of the initiated routing packets are usually the fundamental bases (e.g., 1-hop neighbor information) to build up the routing topology. Unfortunately, forged routing data in the initiated packets will propagate through flooding, leading to routing failures due to corrupted routing topology. Detecting initiated routing packets with forged data is challenging because these forged packets follow the specification of routing protocols and thus have no difference from good packets. Cryptographic techniques used to authenticate the originators cannot detect initiated packets with forged contents because the attacker is the originator who signed the forged packets with legal keys. This type of attack uses atomic attack methods and can be manipulated by an attacker to launch more powerful compound attacks. DEMEM provides IDS capabilities to detect this type of attack precisely.

2. **Forge Forwarded Routing Packets and Node Identity:** Attackers can also disrupt the integrity of forwarded routing packets by modifying the contents of packets passing through them. The attacker can also pretend to have received some packet from others and then initiate a non-existing forwarded packet. Detecting this category of attacks is relatively easy, as the contents of forwarded packets must remain the same. Cryptographic techniques can be used to protect the integrity of forwarded packets and the node identity of all routing packets. Many secured routing protocols and cryptographic techniques have been developed to prevent this type of attack. However, most of them utilize RSA-related algorithms, which require high computation and may cause denial-of-service attacks. Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) is built on a one-way key chain technique using a symmetric key, requiring much less computation. DEMEM assumes that TESLA authenticates the content of forwarded routing packets and node identity to prevent this type of attack. This is also part of our ongoing work discussed in Section 7.1.

3. **Drop Forwarded Packets:** A selfish node may drop packets routing through it. Unlike the previous two types of attacks, which may cause routing disasters by a single attacker, this kind of attack is relatively simple and less severe. If a selfish node drops a broadcast routing packet, the dropped packet may still reach every node due to the flooding nature. Additionally, a data packet drop can be detected if the sender does not receive an acknowledgment from the recipient within a reasonable time period. Several reputation-based works have been proposed to prevent nodes from intentionally dropping packets.

#### 3.3 Challenges vs. Requirements of IDS in MANET

Developing IDS for MANET has many difficult challenges that differ from those in wired networks. First, nodes in MANET are expected to be honest routers that work cooperatively. A malicious node may take advantage of this characteristic to launch various routing attacks. These attacks, as shown in the attack model, can be new attacks in MANET and are difficult to detect. A new intrusion detection mechanism must be developed to detect these new attacks.

Second, since MANET is a fully distributed environment without a centralized point, IDS cannot detect these routing attacks if each distributed detector does not have monitoring information from others. Therefore, IDS needs a practical and scalable architecture to gather sufficient evidence to detect the attacks effectively.

Third, due to mobility, the network topology in MANET is highly dynamic, and the changes are unpredictable. Detectors must have sufficient, up-to-date evidence in real-time to detect attacks with low false positives and negatives. Additionally, wireless links between mobile nodes in MANET are much more unreliable than those in a wired network, so the detection mechanism must be capable of tolerating message loss to have sufficient data in time and maintain detection accuracy.

Furthermore, mobile nodes in MANET usually have limited bandwidth and computation power. MANET is very sensitive to message overhead generated by IDS. High-computation mechanisms, such as the public key system, may cause denial-of-service attacks and are not suitable in MANET. For performance considerations, detectors are required to generate low message and computation overhead.

Finally, nodes in MANET do not have trust management between them, such that attacks may propagate and paralyze the network quickly. Detectors should automatically terminate attacks and recover the routing topology in real-time to minimize attack damage. To design a practical and effective IDS, we conclude the essential requirements for satisfying these unique challenges in MANET (see Fig. 1).

| New routing attacks          | Capable of precisely detecting new attacks   |
| Fully distributed environment| Practical and scalable detection architecture|
| Dynamic and unpredictable topology | Sufficient, up-to-date evidence for detection |
| Unreliable wireless link     | Tolerant of message loss                     |
| Limited bandwidth and computation power | Low message and computation overhead       |
| No trust management          | Automatic real-time routing recovery         |

### 4. Distributed Evidence-Driven Message Exchange Intrusion Detection Model (DEMEM)

DEMEM is designed to address the challenges and requirements of intrusion detection in MANET. The model focuses on providing a practical and scalable architecture for gathering sufficient evidence to detect routing attacks with minimal communication overhead. The key components of DEMEM include:

- **Intercept and Validate Routing Messages:** Instead of promiscuously monitoring all network traffic, DEMEM intercepts and validates only the routing messages. This reduces the computational and communication overhead significantly.

- **Segregation of Duties:** DEMEM segregates the duties of security agents and routing services to avoid modifying the routing protocols. This ensures that the security mechanism can be applied to various routing protocols without altering their core functionalities.

- **Efficient Evidence-Driven Message Exchange:** The framework allows detectors to exchange evidence only when necessary, reducing the overall message overhead. This is achieved through the use of three specialized ID messages: ID-Evidence, ID-Forward, and ID-Request.

  - **ID-Evidence:** Ensures that each detector has sufficient evidence for detection constraints.
  - **ID-Forward:** Triggers the selected forwarders to send ID-Evidence when the detector observes new evidence, minimizing message overhead.
  - **ID-Request:** Handles message loss by requesting missing evidence, ensuring that detectors have the necessary data for accurate detection.

By implementing these components, DEMEM can perform practical, scalable, and accurate intrusion detection in MANET, even under various mobility conditions and with message loss. The next sections will delve into the implementation and evaluation of DEMEM in the OLSR protocol.
