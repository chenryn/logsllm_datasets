User: How to install and configure the MySQL database on the CentOS server and implement the master-slave replication function?
Assistant: 1. Install MySQL On the CentOS server, you can install MySQL through the yum package manager. The command is as follows: ``` sudo yum install mysql-server ``` 2. Configure MySQL After the installation is complete, you need to perform some basic configurations on MySQL. First, add the following content to the MySQL configuration file: ``` [mysqld] log-bin=mysql-bin binlog-do-db=example_db server-id=1 ``` Among them, log-bin means to enable binary logging, binlog-do-db specifies the name of the database to be synchronized, and server-id specifies the unique ID of the MySQL server. 3. Configuring master-slave replication Configuring master-slave replication is mainly divided into two steps, namely configuring on the master server and configuring on the slave server. On the master server, the following commands need to be executed: ``` CREATE USER 'repluser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'repluser'@'%'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK; SHOW MASTER STATUS; ``` Among them, CREATE USER is to create a user for accessing the master server from the server, GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE is to authorize this user, FLUSH PRIVILEGES is to refresh permissions, FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is to stop all writing Operation, SHOW MASTER STATUS is to view the status of the master server. Next, execute the following command on the slave server: ``` CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='master_host_name', MASTER_USER='repluser', MASTER_PASSWORD='password', MASTER_LOG_FILE='filename', MASTER_LOG_POS=position; START SLAVE; ``` Among them, MASTER_HOST is the IP address or domain name of the master server, MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD are the user and password created on the master server, MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the values output by the SHOW MASTER STATUS command, which are used to specify where the replication starts. 4. Verify whether the master-slave replication is successful After starting the master-slave replication, you can verify whether it is successful through the following command: ``` SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G ``` If both Slave_IO_Running and Slave_SQL_Running in the output result are YES, it means master-slave Replication has been successful.
