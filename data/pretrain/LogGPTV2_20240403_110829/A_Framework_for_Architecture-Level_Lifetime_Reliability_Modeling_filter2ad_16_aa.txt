This  paper  tackles  the  issue  of  modeling  chip 
lifetime reliability at the architecture level. We propose 
a  new  and  robust  structure-aware  lifetime  reliability 
model  at  the  architecture-level,  where  devices  only 
vulnerable  to  failure  mechanisms  and  the  effective 
stress condition of these devices are taken into account 
for the failure rate of microarchitecture structures. In 
addition, we present this reliability analysis framework 
based  on  a  new  concept,  called  the  FIT  of  reference 
circuit  or  FORC,  which  allows  architects  to  quantify 
failure  rates  without  having  to  delve  into  low-level 
circuit-  and 
the 
implemented architecture. This is done through a one-
time characterization of a reference circuit needed to 
quantify the reference FITs for each class of modeled 
technology  and

this  new  reliability 
modeling  framework,  architects  are  empowered  to 
proceed  with  architecture-level  reliability  analysis 
independent  of 
technological  and  environmental 
parameters.  
1. Introduction† 
for  a  given 
Lifetime  reliability  has  become  one  of  the  major 
concerns in processor microarchitectures implemented 
with  deep  submicron  technologies  [1,2].  Extreme 
scaling  resulting  in  atomic-range  dimensions,  inter- 
and  intra-device  variability,  and  escalating  power 
densities  have  all  contributed  to  this  concern.  At  the 
device- and circuit-level, many reliability models have 
been proposed and empirically  validated by academia 
and industry; as such, the basic mechanisms of failures 
at the low level have been fairly well understood and 
the  models  at  that  level  have  gained  widespread 
acceptance.  For  example,  Black’s  equation  of 
electromigration  [3]  is  a  well-accepted  model  of

the  architecture-level—in 
In recent work, J. Srinivasan et al. [2] and Z. Lu et 
al. [4] have proposed lifetime reliability models for use 
with  single-core  architecture-level,  cycle-accurate 
simulators. These contributions focus on modeling the 
major  failure  mechanisms  including  electromigration 
(EM),  negative  bias  temperature  instability  (NBTI), 
time  dependent  dielectric  breakdown  (TDDB),  stress 
migration (SM) and thermal cycling (TC). However, a 
closer  examination  of  how  these  models  are  put 
together  oftentimes 
reveals  a  number  of  key 
assumptions  that  enable  plausible  abstractions  at  the 
architecture-level;  yet,  these  assumptions  have  to  be 
taken  largely  on  faith  based  on  intuitive  reasoning. 
Some  of  these  key  assumptions  easily  defy  common 
intuition when one tries to extend the models directly 
to  cover  the  entire  chip  composed  of  many  different 
(heterogeneous)  components.  For  example,  in  RAMP 
[2], the baseline (target) total failure rate measured in 
FITs1 is assumed to be evenly distributed across all the 
five  modeled  failure  mechanisms.  This  is  clearly  a 
somewhat  arbitrary  axiom 
failure 
mechanisms  can  be  more  severe  than  others,  and 
technology  scaling  affects  the  failure  mechanisms  in 
different  ways  and  degrees.  In  addition,  lifetime 
reliability  models  proposed  to  this  point  assume  a 
uniform device density  over the chip and an identical 
vulnerability  of  devices  to  failure  mechanisms.  As  a 
result, the failure rates estimated by such models tend 
to be proportional to chip area, regardless of the exact 
component  mix  within 
that  area.  However,  an 
examination  of  the  floorplan  or  photo  micrograph  of 
any  modern  (multi-core)  microprocessor  chip  clearly 
shows  heterogeneity  across  the  die  area—and  the 
consequent limitations of such an assumption.

1  The  standard  method  of  reporting  constant  failure  rates  for 
semiconductor components is Failures in Time (FITs), which is the 
number  of  failures  seen  in  109  hours.  The  mean  time  to  failure 
(MTTF) of a component is inversely related to this constant failure 
rate, i.e., MTTF = 109/FITs.

stress 
The  various  failure  mechanisms  responsible  for 
lifetime  degradation  do  not  contribute  equally  to 
processor core or chip failure. Moreover, the impact of 
failure mechanisms on different parts of the chip may 
vary  dramatically  as  on-chip  devices  are  not  equally 
nor  necessarily  vulnerable  even  to  the  same  failure 
mechanism.  As  a  result,  it  is  incorrect  to  assume  a 
uniform device density over a chip or a subpart of the 
chip  and  an  identical  vulnerability  of  the  devices  to 
failure  mechanisms,  regardless  of  what  is  actually 
implemented  over  the  chip  area.  In  other  words,  an 
accurate architectural lifetime reliability model should 
carefully consider the vulnerability of basic structures 
of  the  microarchitecture  (e.g.,  arrays,  register  files, 
latches, logic, etc., composing operational units across 
the  chip)  to  different  types  of  failures  by  analyzing 
their effective defect density, taking into account their 
effective 
failure 
mechanisms.

Following the  above  approach,  we  define  effective 
defect density as the number of devices vulnerable to a 
certain  type  of  failure mechanisms  per  unit  area  of  a 
structure,  where 
the 
primitive  physical  element  on  which  the  failure  can 
occur. For instance, for failures due to electromigration 
(EM),  the  effective  defect  density  is  given  by  the 
number  of  vias  per  unit  area  that  have  unidirectional 
current  flow.  Vias  are  the  interconnect  abutments 
between  metal  lines  in  different  layers,  e.g.,  between 
M1 and M2, M2 and M3, and so on. Vias constitute the 
weakest  part  of  metal  lines  [5],  but  not  all  are 
vulnerable  to  EM;  vias  that  experience  bidirectional 
current  flow  are  generally  able  to  recover  from 
deleterious  EM  effects  as  the  movement  of  metal 
atoms in one direction is subsequently balanced by an 
equivalent  movement  of  atoms 
the  opposite 
direction  of  current  flow  [ 6].  Thus,  only  vias  with 
unidirectional current flow are counted in the effective 
defect density for EM failures. Similarly, for NBTI, the 
effective  defect  density  is  given  by  the  number  of 
pFET  devices  per  unit  area  along  the  critical  path  as 
negative  gate  bias  (i.e.,  Vgs  =  -Vdd)  occurs  only  on 
pFET devices in digital circuits to cause increased gate

In  our 
approach, 
impact  of  various 
microarchitecture designs on lifetime reliability can be 
studied rather straightforwardly by parameterizing the 
configurations (e.g., number of entries in register files 
or  arrays,  number  of  ports,  etc.)  and  quantifying 
activity  factors  (e.g.,  number  of  accesses,  number  of 
transitions,  etc.)  as  determined  empirically

through  execution-driven 
simulation  on  applied 
workloads.  From  this,  effective  defect  densities  and 
effective 
failure 
mechanisms  can  be  found,  on  which  the  appropriate 
reliability model can be applied to find the FIT value 
for  the  microarchitecture  designs.  Furthermore,  to 
understand the impact of technology (e.g., scaling) and 
environment  (e.g.,  temperature)  on  lifetime  reliability 
of a given microarchitecture, one need only to estimate 
how  the  FORC  for  a given  failure  mechanism  would 
scale or change and then apply this new FORC value to 
the  architecture-level  FIT  expression  derived  relative 
to the reference circuit.

vulnerable  to  timing  violations  [ 7].    For  TDDB,  the 
effective  defect  density  is  given  by  the  number  of 
pFET and nFET devices per unit area having a leakage 
current through gate oxide exceeding that which can be 
tolerated by the logic driving the devices [8].  
Once  the  effective  defect  density  for  a  certain 
failure mechanism is found for a given structure within 
the microarchitecture, an appropriate reliability model 
can be applied to find the FIT value for that structure 
and failure mechanism. In order not to overestimate the 
FIT value, the effective  stress  condition of the failure 
mechanism  needs  to  be  taken  into  account  for  the 
reliability  model,  as  most  CMOS  devices  experience 
discontinuous  stress 
than  constant  stress 
throughout  their  lifetime.  For  instance,  an  EM  stress 
condition  of  vias  occurs  only  during a  one-to-zero  or 
zero-to-one value transition of metal lines, generating 
current flow through the vias. For NBTI, pFET devices 
are under stress only while their gate is low and their 
source  is  high.  Similarly,  for  TDDB,  pFET  or  nFET 
devices undergo stress condition only while their gate 
is  low  or  high,  and  their  source  is  high  or  low, 
respectively.  We  account  for  this  effective  stress 
condition  using  activity  factor  and/or  duty  cycle  as 
described  in  Section  4.  During  the  time  other  than 
stress  periods,  devices  are  either  recovering  from  or 
unaffected by the failure effects [6,7,9]. In Section 4, 
both  effective  defect  density  and  effective  stress 
condition  for  structures  and  failure  mechanisms  are 
formulated using microarchitectural parameters. 
Chip  lifetime  failure  rate  is  affected  not  only  by 
architectural  factors  such  as  the  number  of  effective 
defects  and  effective  stress  condition  of  various 
microarchitecture 
structures  but  also  by  many 
technological  and  environmental  parameters  that  are 
difficult to abstract for the general case. In particular, 
there  are  implementation  technology  differences  such 
as  device  pitch,  semiconductor  material  (bulk  silicon 
versus SOI), manufacturing process, etc., all of which 
may vary from one chip maker or generation to another 
and  strongly  influence  chip  lifetime.  For  studying

where AEM and n are empirical constants, Eα_EM is the 
activation  energy  for  EM,  k  is  Boltzmann’s  constant, 
and T is absolute temperature in degrees Kelvin. Using 
this  notion  of  FORC,  we  can  express  failure  rates  of 
microarchitectural  components  due  to  EM  in  relative 
terms of FORCEM, as described in Section 4.1, in order 
to  isolate  the  architect  from  low-level  peculiarities

3.2. FORC for NBTI Failures (FORCNBTI) 
Inverters having an NBTI-
affected pFE T device
...
Figure  2.  The  reference  circuit  chosen  for  NBTI.  The 
reference circuit consists of a series of inverters between 
two  latches.  Because  the  value  of  the  signal  changes 
between  Vdd  and  GND  in  passing  through  each  inverter, 
the pFET device in every other inverter is stressed. 
NBTI occurs when the input to a gate is low while 
the  output  is  high,  resulting  in  an  accumulation  of 
positive  charges  at  the  interface  between  gate  oxide 
and  silicon.  This  accumulation  causes  the  threshold 
voltage, VT, of the pFET device to increase over time, 
which results in a slowdown in zero-to-one or one-to-
zero  transitions.  Eventually,  this  can  lead  to  circuit 
failure due to timing violations if the device is along a 
critical  path.  To  capture  this  failure  mechanism,  we 
chose a reference circuit for NBTI that includes pFET 
devices  under  stress  and  limits  allowable  gate  delay 
increase before timing violation occurs.  
As shown in Figure 2, the reference circuit consists 
of  a  series  of  Ninv  inverters  between  two  latches. The 
input  of  one  latch  should  propagate  through  the 
inverter chain and be latched into the other within one 
clock period. Because the value of the signal changes 
between  Vdd  and  GND  in  passing  through  each 
inverter,  the  pFET  device  in  every  other  inverter  is
