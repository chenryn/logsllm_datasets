Select an indented line of text by placing your cursor at the beginning of the
line and pressing the down arrow while holding the shift key. Copy the line
with cmd-c, then immediately paste with cmd-v.
I expect the duplicated line to be pasted with the same indentation as the
previous line, but it's always pasted with leading whitespace removed.
