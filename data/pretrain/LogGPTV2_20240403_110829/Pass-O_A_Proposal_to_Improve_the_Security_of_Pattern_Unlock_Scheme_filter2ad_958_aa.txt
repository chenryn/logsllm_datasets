ABSTRACT
The graphical pattern unlock scheme which requires users
to connect a minimum of 4 nodes on 3X3 grid is one of the
most popular authentication mechanism on mobile devices.
However prior research suggests that users’ pattern choices
are highly biased and hence vulnerable to guessing attacks.
Moreover, 3X3 pattern choices are devoid of features such
as longer stroke lengths, direction changes and intersections
that are considered to be important in preventing shoulder-
surﬁng attacks. We attribute these insecure practices to the
geometry of the grid and its complicated drawing rules which
prevent users from realising the full potential of graphical
passwords.
In this paper, we propose and explore an alternate cir-
cular layout referred to as Pass-O which unlike grid layout
allows connection between any two nodes, thus simplifying
the pattern drawing rules. Consequently, Pass-O produces a
theoretical search space of 9,85,824, almost 2.5 times greater
than 3X3 grid layout. We compare the security of 3X3 and
Pass-O patterns theoretically as well as empirically. Theo-
retically, Pass-O patterns are uniform and have greater vi-
sual complexity due to large number of intersections. To per-
form empirical analysis, we conduct a large-scale web-based
user study and collect more than 1,23,000 patterns from
21,053 users. After examining user-chosen 3X3 and Pass-
O patterns across diﬀerent metrics such as pattern length,
stroke length, start point, end point, repetitions, number
of direction changes and intersections, we ﬁnd that Pass-O
patterns are much more secure than 3X3 patterns.

devices are gateway to sensitive information such as credit
card details, passwords and emails. To prevent unautho-
rised use of mobile devices several authentication mecha-
nisms e.g., textual passwords, numerical passwords (PINs),
graphical passwords and biometrics are available. However,
users perceive 3X3 patterns to be more usable as compared
to textual passwords and PINs [15]. Further, biometric al-
ternatives such as ﬁngerprints are considered to be less se-
cure than PINs, textual passwords and 3X3 patterns [2].
Hence, 3X3 patterns have received wide attention from the
security community.
Although the grid-based pattern unlock scheme is consid-
ered as usable, the recent security studies [6, 13] show that
human-generated graphical patterns are vulnerable to guess-
ing attacks. In particular, users’ pattern choices are highly
biased and only a small fraction of the theoretical pattern
space is actually used. Simple pattern shapes resembling
English letters such as ‘Z’, ‘S’ , ‘L’, ‘N’, ‘M’ are quite pop-
ular among users. Since the 3X3 pattern space is already
limited (3,89,112 combinations), the weak pattern choices
of users make the problem much worse. Increasing the grid
size to 4X4 does not solve this problem as 4X4 patterns are
simply extended versions of popular 3X3 patterns [6].
Yet another threat to the grid-based authentication scheme
comes from shoulder-surﬁng attacks [10, 11]. These attacks
are more likely to succeed since users choose simple pat-
terns [6, 13] containing only horizontal (1 → 2) or vertical
lines (1 → 4) which could be easily memorized by an ob-
server. The features such as longer length, knight moves,
direction changes and intersections which are necessary to
counter shoulder-surﬁng attacks [4,10,11] are mostly absent
in the user-chosen patterns. We attribute these insecure
practices to the grid-based layout and its complex pattern
drawing rules.
The rules are as follows, (a) the pattern should be drawn
using straight lines and without lifting the hand, (b) the
pattern should connect at least 4 nodes and a maximum of
9 nodes, (c) a node cannot be connected more than once,
and (d) an unconnected node cannot be skipped if it lies
along the path of a pattern.
The last rule (d) especially limits the space of 3X3 pat-
terns as it does not allow connectivity between any two
nodes unconditionally. For instance, users cannot connect
1 → 3 in the grid unless the node 2 is already connected
(Figure 1a). In this paper, we develop an intuitive circular
layout which unlike grid layout allows a direct connection be-
tween any two nodes, therefore yielding a theoretical space
of 9,85,824 patterns, 2.5 times greater than 3X3 grid layout

Contributions. In this paper, we compare the security of
3X3 and Pass-O patterns against both guessing attacks and
shoulder-surﬁng attacks. We study them analytically as well
as empirically. Speciﬁcally, our contributions are:
• Theoretical Analysis - We perform theoretical analysis of
all valid 3X3 patterns and Pass-O patterns. We show that
Pass-O layout not only provides a large search space than
grid-based layout but also patterns drawn on Pass-O are
visually more complex in terms of intersections.
• Largest ever Security Study - To estimate the security of
3X3 and Pass-O patterns against guessing and shoulder-
surﬁng attacks, we conduct a large-scale user study and
collect 69,797 3X3 patterns and 53,393 Pass-O patterns
from 21,053 users. To the best of our knowledge this is
the largest patterns study reported till date.
• Resistance to Shoulder-Surﬁng - We compare the security
of 3X3 and Pass-O datasets across diﬀerent metrics such
as repetitions, pattern length, stroke length, start point
distribution, end point distribution, number of direction
changes and intersections. The average length of Pass-O
patterns is 7.46 while for 3x3 patterns it is 6.92. Fur-
ther, the average number of intersections (3.47) in Pass-O
patterns is signiﬁcantly larger than that of 3X3 patterns
(0.63). Thus, as compared to 3X3 patterns, Pass-O pat-
terns are visually more complex and therefore more resis-
tant to shoulder-surﬁng attacks.
• Resistance to Guessing - The large-scale data allow us to
provide a more reliable estimate of guessing resistance of
users’ pattern choices. We ﬁnd that the security of 3X3
patterns is much less than that reported in the litera-
ture [6, 13]. Our Markov model based guessing algorithm
cracked 18.55% of 3X3 patterns but only 11.51% of Pass-O
patterns within ﬁrst 20 guesses. Using the partial guess-
ing entropy metric [8], we ﬁnd that the security of the ﬁrst
10% (G0.1) of 3X3 patterns is just 5.80 bits (less than two
random digits) while the security of Pass-O patterns is
7.06 bits (more than two random digits).
• Top 500 patterns - We also share a list of top 500 3X3 and
Pass-O patterns with the research community [1].
Notations. For convenience, all nodes in 3X3 grid and
Pass-O are labelled from 1 to 9 (Figure 1). Speciﬁcally,
nodes in 3X3 grid are labelled in row-major order, the upper-
left node is labelled as 1 and the bottom-right node is la-
belled as 9. Nodes in Pass-O are labelled in clockwise as-
cending order starting from the top-most node which is la-
belled as 1. A pattern can therefore be represented as an
ordered sequence of nodes, e.g.,12369. We refer to the num-
ber of nodes connected in a pattern as pattern length or
simply length. Thus, the pattern length of 12369 is 5. Pat-
terns can also be viewed as a sequence of line segments. For
instance, the pattern 12369 is composed of 4 line segments,
1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 6 and 6 → 9. The number of line seg-
ments in a l length pattern is simply l − 1. We use symbols
µ for average, σ for standard deviation and ˜x for median.
2. THREAT MODEL
We consider the threat posed to pattern unlock scheme
by guessing as well as shoulder-surﬁng attacks. For more
information about the related work on these attacks, we refer
the reader to appendix A.
2.1 Guessing Attacks
In this threat model, we assume that an attacker is in
possession of the user device (e.g., by theft). Further, we
assume that the attacker has no information about the de-
vice owner nor about the pattern lock. The only information
that the attacker has an access to is the sorted list of most
commonly used patterns. The attacker can make a maxi-
mum of 20 failed attempts before the device is deactivated
and rendered useless [6]. Therefore, immediately after ac-
quiring the device, the attacker draws the ﬁrst 20 patterns
from the sorted pattern list to authenticate.
2.2 Shoulder-surﬁng Attacks
We quote the shoulder-surﬁng threat model as described
in [14] verbatim. A user draws the pattern in a (semi-)public
setting. The attacker, who has no previous knowledge about
the characteristics (e.g., length) of the drawn pattern, has
perfect sight on the display. There are no occlusions and
no distracting reﬂections. The attacker sees the whole au-
thentication exactly once as there is no technical equipment
involved (e.g., video recording). Immediately after the at-
tack, the observer gets in possession of the device (e.g., by
theft) and redraws the observed pattern to authenticate.
3. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
To perform theoretical analysis, we wrote a recursive pro-
cedure that generates all valid 3X3 and Pass-O patterns. In
addition, the procedure also calculates and stores the charac-
teristics of all valid patterns. We focus on the characteristics
such as node reachability, size of the search space, pattern
length, stroke length and number of intersections.
Reachability. Figure 2 shows the reachability of nodes in
both layouts. We classify all nodes in 3X3 grid into three
categories, namely corner nodes, center node and side nodes.
As the name suggests, a corner node is the one located at the
corner of the grid {1,3,7,9}. The node 5 located at the center
is a center node and the remaining nodes located along the
boundary of the grid {2,4,6,8} are referred to as side nodes.
A corner node can be connected to 5 other nodes uncondi-
tionally and to the remaining 3 nodes conditionally only if
the intermediate node along the path is already visited. For
instance, the line segment 1 → 3 is possible only if the node
2 is already visited. Similarly, a side node can be connected
unconditionally to seven other nodes. The only node in this
grid that can be connected to other eight nodes is the center
node whereas in Pass-O any node can be connected to the
remaining eight nodes.

(b) Side
Total Space. Due to limited reachability of corner and side
nodes, 3X3 grid oﬀers only a limited space of 3,89,112 pat-
terns. On the other hand, in Pass-O since every node can be
connected to every other node, the total number of l length
patterns can be easily computed using the formula 9P l.
401Theorem 1. In a Pass-O with n nodes, the size of the
theoretical space is (cid:98)n! · e − 1(cid:99).
If n = 9, the size of the theoretical space is (cid:98)9! · e − 1(cid:99) =
(cid:98)9!· 2.71828− 1(cid:99) = 986, 409. This enumeration also includes
patterns with length 1, 2 and 3, excluding these the size of
the search space is 985,824.
Pattern length. The length of a pattern is simply the
number of nodes connected to form that pattern. It is anal-
ogous to the length of a textual password and is one of the
most important features in determining the pattern security.
Theorem 2. In a Pass-O with n nodes, the average pat-
tern length µn is n − 1.
Thus, the average pattern length in the 9-node Pass-O is
9 − 1 = 8. This also matches with the average µnode = 8 as
computed by our program (Table 1). The length statisitcs
of theoretical 3X3 and Pass-O patterns are quite similar.
Stroke Length. Not every line segment in a pattern has
same length. For instance, in both grid and circular lay-
outs, the line segment 1 → 6 is longer than the line segment
1 → 2. This distance notion is captured using the stroke
length of a pattern, which is deﬁned as the sum of Euclidean
distances of all line segments that forms the given pattern.
To compute the stroke length of 3X3 patterns, we label the
upper-left node as (0,0) and the lower-right node as (2,2).
Thus, the length of horizontal and vertical line segments
connecting adjacent nodes is just 1 and the length of diago-
nal segments can be easily computed using the Pythagoras
theorem.

8 = 2.828, knight move of length
We categorize all line segments in 3X3 grid into ﬁve moves,
straight move (horizontal or vertical) of length 1, short di-
2 = 1.414, long diagonal move of
agonal move of length
length
5 = 2.236 and
overlapping move of length 2. A straight move connects a
node to its adjacent neighbours, 1 → 2 and 1 → 4. A diag-
onal move connects a node to its diagonally adjacent neigh-
bour 1 → 5 while a long diagonal move connects two diag-
onally opposite corners of the grid 1 → 9. A knight move
connects non-adjacent nodes with a diagonal line 1 → 6
and 1 → 8, an overlapping move also connects two non-
adjacent nodes but with a straight line 1 → 3 and 1 → 7. All
ﬁve moves are possible (conditionally) only from the corner
nodes {1,3,7,9}. The side nodes {2,4,6,8} allow all but long
diagonal moves while the center node 5 allows only straight
and short diagonal moves (Figure 2).
To compute the stroke length of Pass-O patterns, we as-
sume that the Pass-O circle is inscribed in 3X3 grid. If the
grid ﬁts on a mobile screen then, the inscribed circle also
ﬁts on the same screen. Thus, the radius of the nine nodes
Pass-O inscribed in 3X3 grid is 1. We observe that every
line segment in a Pass-O pattern is a chord in the unit cir-
cle and its length can be calculated using the formula, r · θ,
where θ is the angle formed between two radii connecting
the two ends of the chord. Therefore, from a given node
x, there are 2 nodes {x+1, x-1} at a distance of 0.684 , 2
nodes {x+2, x-2} at 1.286, 2 nodes {x+3, x-3} at 1.732 and
2 nodes {x+4, x-4} at 1.970. Note that, we have penalized
the stroke lengths in Pass-O by assuming its radius to be of
unit length. Thus, the average stroke length of 3X3 patterns
(11.02) is longer than Pass-O patterns (9.93).
