User: Maybe I'm being irrational but I really really hate it when a command opens a new window in emacs.  I'm using emacs on Ubuntu which came with python-mode and when I start an interpreter with C-c ! it pops up in a new window.
What I want is for emacs to switch to a new buffer in the same window.  So far I've tried adding Jython(I set the interpreter to jython) to same-window-buffer-names and even going into python-mode.el and changing switch-to-buffer-other-window calls to switch-to-buffer(which I since changed back).  So far I've gotten no change.
I have emacs 23.1.1 and python-mode 5.1.0
Edit: The actual name of the jython buffer is bracketed by asterisks and I don't know how to let stackoverflow know that they aren't styling information.
Assistant: I use python-mode 5.2.0.
I went into python-mode.el and changed the switch-to-buffer-other-window to switch-to-buffer.
I evaluated it and now the interpreter opens up in the same window (regardless of the number of other windows I have).
Did you evaluate the function when you changed the above line?
Btw, opening the interpreter in another window is a feature, not a bug, IMHO. We want to be able to see the interpreter when we evaluate a region of code using C-c | or the buffer using C-c C-c.
