ABSTRACT
Research on smart meters has shown that ﬁne-grained en-
ergy usage data poses privacy risks since it allows inferences
about activities inside homes. While smart meter deploy-
ments are very limited, more than 40 million meters in the
United States have been equipped with Automatic Meter
Reading (AMR) technology over the past decades. AMR
utilizes wireless communication for remotely collecting us-
age data from electricity, gas, and water meters. Yet to the
best of our knowledge, AMR has so far received no atten-
tion from the security research community. In this paper,
we conduct a security and privacy analysis of this technol-
ogy. Based on our reverse engineering and experimentation,
we ﬁnd that the technology lacks basic security measures to
ensure privacy, integrity, and authenticity of the data. More-
over, the AMR meters we examined continuously broadcast
their energy usage data over insecure wireless links every 30s,
even though these broadcasts can only be received when a
truck from the utility company passes by. We show how this
design allows any individual to monitor energy usage from
hundreds of homes in a neighborhood with modest techni-
cal eﬀort and how this data allows identifying unoccupied
residences or people’s routines. To cope with the issues, we
recommend security remedies, including a solution based on
defensive jamming that may be easier to deploy than up-
grading the meters themselves.

INTRODUCTION
Much attention has been devoted to smart meters, as they
play a central role in transforming the current electrical grid
to the smart grid. The smart grid promises to improve
the eﬃciency and reliability of existing grids by adding self-
monitoring, self-diagnosis, demand-response, and communi-
cation capabilities. Privacy advocates have, however, im-
mediately cautioned that ﬁne-grained energy consumption
data collected by smart meters could reveal sensitive per-
sonal information from homes, and have protested against
the adoption of smart meters [1, 2, 3]. Researchers have
already identiﬁed several speciﬁc types of information that
can be derived from this energy data and pointed to as-
sociated privacy risks. For instance, burglars could moni-
tor the power consumption of several households to identify
temporarily vacant homes and time their break-ins [4]; a
nosy landlord, employer, or even a stalker could estimate the
number of residents in a household based on the frequency
of power switches turned and the number of appliances si-
multaneously in use [4]; one could monitor the location of
a resident inside the home based on the type of appliances
being used [5]; health insurers could track eating, sleeping,
and to some extent exercise habits by monitoring household
appliance usage [6, 7]. Suﬃciently ﬁne-grained data even
allows identifying the TV channel or movies being watched
since television power consumption changes with the image
being displayed [8]. Such snooping into personal residences
is often viewed as particularly intrusive since the home is
one of the last bastions of privacy. It is the locus that ﬁrst
gave rise to the concept of privacy laws [9] and a place where
a particularly strong expectation of privacy still exists.
There are also security concerns that arise in smart me-
ters, particularly about the integrity and authenticity of
the reported data. Although smart meters have been de-
signed to mitigate the long-standing problem of energy theft
via physical tampering, their wireless module is known to
present ample opportunity for dishonesty. For instance, it
allows underreporting energy usage or inﬂating the utility
bills of a neighbor [10, 7]. To ensure the trustworthiness of
the meter data, NIST is developing guidelines for cryptog-
raphy and key management strategies in smart meters [11].
Because of the on-going privacy debate and the yet-to-be-
veriﬁed security strategies, smart meters have so far only
undergone a few pilot deployments in the United States.
1.1 Automatic Meter Reading
There is, however, another enhanced meter technology
that has already been widely deployed but has so far re-
462ceived little attention. As of 2010, more than 47 million
of these Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) systems were in-
stalled, representing more than one-third of the 144 mil-
lion total U.S. residential, commercial, and industrial me-
ters [12]. Once deployed, AMR meters will likely remain in
operation for an extended period of time for several reasons.
First, AMR systems enable utility companies to remotely
collect consumption data of electricity, water, and gas —
for example, with a receiver mounted on a drive-by truck.
They therefore promise to reduce the cost of reading me-
ters as well as reduce human errors in this process. Second,
we have witnessed attempts to leverage the existing invest-
ments in AMR meters [13] to provide some of the functions
of smart meters. For instance, existing ﬁxed network AMR
can report energy consumption data to both customers and
providers in real time by connecting AMR meters to a net-
work of radio repeaters and collectors [14], allowing utilities
to better respond to demand changes (demand-response).
Motivated by this large existing deployment, in this pa-
per we report a privacy and security analysis of a popular
AMR meter system. Using a software radio platform we re-
verse engineered the wireless communication protocol and
examined whether any of the above mentioned privacy and
security risks associated with smart meters also exist in the
AMR systems. We were also curious whether the consid-
erable smart meter security research and public discussion
have inﬂuenced the design of such systems.
1.2 Contributions and Findings
The step from traditional analog meters to AMR may
seem like a minor technology upgrade compared to the en-
visioned smart meters, thus appearing unlikely to result in
signiﬁcant privacy and security issues. We found, however,
that the risks are compounded due to the following reasons.
Unsecured Wireless Transmission. Smart meter re-
search typically assumes that energy data is communicated
to the utility over a secure channel to preserve the integrity
of the readings and alleviate privacy risks [15, 11, 7, 16].
Thus, privacy risks of smart meters center on insider risks,
misuse, and exploitation of the data at the utilities. The
AMR meters that we studied, however, make data publicly
available over unsecured wireless transmissions. They use
a basic frequency hopping wireless communication protocol
and show no evidence of attempting to ensure conﬁdential-
ity, integrity, and authenticity of the data. The communi-
cation protocol can be reverse engineered with only a few
days of eﬀort and software radio equipment that is publicly
available for about $1,000 (GNU Radio with the Universal
Software Radio Peripheral). We were able to both eavesdrop
on messages as well as spoof messages to falsify the reading
captured by a commonly used ‘walk-by’ reader.
Continuous Broadcast of Fine-Grained Energy Data.
The meter we examined continuously broadcasts its energy
consumption, even if no receiver is present. Approximately
once a month, the meter is being read by a utility truck that
drives by. However, the meter simply broadcasts its reading
every 30s around the clock. We also found the communi-
cation range of AMR meters to be larger than expected.
Packets from gas meters and electric meters can be success-
fully received from up to 70m and 300m, respectively, using
a generic 5 dBi antenna and an oﬀ-the-shelf low noise ampli-
ﬁer (LNA). In the neighborhood where we tested, we were
able to receive packets from 106 electric meters using a basic
antenna and 485 meters by adding an LNA at a single meter
location.
Neighborhood Monitoring. AMR meters make it pos-
sible for anybody with suﬃcient technical skills to monitor
real-time energy consumption patterns in an entire neigh-
borhood. We built a live RF sniﬀer that collects energy
consumption records by eavesdropping on the periodic wire-
less packets. Compared with the more ﬁne-grained data
obtained from direct visual observation, we found that the
data obtained by RF sniﬃng is still suﬃcient to identify the
same appliance usage events. It can therefore be helpful in
inferring residents’ daily routines. This is particularly con-
cerning because wireless eavesdropping facilitates the moni-
toring of hundreds of residences in neighborhood from a sin-
gle location with a lower risk of detection than direct visual
observation of the residences.
Defenses for Legacy AMR Meters. We recommended
several remedies to alleviate these risks on legacy meters.
They range from policies such as occasional manual cross-
checking of the readings to ensure integrity, over meter up-
grades with cryptographic protocols, to a defensive jamming
solution that can be implemented by adding a simple hard-
ware component next to an existing meter.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present
a background overview of AMR in Section 2. In Section 3,
we describe our reverse engineering endeavor to discover de-
tails of the proprietary communication protocol, and show
spooﬁng attacks. We then reveal our ﬁnding on using AMR
meters to monitor energy usage in a neighborhood in Sec-
tion 4 and to identify people’s routines in Section 5.
In
Section 6, we recommend security remedies. Finally, we
survey the related work in Section 7 and conclude the paper
in Section 8.
2. BACKGROUND
Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) is a technology that au-
tonomously collects the consumption and status data from
utility meters (e.g., electric, gas, or water meters) and deliv-
ers the data to utility providers for billing or analysis pur-
poses. The concept of AMR was proposed in the 1960s [17],
and the ﬁrst AMR design was documented in a patent by
Paraskevakos in 1972 [18]. This early version of an AMR
system used telephone lines to automatically transmit me-
ter readings to a remote receiver. Later versions of AMR
adopted power line communication,
low power radio fre-
quency (RF) communication, satellite communication, etc.
Among these technologies, RF communication is the most
cost-eﬀective solution and has been widely used in residen-
tial AMR systems. In this paper, we focus on AMR systems
that utilize RF communication.
2.1 AMR Architecture
AMR systems consist of two main components: (1) AMR
Meters that collect and transmit consumption data, and (2)
AMR Readers that receive and forward the consumption
data sent by meters to a central collection point for billing,
diagnosis, and analysis.
AMR Meters. AMR meters (hereafter meters) measure
the total consumption of electricity, gas, or water. Regard-
less of what meters are measuring, their core components re-
main the same. Each RF-based meter is comprised of a me-
tering engine and an Encoder-Receiver-Transmitter (ERT).
The metering engine measures the consumption through a

to be inapplicable to the models of meters that we studied
and some proving to be pertinent. We learned that most
meters operate in the 915-MHz ISM band, use simple mod-
ulation schemes such as on-oﬀ keying (OOK) or frequency
shift keying (FSK), and incorporate Manchester encoding
schemes. To avoid packet collision, meters implement fre-
quency hopping, where packet transmissions repeatedly cy-
cle through a pre-determined sequence of channels. Each
packet contains the meter ID, reading, device type, and tam-
pering status.
AMR systems support two types of communication mod-
els: ‘wake-up’ and ‘bubble-up’. Wake-up systems use two-
way communication, whereby a reader transmits an activa-
tion signal to wake up and interrogate one or more meters.
Bubble-up models use one-way communication, whereby me-
ters periodically broadcast the meter readings. Wake-up
models are primarily used in battery-operated gas and water
meters, while bubble-up models are used mainly in electric
meters [14]. Interestingly, we discovered that the gas meter
that we investigated also works in bubble-up fashion.
3. SECURITY ANALYSIS OF AMR METERS
Besides the eﬀort of detecting physical meter tampering,
we have found no evidence that security was considered dur-
ing the AMR meter design. Since the wide deployment of
AMR meters, there has been sporadic exploration into sys-
tem characteristics [21, 10]. However, none of the previous
work has taken a comprehensive look at the deployed system
to determine how an attacker might misuse it.
In this section, we investigate the following issues: (1)
How easy is it to reverse-engineer the communication pro-
tocol? (2) Are spooﬁng attacks possible?
3.1 Equipment
The primary purpose of our work is to raise awareness
about oft-neglected areas, not to encourage misuse; hence,
we have refrained from disclosing details of the meters being
studied. For our study, we used the equipment from the
following three categories.
AMR Meters. We selected electric and gas meters that
have been widely deployed throughout the United States.
In addition to meters installed in our neighborhood, we ac-
quired second-hand electric and gas meters to conduct ex-
periments both in the lab and outdoor.
Meter Readers. We obtained a generic handheld AMR
ERT module reader used by meter inspectors for ﬁeld in-
terrogation. This handheld AMR reader works with the
selected meters and can read the meter ID, meter reading,
meter type, and physical tamper status. In our experiments,
we primarily used it for interpreting meter packets. We did
manage to brieﬂy access (1 hour) advanced AMR collec-
tors used by utility companies to test our spooﬁng attacks.

mechanical dial that rotates at a speed proportional to the
amount of consumption. With the help of electromechani-
cal or electro-optical interfaces, the movements of dials are
converted into digital numbers. The ERT consists of a mi-
croprocessor and a low-power radio transmitter. It processes
the meter reading and periodically reports information such
as meter ID, meter reading, tamper status, etc.
Depending on what meters are measuring, their appear-
ances, communication protocols, and power supplies can dif-
fer. Fig. 1 shows two representative residential gas meters
and an electric meter. Electric meters are conveniently pow-
ered by the main electricity supply line, while gas and water
meters operate on sealed batteries designed to last up to 20
years [14]. The battery constraints of gas and water meters
usually lead to longer intervals between energy reports. We
