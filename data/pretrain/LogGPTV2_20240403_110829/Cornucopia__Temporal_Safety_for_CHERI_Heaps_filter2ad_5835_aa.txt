### Abstract:
Cornucopia is a novel system designed to enhance the temporal safety of CHERI (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions) heaps. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Cornucopia, which aims to prevent temporal memory safety vulnerabilities in CHERI-based systems. By leveraging the capabilities of CHERI, Cornuctopia ensures that memory accesses are both spatially and temporally safe, thereby mitigating a wide range of security threats.

### Introduction:
Temporal safety is a critical aspect of secure software, particularly in systems that manage dynamic memory. Traditional memory management techniques often fail to address temporal safety, leading to vulnerabilities such as use-after-free and double-free errors. CHERI, with its capability-based architecture, provides a strong foundation for enhancing memory safety. However, ensuring temporal safety remains a challenge. Cornucopia addresses this gap by introducing mechanisms that enforce temporal safety in CHERI heaps, thereby providing a robust defense against temporal memory safety vulnerabilities.

### Contributions:
1. **Design of Cornucopia**: We present the design of Cornucopia, which integrates temporal safety into CHERI heaps.
2. **Implementation**: We describe the implementation details, including the integration with existing CHERI systems.
3. **Evaluation**: We evaluate the performance and security benefits of Cornucopia through a series of experiments and case studies.
4. **Case Studies**: We provide real-world examples where Cornucopia successfully mitigates temporal memory safety vulnerabilities.

### Conclusion:
Cornucopia represents a significant step forward in ensuring the temporal safety of CHERI heaps. By combining the strengths of CHERI's capability-based architecture with novel temporal safety mechanisms, Cornucopia provides a robust solution for preventing temporal memory safety vulnerabilities. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of Cornucopia in enhancing the security of CHERI-based systems, making it a valuable addition to the field of secure computing.
