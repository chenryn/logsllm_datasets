values of the property concerned. For example, we can specify that the class
“department” has at the most 30 members:
OWL 11
30
owl:minCardinality: Defines the set of individuals that have at least N distinct
values of the property concerned. For example, a course must be taught at least by one
teacher. In OWL it is defined as follows:
1
owl:cardinality: Defines the set of individuals that have an exact number of distinct
values of the property concerned. This element is used to specify a precise number, i.e.
to express that a property has a minimum cardinality which is equal to the maximum
cardinality.
Properties’ Characteristics
Properties’ characteristics add more expressivity to the OWL language.
owl:equivalentProperty and owl:inverseOf elements are examples of those
characteristics. The owl:equivalentProperty element associate properties that have the
same range and the same domain. For example, the property “leacturesIn” is equivalent
to “teaches” and in OWL this can be represented as:
The owl:inverseOf element can be used to define inverse relation between properties.
If property P’ is stated to be the inverse of property P’’, then if X’’ is related to Y’’ by
the P’’ property, then Y’’ is related to X’’ by the P’ property. For example, “teacher
teaches a course” is the inverse of “a course is taught by a teacher”. This can be
expressed in OWL as:
The property element has some properties that can be defined directly:
• Function property – The function property (owl:FunctionProperty) defines a
property that has at the most one value for each instance.
12 OWL - Web Ontology Language
• InverseFuncionalProperty – In OWL, by using the InverseFuncionalProperty
(owl:InverseFuncionalProperty) it is possible to define properties that have different
values to different instances, i.e. two different instances can not have the same
values.
• Transitive property – The transitive property is understood as: if the pair (x, y) is an
instance of the transitive property P, and the pair (y, z) is an instance of P, we can
infer the pair (x, z) is also an instance of P.
• Symmetric property – The symmetric property (owl:SymmetricProperty) is
interpreted as follows: if the pair (x, y) is an instance of A, then the pair (y, x) is also
an instance of A.
The following example illustrate the application of the owl:SymmetricProperty and
owl:TransitiveProperty elements.
FUTURE TRENDS
Many researchers worldwide have recognized that the Semantic Web (or Web3.0) is
the key to develop the new generation of information systems. The number of
international conferences organized every year on this topic clearly shows the interest
and importance of this new technology. In this context, OWL is the most widespread
language to develop a new breed of the Semantic Web-based applications. OWL has
been used in many areas; some applications and tools use this conceptual approach to
build Semantic Web based systems. According to TopQuadrant (TopQuadrant 2005), a
consulting firm that specializes in Semantic Web technologies, the market for semantic
technologies will grow at an annual growth rate of between 60% and 70% until 2010
In the near future, we will see the use of OWL to implement applications raging
from semantic social networking, semantic RSS, semantic podcasts, semantic wikis,
semantic blogs to semantic mashups. As you can see, we will be devising a solution that
matches most of executives’ future product acquisitions strategies. Adding semantics to
these types of applications is important since in a survey of 8,300 executives from
McKinsey it was found that when asked about their plans to invest in tools in the future,
the answers given included those applications.
Enterprise Information Integration (EII) is another area that will benefit from the
Semantic Web and OWL. Today, integration is a top priority for many European and
worldwide enterprises. Most organizations have already realized that the use of
Semantic Web technologies (Berners-Lee, Hendler et al. 2001) is the best solution to
support cross-organizational cooperation for SMEs that operate in dynamically
changing work environments. Semantic Web technologies are already viewed as a key
technology to resolve the problems of interoperability and integration within the
heterogeneous world of ubiquitously interconnected systems with respect to the nature
of components, standards, data formats, protocols, etc. Moreover, we also believe that
Semantic Web technologies can facilitate not only the discovery of heterogeneous
components and data integration, but also the communication, coordination and
OWL 13
collaboration behavioral of employees and individuals. Semantics can help not only the
system, but also human integration and interoperability.
Managing information in enterprises faces three barriers that have to be overcome:
the diverse data formats, the disparate nature of content and the need to drive
“intelligence” from this content. The Semantic Web helps to surpass these limitations
by providing a way to add semantic metadata to documents. Metadata allows software
programs to automatically understand the full context and meaning of each document.
So it is accurate to say that semantics will enable information integration and analyses
in the following tasks:
• Extracting, organizing and standardizing information from many disparate and
heterogeneous content sources and formats.
• Identifying interesting and relevant knowledge from heterogeneous sources and
formats.
• Making efficient use of the extracted knowledge and content by providing tools that
enables fast and high-quality querying, browsing and analysis of relevant and
actionable information.
Finally, programming the Semantic Web with OWL can reduce and eliminate
terminological and conceptual confusion by defining a shared understanding, that is, a
unifying framework enabling communication and cooperation amongst people in
reaching a better inter-enterprise organization. Presently, one of the most important
roles ontology plays in communication is that it provides unambiguous definitions for
terms used in a software system, but semantics needs to be applied rapidly to human
integration to enable communication, coordination, and cooperation. The use of
ontologies for improving communication has already been shown to work in practice.
CONCLUSIONS
The Semantic Web is the future vision of the current Web, where information will
have a precise meaning. Currently, the WWW is primarily composed of documents
written in a language (HTML) that is useful for visual presentation, but not for
computerized understanding. The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension
of the current one, in which information is a given well-defined meaning, enabling
computers and people to work better in cooperation. To make possible the creation of
the Semantic Web it is important to have a language that: (1) describes the concepts of a
given domain and (2) creates ontologies. One of the most prominent ontology languages
to achieve those two tasks is OWL (Ontology Web Language) which can be used to
develop Semantic Web applications. These applications will constitute a new wave of
enhanced systems that will understand better the domain in which they are working and
with which they interact. OWL defines a common set of terms that are used to describe
and represent a specific domain. Thus, standard OWL enables the Web to be a global
infrastructure for sharing both documents and data, which makes searching and reusing
information easier and more reliable as well. OWL can be used by applications to
improve search engines on the Web and tools to manage knowledge. In this chapter we
have laid out the foundations of the Semantic Web, its associated languages and
standards. These elements are the basic building blocks of any Semantic Web
application.

OWL 15
TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
Metadata – Metadata is data that describe other data. Generally, a set of metadata
describes a single set of data, called a resource.
Ontology – Is a description of concepts and relationships that can be used by people
or software agents that want to share information within a domain. An ontology
document defines the terms used to describe and represent a domain.
OWL – Is a markup language for publishing and sharing data using ontologies on
the Internet. OWL is a vocabulary extension of the RDF and is derived from the
DAML+OIL Web Ontology Language.
RDF – Resource Description Framework is a family of World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) specifications originally designed as a metadata model using XML
but which has come to be used as a general method of modeling knowledge, through a
variety of syntax formats.
RDFS – RDF Schema is an extensible knowledge representation language,
providing basic elements for the definition of ontologies, otherwise called RDF
vocabularies, intended to structure RDF resources.
Semantic Web – The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data
to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and community boundaries. It
is a collaborative effort led by W3C with the participation of a large number of
researchers and industrial partners.
XML – The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text
format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). XML is accepted as a standard for data
interchanged on the Web, allowing for the structuring of data but without meaning.
