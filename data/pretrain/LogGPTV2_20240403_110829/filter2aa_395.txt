**Presenters:**

#### Who Are We?

#### Overview
This presentation discusses files that can trigger outbound traffic when parsed, even if they are not in an executable format. This behavior can occur regardless of the file's complexity and without the use of exploits. We will also explore the implications of this behavior.

#### What Is This Talk About?
- **Privacy:**
  - Digital Rights Management (DRM)
  - Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
  - De-anonymization
- **Security:**
  - NTLM credential capture/relay
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **"It’s a Feature, Not a Bug"**

#### Why Is This Important?
Understanding how seemingly benign files can initiate network traffic is crucial for maintaining privacy and security. These files can be used to track users, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious activities.

#### Demonstration
- **RTF (Rich Text Format)**
- **WMV (Windows Media Video)**
- **Office Formats:**
  - .docx
  - .pptx
  - .xlsx
- **PLS Playlists**
- **Shortcut (.lnk) Files**
- **Desktop.ini Files**
- **HTML**

#### Known Formats That Allow This Behavior
- **HTML in Internet Explorer**
- **Linked Images in Emails Opened in Outlook**

#### Other NTLM Trigger Scenarios
- **Document Formats**
- **Media Formats**
- **Meeting/Scheduling Related Formats**

#### Focus of Our Work
- **Remote Image:**
  - No warning, no NTLM
- **App.media.openPlayer():**
  - Warning, NTLM possible
- **getURL():**
  - Warning, NTLM possible

#### PDF
- **Linked Document on UNC Share:**
  - Warning (often ignored), NTLM possible

#### RTF
- **Remote XML Stylesheets**
- **JavaScript**

#### SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- All these formats support remote media, including UNC paths.

#### M3U / PLS / ASX
- **ID3 Tag:**
  - LINK frame
  - APIC frame
- **Not supported on any major player we tested.**

#### MP3
- **URLANDEXIT:**
  - Launches the default browser with a specified URL
- **DRM Functionality Abuse**
- **Subtitles:**
  - Can include arbitrary HTML

#### ASF (WMA/WMV/ASF)
- **HTTP Tracker URLs in "announce-list":**
  - As many as you want
- **URL Seeds Allowed in "url-list":**
  - Clients can implement any URL handler
- **Must Support One or Both of HTTP and FTP:**
  - Not universally supported

#### TORRENT
- **Free/Busy URL:**
  - No warning, NTLM possible
  - Requires specific actions by the recipient

#### VCF (vCard Format)
- **VALARM:**
  - ATTACH parameter is a URL
  - AUDIO and PROCEDURE alarm types

#### ICS (iCalendar Format)
- **Not Even Calendar.app Will Let You Accept PROCEDURE!**

#### Delivery Methods
- **Email**
- **Open File Share**
- **Watering Hole**
- **P2P Distribution**
- **Honeypot**

#### Dystopian Future DRM
- **Could Call Home:**
  - Probably already does in some cases
- **Goes Beyond Deterrence into Identification**

#### Digital Rights Management
- **Imagine Being a Whistleblower in a Fascist Country:**
  - The document you exfiltrate calls home from various locations, leading to your disappearance.

#### Data Loss Prevention
- **Tor Browser Only Routes Browser Traffic Through Tor:**
  - External programs don’t route through Tor
  - You don’t control that jihad wiki, but maybe you can upload a bugged PDF

#### De-anonymization
- **Windows Will Auto-Auth When Accessing SMB:**
  - Files can initiate SMB traffic
  - Embedding remote file:// resources
  - UNC path as a file
  - JavaScript/other active content
  - NTLM auth can be cracked or relayed

#### NTLM Credential Capture/Relay
- **NTLM Overview:**
  - Server
  - Client
  - 1. Negotiate
  - 2. Challenge
  - 3. Authenticate
- **NTLM Relay Overview:**
  - Server
  - Client
  - Attacker
  - Initiating traffic from privileged positions is fun:
    - Exploit router vulnerabilities
    - Exploit NAS/Printers
    - Exploit IoT devices

#### CSRF
- **Antivirus?**
  - Too many formats and variations
  - Possibility of false positives
- **Format Changes?**
  - Too much inertia, too many formats
- **Application-Level Firewalls?**
  - Easy for RTF
  - Not so easy for M3U

#### Possible Mitigations
- **Warnings?**
- **Proxychains with strict_chain and bad proxy:**
  - Doesn’t work for some applications
- **Egress Filtering:**
  - Doesn’t stop internal connections
  - Might stop legitimate functionality
