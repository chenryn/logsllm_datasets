Question: In developing a new web application, the security team is debating the merits of keeping the source code private versus making it open source. Based on Shannon's Maxim and related security principles, what should be the primary focus to ensure the security of the application?
"A": "Ensuring that the source code remains private to prevent attackers from discovering potential vulnerabilities.",
"B": "Focusing on the design of robust security measures that do not depend on the secrecy of the source code.",
"C": "Using obscure and less known programming languages to reduce the likelihood of an attacker being familiar with potential exploits.",
"D": "Designing the system to require frequent changes to the source code, making it harder for attackers to maintain up-to-date knowledge."
Answer: B
