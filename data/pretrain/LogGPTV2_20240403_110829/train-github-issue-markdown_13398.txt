Hi,
I'm building some experiment with chrome canary and everything is fine. But
when I tried with chrome 20.0.1132.57 I was surprised to have something like 1
frame per second. Commenting the texture.needsUpdate made everything run again
at a comfortable 60fps so I created a jsfiddle to make sure this is what was
causing the slowdown.
The jsfiddle confirmed that it was this line which was causing the problem,
but I find it strange that is has so much impact. Firefox too doesn't seem to
like the needsUpdate flag.

You can simply set the first line to true to enable the needsUpdate. On my
machine this cause the framerate to go from 60fps to 9fps.
Is there anything wrong with my code? Any idea if maybe the next three.js
release would help in this scenario?
