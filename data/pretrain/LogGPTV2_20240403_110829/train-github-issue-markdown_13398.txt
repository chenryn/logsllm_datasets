Hello,

I have been conducting an experiment using Chrome Canary, and everything has been working smoothly. However, when I tested the same experiment with Chrome version 20.0.1132.57, I encountered a significant performance issue, with the frame rate dropping to approximately 1 frame per second. 

Upon further investigation, I discovered that commenting out the `texture.needsUpdate` line resolved the issue, restoring the frame rate to a comfortable 60 frames per second. To confirm my findings, I created a [JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/sDUZ5/3/) to isolate the problem.

In the JSFiddle, you can enable the `needsUpdate` flag by setting the first line to `true`. On my machine, this change causes the frame rate to drop from 60fps to 9fps. Additionally, it appears that Firefox also experiences performance issues when the `needsUpdate` flag is enabled.

Is there any possibility that my code might be causing this issue? Furthermore, do you think that a future release of three.js could potentially address this problem?

Thank you for your assistance.
