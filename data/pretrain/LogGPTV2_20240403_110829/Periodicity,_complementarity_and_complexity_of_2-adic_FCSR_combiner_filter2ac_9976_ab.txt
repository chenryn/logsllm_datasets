be the binary expansion of q + 1, where r = log2(q + 1)
and qi ∈ {0, 1}. Then the 2-adic FCSR with connection
integer q has r stages and feedback connection coeﬃcients
(also referred to as tap coeﬃcients or taps) given by the bits
{q1, q2, . . . , qr} of equation (9). This is shown in ﬁgure 3.
By letting q0 = −1, we may write

Let the contents of the main shift register cells be denoted
by an−1, an−2, . . . , an−r ∈ {0, 1} and let the initial memory
be denoted by mn−1 ∈ Z. The contents of the main shift
register and the contents of the memory register together
represent the state of the FCSR. With reference to ﬁgure 3,
the operation of the 2-adic FCSR is given by iterating the
following steps:
A1. Form the integer sum σn = Pr
mn−1.
k=0 qkan−k +
A2. Shift contents one step to the right, output
the rightmost bit an−r.
A3. Place an = σn mod q into the leftmost cell
of the shift register.
A4. Replace the memory integer mn−1 with mn =
(σn − an)/2 = σn/2.

The FCSR sequence is thus the unique solution to the
with-carry linear recurrence
an + 2mn = q1an−1 + q2an−2 + · · · + qran−r + mn−1 (11)
for n ≥ r. In solving the recurrence (11), we ﬁrst compute
the right hand side as an integer σn ∈ Z, then obtain an by
reducing σn modulo 2, and then compute the new memory
mn as  σn
2 . There are three alternative ways in which such
an FCSR sequence may be described. First, it is the output
of an FCSR with r main register cells, tap coeﬃcients given
by the qis and the initial state given by the ais and mr−1.
The output sequence of the FCSR is obtained by iterating
steps A1–A4. The connection integer of this FCSR is given
by equation (10). Secondly, it is the coeﬃcient sequence of
the 2-adic expansion of the rational number
p

where the numerator is given by

Thirdly, FCSR sequences also possess an exponential repre-
sentation in which the general term may be written as
an = (aδn
(mod q))
(mod 2)
(14)
where δ = 2−1 (mod q) and a ∈ Z/(q) is an element that
depends upon the initial state.
In the right hand side of
equation (14), the quantity aδn is ﬁrst reduced modulo q
and represented as an integer in the range {0, 1, . . . , q − 1}
and then this integer is reduced modulo 2.
It is clear that the connection integer q of an FCSR de-
pends only upon the tap coeﬃcients, and that for a ﬁxed q,
the numerator in equation (12) is dependent only upon the
register contents and the memory. Thus in equations (12)
and (13), p represents the state of the FCSR. Properties of
the FCSR such as period and distribution properties of the
output are independent of the state of the FCSR and are de-
termined by q alone. The equations (12), (13) and (14) also
show how the state changes due to one iteration of steps A1–
A4. In every iteration, q remains ﬁxed, but as the contents
of the register change, p cycles through the diﬀerent states of
the FCSR. The change of state due to one iteration of steps
A1–A4 is given by the following relation: if p is the current
state, the next state is simply δp (mod q). This follows from
the exponential representation of an FCSR sequence.
1.3 Properties of 2-adic FCSR Sequences
Let Z2 denote the ring of 2-adic integers. The following
facts are known about the 2-adic FCSR:
1. (Klapper and Goresky [13]) If a sequence a = (ai)i≥0
is the output of a 2-adic FCSR with odd connection
integer q, then a is eventually periodic and is the 2-
adic expansion of a rational number α = p/q ∈ Z2.
Conversely, every eventually periodic binary sequence
can be associated with a 2-adic integer α = p/q ∈ Z2,
where q is odd, and the sequence is the output of a 2-
adic FCSR with connection integer q. Thus there is a
one-to-one correspondence between rational numbers
p/q with q odd and eventually periodic sequences gen-
erated by a 2-adic FCSR. Every 2-adic FCSR is com-
pletely characterised by the rational number whose 2-
adic expansion coincides with the output of the FCSR.
2. (Klapper and Goresky [13]) If α = p/q ∈ Z2 is the
2-adic number associated with the output sequence of
a 2-adic FCSR, then the sequence is strictly periodic
if and only if −q  0 and such that
2 is a primitive root modulo q1 and q2. Let a := (ai)i≥0 and
b := (bi)i≥0 be two strictly periodic binary sequences gen-
erated by 2-adic FCSRs with connection integers q1 and q2,
respectively. Let T1 = (r1 − 1)re1−1
and T2 = (r2 − 1)re2−1
be the periods of the two sequences a and b respectively and
let L = lcm(T1, T2). Let c := (ci)i≥0 := a ⊕ b := (ai ⊕ bi)i≥0
be the output sequence obtained by computing the element-
wise exclusive-OR of a and b. Let T be the period of the
sequence c and let −p/q be the rational number in lowest
terms, whose 2-adic expansion coincides with the sequence
c.

3. MAIN RESULTS
Before we proceed to discuss the main theorems, we need
a couple of useful lemmas. The ﬁrst of these is a well-known
fact that can be easily derived from the results in any intro-
ductory textbook on number theory such as, for example,
from Theorem 95 of Hardy and Wright [11]. We include the
proof of Lemma 1 here for the sake of completeness.
Lemma 1. Let q = re be a power of an odd prime r such
that 2 is a primitive root modulo q. Then r is of the form
4k ± 1 where k is odd.
Proof. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose r = 4k±1
where k is even. Then r = 4k ± 1 = 8k ± 1 for some
integer k. Consider the quadratic character of 2 modulo q.
We know from Euler’s criterion on quadratic residues that
p ) = 2ϕ(p)/2 ≡ ±1 mod p for any prime p, where the sign
( 2
is taken according as p ≡ ±1 (mod 8) or p ≡ ±3 (mod 8),
and where ϕ denotes Euler’s totient function. Since r =
8k ± 1, this implies that 2ϕ(r)/2 ≡ +1 (mod r) and that
2 is a quadratic residue modulo r. Therefore 2 is also a
quadratic residue modulo q and 2ϕ(q)/2 ≡ +1 (mod q). But
this contradicts the fact that if 2 is a primitive root modulo
q then 2i ≡ +1 (mod q) for no i < ϕ(q). Hence k cannot be
even.
Lemma 2. Let q1 = re1
be two powers of
odd primes r1 and r2 such that 2 is a primitive root modulo
q1 and q2. Let T1 = (r1 − 1)re1−1
and
let L = lcm(T1, T2).

i. If r1 ≡ r2 (mod 4) and if r1 = 4k1 +1 and r2 = 4k2 −1,
then L/T1 is odd and L/T2 is even.
ii. If r1 ≡ r2 (mod 4), then both L/T1 and L/T2 are odd.
Proof. (i.) We have
L = lcm(T1, T2) = T1T2/ gcd(T1, T2).
Therefore,
L/T2 =

gcd(T1, T2)

2k1(4k1 + 1)e1−1
gcd(2k1(4k1 + 1)e1−1, (2k2 − 1)(4k2 − 1)e2−1)
This is clearly an even number since the denominator is
odd and therefore divides k1(4k1 + 1)e1−1 (by Lemma 1).
By similar arguments, L/T1 can also be seen to be an odd
number.
(ii.) We can prove this for both r1 ≡ r2 ≡ 1 (mod 4) and
r1 ≡ r2 ≡ −1 (mod 4) by using Lemma 1 in an argument
similar to the one above.
Case 1. r1 ≡ r2 ≡ +1 (mod 4)
L/T1 =

gcd(T1, T2)
4k2(4k2 + 1)e2−1

k2(4k2 + 1)e2−1
gcd(k1(4k1 + 1)e2−1, k2(4k2 + 1)e2−1)
.

=
This is odd since k1 and k2 are both odd by Lemma 1.
Similarly, L/T2 is also odd.
Case 2. r1 ≡ r2 ≡ −1 (mod 4)
L/T1 =
T2
gcd(T1, T2)
(4k2 − 2)(4k2 − 2)e2−1

(2k2 − 1)(4k2 − 2)e2−1
gcd((2k1 − 1)(4k1 − 2)e2−1, (2k2 − 1)(4k2 − 2)e2−1)
.
=
=
This is clearly again an odd number. Similarly, we can prove
that L/T2 is also odd.
Under the same assumptions as in Lemma 2, consider the
expression (T1 − T2) (mod 4). Without loss of generality,
assume that r1 = 4k1 + 1 and r2 = 4k2 − 1. Then,
