User: I am using Python2.6. I am trying to list the disk drives that a system may have. 
On Windows, it may be something like C:/, D:/, E:/, etc. On Linux, it may be something like /boot, /media/SDCard, etc. And I don't know what it's like on a Mac. Maybe something under /Volumes.
Does anyone know of a cross platform way (that is, one which works on Linux, Windows and Mac) in Python?
Thanks!
Assistant: I don't see a way in psutil to include net mounts on Windows. I.e., \foobar\home is mapped to X:, but X: does not appear in the list returned by psutil.disk_partitions() (local drives are).
Update:  To include net drives in the returned list, simply use:
psutil.disk_partitions(all=True)
Works quite well.
