User: I installed Python 2.7.6 Windows Installer (Windows binary) and then, I was trying to install the extension pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe. But everytime I run this extension, I get the issue of "pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe has stopped working".
Assistant: You should run the exe file as "Administrator". 
Even if you are in the administrator account, you have to explicitly run it with administrator permission by right clicking on the exe.
