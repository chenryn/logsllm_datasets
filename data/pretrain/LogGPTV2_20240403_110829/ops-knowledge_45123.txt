I have installed Python 2.7.6 using the Windows Installer (Windows binary). Subsequently, I attempted to install the `pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe` extension. However, each time I run the installer, I encounter an error message stating, "pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe has stopped working."

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, you should run the `.exe` file with elevated permissions, even if you are logged in as an administrator. To do this, right-click on the `pywin32-218.win-amd64-py2.7.exe` file and select "Run as administrator." This will grant the necessary permissions to complete the installation process successfully.
