User: I was wondering if it was possible to play a sound directly into a input from python. I am using linux, and with that I am using OSS, ALSA, and Pulseaudio
Assistant: I guess it depends on what you would like to do with it after you got it "into" python.
I would definitely look at the scikits.audiolab library. That's what you might use if you wanted to draw up spectrograms of what ever sound you are trying process (I'm guessing that's what you want to do?).
