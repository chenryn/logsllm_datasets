Subject: Memory Leak Issue with Large GIF Image Loading

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently experiencing a memory leak issue in my application when attempting to load a large GIF image using Glide. Below is the stack trace, and I have also provided the relevant code snippet for your reference.

### Stack Trace
```

```

### Code Snippet
```java
Glide.with(this)
    .load("https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7489/15428306664_6903c2f82d_o.gif")
    .into(img);
```

### Heap Dump
You can find the heap dump file [here]([Link to the heap dump file]).

### Issue Description
From the stack trace, it appears that my application is running out of memory when trying to decode and load a large GIF image. Despite the garbage collector freeing up memory, the allocation size required for the GIF exceeds the available heap space, leading to an `OutOfMemoryError`.

### Request for Assistance
I would greatly appreciate your help in identifying and resolving the root cause of this memory leak. Any insights or suggestions on how to handle large GIF images more efficiently would be highly valued.

Thank you for your time and assistance.
