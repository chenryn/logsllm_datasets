User: What methodology does the continuous improvement of the IT shared service center follow?
Assistant: In order to adapt to changes in the external environment, changes in internal requirements, etc., IT shared service centers need continuous improvement, and continuous improvement generally follows a long-established and effective method, the most common being PDCA. The PDCA cycle was first proposed by Walter A. Shewhart and carried forward by Deming, so it is also called the Deming cycle. PDCA represents the initials of four words, namely Plan (plan), Do (execution), Check (check) and Act (processing). 路 Plan (plan): Identify the improvement goals of the IT shared service center, target identification follows the SMART principle, and formulate an improvement plan based on the identified goals. 路 Do (execution): Formulate specific and feasible improvement plans, and implement the improved content according to the plans. 路 Check (check): Check the results of the improvement and evaluate the effect of the improvement. 路 Act (processing): Summarize the experience and lessons learned in the improvement process of the IT shared service center, and start the next round of improvement iterations for unfinished items or new improvement goals.
