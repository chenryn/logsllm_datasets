 **Glide Version** :4.0.0 RC0
**Integration libraries** :No
**Issue details / Repro steps / Use case background** : I have just added the
glide dependency in my gradle file. When I try to use methods like
placeholder(), centerCrop(), crossFade(), etc. between load() and into(), it
gives me syntax error like there is no such method. Are they removed in this
release or am I missing something ?
**Glide load line /`GlideModule` (if any) / list Adapter code (if any)**:
    Glide.with(this)
                            .load(imgUrl)
                            .placeholder(R.drawable.downloading)
                            .into(bikeImageView);
It gives error on placeholder() that the method doesn't exist.
