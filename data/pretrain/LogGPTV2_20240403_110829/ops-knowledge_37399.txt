GitHub Pros: - Complete version control and collaboration features - Supports code highlighting and syntax highlighting - Provides public warehouses for open source projects Cons: - Higher fees for private developers - Large teams You need to build your own Git service 4. GitLab Advantages: -Similar to GitHub, it has complete version control and collaboration functions -Support code highlighting and syntax highlighting -You can build your own service Disadvantages: -Compared with GitHub, the function is not as good, and the number of users is small -Requires cumbersome operation and maintenance 5. Bitbucket Advantages: -Complete version control and collaboration functions -Supports code highlighting and syntax highlighting -For small teams, a free account is enough Disadvantages: -Compared with GitHub, the number of users is small- The number of paid applications is relatively small.
