To effectively implement CIS Control 3.5, which focuses on securely disposing of data, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Develop a Data Disposal Policy**: Establish a clear and comprehensive policy that outlines the procedures for securely disposing of data. This policy should be part of the organizationâ€™s broader data management process.

2. **Classify Data Sensitivity**: Identify and classify the sensitivity of the data to determine the appropriate disposal methods. Different types of data (e.g., personally identifiable information, financial records, intellectual property) may require different levels of security and specific disposal techniques.

3. **Select Appropriate Disposal Methods**: Choose disposal methods that are commensurate with the data's sensitivity. Common methods include:
   - **Physical Destruction**: For physical media, such as hard drives, use degaussing, shredding, or incineration.
   - **Digital Sanitization**: For digital data, use secure erasure software, cryptographic erasure, or multiple-pass overwriting to ensure data is irretrievable.

4. **Implement Secure Disposal Processes**: Ensure that the disposal processes are followed consistently and securely. This includes:
   - **Training Employees**: Educate employees on the importance of data disposal and the proper methods to use.
   - **Document Procedures**: Maintain detailed records of the disposal process, including the date, method, and personnel involved.
   - **Audit and Monitor**: Regularly audit and monitor the disposal processes to ensure compliance and identify any potential vulnerabilities.

5. **Compliance and Legal Requirements**: Ensure that the data disposal practices comply with all relevant legal, regulatory, and industry standards. This may include requirements from laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or other industry-specific regulations.

By following these procedures, organizations can ensure that they are effectively implementing CIS Control 3.5, thereby protecting sensitive data and reducing the risk of data breaches.
