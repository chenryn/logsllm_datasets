Hello everyone,  
I have experienced a very unusual bug that I never saw before. When I run this
codes, I got logout from MacOS and return to login page!
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from astropy.visualization import astropy_mpl_style
    from astropy.utils.data import get_pkg_data_filename
    from astropy.io import fits
    from astropy.wcs import WCS
    hdu = fits.open('file.fits')[0]
    wcs = WCS(hdu.header)
    plt.subplot(projection=wcs)
    plt.figure()
    plt.imshow(hdu.data, cmap='gray')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()
This bugs only happens when I keep
    plt.show()
I also saw this bugs today by installing DS9 8.0.1 Aqua port (not X11 port).
When I tried to open DS9, it just logout from my client and return to login
page.
I guess it's far beyond matplotlib, Maybe comes from X11?
Is there any solution?  
Thanks!
