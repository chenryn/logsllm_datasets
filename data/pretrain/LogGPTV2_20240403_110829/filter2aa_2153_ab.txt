### Analysis of CVE-2017-8464 and CVE-2019-1188

#### CVE-2017-8464 - Stuxnet 3.0
- **HasLinkTargetIDList Flag**: This flag is set, indicating that the LNK file contains a `LinkTargetIDList`.
- **LinkTargetIDList**:
  - The `LinkTargetIDList` contains three `ItemIDs`:
    - **IDList[0]**: Root Folder with the CLSID of "My Computer".
    - **IDList[1]**: Root Folder with the CLSID of "Control Panel".
    - **IDList[2]**: Malformed `IDList` to load `exp.dll`.

- **SpecialFolderDataBlock**:
  - Contains a `SpecialFolderDataBlock` with `SpecialFolderID = 3` (CSIDL_CONTROLS).

- **Fuzzing Strategy**:
  - Use CVE-2017-8464 as the corpus.
  - Focus on mutating `LinkFlags`, `LinkTargetIDList`, and `SpecialFolderDataBlock`.

- **Fuzzing Steps**:
  - Write the fuzzing harness.
  - Prepare the corpus by collecting different LNK files, creating them manually, and using test cases from GitHub and old CVE PoCs.
  - Run the fuzzer and check code coverage with tools like drcov, lighthouse, and IDA Pro.
  - Use interesting test cases as new seeds.
  - Reverse engineer the target to assist the fuzzer.

- **Initial Fuzzing Results**:
  - Found a crash after a few hours of fuzzing.

#### CVE-2019-1188 - Heap Overflow in CInternetFolder::ParseDisplayName
- **Vulnerability Description**:
  - A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `CInternetFolder::ParseDisplayName` method.
  - The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a URI that is not a valid file path, such as `"A|"`.

- **Exploit Details**:
  - The `ParseDisplayName` method attempts to convert the provided URI into an item identifier list.
  - If the URI is not a valid file path, it allocates a small buffer and validates it with `_EnsureIUri`.
  - The buffer size is calculated based on the length of the provided URI, which in this case is 6 bytes (`wcslen("AI") * 2 + 2`).
  - The `IURLQualifyWithContext` function then combines the URL with the current directory and converts it to a full URL, leading to a heap overflow if the buffer is too small.

- **Mitigation**:
  - The caller must provide a buffer larger than 2084 bytes to avoid the overflow.
  - This is an ancient bug that has existed since at least Windows 2000.

#### SpecialFolderDataBlock and CSIDL
- **SpecialFolderDataBlock**:
  - Used to identify special folders in a system-independent way.
  - The `SpecialFolderID` field specifies the type of special folder, such as `CSIDL_INTERNET` (Internet Explorer) or `CSIDL_CONTROLS` (Control Panel).

- **CSIDL Definitions**:
  - CSIDL (Constant Special Item ID List) provides a way to refer to special folders without hardcoding paths.
  - Examples include `CSIDL_DESKTOP` (Desktop), `CSIDL_PROGRAMS` (Start Menu\Programs), and `CSIDL_PERSONAL` (My Documents).

- **Usage**:
  - By assigning different `CSIDL` values in the `SpecialFolderID`, you can call the `ParseDisplayName` method of various interfaces, such as `CControlPanelFolder` for `CSIDL_CONTROLS` and `CInternetFolder` for `CSIDL_INTERNET`.

- **CSIDL Constants**:
  - A list of common `CSIDL` constants is provided, each corresponding to a specific system folder.

By understanding these vulnerabilities and the structure of LNK files, security researchers can develop more effective fuzzing strategies and exploit mitigations.
