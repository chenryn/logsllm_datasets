# Diversity and Hard Targets in Cybersecurity

## Introduction to Hard Targets
- **Definition of Hard Targets:**
  - Large corporations
  - Banking and financial services
  - Air traffic control systems
  - NIPRNET (Non-Classified Internet Protocol Router Network)

- **Characteristics of Hard Targets:**
  - Employ multiple security mechanisms
  - Segmented network regions
  - Dedicated security teams

- **Botnet Size and Hard Targets:**
  - Botnet size figures suggest that even hard targets are not immune to attacks.

## Attacking Hard Targets
- **Approach:**
  - Requires a dedicated and patient attack, similar to advanced penetration testing.
  
- **Step-by-Step Process:**
  1. **Gain a Foothold:**
     - Research the target network and its users.
     - Track victims using GSM information (SOURCE: Boston talk).
     - Examine social networks of users.
     - Obtain inside help, infiltrate, or buy access.
     - Send emails with malware or links to zero-day exploits.
     - Leverage control over trusted nodes via the botnet.

- **Further Steps:**
  - Record keystrokes, sniff packets, map the network, and analyze intranet services.
  - Slowly take over the entire local network.
  - Learn how changes are made, monitor intranet sites and emails, and crack all passwords.
  - Use client-side attacks and observe VPN and SSH usage.
  - Install Remote Access Trojans (RATs) on systems, using different RATs for different hard targets.
  - Become an "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT).

## Core Infrastructure Targets
- **Targets:**
  - Core routers
  - DNS servers

- **Attacks:**
  - Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
  - Poisoning routing tables
  - Gaining access via a "hard target" approach
  - DOS attacks against vulnerabilities in routers and servers (e.g., Cisco IOS, JunOS, BIND, MS DNS)

## Air-Gapped Systems
- **Definition:**
  - The most secure systems are "air-gapped" from the internet, meaning they are physically isolated.
  - Examples include:
    - DOD TS//SI network
    - Electric power grid
    - Air traffic control systems

- **Challenges:**
  - These systems can still be remotely attacked, but it is difficult.
  - Example: JWICS was compromised by a USB drive.

- **Un-Airgapping:**
  - The easiest solution is to reintegrate these networks back onto the internet.
  - Alternatively, an operative can install a 3G modem and a RAT on a computer/device on the network.
  - Other methods include adding a new device to the network, using a satellite phone, or a modem over existing phone lines if TEMPEST shielding is a problem.

## Cyberwar Defenses
- **Defensive Actions:**
  - Segregation (disconnect from the internet)
  - Deployment of large-scale Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
  - Akamai-like DDoS protection for critical systems
  - Airgap sensitive networks
  - Isolate from the internet to protect against foreign attacks
  - Install aggressive filters on inbound foreign traffic

- **Filtering:**
  - Target country may use filtering on internet traffic.
  - IDS, IPS, etc.
  - Custom-written botnet clients and communications to avoid signature detection.
  - Redundancy ensures that if one bot or RAT is detected, the attack can continue from the remaining ones.

- **Akamai-like Defenses:**
  - Akamai works by mirroring and caching content in multiple, physically diverse locations.
  - Delivers content close to the requester.
  - Target countries may use Akamai or develop similar approaches to stop DDoS attacks against critical infrastructure.
  - Our botnet is physically diverse, with many nodes close to each Akamai server, and should be large enough to overwhelm even distributed services.

- **Air-Gapped Systems:**
  - Target country may physically separate critical infrastructure (utilities, financial networks, military systems).
  - Some systems cannot be air-gapped (e.g., e-commerce).
  - In advance, we try to un-airgap the systems we target.

## The Cyberarmy
- **Job Roles:**
  - Vulnerability Analysts
  - Exploit Developers
  - Bot Collectors
  - Bot Maintainers
  - Operators
  - Remote Personnel
  - Developers
  - Testers
  - Technical Consultants
  - Sysadmins
  - Managers

- **Role Descriptions:**
  - **Vulnerability Analysts:**
    - Bug hunters who find vulnerabilities in software via fuzzing and static analysis.
    - Need to be world-class talent, difficult to "grow."
    - Find bugs in client-side applications, servers, networking equipment, and smart phones.
    - Focus on exploitable or DoS bugs.

  - **Exploit Developers:**
    - Turn vulnerabilities into highly reliable exploits.
    - Develop exploits for both zero-day and known vulnerabilities.
    - Requires significant skill to defeat anti-exploitation measures like ASLR, DEP, and sandboxing.

  - **Bot Collectors:**
    - Use client-side exploits to take over and install bots on as many computers and devices as possible.
    - Deliver exploits via spam, advertising banners, and malware.
    - Maintain and monitor exploit servers.

  - **Bot Maintainers:**
    - Monitor the size and health of botnets, including geographic diversity.
    - Test botnets and make efforts to maintain them by keeping systems patched and removing other malware.

  - **Operators:**
    - Actively exploit hard targets (elite pen testers).
    - Use advanced exploits, mostly zero-day.
    - Understand the entire target network and perform passive and active scanning.
    - Install RATs, monitor keystrokes, and expand reach in the network.

  - **Remote Personnel:**
    - Set up operations around the world.
    - Get jobs and access to air-gapped systems.
    - Install, monitor, and test un-airgapping devices.

  - **Developers:**
    - Develop a variety of bots and RATs with differing communication methods.
    - Develop tools to aid other personnel.
    - Require user and kernel-level development on various platforms.

  - **Testers:**
    - Test exploits, RATs, and bots for functionality and reliability.
    - Ensure stealth against anti-virus, IDS, and IPS.

  - **Technical Consultants:**
    - Experts in domain-specific and obscure hardware and software systems.
    - SCADA engineers, medical device experts, aviation scheduling experts, etc.

  - **Sysadmins:**
    - Keep systems running and updated.
    - Install software, clients, and target software.
    - Manage test networks and systems.

- **Cost Considerations:**
  - Only factor in hardware, software, and personnel salaries.
  - Exclude building rent, utilities, travel, and support staff (electricians, janitors, guards).

- **Conclusion:**
  - Building a cyberarmy requires a well-coordinated team of skilled professionals and significant resources.
