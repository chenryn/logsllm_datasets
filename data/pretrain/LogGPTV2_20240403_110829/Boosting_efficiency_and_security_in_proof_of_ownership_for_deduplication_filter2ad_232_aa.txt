## Abstract
Deduplication is a technique used to reduce the storage requirements of service providers by storing only a single copy of identical files. While conceptually simple, implementing deduplication introduces several security risks. This paper addresses one of the most significant risks: an adversary claiming ownership of a file with only partial knowledge or through collusion with a rightful owner. Our contributions include:

1. A novel Proof of Ownership (POW) scheme that matches the features of state-of-the-art solutions while significantly reducing overhead.
2. The security of our proposed mechanisms is based on information-theoretical (combinatorial) assumptions rather than computational ones.
3. We introduce optimization techniques that further enhance the performance of our scheme.
4. Extensive benchmarking supports the quality and efficiency of our proposal.

## 1. Introduction
The rapid growth of cloud services has led to a significant reduction in storage costs and an increase in the number of customers. Popular providers like Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Dropbox, and Memopal have made storage a commodity. Key factors contributing to low prices include multitenancy, distributed algorithms, and efficient use of storage through compression and deduplication.

### Deduplication
Deduplication avoids storing the same data multiple times by leveraging the high redundancy in large datasets. Examples include common email attachments, financial records, and popular media content. There are four deduplication strategies, depending on whether it occurs at the client or server side, and at the block or file level. Client-side deduplication is particularly beneficial as it saves both upload bandwidth and storage costs.

### Security Threats to Deduplication
Harnik et al. [10] identified several threats to storage systems using client-side deduplication. These include:
- **Privacy and Confidentiality Attacks:** An attacker can check if another user has uploaded a specific file, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- **Covert Channel Attacks:** Two users can use the storage system to exchange information covertly.
- **Content Distribution Network Abuse:** Users can turn the storage system into a content distribution network by sharing a single copy of a file and distributing the deduplication token.

### Proof of Ownership (POW)
To mitigate these threats, the concept of Proof of Ownership (POW) was introduced [9]. POW schemes ensure that a client truly owns a file, preventing malicious clients from gaining access even if they know a portion of the file. Halevi et al. [9] presented the first practical cryptographic protocol for POW, but it suffers from high I/O and computational requirements, making it impractical for widespread adoption.

### Contributions
In this paper, we present a novel POW scheme that:
- Reduces I/O and computational costs independent of the file size.
- Is highly efficient across a wide range of system parameters.
- Provides information-theoretical security.
- Requires the server to maintain a per-file state that is a negligible fraction of the file size.

### State-of-the-Art Solution
Halevi et al. [9] presented three POW schemes involving Merkle trees and different preprocessing methods:
- **First Scheme:** Uses erasure coding.
- **Second Scheme:** Uses universal hashing.
- **Third Scheme (b-POW):** Uses mixing and reduction phases to hash the file into a reduction buffer.

### System Model
The system consists of a client (C) and a server (S). C uploads files to S, which attempts to minimize bandwidth and optimize storage through deduplication. S has a large back-end storage and a smaller front-end storage for per-file information. C has limited computational and I/O resources, and the design aims to minimize client-side overhead.

### Adversarial Model
- **Server (S):** Trusted entity following the protocol.
- **Client (C):** Potentially malicious, aiming to convince S of owning a file without full knowledge of it.

## 3. System and Security Models
### System Model
- **Principals:** Client (C) and Server (S).
- **Network Connectivity:** Both C and S are connected.
- **Storage:** S has large back-end and small front-end storage.
- **Deduplication:** S checks if a file has been uploaded before to avoid redundant storage.

### Security Model
- **Trusted Server (S):** Follows the protocol correctly.
- **Malicious Client (C):** Tries to claim ownership of a file with partial knowledge.
- **Fraction of File Known:** An input parameter for the security analysis.

This structured approach ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the presentation of the research.
