User: I am purely a windows programmer and spend all my time hacking VC++. 
Recently I have been heading several web based applications and myself built applications with python (/pylons framework) and doing projects on rails. All the web projects are hosted on ubuntu linux.
The RELEASE procedures and check list  we followed for building and releasing VC++ windows application are merely no more useful when it comes to script based language.
So we don't built any binaries now. I copied asp/php files into IIS folder through ftp server when using open source cms applications.
So FTP is the one of the way to host the files to the web server. Now we feel  lazy or not so passionate to copy files via ftp instead we use the SVN checkout and we simply do svn update to get the latest copy.
Is SVN checkout and svn update are the right methods to update the latest build files into the server? Are there any downside in using svn update?  Any better method to release the script/web based scripts into the production server? 
PS: I have used ssh server at some extension on linux platform.
Assistant: One downside of doing an svn update:  though you can go back in time, to what revision do you go back to?  You have to look it up.  svn update pseudo-deployments work much cleaner if you use tags - in that case you'd be doing an svn switch to a different tag, not an svn update on the same branch or the trunk.
You want to tag your software with the version number something like 1.1.4 , and then have a simple script to zip it up application-1.1.4,zip, and deploy it - then you have automated repeatable releases and rollbacks as well as greater visibility into what is changing between releases.
