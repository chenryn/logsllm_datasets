### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### This issue exists in the latest npm version
  * I am using the latest npm
### Current Behavior
Create this package in an empty directory:
    {
      "name": "missing-fs-extra",
      "private": true,
      "description": "A simple package to reproduce missing dependencies when installing with the --production flag",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "gatsby": "^4.4.0"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@storybook/react": "^6.4.9"
      },
      "license": "MIT",
      "scripts": {
        "build": "gatsby build"
      }
    }
Then attempt to run:
    npm install --production && npm run build
Notice how `fs-extra` which is a direct dependency of `gatsby` is missing from
the installed node-modules. `fs-extra` is also a direct dependency (with a
mismatched version) of `@storybook/react`, however `@storybook/react` is a
`devDependency` so my understanding is that it should be ignored completely
when installing with the `--production` flag.
### Expected Behavior
`fs-extra` should be installed in `node_modules` because it is a direct
dependency of `gatsby` which is a direct dependency of the root package.
### Steps To Reproduce
  1. Using `npm` version 8.3.0
  2. With this package:
    {
      "name": "missing-fs-extra",
      "private": true,
      "description": "A simple package to reproduce missing dependencies when installing with the --production flag",
      "version": "0.1.0",
      "dependencies": {
        "gatsby": "^4.4.0"
      },
      "devDependencies": {
        "@storybook/react": "^6.4.9"
      },
      "license": "MIT",
      "scripts": {
        "build": "gatsby build"
      }
    }
  3. Run `npm install --production`
  4. Notice the `fs-extra` module is missing from the installed modules, and when gatsby runs (`npm run build`) it fails to resolve the dependency.
### Environment
  * npm: 8.3.0
  * Node: v14.18.2
  * OS: MacOS Catalina 10.15.7 (19H1615)
  * platform: MacbookPro
