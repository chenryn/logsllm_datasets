towards information weapons.  Second, that there is a growing dependency on civilians and 
civilian objects when conducting warfare.  Based on those two paradigms, Brown concludes that 
“[t]he square peg of conventional [law of war] does not fit neatly into the round hole of [cyber 
and] information warfare,” and he therefore proposes an “International Convention To Regulate 
the Use of Information Systems in Armed Conflict.”  Brown goes on to state that this proposed 
body of law governing Cyber Warfare should be based on the current law of war, including the 
principles of Part III above, but not so much that the essence of Cyber and Information Warfare 
is crippled.  Following the conclusion, Brown presents a Draft Convention Regulating the Use of 
Information Systems in Armed Conflict (the “Draft Convention”).81  In the Draft Convention, 
Brown fails to propose anything new under the current rules of war.  For example, in Article 1,

Brown defines several terms, which are already well-defined in the international, technology, 
and cyber warfare communities.  In Article 3, Brown simply proposes that the current law of war 
be applied to information systems, stating that “[a]n act that violates the law of armed conflict if 
carried out by conventional means also violates the law of armed conflict if carried out by an 
information attack. An attack that does not violate the law of armed conflict if carried out by 
conventional means also does not violate the law of armed conflict if carried out using 
information systems.”82  Articles 4-17 merely implements the principles of distinction, balancing 
military necessity with humanity, and proportionality discussed supra.  The remainder of the 
Draft Convention goes on to specify how the rules of warfare should be implemented in the 
context of cyber warfare.  Brown, in the Draft Convention, failed to present any novel laws; he 
simply took the current rules of war and demonstrated how they already apply to cyber warfare.  
V. Arguments Against Creating a Distinct Body of and International Treaty for Cyber 
Warfare Law. 
Major Eric Jensen contends that the traditional laws of war actually compliment a 
commander‟s ability to conduct Cyber Warfare.83  Jensen argues that the law of war 
accommodates a commander‟s use of CNA in that the commander only needs to determine “if, in 
good faith, he believes that the damage to civilian objects, and injury to civilians that is expected 
from the attack, given the circumstances as known to him at the time . . .  is not excessive to the 
concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.”84  Jensen concludes that “the legal standard 
82 Id.

84 Id. 
when considering potential unexpected consequences is no different in CNO than in normal 
kinetic operations and presents no significant addition to the standard targeting analysis.”85  
In addition to the reasons cited by Major Jensen, this paper also asserts that the traditional 
laws of war are able to handle the unique issues that arise as a result of conducting cyber 
warfare.  The current UN Charter and Laws of War should, therefore, continue to govern cyber 
warfare.  In fact, creating an international treaty or law for cyber warfare would do more harm 
than good and seriously cripple our ability to conduct war.86  In particular, the U.S. should not 
support an international treaty or law for cyber warfare because:  (1) combatant commanders 
already have proper guidelines for conducting warfare; even in the information age;87 (2) fields 
of law are seldom demarcated by technology;  (3) an unintended consequence of a cyber warfare 
law is that it may pose an undue limitation on a primarily non-lethal strategic deterrence; (4) our 
adversaries are unlikely to comply; and (5)  the rate of technology growth will outpace the ability 
for an international cyber regime to produce responsive policy, while the flexibility allotted by 
the UN Charter  and laws of war are able to absorb technological advances. 
A. Fields of Law are Seldom Demarcated by Technology 
Joseph Sommer argued against the creation of a distinct body of “Cyberlaw,” asserting 
that:  (1) cyberlaw is not a body of law in and of itself as technologies generally do not define 
bodies of law, (2) it is dangerous to consider Cyberlaw as its own body of law and that to do so 
will lead to the development of bad law, and (3) most legal issues posed by these technologies 
are not new at all and that existing law is flexible enough to deal with such issues.  In doing so, 
Sommer highlights the facts that there was never a law of the steam engine despite its role in 
85 Id. 
86 See e.g. infra Part V.C. 
87 See supra Part III; see also supra Part IV.A. 
society, nor is there really a law of the car today. Sommer concludes that the new informatics 
technologies do not support any discrete body of social practice, and therefore, Cyberlaw will not 
survive any longer than “the law of the Telephone” or “Space Law.”88  Although this argument 
has failed to gain traction in mainstream society, due to the fact that technology has driven 
changes in several areas of the law, Sommers‟ argument directly lends itself to the debate on the 
limited issue of whether there should be an international treaty or distinct body of cyber warfare 
law.89  Similar to Sommers‟ argument, as it relates to warfare, there was not a law created for 
semi-automatic rifles or tanks, which were arguably more revolutionary to warfare than the 
computer.  This is the exact reason why the Hague Rules of Aerial Warfare, crafted in the 
aftermath of the first use of aircraft in armed conflict, is a dead letter.90  Similarly, other treaties 
were created due to hype instead of necessity, such as the treaty banning the use of 
environmental modification techniques in warfare,91 the protocol banning weapons whose 
fragments cannot be detected by X-ray,92 and the protocol banning the use of blinding lasers.93  
In each of the above situations, there was a new and exciting technology, and in a knee-jerk 
reaction, the international community responded with an unnecessary treaty.  As it relates to 
cyber warfare, the lessons of the past must be considered.  Furthermore, as shown supra, the 
current laws of war adequately addresses cyber warfare.94  For example, prior to armed conflict,

94 See supra Part III. 
there is a general prohibition against uses of force,95 and during armed conflict, the principles of 
distinction, balancing military necessity with humanity, and proportionality must with be used.96 
Therefore, the current rules of war, prior to, and during hostility, encompass cyber warfare.  In 
light of past lessons learned, and the fact that the current rules of war adequately addresses cyber 
warfare, the advent of cyber weapons or capabilities should not cause the warfare laws to be 
rewritten.  
B. Undue Limitations on a Primarily Non-Lethal Strategic Deterrence 
A strategic deterrence is generally defined as the actions of a state or group of states to 
dissuade a potential adversary from initiating an attack or conflict by the threat of retaliation by 
credibly demonstrating to an adversary that the costs of an attack would be too great and would 
outweigh any potential gains.97  A popular example of a strategic deterrence is the mutually 
assured nuclear destruction that would occur should two opposing sides deploy a nuclear 
weapon; each opposing side is, therefore “deterred” from using their nuclear weapon.98  
Although cyber capabilities are unlikely to cause the same amount of devastation as nuclear 
weapons, they commonly serve as deterrents.  For example, one nation state may not conduct a 
cyber attack due to the possibility of mutual destruction that may occur if the aggrieved nation 
responds with a cyber attack of its own.  
An unintended consequence of a Cyber Warfare treaty is that it may pose an undue 
limitation on a primarily non-lethal strategic deterrence.  Despite the many doomsday scenarios 
such as a nuclear power plant being hacked and causing a nuclear explosion, a “Cyber-Katrina”

is unlikely.99  In fact, cyber warfare is unlikely to cause the loss of human life.  It can be argued 
that cyber warfare is a primarily non-lethal strategic deterrence.100  For example, “China‟s 
interest in achieving military effects via cyber warfare begins with deterrence.  The goal is not to 
deter other nations from conducting cyber warfare against the PRC; rather, it is to use the threat 
of cyber warfare to deter an actor from behaving in a manner that is in opposition to Chinese 
strategic interests.”101  To this day, no human being has died as a result of a cyber attack.102  
Although cyber warfare is primarily non-lethal, a CNA is capable of causing physical harm.  One 
can imagine such scenarios such as a CNA causing airplane crashes, due to cyber attacks on air 
traffic control systems, or a nuclear explosion, due to cyber attacks on a nuclear power plant‟s 
SCADA system.  However, these scenarios are unlikely.103  Furthermore, as discussed supra, 
these acts would likely violate the current rules of war.104  Because cyber warfare is primarily 
non-lethal, and due to its deterrence capability, it may be the greater of two evils when it is 
compared to traditional kinetic weaponry such as missiles.  In light of the UN Charter‟s guiding 
principle of preserving human life, proponents of the creation of a cyber warfare treaty should 
consider the fact that such a treaty may have the effect of limiting a primarily non-lethal weapon, 
and possibly shift the weaponry trend back to the use of kinetic weapons. 
C. Our Real Adversaries are Unlikely to Comply with a Cyber Treaty 
Our adversaries are primarily non-state sponsored.  In fact, the phrase “War on Terror” 
was used to denote a global military, political, legal and ideological struggle against

organizations designated as terrorist and regimes that were accused of having a connection to 
them, with a particular focus on militant Islamists and al-Qaeda.  A terrorist organization like 
Al‟Qaeda is unlikely to comply with any cyber treaty.  Creating an international law will, 
therefore, have the actual effect of crippling our warfighting ability, while our real adversaries 
continue to run rogue.  In addition, even in the event of us encountering a state-sponsored 
adversary, attributing cyber attacks to a particular entity is difficult.  “The challenge of 
attribution in cyberspace provides China [and others] with plausible deniability and makes cyber 
warfare all the more attractive. “Independent” patriotic hackers, cultivated and loosely controlled 
as a 21st-century version of Mao‟s “People‟s War,” provide the perfect mechanism to give the 
PRC cyber threat credibility.”105  If we were to enter into a cyber warfare treaty, we would 
essentially be volunteering to fight war “with one hand behind our back,” while those we are 
likely to fight against will do so with no rule of law in mind—let alone a rule governing cyber 
warfare. 
D. The rate of technology will outpace the ability for an international cyber regime 
to produce responsive policy, while the flexibility allotted by the UN Charter are 
able to absorb technological advances. 
An analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, 
contrary to the common-sense "intuitive linear" view. So we won't experience 100 years 
of progress in the 21st century -- it will be more like 20,000 years of progress (at today's 
105 Brian M. Mazanec, The Art of (Cyber) War, The Journal of International Security Affairs, Spring 2009—Number 
16 (2009) available at http://www.securityaffairs.org/issues/2009/16/mazanec.php. 
rate). The "returns," such as chip speed and cost-effectiveness, also increase 
exponentially. There's even exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth.106 
In the time it will take the international community to produce cyber policy, technology 
would have gone through another revolution.107  Furthermore, if we produce a legal framework 
solely based on cyber warfare, then hackers will be smart enough to find loopholes in the law 
and craft their cyber attacks around those laws.  Instead, we should allow the continued 
flexibility of the UN Charter and laws of war to continue to govern the way we conduct warfare; 
even in the information age.  This is exactly why the UN Charter is broad and does not limit 
itself to any particular technology. 
VI. Conclusion 
The laws of war will be tested by cyber warfare in two situations: first, prior to the 
commencement of an armed conflict;108 second, when an armed conflict is ongoing.109  In each 
of these situations, the current laws of war can address the emerging issues raised by cyber 
warfare.  Although several hot-button issues related to cyber warfare are often discussed and fuel 
the cyber warfare debate, they may not be issues at all.110  A careful analysis shows that the 
current UN Charter and Laws of War should continue to govern cyber warfare.  Creating an 
international treaty or law for cyber warfare would do more harm than good and seriously cripple 
our ability to conduct war.111
