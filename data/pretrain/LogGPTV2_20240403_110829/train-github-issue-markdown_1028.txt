This is on master and a recent build of the release-0.3 branch.
If there are duplicates in the indexes, `sparsevec` creates a matrix as
advertised, and values with duplicate indexes are added by default.
    julia> sv = sparsevec([1,1,2,3,4], ones(5))
    4x1 sparse matrix with 4 Float64 entries:
        [1, 1]  =  2.0
        [2, 1]  =  1.0
        [3, 1]  =  1.0
        [4, 1]  =  1.0
But the `rowval` and `nvval` fields sometimes but not always have extra
values.
    julia> sv.rowval
    5-element Array{Int64,1}:
     1
     2
     3
     4
     4
I'm not sure that this is actually a bug, because it seems intentional, but
this causes hcat not to work:
    julia> [sv sv]
    ERROR: DimensionMismatch("tried to assign 5 elements to 4 destinations")
     in throw_setindex_mismatch at operators.jl:233
     in setindex! at array.jl:330
     in hcat at sparse/sparsematrix.jl:1802
Using `sparse([1,1,2,3,4], ones(Int, 5), ones(5))` instead of `sparsevec` does
not cause this issue.
