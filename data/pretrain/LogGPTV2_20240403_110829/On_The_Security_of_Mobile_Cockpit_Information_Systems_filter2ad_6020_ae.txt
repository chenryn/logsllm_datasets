similar avionics systems? Our examination of three of the most
popular systems showed that the answer is No. Existing systems
allowed an attacker to compromise system integrity in multiple
ways, allowing attacker-controlled information to be presented to
the pilot. To understand the potential impact of such attacks, we
explored several scenarios in which an attacker-controlled MCIS
could severely compromise ﬂight safety.
Fortunately, the vulnerabilities we identiﬁed in existing systems
are easily ﬁxed by adhering to existing computer security best prac-
tices. We presented a set of recommendations that eliminate existing
vulnerabilities.
