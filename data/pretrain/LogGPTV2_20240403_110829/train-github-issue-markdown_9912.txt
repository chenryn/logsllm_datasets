### Bug report
**Bug summary**
When using pyplot, pyplot.savefig() throws a warning which is non-existent
with figure.Figure.savefig(). Upon understanding the warning message and some
investigation, it should be associated with figManager adding duplicate
"sources of save" to Glib when saving "the current figure" (i.e. it does not
recongize the figure being saved is the same as current figure. )
This is important as plt.savefig() is usually the way to go when using the
matlab style plotting provided by pyplot package. Currently, using
plt.gcf().savefig('1.png') would make this error go away, but that's using the
object-oriented style of coding, which would require a change in ways of
thinking and hence may cause confusion.
Suggestion: add a check of the internal figure id in pyplot.savefig() would
prevent any duplicates from being generated.
**Code for reproduction**
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
    plt.savefig('1.png')
**Actual outcome**
This shows up in the terminal
    /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/matplotlib/backends/backend_gtk3.py:195: Warning: Source ID 4 was not found when attempting to remove it
      GLib.source_remove(self._idle_draw_id)
**Expected outcome**
No warning should be thrown.
