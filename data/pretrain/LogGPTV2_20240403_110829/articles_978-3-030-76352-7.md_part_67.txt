On the basis of the three dimensional concept of trust, security is not privacy but
a means to provide the ability to generate privacy by enabling the control of digital
information.Securitybyitselfthereforedoesnotnecessarilyimplyprivacynortrust[5].

Some regulations may limit the choice of a supplier or a service provider as
they require compliance with specific certifications or place restrictions on certain
nationalities of the provider in addition to technological requirements [11, 14]. A
service provider’s information systems may also be conditioned to specific security
requirements,restrictiveinternalprocesses,certificationorgovernmentapprovals[14].
3 ARiskOriginatingfromDataRegulation Enforcement
Policymakersestablishthroughlegaltexts,differentsetsofrulesandobligationsthat
both public and private organizations must follow. Following the basis of reduction
theory [17] and information theory [18], policy makers ensure trust through greater
exchangeofinformation,decreaseofuncertaintyandincreaseofperceivedpredictability.
For the purpose of this contribution, this section will focus on laws regulating data
processing, information technology and services. Finally we present a definition of a
newmulti-disciplinaryrisks’classinherenttoDataRegulation.

A Unique Risk. The norms foresee two different types of sanction in case of non-
compliance: business sanctions and criminal charges. The penalties may only be
pronounced by a norm authority, is context dependent and depends on an external
appreciationofthenorm.
Indeed,DataRegulationRiskdoesnotoriginatefromclassicITrelatedriskssuchas

topenaltiesifcompliancetothelawisproven.Inaddition,basedonjurisprudenceand
interpretations, non-compliance may not necessarily result in penalties. For instance,
the absence of prejudice caused by a data breach may not trigger a GDPR penalty.
Non-compliance that does not lead to a sanction may therefore not constitute a DRR.
