### Tree Reshaping in SMRP

#### Overview
The following sequence of steps and conditions outlines the tree reshaping process in the Scalable Multicast Routing Protocol (SMRP). This process ensures that the multicast tree remains efficient and robust, even as new members join or existing members leave.

#### Tree Reshaping Process
1. **Initial Configuration:**
   - The initial state of the tree is represented by the sequence of nodes and their respective SHRS,R values.
   - Example:
     ```
     A(2)
     B(1)
     3
     3
     2
     7
     6
     2
     C
     Join_Req
     D(4)
     3
     F(5)
     2
     G(2)
     Join_Req
     2
     3
     2
     3
     E(5)
     ```

2. **Triggering Conditions for Tree Reshaping:**
   - **Condition I: New Member Joining**
     - When a new member \( NR \) joins the tree through a merger node on the path \( PT(S, R) \), the value of \( SHRS,R \) is incremented by the number of links shared by both the new member and the current multicast tree.
     - For example, in Figure 4(d), \( SHRS,D \) increases from 2 to 4 after \( F \) joins the group because the two links, \( LSA \) and \( LAD \), are used in \( F \)'s path.
     - A data structure \( SHRold_{S,Ru} \) at \( R \) records the value of \( SHRS,Ru \) received after the last reshaping process. If the difference between \( SHRS,Ru \) and \( SHRold_{S,Ru} \) exceeds a threshold, a tree-reshaping operation is triggered at \( R \).

   - **Condition II: Departure of Members**
     - When members depart from other on-tree nodes, it may make them candidates for a new path. Each on-tree node \( R \) sets up a periodic timer. Upon expiration, the node initiates another path selection process as if it were joining the multicast group for the first time.

3. **Reshaping Procedure:**
   - **Step 1: Path Selection**
     - The reshaping node determines the new multicast path using the same procedure described in Section 3.2.2.
     - If the new path is inferior to the current one, the reshaping process is unnecessary.
   - **Step 2: Path Switching**
     - After the new path is set up, the reshaping node switches all its communication to the new path and releases the resources on the old path, similar to the member departure procedure.

   - Example:
     - In Figure 5, the increase of \( SHRS,D \) by \( F \)'s sharing of link \( LS,A \) and \( LA,D \) triggers the reshaping process at \( E \).
     - As shown in Figure 5(b), \( E \) completes another path selection process by selecting path \( E \rightarrow C \rightarrow A \rightarrow S \).
     - The new path's merger point, \( A \), has a smaller \( SHRS,A = 2 \) compared to the current path's merger point, \( D \) with \( SHRS,D = 4 \).

#### Discussion

##### Key Aspects and Extensions
1. **Knowledge of Topology:**
   - SMRP assumes each member has full knowledge of the current network topology. To address this, a query scheme is developed where each new member relies on neighbor nodes to relay query messages to on-tree nodes.
   - The disadvantage of this scheme is that it does not guarantee optimal paths, potentially degrading protocol performance.

2. **Protocol Overhead:**
   - SMRP incurs computation overhead in maintaining \( SHRS,R \). To mitigate this, the re-calculation of \( SHRS,R \) is deferred until a query message from a new member is received.
   - The small overhead introduced by SMRP is acceptable, especially when fast service recovery is required.

3. **Hierarchical Recovery Architecture:**
   - SMRP can be extended to an N-level hierarchical network model, improving scalability.
   - Figure 6 shows a 2-level hierarchical recovery architecture, where members are clustered into recovery domains based on network proximity.
   - Local detour paths within each domain enable fast recovery, as demonstrated in the example of a failure in \( RD0 \) where agent \( A2 \) uses neighbor node \( A3 \) to reconnect to the multicast tree.

#### Simulation Results

##### Simulation Setup
- **Network Topologies:**
  - Generated using GT-ITM, adopting Waxman's random graph model.
  - Parameters include the number of nodes \( N \), multicast members \( NG \), edge density parameter \( \alpha \), and path length bound \( Dthresh \).

##### Evaluation Metrics
- **Recovery Distance (RDR):** Distance between the disconnected member and its local recovery on-tree node.
- **End-to-End Delay (DS,R):** Distance between the source and each multicast member.
- **Tree Cost (CostT):** Sum of link costs in the multicast tree.

##### Analysis of Simulation Results
- **Global Detour vs. Local Detour:**
  - Local detour recovery paths are superior to those established by SPF-based multicast routing protocols.
  - The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SMRP in reducing recovery distance and end-to-end delay while maintaining low tree cost.

By adhering to these guidelines, SMRP ensures that the multicast tree remains efficient and robust, even in dynamic network environments.
