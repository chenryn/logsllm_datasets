Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of the text:

**User:**
I attempted to copy the files to both the `.gnome2/gedit/plugins` and `.local/share/gedit/plugins` directories, but the plugin still does not work. How can I properly install it? I am using Fedora 18 with the LXDE desktop environment.

**Assistant:**
If you are using gedit3, please ensure that the plugin is compatible with gedit3 and not gedit2. You can check this by examining the `*.plugin` file. It should specify `IAge=3` to indicate compatibility with gedit3.

This version is more structured and clearly communicates the user's issue and the assistant's response.
