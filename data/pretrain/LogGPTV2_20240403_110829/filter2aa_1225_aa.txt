Trivia 100 from 2006 qualiﬁer.  And yeah this should be insanely obvious.  The funny part 
though is that the next year, the 100 point question was

A fair amount of CTF has been inside jokes and homages to years past.  If you plan on 
participating, check out and practice on previous years answers and writeups as they will 
make your life much easier.

It’s probably not surprising that I prefer Linux over Windows, though the older and lazier I 
get, the more Steve Jobs takes my money.

this capture the ﬂag team.  
It’s pronounced “last place”, and we’ve been very lucky to have won the Defcon CTF a couple 
times.
1@stplace
our team captain’s 
handle is “@tlas”
if the replacement of 
letters with numbers and 
symbols doesn’t make 
sense to you, it’s probably 
best to quietly leave the 
room now
the team name can be 
read “last place” or 
“ﬁrst place”, 
ambiguously
we wanted to cover 
our bases

Here’s a decent shot of everybody on the team except for two members.
I’m partially visible here in the back, and the rest of the team is:
Plato -- likely the only lawyer who ever has or ever will win CTF
@tlas -- team captain and individual CTF winner in 2005
Mezzendo -- dual network sniffer in addition to defending
Shiruken -- sysadmin extraordinaire (and always the life of IRC during quals whether we’re 
competing or not)
Fury -- or his twin, you gotta watch out for twins, defender
Doc Brown -- reverser/exploiter par excellence and maintainer of nopsr.us
Wrffr -- a secret weapon who gets very little recognition outside the group, but is an 
incredible reverser/exploiter with a long CTF history.
I mentioned Apu was missing in this photo, he has the distinction of acting not only as a 
network monitor and defender, but also as our physical security coordinator, utilizing his ex-
marine skills.
Jrod, also missing from this picture, is another strong contributer to the exploitation side of 
things, and a frequent Defcon and BlackHat presenter/trainer.
As for me, I must not be too good at anything yet since I’ve bounced from defense to offense 
and everything in between over the years.  Fortunately, they keep letting me hang around 
anyway.
