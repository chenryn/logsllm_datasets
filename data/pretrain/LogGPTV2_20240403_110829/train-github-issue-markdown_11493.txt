When you hover over an open tab, a helpful tooltip appears, displaying the full path of the file that is currently open. This feature is quite useful. However, there is an issue: if you close the tab using CMD-W while the tooltip is still visible, the tooltip does not disappear. Instead, it remains on the screen, incorrectly pointing to tabs that no longer contain the original file.
