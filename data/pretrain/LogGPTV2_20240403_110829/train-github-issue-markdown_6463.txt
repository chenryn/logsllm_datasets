# Bug report
I have posted question regarding to it on stackowerflow here:  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70140202/webpack-defineplugin-process-env-
node-env-is-undefined  
I am not too good with front-end technologies... So if I have wrong
expectations - please correct me or my code. I have created a repository with
code that allows to reproduce issue. Here is the link:
https://github.com/ffatheranderson/webpack-issue-reproduction
**What is the current behavior?**
After I execute npm run watch command - the generated result/bundle.js file
contains such lines:
...  
var _environment = undefined;  
var _ANOTHER_VARIABLE = "another variable value";  
...
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
**What is the expected behavior?**
I expect that after I execute npm run watch command - the generated
result/bundle.js file to have such lines:
...  
var _environment = 'development';  
var _ANOTHER_VARIABLE = "another variable value";  
...
I have such expectation because of these lines in in webpack.config.js file:
plugins: [  
new webpack.DefinePlugin({  
ENVIRONMENT: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),  
ANOTHER_VARIABLE: JSON.stringify("another variable value"),  
})  
]  
...
**Other relevant information:**  
webpack version: 5.64.4
