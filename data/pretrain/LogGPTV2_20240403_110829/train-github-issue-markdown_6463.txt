# Bug Report

I have posted a question about this issue on Stack Overflow:  
[Stack Overflow Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70140202/webpack-defineplugin-process-env-node-env-is-undefined)

I am not very experienced with front-end technologies, so if my expectations are incorrect, please correct me or provide feedback on my code. I have created a repository that reproduces the issue. Here is the link:  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ffatheranderson/webpack-issue-reproduction)

## Current Behavior
When I run the `npm run watch` command, the generated `result/bundle.js` file contains the following lines:
```javascript
var _environment = undefined;
var _ANOTHER_VARIABLE = "another variable value";
```

## Expected Behavior
After running the `npm run watch` command, I expect the generated `result/bundle.js` file to contain the following lines:
```javascript
var _environment = 'development';
var _ANOTHER_VARIABLE = "another variable value";
```
I have this expectation based on the following configuration in my `webpack.config.js` file:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    ENVIRONMENT: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),
    ANOTHER_VARIABLE: JSON.stringify("another variable value"),
  })
]
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ffatheranderson/webpack-issue-reproduction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```sh
   cd webpack-issue-reproduction
   ```
3. Run the `npm run watch` command:  
   ```sh
   npm run watch
   ```
4. Check the generated `result/bundle.js` file for the values of `_environment` and `_ANOTHER_VARIABLE`.

## Relevant Information
- Webpack version: 5.64.4
