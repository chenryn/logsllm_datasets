User: I have just installed Python 3.4.3 on my MAC (Yosemite). I need to install a couple of lxml, however everytime I type in: pip install /""/, I get error messages.
I have followed multiple tutorials and pip is installed.
MAC already had Python 2.7., but I installed the 3.4.3. version, not sure if that is the issue.
The error message is:

Brunos-MacBook-Pro:~ BrunoPaesLeme$ pip install /Macintosh HD/Users//Downloads/pycairo-1.10.0-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl
  Exception:

  ValueError: ('Missing distribution spec', '/Macintosh')  

Anybody knows what I could be doing wrong? Any help would be appreciated.
Assistant: I have similar issue with pip install. However, if I do "sudo su -" then do my pip install 'fileName', that solve the problem for me.
