I recently installed Python 3.4.3 on my Mac (Yosemite) and am trying to install the `lxml` package. However, every time I run the `pip install` command, I encounter error messages.

I have followed several tutorials, and `pip` is correctly installed. My Mac already had Python 2.7, but I installed the 3.4.3 version, and I'm not sure if this is causing the issue.

The error message I receive is as follows:

```bash
Brunos-MacBook-Pro:~ BrunoPaesLeme$ pip install /Macintosh HD/Users//Downloads/pycairo-1.10.0-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl
Exception:

    raise ValueError("Missing distribution spec", line)
ValueError: ('Missing distribution spec', '/Macintosh')
```

Could anyone help me understand what I might be doing wrong? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

**Response:**

I encountered a similar issue with `pip install`. One solution that worked for me was to use `sudo su -` to switch to the root user and then run the `pip install` command. For example:

```bash
sudo su -
pip install fileName
```

This approach solved the problem for me.
