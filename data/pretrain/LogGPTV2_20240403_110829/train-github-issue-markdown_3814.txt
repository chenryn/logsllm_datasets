Using `1.0.0-beta.21`.  
I have something like this:
             }
              onRequestClose={this.handleAddProductClose}
            >
                    Select product
                 options()}
                  onSuggestionSelected={this.handleAddProduct}
                />
When closing the dialog the `` remains and,
although the contents are not visible, it blocks any interaction with the
page.  
If I remove `transition={props => }` the
div is removed on close.
I see the same behaviour (div remains attached) with the docs demo but there
there's no obstruction.
Anything I can do do provide more info ?
