we also calculate conﬁdence intervals.
In the case of
the median, conﬁdence intervals are usually formulated
as a binomial calculation and are distribution free [20].
In this work we approximate this calculation with the
Wilson score [50] since it has been reported to perform
well even with a small number of samples [34]. The
Wilson score is deﬁned as follows:

This deviation represents the gap separating the two
conﬁdence intervals and is relative to the usual uncer-
tainty measured by the reference conﬁdence interval.
Values close to zero represent small delay changes while
large values represent important changes.
Figure 2 exhibits conﬁdence intervals along with the
corresponding normal reference. As the reference in-
tersects with all conﬁdence intervals, no anomaly is re-
ported for this link. The evaluation section presents
several examples of anomalies. For example, Figure 7c
depicts two conﬁdence intervals deviating from the nor-
mal reference on November 30th.
4.2.4 Normal reference computation
In the previous section we assumed a reference dif-
ferential RTT distribution for each link. We will now
show how to compute this. The goal of the references
is to characterize the usual delays of observed links. As
median diﬀerential RTT values are normally distributed
(§ 4.2.2), the expected median value for a link is simply
obtained as the arithmetic mean of previously observed
medians for that link. Because anomalies might impair
mean values and make them irrelevant as references,
we employ exponential smoothing to estimate the me-
dians’ mean value to reduce the impact of anomalies.
Exponential smoothing also facilitates the online im-
plementation of our delay change method for near real
time analysis [4, 2]. Let mt = ∆(m) be the median dif-
ferential RTT observed for a certain link in time bin t,
and, ¯mt−1 = ¯∆(m) be the reference median computed
with median diﬀerential RTTs observed in the previous
time bin, t − 1. Then the next reference median, ¯mt is
deﬁned as:
¯mt = αmt + (1 − α) ¯mt−1
(7)
The only parameter for the exponential smoothing, α ∈
(0, 1), controls the importance of new measures as op-
posed to the previously observed ones.
In our case a
small α value is preferable as it lets us mitigate the
impact of anomalous values. The initial value of the
reference, ¯m0, is quite important when α is small. We
arbitrarily set this value using the ﬁrst three time bins,
namely, ¯m0 = median(m1, m2, m3).
For the reference conﬁdence interval, the lower and
upper bounds (resp. ¯∆(l) and ¯∆(u)) are computed in
the same way as the reference median ( ¯∆(m)) but using
the boundary values given by the Wilson score (i.e. ∆(l)
and ∆(u)).

4.3 Probe diversity
The above diﬀerential RTT analysis applies only un-
der certain conditions. Section 4.1 shows that monitor-
ing ∆XY reveals delay changes between router X and
Y only if the following hold true. (1) The link is mon-
itored by several probes and the return paths to these
probes are disparate. (2) All returning packets are also
going through the link XY but in the opposite direc-
tion. Therefore, if we have diﬀerential RTT values ∆XY
from ten probes which share the same asymmetric re-
turn path, we cannot distinguish delay changes on XY
from delay changes in the return path, so these diﬀer-
ential RTT values cannot be used.
To ﬁlter out ambiguous diﬀerential RTTs we avoid
links monitored only by probes from the same AS (thus
more likely to share the same return path due to com-
mon inter-domain routing policies); but instead, take
advantage of the wide deployment of Atlas probes and
focus on links monitored from a variety of ASs. We
devise two criteria to control the diversity of probes
monitoring a link.
The ﬁrst criterion ﬁlters out links that are monitored
by probes from less than 3 diﬀerent ASs. The value 3 is
empirically set to provide conservative results and can
be lowered to increase the number of monitored links
but at the cost of result accuracy. To determine this
value we make the following hypothesis. Links where
the error added by return paths is not mitigated by
probe diversity are reported more frequently as their
diﬀerential RTTs also account for links on the return
path. For links visited by probes from at least 3 diﬀer-
ent ASs we observe a weak positive correlation (0.24)
between the average number of reported alarms and the
number of probes monitoring a link. Meaning that links
observed by a small number of diverse probes are not
reported more than those monitored by a large num-
ber of probes, thus a small diversity of return paths is
enough to mitigate the error added by return paths.
This simple criterion allows us to avoid ambiguous
results when links are monitored from only a few ASs,
but is insuﬃcient to control probe diversity. For in-
stance, a link XY is monitored by 100 probes located
in 5 diﬀerent ASs but 90 of these probes are in the same
AS. Then, the corresponding diﬀerential RTT distribu-
tion is governed by the return path shared by these 90
probes, meaning that delay changes on this return path
are indistinguishable from delay changes on XY .
The second criterion ﬁnds links with an unbalanced
number of probes per AS. Measuring such information
dispersion is commonly addressed using normalized en-
tropy. Let A = {ai|i ∈ [1, n]} be the number of probes
for each of the n ASs monitoring a certain link, then the
entropy H(A) is deﬁned as: H(A) = − 1
Low entropy values, H(A) (cid:39) 0, mean that most of the
probes are concentrated in one AS, and, high entropy
(cid:80)n
ln n
i=1 P (ai) ln P (ai).
values, H(A) (cid:39) 1, indicate that probes are evenly dis-
persed among ASs. This second criterion ensures that
analyzed links feature an entropy H(A) > 0.5.
If the second criterion is not met (i.e. H(A) ≤ 0.5)
the link is not discarded. Instead, a probe from the most
represented AS (namely AS i such as ai = max(A)) is
randomly selected and discarded, thus increasing the
value of H(A). This process is repeated until H(A) >
0.5, hence the corresponding diﬀerential RTTs are rel-
evant for our analysis.
4.4 Theoretical limitations
In our experiments we conservatively set the time
bin to one hour, consequently, the shortest event we
can detect for a link monitored by three vantage points
is 33 minutes long (see Appendix B). Using measure-
ments with a high probing rate overcomes this limita-
tion, for instance, anchoring measurements can detect
events lasting only 9 minutes.
Low frequency traceroute measurements originally de-
signed for topology discovery are not suitable for our
approach. For example, the IPv4 Routed /24 Topology
Dataset from CAIDA [1] has a 48 hour cycle which is
not appropriate to monitor transient delay changes.
5. FORWARDING ANOMALIES
Latency is a good indicator of network health, but de-
ﬁcient in certain cases. For example, if traﬃc is rerouted
or probing packets are lost then the lack of RTT sam-
ples impedes delay analysis. We refer to these cases
as forwarding anomalies. In this section we introduce a
method to detect forwarding anomalies, complementing
the delay analysis method presented in Section 4.
A forwarding anomaly can be legitimate, for exam-
ple rerouted traﬃc, but it can also highlight compelling
events such as link failures or routers dropping pack-
ets. Using traceroute data, such events appear as router
hops vanishing from our dataset. So our approach mon-
itors where packets are forwarded and constructs a sim-
ple packet forwarding model (§ 5.1). This model allows
us to predict next hop IP addresses in traceroutes, thus
detecting and identifying disappearing routers (§ 5.2).
5.1 Packet forwarding model
The proposed packet forwarding model learns the next
hops usually observed after each router from past tracer-
oute data. Because routers determine next hops based
on the packet destination IP address, we compute a dif-
ferent model for each traceroute target.
Let us consider traceroutes from all probes to a single
destination in the same time bin. For each router in
these traceroutes we record the adjacent nodes to which
packets have been forwarded. We distinguish two types
of next hop, responsive and unresponsive ones. The
responsive next hops are visible in traceroutes as they

send back ICMP messages when a packet TTL expires.
Next hops that do not send back ICMP packets to the
probes or drop packets are said to be unresponsive and
are indissociable in traceroutes.
Figure 4a illustrates the example of a router R with
two responsive hops, A and B, and unresponsive hop,
Z. The packet forwarding pattern of this router is for-
mally deﬁned as a vector where each element represents
a next hop and the value of the element is the number
of packets transmitted to that hop. For Figure 4a the
forwarding pattern of R is F R = [10, 100, 5].
To summarize router R’s usual patterns and to up-
date this reference with new patterns, we again em-

ploy exponential smoothing. Let F R
be the forwarding pattern for router R at time t and
t−1 = {¯pi|i ∈ [1, n]} be the reference computed at
¯F R
time t − 1. These two vectors are sorted such as pi and
¯pi correspond to the same next hop i. If the hop i is
unseen at time t then pi = 0, similarly, if the hop i is
observed for the ﬁrst time at time t then ¯pi = 0. The

As in Section 4.2.4, a small α value allows us to mitigate
the impact of anomalous values. The reference ¯F R

resents the usual forwarding pattern for router R and
is the normal reference used for the anomaly detection
method discussed in the next section. A reference ¯F R

valid only for a certain destination IP address. In prac-
tice we compute a diﬀerent reference for each traceroute
target; thus, several references are maintained for a sin-
gle router.
5.2 Forwarding anomaly detection
5.2.1 Correlation analysis
Detecting anomalous forwarding patterns consists of
identifying patterns F that deviate from the computed
normal reference ¯F . In normal conditions we expect a
router to forward packets as they did in past observa-
tions. In other words, we expect F and ¯F to be linearly
correlated. This linear dependence is easily measurable

as the Pearson product-moment correlation coeﬃcient
of F and ¯F , hereafter denoted as ρF, ¯F . The values of
ρF, ¯F range in [−1, 1]. Positive values mean that the for-
warding patterns expressed by F and ¯F are compatible,
while negative values indicate opposite patterns hence
forwarding anomalies. Therefore, all patterns F with a
correlation coeﬃcient ρF, ¯F  −0.25 represents very weak anti-correlation.

When a forwarding pattern F is reported as anoma-
lous, it means that the proportions of packets sent to
