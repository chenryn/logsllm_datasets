User: I am trying to use PyPy on a Windows 7 x64 machine but do not find any way to do it.
Apparently there is a win32 binary, but no x64 binary or installation guide.
I am currently using Python 2.7.2 win64 (Python 2.7.2 (default, Jun 12 2011, 14:24:46) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32).
Installation from sources raised the following error:

[translation:ERROR]  WindowsError: [Error 193] %1 is not a valid Win32 application

Does anyone have a guide/hint to use PyPy on a win64?
Or is it just not possible?
Assistant: There's no version available for 64 bit Python on Windows. You appear to have the following options:

Download the source to PyPy and port it to 64 bit.
Switch to 32 bit Python.

Option 2 looks more tractable.
