User: I would like to deploy several WSGI web applications with Twisted on a debian server, and need some direction for a solid production setup. These applications will be running 24/7.

I need to run several configurations, each binding to different ports/interfaces/privileges. 
I want to do as much of this in python as possible.
I do not want to package my applications with a program like 'tap2deb'. 

What is the best way to implement each application as a system service? Do I need some /etc/init.d shell scripts, or can I manage this with python? (I don't want anything quite as heavy as Daemontools)
If I use twistd to manage most of the configuration/process management, what kind of wrappers/supervisors do I need to put in place?
I would like centralized management, but restricting control to the parent user account is not a problem.

The main problem I want to avoid, is having to SSH into my server once a day to restart a blocking/crashed application
Assistant: I have found several good references for launching daemon processes with python. See daemoncmd from pypi.
Im still coming up a little short on the monitoring/alert solutions (in python).
