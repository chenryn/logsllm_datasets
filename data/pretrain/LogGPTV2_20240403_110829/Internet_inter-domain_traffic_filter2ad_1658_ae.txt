As an illustration of the possible migration of P2P towards
other distribution mechanisms, we graph inter-domain traf-
Ô¨Åc to a large direct download site in Figure 8. Normally,
our ASN based analysis cannot identify traÔ¨Éc contributed
by any individual co-located hosting customer. Figure 8
provides an exception.
Carpathia Hosting hosts several
large customer direct
download and video streaming sites including MegaVideo
and MegaUpload (Alexa rank of 72) [45, 44]. We graph
the weighted percentage of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc originat-
ing or terminating in Carpathia‚Äôs ASN (AS29748, AS46742,
and AS35974) in Figure 8.
Private discussions with providers indicate the abrupt and
signiÔ¨Åcant jump in Carpathia inter-domain traÔ¨Éc percent-
ages after January 2009 is due to the migration and con-
solidation of MegaUpload and associated sites on Carpathia
servers. As of July 2009, Carpathia represents a weighted
average of more than 0.8% of all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc.

results as well as estimate the current volume of all inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc and the annualized rate of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc
growth. We compare our Ô¨Åndings with recent research and
commercial estimates of global Internet traÔ¨Éc.
5.1 TrafÔ¨Åc Volume
To provide independent veriÔ¨Åcation of our study measure-
ments, we solicited inter-domain traÔ¨Éc statistics from twelve
large topologically and geographically diverse providers and
content sites. We focused our solicitation on datasets dis-
joint from the 110 anonymous providers in our study. 3
Each provider supplied peak inter-domain traÔ¨Éc volumes
for July 2009. These providers use a combination of in-house
Flow tools or SNMP interface polling to determine their
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc volumes. We use these twelve known
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc values as ‚Äúground-truth.‚Äù
Figure 9 shows a plot of each of the provided traÔ¨Éc vol-
umes against that provider‚Äôs weighted average percentage of
all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc (based on ASN) from our data. We
also shows a linear Ô¨Åt of these measurements. The result-
ing line has a slope of 2.51, meaning that a 2.51% share of
all inter-domain traÔ¨Éc represents approximately 1 Tbps of
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. This provides an extrapolation to the
overall size of the Internet at 1 / 2.51 = 39.8 Tbps as of July
2009.
While exhaustive validation of our results is diÔ¨Écult given
the commercial secrecy surrounding provider traÔ¨Éc statis-
tics, the plot in Figure 9 lends conÔ¨Ådence to our Ô¨Åndings.
The linear Ô¨Åt has an R2 value of 0.91, indicating that our
data and statistical analysis is consistent with the indepen-
dent ‚Äúground-truth‚Äù measurements supplied by the twelve
providers.
We also calculate the absolute number of bytes for the
month of May 2008 for comparison with Cisco‚Äôs last pub-
lished data [23]. This monthly calculated value matches
Cisco‚Äôs Internet traÔ¨Éc estimate of 9 exabytes per month in
2008. Table 5 shows the result of our calculations combined
with data from a private survey of providers and published
reports from Cisco [23] and MINTS [14]. We also corrob-

complete customer list of providers that had purchased the
commercial probes used in our study. We then solicited
inter-domain traÔ¨Éc data from providers without deployed
probes.
orate the data with a private survey of ISPs and content
providers [46].
5.2 TrafÔ¨Åc Growth
To estimate the rate of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc growth, we
compute an annual growth rate (AGR), which represents
the estimated increase in inter-domain traÔ¨Éc volume over a
year period. This annual growth rate is based on daily traÔ¨Éc
samples collected over a one year period at each router asso-
ciated with a participant deployment. To calculate the AGR
for a particular router, we employ a methodology similar to
MINTS [14]. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we determine an exponential Ô¨Åt of
the form y = A ‚àó 10Bx, where x is the day ([1, 365]) and y is
the traÔ¨Éc sample in bps for day x for the router. An exam-
ple curve Ô¨Åt over the daily sample points between May 2008
and May 2009 for a for an anonymous provider can be seen
in Figure 10a. From the results of our linear least squares Ô¨Åt,
we calculate the annual growth rate as AGR = 10365‚àóB . For
example, an AGR of 0.5 represents a 50% decrease in traÔ¨Éc,
1.0 represents no change, 2.0 represents a 100% increase, 3.0
represents a 200% increase, and so on.
However, as discussed in Section 2, changes in the com-
mercial probe infrastructure can complicate our growth esti-
mation. For example, a provider may add, remove, or recon-
Ô¨Ågure routers associated with a particular probe deployment
over time. Frequent changes in measurement infrastructure
combined with misconÔ¨Åguration and other anomalies can
lead to noise within the dataset. Such noise may be present
at three levels of granularity in the dataset: (1) datapoint-
level: datapoints for a single router may be lacking in terms
of the number of valid or non-zero data points; (2) router-
level: Ô¨Åtting a growth curve to an inadequate set of traÔ¨Éc
samples for a router may result in an inaccurate Ô¨Åt, and (3)
deployment-level: deployments may have misconÔ¨Ågured or
anomalous routers or a small number of total routers, re-
sulting in the unstable routers having a large eÔ¨Äect on the
overall deployment.
To deal with these sources of noise within the dataset,
we apply a pass at each level of granularity to smooth out
noise and exclude anomalous and misconÔ¨Ågured routers. For
sample-level noise, we exclude sample sets that do not have
at least 2/3 valid data points throughout the year period.
For router-level noise, we exclude AGR calculations that
exhibit a high standard error when Ô¨Åtting a curve to noisy
sample points. Lastly, we smooth out per-deployment noise
by only considering routers with AGRs between the 1st and
3rd quartiles of the routers within that deployment.
We calculate the overall AGR for a deployment as the
mean of the AGRs of the eligible routers within that de-
ployment. The computed annual growth rates between May
2008 and 2009 for a number of provider deployments (Tier-
1, Tier-2 and cable / DSL providers) in our data are shown
in Figure 10b. In addition to per-deployment AGRs, we cal-
culate AGRs by market segment by taking the mean of the
per-deployment AGRs of the providers within that market
segment. Table 6 breaks down the growth of each market
segment and includes the number of deployments and eligi-
ble routers used to compute each AGR.
In Table 5, we compare our results of inter-domain traf-
Ô¨Åc growth to similar measurement studies from Cisco and
MINTS [23, 14], as well the average growth rates reported
in survey of 25 ISPs. We note that both Cisco and MINTS
report a slightly higher rate of 50%, but the diÔ¨Äerence may

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we provide one of the Ô¨Årst large-scale longi-
tudinal studies of Internet inter-domain traÔ¨Éc. SpeciÔ¨Åcally,
over a two year period we analyzed more than 200 Exabytes
of commercial inter-domain traÔ¨Éc through the direct instru-
mentation of more than 3,000 peering routers across 110 ge-
ographically and topologically diverse Internet providers.
Our main contribution is the identiÔ¨Åcation of a signiÔ¨Åcant
ongoing evolution of provider interconnection strategies and
resultant inter-domain traÔ¨Éc demands, including the rapid
transition to a more densely interconnected and less hier-
archical inter-domain Internet topology.
In particular, we
Ô¨Ånd the majority of inter-domain traÔ¨Éc now Ô¨Çows directly
between large content providers, data center / CDNs, and
consumer networks. We show that as of July 2009, 150
ASNs (out of 30,000 ASN in default-free BGP tables) orig-
inate more than 50% of all Internet inter-domain traÔ¨Éc by
weighted average percentage. We also identity changes in
Internet inter-domain application traÔ¨Éc patterns, including
a signiÔ¨Åcant rise in video traÔ¨Éc and a corresponding decline
in P2P.
While analysts and the press have provided anecdotal dis-
cussion of these macro level Internet trends (e.g., [3]), we
believe this paper represents the Ô¨Årst quantitative character-
ization. We again observe that the emerging new provider
inter-connection strategies have signiÔ¨Åcant ongoing impli-
cations for backbone engineering, design of Internet-scale
applications and research. Given the signiÔ¨Åcant obstacles
intrinsic to commercial inter-domain traÔ¨Éc measurement,
we hope to make our data available to other researchers on
an ongoing basis pending anonymization and privacy discus-
sions with provider study participants.
Overall, we argue the Internet industry is in the midst
of an inÔ¨Çection point out of which new network engineering
design, business models and economies are emerging. Eco-
nomic changes including the decline of wholesale IP tran-
sit prices [2] and the dramatic growth in advertisement-
supported services reversed decade-old business dynamics
between transit providers, consumer networks and content
providers. For example, providers that used to charge con-
tent networks for transit now oÔ¨Äer settlement-free intercon-
nection or, in some cases, may even pay the content networks
for access [5, 6].
As measured in this paper, provider inter-domain traÔ¨Éc
demands provide a key measure of emergent network engi-
neering and commercial strategies. As Google, Microsoft,
Facebook, Baidu and other large content owners and con-
sumer networks compete for virtual real estate and Internet
market share, we expect the trend towards Internet inter-
domain traÔ¨Éc consolidation to continue and even accelerate.
