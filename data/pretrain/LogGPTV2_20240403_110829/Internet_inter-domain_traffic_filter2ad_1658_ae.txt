As an illustration of the possible migration of P2P towards
other distribution mechanisms, we graph inter-domain traf-
ﬁc to a large direct download site in Figure 8. Normally,
our ASN based analysis cannot identify traﬃc contributed
by any individual co-located hosting customer. Figure 8
provides an exception.
Carpathia Hosting hosts several
large customer direct
download and video streaming sites including MegaVideo
and MegaUpload (Alexa rank of 72) [45, 44]. We graph
the weighted percentage of all inter-domain traﬃc originat-
ing or terminating in Carpathia’s ASN (AS29748, AS46742,
and AS35974) in Figure 8.
Private discussions with providers indicate the abrupt and
signiﬁcant jump in Carpathia inter-domain traﬃc percent-
ages after January 2009 is due to the migration and con-
solidation of MegaUpload and associated sites on Carpathia
servers. As of July 2009, Carpathia represents a weighted
average of more than 0.8% of all inter-domain traﬃc.

results as well as estimate the current volume of all inter-
domain traﬃc and the annualized rate of inter-domain traﬃc
growth. We compare our ﬁndings with recent research and
commercial estimates of global Internet traﬃc.
5.1 Trafﬁc Volume
To provide independent veriﬁcation of our study measure-
ments, we solicited inter-domain traﬃc statistics from twelve
large topologically and geographically diverse providers and
content sites. We focused our solicitation on datasets dis-
joint from the 110 anonymous providers in our study. 3
Each provider supplied peak inter-domain traﬃc volumes
for July 2009. These providers use a combination of in-house
Flow tools or SNMP interface polling to determine their
inter-domain traﬃc volumes. We use these twelve known
inter-domain traﬃc values as “ground-truth.”
Figure 9 shows a plot of each of the provided traﬃc vol-
umes against that provider’s weighted average percentage of
all inter-domain traﬃc (based on ASN) from our data. We
also shows a linear ﬁt of these measurements. The result-
ing line has a slope of 2.51, meaning that a 2.51% share of
all inter-domain traﬃc represents approximately 1 Tbps of
inter-domain traﬃc. This provides an extrapolation to the
overall size of the Internet at 1 / 2.51 = 39.8 Tbps as of July
2009.
While exhaustive validation of our results is diﬃcult given
the commercial secrecy surrounding provider traﬃc statis-
tics, the plot in Figure 9 lends conﬁdence to our ﬁndings.
The linear ﬁt has an R2 value of 0.91, indicating that our
data and statistical analysis is consistent with the indepen-
dent “ground-truth” measurements supplied by the twelve
providers.
We also calculate the absolute number of bytes for the
month of May 2008 for comparison with Cisco’s last pub-
lished data [23]. This monthly calculated value matches
Cisco’s Internet traﬃc estimate of 9 exabytes per month in
2008. Table 5 shows the result of our calculations combined
with data from a private survey of providers and published
reports from Cisco [23] and MINTS [14]. We also corrob-

complete customer list of providers that had purchased the

probes.
orate the data with a private survey of ISPs and content
providers [46].
5.2 Trafﬁc Growth
To estimate the rate of inter-domain traﬃc growth, we
compute an annual growth rate (AGR), which represents
the estimated increase in inter-domain traﬃc volume over a
year period. This annual growth rate is based on daily traﬃc
samples collected over a one year period at each router asso-
ciated with a participant deployment. To calculate the AGR
for a particular router, we employ a methodology similar to
MINTS [14]. Speciﬁcally, we determine an exponential ﬁt of
the form y = A ∗ 10Bx, where x is the day ([1, 365]) and y is
the traﬃc sample in bps for day x for the router. An exam-
ple curve ﬁt over the daily sample points between May 2008
and May 2009 for a for an anonymous provider can be seen
in Figure 10a. From the results of our linear least squares ﬁt,
we calculate the annual growth rate as AGR = 10365∗B . For
example, an AGR of 0.5 represents a 50% decrease in traﬃc,
1.0 represents no change, 2.0 represents a 100% increase, 3.0
represents a 200% increase, and so on.
However, as discussed in Section 2, changes in the com-
mercial probe infrastructure can complicate our growth esti-
mation. For example, a provider may add, remove, or recon-
ﬁgure routers associated with a particular probe deployment
over time. Frequent changes in measurement infrastructure
combined with misconﬁguration and other anomalies can
lead to noise within the dataset. Such noise may be present
at three levels of granularity in the dataset: (1) datapoint-
level: datapoints for a single router may be lacking in terms
of the number of valid or non-zero data points; (2) router-
level: ﬁtting a growth curve to an inadequate set of traﬃc
samples for a router may result in an inaccurate ﬁt, and (3)
deployment-level: deployments may have misconﬁgured or
anomalous routers or a small number of total routers, re-
sulting in the unstable routers having a large eﬀect on the
overall deployment.
To deal with these sources of noise within the dataset,
we apply a pass at each level of granularity to smooth out
noise and exclude anomalous and misconﬁgured routers. For
sample-level noise, we exclude sample sets that do not have
at least 2/3 valid data points throughout the year period.
For router-level noise, we exclude AGR calculations that
exhibit a high standard error when ﬁtting a curve to noisy
sample points. Lastly, we smooth out per-deployment noise
by only considering routers with AGRs between the 1st and
3rd quartiles of the routers within that deployment.
We calculate the overall AGR for a deployment as the
mean of the AGRs of the eligible routers within that de-
ployment. The computed annual growth rates between May
2008 and 2009 for a number of provider deployments (Tier-
1, Tier-2 and cable / DSL providers) in our data are shown
in Figure 10b. In addition to per-deployment AGRs, we cal-
culate AGRs by market segment by taking the mean of the
per-deployment AGRs of the providers within that market
segment. Table 6 breaks down the growth of each market
segment and includes the number of deployments and eligi-
ble routers used to compute each AGR.
In Table 5, we compare our results of inter-domain traf-
ﬁc growth to similar measurement studies from Cisco and
MINTS [23, 14], as well the average growth rates reported
in survey of 25 ISPs. We note that both Cisco and MINTS
report a slightly higher rate of 50%, but the diﬀerence may

6. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we provide one of the ﬁrst large-scale longi-
tudinal studies of Internet inter-domain traﬃc. Speciﬁcally,
over a two year period we analyzed more than 200 Exabytes
of commercial inter-domain traﬃc through the direct instru-
mentation of more than 3,000 peering routers across 110 ge-
ographically and topologically diverse Internet providers.
Our main contribution is the identiﬁcation of a signiﬁcant
ongoing evolution of provider interconnection strategies and
resultant inter-domain traﬃc demands, including the rapid
transition to a more densely interconnected and less hier-
archical inter-domain Internet topology.
In particular, we
ﬁnd the majority of inter-domain traﬃc now ﬂows directly
between large content providers, data center / CDNs, and
consumer networks. We show that as of July 2009, 150
ASNs (out of 30,000 ASN in default-free BGP tables) orig-
inate more than 50% of all Internet inter-domain traﬃc by
weighted average percentage. We also identity changes in
Internet inter-domain application traﬃc patterns, including
a signiﬁcant rise in video traﬃc and a corresponding decline
in P2P.
While analysts and the press have provided anecdotal dis-
cussion of these macro level Internet trends (e.g., [3]), we
believe this paper represents the ﬁrst quantitative character-
ization. We again observe that the emerging new provider
inter-connection strategies have signiﬁcant ongoing impli-
cations for backbone engineering, design of Internet-scale
applications and research. Given the signiﬁcant obstacles
intrinsic to commercial inter-domain traﬃc measurement,
we hope to make our data available to other researchers on
an ongoing basis pending anonymization and privacy discus-
sions with provider study participants.
Overall, we argue the Internet industry is in the midst
of an inﬂection point out of which new network engineering
design, business models and economies are emerging. Eco-
nomic changes including the decline of wholesale IP tran-
sit prices [2] and the dramatic growth in advertisement-
supported services reversed decade-old business dynamics
between transit providers, consumer networks and content
providers. For example, providers that used to charge con-
tent networks for transit now oﬀer settlement-free intercon-
nection or, in some cases, may even pay the content networks
for access [5, 6].
As measured in this paper, provider inter-domain traﬃc
demands provide a key measure of emergent network engi-
neering and commercial strategies. As Google, Microsoft,
Facebook, Baidu and other large content owners and con-
sumer networks compete for virtual real estate and Internet
market share, we expect the trend towards Internet inter-
domain traﬃc consolidation to continue and even accelerate.
