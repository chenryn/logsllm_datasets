For efficient, full-text searching on Google App Engine with minimal effort and without using Java (since you are working with Python), there are a few options to consider. One promising solution is to wait for the upcoming native full-text search feature in the Datastore, which has been announced by Google. However, if you need a solution right away, you might want to explore third-party services or libraries that can integrate seamlessly with your Python application. For instance, Algolia or Elasticsearch could be viable alternatives, as they provide powerful full-text search capabilities and have Python client libraries available. These services can significantly reduce the amount of work required to implement robust search functionality.
