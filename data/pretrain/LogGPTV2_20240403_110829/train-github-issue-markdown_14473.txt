It would be excellent if Flutter had native support for the YouTube API. Currently, I am using a WebView to display the YouTube player within an iframe. Is it possible to develop a Flutter plugin that integrates with the YouTube API? I have experience primarily in web development and am new to both Flutter and mobile app development for Android and iOS.
