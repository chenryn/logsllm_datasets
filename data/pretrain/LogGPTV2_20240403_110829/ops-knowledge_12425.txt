User: I know Twisted is a framework that allows you to do asynchronous non-blocking i/o but I still do not understand how that is different from what Apache server does. If anyone could explain the need for twisted, I would appreciate it..
Assistant: They are two different things, one is a pure WEB server and one is a WEB framework with a builtin event driven servers.
Twisted is good for constructing high-end ad-hoc network services.
