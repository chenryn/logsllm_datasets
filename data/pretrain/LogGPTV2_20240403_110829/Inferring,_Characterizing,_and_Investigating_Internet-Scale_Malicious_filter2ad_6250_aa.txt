## Abstract
Recent cyber-attacks have underscored the vulnerabilities in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, demonstrating the significant impact of leveraging compromised IoT devices on a global scale. This paper addresses the scarcity of empirical data specific to IoT by analyzing over 5TB of passive measurements. We develop data-driven methodologies to infer compromised IoT devices and those targeted by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Our large-scale characterization analysis of their traffic, combined with an exploration of a public threat repository and an in-house malware database, reveals their malicious activities. The results highlight approximately 26,000 compromised IoT devices, with 40% active in critical infrastructure. Additionally, we uncover new, previously unreported malware variants specifically targeting IoT devices. These findings provide the first empirical evidence of the large-scale insecurity of the IoT paradigm and raise concerns about the emergence of new generations of IoT-centric, malware-orchestrated botnets.

## 1. Introduction
In recent years, the widespread adoption of Internet-connected devices, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has transformed various aspects of our lives. IoT devices and associated technologies facilitate efficient data collection, monitoring, and information sharing for consumers (e.g., Internet routers, smart TVs, health monitoring wearables) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) (e.g., power utilities, manufacturing plants, factory automation). Despite their benefits, the always-connected nature of these devices and the inadequate security measures implemented by some manufacturers have made them attractive targets for cyber adversaries. Moreover, IoT devices can be used to orchestrate large-scale attacks, such as the Mirai botnet, which utilized millions of compromised IoT devices (e.g., CCTV cameras) to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, disrupting services for millions of Internet users globally. More recently, the Reaper botnet extended Mirai's capabilities by exploiting IoT-specific vulnerabilities rather than just guessing credentials.

To mitigate large-scale, IoT-related cyber-attacks, security researchers and operators need to assess the extent of Internet-scale IoT exploitations and characterize their malicious activities. However, the lack of empirical data and the extensive deployment of IoT devices in consumer and CPS environments pose significant challenges. There is a pressing need to explore data-driven methodologies to understand the characteristics of compromised IoT devices and their malicious behaviors. Gaining an Internet-scale perspective of IoT devices and their unsolicited activities over time is challenging due to the need for authorization from various entities and the underlying privacy implications. Furthermore, the vast number of IoT devices operating worldwide requires scalable systems and substantial resources.

An effective approach to gain Internet-wide cyber threat intelligence is to study passive measurements gathered using designated sensors or traps that collect traffic from the Internet, known as darknets or network telescopes. Traffic destined to these inactive hosts is likely to represent suspicious and unsolicited activities, including scanning, backscatter traffic from DDoS attacks, and misconfigurations. By carefully studying darknet traffic, one can generate useful insights into unsolicited traffic from different sources, including compromised machines and DDoS attack victims. In this work, we aim to address the problems of inferring Internet-scale compromised IoT devices and analyzing their unsolicited/malicious activities by exploring auxiliary, macroscopic, empirical passive darknet data obtained from a large network telescope. Specifically, our contributions are:

- **Empirical Characterization**: We analyze close to 5TB of recent darknet data and correlate it with a near real-time IoT database to empirically characterize the magnitude of Internet-scale IoT exploitations in both consumer and critical CPS realms. This provides the first empirical insights into the large-scale insecurity of the IoT paradigm and contributes to operational cybersecurity by providing Internet-wide, IoT-tailored notifications of such exploitations.
- **Large-Scale Analysis**: We perform a first-of-a-kind, large-scale empirical characterization and analysis of IoT-centric unsolicited activities as perceived by a large network telescope. We uncover the nature of such traffic, its sources, employed protocols, targeted ports, and other relevant details. Given the lack of IoT-specific attack signatures, the analyzed traffic could be leveraged to design such signatures and facilitate further IoT-tailored forensic investigations.
- **Malware Discovery**: Motivated by the rise of new malware families/variants specifically targeting IoT devices, we execute non-intrusive correlations between passive measurements and malware threat intelligence to uncover new, previously unreported malware families. We explore a publicly available threat repository and an in-house built malware database facilitated by instrumenting a large corpus of malware samples in a controlled sandbox. The results not only highlight the severity of this malware issue but also pave the way for future work addressing the rise of IoT-centric, orchestrated botnets.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the recent literature to highlight the uniqueness of the proposed work. Section 3 details the methodology to infer Internet-scale compromised IoT devices by leveraging network telescopes. Section 4 performs a large-scale empirical characterization of the generated unsolicited traffic from such IoT devices, emphasizing the nature of the traffic. Section 5 explores the maliciousness of the identified IoT devices, highlighting their involvement in various misdemeanors and pinpointing several newly discovered IoT-specific malware families. Section 6 provides a discussion on insightful observations and current work limitations, while Section 7 summarizes the outcomes and highlights topics for future work.

## 2. Related Work
In this section, we review the literature on various related topics and highlight the added value of the proposed work.

### IoT Security and Protocol Vulnerabilities
Most IoT security research focuses on synthesizing context-aware permission models. For example, Yu et al. [5] proposed a policy abstraction language to capture relevant environmental contexts, security details, and cross-device interactions for vetting IoT-specific network activities. Jia et al. [15] proposed ContextIoT, a system supporting complex IoT-relevant permission models through efficient and usable program-flow and runtime taint analysis. Fernandes et al. [16] proposed a similar program-flow tracking approach using taint arithmetic to detect policy violations and restrict traffic from exploited IoT applications. In the context of protocol vulnerabilities, Ur et al. [17] studied home automation IoT devices and unveiled insights into the security and usability of implemented access control models. Ronen and Shamir [18] demonstrated information leakage attacks by instrumenting IoT smart lights.

### IoT Data Capturing Initiatives
Given the rarity of IoT-relevant empirical data, several recent efforts have been proposed to collect, curate, and analyze such data. Pa et al. [19] designed and deployed IoTPOT, the first IoT-tailored honeypot, emulating Telnet services of various IoT devices running on different CPU architectures. Guarnizo et al. [20] presented SIPHON, a scalable high-interaction honeypot platform for IoT devices, demonstrating how to mimic various IoT devices on the Internet and attract significant malicious traffic.

### Network Telescope Measurements and Analysis
The use of network telescopes to monitor unused IP addresses for security purposes was first introduced in the early 1990s by Bellovin for AT&Tâ€™s Bell Labs Internet-connected computers [21], [22]. Since then, the focus of network telescope studies has shifted several times, following the evolving nature of threat actors. Key contributions include the discovery of the relationship between backscattered traffic and DDoS attacks in 2001 [23], worm propagation analysis between 2003 and 2005 [24], [25], the use of time series and data mining techniques on telescope traffic in 2008 [26], the monitoring of large-scale cyber events through telescopes in 2014 [27], and more recently, the study of amplification DDoS attacks using telescope sensors [28], [29].

This paper extends network telescope research to address the problem of IoT security, which has yet to be fully explored. We develop unique data-driven methodologies to infer and characterize compromised IoT devices, their unsolicited traffic, and their involvement in illicit activities. The paper also sheds light on new, previously undocumented malware families specifically targeting IoT devices.

## 3. Identifying Unsolicited Internet-Scale IoT Devices
We begin by addressing the problem of identifying and characterizing Internet-scale unsolicited IoT devices. An IoT device is considered unsolicited (or compromised) if it generates any network packets towards the network telescope. Section 4 will detail the nature of such unsolicited traffic and provide an in-depth characterization of its modus operandi. Here, we initially elaborate on the employed datasets and subsequently present the methodology for identifying and characterizing these devices.
