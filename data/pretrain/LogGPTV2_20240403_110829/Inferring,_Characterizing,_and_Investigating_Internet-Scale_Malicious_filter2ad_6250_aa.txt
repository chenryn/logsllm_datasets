Abstract—Recent attacks have highlighted the insecurity of
the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm by demonstrating the
impacts of leveraging Internet-scale compromised IoT devices.
In this paper, we address the lack of IoT-speciﬁc empirical
data by drawing upon more than 5TB of passive measurements.
We devise data-driven methodologies to infer compromised IoT
devices and those targeted by denial of service attacks. We
perform large-scale characterization analysis of their trafﬁc, as
well as explore a public threat repository and an in-house mal-
ware database, to underlie their malicious activities. The results
expose a signiﬁcant 26 thousand compromised IoT devices “in
the wild,” with 40% being active in critical infrastructure. More
importantly, we uncover new, previously unreported malware
variants that speciﬁcally target IoT devices. Our empirical results
render a ﬁrst attempt to highlight the large-scale insecurity of the
IoT paradigm, while alarming about the rise of new generations
of IoT-centric malware-orchestrated botnets.
I. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, Internet connected devices, or what
is
currently known as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have been
widely adopted in various parts of our lives. IoT devices and
corresponding technologies facilitate efﬁcient data collection,
monitoring, and information sharing for consumers (e.g., In-
ternet routers, smart TVs, health monitoring wearables), and
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) (e.g., power utilities, manufac-
turing plants, factory automation) [1]. Despite their beneﬁts,
the always-connected nature of IoT devices and the inadequate
security measures implemented by some manufacturers [2],
have turned these devices into attractive targets for cyber
adversaries. Furthermore, IoT devices could be used as en-
ablers for orchestrating large-scale attacks towards a variety
of targets. The Mirai botnet for instance, utilized millions
of compromised IoT devices (e.g., CCTV cameras) to launch
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on several DNS
servers, resulting in service disruption for millions of Internet
users across the globe [3]. Very recently, the Reaper botnet
extended Mirai by exploiting IoT-speciﬁc vulnerabilities
rather than simply guessing credentials [4].
In order to adopt proper mitigation measures and prevent
large-scale, IoT-related cyber attacks, security researchers and
operators need to assess the magnitude of Internet-scale IoT
exploitations, in addition to characterizing and analyzing their
malicious activities. Nevertheless, given the lack of empirical
data related to IoT devices [5], in addition to their excessive
Internet-wide deployments in consumer and CPS, there is an
utmost need to explore data-driven methodologies to shed the
light and comprehend the characteristics of such compromised
IoT devices and their malicious behaviors. To address the
lack of knowledge about compromised IoT devices, there is a
need to posses an Internet-scale perspective of IoT devices
and their unsolicited activities over a period of time. This
indeed is quite challenging as it requires authorization from
different entities who own and operate these IoT devices in
their local realms. Furthermore, monitoring IoT trafﬁc would
come with underlying privacy implications. Moreover, there
are tremendous variants of IoT devices operating from all
around the world and monitoring them would require scalable
systems and signiﬁcant resources.
An effective approach to gain Internet-wide cyber threat
intelligence is to study passive measurements gathered using
designated sensors or traps that collect trafﬁc from the In-
ternet [6], [7]. These sensors collect trafﬁc targeted towards
routable, yet unused Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which
are known as darknets or network telescopes [8]. Character-
istically, trafﬁc destined to these inactive hosts is likely to
represent suspicious and unsolicited activities. Furthermore,
trafﬁc captured at the darknet mainly consists of scanning [9],
[10], backscatter trafﬁc resulting from DDoS attacks [11]–
[13], and misconﬁguration [8], [14]. Therefore, by carefully
studying darknet trafﬁc, one can generate useful insights on
a portion of unsolicited trafﬁc related to different sources
including compromised machines (e.g., malware-infected) and
victims of DDoS attacks, to name a few. To this end, in
this work, we aim at addressing the problems of inferring
Internet-scale compromised IoT devices and analyzing their
unsolicited/malicious activities by exploring auxiliary, macro-
scopic, empirical passive darknet data obtained from a large
network telescope. Speciﬁcally, we frame the contributions of
this paper as follows:
• We draw-upon close to 5TB of recent darknet data and
execute correlations with a near real-time IoT database to
empirically characterize the magnitude of Internet-scale IoT
exploitations in both, consumer and critical CPS realms. The
generated insights not only render a ﬁrst attempt ever to
empirically shed the light on the large-scale insecurity of

the IoT paradigm, but are also intended to contribute to
operational/actionable cyber security by providing Internet-
wide, IoT-tailored notiﬁcations of such exploitations, thus
permitting rapid remediation.
• We execute a ﬁrst-of-a-kind, large-scale empirical charac-
terization and analysis of IoT-centric unsolicited activities
as perceived by a large network telescope. To this end, we
uncover the nature of such trafﬁc, its sources, employed
protocols, targeted ports, upon various others. Given the
lack of IoT-speciﬁc attack signatures, we postulate that
the analyzed trafﬁc from this work could be leveraged
to design such signatures, in addition to promoting and
facilitating further IoT-tailorted forensic investigations by
making the captured unsolicited empirical trafﬁc available
to the research and operations communities at large.
• Motivated by the rise of new malware families/variants
that speciﬁcally target and exploit IoT devices such as
Persirai, Hajime and BrickerBot, to name a few,
we execute non-intrusive correlations between passive mea-
surements and malware threat intelligence to uncover new,
previously unreported malware families targeting the IoT
paradigm. In this context, we explore a publicly available
threat repository and an in-house built malware database
facilitated by instrumenting a large corpus of malware
samples in a controlled sandbox. The results not only alarm
about the severity of this malware issue in the context of the
IoT, but also paves the way for future work for addressing
the rise of IoT-centric, orchestrated botnets.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section
II reviews the recent literature on various concerned topics
to highlight the uniqueness of the proposed work. Section III
details the methodology to infer Internet-scale compromised
IoT devices by leveraging network telescopes. Section IV
performs a large-scale empirical characterization of the gener-
ated unsolicited trafﬁc from such IoT devices, putting special
emphasis on understanding the nature of the trafﬁc. Section
V explores the maliciousness of the identiﬁed IoT devices,
highlighting their involvement in various misdemeanors as
well as pinpointing several newly discovered IoT-speciﬁc
malware families. Lastly, Section VI provides a discussion on
several insightful observations and current work limitations,
while Section VII summarizes the outcomes of this work and
highlights several topics that pave the way for future work.
II. RELATED WORK
In this section, we review the literature on various concerned
topics and highlight the added-value of the proposed work.
IoT security and protocol vulnerabilities. The majority of
IoT security research work has been dedicated to synthesizing
IoT context-aware permission models. For instance, Yu et
al. [5] proposed a policy abstraction language that is capable
of capturing relevant environmental IoT contexts, security-
relevant details, and cross-device interactions,
to vet IoT-
speciﬁc network activities. Along the same research direction,
Jia et al. [15], proposed ContextIoT, a system that is capable
of supporting complex IoT-relevant permission models through
563
efﬁcient and usable program-ﬂow and runtime taint analysis.
Fernandes et al. [16] proposed a similar program-ﬂow tracking
approach that used taint arithmetic to detect policy violations
and restrict trafﬁc generated from exploited IoT application.
In the context of protocol vulnerabilities, Ur et al. [17] studied
numerous types of home automation IoT devices and unveiled
various insights with regards to the security and usability of the
implemented access control models. Ronen and Shamir [18]
demonstrated information leakage attacks by instrumenting a
set of IoT smart lights.
IoT data capturing initiatives. Given the rareness of IoT-
relevant empirical data, several recent efforts were proposed
to collect, curate, and analyze such data. The ﬁrst IoT tailored
honeypot, namely, IoTPOT, was designed and deployed by
Pa et al. [19]. IoTPOT emulates Telnet services of various
IoT devices running on different CPU architectures. In alter-
native work, Guarnizo et al. [20] presented the Scalable high-
Interaction Honeypot platform for IoT devices (SIPHON). The
authors demonstrated how by leveraging worldwide worm-
holes and few physical devices, they were able to mimic
various IoT devices on the Internet and to attract signiﬁcant
malicious trafﬁc.
Network telescope measurements and analysis. The idea
of leveraging network telescopes to monitor unused IP ad-
dresses for security purposes was ﬁrst brought to light in
the early 1990’s by Bellovin for AT&T’s Bell Labs Internet-
connected computers [21], [22]. Since then,
the focus of
network telescope studies has shifted several times, closely
following the volatile nature of new threat actors. For instance,
some of the important contributions include the discovery
of the relationship between backscattered trafﬁc and DDoS
attacks in 2001 [23], worm propagation analysis between 2003
and 2005 [24], [25], the use of time series and data mining
techniques on telescope trafﬁc in 2008 [26], the monitoring of
large-scale cyber events through telescopes in 2014 [27], and
more recently, the study of ampliﬁcation DDoS attacks using
telescope sensors [28], [29].
This paper compliments the previous contributions by ex-
tending network telescope research to particularity address the
problem of IoT security, which has yet to be attempted. To
this end, the paper develops unique data-driven methodologies
to infer and characterize compromised IoT devices,
their
unsolicited trafﬁc, and their involvement in illicit activities.
The paper also sheds light on new, previously undocumented
malware families that speciﬁcally target IoT devices.
III. IDENTIFYING UNSOLICITED INTERNET-SCALE IOT
DEVICES
We initiate our work by addressing the problems of identify-
ing and characterizing Internet-scale unsolicited IoT devices.
We refer to IoT devices as being unsolicited (or compromised)
if they were found to be generating any network packets
towards the network telescope. Please note that Section IV
will detail the nature of such unsolicited trafﬁc and provide
an in-depth characterization of its modus-operandi. We herein
initially elaborate on the employed datasets and subsequently
