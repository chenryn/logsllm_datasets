User: Please design an automated deployment process, including code management, construction, testing, release, etc., and involve the selection of automated tools.
Assistant: Automated deployment process: 1. In the code management stage, Git is selected for code management. Git has the function of a distributed version control system, which can realize multi-person collaborative development and version control. 2. In the construction phase, select Jenkins for automatic construction. Configure the code repository, build triggers, etc. in Jenkins, so that the build process can be automatically triggered every time the code is submitted. During the build process, Jenkins can automatically compile code, perform code quality checks, and automatically run test cases. 3. In the testing phase, Selenium is selected for automated testing. Selenium is a powerful automated testing framework that can simulate user operations in a browser to test website functionality. Selenium can be integrated with Jenkins to realize the test automation process. 4. In the release phase, select Docker for automatic release. Docker is a popular containerization platform that starts containers to run application instances in different environments. Containerizing applications enables rapid deployment and upgrades. Docker can be integrated with Jenkins to automate the release process. Overall process: 1. The developer submits the code to the code warehouse, and Jenkins listens to the code submission event. 2. Jenkins automatically triggers the build process, compiles code, performs code quality checks, and runs test cases. 3. If the build is successful, Jenkins triggers Selenium for automated testing. 4. If the test is successful, Jenkins triggers Docker for automatic deployment and release. 5. After the application is containerized, Docker can automatically deploy the application to each environment.
