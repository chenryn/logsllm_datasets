### 4.3.3 Serving the World from Different Metros

For this example, we examine Akamai’s deployments in six major metro areas around the world, using the 2017-09-17 snapshot of ViewA. The selected metro areas are:

- **EU-1 and EU-2**: Two major European Internet hubs with large Internet Exchange Points (IXPs).
- **US-1 and US-2**: Major metro areas on the east and west coasts of the United States, respectively, with substantial Internet infrastructure.
- **AS-1 and AS-2**: Major commercial centers and Internet hubs in Asia.

In each of these six metro areas, all four link and deployment options (onnet, PNI, IXP, and transit) are utilized, but to varying degrees. As shown in Figure 8, the different widths of the boxes represent the traffic volume, indicating that onnet and PNI combined serve the majority of the traffic in all metro areas. 

Notable differences in traffic volumes between onnet and PNI can be attributed to several factors:
- **Population Size**: Differences in the number of users in each metro area.
- **Availability, Access, and Cost of PNIs**: Varying conditions for private network interconnections.
- **ISP Peering Policies**: How ISPs in different regions view Akamai or other large Content Providers (CPs) as peering partners.

For instance, even though EU-1 and US-1 are Internet hubs with a high density of data centers, their populations relative to EU-2, US-2, or the total population in their respective countries are not large enough to justify a significant number of Type 1 deployments.

### Performance Analysis

Overall, onnet and PNI achieve the best performance in terms of Round-Trip Time (RTT), except in AS-1 where transit has a slight edge. Although transit constitutes a very small fraction of the overall traffic, its relative performance varies significantly across the three continents:
- **United States**: Transit performs similarly to PNI, likely due to the presence of remaining Tier-1 Autonomous Systems (ASes).
- **Asia**: Transit performs well due to the strong reliance on transit providers in the region.

The wide range of RTTs for IXP in EU-1 and EU-2 can be explained by the fact that Akamai’s deployments at European IXPs serve both local end-users and remote end-users in other countries connected to these IXPs.

### Summary

When examining how traffic associated with actual user requests traverses Akamai’s dense connectivity fabric, we find that approximately 90% of the overall traffic is carried by just 1% of the paths. This extreme skewness holds true for all paths seen from explicit-only, implicit-only, and combined explicit-implicit peerings. Across different global scenarios, we observe that different providers make distinct decisions about how to connect with Akamai, and these decisions significantly impact performance.

### 5. Related Work

Recent studies [42, 47] have reignited interest in the structure and operations of the serving infrastructures of large CPs like Facebook and Google, demonstrating the applicability of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) principles to public-facing networks. While these studies provide some insights into the connectivity fabric, our work offers an in-depth, first-of-its-kind account of Akamai’s connectivity fabric, a large, global-scale Content Delivery Network (CDN).

Our research also builds upon prior efforts in:
- **Mapping Large CP Infrastructures** [3, 5, 25, 43, 45, 2, 7, 9].
- **Understanding AS-Level Internet Structure and Evolution** [17, 33, 35, 41, 4, 8, 11, 13, 40].
- **Studying the Flattening of the Internet** [15, 16, 22, 30, 48].
- **Exploring CDN-ISP Collaborations** [21, 26, 38, 39].
- **Optimizing Content Delivery in a Rapidly Changing Internet** [10, 29, 36, 44, 46, 49].

Our study complements these efforts by providing a detailed account of Akamai’s connectivity fabric and illustrating how it leverages this fabric to optimize content delivery performance for end-users.

### 6. Discussion

Given the diverse and evolving nature of today’s large CP serving infrastructures, our detailed account of Akamai’s current serving infrastructure and its connectivity fabric serves as a valuable reference point for future studies. For example, future work will include studying the evolution of this large CDN’s serving infrastructure and its connectivity fabric as it expands its multi-service backbone and business model [27, 28].

Additionally, our work is a step towards understanding the serving infrastructures of other large CPs and quantifying the advantages or disadvantages of different design choices. The designs of Akamai, Google, and Facebook share similarities, such as highly distributed deployments and specialized private backbones. This raises questions about the optimality of these designs compared to alternatives, especially when the goal is cost-effective, performance-optimal, reliable, and scalable content delivery.

Finally, the shift of traffic from the "public" Internet to the "private" Internet, driven by the use of Private Network Interconnections (PNIs) and cloud-based services, is a significant trend. New methodologies are needed to study this evolving landscape, as publicly available datasets often do not capture the full picture of the private Internet.

### 7. Conclusions

Complementing recent studies on SDN-based Internet peering edge architectures, our work provides the first detailed account of the scale of the peering edge of a large CP. By examining Akamai’s serving infrastructure, we show it consists of approximately 6,100 explicit peerings and 28,500 implicit peerings. We illustrate how this dense connectivity fabric is leveraged to deliver content efficiently to ISPs worldwide.
