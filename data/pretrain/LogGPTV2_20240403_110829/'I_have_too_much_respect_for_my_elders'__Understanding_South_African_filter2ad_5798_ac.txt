who would be able to see their posts and messages. Second,
participants displayed a major lack of knowledge of available
privacy settings on the suite of Facebook social media appli-
cations and relied heavily on blocking as a privacy protection
measure or passwords on apps and phones. Third, for users
in lower-income, high-crime settings such as South Africa,
physical safety heavily inﬂuences their conceptions of, and
posting behaviors on social media. Notably, we did not ﬁnd
any strong contrasts in privacy concerns between lower and
middle income participants in our study, with two exceptions:
Firstly, only the lower-income individuals discussed using
Facebook as a data storage platform (4.3.4). Secondly, a few
of the middle-to-upper income individuals were well-versed
in online privacy matters; but, they were recruited through an
online broadband forum and research social networks which
could account for a more technically savvy sample. One or

two of these participants were aware of online tracking by
social media platforms but this was not mentioned by any low
and middle income participants. Lastly, the lack of a strong
distinction between the two groups may be due to having
fewer middle-to-upper income participants overall.
4.1 Users Privacy Perceptions
When participants were asked about their privacy on social
media, the majority spoke from the perspective of “who will
be able to see what I am doing on social media?”. The notion
of privacy from a service provider was not commonly raised
nor was there a concern about data collection for advertising
purposes; instead, participants were focused on privacy from
other people. Some (6) even went as far as to say WhatsApp
does not collect information on their users at all. Most par-
ticipants instead expressed concerns about known contacts
seeing undesirable content or whether their signiﬁcant other
would be able to access participants’ private content on their
phones and social media accounts. These privacy concerns
echo those of shared mobile phone users in low income coun-
tries such as Bangladesh [4]. Out of the group of users (11/52)
who did mention that online tracking could be an issue or that
companies have a motive to do so, only two mentioned data
collection for advertising purposes.
4.1.1 Privacy Perceived As Information Control
The majority of our participants deﬁned privacy on the Inter-
net as selectively sharing information online to regulate who
could have access to posts. That is, users in our study primar-
ily talked about privacy as ‘information control’ [14, 15].
P18: When we speak of privacy, I think of some-
thing that is secret information that one keeps to
themselves. When it comes to the Internet or social
media, sharing something with someone in [private]
means you don’t want it to be seen by other people.
Some participants mentioned privacy, but when they dis-
cussed it further they also included talk about security issues,
such as preventing hacking and securing information. For
instance, many participants spoke of their Facebook accounts
being compromised by friends or others stealing their pass-
words and posting content they felt was inappropriate or not
reﬂective of themselves.
P31: There’s no privacy on the Internet because
there are hackers out there. Even if I think no one
can see my messages, there is someone that can
see them. I’ve been hacked once and the person
who hacked my Facebook account sent a message
to my cousin saying “I’m tired of being straight
now and hiding myself. I’m going to be gay now.”
and they sent it using my account. I don’t know
this person and I even tried to stop this by changing
my password, so that’s why I’m saying there’s no

privacy on the Internet— since I was hacked before.
In other cases, participants talked about privacy being im-
portant as it could impact physical safety. For instance, one
participant mentioned the stokvel to which they belonged;
essentially an informal credit union where 10 to 12 mem-
bers contribute money that is divided on a fortnightly basis
to members [42].5. This theme of privacy being tied to high
crime was recurring amongst participants.
P38: Yes it’s important because, if we want to meet,
maybe someone who knows us sees our conversa-
tion. Say maybe a stokvel is dividing the monies
on a certain day, and the person might organize for
people to come rob us of the monies the stokvel is
dividing to its members.
The remaining ten participants expressed an uncommon
belief amongst the interviewees that there is no such thing as
privacy on the Internet or on various social networks since
they are intrinsically meant to share your information with
other users. For instance, participants often felt that sharing
more on Facebook could lead to ﬁnding jobs, lost friends or
family, and being in contact with people in nearby suburbs,
cities, or other provinces (such as ‘Tokai’ (Cape Town), ‘Jo-
hannesburg’, ‘Eastern Cape’). Only a few participants had
no conception of privacy at all (e.g., P52 deﬁned privacy as
“Whoever created social media respects other people’s views”).
Interestingly, participants often conﬂated privacy with se-
curity given their deﬁnition of privacy as access control. For
instance, many participants told us that ‘privacy was extremely
important’ to them and then proceeded to explain that their
only method for protecting both online and ofﬂine access to
their data was through the usage of a password. This is no-
table given reports of a security breach in which Facebook
was storing hundreds of millions of passwords in plaintext,
disproportionately affecting the users of their zero-rated plat-
form Facebook Lite [74], commonly used by low-income
communities such as those our participants lived in6. At least
13 participants described passwords as their only defense
against privacy breaches, best illustrated by P33’s deﬁnition
of managing privacy on the Internet:
P33: I think it means being safe from other people
because they can use your proﬁle picture to commit
fraud and ruin your life, so I think that is where the
settings come in.
I: How do you keep your privacy on social media
and make sure that it doesn’t happen to you?
P33: I keep my passwords to myself and I don’t
share them with anyone.
5Every month a different member gets the pot of money and this member
rotates so that everybody has a turn to get the money.
6We were unable to discern when participants were discussing Facebook
versus Facebook Lite on Free Basics. We can report that more than 20 of our
participants used Facebook Lite at least some of the time.
4.1.2 Presentation of Self and Privacy from Elders
Participants expressed speciﬁc privacy concerns about how
they presented themselves to others [23]. This concern about
representing oneself to ones family members and relatives,
and in particular, being respectful of, and maintaining privacy
from ‘elders’ was repeated by participants. Our participants
often spoke of a worry that family members, friends, potential
employers, or business partners would see inappropriate or
less desirable content from them. For example, one individual,
P35, was worried that his new girlfriend would be able to see
the old pictures with his ex-girlfriend that he had posted on
Facebook. He feared her seeing the ‘wild life’ he had lived be-
fore. Similarly, P18 said that he stopped using Facebook after
old pictures that he had posted on Facebook were ‘stolen’ and
then shared in a WhatsApp group to ‘mock’ him. A signiﬁcant
portion of participants talked about hiding information from
‘elders’, people at ‘church’, their ‘community’ or the ‘village’
they had moved from to ensure they were not representing
themselves in a bad light, because they felt judged. In one
example, a female participant mentioned she worried about
posting photos wearing tights because this was frowned upon
for a ‘married woman’. In another case, P18 said:
I have too much respect for my elders and I do not
want them to see pictures of me and my boyfriend
all over social media.
Participants told us that they tried to manage their privacy
while still giving access to people that they felt could offer
them opportunities such as jobs. A participant talking about
this tension explained:
P26: Parents, people that I usually work with. So
I make sure that they don’t see some stuff and
also some family members who are my contacts
on WhatsApp. So I make sure they don’t see. More
so the people who give me opportunities or people
that I can beneﬁt from are the ones that I make sure
don’t see some things.
In many cases, participants spoke of self-censoring their
posts by editing photos, avoiding posting about ‘personal is-
sues’ or relationships or in some cases, posting or ‘ranting’
about race which is a hot-button issue in South Africa to main-
tain their desired presentation of self. Only one or two of the
middle income participants mentioned being concerned about
posting photos with their ‘ID number’ or identity number, the
unique identiﬁer for each citizen in the country.
4.1.3 WhatsApp Seen As More Private Than Facebook
Many participants highlighted what they valued in privacy
settings by comparing WhatsApp and Facebook. Most of our
participants tended to describe their level of privacy concerns
in terms of how much they trust the people they interact with
or how others behave on a particular social media platform
as opposed to how much they trust the platform providers.
USENIX Association
29th USENIX Security Symposium    1955
Participants told us that because more users have access to
posted material on Facebook, they tended to trust Facebook
less than WhatsApp. The number of people who have access
to the conversations or statuses strongly impacted their per-
ception of platform privacy. Participants felt that Facebook is
a more public facing platform. For instance, one participant
purposefully set his Facebook account settings to "public" so
that long lost friends would be able to ﬁnd him if necessary.
The following quote illustrates this belief:
P3: All the things one posts on Facebook are avail-
able for the whole world to see. I don’t post things
that I think will backﬁre on my image and name
one day. Just the fact that everyone and anyone can
see other people’s posts makes me not trust the app.
I: Are you in control of that? Are you able to decide
who can see what you posted or not?
P3: No, I am not in control. I think that even people
I don’t know can see my posts. I can post personal
things on WhatsApp because I know the people
who will see my status updates, whereas on Face-
book, I am aware that even people I don’t know can
see all of my posts.
While the majority of users reported that they felt uncom-
fortable being added by users on Facebook whom they did not
know personally, many of them added these individuals any-
ways. Often, participants did so because they felt that adding
strangers might lead to new job opportunities or thought it
would be ‘rude not to add them.’
Contrarily, participants explained that on WhatsApp, some-
one must have your number for them to access your content.
This made participants feel that it is a more personal social
media platform [32]. Because this is the default way of adding
contacts, participants often had different types of relationships
with their contacts on WhatsApp compared to their contacts
on other platforms such as Facebook. Generally speaking, par-
ticipants described that they used WhatsApp to communicate
with close friends and family, describing it as ‘private’, and
used Facebook to stay in touch with acquaintances.
P24: Yeah. I think on Facebook, I’ll add most peo-
ple I know. With WhatsApp, it’s more a personal
thing, you know? People you chat with regularly.
The intimate nature of WhatsApp gave many users a sense
of privacy because conversations can be between fewer people
rather than a public post. Participants’ praise of WhatsApp’s
privacy levels when discussing group messages on WhatsApp
was much more reserved. For instance, participants mentioned
that in group chats, they did not necessarily know every in-
dividual in the group chat, demonstrating that the ‘intimacy’
factor inﬂuenced their conceptions of how private the platform
is. Furthermore, on WhatsApp, participants described receiv-
ing more responses to their status messages, which causes
them to post on WhatsApp more often. (A status message on
WhatsApp is very similar to a story on Instagram or Face-
book. It is an ephemeral posting, generally a picture or video,
that will be visible to all of the person’s contacts by default.)
Participants commented on how more posts then lead to more
status views by their friends. The high volume of responses
on WhatsApp, similar to the one on one nature of the con-
versations, created a feeling of intimacy between a user and
their contacts. Participant P21, who reporting using Instagram,
Facebook, and WhatsApp regularly, said he feels a sense of
privacy on WhatsApp because you can delete a message from
both sides of the conversation, giving them control over what
the other person in the conversation sees as well7.
P21: On WhatsApp you can actually restrict who
can see your proﬁle, and who you don’t want to
see it. And when you type and send something by
accident, you can delete it on their side of the chat.
4.2 Current Privacy Behaviors
According to an earlier study done in Ghana, knowledge of
privacy settings is hugely lacking, with only 25.9% of re-
spondents reporting having used Facebook privacy settings
before [13] — a nominal rate considering the extremely com-
mon usage of Facebook. Our participants reported similar
usage rates for privacy settings. They often were unaware
that privacy settings exist on social media and did not speciﬁc
exactly which options they typically use in privacy settings,
even if the topic came up.
4.2.1 Unaware Of Or How To Use Most Privacy Set-
tings
In our study, at least 30 participants explicitly stated that they
do not use or do not know how to use most privacy settings
for their social media accounts. Also, unlike in similar set-
tings [3], our participants had a far less nuanced understanding
and use of other social media privacy settings such as chang-
ing who could see a post, creating lists of friends, changing
who can see what is posted on a ‘wall’, who can see tagged
photos, and so forth. Some participants did mention limiting
their Facebook proﬁles to be seen by friends only and talked
about public versus private posts but they were in the minority.
At least one person mentioned ‘unfriending’ someone. Partic-
ipants also felt a tension between wanting to be ‘social’ and
accessible to people who could give them opportunities and
avoiding being too ‘private’. Nearly every time a participant
expressed awareness of these privacy settings, they followed
by explaining they had an inability to actually access the pri-
vacy settings, often mentioning data costs which we took to be
the limiting factor. Earlier studies suggest users often follow
their friend’s privacy tendencies on Facebook [33]. Somewhat
relatedly, in our study, we found that 11 participants who
did know about privacy settings had often discovered these
settings by either word of mouth or via a friend informing

them of their existence or demonstrating how to use a particu-
lar control. These participants explained that they leveraged
their friend’s knowledge to prevent stalkers from seeing their
proﬁle and status on social media.
P33: I would hear from my friends that you can
go and follow these steps to achieve this private
setting on your Facebook or WhatsApp to avoid
being stalked on your social media. And I would
listen and apply the advice.
Others wanted to prevent their family from seeing posts
with them doing things not in line with their family’s tradi-
tional values or that would be disrespectful to ‘elders’, but
did not know how to do so until they were shown by friends.
P29: My one cousin showed me, there is an option
there that lets you choose who can see your status.
I don’t know how she does it. She is coming on
Friday, I will ask her to show me again.
In fewer cases, participants found the settings on their own,
such as P49, who spoke of altering settings to protect her
privacy from elders:
P49: Yes, because there are elders on my What-
sApp so I just rather not post or I hide the post. For
example, if I take a picture somewhere and I am
with my friends and there is alcohol in the shot. I
learned this from just ﬁddling with my phone. No
one told me about it.
Without knowing the settings, others resorted to opening
