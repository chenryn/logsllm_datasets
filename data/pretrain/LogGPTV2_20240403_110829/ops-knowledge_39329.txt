User: What is the difference between interface testing and integration testing? How should a testing method be chosen during development?
Assistant: The main difference between interface testing and integration testing is that the test objects are different. Interface testing is a test for the communication interface between various components/modules in the application, mainly testing the transmission and processing of data, such as verifying requests and responses, verifying data format and content, etc.; while integration testing is for the entire application Test, mainly to test the integration and collaboration between different modules, to verify the consistency, correctness and usability of the application in different links. In the selection of test methods, it needs to be carried out according to the actual situation. Generally speaking, at the beginning of application design and development, interface testing should be carried out to verify the data transfer and processing between modules, and the application should be continuously optimized by feedback and modification of test cases. With the continuous deepening of development, integration testing is required to verify whether the functions and performance of the entire application meet expectations, and on this basis, other testing activities such as system testing and performance testing are carried out. Therefore, in the development process, it is necessary to select different test methods for testing in due course according to the requirements and progress.
