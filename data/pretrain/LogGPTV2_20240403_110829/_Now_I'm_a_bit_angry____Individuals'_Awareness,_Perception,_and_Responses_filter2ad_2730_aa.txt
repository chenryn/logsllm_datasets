Abstract
Despite the prevalence of data breaches, there is a limited
understanding of individuals’ awareness, perception, and re-
sponses to breaches that affect them. We provide novel in-
sights into this topic through an online study (n=413) in which
we presented participants with up to three data breaches that
had exposed their email addresses and other personal infor-
mation. Overall, 73% of participants were affected by at least
one breach, 5.36 breaches on average. Many participants at-
tributed the cause of being affected by a breach to their poor
email and security practices; only 14% correctly attributed
the cause to external factors such as breached organizations
and hackers. Participants were unaware of 74% of displayed
breaches and expressed various emotions when learning about
them. While some reported intending to take action, most par-
ticipants believed the breach would not impact them. Our
ﬁndings underline the need for user-friendly tools to improve
consumers’ resilience against breaches and accountability for
breached organizations to provide more proactive post-breach
communications and mitigations.
1 Introduction
Data breaches, the disclosure of sensitive personal informa-
tion to unauthorized parties, are on the rise [30, 63]. The aver-
age user has accounts with 191 online services [18]. Mean-
while, the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) breach database lists
over 480 breached online services and over 10M compro-
mised accounts [29]. The Identity Theft Resource Center
reported 1,108 breaches that occurred in the United States
in 2019, which exposed over 164M sensitive records [30].
The sheer number of breaches makes it challenging to track
the total number of records involved [35] and notify affected
consumers [83]. Facing a plethora of data breaches [30, 63],
consumers rarely take recommended protective measures in
response [1, 31, 99].
∗Peter Mayer and Yixin Zou contributed equally to this research.
Prior work has primarily studied consumers’ general re-
actions to data breaches [1, 31, 37] or has focused on indi-
vidual breaches in isolation such as the Equifax [99] and
Target breaches [27, 41]. By contrast, we conducted an on-
line study (n=413) in which we leveraged the HIBP database
to present participants with, and have them reﬂect on, spe-
ciﬁc data breaches that had exposed their email address and
other personal information. With this novel approach, we gath-
ered 792 detailed breach-speciﬁc responses (up to three per
participant), covering 189 unique breaches and 66 different
exposed data types. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses
contribute valuable insights into individuals’ awareness, per-
ception, and responses to speciﬁc data breaches that affected
them. We further tease out interactions between individuals’
awareness, concern, and self-reported action. Our ﬁndings
answer the following research questions:
RQ1 [Breach status] What factors inﬂuence the likelihood
that an email address is involved in a data breach?
Overall, 73% of our participants experienced at least one
breach and 5.36 breaches on average. An email address’s
likelihood of being exposed in a breach signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with the email account’s age and utilization.
RQ2 [Perception] What do participants perceive as the
causes of being involved in data breaches and related impacts,
and to what extent do their perceptions align with reality?
Only 14% of our participants accurately attributed the cause
of being affected by a breach to external factors such as
breached organizations and hackers. Others blamed their
email or security behaviors for making themselves a victim
or viewed breaches as inevitable. Most participants expected
little impact from shown breaches despite realizing certain
risks.
RQ3
awareness of data breaches that affected them?
Participants were unaware of most data breaches presented
(74%). Those who knew they were affected by a speciﬁc
breach had primarily learned about it from the breached
[Awareness] What factors inﬂuence participants’

organization or third-party services. Participants were more
likely to be aware of older rather than recent breaches.
RQ4 [Emotional response] What are participants’ emotional
responses to data breaches that affected them?
Most participants rated their concern regarding breaches as
low (56% slightly/somewhat concerned, 19% no concern).
Certain breached data types such as physical address and
password raised more concern than others. Participants ex-
pressed emotions ranging from upset, angry, annoyed, frus-
trated, surprised (or not) to violated and fatigued.
RQ5 [Behavioral response] What factors inﬂuence partici-
pants’ likelihood to take action in response to data breaches
that affected them?
Participants reported having already or being very likely to
change their passwords and review credit reports/ﬁnancial
statements in response to over 50% of shown breaches. Par-
ticipants were more likely to take action with increased
concern and prior awareness, suggesting that better commu-
nication about breaches could increase individuals’ tendency
to take protective actions.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate the need for more proactive com-
munications of data breaches and stronger protections for
affected individuals. Rather than burdening consumers to take
action, breached organizations should be held responsible
for increasing awareness and providing appropriate mitiga-
tions. Furthermore, our ﬁndings highlight the need for usable
privacy tools to help affected individuals be more resilient
against future breaches.
2 Background and Related Work
Data breaches. Data breaches have multifaceted conse-
quences. Breached organizations can bear substantial costs
to repair the aftermath, including patching system vulnera-
bilities, compensations to affected individuals, and resolving
potential lawsuits [71, 72]. There are also invisible and hard-
to-measure costs in rebuilding the breached organization’s
reputation [39, 94] and affected individuals’ trust [1, 12, 49].
For affected individuals, exposed data puts them at risk of
account compromise [18, 66, 77, 87], phishing [59], and iden-
tity theft [70, 74, 81]. Though it may take years before leaked
data is misused, the harm can be profound when it happens.
For instance, victims of identity theft may have ruined credit
reports or have to ﬁle for bankruptcy due to abuse of credit [5].
Identity theft is also traumatizing: in a 2017 survey by the
Identity Theft Resource Center [43], 77% of respondents re-
ported increased stress levels, and 55% reported increased
fatigue or decreased energy. Thus, some researchers [16, 81]
have argued that data breaches cause compensable harms
due to the substantial risk of future ﬁnancial injury and the
emotional distress imposed on victims.
Breached organizations are often legally required to notify
affected victims [22, 61] and offer compensations such as dis-
counts [13] or free credit/identity monitoring [76]. Services
like HIBP [29] and Firefox Monitor [53] examine third-party
breach reports and notify signed-up users. Some companies
automatically reset passwords for users whose credentials ap-
peared in password dumps [26, 95]. Additional measures for
victims include two-factor authentication (2FA) that increases
the difﬁculty of misusing leaked credentials and warnings
that ﬂag social engineering and phishing attacks [46,60]. Nev-
ertheless, no solution is perfect: attackers can bypass 2FA
without obtaining the secondary token [19, 32], and phishing
warnings have low adherence rates [3, 4, 21].
Security mental models and behaviors. How individu-
als perceive the causes and impacts of data breaches relates
to mental models of security and privacy. Mental models —
an individual’s internalized representation of how a system
works [56] — have been studied for computer security [91],
security warnings [9], smart home security [97], and the Inter-
net [36]. Respective studies consistently ﬁnd that unawareness
and misconceptions of security risks create hurdles for adopt-
ing effective mitigation strategies. Even when individuals
correctly assess risks, they may still not react accordingly due
to bounded rationality and cognitive biases [2] or not having
experienced negative consequences [100].
We investigate two aspects that may impact how individu-
als respond to data breaches: awareness, i.e., whether and how
individuals learn about a breach, and perception regarding a
breach’s potential causes and impacts. For awareness, prior
research has documented various channels individuals lever-
age to learn about security advice, including media, peers,
family, workplace, and service providers [15, 65, 67]. For
data breaches speciﬁcally, respondents of RAND’s 2016 US
national survey [1] reported ﬁrst learning of a breach from
the breached organization’s notiﬁcation (56%), media reports
(28%), or third-parties (16%). Additionally, prior research has
shown that consumers understand the potential impacts of
data breaches, such as identity theft and personal information
leakage [31,37,99]. Our study complements these ﬁndings by
prompting participants to reﬂect on both causes and impacts
of speciﬁc breaches that affected them, providing insights on
how these perceptions link to their emotions and behaviors.
Consumer reactions to data breaches. Data breach vic-
tims are advised to take a range of actions depending on the
information exposed [85,86,90], such as changing passwords
if account credentials are exposed or requesting new cards
and reviewing statements if ﬁnancial information is exposed.
In the US, victims are further urged to place a credit freeze,
check credit reports, and ﬁle taxes early if their Social Security
number (SSN) is exposed [47, 84, 85].
Nevertheless, studies on breaches in general [1, 31, 37]
and on speciﬁc breaches [27, 41, 88, 99] show that con-

sumers rarely take recommended protective measures in re-
sponse [31, 99, 100]. While consumers report increased con-
cern about identity theft [6, 31] and diminished trust in the
breached organization [12, 55], such risk perception and at-
titudinal change often do not result in action. Consumers
tend to accept compensations provided by the breached or-
ganization [1, 51] but do not go further; they continue using
existing credit cards [51] and the same password for different
accounts [25], thereby fueling credential stufﬁng attacks that
cause account compromises [30].
Several studies have examined the determinants of con-
sumers’ behavioral reactions to data breaches: knowledge
of available measures [99], perception of clear evidence in-
dicating being affected [50], cognitive biases [99], peer in-
ﬂuence [14, 41], and media coverage [15]. Tech-savvy and
non-tech-savvy individuals also differ in their needs for guid-
ance related to mitigating actions [6]. Furthermore, breach
notiﬁcations to victims are often ambiguous in communicat-
ing risks and priority among recommended actions [8, 89, 98].
These issues, coupled with the overwhelming amount of se-
curity advice for end-users [68, 69], may pose challenges for
affected individuals to act on provided advice.
Methodologically, prior work primarily asked participants
to recall past experiences with generic breaches [1, 31] or de-
scribe intended reactions in hypothetical scenarios [28,37]. By
contrast, we apply a novel approach to examine participants’
responses to speciﬁc breaches that exposed their information.
Our study covers a multitude of breaches varying in size and
types of exposed information rather than one breach as a case
study [27, 51, 88, 99]. Our approach increases ecological va-
lidity and mitigates recall bias as participants are confronted
with breaches that affect them. Similar reﬂection studies have
yielded insights into users’ attitudes and behaviors in other
contexts, such as password creation behaviors [58, 92] and
reactions to online tracking [93] or advertising inference [64].
3 Method
Our study addresses our ﬁve research questions as follows. To
identify what factors inﬂuence an email address’s likelihood
of being involved in a breach (RQ1), we collected details
about participants’ email usage and demographics. To identify
perceptions regarding the causes of being involved in a breach
and related consequences (RQ2), we asked participants to
speculate why their email address may have or have not been
involved in any data breaches, and any associated impacts
they expect or have experienced. For each speciﬁc breach,
we asked participants if they were previously aware of it and,
if so, how (RQ3). To assess emotional responses, we asked
participants to describe how they feel about the breach and
rate their concern (RQ4). We further asked participants to
self-report what they did in response to the breach and rate
the likelihood of taking (or having taken) ten provided actions
(RQ5). We ran regression models to examine the relationship
between email usage, breached data types, awareness, concern,
and behavioral reactions. Our study was approved by our
Institutional Review Boards (IRB).
3.1 Survey Instrument
As we were motivated to understand participants’ responses
to real-world breaches at scale, we conducted an online sur-
vey with data pulled from Have I Been Pwned (HIBP).1 We
built a survey platform which queried the HIBP web service
API using email addresses provided by study participants. To
protect participants’ conﬁdentiality, we only maintained email
addresses in ephemeral memory to query HIBP. At no point
did we store participants’ email addresses. We then used the
query results, i.e., the breaches in which a participant’s email
address was exposed, to drive the remainder of the survey.
The survey consisted of three main parts (see Appendix A).
Part 1: Email address-related questions. After consent-
ing, we asked participants for their most commonly used email
address. We clearly noted that the email address will only
be used to query HIBP and that we will never see it (Ap-
pendix A.2). Once a participant entered an email address, we
asked a few questions about it. Participants who indicated that
the email address belonged to someone else or was fabricated
were given the option to enter a different email address or
leave the study. Next, we asked participants about their email
habits as a potential inﬂuencing factor of the email’s involve-
ment in breaches (RQ1). This included frequency of checking
their email, primary use of the account (professional/personal
correspondence or account creation), how long it has been
used, and the number of other email accounts the participant
used. We then used the provided email address to query HIBP.
Part 2: Breach-related questions. We next informed par-
ticipants whether their email address was exposed in any data
breaches without stating the speciﬁc number or giving more
details. To answer RQ2, we asked participants to speculate
why their email address was or was not part of data breaches.
Participants whose email address was not part of any breach
were given the opportunity to enter a different email address
until a provided email address had associated breaches. If they
did not provide another email, they continued with part 3.
We randomly selected up to three breaches, displayed one
by one, to ask breach-related questions while limiting poten-
tial fatigue. We displayed a breach’s description, logo, name,
and types of compromised data as provided by HIBP (Fig-
ure 1). We explicitly stated that these were actual breaches
(see Appendix A), and no participants doubted the validity of
shown breaches in their qualitative responses. For each breach,
we asked about participants’ awareness (RQ3), emotional re-
sponse (RQ4), and actions taken or intended to take (RQ5).

Figure 1: Sample breach information shown to participants.
For emotional response, participants provided open-ended
responses, then rated their concern level on a 5-point Likert
scale regarding the breach in general and for each type of
exposed data. For behavioral response, participants described
their reactions (open-ended) before rating their intention to
take (or whether they had taken) ten provided actions sourced
from prior work [85, 86, 90]. The respective breach infor-
mation was visible at the top of the page when participants
answered all these questions.
Part 3: Demographics, attention check, and debrief. We
collected participants’ demographics including age, gender,
education, whether they had a background in IT or law, and
household income. We also included two attention check
questions: one asking them to identify the name of a breach
shown during the study (only for participants whose email
address was part of at least one breach), and a generic attention
check (see Appendix A.4). Finally, we showed participants
