User: I am using python 3.4 at win-8. I want to obtain .exe program  from python code. I learned that it can be done by cx_Freeze.
In MS-DOS command line, I wrote pip install cx_Freeze to set up cx_Freeze. It is installed but it is not working. 
(When I wrote cxfreeze to command line, I get this warning:C:\Users\USER>cxfreeze
'cxfreeze' is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.)
(I also added location of cxfreeze to "PATH" by environment variables)
Any help would be appriciated thanks.
Assistant: Make sure the Version of Python is correct, if you have more than one version on your computer, just simply type "python" in console to check the version of your python. I just had this problem earlier.
