**User:**

I am using Python 3.4 on Windows 8 and would like to convert my Python code into an executable (.exe) file. I understand that this can be achieved using `cx_Freeze`. I installed `cx_Freeze` via the command line by running `pip install cx_Freeze`, but it does not seem to be working. When I type `cxfreeze` in the command line, I receive the following warning:

```
C:\Users\USER>cxfreeze
'cxfreeze' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

I have also added the location of `cxfreeze` to the system's `PATH` environment variable. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Thank you for providing the details. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Verify Python Version:**
   - Ensure that you are using the correct version of Python. If you have multiple versions of Python installed, you can check the active version by typing `python --version` in the command prompt.

2. **Check Installation:**
   - Verify that `cx_Freeze` is installed correctly. You can do this by running `pip show cx_Freeze` in the command prompt. This will display information about the `cx_Freeze` package if it is installed.

3. **Script Location:**
   - The `cxfreeze` script might not be in your `PATH`. To find the location of the `cxfreeze` script, navigate to your Python's `Scripts` directory. For example, if you are using Python 3.4, the path might be something like `C:\Python34\Scripts`.

4. **Add to PATH:**
   - Ensure that the `Scripts` directory (e.g., `C:\Python34\Scripts`) is included in your system's `PATH` environment variable. You can add it by following these steps:
     1. Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
     2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
     3. In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
     4. In the Environment Variables window, find the `Path` variable in the "System variables" section and select it.
     5. Click "Edit" and add the path to the `Scripts` directory (e.g., `C:\Python34\Scripts`).
     6. Click "OK" to close all windows and apply the changes.

5. **Restart Command Prompt:**
   - After updating the `PATH`, restart the command prompt to ensure the changes take effect.

6. **Test the Installation:**
   - Open a new command prompt and type `cxfreeze --version` to check if `cxfreeze` is now recognized and its version is displayed.
