Certainly! Here is an optimized version of the text:

```julia
julia> using LinearAlgebra

julia> LinearAlgebra.hello()
ERROR: UndefVarError: hello not defined
Stacktrace:
 [1] getproperty(x::Module, f::Symbol)
   @ Base ./Base.jl:26
 [2] top-level scope
   @ REPL[2]:1
```

The error message could be more informative if it were displayed as follows:

```
ERROR: UndefVarError: no binding for `hello` defined in module `LinearAlgebra`
```

This would make it clearer that the `hello` function is not defined within the `LinearAlgebra` module.
