### Title: BlackHat US-22: Framed by an Elephant â€“ An APT Fabricating Evidence to Imprison Opponents

It's easy to overlook the human toll of state-sponsored cyber threats that operate with impunity. While we often focus on espionage, intellectual property theft, or financial gain as the primary objectives of these operations, a far more insidious motivation often goes unnoticed: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) fabricating evidence to frame and imprison vulnerable opponents.

This talk delves into the activities of ModifiedElephant, a threat actor that has been operating for at least a decade and has ties to the commercial surveillance industry. We will explore how ModifiedElephant has incriminated activists, many of whom remain in prison despite forensic reports proving that the evidence was planted. Furthermore, we will highlight how multiple regional threat actors targeted these same victims before their arrests, creating a cluster of activity that represents a critically underreported dimension of how some governments abuse technology to silence critics.

Our goal is to raise awareness about this issue and inspire threat researchers to take action against such abuses.
