**ATT&CK ID:** C0014  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operation Wocao

During Operation Wocao, the threat actors systematically erased evidence of their activities. They first overwrote a file using the following command:

```cmd
/c cd /d c:\windows\temp\ & copy \\\c$\windows\system32\devmgr.dll \\\c$\windows\temp\LMAKSW.ps1 /y
```

Subsequently, they deleted the overwritten file with the following command:

```cmd
/c cd /d c:\windows\temp\ & del \\\c$\windows\temp\LMAKSW.ps1
```

This sequence of actions helped the threat actors to cover their tracks and avoid detection.
