I have recently begun the process of migrating an application to Next.js v5, and I am proceeding with this migration in incremental steps. After completing the transition for a single page, I attempted to verify it in production mode by running the build process using the following commands: `NODE_ENV=production next build && NODE_ENV=production next export`. 

While the `styles.css` file is correctly generated and saved in the `./.next/static/styles.css` directory, it is not included in the exported build located in the `./out/**` directory. This omission results in 404 errors when the stylesheet is requested.

### Expected Behavior
The `styles.css` file should be included in the exported build.

### Current Behavior
The `styles.css` file is not included in the exported build.

### Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
1. Add `@zeit/next-css` to your `next.config.js`.
2. Import a `.css` file.
3. Run `next build`.
4. Run `next export`.
5. Serve the `./out` directory using a local server, e.g., `serve ./out`.
6. Attempt to access the stylesheet via `curl http://localhost:3000/_next/static/style.css` and observe the 404 error.

### Context
This issue has prevented me from fully migrating to Next.js v5.

### Your Environment
- **Next.js Version:** 5
- **Node.js Version:** 8
