I've just started moving an app over to Next v5. I'm doing this in small
chunks, and have just finished a page. In order to verify it in production-
mode, I ran the build (`NODE_ENV=production next build && NODE_ENV=production
next export`). The `styles.css` file is correctly build/saved to
`./.next/static/styles.css`, but it is _not_ included in the exported build
(`./out/**`).
This results in 404s when requesting the stylesheet.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The stylesheet should be included in the exported build.
## Current Behavior
The stylesheet is not included in the exported build.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Add `@zeit/next-css` to your `next.config.js`
  2. Import a .css file
  3. Run `next build`
  4. Run `next export`
  5. Run `serve ./out`
  6. Run `curl http://localhost:3000/_next/static/style.css` to see the 404
## Context
This has prevented me from migrating to Next v5.
