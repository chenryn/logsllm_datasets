# Environment
    Windows build number:  Win32NT             10.0.18362.0 Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.18362.0
    Any other software?
    Windows Terminal built from git clone 9/92019.  Have noticed it in the past.
# Steps to reproduce
Build Microsoft Terminal  
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Terminal.git  
cd Terminal  
git submodule update --init --recursive  
nuget restore OpenConsole.sln  
Open VS2019  
Set build to release X64  
Build Solution  
Deploy Solution
Launch Terminal from Start menu.
# Expected behavior
At this point the build directory should be able to be deleted. Solution was
deployed. Build dirs should not be used
# Actual behavior
Build dir tree is still used by running deployed release build app  
Terminal\src\cascadia\CascadiaPackage\bin\x64\Release\AppX  
Files opened by running "Windows Terminal.exe" verified by Process Explorer.
Not sure why it does this, but it shouldn't
