**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the applicability of packet sampling techniques to flow-based accounting. We first present a theoretical analysis to show how the achievable accuracy depends on sampling techniques, parameters, and traffic characteristics. Next, we conduct empirical studies to determine the accuracy achieved with typical flow characteristics using real traffic traces from three different networks. Finally, we illustrate how to support sampling-based accounting by providing an accuracy statement along with the measured data. We identify the necessary information and demonstrate how an accuracy assessment can be approximated using IPFIX (IP Flow Information Export) protocol information elements.

## 1. Introduction

Packet sampling aims to reduce measurement costs by estimating metrics of interest from a subset of data. It is crucial to evaluate the extent of potential estimation errors, especially in accounting where measurement results map to monetary values. The achievable accuracy typically depends on the characteristics of the network traffic. Given the dynamic nature of network traffic, providing an up-to-date accuracy assessment is non-trivial and must be derived from limited information available after the sampling process. This assessment must be calculated per flow and continuously updated.

Basic packet selection methods are currently standardized in the IETF PSAMP group [6]. A flow sampling scheme for accounting is introduced in [1]. Techniques such as Sample and Hold [2], Shared-state Sampling (S3) [3], and Runs-Based Traffic Estimator (RATE) [4] bias the selection process towards large flows to reduce resource consumption for flow caching and flow record transfer. This is beneficial for accounting because a few large flows often contribute significantly to the overall traffic volume. However, these approaches require packet classification into flows before or during the sampling process. In contrast, we investigate the effects of packet sampling applied before flow classification, which reduces the workload on routers [5]. We compare the achievable accuracy for basic PSAMP schemes and a stratified method used in Cisco NetFlow to accounting requirements, and show how the accuracy can be approximated using IPFIX information elements [11].

## 2. Flow Accounting Requirements

The accuracy of an estimate is assessed by its bias and precision. For accounting, unbiased estimates are preferred, meaning the expectation of the estimated values should equal the true value. Precision is derived from the variance (or its square root, the standard error) of the estimate and indicates the spread of estimated values from sample runs. The higher the standard error, the lower the precision. An accuracy statement can be presented to customers as a confidence interval, with confidence boundaries defining the range within which the true value should lie. The confidence level (CL) gives the probability that the true value lies within this range. From this, we can derive a maximum standard error that should not be exceeded if a given accuracy is required.

Table 1 shows the maximum relative standard error for different accuracy requirements for a normally distributed estimate.

## 3. Theoretical Accuracy Assessment

We provide a theoretical assessment of bias and precision by deriving formulas for the expectation and standard error for various sampling schemes. While we also provide formulas for sampling after classification, our focus is on sampling before classification, which is more complex but saves classification effort and is used in NetFlow.

### 3.1. Accuracy Assessment for n-out-of-N Sampling

In n-out-of-N sampling, exactly n elements are selected from a population of N elements [6]. If there is only one flow (N = Nf) in the traffic mix or if sampling is applied after classification, the number of packets per flow (Nf) is known. The number of selected packets (nf) can be set per flow and is also known.

The estimate \(\hat{Sum}_f\) for the number of bytes in flow f can be calculated from the packet sizes \(x_{i,f}\) of the selected packets, by extrapolating with nf and Nf. The expected bias is zero. The standard error can be calculated using the standard formula for an n-out-of-N selection [9] from sampling parameters and packet size variance \(\sigma^2_{x_f}\).

\[
\hat{Sum}_f = \frac{N_f}{n_f} \sum_{i=1}^{n_f} x_{i,f}
\]

\[
\text{StdErr}(\hat{Sum}_f) = \left| \sqrt{\frac{N_f - n_f}{n_f}} \cdot \sigma_{x_f} \right|
\]

If sampling is applied before classification, Nf and nf are unknown, and extrapolation must be done with the overall population N and sample size n.

\[
\hat{Sum}_f = \frac{N}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i,f}
\]

Here, the number of packets from flow f in the sample (nf) varies for each sampling run and must be considered as a random variable. The estimate contains two random variables, nf and \(x_{i,f}\). To assess the estimation quality, we need to calculate the expectation and variance of a sum of random variables, where the number of addends itself is a random variable. We model nf as a discrete random variable with a binomial distribution B(n, Nf/N). The mean \(\mu_{x_f}\) and variance \(\sigma^2_{x_f}\) of all packet sizes in flow f in the population are denoted by \(\mu_{x_f}\) and \(\sigma^2_{x_f}\), respectively. Since we apply a random selection, the \(x_{i,f}\) are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

With the assumption of the binomial distribution for nf and independence for the \(x_{i,f}\), we derive the following formulas for the expectation and variance of the estimated sum for flow f (see appendix):

\[
E[\hat{Sum}_f] = \mu_{x_f} \cdot N_f
\]

\[
\text{Var}(\hat{Sum}_f) = \frac{N_f (N - N_f)}{n} \left( \sigma^2_{x_f} + \mu_{x_f}^2 \right)
\]

The expectation equals the real volume, i.e., the estimation is unbiased. The variance of the estimated flow volume, and thus the expected accuracy of the estimation, depends on the parameters n, N, Nf, \(\mu_{x_f}\), and \(\sigma^2_{x_f}\). Nf denotes the number of packets in the population that belong to flow f, and \(\mu_{x_f}\) and \(\sigma^2_{x_f}\) depend on the packet size distribution in flow f. Taking the square root of the variance gives the absolute standard error:

\[
\text{StdErr}(\hat{Sum}_f) = \sqrt{\frac{N_f (N - N_f)}{n} \left( \sigma^2_{x_f} + \mu_{x_f}^2 \right)}
\]

A division by the flow volume provides the relative standard error (see appendix).

### 3.2. Stratified Sampling

Stratified sampling divides the population into subintervals (strata) and applies sampling within each stratum. The accuracy depends on the number of strata L and the packet size variances \(\sigma^2_{x_l}\) in the subintervals. If the packets in the measurement interval belong to different flows (Nf < N), the calculation of the standard error becomes more complex because the variances must be calculated per stratum. The standard error now depends on the per-flow characteristics (number of packets Kf, packet size variance \(\sigma^2_{x_f,l}\), and mean \(\mu_{x_f,l}\)) within each subinterval.

\[
\text{StdErr}(\hat{Sum}_{\text{strat},f}) = \sqrt{\sum_{l=1}^{L} \left( \frac{K_{f,l}}{K} \cdot \left( \sigma^2_{x_f,l} + \mu_{x_f,l}^2 \right) \right)}
\]

In summary, the accuracy of packet sampling for flow accounting depends on the sampling technique, parameters, and traffic characteristics. By providing an accuracy statement and using IPFIX information elements, we can support sampling-based accounting and ensure reliable measurements.
