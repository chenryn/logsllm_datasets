**ATT&CK ID:** T1546.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Screensaver

Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable period of user inactivity and are typically Portable Executable (PE) files with a `.scr` file extension. On Windows systems, the screensaver application `scrnsave.scr` is located in the following directories:
- `C:\Windows\System32\`
- `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\` (on 64-bit Windows systems)

Additionally, base Windows installations include several default screensavers, which can also be found in these directories.

By modifying or replacing existing screensavers with malicious versions, adversaries can ensure that their code executes when the system becomes idle, thus maintaining persistent access to the target system.
