User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the Event id for File & folder creation in Window Server 2008 I have enabled Object level access in event viewer, but i am unable to find the exact date &amp; time, when the user create a file or folder.

Do you know, how to find out the time &amp; date in event viewer??

Below are the print-screen attached.

Assistant: This can be rather challenging task to analyze all of these events.

I would read more about a variety of event IDs related to Object access here.
Article also provides examples of events, which can definitely be useful.

Example 1

Example 2

I would probably search for some third-party auditing software with a more flexible settings or you will also need some sort of log-analyzer.
