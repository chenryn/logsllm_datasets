• IEF based on DDH-CP problem. Let G be a
non-abelian group. For any pair (g, h) ∈ G2 satisfying
gh (cid:54)= hg and (cid:104)g(cid:105) ∩ (cid:104)h(cid:105) = {1G}, let us deﬁne the index-
set as
K = {Ki = hxi : xi ∈ Zλ},

for each Ki ∈ K, the map ϕKi : G → G is deﬁned as
ϕKi (g) = hxi gh
−xi .
It can be proved that
ϕKi (ϕKj (g)) = h(xi+xj )gh
−(xi+xj ) = ϕKj (ϕKi (g)).
That is, we get an index exchangeable family ΩieK (g),
and apparently, under the intractability assumption of
DDH-CP problem over G, ΩieK (g) satisﬁes the property
of CMC.

abelian group. For any pair (g, h) ∈ G2 satisfying
gh (cid:54)= hg and (cid:104)g(cid:105) ∩ (cid:104)h(cid:105) = {1G}, deﬁne the index-set as
K = {Ki = (gxi , hyi ) : g, h ∈ G, xi ∈ Zλ, yi ∈ Zδ},
where λ, δ are orders of subgroups (cid:104)g(cid:105) and (cid:104)h(cid:105), respec-
tively. Then, for each index (gxi , hyi ) ∈ K, let us deﬁne
the map ϕKi : G → G as
ϕKi (g0) = gxi g0hyi
for a ﬁxed g0 ∈ G. It can be proved that
ϕKi (ϕKj (g0)) = gxi+xj g0hyi+yj = ϕKj (ϕKi (g0)).
That is, we get an index exchangeable family ΩieK (g0). Sim-
ilarly, we see that under the hard assumption of DDH-FP
problem over G, ΩieK (g0) satisﬁes the property of CMC.
Remark 2. In practice, it still works if we replace Zλ and
Zδ with integers set Z or natural numbers set N directly in
all above instantiations. By doing so, explicit speciﬁcation
on the index set K is no longer necessary.
4.2 Outsourcing technique based on non-abelian
analog
In this section, we propose an eﬃcient outsourcing tech-
nique for the encryption of the non-abelian analog based on
the factorization problem.
Key Generation: Suppose that λ is the system secure pa-
rameter, G is a non-abelian group with order of 2Θ(λ),
and the pair (g, h) ∈ G2 meets the conditions gh (cid:54)= hg.
Let H : G3 → {0, 1}λ × {0, 1}λ and H0 : G → {0, 1}λ
be secure cryptographic hash functions. Randomly
choose 8 large 3 integers xi, yi ∈ Z (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) and
compute
g1 = gx1 hy1 , b = gx2 hy2 , c = gx3 g1hy3 , d = gx4 g1hy4 .
Then, set the public key pk = (g, h, g1, b, c, d, H, H0)
and the secret key sk = (x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4).
Pre − processing: The encryptor randomly chooses t, ¯t ∈ Z
and computes his/her transformation key gt, h¯t.
Encryption: The encryption algorithm is divided into the
following steps:
3Here, the adjective “large” indicates that xi, yi should be
large enough for resisting exhaustive attacks.
In practice,
it is safe to sample them uniformly and randomly from the
interval [2λ, 2λ+1].
Stage 1. To encrypt a message m ∈ G, the user ran-
domly chooses two large integers x5, y5 ∈ Z, then com-
putes x5 − t, y5 − ¯t and sends (g, h, x5 − t, y5 − ¯t) as the
outsourcing parameters to cloud server.
Stage 2. The cloud server returns gx5−t, hy5−¯t to user.
Stage 3. The user computes gx5 = gx5−tgt, hy5 =
hy5−¯th¯t and then outputs the partial-ciphertext as
C0 = (u, v, e) = (gx5 hy5 , gx5 g1hy5 ,
H0(gx5 bhy5 gx5 chy5 ) ⊕ m),
and (α1, α2) = H(u, v, e). Then the user sends α1 −
t, α2 − ¯t to the cloud server.
Stage 4. The cloud server returns gα1−t, hα2−¯t to user.
Stage 5. The user computes gα1 , hα2 and then outputs
C = (u, v, e, w) for w = gx5 dhy5 · gα1 (gx5 bhy5 )hα2 .
Decryption: Upon receiving a ciphertext C = (u, v, e, w), if
the equation
w = gx4 vhy4 · gα1 gx2 uhy2 hα2
holds for (α1, α2) = H(u, v, e), then the receiver de-
crypts the message as
m = H0(gx2 uhy2 · gx3 vhy3 ) ⊕ e;
Otherwise, he/she outputs ⊥.
The security analysis is given as below.
Security of transformation key: Any adversary A wants
to compute the transformation key gt, h¯t, but it can
only obtain gth¯t = gt−x5 uh¯t−y5 . Based on the GFP,
A fails to derive gt, h¯t by the factoring method. Mean-
while, t, ¯t are secure relying on the DLP.
Security of encryption-random numbers: The advers-
ary can gets x5 − t, y5 − ¯t, where x5, y5 are blinded by
t, ¯t. Then the security of encryption-random numbers
x5, y5 is based on the privacy of t, ¯t.
4.3 Performance analysis
In the above outsourced scheme, the encryptor only has
to carry its transformation key then eliminates exponential
operation for encryption. Thus, the computational cost of
encryption can be largely reduced. Now we will present
the eﬃciency by comparing the outsourced encryption algo-
rithm with the non-outsourced scheme. Table 1 shows the
computational cost of multiplication (MUL) and exponential
(EXP) operations. Note that, the user requires two EXPs
in Pre-processing before encryption.

Fig. 1 is obtained based on a 2 × 2 matrix group over Zp.
We measured the running time of the two schemes with 80-
bit secure parameter (here we only consider the exhaustive
attack) by using Maple 18 on a 64-bit machine of 1.70GHz.
The ﬁgure clearly indicates that the outsourcing method
saves signiﬁcant computational cost for Cramer-Shoup like
encryption over non-abelian group.

5. CONCLUSION
Inspired by the seminal work of Diﬃe-Hellman’s key a-
greement protocol, we introduced the concept of index ex-
changeable family (IEF) and proposed another general frame-
work for constructing Cramer-Shoup like cryptosystems. We
further showed that IEF can be instantiated based on the
reasonable hardness assumptions originating from number
theory and computational group theory. In particular, our
instantiations can be considered as potential solutions to
Vasco et al.’s open problem of ﬁnding non-abelian analo-
gies of Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem.
In addition, we pro-
posed a secure outsourcing method for the encryption of the
non-abelian analog based on the factorization problem over
non-abelian groups. We demonstrated that the scheme can
signiﬁcantly reduce the computational cost thanks to using
the cloud servers.
