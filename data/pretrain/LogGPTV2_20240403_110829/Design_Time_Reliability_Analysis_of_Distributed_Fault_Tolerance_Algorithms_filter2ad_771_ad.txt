### Summary and Analysis of Fault Tolerance Strategies

#### Overview
The Convict Some strategy exhibited the lowest assumption failure rate, while the standard Convict All strategy had the highest, as illustrated in Figure 2 and Table 10. Certain configurations of the Convict Some strategy achieved a three orders of magnitude reduction in the assumption failure rate compared to the other two strategies (from \(10^{-10}\) to greater than \(10^{-11}\) in Table 10). Configurations with 4, 5, and 6 nodes showed high failure rates (greater than or equal to \(10^{-5}\)), whereas configurations with 7 or more nodes had lower failure rates. The Convict All and Convict Some strategies displayed a wider range of failure rates compared to the Convict None strategy, as depicted in Figure 2. This variability may be attributed to the conviction of good nodes (in the Convict All strategy) or the loss of redundancy due to convicted transient faulty nodes.

#### Detailed Analysis
- **Convict All Strategy**: In all cases studied, this strategy failed due to the depletion of redundancy, as shown in Table 11. This is likely due to events such as lightning strikes, which can cause the entire group to be convicted. The probability of two lightning strikes causing a complete conviction is \((4 \times 10^{-4})^2\) or \(1.6 \times 10^{-7}\). The Convict All strategy is particularly vulnerable to burst faults.
  
- **Convict None Strategy**: This strategy primarily failed due to an excessive number of active faults. The Convict Some strategy provided the best balance between the risks of too many active faults and insufficient redundancy.

- **Sensitivity to Fault Types**: The models were most sensitive to transient faults (Bit Error Rate (BER) and Single Event Upset (SEU)), with varying sensitivity to permanent link faults. All three strategies were insensitive to the Single Event Latchup (SEL) rate.

- **Impact of Adding Nodes**: Further investigation revealed that adding nodes might not improve reliability if the dominant cause of failure is too many active faults. For the Convict None strategy, configurations with 9 or more nodes failed due to an excess of active faults. The configurations with the lowest failure rates had 9 or 10 nodes. For the Convict Some strategy, configurations with 13 or more nodes failed due to too many active faults, with the lowest failure rates observed in configurations with 13 or 14 nodes.

- **Hypothesis on Node Addition**: We hypothesize that adding nodes will eventually decrease reliability for algorithms whose maximum fault assumption includes a fixed term. Increasing the number of nodes increases the likelihood of a pair of faults, thereby decreasing reliability. Many Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithms include a fixed term in their Maximum Fault Assumptions (MFAs) because a round-based algorithm must have at least \(f + 1\) rounds to tolerate \(f\) Byzantine faults [14], and the total number of rounds is usually fixed.

- **Convict Some Strategy Sensitivity**: We studied various probabilities for the conviction of permanent faulty nodes (0.99, 0.95, and 0.90) and incorrect transient fault conviction (0.01, 0.05, and 0.10). There was some sensitivity to the probability of convicting transient faulty nodes when the SEU rate was high. However, there was little sensitivity to the probability of misclassifying permanent faults, even at high fault rates. Given that the transient fault rates were higher than the permanent fault rates, it is logical that the models were most sensitive to the type of fault that occurs most frequently.

#### Sensitivity Analysis
This section explores the sensitivity of the system parameters assumed in Table 2 and Table 7. We selected two studies: the Welch and Lynch clock synchronization and the Convict All membership diagnosis strategy, fixing the number of nodes at 8. For both models, we examined two different chip sizes (64K and 256K) and four different percentages of bits affected by asymmetric SEUs (0%, 15%, 50%, and 100%). For the membership model, we also investigated three probabilities of convicting asymmetric faulty nodes (1.0, 0.95, and 0.90) and three probabilities of convicting good nodes in the event of an asymmetric fault (1/GN, 0.25, and 0.50).

- **Clock Synchronization Model**: The Welch and Lynch clock synchronization model was insensitive to changes in the total amount of memory and the amount of memory affected by asymmetric SEU faults. However, it was sensitive to the SEU rate, particularly for configurations with 7 or fewer nodes. For configurations with 8 or more nodes, other fault types (especially BER) dominated.

- **Convict All Diagnosis Strategy**: This strategy was sensitive to all system parameters studied. It was more sensitive to the total amount of memory than to the amount of memory susceptible to asymmetric SEU. Increasing the memory increased the rates of all SEU faults, leading to inadequate redundancy. Even with 90% asymmetric conviction, some configurations achieved a failure rate between \(10^{-6}\) and \(10^{-5}\), which was the lowest failure rate achieved by perfect conviction. This indicates that practical fault diagnosis algorithms perform well relative to ideal algorithms for the Convict All strategy.

#### Conclusions
Distributed fault tolerance algorithms must balance the risk of failure due to too many active faults versus the risk of failure due to inadequate redundancy caused by improper fault diagnosis. The designer's choice of a hybrid fault model and diagnosis strategy affects the probability of violating the maximum fault assumption. We present a methodology to assess the reliability of the maximum fault assumption at design time and to determine the dominant cause of failure. Our case studies on clock synchronization and group membership demonstrate the importance of choosing appropriate fault models and diagnosis strategies. For clock synchronization, a Strictly Omissive Asymmetric hybrid fault model has a significantly lower assumption failure rate than the Welch and Lynch hybrid fault model. For membership, a diagnosis strategy that discriminates between permanent and transient faults has a much lower assumption failure rate overall. Additionally, adding nodes can decrease reliability when the dominant cause of failure is too many active faulty nodes, which is crucial for designing rapid reintegration strategies.
