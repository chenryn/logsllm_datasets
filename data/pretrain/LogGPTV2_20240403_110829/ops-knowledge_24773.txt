User:  How to detect and resolve server port conflicts? Please write down the steps.
Assistant: Server port conflict issues are usually caused by multiple applications trying to listen on the same port. In order to detect and solve this problem, we can follow the steps below: 1. View the ports that have been opened You can use the "netstat -ano" command to view the ports that have been occupied. This command will display all open ports and the corresponding PID (process identifier). 2. View Processes in Task Manager Open Task Manager, find the Processes window, click on the "PID" column to sort, and find the process corresponding to the PID that will be displayed in the above steps. 3. Change the listening port of the application If the conflict is found to be caused by a certain application, we can try to change the listening port of the application to avoid the conflict. 4. Stop and restart the application or service After resolving the port conflict, stop and restart the application or service. 5. Monitor port activity You can use some network monitoring tools, such as Wireshark, to monitor port activity on the network, so as to discover and resolve port conflicts in time. If the port conflict problem still cannot be resolved, you may consider changing the IP address and port number of the server or virtual machine to resolve the conflict.
