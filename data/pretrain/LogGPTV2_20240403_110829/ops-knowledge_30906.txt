Assistant: This log chunk shows the system performing various tasks related to the AirPortBrcm4360, IO80211Family, and CoreCapture software components. It begins by clearing out any previous subscriptions and exiting the CCFile::captureLogRun. It then copies a file from the source path to the destination path. The kernel then changes the channel and denies network-outbound access. The WebKit component logs a ByteStream read and the symptomsd component logs an unexpected switch value. The kernel then handles a wake event and the CoreCapture component skips certain files and copies another file from the source path to the destination path. Finally, the kernel logs an ARPT and the CoreCapture component skips another file.
