Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

If you visit the following URL:  
[https://nextstore.itmohou.now.sh/](https://nextstore.itmohou.now.sh/)

- The site functions correctly.
- If you navigate to the "About" section in the footer and then press "Home," it will also work as expected.

However, if you:
- Navigate to any non-existent page (which currently results in an error page, as no other pages are available),
- And then press "Home,"

The navigation will get stuck, and the site will not return to the home page. All other pages function perfectly.

I have been unable to identify the issue. Here is the code repository for reference:
