Where D1 and D2 are two domain name sets and M DLV
is a function on domain name sets that computes the me-
dian daily successful lookup volume. We use the median,
2These are September 11th, 2012; March 25th, 2012 and
September 26th, 2011 for the 3322.org, Zeus and Kelihos
takedowns, respectively.
To provide a diﬀerent perspective, we also quantify the
potential risk of collateral damage, or the negative eﬀect of
mistakenly taking down benign domains. Ideally, we would
represent this by the number of distinct clients that would
be denied access to benign services, however, we can once
again turn to the lookup volumes to proxy for this.
If we assume all infected botnet hosts behave identically,
the aggregate lookup volume on a given day is proportional
to the number of infected clients. At most, a single lookup
corresponds to a distinct client reaching that domain, how-
ever, due to DNS caching eﬀects, diﬀerences in malware vari-
ant and human behaviors, and network address translation
(NAT), this is likely an overestimation of the actual client
population. We assume that these behaviors are consistent
with respect to queries towards a given botnet.
We quantify the potential risk of collateral damage for
a takedown as the diﬀerence in the median lookup volume
between an enumerated set and the initial seed domain set
as deﬁned by Equation 2.
Risk(D1, D2) = M DLV (D1) − M DLV (D2)
(2)
Using similar notation as seen in Equation 1. Intuitively,
the diﬀerence between these two quantities is proportional
to the number of individuals that would be inconvenienced
by this takedown if all the domains in D1 that are not in
D2 are not malicious. This provides an upper bound on the
potential risk involved. The “nuclear option” of taking down
all the domains in De, or sinkholing all domains that resolve
to hosts known to provide C&C for a botnet, is the only way
to ensure the C&C communication line is severed, however,
this should be weighed against the potential risks.
An analyst wishing to perform a takedown can use the risk
values to weigh whether to employ the “nuclear” option or
the more reserved options as described in Section 3.5. In fu-
ture work, we hope to improve the risk measure in two ways.
First, we can correlate the risk value with the identiﬁed true
and false positive rates during a real, or simulated, take-
down. Furthermore, we wish to more accurately estimate
the true population of visitors to infrastructure, malicious
or otherwise. This can further help analysts by allowing
them to weigh the likelihood of maliciousness against the
population that would be aﬀected by a takedown.
For each of the following takedown postmortem analy-
sis, the dashed red line on each plot indicates the date the
takedown was performed according to the court proceedings.
Each line plot represents the aggregate daily lookup volume
to a subset of domains that are either directed to a sinkhole
or contained within the enumerated infrastructure sets gen-
erated by rza. In all cases the De lookup volume represents
an upper bound of malicious lookups.

Table 1: T IR and Risk values for Kelihos takedown. These
values represent the improvement to a takedown based on
rza’s output and the potential risk of collateral damage, re-
spectively.
4.2 Kelihos
The Kelihos botnet was a spam botnet that sent approx-
imately four billion spam messages[15] a day in its ﬁrst it-
eration and was targeted for takedown in late 2011. We
show the daily volumes for the sets DS, De and Dm for Ke-
lihos in Figure 4. The day Kelihos was taken down, we see
lookups to the seed domains completely stop, showing that
these domains were eﬀectively remediated. The court order
did not specify sinkholes to be used, which explains why the
domains simply cease to resolve. The set of malware-related
domains, Dm, and interrogated domains, Di, also cut oﬀ
sharply at this point, with a handful of successful resolu-
tions occurring for Dm a few days after the takedown date
and ceasing to resolve afterwards. This suggests the initial
takedown missed some domains, but these were quickly re-
mediated as well. Dr has a spike similar to De, and upon
further investigation the spike was revealed to be a mali-
cious domain that resolved into Kelihos’ infrastructure but
could not be conﬁrmed to be a Kelihos C&C. This domain
stopped resolving after the peak date (September 24th).
The computed T IR values are shown in Table 1. Much
like the daily volumes ﬁgure, the T IR values suggest this
takedown was successful. We see large T IR values for De
and Dr, which indicate additional malicious domains were
left unperturbed that resolved into Kelihos’ hosting infras-
tructure. The similar trend between De and Dr suggests
that many of the extended infrastructure domains are in fact
malicious and could have been removed during the Kelihos
takedown eﬀort.
For the De and Dm sets, we have precision and recall
of 0.22/0.67 and 0.25/0.03, respectively. The recall for De
is quite low as this means upwards of 30% of the domain
names that are likely malicious were harvested from malware
interrogation. This stresses the importance of labeling both
from network information from pDNS, as well as information
gathered from malware.
According to the analysis by rza, this takedown was largely
a success, however, we know that new variants of Kelihos
emerged soon after. Analyzing its 168 malware samples from
before the takedown shows that a P2P C&C mechanism ex-
isted as a backup plan in the malware, which may have
helped bootstrap its resurgence. This stresses the impor-
tance of being prepared to counter malware behavior after
its primary infrastructure has been disabled.
4.3 Zeus
The Zeus takedown targeted a large botnet that used the
popular malware kit Zeus to create its malware. This take-
down relied on sinkholing the seed domains. We show the
daily volumes for the sets DS, De, Dm, Dr, as well the vol-
umes for domains in De that resolve into sinkholes operated
by Microsoft and the other sinkholing party, in Figure 5. Of
Figure 4: Kelihos aggregate daily lookup volume (log-scale).
the 2,825 malware samples analyzed, none of them included
a P2P- or DGA-based contingency plan.
The ﬁrst observation is that unlike in the case of Keli-
hos, Microsoft began sinkholing domains before the date
speciﬁed in the court order as evidenced by the non-zero
query volume resolving into Microsoft’s sinkholes before the
takedown date. To reiterate, domains that resolved only to
the sinkhole before the takedown date were not included to
prevent prior uses of the sinkhole from interfering with our
results. Furthermore, the volume of lookups that resolve
into the sinkhole are orders of magnitude larger than the
lookups only to the seed domains, suggesting that domains
not speciﬁed in the court order were also sinkholed. We see
a spike in lookup traﬃc directed towards the seed domains
and domains that resolve to Microsoft’s sinkhole, indicat-
ing increased sinkholing action at the time of takedown.
rza’s Dm set captured fewer domains than those sunk by
Microsoft’s sinkhole, however, there is a large discrepancy
in lookups to domains ﬂagged as malicious by our reputa-
tion system, i.e., lookups to the domains in set Dr. We see
a drop in lookups to Dr that corresponds to the Microsoft
sunk domains, which indicates Dr subsumes the set of sunk
domains. The other sinkhole operation experienced a similar
drop after the Microsoft takedown, which suggests there was
contention over which domains belonged to which sinkhole.
In this takedown, the ad-hoc nature of takedowns made
coordination between companies diﬃcult and the lack of
oversight allowed the court order to not be followed exactly.
While Microsoft was clearly sinkholing more domain names,
the takedown interfered with an existing takedown. With-
out a centralized method of communicating who is sinkhol-
ing what, this pattern of stepping on other researchers’ toes
is likely to continue.
The computed T IR values are shown in Table 2. We
compare against both the seed domain set, and the set of
domains resolving into Microsoft’s sinkhole. With respect
to the seed domain set, we nearly tie considering malware-
related domains and capture many more lookups to poten-

tially malicious domains when considering the dataset de-
rived from reputation, Dr. The story is similar when com-
pared to domains that resolve into the Microsoft sinkhole,
but to a lesser extent. Recall the volumes for Microsoft sink-
hole resolutions only include domains we identiﬁed in De.
This suggests that not only were these deemed malicious by
a 3rd party, but they were added by Microsoft independent
of the domains listed in the court order.
For the De and Dm sets, we have precision and recall of
0.03/0.98 and 0.30/0.01, respectively. Most of these values
are quite low, with the exception of De’s recall, which is
unsurprising. This indicates most of the malicious domains
could be identiﬁed through passive DNS. The low precision
value for De indicates that many of these domains should
probably not be targeted in a takedown and the low preci-
sion for Dm suggests that while many have low reputation
and are likely malicious there are no known malware asso-
ciations, reinforcing the motivation for using domain name
reputation.

4.4 3322.org
The 3322.org takedown represents the most extreme case
where rza would have improved a takedown’s eﬀectiveness.

mains deemed malicious resolved to a set of known sinkhole
IP addresses. The daily volume plot for 3322.org is shown
in Figure 6. Unlike the Zeus takedown, domains were sunk
on the day of the takedown and were limited to *.3322.org
domain names. Unfortunately, this only accounted for a
fraction of the lookups to domains with known malware as-
sociations, Dm, and domains with low reputation, Dr that
resolved to hosts known to support malicious activity. We
notice a drop in lookups to Dm and Dr when the takedown
is performed, showing that most of the domains targeted by
the takedown were likely malicious, however, the lookups to
remaining infrastructure identiﬁed by rza are still frequent.
We see Di closely matches the sinkholed domain names, sug-
gesting this is the primary method that was used to identify
the takedown domains. Unlike the previous two cases, all
enumerated sets have T IR values greater than one. This
agreement suggests that malicious domains were almost cer-
tainly missed during the 3322.org takedown eﬀort. Of the
10,135 malware samples we analyzed, none of them had a
P2P- or DGA-based contingency plan.
This case shows the importance of using multiple sources
to determine related malicious infrastructure before perform-
ing a takedown. Simply identifying domains with known
malware associations oﬀers a substantial improvement on
the eﬀectiveness of the takedown. Further, the similarity
between the Dm and Dr trends shows most of the domains
overlap between the two, which only further bolsters the
likelihood that they are indeed malicious. To make matters
worse, all the domains that were not sinkholed were given
enterprise-level domain name resolution services, despite the
high probability they were involved in malicious activities.
The computed T IR values for the 3322.org takedown are
shown in Table 3. Unlike the previous two postmortems,
rza identiﬁed numerous additional malicious domains that
were left undisturbed by the takedown on 3322.org.
For the De and Dm sets, we have precision and recall
of 0.06/0.95 and 0.38/0.03, respectively. These results are
similar to those for Zeus and further reinforce the need to
include domain reputation as a measure in rza. Simply rely-
ing on passive DNS (for De) and malware associations (for
Dm) overestimate and underestimate the malicious domain
names, respectively.
5. TAKEDOWN RECOMMENDATION ANAL-
YSIS
In this section, we run rza’s takedown protocol on 45 bot-
net C&Cs being tracked by Damballa, Inc. during the
month of April, 2013 and present the results. We chose
to use the C&Cs already tracked by Damballa out of conve-
nience and it is important to stress that they could be sub-
stituted by any set of domain names known to correspond
to a botnet’s C&C infrastructure. There are many publicly
available sources of this information that allow similar ex-
periments to be repeated. The calculated TIR values and
