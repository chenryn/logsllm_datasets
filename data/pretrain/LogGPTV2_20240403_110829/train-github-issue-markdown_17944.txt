# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18999.1
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): Version: 0.5.2762.0
# Steps to reproduce
Start Windows Terminal in Ubuntu 18.04. Install Vim. Start Vim. Type a
sentence then move the cursor over a letter. See that the letter is obscured.
# Expected behavior
I'd expect the text underneath the cursor to be inverse of the cursor, or
something that isn't the same as the cursor color making it invisible. I've
tried almost every Vim setting for changing cursor color etc but it has no
effect. Changing the `cursorColor` in the profile has no effect.
Running the same test in Fluent Terminal (while having a blinking cursor by
default) does the right thing.
# Actual behavior
The cursor obscures the text underneath it:
