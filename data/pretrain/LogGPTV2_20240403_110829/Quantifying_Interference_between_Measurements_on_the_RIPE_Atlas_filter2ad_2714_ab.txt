DNS output is less impacted by extra delay.
We also study the decrease in synchrony by measuring
the completion time of one-oﬀ traceroutes performed on the
probe.
. . . when increasing the number of concurrent mea-
surements sourced from a probe To generate load on a
probe, we launch an increasing number of one-oﬀ traceroutes
from it using the REST API [26]. We use traceroute because
it uses the most resources, as indicated by the higher cost.
It is also one of the tools mostly used by researchers.
. . . when increasing the number of concurrent mea-
surements targeting a probe The second technique we
use to load a probe consists in gradually increasing the num-
ber of ICMP echo requests (800 bytes) targeted to it. We use
a set of NL Ring nodes as sources. Each source sends 16 echo
requests per second. We start with a single source. Every 2
minutes, we add a new source. We stop when there are 115
sources (115 ∗ 16 = 1840 ping/s). While such frequencies are
not common, experiments that use Atlas probes in a mesh-
like fashion [16, 19, 20, 21] or that ping them from machines
not limited in ping frequency may generate such a load. We
use several Ring nodes as sources to mimic real experiments.
To perform remote pings on multiple Ring nodes and collect
the results, we built a tool [9] atop Scamper [27].
. . . and while preventing the eﬀects from external
factors We want to focus on the behavior of the probe and
avoid network interferences. For each experiment, we mea-
sure the delay between the tested Atlas probe and a colo-
cated Ring node in the same LAN (i.e. there is no IP hop

increase when concurrent one-oﬀ traceroutes are launched
on this probe.
between them). Because packets between the Atlas probe
and its colocated Ring node always stay in the same LAN,
we prevent our measurements from being polluted by Inter-
net variations (Figure 2). We obtained these pairs of colo-
cated Atlas probe and Ring node by a traceroute campaign
between each Ring node and Atlas probes in the same AS.
The results depicted in Table 2 all come from measurements
done between an Atlas probe and its colocated NL Ring
node.
4. DECREASED PRECISION
We now use our methodology (§3) to measure: i) the de-
crease in precision of delay-based measurements (this sec-
tion); and (ii) the decrease in synchrony produced by con-
current measurements (§5). We performed all our measure-
ments on multiple probes (at least two per version) to ensure
conformity. As their number is not negligible and their de-
crease in precision and synchrony is serious, the next ﬁgures
only focus on v2 probes.
Delays measured from the probe increase when con-
current measurements are launched on it. We launched
ping measurements from the Atlas probe and towards eight
random Ring nodes plus the colocated Ring node. The ping
rate towards each destination is 9 ping/min, averaging 1.4
ping/s over all destinations. We increase the load on the
probe by launching successively 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and
500 one-oﬀ traceroutes.
Figure 3 shows the impact of the concurrent one-oﬀ tracer-
outes on the delay measured from a v2 probe. The blue
points are RTTs between the Atlas probe and its colocated
Ring node, while the red points are RTTs between the Atlas
probe and another Ring node. The gray areas are the peri-
ods when one-oﬀ traceroutes are running. The number above
each gray area is the number of one-oﬀ traceroutes executed.
To quantify the impact, we compare the median, 95th per-
centile, and standard deviation of the ping measurements
before the one-oﬀ traceroutes (the white area preceding the
gray area) and during the one-oﬀ traceroutes execution time
(gray area). The diﬀerence is reported in Table 2.
Delays measured from the probe systematically increase
when one-oﬀ traceroutes are performed. Starting 100 one-
oﬀ traceroutes increases the median delay of the concurrent
pings by more than 1 ms. For v1 and v2 Atlas probes, the
standard deviation is seriously impacted: +16.3 ms (v1) and
+7.4 ms (v2). Atlas probes v3 show less eﬀect, the median is
only increased by 0.06 ms while the standard deviation is not
impacted; this is due to v3 probes having more power. Sur-

Table 2: Quantiﬁcation of interferences for v1, v2 and v3 probes. At the top, the probe is loaded by sourcing 100 one-oﬀ
traceroutes. At the bottom, the load comes from incoming pings. Columns represent benchmarking measurements. On the
left, we look at the impact of a load on the ping delay reported by the probe. On the right, pings are destined to the probe.
With more powerful hardware, v3 probes are less sensitive to load than v1 and v2. ∗We used these pings to quantify the
impact a load towards the probe produces on ping delay sourced on the probe (bottom-left).
Figure 4: Delays measured towards a v2 probe systematically
increase when concurrent one-oﬀ traceroutes are launched on
the probe.
Figure 5: Delays measured from a v2 probe increase as the
ping frequency targeting the probe increases.
prisingly, the number of one-oﬀ traceroutes does not change
the magnitude of the impact but increases its duration: 10
one-oﬀ traceroutes impact as severely as 100 the concurrent
ping measurements. As soon as the one-oﬀ traceroutes are
done, RTTs go back to normal almost immediately.
Delays measured towards the probe increase when
concurrent measurements are launched on it. We
chose eight random Ring nodes plus the colocated Ring node
and ping from them towards the Atlas probe with a fre-
quency of 1 ping/s, summing up to a load of 9 ping/s. We
then perform successively 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 one-
oﬀ traceroutes from the Atlas probe.
Figure 4 shows the impact of the one-oﬀ traceroutes on
the delay measured towards the Atlas probe. The blue points
are the delays reported between the colocated Ring node and
the Atlas probe while the red points are the delays reported
between another Ring node and the Atlas probe. Again, gray
indicates periods when one-oﬀ traceroutes are running.
The impact on pings targeting the probe is relatively lower
(Table 2). When 100 one-oﬀ traceroutes are executed, the
median of RTTs targeting a v2 Atlas probe increases by
0.5 ms. Despite the lower impact, we can easily see RTT
shifts.
Delays measured from and towards a probe increase
when it is used as a destination by concurrent mea-
surements. We ﬁrst launch pings from the Atlas probe to-
wards its colocated Ring node with a frequency of 9 ping/min.
We then use an increasing set of Ring nodes to target the
probe with 800 bytes pings, each of them sending 16 ping/s
(§3).
Figure 5 shows the impact on delay measured from the
probe. Unlike with one-oﬀ traceroute measurements, the im-
pact now increases with the number of pings directed to-
wards the probe. When the frequency reaches 400 ping/s,
the median delay reported by the probe increases by 0.22 ms,
while the 95th percentile increases by 2.90 ms and the stan-
dard deviation by 3.90 ms. The probe becomes completely
overloaded when the frequency reaches 1000 ping/s. This
leads to very high delays (∼1000 ms). Also, 10% of the pings
are lost when the frequency becomes higher than 1280 ping/s.
Here, the probe is the target of the load. Traﬃc is just sent to
the probe, without involving the RIPE Atlas controller. We
believe the inaccuracy increases progressively because the
load per unit of time also increases. The controller cannot
smooth the load by spreading it in time.
Figure 6 illustrates similar eﬀects on the delays measured
towards the probe. At the bottom of the ﬁgure, each box
shows the inter-quartile range of RTTs between the colo-
cated Ring node and the Atlas probe. The line in the box
depicts the median value; the whiskers show the 1st and
the 99th percentile, respectively. The top ﬁgure indicates
the packet loss percentage. When reaching 1000 ping/s, the
median RTT increases by 0.45 ms and the 95th percentile
increases by 2.60 ms. As in Figure 5, when the frequency

losses may appear if the ping frequency towards the probe
becomes too high.
becomes even higher, the probe becomes completely over-
loaded. Reported delays skyrocket (∼1000 ms) and some re-
quests are lost.
Interference eﬀects are compounded when combin-
ing source and destination load. So far, we have quan-
tiﬁed separately the impact of using a probe as source or as
destination. In reality, a probe may be used both as source
and as destination at the same time. We could expect these
interference eﬀects to be additive, but our experiments show
that these eﬀects are compounded.
To quantify, we ﬁrst start pings between an Atlas probe
and its colocated Ring node (9 ping/min). We then start
to ﬂood the probe using the set of Ring nodes as described
before. Finally, we start series of 25 one-oﬀ traceroutes. Fig-
ure 7 shows the results. The blue points are the measured de-
lays between the probe and the colocated Ring node. The red
vertical line indicates when we start to ﬂood the probe with
pings. The gray areas are the periods when one-oﬀ tracer-
outes are running. Before starting to ﬂood the probe, we
performed 25 one-oﬀ traceroutes in order to be able to com-
pare the interference eﬀects produced by these traceroutes
with and without the ping ﬂood. Each green point on the
top indicates a traceroute success. The success rate of each
one-oﬀ traceroute series is also mentioned.
When compounding source and destination load, delays
measured from the probe increase even further. During the
second series of one-oﬀ traceroutes, the standard deviation of
the delay reported by the probe to the colocated Ring node
is 30.8 ms and the 95th percentile is 23.9 ms. These values
are far higher than the addition of the interference eﬀects
produced by a non-combined load on source and destination
(Table 2). Success rate is also eﬀected. 99% of the pings are
lost during the last one-oﬀ traceroute series.
Key points. We observed signiﬁcant interferences on delay
measurements for v1 and v2 probes. These probes compose
28% percent of the platform. An important portion (34%)
of the public experiments available result from experiments
on v1 and v2 probes.

tion time. Atlas measurements are indeed scheduled over
