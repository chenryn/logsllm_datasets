User: I am new to gnuplot. I am using Unix.
I see the commands/error and their output on the terminal but I want to save them on a file too for storage purposes.
There is a save command in gnuplot but it only saves the last plot or splot command given by  the module and the final settings.
Suppose I plot a line with settings 'A' and after doing some calculation I went and re-plotted another line with setting 'B'
gnuplot.save() command would only save the last command and the latest settings. How can I save all the issued commands?
Kindly help...
Assistant: Non-python answer would be to use `script' command.
