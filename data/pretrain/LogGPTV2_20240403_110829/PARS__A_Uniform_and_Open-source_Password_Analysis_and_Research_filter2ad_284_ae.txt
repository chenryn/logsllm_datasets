with the results in Table 5. From this point of view, the

In summary, most of the evaluation results of the intra-
site and cross-site metrics are generally consistent with the
cracking results in Table 5. Therefore, these metrics are
helpful to estimate the security of a password dataset, given
the availability of the password distribution information.
5.3 Academic Strength Meters and Analysis
α values.
Academic Meters. In PARS, we implement and eval-
uate 8 popular strength meter proposals from academia:
NIST meter [11], CMU meter [21], PCFG meter [8] [5], Ideal
meter [7], Adaptive meter [7], Brute Force Markov (BFM)
meter [9], Weir meter [9], and Probability-Threshold Graph
(PTG) [10]. Below, we summarize and analyze the 8 meters
in Table 8.
(1) NIST and CMU are rule-based meters. Speciﬁcally,
NIST assigns an entropy score to a password based on cer-
tain rules, e.g., the entropy of the ﬁrst character is 4 bits,
the entropy of the next 7 characters are 2 bits per charac-
ter. CMU assigns an entropy score to a password based on
statistical rules trained from some password dataset. The
methodologies of other academia meters are either statistics-
based or attack-based. For the statistics-based Ideal meter,
it assigns an entropy score to a password of a dataset based
on the statistics on that dataset, e.g., probability distribu-
tion. For attack-based meters, they measure the strength
of passwords by estimating the diﬃculty of using a cracking
model to attack these passwords.
(2) The attack-based meters leverage either PCFG-based
cracking algorithms [14, 17] or Markov-based cracking al-
gorithms [13, 16]. For PTG, although it is Markov-based in
[10], actually, it can also be implemented by leveraging other
cracking algorithms, e.g., PCFG-based algorithms [17]. To
build these meters, a pre-training phase is necessary. There-
fore, the performance of all the attack-based meters is crack-
ing algorithm dependent and training data dependent.
(3) The strength outcomes of diﬀerent meters varies. NIST,
CMU, Ideal, and Adaptive employ entropy; PCFG computes
the cracking probability of a password using the PCFG-
based cracking algorithm in [17]; BFM and Weir plot the
number of cracked passwords given a number of guesses; and
PTG plots the probability threshold versus the percentage
of passwords above the threshold.
Academic Meters Evaluation. Here, we evaluate the
performance of academic meters. Due to the space limita-
tion, we put the evaluation results of NIST, CMU, and Ideal
in [2]. Basically, according to our evaluation, the results
of the NIST meter have little correlation with the actual
password security, especially in the training-based cracking
scenarios, which is consistent with observations in many ex-
isting works, e.g., [8]. CMU is another rule-based meter
similar to NIST. The actual performance of the CMU me-
ter depends on the training dataset. The Ideal meter is
only a theoretical meter [7]. Its results come directly from
the actual password distribution of a dataset. For PCFG-
based meters PCFG [5, 8] and Weir [9], although they have
diﬀerent types of outcomes (e.g., probability, guess num-
ber), their performance is equivalent with respect to mea-
suring password strength distribution. The reason is that
they rely on the same cracking algorithm PCFG [17]. Simi-
larly, for Markov-based meters [7] [9] [10], their performance
is also equivalent on measuring password strength distribu-
tion since they are all based on the same cracking model.

Figure 1: Academic meters evaluation.
Therefore, we use PCFG and Markov to represent PCFG-
based and Markov-based meters, respectively. To make the
evaluation results comparable, we convert all the meters’
outputs to the entropy distribution. Furthermore, we em-
ploy Tianya and Rockyou as example training datasets and
CSDN, LinkedIn, and Gamigo as example testing datasets for
evaluating meters (complete evaluation scenarios of the 8
datasets are available at [2]). The results are shown in Fig.1,
where (a) and (b) show the entropy distribution of all the
passwords in CSDN, LinkedIn, and Gamigo, and (c) and (d)
show the entropy distribution of the cracked passwords of
CSDN, LinkedIn, and Gamigo by Tianya and Rockyou trained
PCFG and OMEN. From Fig.1, we have the following ob-
servations.
(1) From Fig.1 (a) and (b), we see that most passwords
have their entropy in range [10, 35] under the PCFG meter
and [20, 60] under the Markov meter. Both meters assign
more entropy to Gamigo than CSDN and LinkedIn. This im-
plies Gamigo is more secure than CSDN and LinkedIn. Fur-
ther, LinkedIn has higher entropy than CSDN, and thus CSDN
is more crackable than LinkedIn. Generally, the above ob-
servations are consistent with our results in Table 5.
(2) From Fig.1 (a) and (b), we can also see that for CSDN,
both Tianya-trained meters assign lower entropy than both
Rockyou-trained meters. This implies CSDN is more vulner-
able given Tianya than given Rockyou. On the other hand,
according to the results of the two meters, LinkedIn is more
vulnerable given Rockyou than given Tianya. These two ob-
servations are also consistent with our results in Table 5. For
Gamigo under the PCFG meter, its low entropy (weak) pass-
words are more vulnerable given Rockyou while its high en-
tropy (strong) passwords are more vulnerable given Tianya
according to the results. For Gamigo under the Markov me-
ter, it is more vulnerable given Rockyou, which is generally
consistent with the results in Table 5.
(3) From Fig.1 (c) and (d), we see that most of the cracked
passwords have entropy in the range of [5, 30] under the
PCFG meter and [15, 35] under the Markov meter. Com-
paring the results with those in Fig.1 (a) and (b), we con-
clude that most of the crackable passwords have low en-
tropy.Therefore, both the PCFG meters [5, 8, 9] and Markov
meters [7, 9] [10] are meaningful in practice. Furthermore,
the cracked passwords of LinkedIn and Gamigo have lower
entropy than that of CSDN. Again, this implies LinkedIn and
Gamigo are more secure than CSDN.
5.4 Commercial Meters and Analysis
Commercial Meters. Besides academic metrics and
meters, we also implement 15 commercial password strength
meters. First, we examine the top-15 sites in 10 categories
ranked by Alexa. We summarize the basic statistics of the

150 websites in Table 9 (detailed information and statistics
are available at [2]), where Lower Limit (LL) and Upper
Limit (UL) denote the minimum and maximum length re-
quirements on acceptable passwords respectively, C1 (let-
ters only), C2 (letters or/and digits only), C3 (letters, dig-
its or/and symbols), C4 (letters or/and digits only, at least
one digit), C5 (letters, digits, or/and symbols, at least one
digit/symbol ), and C6 (Trivariate) are six password com-
position policies, and N/A implies that either a site does
not support the user registration function or the registration
phase is not accessible unless the user is a customer/member
of that site (e.g., Bank of America). Furthermore, the val-
ues in Table 9 indicate the number of sites meeting the
length/composition policy requirement, having password me-
ters, having no policy requirement, or N/A. From Table 9,
we have the following observations.
(1) 103 sites (password checkers/meters) have minimum
password length constraints. Further, the sites that have
many high-value accounts, e.g., Computers/Shopping/Business
sites, tend to require users to choose longer passwords. On
the other hand, 37 sites have explicit maximum password
length constraints. Actually, many sites do have constraints
on maximum password length although they do not explic-
itly state that.
(2) Among the 150 sites, 33 have explicit password com-
position policies (C1-C6). 7 sites have no policy at all, i.e.,
even one character can be used as a password. 24 sites have
password meters that can assign a score/label for an input
password. One third of the Shopping/Computers sites em-
ploy password meters to indicate to users the strength of
their passwords.
Based on the techniques in [24], we implement both on-
line and oﬄine versions of 15 out of the 24 meters in Table 9
in PARS3. For the online versions, we implement an online
