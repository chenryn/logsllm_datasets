### Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis (MRA)

Wavelet multiresolution analysis (MRA) is used to compare byte and packet-arrival rates at varying time scales. The wavelet scaling plots, or energy plots, show the variance (burstiness) in the traffic arrival process at different timescales, enabling visual inspection of the complex structure in traffic processes.

- **Example Interpretation**: In Figure 8, the x-axis represents increasing time scales (on a log scale) starting from 1 ms, and the y-axis shows the energy of the traffic at a given time scale. A sharp dip in the curve, such as one occurring at a time scale of 9 (256 ms), suggests a strong periodicity (and hence lower variance and energy) around that time scale. This dip often corresponds to the dominant Round-Trip Time (RTT) of flows, which is well understood [12, 21, 41] and results from the self-clocking nature of TCP. Similarly, if all flows are bottlenecked upstream at a link with a capacity of 10 Mbps, a dip would be expected at 1.2 ms (the time to transmit a 1500-byte packet across a 10 Mbps link).

- **Matching Energy Plots**: If the energy plot for a generated trace closely matches the energy plot for the original trace, it indicates that the burstiness of the packet or byte arrival process matches at various timescales. This matching is crucial for scenarios sensitive to burstiness, such as high-speed router design, active queue management, and flow classification. Matching the energy plot at both fine- (sub-RTT) and coarse-timescales has proven challenging, but our work demonstrates such a match across a range of timescales.

### Application Studies

Given our general validation approach, we present the results of case studies for:
1. Capturing the fine-grained behavior of individual application classes in our packet traces.
2. Validating macro properties of our generated traces.
3. Matching the burstiness of traffic across a range of time granularities.

#### 5.1 Distribution Parameters

We first measure Swing's ability to accurately capture the distributions for the structural properties of users and applications. We present results for three representative applications: KAZAA from CAIDA, SQUID from Auck, and HTTP from Mawi. Our model is generic to each of these application classes and requires no manual configuration for the various traces/applications. Results for other application classes/trace combinations are similar.

- **Table 3** compares the distribution of our parameters relative to the original trace (Trace/Swing), with the median values and IQR. Matching IQR values and the median indicates similar distributions for both the extracted and generated values.

- **Accuracy and Sensitivity**: While the required level of accuracy is application-dependent, based on these results, we are satisfied with our ability to reproduce application and user characteristics. Model parameters that attempt to reproduce human/machine think time are the most challenging to extract and reproduce. For example, the IQR of interconn times for Auck/SQUID differs by 500 ms. However, sensitivity experiments (ยง 5.3) reveal that considering these characteristics is important to reproduce trace properties, and our approximations appear sufficient based on the quality of the generated traces. On the other hand, we achieve near-perfect accuracy for more mechanistic model parameters such as request and response size (see Table 3).

### Wide-Area Network Conditions

Figure 5 shows the extracted values of the two-way latencies of hosts on either side of the target link in the Auck trace. More than 75% of the hosts see delays within a certain range. Figures 6 and 7 compare the CDFs of link capacities and loss rates, respectively, for the Auck and Swing traces.

- **Figure 5**: Two-way delay for hosts.
- **Figure 6**: Upstream and downstream capacities.
- **Figure 7**: Loss rates for feeding links.

These figures help validate the wide-area network conditions and ensure that the generated traces accurately reflect the real-world network behavior.
