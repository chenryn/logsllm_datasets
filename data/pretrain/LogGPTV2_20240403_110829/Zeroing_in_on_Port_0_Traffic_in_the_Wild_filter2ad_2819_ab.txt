rDNS names, websites, and abuse contacts. During our active measurements, we
received one email asking to be blocked, to which we immediately complied.
When analyzing passive ﬂow and packet data, we fully comply with the
respective NDAs and do not share any personally identiﬁable information. Con-
trary to the active measurements, we will not publish any passive measurement
data.
3.2 Reproducible Research
To foster reproducibility in measurement research [1,38], we make data, source
code, and analysis tools of our active measurements publicly available [18]. Due
to privacy reasons we will not publish data from the passive datasets.
3.3 Continuous Port 0 Measurements
To allow further analysis of port 0 responsiveness and ﬁltering over time, we peri-
odically run active port 0 measurements. The raw results of these measurements
are publicly available for fellow researchers at:

4 Flow-Level Analysis
Zeroing in on Port 0 Traﬃc in the Wild
551
Analyzing the traﬃc ﬂowing between diﬀerent Autonomous Systems is helpful
to detect high-level patterns. To investigate port 0 traﬃc patterns, we use the
IXP dataset and inspect the ASes originating or being targeted by port 0 traﬃc.
In one week of IXP ﬂow data, we ﬁnd 23,000 ASes contributing to port 0 traﬃc.
We observe that the source AS with highest number of packets in sends port 0
traﬃc to 4357 distinct destination ASes. Also, the destination AS with highest
number of port 0 packets being destined to, is targeted by 1245 distinct source
ASes.
We also observe that in 9 out of 10 top source ASes involved in port 0 traﬃc,
port number 0 is among the top-5 source and destination port numbers along
with TCP/80 (HTTP) and TCP/443 (HTTPS). We ﬁnd that more than 99%
of port 0 traﬃc has both source and destination port set to zero. Interestingly,
more than 99% of all TCP traﬃc contains no TCP ﬂags. This leads us to believe
that this is not actual port 0 traﬃc and is most likely an artifact of packet
fragmentation [26], which is incorrectly classiﬁed as TCP/0 traﬃc by the ﬂow
exporter [35]. We also analyze the 1% of the TCP traﬃc with non-zero TCP ﬂags,
composed of 867 packets. We ﬁnd that 30% of this traﬃc sets their TCP ﬂags to
CWR/URG/ACK, 27% to ACK only, and 25% to URG/ACK/PSH/SYN. 62%
of this traﬃc has an average packet size of less than 100 bytes, while 18% has
an average packet size of more than 1480 bytes. To investigate more in-depth on
how diﬀerent networks react to port 0 traﬃc, we perform active measurements
(cf. Sect. 6).
To further investigate origins and causes of port 0 traﬃc, we analyze the
diurnal patterns of traﬃc originated by the top 10 source ASes and compare
them with the more common Web traﬃc on TCP/80. Figure 1 shows a heatmap
of the Spearman correlation of the diurnal patterns of these ASes and TCP/80
traﬃc. We see that while AS2 is the most correlated to TCP/80 traﬃc, AS4
and AS7 show highly similar patterns to each other and moderate correlation to
TCP/80 traﬃc. Moreover, AS3 shows a unique pattern with no correlation to
either other ASes or TCP/80.
AS3 is a cloud computing provider while other ASes are web hosting
providers, ISPs, or telecommunication companies. The unique traﬃc pattern
originated by AS3 implies irregular usage such as scanning or reset attack. For
the interested reader we provide a time series plot for the aforementioned ASes
in Appendix B.
To better understand the causes of port 0 traﬃc, we analyze average payload
sizes observed in the IXP dataset. For easier comparison with the packet-level
datasets (cf. Sect. 5), we choose to analyze the payload size instead of the average
packet size reported directly in the ﬂow data. We estimate the payload size by
subtracting the IP and TCP/UDP headers without options. As shown in Fig. 2,
for TCP, we observe that nearly 88% of packets are smaller than 100 bytes, while
in UDP, more than 75% of packets are larger than 100 bytes. Having roughly 20%
full-sized packets in UDP, along with many mid-sized packets, indicates possible
fragmentation. Unfortunately, our IPFIX dataset does not include fragmentation

information for IPv4 ﬂows. It does, however, include information about the IPv6
next header value. We ﬁnd no IPv6 ﬂows with the next header value set to
fragmentation (i.e., 44). To investigate further on the exact fragmentation header
ﬂag, we inspect the IPFIX ﬁeld containing a list of all IPv6 extension headers in
a ﬂow. We ﬁnd, however, that the content of this IPFIX ﬁeld does not conform
to the IPFIX speciﬁcations as deﬁned by the RFC. This is possibly due to
an erroneous early version of the RFC, which has since been corrected [2]. As
IPFIX datasets usually depend heavily on how their exporter is implemented,
researchers who would like to work on them should be extra cautious to make
sure that their data is ﬂawless.
To summarize, multiple indicators lead us to believe that most of port 0 traﬃc
seen at the IXP is an artifact of packet fragmentation. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that
the IXP data gives valuable information on diurnal patterns. By analyzing the
correlation between diurnal patterns of diﬀerent ASes and port 80 traﬃc, we
ﬁnd one AS deviating heavily from the common diurnal patterns. This indicates
possible scanning or other irregular activities which requires a more in-depth
analysis which can only be performed on packet-level data. Therefore, we analyze
the four packet-level datasets in the upcoming section.
5 Packet-Level Analysis
Although using a ﬂow-level dataset provides us with useful information about the
origin and targets of port 0 traﬃc, it cannot provide information on what the
packets actually contain. Knowing the packet content, we can infer the cause
of port 0 usage more precisely. To this end, we use the MAWI-long, MAWI-
short, CAIDA, and Waikato datasets. CAIDA contains no payload, while others
provide partial payload data. We begin our packet-level analysis by investigating
packet payload sizes, for which we use the packet length ﬁeld found in UDP and
TCP headers. As Fig. 2 shows, nearly all packets in MAWI-short, MAWI-long
Zeroing in on Port 0 Traﬃc in the Wild
553
and Waikato have a payload size of less than 100 bytes. In both the MAWI-
short and the CAIDA dataset, more than 99% of the TCP port 0 traﬃc does
not have any payload, while UDP traﬃc always contains payload. Note that
Fig. 2 only shows those TCP packets with payload, i.e., for CAIDA and MAWI-
short, it shows less than 1% of all TCP packets. In the CAIDA dataset, while
UDP traﬃc includes payload sizes smaller than 104 bytes in 99% of the packets,
TCP traﬃc shows more mid-sized payload sizes. Investigating further into the
CAIDA dataset shows that all packets contain zero as fragment oﬀset and all the
fragmentation ﬂags are set to Don’t Fragment. This suggests that port 0 traﬃc
in the CAIDA dataset is likely not a fragmentation artifact. However, we ﬁnd
some bogus packets, e.g. with zero header length among these mid-sized TCP
packets.
Similar to our analysis in Sect. 4, we investigate port 0 traﬃc origins and
destinations in the MAWI dataset. We ﬁnd that most of the traﬃc, namely more
than 60%, is destined to only 2 ASes, as shown in Fig. 3. Figure 4 shows the
cumulative distribution of IP addresses in port 0 traﬃc in diﬀerent datasets. We
exclude the MAWI-long dataset since aggregating through 14 years would not
give us useful information. We observe that more than 75% of port 0 traﬃc is
originated by less than 10 IP addresses in CAIDA, IXP, and MAWI-short. Also
in all the datasets, more than 87% of port 0 traﬃc is destined to less than 10 IP
addresses.
In Fig. 5, we show the payload distribution classiﬁed with libprotoident [3]
for each year in the MAWI-long dataset. The red line along with the right Y-
axis show total number of packets throughout diﬀerent years. The stacked bar
plots show diﬀerent categories of payloads excluding No Payload and Unknown
UDP. We ﬁnd that BitTorrent traﬃc is a constant contributor to port 0 traﬃc
