## Abstract
The frequency and complexity of cyber attacks have increased significantly in recent years, prompting companies and organizations to invest more in robust infrastructure to protect their data, assets, and reputation. However, complete protection against these evolving threats is unattainable through preventive measures alone. To manage residual risks and mitigate business losses, firms are increasingly adopting cyber insurance as part of their corporate risk management strategies.

The cyber insurance sector, which transfers financial risks related to network and computer incidents to a third party, is rapidly growing, with claims already reaching $100 million. Unlike other insurance sectors that rely on established methodologies for risk prediction, the unique characteristics of the cyber domain often lead to qualitative approaches based on expert opinions.

This paper reviews past research in the field of cyber insurance, categorizing studies into four areas: economic aspects, mathematical models, risk management methodologies, and predictions of cyber events. We then identify, for each phase of the insurance process, practical research problems where security experts can develop new data-driven methodologies and automated tools to replace existing qualitative approaches.

## 1. Introduction

Modern society heavily relies on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). However, this reliance also introduces significant risks. Computer systems and services are frequently compromised, leading to adverse impacts on many organizations, including substantial financial losses. As a result, cybersecurity has become a critical topic in executive boards, and companies are increasingly investing in ICT security products. The security sector is expected to grow to a $124 billion market by 2019, with key investments in application security testing, data loss prevention, and advanced threat protection.

Despite these efforts, it is well understood that technical solutions alone cannot prevent all cyber attacks, and comprehensive protection is neither possible nor economically feasible. Therefore, organizations are incorporating cyber insurance into their multi-layered security frameworks to handle residual risks. Cyber insurance transfers financial risks related to network and computer incidents to a third party, covering digital data loss, damage, and theft, as well as losses due to network outages, computer failures, and website defacements.

### 1.1 A Booming Phenomenon Missing Solid Foundations

Recent market reports indicate a significant increase in the adoption of cyber insurance, with an annual growth rate of over 30% since 2011. This trend is reflected in the growing number of claims submitted for cyber incidents across various business sectors, with some cases involving payouts of up to $100 million. The cyber-insurance market is forecasted to reach $14 billion in gross premiums by 2022, driven by the increasing profitability of cyber crimes and the growing awareness of board members about the limitations of preventive solutions. Additionally, global regulations like GDPR and CCPA, which mandate the handling of personally identifiable information, are creating further interest in cyber insurance.

While researchers and security experts debate the efficacy and implementation of cyber insurance, insurance companies are already offering it as part of their portfolios. This rapid market entry has led to a situation where existing tools and methodologies for assessing risk exposures and pricing are inadequate in the cyber domain. Although past studies suggest that most cyber risks are insurable, carriers lack solid methodologies, standards, and tools for accurate risk assessment, leading to evaluations that are often based on industry averages rather than specific customer needs.

### 1.2 Motivation

Researchers and practitioners have studied the main aspects, evolution, and challenges of cyber insurance for over two decades. Recent surveys, such as the one by Marotta et al., provide a comprehensive overview of the history, current status, and future directions of the cyber-insurance domain. However, there is a limited number of studies that leverage real data and the expertise of system security experts. For example, while other sectors use quantitative risk assessments, cybersecurity risks are typically evaluated using qualitative risk matrices based on expert opinions.

This paper aims to address this gap by providing an extensive discussion of the technical aspects and open challenges in the cyber-insurance domain. We highlight how security experts can contribute to this rapidly evolving area, emphasizing the distinction between risk assessment and risk prediction. We also identify several open research problems, such as identifying and collecting low-level risk indicators and capturing the risk introduced by supply chains, and discuss how these issues can be addressed through practical, data-driven solutions.

### 1.3 Structure of the Paper

Our study begins with an overview of the traditional insurance process, highlighting the main phases and actors and explaining the unique aspects of the cyber domain. We then review the existing literature on risk management, game-theoretical methods, economic studies, and previous work on predicting security events. In the second half of the paper, we introduce four main research areas where computer security expertise can support the cyber-insurance domain: risk prediction, automated data collection, catastrophe modeling, and computer forensics. Each section identifies the technical challenges and suggests concrete future research directions.

## 2. Prologue: From Insurance to Cyber Insurance

### 2.1 The Traditional Insurance Process

Insurance is a risk management method that converts the risk of harmful events into an expenditure. The process involves two main parties: the insurer (or insurance company) and the insured (or policyholder). The interaction occurs in two phases: underwriting and claiming for compensation. During underwriting, the insurer collects information to assess the client's risk class and defines the conditions, circumstances, and nature of the covered events. Coverage can include both first-party and third-party losses. The insurer then quantifies the potential material damage and sets the premium. The goal is to maintain a diversified portfolio to avoid catastrophic scenarios where a single incident affects a large fraction of clients. When a covered event occurs, the insured submits a claim, and the insurer validates it, assesses the impact, and provides compensation, possibly subject to a deductible.

### 2.2 Extending Insurances to the Cyber Domain

In the cyber domain, the underwriting process still relies on self-assessment questionnaires, checklists, business documentation, meetings, and interviews to gather information about the client's software, technologies, and security practices. However, the unique characteristics of cyber risks make it challenging to apply traditional actuarial techniques, as historical data and relevant contextual information are scarce. This section discusses the differences and challenges in each phase of the cyber-insurance process, highlighting the need for new methodologies and tools.
