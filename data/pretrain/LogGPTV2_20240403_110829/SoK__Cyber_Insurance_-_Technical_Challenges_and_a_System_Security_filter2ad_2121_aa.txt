Abstract—Cyber attacks have increased in number and complexity
in recent years, and companies and organizations have accordingly
raised their investments in more robust infrastructure to preserve
their data, assets and reputation. However, the full protection against
these countless and constantly evolving threats is unattainable by
the sole use of preventive measures. Therefore, to handle residual
risks and contain business losses in case of an incident, firms are
increasingly adopting a cyber insurance as part of their corporate
risk management strategy.
As a result, the cyber insurance sector – which offers to transfer
the financial risks related to network and computer incidents to a
third party – is rapidly growing, with recent claims that already
reached a $100M dollars. However, while other insurance sectors rely
on consolidated methodologies to accurately predict risks, the many
peculiarities of the cyber domain resulted in carriers to often resort
to qualitative approaches based on experts opinions.
This paper looks at past research conducted in the area of
cyber insurance and classifies previous studies in four different
areas, focused respectively on studying the economical aspects, the
mathematical models, the risk management methodologies, and the
predictions of cyber events. We then identify, for each insurance
phase, a group of practical research problems where security experts
can help develop new data-driven methodologies and automated tools
to replace the existing qualitative approaches.
I. INTRODUCTION
The modern society is highly dependent on Information and Com-
munication Technologies (ICT). However, despite its paramount
importance, the use of ICT also introduces a series of hazards. In
fact, computer systems and services are routinely compromised and
cyber incidents adversely impact many organizations, hampering
business-goal achievements and resulting in copious financial
losses [1]. For this reason, cybersecurity has quickly become
a subject of debate in executive boards [2] and companies are
increasingly investing in ICT security products [3]. Overall, the
security sector is expected to grow in 2019 to a 124 billion USD
market, with application security testing, data loss prevention, and
advanced threat protection representing the core investments [4].

Despite

and
rapidly-increasing effort,
is well understood that cyber
attacks cannot be prevented by technical solutions alone and
the protection against all possible threats is neither possible nor
economically feasible. Thus, in order to handle the residual risk,
organizations are rapidly moving towards managing their cyber
risk by incorporating cyber insurance into their multi-layer security
frameworks. Cyber insurance is defined to be the way to transfer the
financial risks related to network and computer incidents to a third
party [5]. Compared with traditional insurance policies for business
interruption and crime, a cyber-insurance policy can also cover, for
instance, digital data loss, damage and theft, as well as losses due
to network outages, computer failures, and website defacements.
A. A booming phenomenon missing solid foundations
As evinced by recent market reports, the adoption of cyber
insurance has tremendously increased over the last decade,
achieving an annual growth rate of over 30% since 2011 [6]. This
is also reflected in the growing number of claims submitted for
cyber incidents in a wide range of business sectors [7] and that,
in few striking cases, have seen insurance companies paying even
hundred-million-dollar indemnities [8].
Following this trend, the cyber-insurance market is forecasted
to reach 14 billion USD in gross premiums by 2022 [9] and
several indicators confirm this direction. First, cyber crimes have
never been so profitable [10] and the growing number of attacks
is increasing the awareness of board members about cyber risks
and the impossibility of only relying on preventive solutions [11].
This pushes a growing number of companies, among which even
more small- and medium-size enterprises, to start considering
cybersecurity insurance as a risk mitigation strategy: in fact, data
show that 66% of them would need to shut down if hit by a data
breach [12]. Another strong driver for the cyber-insurance domain
is the introduction of global regulations on personally identifiable
information loss, such as GDPR and CCPA. For instance, the need
to cover fines and the high cost of handling user notifications are
already creating interest in purchasing cyber insurance [13].
In other words, while researchers and security experts are still
debating whether cyber insurances even make sense and how they
could be better implemented, insurance companies are already
selling them as part of their portfolio. We may like it or not, but this
is already a reality – and as it often happens in our field, security
needs to catch up with an immature technology that was rushed
to the market. As we will see in the rest of the paper, companies
are currently struggling against the demand of cyber policies as
existing tools and methodologies to assess risk exposures and
pricing are inadequate in the cyber domain. Although past studies
have concluded that, without considering catastrophic scenarios,
the vast majority of cyber risks are insurable [14]–[16], carriers are
missing solid methodologies, standards, and tools to carry out their
measurements. The result, as we will comprehensively detail later
in this work, is that purely qualitative assessment of such risks leads
to inaccurate evaluations, not properly tailored to the customers but
mainly based on averages for their industrial sectors [17].

B. Motivation
Researchers and practitioners have studied the main aspects, the
evolution, and the core challenges of cyber insurance for more than
two decades [18]. Marotta et al. [19] recently published a survey in
which they discuss the history, current status, peculiarities, formaliza-
tion, and future directions of the cyber-insurance domain. However,
while researchers have extensively looked at the theoretical aspects
of the cyber ecosystem, there exists a very limited number of studies
that relied on real data and leveraged the domain expertise of system
security experts [20]–[29]. For example, as noted by Allodi et al [30],
while in other sectors risk assessment is based on quantitative estima-
tions, cybersecurity risks are typically computed by using qualitative
risk matrices that rely on subjective experts opinions. And this is just
the tip of the iceberg. Researchers have so far focused on understat-
ing if, and to what extent, a cyber-insurance market can be useful,
and which advantages and incentives it can bring to the different
parties and to the global ecosystem (both in economic and security
terms). However, very little has been done to explore how such insur-
ance schemes can be implemented in a rigorous and scientific way.
To cover this gap, this paper aims at providing an extensive
discussion of the technical aspects and open challenges in the
cyber-insurance domain, emphasizing how security experts can
contribute to this rapidly evolving area. For example, we will
discuss how, despite their apparent similarity, risk assessment
and risk prediction are not interchangeable concepts, and the
method provided by the first may fall short on the requirements
for accurately predicting future cyber incidents.
We believe the cyber-insurance field raises many technical
questions that require the expertise of system security researchers:
how can one identify and collect low-level risk indicators and
compare them with externally-observable events? Is it possible
to automatically extract dependencies among different software
and services and capture the risk introduced by the supply-chain
of a company? These are only two examples out of a long list
of open research problems we have identified throughout this
paper. Our main goal is to present a thorough discussion on these
problems such that researchers understand that to work properly
cyber insurance will require practical solutions that go well beyond
its economic and game-theoretical aspects.
C. Structure of the paper
Our study starts from the description of a classic insurance
process for the purpose of identifying its main phases and actors,
and clarifying the differences and peculiarities of the cyber domain
(section II). We will then look at the existing literature, covering
risk management and game theoretical methods, but also economic
studies and previous works that tried to predict security events. We
will try to clearly organize each contribution and point out which
part of the cyber-insurance puzzle it tries to address.
In the second half of the paper, we introduce four main research
areas where we believe that expertise in computer security can
support the cyber-insurance domain. This includes risk prediction
(Section V), automated data collection (Section VI), catastrophe
modeling (Section VII), and computer forensics (Section VIII).

II. PROLOGUE: FROM INSURANCE TO CYBER INSURANCE
A traditional insurance process includes several interacting
components, as depicted in the diagram reported in Figure 1. Even
though its main concepts and stages might be familiar to most
readers, for the sake of completeness, in this section, we briefly
provide the basic definitions. This short introduction allows us to
then discuss what makes cyber insurance unique compared to all
other types of insurances.
The Traditional Insurance process
Insurance is a risk management method whose main purpose
is to convert the risk of harmful events into an expenditure. The
insurance process generally involves two players: a first supply-side
entity who provides insurance, named insurer or insurance company,
and a second demand-side entity who buys the insurance, known
as insured or policyholder. The two parties interact in two different
phases, respectively identified as underwriting (or policy stipulation)
and claiming for compensation. During the drafting of a policy,
an insurance carrier needs to acquire useful information about the
prospective client with the purpose of identifying his risk class.
Afterwards, the two parties need to clearly define the conditions,
circumstances, and nature of the events that are covered by the policy.
Coverage can encompass both first- and third-party losses: while the
former is purchased to cover the policyholder against damages or
losses suffered by the insured to his person or property (e.g., health,
disability insurance), the latter is intended to protect the policyholder
against liability for damages or losses caused by the insured to other
people or their property (e.g., bystanders hit by insured’s car in an
accident, stranger’s properties damaged by a fire that comes out
of insured’s house). At this point, the insurer quantifies the material
damage that the insured — or third subjects if considered — would
be subjected to if these occurrences were to happen. Finally, the
insurance company takes on the liability and management of such
situations cashing a premium payout from the insured.

The management of client portfolios is another crucial task
insurance companies need to consider during the underwriting phase.
The goal is typically to maintain a pool of policies, each of them
having an independent probability of claim. This diversification
averts catastrophic scenarios in which a single incident impacts
a large fraction of the clients: in such cases, a significant number
of claims would be submitted at the same time and the insurance
would suffer a huge blow in covering losses. For instance, it may
not be a good strategy for an insurance company to insure against
fire hazards all apartments located in the same building.
Finally, when experiencing losses due to an incident which is
potentially covered by the insurance policy, the victim submits a
claim to the insurer who makes sure of its validity, assesses the
impact of the event and compensates the claimer with an indemnity
determined according to the terms of the policy. The contract can
also include a deductible, i.e., an amount for which the insured is
liable on each loss.
In order to make this entire process possible, the insurer must care-
fully set its tariffs to ensure that the premiums collected are enough
to cover future claims, in addition to yield profit for the insurance
firm itself. Unfortunately, this is anything but easy. Indeed, when it
comes to selling a finished product or service, a firm can easily deter-
mine its price knowing which costs have been incurred for its realiza-
tion. On the contrary, an insurer who places its product on the market
does not know in advance the amount of money required for claim
compensations because of their inherent uncertain nature. In this
respect, actuarial techniques allow to estimate these disbursements
and overcome the cost uncertainty related to this inverted production
cycle. A key element for this estimation relies on statistical methods
that study how claims for covered events have evolved over the previ-
ous years to forecast their future evolution. Thus, the raw information
required to build a classic insurance product consists of a large set
of historical records containing claims and compensations for events
which have similar characteristics to the ones being insured. Insur-
ance firms usually do not rely only on their own data sources but also
take advantage of the market statistics that aggregate historical data
of other companies in the same domain. This statistical information,
which normally goes under the name of actuarial data, is what
allows an insurance company to estimate the risk of a certain event or
client, given a number of relevant contextual information (acquired
during the underwriting phase). This includes, for instance, the
driver’s age and neighborhood for a car insurance or the age of the
building in a house insurance. Unfortunately, as we will discuss next,
actuarial data are scarce in the cyber domain and the characteristics
that need to be collected about a client (and that presumably are
good predictors for future incidents) are not yet well understood.
Extending Insurances to the Cyber Domain
With the help of Figure 1, we now look more closely at how the
previous process is applied to the cyber domain by discussing the
differences and the main challenges that affect each insurance phase.
Underwriting – As we discussed above, the policy underwriting
requires the insurer to collect information from the client that can
be useful for the purpose of risk assessment. Following a traditional
model, also in the cyber domain this is still performed by a mix of
self-assessment questionnaires, checklists, business documentation,
meetings, and interviews [31]–[36], whose objective is to identify
the adopted software and technologies, the deployed security
