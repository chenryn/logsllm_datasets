the design of our system and its evaluation spans across a wide range of modern
mobile phones. The complete dataset is available at http://www.nexginrc.org.
For all the analysis provided later in the paper, we use a dataset of 25 users
spanning over 7 days. We quantify the keystrokes into a proﬁle of 250 key-hits6
each, which we call a ‘Key hit proﬁle’. Table 1 shows that people from diﬀerent
walks of life have diﬀerent number of key hit proﬁles in accordance with their
social status. We observe that students, teenagers and professionals use keyboard
of mobile phones aggressively while senior citizens and managers use keyboard
of mobile phone less frequently. For instance, users u10, u14, and u15 have more
than 50 key hit proﬁles while users u1, u3, u16, u17, and u19 make less than 20
key hit proﬁles over the same period of 7 days.
After successfully collecting the dataset, we started the next phase of our re-
search – systematically analyzing our raw data to extract useful features for user
identiﬁcation. We observed that some people tend to type faster with less errors
as compared to others, while some others type very slowly which is uniquely
linked to their social status and age as shown in Table 1. Based on this prelimi-
nary analysis, we observed that if we can identify a keystroke dynamics feature
set that covers all aspects of a persons’ unique typing pattern, we can actually
identify the mobile phone user. Therefore, we extracted 6 features to correctly
identify a user – 2 of these features have been borrowed from the desktop domain
while the remaining 4 are customized for mobile phones’ multiplexed keypads.
A detailed discussion of this features’ set is provided in the next section.
6 A justiﬁcation for this proﬁle size is given during the discussion of experiments.

4 Feature Selection and Study of Desktop-Based Schemes
In this section, we ﬁrst analyze three well-known features that have been used for
user identiﬁcation on desktop/laptop computers. We then customize these fea-
tures for mobile phones. Finally, we evaluate the accuracies of existing keystroke-
based user identiﬁcation schemes in identifying mobile phone users.
4.1 Feature Selection
After collecting data of the mobile phone users, we extracted three features
from this data – key hold time, digraph, and error rate. These features have
been used for keystroke-based user identiﬁcation for desktop/laptop computers
[17],[14]. However, their usability to identify a legitimate user on mobile phones
has not been explored before. These features are deﬁned as:
Key hold time. The time diﬀerence between pressing a key and releasing it;
Digraph time. The time diﬀerence between releasing one key and pressing the
next one; and
Error rate. The number of times backspace key is pressed.
We observed that identifying a user based on these three features is less chal-
lenging on desktops because of a relatively distinguished feature vector for each
user. As an example, we installed a key-logging application on the laptops of
6 users for a period of 5 days. The plot of these three features extracted from
the desktop key logging data of 6 users is shown in Figure 1. It can be observed
that the features’ set on desktops is well segregated and poses a relatively simple
classiﬁcation problem. However, once we extracted the same three features from
the mobile phone data of 25 users, their feature vectors are extremely diﬀused
as shown in Figure 1(a). Keystroke-based user identiﬁcation problem is more
challenging on mobile phones because they generally have multiplexed keys in
a 4 × 3 matrix. In order to make the data less diﬀused, we split the feature
“digraph” into four types of digraphs as follows:

Horizontal Digraph (Da
h). This is the time elapsed between releasing a key
and pressing the adjacent key in the same horizontal row of keys, e.g. the time
between key 1 and key 2, key 5 and key 6, key 0 and key * etc.;
Vertical Digraph (Da
v). This is the time elapsed between releasing a key and
pressing the adjacent key in the same vertical column of keys, e.g. the time be-
tween key 1 and key 4, key 5 and key 8, key # and key 9 etc.;
Non-adjacent Horizontal Digraph (Dna
h ). This is the time elapsed between
releasing a key and pressing the next in the same horizontal row such that the
keys are separated by another key, e.g. time between key 1 and key 3, key 4 and
key 6, key * and key # etc.; and
Non-adjacent Vertical Digraph (Dna
v ). This is the time elapsed between
releasing a key and pressing the next in the same vertical column such that the
keys are separated by another key, e.g. the time between key 1 and key 7, key 0
and key 5, key 3 and key 9 etc.
Once we extracted these features, we calculated the coeﬃcient of variation
(cv) for each feature to determine variation and randomness in the features’
data. From Table 1, we can observe that the coeﬃcient of variation of the key
hold time feature for 25 diﬀerent users is very small (order of 10−2) which high-
lights that users normally press keys for approximately the same length of time.
However, this parameter is signiﬁcantly higher for digraph times. The coeﬃcient
of variation of more than 1 shows large randomness in the data. Therefore, in
order to correctly classify a user based on this collective feature set, we need a
classiﬁer that can identify classiﬁcation boundaries for this highly varying data
which is a result of diﬀused usage patterns of diﬀerent users.
4.2 Accuracy Evaluation of Existing Techniques
As a next logical step, we investigate the accuracy of existing classiﬁcation
schemes, developed for desktop computers, on the mobile phones’ dataset. To this
end, we evaluate ﬁve prominent classiﬁers proposed in [24],[22],[13],[29],[8],[23].
These classiﬁers are quite diverse. Naive Bayes [24] is a probabilistic classiﬁer;
while Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) [22] and Radial Basis Function
Network (RBFN) [13] belong to the category of neural networks. In comparison,
Kstar [8] is a statistical classiﬁer and J48 [23] is a decision tree classiﬁer. In order
to remove any implementation related bias, we have performed our experiments
in WEKA [29].
Ideally, we need a classiﬁer that classiﬁes a user as legitimate or imposter
with 100% accuracy. In our current accuracy evaluation setup, the errors are
of two types: (1) False Acceptance Rate (FAR) is deﬁned as the probability
that an imposter is classiﬁed as a legitimate user, and (2) False Rejection Rate
(FRR) is deﬁned as the probability that a legitimate user is classiﬁed as an
imposter.
The results of our experiments are tabulated in Table 2. We can see that the
existing classiﬁers provide an FAR of 30-40% which is not acceptable. Similarly,
FRR of most of the classiﬁers is approximately 30% or more and this again
