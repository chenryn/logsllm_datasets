Hello,
I have found that when I use the `frame: false` option and then create a
custom titlebar with window control buttons I cannot resize the window on the
top-side.  
This might happen because you have to set the titlebar to be draggable with
`-webkit-app-region: no-drag;`.
I am using electron-version v0.36.2 on Fedora 23 with Gnome-Shell.
Does anyone else experience this problem?
