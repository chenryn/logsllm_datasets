Subject: Issue with Resizing Window When Using Custom Titlebar in Electron

Hello,

I have encountered an issue while using the `frame: false` option to create a custom title bar with window control buttons. Specifically, I am unable to resize the window from the top side.

I suspect this problem might be related to the need to set the title bar as draggable using `-webkit-app-region: no-drag;`.

Here are the details of my setup:
- Electron version: v0.36.2
- Operating System: Fedora 23
- Desktop Environment: Gnome-Shell

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Any suggestions or workarounds would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
