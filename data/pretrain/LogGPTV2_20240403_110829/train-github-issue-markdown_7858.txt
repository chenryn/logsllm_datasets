Strict mypy mode gives such errors:
    base/api/users/controllers.py:4: error: Module 'fastapi' has no attribute 'Depends'
    base/api/users/controllers.py:4: error: Module 'fastapi' has no attribute 'HTTPException'
on such import statement:
    from fastapi import Depends, HTTPException
Tried using
    from fastapi import Depends as Depends
    from fastapi import HTTPException as HTTPException
as per recommendations in tiangolo/typer#112 discussion. But the errors
remain.
It seems that adding **all** to the **init**.py files for the stuff that's
reexported is a way to go (as per python/mypy#7042 discussion).
Thanks for considering this!
