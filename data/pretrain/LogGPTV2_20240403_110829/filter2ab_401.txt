**ATT&CK ID:** G0087  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** APT39

APT39 has been known to use malware to set the `LoadAppInit_DLLs` value in the `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` registry key, thereby establishing persistence on the compromised system. [4]

### Explanation:
- **APT39**: An advanced persistent threat (APT) group.
- **Malware**: Malicious software used by APT39 to gain and maintain access to a target system.
- **Registry Key**: The specific location in the Windows Registry where the `LoadAppInit_DLLs` value is modified.
- **Persistence**: The ability of the malware to remain active and undetected on the system, even after reboots.

This technique allows APT39 to ensure that their malicious code is loaded each time the system starts, thus maintaining long-term access to the compromised machine.
