### How to Change the Interval of atop Log on CentOS 7.4

**Question:**
I want to change the `atop` log interval from the default 600 seconds (10 minutes) to 300 seconds (5 minutes). My system is running CentOS 7.4 with `atop` version 2.3.0.

**Current Configuration:**

1. **/usr/share/atop/atop.daily:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   CURDAY=`date +%Y%m%d`
   LOGPATH=/var/log/atop
   BINPATH=/usr/bin
   PIDFILE=/var/run/atop.pid
   INTERVAL=600  # interval 10 minutes

   # Support /etc/sysconfig/atop
   source /etc/sysconfig/atop
   ```

2. **/etc/sysconfig/atop:**
   ```bash
   CURDAY=`date +%Y%m%d`
   # Log files path
   LOGPATH=/var/log/atop
   # Binaries path
   BINPATH=/usr/bin
   # PID File
   PIDFILE=/var/run/atop.pid
   # Interval (default 10 minutes)
   INTERVAL=600
   ```

Both files have the `INTERVAL` set to 600 seconds. Which file should I modify to change the interval?

**Answer:**

To change the `atop` log interval, you should modify the `/etc/sysconfig/atop` file. The `atop.daily` script sources this configuration file, so any changes made in `/etc/sysconfig/atop` will be applied.

**Steps to Change the Interval:**

1. Open the `/etc/sysconfig/atop` file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/atop
   ```

2. Locate the `INTERVAL` line and change its value from `600` to `300`:
   ```bash
   INTERVAL=300
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Restart the `atop` service to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart atop
   ```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use the `LOGINTERVAL` variable, you can add or modify it in the `/etc/sysconfig/atop` file as follows:

```bash
LOGINTERVAL=60  # 60 seconds, which is equivalent to 300 seconds for 5 minutes
```

Then, ensure that the `atop.daily` script uses the `LOGINTERVAL` variable. If it does not, you may need to modify the script to use `LOGINTERVAL` instead of `INTERVAL`.

**Note:**
- The `atop.daily` script expects the `LOGINTERVAL` variable to override the `INTERVAL` setting. If you choose to use `LOGINTERVAL`, make sure the script is configured to use this variable.
- After making these changes, verify that the `atop` logs are being generated at the new interval by checking the log files in `/var/log/atop`.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully change the `atop` log interval to 300 seconds (5 minutes).
