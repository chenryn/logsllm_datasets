User: I had this problem for a while, and finally understanding what caused it was a good relief. 
So basically, python files with a dash ('-') in their name are not fully analyzed by PyDev. I only get the errors but not the warnings... (ie: unused variables, unused imports etc...)
Is this a feature? a known bug? Is there any work around?
I know that the dash is not allowed for python folder but does this apply for python files? (in my case, those are python scripts, without the .py extension for convenience).
For instance, in my bin project subfolder:

commit or release script files are analysed A-OK
add-input, select-files: warning are not reported.

Thanks for any hint on that.
Assistant: Python does not allow dashes in identifiers. Module names need to be valid identifiers, so any module file or package directory name with a dash in it is not importable.
On the other hand, script files (python files executed directly by Python, not imported) have no such restrictions. I'd say what you encountered is a bug in PyDev and you should report it as such.
