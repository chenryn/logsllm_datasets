User: I'm new to scons and Python.
I was wondering if there's a way to invoke scons from within a python script. 
My python script accepts from the user, a list of directories where the code to be compiled together is located (in addition to doing some other non-trivial things).
It also generates a string which is to be used as a name of the executable created
by scons.
I want to pass this information from my python script to scons, and then invoke scons.
Is there a simple way to do this?
I can think of the following possibilities:

use subprocess.call("scons"...) I'm not sure if scons accepts all the info I need to pass as command line arguments
have the python script write into a file. Have the SConscript parse the file and get the information passed.
Assistant: Thanks for the answers. I ended up using this method:
The python script writes a list of options into a text file, closes it, and invokes scons -f MySConscript_file using a subprocess call. The SConstruct reads values from the text file into a list, and uses them.
