Hello,

I recently opened the `variables.less` file in Visual Studio and encountered some syntax errors. 

It seems that the comments are using `//**` instead of the correct syntax for CSS and Less, which is `/* Comment */`.

Could you please update the comments by changing `//**` to `/*` or simply remove the `*`? This should resolve the syntax errors.

Thank you!
