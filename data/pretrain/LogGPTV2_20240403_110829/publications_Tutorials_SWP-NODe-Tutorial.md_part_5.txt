Web Service Discovery, handling semantic heterogeneity
 Adding semantics to different layers of Web services
 Operational perspective conceptual stack

Conclusions Semantic Web Processes
 Semantics can help address big challenges related to
scalability, dynamic environments.
 But comprehensive approach to semantics will be
needed:
 Data/information, function/operation, execution, QoS Questions?

tools and capabilities that we did not have in EAI,
