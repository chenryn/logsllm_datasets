Question: While customizing SELinux policies for an Android device, you encounter the following denial:

avc: denied { open } for pid=1003 comm="mediaserver" path="/dev/kgsl-3d0" dev="tmpfs" scontext=u:r:mediaserver:s0 tcontext=u:object_r:device:s0 tclass=chr_file permissive=1

To address this denial appropriately, which of the following actions should you take?
"A": "Assign a more specific label to '/dev/kgsl-3d0', such as 'gpu_device', and ensure the mediaserver has the necessary permissions to access the 'gpu_device'.",
"B": "Create a new allow rule in the SELinux policy that grants the mediaserver domain access to the 'device' type for all character files in '/dev'.",
"C": "Use audit2allow to generate a policy that allows mediaserver to open any file with the 'device' context, and implement this policy.",
"D": "Ignore the denial as it occurs in permissive mode and focus on other denials that may appear when the device is in enforcing mode."
Answer: A
