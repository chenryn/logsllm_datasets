Let ˆFj = Uj ∩ Fj be the event that bj is a Nakamoto block. Then we

(22)
which is the event that the adversary launches a private attack
starting from bi and catches up the fictitious honest chain right
before bk is mined. The following lemma shows that event ˆFj can
be represented with ˆBik’s.

Finally, define the parameter r as follows:

r := λa

for which r  s + ∆. To prove this, first observe that minimizing
the increase in L(p) is equivalent to maximizing the time it takes
for C(p) to reach any depth d. Now, let hi be the block at the tip
of C(p) when it reaches depth d, and, assume that it took δi ≤ ∆
time for p to learn about hi after it was mined. Then, C(p) reaches
depth d at time τ h
+ δi. However, if the message for hi was delayed
i
i > δi time, then, either C(p) would have reached depth d at
for δ′
i ≥ τ h
time τ h
+ δi with block hi at its tip, or, another block hj,
i
with index j (cid:44) i would have brought C(p) to depth d at some time
+ δ′
t, τ h
+ δi. Hence, delaying the transmission of hi
i > t > τ h
i
i
increases the time it takes for C(p) to reach depth d. This implies
that hi should be delayed as long as possible, which is ∆. Since this
argument also applies to any other block hj that might also bring
C(p) to depth d when hi is delayed, every block should be delayed
by ∆ to maximize the time for C(p) to reach any depth d. This, in
turn, minimizes the increase in L(p) by any time t > s.
+ δ′

Next, define the following random variable:
(p)(t)).
Lmax(t) = max
p=1, ..,n
(L
Then, we can assert that;
Lmax(t − ∆) ≤ L
(p)(t) ≤ Lmax(t)
for any honest miner p. Then,
(p)(t) − L
(p)(s) ≥ Lmax(t − ∆) − Lmax(s).
L
From the paragraph above, we know that delaying every honest
block by ∆ minimizes L(p)(t) for any t. Hence, this action also
minimizes L(p)(t) − L(p)(s) for any t > s + 2∆. Now, assume that
no honest miner hears about any adversary block in the interval
[s, t] and every honest block is delayed by ∆. Then, the difference
Lmax(t − ∆) − Lmax(s) will be solely due the honest blocks that
arrive within the period [s, t − ∆]. However, in this case, depth of
Lmax changes via the same process as Dh (when each miner has
infinitesimal power), which implies the following inequality:
Lmax(t − ∆) − Lmax(s) ≥ Dh(t − ∆) − Dh(s + ∆).
Hence, we see that when every block is delayed by ∆ and there are
no adversary blocks heard by p in the time interval [s, t];
(p)(t) − L
L
(p)(s) ≥ Dh(t − ∆) − Dh(s + ∆).
However, delaying honest blocks less than ∆ time or the arrival of
adversary blocks to p in the period[s, t] only increases the difference
L(p)(t) − L(p)(s). Consequently;
Dh(t − ∆) − Dh(s + ∆) ≤ L
(p)(t) − L
(p)(s)
for any honest miner p.

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3.2.
Proof. We prove that the j-th honest block will be included in
any future chain C(t) for t > τ h
+ ∆, by contradiction. Suppose
i
ˆFj occurs and let t∗ > τ h
+ ∆ be the smallest t such that the j-th
honest block is not contained in C(p)(t) for some 1 ≤ p ≤ n. Let
hi be the last honest block on C(p)(t∗), which must exist, because
the genesis block is by definition honest. If τ h
+ ∆ for hi,
then, C(p)(τ h−
) is the prefix of C(p)(t∗) before block hi, and, does
i
not contain the j-th honest block, contradicting the minimality of
t∗. Therefore, hi must be mined before time τ h
+ ∆. Since the j-th
honest block is a loner, we further know that hi must be mined
before time τ h
, implying that hi is the i-th honest block for some

Proof is by using Chernoff bound, and, optimizing for the value

C.1 Proof of Lemma 4.5
The proof is based on random walk theory.
Proof. We would like to lower bound the probability that the
j-th honest block is a loner and Fj happens. Since the j-th honest
block is a loner with probability e−2λh ∆ > 0 for all j, the probability
that it is a Nakamoto block can be expressed as
P(Fj | j-th honest block is a loner) · e
−2λh ∆
Then, the proof is reduced to obtaining a lower bound on
P(Fj | j-th honest block is a loner).
For this purpose, we assume that the j-th honest block is a loner,
and, proceed to obtain a lower bound on the probability of the event
Fj:
For any adversary tree Ti, i  τ h

Let Uj be the event that the j-th honest block is a loner. Let
Gj be the event that no adversary block is mined within the time

period [τ h
P(Fj|Uj) in the following way:

P(Fj|Uj) ≥ P(Fj ∩ Gj|Uj) = e

P(Fj|Uj , Gj) is equal to the probability of the following event ˆFj:
