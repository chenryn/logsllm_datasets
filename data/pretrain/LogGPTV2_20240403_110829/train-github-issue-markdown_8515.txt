Consider a widget that conditionally depends on an InheritedModel aspect:
    if (foo) {
      return Text("Foo", MyModel.of(context, aspect: MyAspect));
    }
It seems that if `foo` requirement is met once. Then even if that condition
fails in the future; the widget will stay dependent on the MyModel.
This leads to unnecessary builds. I'd expect the list of dependencies to be
cleared before `build` call
