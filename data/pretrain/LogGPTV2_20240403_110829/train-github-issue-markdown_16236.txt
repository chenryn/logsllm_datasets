##### Detailed description
Video is 06.933 sec long with 25 FPS, what makes 173 frames (observed in video
player)
However :
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)
gives 172 frames. And while counting manual:
    while(cap.isOpened()):
            ret, frame = cap.read()
            if ret == True:
                frame_index += 1
            else: 
                break
it can't go any further than 168 frame
Sadly I can't share the video file
