diet NAFLD is defined as from mild liver steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) NASH may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma Recent studies have proposed dysbiosis as the critical factor for NAFLD Dysbiosis causes endothelial barrier dysfunction and leads 
to leaky gut Compromised gut barrier allows the translocation of bacteria and bacteria-derived molecules to liver through portal vein Colonic 
homeostasis is closely related with intestinal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) which are the fermentation end-products by gut microbiota Especially, 
butyrate is the most important energy source for enterocytes and contributes to colonic homeostasis In current study, we applied four different 
combination of mass-spectrometric platforms to comprehensively measure a range of metabolic features and some key known factors We first 
evaluated pharmabiotic effect on the mice fed with western-diet by oral administration of 6 probiotics Indeed, we observed the coordinated 
changes in SCFAs levels from cecal samples Based on multivariate statistical model, we putatively identified metabolites indicating strong 
positive correlation with the SCFA alteration Finally, we monitored the modulation of primary and secondary bile acids that may provide detailed 
mechanistic in molecular dynamics between gut and liver

Paroxetine treatment in mice increases fecal bile acid levels that correlate with behavior
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Frederik Dethloff, MPI of Psychiatry, Germany

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used drugs to treat major depressive disorder Since SSRIs are drugs that are taken 
orally it is conceivable that they can affect gut microbiota and their functions and thereby impact other body organs In this regard it has now 
become increasingly clear that microbiota communicate with the central nervous system through the gut-brain-axis Several reports have shown 
that a distorted gut microbiota composition that is mediated by its secreted molecular constituents can impact the central nervous system and 
contribute to the development of psychiatric disorders We treated DBA/2J mice for 2 weeks with the SSRI paroxetine and assessed their behavioral 
response with the forced swim test (FST) and the light-dark box test (LDB) In order to investigate paroxetine’s effects on the gut microbiota we 
analyzed fecal pellets as a proxy In addition to 16S rRNA we interrogated by tandem mass spectrometry the metabolite profiles of fecal pellet 
extracts Untargeted metabolite profiling of drug- and vehicle-treated mice revealed altered levels of features that belong to the bile acid class and 
have a strong correlation with behavioral measures No significant alterations of the taxa occured in response to the two week paroxetine treatment 
Microbiota-derived metabolites may constitute biomarkers able to predict paroxetine treatment response

In recent years, microbiome research has dramatically reshaped our understanding of how microbes impact on a multitude of (patho-)physiological 
processes in the host However, causal links are still lacking to a large extent Metabolomics allows the investigation of microbial metabolic 
activities, and is thus the ideal technology to assess functional nutrition-microbiota-host crosstalk Here, we discuss the application of a newly 
developed targeted assay for the quantification of endogenous and microbiota-derived metabolites 10 µl human plasma and fecal samples were 
analyzed by a standardized, quantitative assay in kit format allowing for the analysis of 630 metabolites 106 small molecules from 13 compound 
classes are analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), hexoses and 523 lipids from 12 lipid classes by flow-
injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) on an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC – SCIEX QTRAP® 5500 MetIDQ™ software was used 
for the entire automated workflow In plasma, more than 455 metabolites were quantified above LOD with high, and more than 120 metabolites in 
fecal samples To a large extent, the small molecules and lipids quantified in feces overlap with those in plasma A higher number of lipids, especially 
phosphatidylcholines and triglycerides, were quantified in plasma compared to fecal samples In addition to endogenous metabolites, a multitude 
of microbiota-derived metabolites were quantified The capability to quantify microbiota-derived metabolites in blood and fecal samples allows for 
correlation studies also with data from other omics technologies to investigate functional nutrition-microbiome-host interplay for uncovering causal 
links to pathophysiological processes, disease development, and response to drug treatment

Developing an optimal fecal extraction protocol to maximize metabolite coverage for metabolomics studies
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mary Boyce, Edith Cowan University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Jessica Pandohee, Claus T Christopherson, David I Broadhurst
Background: Metabolomics is the analysis and unbiased relative quantification of all metabolites in a biological sample In order to study the 
entire metabolome of a biological system, it is essential that most, if not all, of the metabolites present in the system in question are extracted 
Human stool is a complex solid sample making reproducible extraction of metabolites challenging The aim of this work was to develop extraction 
methods that maximize the metabolite coverage for untargeted and semi-targeted metabolomics studies Methods: To investigate the effect of 
solvent polarity on the metabolite extraction coverage, homogenised fecal samples (100 mg) were individually extracted with 200 L solvent 
The supernatant was dried and the residue derivatised using methoxyamine in pyridine followed by MSTFA The samples were analysed on a 
ThermoFisher Q-Exactive GC-MS The metabolites were identified using both our in-house library of 400 metabolites and NIST Results: Of the 
16 solvents tested, water (pH 2), methanol and acetone extracted 91, 102 and 91 respectively of the 400 analytes in our in-house library with 
RSD 09995) 
After treatment of DDP-4 inhibitor, healthy subjects showed relative intensity increase in 9 endogenous metabolites, dihydroxyfumaric acid, 
tyrosylthreonine, glutamine, leucylproline, ethylglycine, threonic acid, n-methyl-l-glutamic acid, methionylalanine, and kynurenic acid 5 endogenous 
metabolites, including histidinal, arabinonic acid, phenylalanylalanine, alanylhydroxyproline, and capryloylglycine were significantly down 
regulated after treatment Among the putative markers, 5 dipeptides showed differences after treatment DPP-4 preferentially cleaves Xaa-Pro 
or Xaa-Ala dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides and preventing the degradation of incretin hormones, by DPP-4 inhibition, speculated 
relative intensity of dipeptides change in postdose In this study, pharmacometabolomics provides powerful tools for identifying effects of global 
metabolomics profiling by DPP-4 inhibitor treatment

CO-AUTHORS: Buszewska-Forajta Magdalena, Szybiak Aleksandra, Kowalewska Agnieszka, Rachoń Dominik, Markuszewski Michał Jan
Despite such a high incidence, the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome still remains unexplained PCOS is multifactorial disorder, which is 
diagnosed in about 10% of women of reproductive age It is connected with ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovaries appearance and also with 
higher level of androgens concentration Therefore, PCOS is one of the main reasons of female infertility Besides to endocrine dysfunction, it may 
cause the development of different metabolic disorders The use of the metabolomic approach in a field of PCOS aims to identify specific metabolic 
pathways potentially involved in the pathophysiology of this frequent disorder Determination and comparison of the metabolic profiles of serum 
samples obtained from women with PCOS and healthy controls was the main aim of this study Untargeted metabolomic analysis was conducted 
with the use two complementary analytical techniques: liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry Next 
step was identification metabolites specific for biochemical pathways disturbed in PCOS Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis showed 
the difference of metabolic profiles in studied groups of women During the untargeted metabolomic analysis of serum samples, a few metabolites 
connected with metabolic disorders of amino acids, carbohydrates, steroid hormones, lipids, purines and citric acid cycle were identified 
Understanding the pathomechanism of this syndrome and the identification of new potential biomarkers of PCOS will contribute to its early 
recognition and effective treatment

Metabolic characterization and predictive model construction for partial hepatectomy mortality in porcine model
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hyung Do Kwon, Kookmin University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Do Yup Lee
The molecular and cellular mechanism in liver regeneration process following partial hepatectomy has been well known; however, hepatectomy 
mortality still remains significant problem in clinics Therefore, we explored metabolic features reflected in serum metabolite after partial 
hepatectomy in porcine model Pig shares the similarity in anatomy and physiology with human so it has been regarded as a proper model for liver 
study In this study, based on gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS), primary metabolite profile was acquired from 
three groups, sham, 70%, and 90% liver resection groups Un-supervised multivariate statistics revealed distinctive profiles of the three groups 
And subsequent modeling based on orthogonal projection in latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) proposed key molecular features 
that discriminated hepatectomy mortality The linear combination with malic acid and methionine showed the best predictive power in which the 
area under the curve (AUC) ranged from 0939 to 0989 The current study provides the understanding of liver regeneration and metabolic capacity 
impaired by hepatectomy

Orbital lymphoproliferative diseases, particularly mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and IgG4-related ocular disease (IgG4-
ROD), have similar clinical and also histopathological features, and are therefore often difficult to differentiate In this study, we conducted 
metabolomic profiling of IgG4-ROD and MALT lymphoma tissue samples Six samples of orbital MALT lymphoma (mean age 623 years; 4 males and
