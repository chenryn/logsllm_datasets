### Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and the Role of Dysbiosis

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of conditions, ranging from mild liver steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH can progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent studies have highlighted dysbiosis as a critical factor in the development of NAFLD. Dysbiosis leads to endothelial barrier dysfunction, resulting in a "leaky gut." This compromised gut barrier allows the translocation of bacteria and their byproducts to the liver via the portal vein. Colonic homeostasis is closely linked to the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by gut microbiota. Among these, butyrate is particularly important as it serves as a key energy source for enterocytes and contributes to colonic health.

In our current study, we utilized four different mass-spectrometric platforms to comprehensively measure a range of metabolic features and key known factors. We first evaluated the effect of pharmabiotics on mice fed a Western diet by administering six probiotics orally. We observed coordinated changes in SCFA levels in cecal samples. Using multivariate statistical models, we identified metabolites that showed strong positive correlations with SCFA alterations. Additionally, we monitored the modulation of primary and secondary bile acids, which provided insights into the molecular dynamics between the gut and liver.

### Paroxetine Treatment in Mice and Its Impact on Fecal Bile Acid Levels and Behavior

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine, are commonly used to treat major depressive disorder. Since SSRIs are administered orally, they can potentially affect gut microbiota and their functions, thereby impacting other body organs. It is increasingly clear that the gut microbiota communicates with the central nervous system through the gut-brain axis. Altered gut microbiota composition, mediated by its secreted molecular constituents, can impact the central nervous system and contribute to psychiatric disorders.

We treated DBA/2J mice with paroxetine for two weeks and assessed their behavioral responses using the forced swim test (FST) and the light-dark box test (LDB). To investigate the effects of paroxetine on the gut microbiota, we analyzed fecal pellets. In addition to 16S rRNA analysis, we used tandem mass spectrometry to profile the metabolites in fecal pellet extracts. Untargeted metabolite profiling revealed altered levels of bile acid features that strongly correlated with behavioral measures. No significant alterations in taxa were observed after two weeks of paroxetine treatment. These findings suggest that microbiota-derived metabolites may serve as biomarkers to predict paroxetine treatment response.

Recent advances in microbiome research have significantly enhanced our understanding of how microbes influence various (patho-)physiological processes in the host. However, causal links remain largely unestablished. Metabolomics, which investigates microbial metabolic activities, is an ideal technology for assessing functional interactions between nutrition, the microbiota, and the host. Here, we discuss the application of a newly developed targeted assay for quantifying endogenous and microbiota-derived metabolites.

Human plasma and fecal samples (10 µl each) were analyzed using a standardized, quantitative assay in kit format, capable of analyzing 630 metabolites. The assay includes 106 small molecules from 13 compound classes analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and hexoses and 523 lipids from 12 lipid classes analyzed by flow-injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) on an Agilent 1290 Infinity UHPLC – SCIEX QTRAP® 5500. MetIDQ™ software was used for the automated workflow.

In plasma, more than 455 metabolites were quantified above the limit of detection (LOD) with high precision, and more than 120 metabolites were quantified in fecal samples. There was a significant overlap in the small molecules and lipids quantified in both plasma and feces, with a higher number of lipids, especially phosphatidylcholines and triglycerides, quantified in plasma. The ability to quantify microbiota-derived metabolites in both blood and fecal samples allows for correlation studies with other omics data, facilitating the investigation of functional nutrition-microbiome-host interplay and uncovering causal links to pathophysiological processes, disease development, and drug treatment responses.

### Developing an Optimal Fecal Extraction Protocol for Metabolomics Studies

Metabolomics involves the analysis and unbiased relative quantification of all metabolites in a biological sample. To study the entire metabolome, it is essential to extract most, if not all, of the metabolites present in the system. Human stool is a complex solid sample, making reproducible extraction challenging. Our aim was to develop extraction methods that maximize metabolite coverage for untargeted and semi-targeted metabolomics studies.

To investigate the effect of solvent polarity on metabolite extraction, homogenized fecal samples (100 mg) were individually extracted with 200 µL of 16 different solvents. The supernatant was dried, and the residue was derivatized using methoxyamine in pyridine followed by MSTFA. The samples were analyzed using a ThermoFisher Q-Exactive GC-MS, and metabolites were identified using both our in-house library of 400 metabolites and the NIST database. Water (pH 2), methanol, and acetone extracted 91, 102, and 91 analytes, respectively, with RSD < 0.9995.

### Determination of Metabolic Profiles of Serum Samples from Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)

Despite its high incidence, the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains poorly understood. PCOS, a multifactorial disorder diagnosed in about 10% of women of reproductive age, is characterized by ovulatory dysfunction, polycystic ovaries, and elevated androgen levels. It is a leading cause of female infertility and is associated with various metabolic disorders. Metabolomic approaches aim to identify specific metabolic pathways involved in PCOS pathophysiology.

Our study aimed to determine and compare the metabolic profiles of serum samples from women with PCOS and healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomic analysis was conducted using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses revealed differences in the metabolic profiles of the two groups. Several metabolites related to amino acids, carbohydrates, steroid hormones, lipids, purines, and the citric acid cycle were identified. Understanding the pathomechanism of PCOS and identifying new potential biomarkers will contribute to early recognition and effective treatment.

### Metabolic Characterization and Predictive Model Construction for Partial Hepatectomy Mortality in a Porcine Model

**Presenting Author: Hyung Do Kwon, Kookmin University, South Korea**

**Co-Author: Do Yup Lee**

While the molecular and cellular mechanisms of liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy are well understood, hepatectomy mortality remains a significant clinical problem. We explored the metabolic features reflected in serum metabolites after partial hepatectomy in a porcine model. Pigs, due to their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, are considered appropriate models for liver studies.

Using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS), we acquired primary metabolite profiles from three groups: sham, 70% liver resection, and 90% liver resection. Unsupervised multivariate statistics revealed distinct profiles among the three groups. Subsequent modeling based on orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) identified key molecular features that discriminated hepatectomy mortality. The linear combination of malic acid and methionine showed the best predictive power, with an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.939 to 0.989. This study provides insights into liver regeneration and the metabolic capacity impaired by hepatectomy.

Orbital lymphoproliferative diseases, particularly mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and IgG4-related ocular disease (IgG4-ROD), share similar clinical and histopathological features, making differentiation challenging. In this study, we conducted metabolomic profiling of tissue samples from patients with IgG4-ROD and MALT lymphoma. Six samples of orbital MALT lymphoma (mean age 62.3 years; 4 males and 2 females) and six samples of IgG4-ROD (mean age 61.5 years; 3 males and 3 females) were analyzed. Our findings provide a metabolic signature that can help differentiate between these two conditions, contributing to more accurate diagnosis and treatment.
