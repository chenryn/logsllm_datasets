Abstract. Active and passive measurements for topology discovery have
known an impressive growth during the last decade. If a lot of work has
been done regarding inter-domain topology discovery and modeling, only
a few papers raise the question of how to extract intra-domain topologies
from measurements results.
In this paper, based on a large dataset collected with mrinfo, a mul-
ticast tool that silently discovers all interfaces of a router, we provide a
mechanism for retrieving intra-domain topologies. The main challenge is
to assign an AS number to a border router whose IP addresses are not
mapped to the same AS. Our algorithm is based on probabilistic and em-
pirical IP allocation rules. The goal of our pool of rules is to converge to
a consistent router to AS mapping. We show that our router-to-AS algo-
rithm results in a mapping in more than 99% of the cases. Furthermore,
with mrinfo, point-to-point links between routers can be distinguished
from multiple links attached to a switch, providing an accurate view of
the collected topologies. Finally, we provide a set of large intra-domain
topologies in various formats.
1 Introduction
The Internet topology discovery has been an extensive subject of research during
the past decade [1]. While topological information can be retrieved from passive
monitoring (using, for instance, BGP dumps in the case of AS level topology),
router level topology is usually obtained from active measurements based on
traceroute.
Nevertheless, if traceroute has been largely deployed in the last few years, it
comes with some important drawbacks. Traceroute provides a partial view of the
network as it is routing dependent. For instance, backup links (high IGP weighted
links for intra-domain and low BGP local preference links for inter-domain) are
rarely captured by traceroute. Furthermore, the alias resolution problem is a
complex issue to ﬁx [2]. This leads thus to an incomplete and biased view of the

network. Obtaining complete intra-domain topologies is further a daunting task,
requiring extensive probing campaigns [3].
Recently, we used mrinfo [4], a management multicast tool, in order to collect
topology information [5]. mrinfo has the advantage of sweeping out many of
traceroute’s limitations as it is able to silently discover all interfaces of a router.
However, it requires multicast being enable within ISPs’ networks and no ﬁltering
policies, limiting so its applicability range. Indeed, only IPv4 multicast enabled
routers reply to mrinfo. Also, some ISPs ﬁlter the IGMP messages used by
mrinfo (i.e., they do not propagate them).
In this paper, we take advantage of the mrinfo dataset [6] for extracting intra-
domain router level topologies. Obtaining real data concerning intra-domain
topologies is of the highest importance. Indeed, it allows one to study actual
network characteristics (e.g, degree distribution, network connectivity, . . . ) and
to obtain insights on the way operators build their network. Furthermore, real
topologies are crucial inputs for network simulations in order to consider complex
and realistic scenarios. By modeling the collected topologies characteristics, it
can also contribute to building better topology generators.
The contributions of this paper are twofold. We ﬁrst describe how to extract
intra-domain topologies from raw mrinfo data. While it is pretty easy to map IP
addresses to an autonomous system number (ASN), the challenge is to mark the
boundary of a given autonomous system (AS). Then, it is necessary to assign the
right ASN to an AS border router (ASBR) whose IP addresses are not mapped
to a single AS. In this paper, we provide an eﬃcient algorithm, called router-
to-AS mapping, for ﬁxing this issue. We evaluate our algorithm and show that
it provides a consistent mapping in more than 99.5% of the cases. In addition,
an interesting feature of mrinfo is that point-to-point links between routers
may be distinguished from multiple links attached to a switch. On average,
we discover that roughly 11% of the nodes, in probed networks, are actually
switches. As depicted in Sec. 3, this is a fundamental issue to correctly analyze
network characteristics. Second, based on our router-to-AS mapping, we provide
a set of intra-domain topologies under various formats. Our set of topologies is
composed of three kind of networks: Tier-1 (such as Sprint), Transit networks
(such as TDC), and Stub networks (such as UNINETT).1 An extended version
of this paper provides more results and discussions [7].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sec. 2 discusses how we
collected topology data using mrinfo; Sec. 3 explains and evaluates our router-
to-AS algorithm; Sec. 4 positions our work regarding the state of the art; Finally,
Sec. 5 concludes this paper by summarizing its main achievements and discussing
further works.
2 Collection Methodology and Dataset
mrinfo messages use the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP [8]).
IGMP was initially designed to allow hosts to report their active multicast groups

Fig. 1. mrinfo example with R2 output
to a multicast router on their LAN. Upon reception of an IGMP ASK NEIGHBORS
message, an IPv4 multicast router replies with an IGMP NEIGHBORS REPLY mes-
sage providing the list of all its local interfaces with some information about
their state. Fig. 1 shows an example of the usage of mrinfo to query the router
R2 (1.1.0.2 is the responding interface of R2). mrinfo reports that this router
is directly connected to R0 (through interface 1.1.0.1) and two ASBRs, R3
(through the interface 2.2.4.2) and R4 (through interface 2.2.1.2). We can
also notice that R2 is connected to routers R5 and R6 through a switch because
the interface 1.1.2.1 appears twice in R2’s reply. This information is obtained
by sending a single IGMP message. In practice, mrinfo provides similar infor-
mation to a show command on the router’s command line interface.
Based on mrinfo, we build a recursive probing scheme, mrinfo-rec, to scan
connected components of networks. Initially, mrinfo-rec is fed with a single
IP address corresponding to the ﬁrst router attached to the mrinfo-rec van-
tage point. mrinfo-rec probes this router and recursively applies its probing
mechanism on all the collected IP addresses. These recursive queries stop at
unresponsive routers or when all known routers have been queried. The same
process is run every day. It is worth noticing that a router not replying to an
mrinfo probe during a given day is not queried again afterwards except if it
appears again in a list of captured addresses.
To illustrate this behavior, let us apply it on the topology depicted in Fig. 1.
mrinfo-rec receives, as input, the IP address of router R0. From R0, mrinfo-rec
collects a set of neighbor IP addresses, i.e., {1.1.1.2, 1.1.0.2}. For all IP ad-
dresses in this set that were not previously probed, mrinfo-rec sends an IGMP
ASK NEIGHBORS message and, if the probed router replies, it again runs through
the set of neighbor IP addresses collected.
Since May 1st, 2004, we have been collecting the mrinfo data from a host lo-
cated in the University of Strasbourg, France. In this paper, we consider the data
collected until the end of December 2008. The entire dataset is publicly avail-
able [6]. During this period, on average, mrinfo-rec was able to daily discover
roughly 10,000 diﬀerent routers while scanning 100,000 interfaces. Note that we
remove interfaces with non-publicly routable IP addresses, i.e., the special-use
IPv4 addresses described in RFC 3330. We also remove all tunnel and disabled
interfaces. The IP-to-AS mapping is done using the last daily BGP table dump
of the given day from the Routeviews dataset. We remove from our dataset IP

addresses that cannot be mapped to an AS (0.5% on average) as well as those
that are labeled to multiple origin ASes [9] (between 2 and 3% of IP addresses
discovered each day by mrinfo-rec ). We roughly identify between 400 and 650
diﬀerent ASes every day of mrinfo-rec probing and we capture more than 850
ASes during the whole period of probing. Those ASes are distributed among
Tier-1, Transit, and Stub networks, Transit being the most represented.
3 Router-to-AS Mapping
If it is easy to determine the ASN of a core router (each IP address of such
a router is mapped to the same ASN2), the challenge is to accurately identify
a router as an ASBR and assign it the right ASN. Fig. 2 and 3 illustrate the
basics of our router-to-AS algorithm. The label attached on each link is the
result of the IP-to-AS mapping (we assume that the two IP addresses on each
directed link are necessarily mapped to the same AS). First, there are ASBRs
whose IP addresses do not all belong to the same AS. In such a case, identifying
them as ASBRs4 is straightforward but assigning them an ASN is more diﬃcult.
This situation is illustrated in Fig. 2 where router R1 has two interfaces mapped
to AS1 while the remaining two interfaces are mapped to AS2. This Shared
Addressing Space case must be solved to perform the router-to-AS mapping.
As soon as all routers are mapped to their right ASN, it is possible to extract
intra-domain topologies without falsely cutting between ASes. We denote SAS
the subset of ASBRs falling into the Shared Addressing Space case.
Second, there are ASBRs whose all IP addresses are mapped to the same
ASN. If the router-to-AS mapping is obvious, identifying them as ASBRs is a
diﬀerent ball game: their detection essentially relies on their relationships with
ASBRs belonging to SAS. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 with routers R4 and R5 as
all their interfaces are mapped to AS2. If R1 is correctly assigned to AS1, then
R4 and R5 are ASBRs mapped to the AS corresponding to the address space
of links R1↔R4 and R1↔R5. This issue is thus trivial if the SAS case has been
previously correctly solved.
At this point, it is already worth noticing (see Sec. 3.2 for further details) that
the vast majority (almost 90%) of routers are directly mapped to the right ASN
because they do not belong to the SAS set. Thus, our router-to-AS algorithm is
applied to only 10% of routers (∼ 1,000 routers on average per day).
3.1 Router-to-AS Algorithm
Our router-to-AS algorithm is based on two families of rules: probabilistic and
empirical rules. The main idea behind our algorithm is to quickly converge to a
single and consistent mapping for each router. For that purpose, our algorithm
veriﬁes the consistency of the results returned by each rule.
We start by assigning a candidate ASN to any router. This is done using our
ﬁrst probabilistic rule (called global election, or elec). It works as follows: each
