Question: While reflective code loading allows adversaries to execute payloads within the memory of a legitimate process, potentially evading file-based detection mechanisms, what is a potential drawback of this technique that a well-configured defensive system might exploit to identify malicious activity?
"A": "The inability to execute payloads in the memory of systems with robust network security measures.",
"B": "The execution of arbitrary code may still be detected by monitoring for abnormal process behavior or API usage.",
"C": "Reflective loading exclusively targets Linux platforms, making it ineffective against Windows or macOS systems.",
"D": "The technique can be easily thwarted by regularly updating the operating system and software applications."
Answer: B
