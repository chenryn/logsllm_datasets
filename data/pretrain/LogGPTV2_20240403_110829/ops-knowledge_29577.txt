After trying several Python IDEs on the Windows platform, I found that Eclipse, paired with the PyDev plugin, best meets my needs. This combination is both comfortable and user-friendly. Currently, I am working on a relatively large project and would like to use a version control system (VCS) installed on my local hard drive, as I recently moved and do not yet have internet access.

While CVS is an option, I am open to using any other VCS. It would be ideal if the VCS is not too difficult to configure with Eclipse. Could anyone suggest a possible solution or provide some hints?

Thank you in advance for any advice. Please forgive any errors in my English.

If you are open to switching to Subversion, Eclipse has a well-supported plugin called Subclipse that integrates smoothly with the IDE.
