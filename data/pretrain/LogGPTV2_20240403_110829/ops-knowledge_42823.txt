User: I am using Xcode to build a PyObjC application. The app runs fine on the build machine (running 10.8) but crashes on startup on a machine running 10.6, because it fails to find the Python 2.7 installation. Fair enough -- the preinstalled Python on 10.6 is Python 2.5. But I don't really care which Python version my app uses, I just want it to use the latest version of Python it can find.
How can I either:
A) Tell my app to use the latest version of Python available on the host system, OR
B) Bundle the entire Python source into my app?
I have been very frustrated by this issue and any help would be greatly appreciated!
Assistant: Use py2app to create the application bundle, and do that using a separate install of Python (that is don't use /System/Library/Framework/Python.framework). The python install you use should be compiled with the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET set to the minimum OSX release you want to support.
When you do this, it should be possible to deploy to older OSX releases. I regularly do this for building apps on a 10.8 machine that get deployed to a 10.5 machine. 
You do need to take some care when including other libraries, especially when those include a configure script: sometimes the configure script detects functionality that is available on the build machine, but not on the deployment machine.
BTW. You need to link against the same version of Python as you use at runtime. CPython's ABI is not compatible between feature releases (that is, the 2.6 ABI is not necessarily compatible with the 2.7 ABI).  For python 3.x there is a stable ABI that is compatible between feature releases, but AFAIK that's primarily targeting Python extensions and I don't know how useful that is for embedding Python in your application.
