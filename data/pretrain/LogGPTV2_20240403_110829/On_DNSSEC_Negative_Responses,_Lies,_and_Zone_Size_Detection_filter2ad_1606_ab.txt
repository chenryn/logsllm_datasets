### 4.3 Validation

To validate our zone size detection methodology, we conducted 1,000 trials, each consisting of 18 q-nxdomain queries, for each of the zones we created. The zones were served locally on a BIND DNS server. For each trial, the 18 queries yielded a total of 20 NSEC3 records, which included 18 NSEC3 records covering the unique names queried, as well as the NSEC3 record that covers the wildcard record and the NSEC3 record matching the zone name [23].

First, we evaluated the accuracy of our methodology using different quantile (q) values. Specifically, we tested the 1,000 trials against a zone of size 10,000 with quantile values of 20, 10, and 5. Accuracy was measured in terms of percentage error based on the actual zone size, defined as:

\[ e = \frac{z' - z}{z} \]

where \( z' \) is the estimated zone size and \( z \) is the actual zone size. Values of \( e \) closer to 0 indicate higher accuracy in zone size prediction, while \( e > 0 \) indicates an overestimation (i.e., \( z' > z \)).

The results are presented in Figure 4 as a cumulative distribution function (CDF).

**Figure 4.** Error (e) for size prediction of a DNS zone of size 10,000 for various values of q.

Weighting the NSEC3 distances, by any quartile value (Equation 4), significantly improved the accuracy compared to unweighted distance averages (Equation 3). Even the highest zone size estimates calculated using unweighted averages were lower than the actual zone size, with the median error being about 48% low. In contrast, for about 60% of the trials (between the 30th and 90th percentiles) for \( q = 10 \) and \( q = 20 \), \( z' \) was within 15% of \( z \). For about 30% of the trials (between the 50th and 80th percentiles), \( z' \) was within 7% of \( z \).

Since the errors for \( q = 10 \) and \( q = 20 \) were comparable, and \( q = 10 \) requires fewer queries to ensure at least one NSEC3 record in every quantile, we used \( q = 10 \) for the remainder of our experiments.

Next, we tested the accuracy of zone size prediction against zones of different sizes, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 5. Consistently, across all zone sizes, \( z' \) was more often underestimated, with the median values of \( e \) ranging between -6% and -16%. For zones smaller than 100,000, 75% or more of the trials had error values within 20% of the actual zone size.

| \( 10^4 \) | -0.06        | 0.70                                               |

### 5. DNS Zone Size Measurement Study

To perform our DNS zone size measurement on deployed DNS zones, we analyzed 2,182,987 DNSSEC-signed zones to determine the strategy they employ for negative responses. This allowed us to identify candidate DNS zones. The list of zones consisted of DNSSEC-signed second-level domains extracted from the zone files for 821 top-level domains (TLDs). The TLD zone files were obtained from the following sources: Verisignâ€™s Zone File Access [6], the Centralized Zone Data Service (CZDS) [2], the Public Interest Registry (PIR) [5], the Internet Foundation in Sweden (IIS) [4], and Domains Index [3], from which we acquired domains under .gov. DNSSEC-signed domains were identified as those with at least one delegation signer (DS) record in the TLD zone file. The breakdown of the domains and their TLDs is shown in Table 3. Nearly 80% of the zones analyzed were under the .com and .se TLDs, due to the significant presence of DS records in those domains.

### 5.1 Zone Analysis

For each zone in our dataset, we identified the authoritative servers using DNS lookups for the NS (name server) records and the corresponding A and AAAA (IPv4 and IPv6 address) records. With the set of IP addresses for the authoritative servers, we issued three queries to each server: a q-nxdomain query, a q-nodata query, and a q-nodata-type query. These queries were intended to elicit different types of negative response behavior, including:

- **NXDOMAIN:** A response indicating that the queried name does not exist.
- **Wildcard:** A response synthesized from a wildcard, with NSEC or NSEC3 records to indicate that the queried name did not exist (as specified by DNSSEC [23]).
- **NODATA:** A response indicating that the name exists but has no records corresponding to the queried type [7].

The expected response for q-nxdomain was either an NXDOMAIN or wildcard response, and the expected response for q-nodata and q-nodata-type was NODATA. Under DNSSEC requirements, all such responses would include NSEC or NSEC3 records. Table 3 shows the breakdown of response strategies observed by authoritative servers: traditional NSEC, traditional NSEC3, white lies with NSEC3, and black lies with NSEC. If at least one of the query responses matched a given negative response strategy, the zone was included in the count for that strategy.

We note that for a very small (less than 1%) percentage of the zones analyzed, we observed several different negative response behaviors, such that they are represented in multiple categories. For example, some zones used white lies in response to our q-nxdomain, but returned NSEC records in response to the q-nodata-type. Additionally, for 3% of the DNS zones we analyzed, none of our queries resulted in NSEC or NSEC3 records, so their negative response strategy remained unclassified.

The responses for the unclassified zones fell into several categories. Some q-nxdomain queries yielded non-wildcard positive responses (i.e., indicating that the record existed), resulting from server-side record synthesis with online-signing. This method is employed by organizations to avoid disclosing the fact that the response is a wildcard. Some responses lacked NSEC or NSEC3 records due to misconfiguration, such as the presence of a DS record without actual DNSSEC signing, or a response with the SERVFAIL code.

We observed that nearly one-third of the zones employed white lies, while just over half used traditional NSEC3. About 11% of zones were signed with traditional NSEC, and about 2% used black lies. The combined presence of white lies and black lies implied that at least 32% of the zones we analyzed employed online signing.

### 5.2 Detecting Zone Size in the Wild

We tested our zone detection methodology in the wild by issuing 20 queries to each of the zones in our dataset that were signed with plain NSEC3, i.e., without white lies. The results of this measurement are shown in Figure 6. We found that 85% of the zones we probed were so small that even with only 20 queries, we received fewer than 10 unique NSEC3 records, which is the minimum size of \( N \) necessary to apply our methodology. The repeated return of NSEC3 records in these zones indicated that the zones were small and likely being completely enumerated with our small number of queries. Thus, for \( |N| < 10 \), we simply used \( z' = |N| \) as our zone size estimate. For the zones we measured, 99% were smaller than 40, but the top 1% reached up to nearly four million.

**Figure 6.** Estimated zone sizes (\( z' \)) for the NSEC3-signed zones in our data set (Table 3).

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a methodology for learning the size of a DNS zone by issuing relatively few DNS queries. We demonstrated the accuracy of our technique in a lab environment and showed that in approximately 75% of cases, the methodology yielded an estimate within 20% of the actual zone size with only 18 queries. We deployed this methodology on over one million NSEC3 zones in our dataset and learned that most of these zones are small, with 85% having fewer than 10 domain names.

As part of our study, we measured some of the DNSSEC negative response behaviors currently deployed. We found that the most popular negative response strategy in our dataset is traditional NSEC3, used by 53% of zones, making them candidates for DNS zone size estimation using our methodology. Privacy-preserving strategies such as NSEC3 with white lies and NSEC with black lies are also gaining traction, with 30% and 2% deployment, respectively.

The techniques presented in this paper serve as a general-purpose tool to better understand the DNS ecosystem, particularly in terms of the size of deployed DNS zones, specifically those signed with NSEC3. It also provides new insights into information disclosure, regardless of how innocuous the revealing of the size of a DNS zone might be to an organization. This knowledge can benefit and empower the designers, maintainers, and users of the Internet.
