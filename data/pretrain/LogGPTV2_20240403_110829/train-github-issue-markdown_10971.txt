 **Apache Airflow version** :  
2.0.0b3
**What happened** :  
When Airflow is ran within CeleryExecutor mode and using the new Cloudwatch
integration (from #7437), log groups and log streams are created, but no log
events are pushed to AWS. The Webserver is able to read the log stream as
expected. There are no errors, just empty logs within Cloudwatch:  
`*** Reading remote log from Cloudwatch log_group: airflow-task log_stream:
tutorial_taskflow_api_etl_dag/extract/2020-12-02T16_37_07.011589+00_00/1.log.`
By switching to SequentialExecutor (default), with one container acting as
both the scheduler and webserver, only then are the logs written as expected:
    *** Reading remote log from Cloudwatch log_group: airflow-task log_stream: tutorial_taskflow_api_etl_dag/extract/2020-12-02T18_04_50.259906+00_00/1.log.

The logging configuration is turned on for the Scheduler, Webserver, and
Workers. **Log groups and log streams are being created as expected, but log
events are not**. There are no errors in the workers, and in AWS the IAM
policy permissions are all-inclusive (they also definitely work with
SequentialExecutor)
**What you expected to happen** :  
I expected logs of tasks ran by the celery workers to display for the
Webserver when ran with Cloudwatch Remote logging.
**How to reproduce it** :  
Run Airflow 2.0.0b3 with Webserver in CeleryExecutor mode, two workers, 1
scheduler
