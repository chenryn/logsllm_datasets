### Apache Airflow Version
2.0.0b3

### Issue Description
When running Airflow in `CeleryExecutor` mode with the new CloudWatch integration (introduced in PR #7437), log groups and log streams are created, but no log events are pushed to AWS. The Webserver can read the log stream, but the logs within CloudWatch are empty. 

#### Observed Behavior
- Log groups and log streams are created.
- No log events are pushed to AWS.
- The Webserver can read the log stream, but the logs are empty.
- Example log entry:
  ```
  *** Reading remote log from Cloudwatch log_group: airflow-task log_stream: tutorial_taskflow_api_etl_dag/extract/2020-12-02T16_37_07.011589+00_00/1.log.
  ```

#### Expected Behavior
- Log events should be pushed to AWS CloudWatch.
- The Webserver should be able to display the logs of tasks run by the Celery workers.

### Reproduction Steps
1. Run Airflow 2.0.0b3 with the Webserver in `CeleryExecutor` mode.
2. Configure two workers and one scheduler.
3. Enable the CloudWatch integration for remote logging.
4. Observe that log groups and log streams are created but remain empty.

### Additional Information
- Logging configuration is enabled for the Scheduler, Webserver, and Workers.
- When switching to `SequentialExecutor` (default) with one container acting as both the scheduler and webserver, the logs are written as expected.
- Example of a working log entry with `SequentialExecutor`:
  ```
  *** Reading remote log from Cloudwatch log_group: airflow-task log_stream: tutorial_taskflow_api_etl_dag/extract/2020-12-02T18_04_50.259906+00_00/1.log.

- There are no errors in the workers.
- IAM policy permissions are all-inclusive and have been verified to work with `SequentialExecutor`.

### Conclusion
The issue appears to be specific to the `CeleryExecutor` mode, as logs are not being pushed to CloudWatch. Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause and resolve the issue.
