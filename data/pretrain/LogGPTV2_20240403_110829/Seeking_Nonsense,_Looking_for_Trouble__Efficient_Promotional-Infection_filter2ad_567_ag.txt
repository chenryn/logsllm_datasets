#### Promotional Infections and Search Engine Indexing
Promotional pages should be made visible to search engines rather than hidden from them. Issues related to search results include delays caused by page indexing and the expiration of indexed pages. Although our approach is not designed to intercept promotional infections before they are indexed, the impact of such infections is limited at that stage because their primary purpose is to advertise malicious content, which is ineffective if the infected pages are not discovered by search engines.

For page expiration, it is crucial to consider that as long as the URLs of the promoted content remain active, the attack remains effective. The very goal of the attack is to ensure that people can find these URLs, which can be verified by crawling the links. Additionally, even for expired pages, the snippets in search results can still be used to identify new keywords.

#### Evasion Techniques
Adversaries may employ various evasion tactics, such as adding more relevant keywords to the infected page to make the content appear consistent with the website's theme or hiding inconsistent content within images. However, even with relevant content, the presence of frequent malicious keywords can cause a noticeable semantic deviation from the original website's theme. This deviation is detectable by search engines and can affect the ranking of the malicious content. Hiding content in images leads to the neglect of malicious content in search results, which is counterproductive for the adversary. Fundamentally, any attempt to conceal the advertised content will undermine the effectiveness of the promotional effort.

Another evasion strategy is to compromise websites with compatible semantics. This approach significantly limits the number of potential targets, especially for sponsored top-level domains (sTLDs). For example, even selling medicine on a health institution's site can be detected, as demonstrated by the NIH page infections discussed earlier in this paper.

#### Limitations
Our current design focuses on detecting infections in sTLD sites due to their well-defined semantic meanings and their vulnerability to adversaries. Meanwhile, generic top-level domains (gTLDs) are also frequently compromised for promotional purposes. A natural next step is to develop semantic technologies to protect these domains. Our preliminary study (Section V-B) shows that this is feasible by leveraging Alexa categories to identify and compare the semantics of more generic domains with the content they host.

Furthermore, our semantic-based detection technique does not differentiate between server-injected domains, blog/forum spam, and URL redirection. In our research, we randomly sampled 100 detected pages and found that approximately 20% were spam, which is also considered illicit advertising. Future work includes developing automatic technologies to identify these cases, allowing for different responses, such as input sanitization. For instance, comment pages can often be detected by keywords like "comment" or "redirect" in their links. If such a page is found to promote malicious content, further analysis can determine whether it is link spam or an infection.

The use of search engines also has performance implications. Search service providers often impose limits on crawling frequency, causing delays in detecting malicious content and affecting the scalability of our technique. However, given the effectiveness of SEISE in catching promotional infections, we believe collaboration with search providers to detect Internet-wide infections is possible.

#### Lessons Learned
Our study reveals that sTLD sites, particularly those of universities and research institutions, are often under-protected. These organizations tend to have open and loosely controlled IT infrastructures. For example, in a university, individual servers are often protected at the department level, while university-level IT typically handles network-level protection. The problem is that hosts are often managed by less experienced personnel and may run outdated, vulnerable software. Given the nature of promotional infections, they are less conspicuous in network traffic compared to other intrusions, such as setting up a botnet. We believe that SEISE, particularly its Context Analyzer, can help web administrators detect issues with these less-protected hosts. A more fundamental solution would be better centralized control, at least in terms of identifying security risks at the host level and ensuring that administrators keep their software up-to-date.

#### Responsible Disclosure
Since discovering infected domains, we have been in active communication with affected parties. We have reported over 120 fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) to the US CERT and 136 FQDNs to CCERT (responsible for .edu.cn) in China, the two countries hosting most infected domains. CCERT has confirmed our reports and notified all related organizations, with 27 responding and fixing their problems. Directly contacting victims to obtain more details, such as log access, from the infected servers is challenging. Given the scale of the attacks, the entire reporting process will take time.

#### Related Work
Detection of malicious content injection has been studied extensively. Techniques have been developed to analyze web content, redirection chains, and URL patterns. Examples include DOM-based clustering systems for monitoring scam websites [19] and Delta [16], which tracks content and structure modifications across different versions of a website to identify infections using signatures. More recently, Soska et al. [29] proposed a system to predict future compromises by analyzing features from web traffic, file systems, and page content. Borgolte et al. [17] introduced Meerkat, a computer vision approach to detect defacement. Other studies focus on malicious redirectors and attack infrastructures, such as JsRED [24] and Shady Path [31].

Compared to these techniques, our approach automatically analyzes the semantics of web content and looks for inconsistencies with the hosting website's theme. We believe that a semantics-based approach is the most effective solution for promotional infections, as it can easily detect such infections by checking the semantics of the sites, whereas syntactic elements alone are insufficient. Our study shows that leveraging search results is sufficient and more efficient than content and infrastructure-based approaches.

Similar to our work, Evilseed [21] uses search results for malicious website detection but only searches URL patterns and does not analyze the semantics of the results. Our study indicates that focusing solely on syntactic features like URL patterns is insufficient for accurate detection, as Evilseed reports a high false detection rate (above 90%). In contrast, SEISE inspects all search result snippets, automatically discovering and analyzing their semantics, achieving a low false detection rate (1.5%) with over 90% coverage.

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we report on promotional infections, which create a significant semantic gap between the infected sTLD and the illicit promotional content. Exploiting this gap, our semantic-based approach, SEISE, uses NLP techniques to automatically choose initial behavior triggers (IBTs) and analyze search result pages to find truly compromised sites. Our study shows that SEISE achieves a low false detection rate (about 1.5%) with over 90% coverage. It can also automatically expand its IBT list to include new terms and categories. Running on 100,000 FQDNs, SEISE detected 11,000 infected FQDNs, highlighting the significant impact of promotional infections. Among the infected domains are leading educational institutions, government agencies, and military domains, with 3% of .edu and .gov, and over one thousand .gov.cn domains falling victim to illicit advertising campaigns. Our research underscores the importance of sTLDs to adversaries and the heightened bar our technique sets for such attacks.

Moving forward, there is great potential to extend SEISE for protecting gTLDs, as indicated by our preliminary study. We are also exploring the possibility of providing a public service for detecting such infections.
