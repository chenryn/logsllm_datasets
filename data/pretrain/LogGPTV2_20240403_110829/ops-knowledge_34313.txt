User: Please describe the principle and process of HTTPS transmission encryption
Assistant: HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure and encrypted network transmission protocol for data transmission on the Internet. HTTPS implements encryption by using the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol. The following is the principle and process of HTTPS transmission encryption: Principle: HTTPS uses public key encryption and private key decryption to encrypt transmitted data. When a connection is established between a client and a server, the server sends its own public key to the client. The client encrypts the data with the public key and sends it to the server, and the server decrypts the data with the private key. This way, even if intercepted, the data cannot be decrypted. Process: 1. The client initiates a connection request to the server. 2. The server sends the public key to the client. 3. After receiving the public key, the client generates a random symmetric key, encrypts it with the public key, and sends it to the server. 4. The server uses the private key to decrypt the data sent by the client to obtain the symmetric key. 5. The client and server encrypt the communication using a symmetric key. In this way, all information in the communication process is encrypted. 6. After the data transmission is completed, the session ends, and the client and server will discard the symmetric key. 7. If the client initiates a request to the server again, the connection will be re-established and the encrypted communication will be carried out according to the above process.
