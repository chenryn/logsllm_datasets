User: Suppose you are maintaining a large Internet application that handles tens of thousands of requests per day. Suddenly, you find that the overall performance of the application is degraded, causing a large number of failed requests. Please provide a set of methods and tools for troubleshooting performance problems step by step.
Assistant: 1. Monitor system load Use system resource monitoring tools (such as top, htop, iostat, etc.) to monitor the CPU, memory, disk IO and other load conditions of the system to see if there is a resource bottleneck. 2. Monitor network traffic Use network traffic monitoring tools (such as iftop, nethogs, etc.) to monitor network traffic and check whether there is a network bottleneck. 3. Log analysis Analyze application logs to find out abnormal or error logs, and check whether there are suspicious requests or operations. 4. Database performance analysis Use database performance monitoring tools (such as pt-query-digest) to analyze the slow query logs of the database, find out which queries are slow, and optimize them. 5. Code analysis Use code analysis tools (such as xdebug, Blackfire) to analyze the performance bottleneck of the application, find out which code is slow, and optimize it. 6. High concurrent stress testing Use stress testing tools (such as ab, JMeter, LoadRunner) to conduct high concurrent stress testing on the system, check the system load and response time, and find out the performance bottleneck of the system. 7. Cache optimization Consider using caching technologies (such as Redis, Memcached) to reduce the pressure on the database, cache common data and query results, and improve system performance. 8. Load balancing Consider using load balancing technology (such as Nginx, LVS, etc.) to share the load of the system, evenly distribute requests to multiple servers, and improve the availability and performance of the system. 9. Horizontal expansion Consider using horizontal expansion technology (such as distributed system architecture, stateless architecture, micro-service architecture, etc.) to split the system into multiple modules, reduce the coupling degree of the system, and improve the scalability and performance of the system.
