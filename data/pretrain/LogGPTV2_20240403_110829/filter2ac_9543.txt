**ATT&CK ID:** M1030  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Segmentation

Network segmentation is a security practice that involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments. This technique can be used to restrict access to specific infrastructure components that do not require broad network connectivity. By implementing network segmentation, organizations can significantly reduce the potential impact of an Attack-in-the-Middle (AiTM) by limiting the attacker's ability to move laterally within the network. This not only mitigates the risk but also helps to contain and alleviate the scope of any malicious activity.
