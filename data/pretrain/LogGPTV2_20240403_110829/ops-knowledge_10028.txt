User: Can I use AppEngines "Push to Deploy" (deploying by pushing a GIT repository) to update a multiple module Python application?
Where do I get the repo url for the non default modules?
Assistant: Lack of support for App Engine modules is a known issue for the push-to-deploy feature, and is something we're actively working on addressing at this time.
