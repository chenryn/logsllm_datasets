User: Is it possible to  execute python commands passed as strings using python -c? can someone give an example.
Assistant: You can use -c to get Python to execute a string. For example:
python3 -c "print(5)"
However, there doesn't seem to be a way to use escape characters (e.g. \n). So, if you need them, use a pipe from echo -e or printf instead. For example:
$ printf "import sys\nprint(sys.path)" | python3
