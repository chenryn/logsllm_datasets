Aaron Bayles 
DC101 @ DEF CON 22 
 19 years in IT/Infosec 
 Worked in Oil & Gas (O&G) last 8 years 
 Along the way 
 Penetration testing 
 Vulnerability assessment 
 Network architecture, design & 
implementation 
 Risk assessment 
 Legacy equipment/comms 
 Remote (geographic) connectivity 
 Long lifecycle 
 Power/space is a premium 
 Life safety can be dependent 
The demands placed on Industrial 
Control Systems (ICS) & SCADA 
networks don’t match up with 
security requirements 
 Understand your network & data flows 
 Does not require expert knowledge 
 Start with the basics 
 Some concepts for enterprise IT can 
be used, with modification 
 Build relationships between enterprise 
IT and industrial IT 
 Network segmentation 
 Portable media control 
 Configuration management 
 Disaster recovery (DR) planning 
 Workforce development/training 
Although these may be similar, 
significant differences exist 
 Formally the Purdue Enterprise 
Reference Architecture (PERA) 
 Widely accepted within ICS industry 
 Compatible with multiple standards, 
ISA95, ISA99, and IEC 62443 
 Works with zone & conduit concepts 
 Represented by Layers 0/1-5 
 Starting point for ICS network 
segregation 
 Traffic within same zone is allowed 
 Traffic passing between zones via 
conduits are controlled 
 Layer 2 (L2) can SET/CHANGE values 
on L1 
 L3 can only READ values from L2 & L1 
 Control points also allow for reporting 
 ICS applications often misbehave 
 OPC (Object Linking and Embedding for Process 
Control) uses MS DCOM 
 They don’t always communicate statefully 
 Protocols have been subverted 
 MODBUS 
 DNP3 
 Some vendors have started to adapt to ICS 
 Tofino (C1D2, DIN rail mount) 
 Palo Alto (Rack mount only for now) 
 Do not install in blocking mode without 
extensive testing & tuning 
 USB & removable media control 
 Anti-virus/anti-malware 
 Application whitelisting 
 Patch management for EWS & servers 
 Corporate IT has these systems, BUT 
 ICS cannot patch as frequently 
 Application & OS security models differ 
 Dependent on directory services (AD) 
 Build your own! 
 Like enterprise IT, ICS requires remote 
support and maintenance 
 There have been breaches from this 
 Telvent 
 Target 
 Vendors often will not recommend a 
security architecture 
 Build your own! 
 Incident response requires DATA 
 Centralized logging 
 Traffic analysis 
 Logstash, elasticsearch, and cacti  
 Restoring PLC programming or device 
configs can be difficult 
 Specialized ICS Configuration 
Management software exists 
 MDT AutoSave 
 Siemens TeamCenter 
 Specific ICS security trainings & 
certifications are uncommon 
 SANS/GIAC 
 Idaho National Laboratory (INL) 
 3rd Party Training 
 Offered by consulting/services companies 
 Blends Infosec with ICS sensitivities 
 Targeted for existing IT skillsets 
 For some, DR is simply considered as 
having equipment spares on site 
 Ability to rapidly restore services may 
not be planned 
 Business impact analysis is key 
 Updated lists of vital assets and 
personnel must be maintained
