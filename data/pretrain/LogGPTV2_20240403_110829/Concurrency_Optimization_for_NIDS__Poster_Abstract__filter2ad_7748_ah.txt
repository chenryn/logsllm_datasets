pathways Metabolic network analysis allowed the characterization of key metabolic ‘hubs’ that define the observed metabolic reprogramming These 
changes were found to be related to enhanced drought resistance traits Thus, our results suggest that selected PGPRs act as priming agents, enhancing 
plant resistance to abiotic stresses Furthermore, the study contributes to ongoing efforts towards a comprehensive understanding of the PGPR-related 
defence priming phenomenon, which could play a significant role in alleviation of drought stress in plants, providing sustainable and economically 
favorable solutions to improve agricultural practices and crop productivity

A strategy for the discovery and characterisation of health and decline biomarkers in British Oak trees  
using non-targeted metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jasen Finch, Aberystwyth University, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Manfred Beckmann, Sandra Denman, John Draper
Decline syndromes in British Oak trees are becoming increasingly important across the UK with the onset of climate change These syndromes exhibit 
a multitude of complex disease phenotypes to which biotic and predisposing abiotic factors can contribute to over many growing seasons A minimally 
destructive strategy for reproducibly sampling the metabolome content of living cell types in woody tissues has been developed that has allowed samples 
to be collected from trees at a number of sites across the UK Trees have been extensively phenotyped for attributes reflecting aspects of decline status 
including; canopy condition, tree size and presence of biotic agents Consideration of all of these phenotypic data has led to the development of a novel 
“tree health index”, which describes the trees over a continuous decline spectrum Sampled woody tissues have been analysed using untargeted flow 
infusion electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry (FIE-HRMS), normal and reverse phase liquid chromatography high-resolution mass 
spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to provide comprehensive metabolome coverage Using the machine 
learning algorithm random forest, metabolome features have been integrated with the tree health indexes revealing strong associations with a number of 
explanatory metabolites including amino acids involved in nitrogen metabolism/transport These markers have been shown to be robust over 2 growing 
seasons and can adequately predict decline status in an independent set of trees Identified markers have the potential to provide future diagnostic tools to 
monitor health status and even as a predictive tool for long term management strategies for oak decline

Linking the volatilome and metabolome via plant defenses: stimulation of the salicylic acid pathway recruits 
natural enemies below ground
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Camila Filgueiras, Cornell University, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Denis S Willett
The metabolome and volitalome can be considered linked, overlapping sets Traditionally, studies have looked at each in isolation with the implicit 
understanding that one influences the other In plant-insect interactions this understanding is becoming more than implicit Here we show that exogenous 
aboveground stimulation of the salicylic acid pathway induces release of volatiles by plant roots that recruit entomopathogenic nematode natural enemies 
belowground This is one of the first examples of aboveground effects propagating belowground and points to a role of the salicylic acid pathway in 
mediating secondary plant defenses reliant upon volatile recruitment of natural enemies Understanding the relationship between internal plant defense 
metabolites and volatiles released by plants that recruit natural enemies enhances not only our knowledge of the connection between metabolome and 
volitalome, but also our ability to control pests in the field

Is Metabolomics ready for the return of Artificial Neural Networks?
PRESENTING AUTHOR: David Broadhurst, Edith Cowan University, Australia
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were first applied to metabolomics data in the late 1990’s as part of a research programme spearheaded by Kell and 
Goodacre at Aberystwyth University It was from this nexus that my PhD was published in 1998 titled ‘Genetic Algorithms, Artificial Neural Networks and 
their Application to Chemometrics’ Even though the methodology proved effective for modelling metabolomics data, ANNs were generally perceived 
as a ‘black box’, and considered too difficult to interpret By the early 2000’s the popularity of ANNs had dwindled to zero, with a more transparent linear 
machine learning method, partial least squares regression, rapidly becoming the dominant mode of interrogating multivariate metabolite data Over the last 
~5 years there has been a resurgence in the use of ANNs in many areas of systems biology under the guise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning 
Most of the successful applications have been in image analysis, but there is increasing interest in applying these methods to biomarker discovery in 
systems biology In this presentation I will map out the current and future challenges in applying ANNs to metabolomics, given the changing landscape of 
acceptance and increased computational resources It is clear that for any AI techniques to be adopted without cynicism, all code and applications must 
be open transparent and detailed scrutiny As such, I will introduce the use of experiential learning through open-source Jupyter Notebooks, operating via 
cloud computing resources such as Binder and Microsoft Azure

MS-DIAL 4.0: a computational workflow for ion mobility tandem mass spectrometry data in metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hiroshi Tsugawa, RIKEN, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Yoshifumi Mori, Yasuhiro Higashi, Aya Satoh, Sven Meyer, Kazuki Saito, Masanori Arita
Ion mobility mass spectrometry provides the robust physiochemical measurement (or property) called collision cross section (CCS) of metabolites by 
increasing the peak capacities in mobility dimension Although metabolite identification can be substantially improved in terms of accuracy and coverage, 
few programs can handle its raw data for peak picking, metabolite annotation, peak alignment, and statistical analysis Here, we release a new software 
program, MS-DIAL 40, for data dependent MS/MS acquisition in liquid chromatography coupled with ion mobility tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/
MS) The program facilitates the metabolite annotation by integrating five-dimensional (5D) physicochemical properties, ie, ion abundance, retention time 
(RT), CCS, m/z, and MS/MS spectrum In addition, we developed the enriched mass spectral database for lipidomics containing the 5D properties for more 
than 200,000 molecules of 90 lipid classes We showcase our workflow for plant lipidomics where the metabolic changes in heat stress are grasped by the 
5D diagnostic criteria

Chemically informed distance metrics for tandem mass spectrometry data
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Madeleine Ernst, Department of Congenital Disorders, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Justin J.J. van der Hooft, Kyo Bin Kang, Asker Brejnrod, Louis-Félix Nothias, Ricardo R. da Silva, Pieter C. Dorrestein
Untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has become a method of choice to evaluate differences and similarities in metabolite profiles in a 
multitude of applications and sample types Pairwise dissimilarities across samples are often summarized using a distance metric followed by multivariate 
statistics such as principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) for comparative analyses However, conventional distance metrics ignore the chemical structural 
relatedness between molecules Thus, whilst two samples could contain chemically similar yet distinct molecules, they would be regarded as very 
different Here, we propose two chemically informed distance metrics inspired by the UniFrac metric, a metric used to compare microbial communities 
by incorporating phylogenetic relatedness between observed organisms Similar to microbes, molecules are also related to each other as they share 
biosynthetic pathways and consequently similar chemical substructures We implement two versions of calculating chemical relatedness, one based on 
shared chemical class annotations, and one based on shared substructure patterns Using datasets from diverse sources, we show how these metrics 
can improve multivariate statistics and subsequent data interpretation For example, in the cosmopolitan plant family Rhamnaceae we observe high 
chemical dissimilarity across two phylogenetic clades producing chemically very distantly related compounds, such as flavonoids and terpenoids, a trend 
that could not be revealed using conventional methods We expect that the proposed chemically-informed distance metrics will be of great benefit to any 
metabolomics fields studying complex mixtures

Identifying biologically relevant modules in metabolomics and lipidomics data with Differential Network-based 
Enrichment Analysis (DNEA)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alla Karnovsky, University of Michigan, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Gayatri Iyer, Janis Wigginton, William Duren, Marci Brandenburg, George Michailidis
Metabolomics and lipidomics datasets are becoming increasingly large and complex, requiring powerful statistical and bioinformatics tools A well-
established approach to linking alterations in metabolite levels to specific biological processes is to map experimentally measured metabolites to known 
biochemical pathways and to identify the pathways that are significantly enriched with those However, traditional enrichment analysis techniques 
have limited utility for the analysis of untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics data We developed an alternative approach, which relies on extracting 
meaningful associations between metabolites/lipids directly from the experimental data Our Differential Network Enrichment Analysis method (DNEA) 
uses joint structural sparsity estimation to build partial correlation networks from the data, performs consensus clustering to identify highly connected 
subnetworks, and uses Network-based Gene Set Analysis (NetGSA) to identify the differentially enriched subnetworks We have extended the method, 
improving its versatility in situations such as unbalanced designs and low sample size relative to number of features The program is implemented in Java 
as a client-server application with a GUI The input to the program is a comma-separated file with metabolite measurements and the information about 
experimental groups The output contains the list of enriched subnetworks ranked by significance and can be viewed as an HTML file, or exported into a 
network visualization software (eg Cytoscape) We tested DNEA in a number of publically available metabolomics and lipidomics datasets from a variety 
of diseases and will demonstrate that DNEA can identify alterations in both network structure and expression levels of interacting biomolecules that impact 
disease phenotypes

Signature Mapping (SigMa): A new automatic tool for rapid processing of complex urine NMR spectra
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Bekzod Khakimov, University of Copenhagen, Denmark
CO-AUTHORS: Bekzod Khakimov*, Nabiollah Mobaraki, Alessia Trimigno, Violetta Aru, Søren Balling Engelsen
1D 1H NMR analysis of urine generates rich but complex data Retrieving metabolite information from complex NMR spectra is a main bottleneck due to 
signal overlapping and chemical shift changes This study illustrates a new method; Signature Mapping (SigMa), for identification and quantification of 
signature signals (SS) and allows rapid conversion of complex human urine NMR spectra into an informative metabolite table SigMa compiles advanced 
multivariate data analysis algorithms for NMR data alignment, baseline correction, peak finding and peak deconvolution into user friendly software The 
method utilizes an experimental data on unique chemical shift ranges of 166 SS representing 100 urine metabolites, enabling unambiguous metabolite 
identification in thousands of spectra simultaneously In addition, an automatic peak finding option of SigMa allows detection of spectral regions (SR) of 
any unknown spin systems, and complex regions representing overlapped signals of several metabolites This makes SigMa suitable for targeted and 
untargeted metabolomics SigMa applies an individual MCR modelling for relative quantification of each SS, while complex SR are quantified using a 
binning approach The performance of SigMa was evaluated using three NMR datasets and proved to be more efficient than the most often used binning 
approach Processing of 40 spectra measured on urine of seven healthy individuals using SigMa showed an increase of the between individual variation 
while decreasing the within individual variation SigMa also depicted the highest quantification accuracy and reproducibility of urine metabolites in large 
datasets containing several thousands of human urine NMR spectra

Spatial metabolomics in tissues and single cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Theodore Alexandrov, EMBL, Germany
Metabolites, lipids, and other small molecules exhibit complex and cell-specific spatial localization in tissues supporting tissue homeostasis in health and 
metabolism reprogramming in disease Our team develops novel tools for spatial metabolomics to detect and interpret the roles of these molecules in 
tissues and single cells I will present a recently developed cloud platform METASPACE for spatial metabolomics in tissues which provides a comprehensive 
community-populated resource for metabolism research and for spatial systems biology I will also present a spatial single-cell metabolomics method 
which, by correlative in situ imaging of cell monolayers, provides for each cell its metabolic profile and assesses its optical, morphological, and fluorescent 
phenotype These tools open novel avenues for understanding metabolism in tissues and on the single-cell level

Comprehensive Single Cell Multi Omics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Christian Berchtold, Institute for Chemistry and Bioanalytics, Switzerland
CO-AUTHORS: Luca Rima, Stefan Arnold, Götz Schlotterbeck, Thomas Braun
The comprehensive combination of various analytical methods is a key feature for the future of biochemical investigations Analyzing metabolites 
and proteins from the same sample, especially from the same cell, might be extremely supportive of gaining a fundamental understanding of cellular 
processes A recently developed single-cell picker [1, 2] allows the sampling and lysis of individual cells This enables the picking of cells according to 
phenotypical appearance In this proof of concept study, we used this system to deposit the lysate from one or a few cells on dedicated slides Using 
a modified CAMAG TLC-MS interface, the cell lysate was transferred into a standard LC-MS system including chromatographic separation Highly 
abundant metabolites such as glutamine or glutamic acid were detected to a level of single cells Proteins remained on the microscope slide and were 
detected by antibody staining after LC-MS analysis of the same cell Finally, we could demonstrate a strategy to combine several techniques to detect 
metabolites and proteins from the same sample However, the concept needs further optimization according to sensitivity, robustness, and speed for 
quantitative high-throughput measurements

Quantifying heterogeneity in drug uptake, metabolism and effect using Raman spectroscopy and mass 
spectrometry on the single-cell level
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ahmed Ali, Leiden University, The Netherlands | RIKEN, Japan, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Yasmine Abouleila, Arno Germond, Mashaghi Tabari A, Thomas Hankemeier, Toshio Yanagida
In the drug discovery field, monitoring drug uptake, its metabolism and response on the single-cell level has been extremely challenging In this study, we 
show the potential of label-free single-cell analysis in drug discovery by utilizing a bi-modal analytical platform that combines Raman spectroscopy and 
mass spectrometry (MS) Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the effect of tamoxifen on single-cells treated with the drug in a high-throughput and 
non-invasive manner The same cells were then sampled and analyzed by mass spectrometry, in which, the concentration of the drug and its metabolite 
4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT) were measured in each cell MS measurements revealed a strong heterogeneity in the drug concentration across single-cells 
This phenomenon was even more pronounced in the case of its metabolite Despite this, the concentrations of both the drug and its metabolite correlated 
positively, confirming the drug uptake and drug metabolism in the cell Moreover, Raman could not only detect the cellular metabolic changes caused by 
the drug, but also predict whether a given cell is affected by the drug or not with 97% accuracy using a PLS-DA model Finally, we succeeded in correlating 
the drug effect (measured by Raman spectroscopy) and the concentration of the drug or its metabolite (measured by MS) on the single-cell level The 
Raman peaks used in this correlation could be used as biomarkers for the drug activity in the cell In conclusion, our integrated Raman-MS platform proved 
to be a powerful tool that could aid future drug discovery efforts

Relationships between cellular metabolite and drug uptake and transporter expression profiles
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Marina Muelas, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Farah Mughal, Steve O’Hagan, Philip J. Day, Douglas B. Kell
It is widely but erroneously believed that drugs get into cells by passing through the phospholipid bilayer portion of the plasma and other membranes 
Much evidence shows, however, that this is not the case, and drugs cross biomembranes by hitchhiking on transporters for other natural molecules 
to which these drugs are structurally similar We present untargeted metabolomics time course analyses of the uptake and secretion of metabolites in 
human serum by a number of human cell lines We show how distinct the metabolic footprints of different cell lines are from one another We subsequently 
compare the transcriptomes (by RT-qPCR or using published RNA-Seq datasets) and published proteomic expression profiles of cell lines with the uptake of 
substances (by LC-MS/MS) By employing mathematical methods we infer the variations in SLC and ABC membrane transporter expression to best explain 
the variation in metabolite uptake and the relationship to the function of the tissues from which these cell lines are derived This analyses will also admit the 
production of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models that will further aid in the prediction (and testing) of transporters responsible for 
the uptake and secretion a number of pharmaceutical drugs We also utilise the Gini index (coefficient) as a novel means of characterising the variation in 
individual transporter distributions between these cell lines Our results show that many transporters exhibit extremely high Gini coefficients, indicating a 
much higher degree of specialisation than is usually assumed

Many legumes, like soybean, do not depend on synthetic fertilizers for nitrogen uptake Instead, they create mutualistic relationships with bacteria 
capable of biological nitrogen fixation Specialized plant organs are created from these interactions (ie, root nodules), were bacteria infected plant cells 
are intimately mixed with uninfected cells Exploring the metabolic profiles for these heterogeneous systems requires single-cell analysis techniques 
Here, we present the combination of fiber-based laser ablation electrospray ionization (f-LAESI), with 21 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance 
mass spectrometry (21T FTICR-MS) for the direct analysis of single cells Direct determination of metabolite formulas from isotopic fine structures (IFS) 
was attained from our single cell data Over 100 compounds were tentatively assigned based on ultra-high mass accuracy, and elemental formulas for 47 
of these were verified by IFS Comparing the calculated IFS patterns for possible metabolite ions with the experimental data enabled the identification of 
close-to-isobaric compounds with different elemental compositions Infected cells showed higher abundances for nitrogen-containing compounds and 
lipids compared to uninfected cells Compositional heterogeneity among infected cells was observed by determining the metabolic noise (η²) Within a 
population of 124 infected cells, several primary metabolites essential for cellular growth and maintenance, and plant-specific secondary metabolites, 
exhibited relatively low η² (≤ 050) Conversely, lipids associated with plant and bacteroid membranes showed greater noise levels (η² ≥ 050), indicating a 
larger variance in their amounts Metabolic noise measurements can provide insight on how tightly the metabolite levels are regulated, and how that relates 
to their biological function
