## Steps to Reproduce
Create a view with a text input, and a submit callback listener. In the submit
listener, call something like `Navigator.popAndPushNamed()`. This will result
in the following error message:
    E/flutter (11330): 'package:flutter/src/widgets/routes.dart': Failed assertion: line 200 pos 12: '!_transitionCompleter.isCompleted': Cannot reuse a MaterialPageRoute after disposing it.
Probably not the best error message to read.
Through a conversation on the flutter gitter I found that dismissing the
keyboard using `Focus.clear(context);` before popping the view resolved the
error.
I propose the error message is changed to be more helpful towards this
(seemingly quite common) error case - something like 'If you're popping and
pushing a route with a text input, make sure you dismiss the keyboard using
`Focus.clear(BuildContext)` before changing the route. Failing to do this
results in the navigator trying to double-pop the keyboard.` or something
along those lines!
I'd quite like to open a PR for this, I just want to check I haven't totally
misunderstood what's going on underneath the hood!
Thanks,
