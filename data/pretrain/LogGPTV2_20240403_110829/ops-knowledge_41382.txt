User: Please provide a scalable messaging solution to pass messages in a distributed system.
Assistant: A scalable messaging solution is to use message queues. The message queue provides an asynchronous and reliable message delivery mechanism, which can pass messages from the sender to the receiver without direct interaction, realizing decoupling and asynchronous processing. At the same time, the message queue also supports concurrent processing of multiple producers and consumers, which can easily expand the system. Specifically, when using the message queue solution, it is necessary to define the format and content of the message first, and then send the message to the message queue. The receiver can subscribe to a specific message queue to receive messages that need to be processed and perform corresponding business processing. At the same time, by configuring multiple nodes to process messages, horizontal expansion can be realized and the processing throughput of the system can be improved. Common message queues include Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, etc. You can choose an appropriate message queue as a solution according to your specific needs.
