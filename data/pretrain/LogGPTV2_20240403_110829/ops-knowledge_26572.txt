User: I'm running Ubuntu to compile a set of code which requires python 2.4.
How can I setup a terminal launcher so that when I open that launcher all python related commands will use python 2.4 instead of the python 2.6 that is defaulted in Ubuntu?
Assistant: For a permenant system wide change put a symbolic link to the version you want in place of /usr/bin/python. ie
rm /usr/bin/python;
ln -s /usr/bin/python2.4 /usr/bin/python
gentoo has a program 'eselect' which is for just this kind of thing (listing versions of programs and setting the default), Ubuntu may have something analogous; you'd have to check their docs.
