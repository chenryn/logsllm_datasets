### Packet Sampling with SYN and SEQ (PS+SYN+SEQ)

#### Packet Sampling with SYN (PS+SYN)
1. **Initial Sampling:**
   - Perform packet sampling (PS) with a parameter \( p_p \).
   - In the post-processing phase, discard all packets from sampled flows that lack a SYN packet. This method was introduced in [1] and referred to as "SYN-pktct" in [4].

2. **Benefits and Drawbacks:**
   - **Benefit:** PS+SYN mitigates the flow length bias of PS by retaining flows based on the presence of the SYN packet, which is independent of flow length.
   - **Drawback:** It is inefficient. For example, if \( p_p = 0.01 \), 99% of initially sampled packets belong to 'failed' flows and are discarded.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - A flow is considered failed if its SYN is not sampled, hence \( b_{0k} = q_p \).
   - For \( j \geq 1 \), the SYN must first be sampled with probability \( p_p \). Conditioned on this, \( j-1 \) more packets must be sampled from the remaining \( k-1 \) packets using i.i.d. sampling. Thus,
     \[
     b_{jk} = p_p \cdot \binom{k-1}{j-1} p_p^{j-1} q_p^{k-j}
     \]
   - The matrix \( B \) can be represented as:
     \[
     B = \begin{pmatrix}
     q_p & p_p & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\
     0 & p_p q_p & p_p^2 & 0 & \cdots \\
     0 & 0 & p_p q_p^2 & p_p^2 & \cdots \\
     \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]

4. **Inverse of \( \tilde{B} \):**
   - The inverse of \( \tilde{B} \) is given by:
     \[
     \tilde{B}^{-1} = \frac{1}{p_p} \left( I - \frac{q_p}{p_p} J \right)^{-1}
     \]
   - Where \( J \) is a matrix with ones on the subdiagonal and zeros elsewhere.

#### Packet Sampling with SYN and SEQ (PS+SYN+SEQ)
1. **Combination of Methods:**
   - First, perform sampling according to PS+SYN with parameter \( p_p \).
   - Then, for each resulting sampled flow, apply sequence number post-processing as in PS+SEQ. This method is called "SYN-seq" in [4].
   - PS+SYN+SEQ combines the advantages and disadvantages of both PS+SYN and PS+SEQ.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - If \( j = 0 \) or \( j = 1 \), sequence numbers cannot help, and \( b_{jk} \) is the same as for PS+SYN.
   - For \( j > 1 \), combining the arguments above, we get:
     \[
     b_{jk} = p_p \cdot \binom{k-1}{j-1} p_p^{j-1} q_p^{k-j}
     \]
   - The matrix \( B \) can be represented as:
     \[
     B = \begin{pmatrix}
     q_p & p_p & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\
     0 & p_p q_p & p_p^2 & 0 & \cdots \\
     0 & 0 & p_p q_p^2 & p_p^2 & \cdots \\
     \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots
     \end{pmatrix}
     \]

3. **Inverse of \( \tilde{B} \):**
   - The inverse of \( \tilde{B} \) is:
     \[
     \tilde{B}^{-1} = \frac{1}{p_p} \left( I - \frac{q_p}{p_p} J \right)^{-1}
     \]
   - Where \( J \) is a matrix with ones on the subdiagonal and zeros elsewhere.

By clearly defining the steps and providing the mathematical formulations, the text becomes more structured and easier to understand.
