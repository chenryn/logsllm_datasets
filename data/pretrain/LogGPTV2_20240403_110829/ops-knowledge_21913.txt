User: I have written a small python script that i want to share with other users.(i want to keep it as a script rather than and exe so that users can edit the codes if they need to)
my script has several external libraries for python which doesn't come with basic python.
But the other users doesn't have python and the required libraries  installed in their PCs .
So,For convenient, I am wondering if there's any way to automate the installation process for installing python and the external libraries they need.
To make things more clear, what i meant is to combine all the installers into 1 single big installer.
For you information, all the installers are window x86 MSI installers and there are about 5 or 6 of them.
Is this possible?Could there be any drawbacks of doing this?
EDIT:
All the users are using windows XP  pro 32 bit 
python 2.7
Assistant: I would suggest using NSIS. You can bundle all the MSI installers (including python) into one executable, and install them in "silent mode" in whatever order you want. NSIS also has a great script generator you can download.
Also, you might be interested in activepython. It comes with pip and automatically adds everything to your path so you can just pip install most of your dependencies from a batch script.
