ICMP: TCP- and UDP-related ICMP forwarding. Many NATs
attempt to translate ICMP messages related to TCP and UDP bind-
ings, because this can improve application performance. The most
important ICMP messages to translate are Destination Unreach-
able messages indicating that fragmentation is needed, which TCP
uses for PMTU discovery [22]. If they are not translated properly,
PMTU “black hole” issues can occur [17]. For UDP, even detection
of port reachability depends on ICMP messages. We test whether
ICMP messages are correctly translated by hijacking packets com-
ing from the NAT, generating ICMP messages of the desired kind
that are sent back to the NAT, and inspecting packet traces to deter-
mine what the NAT actually did.
SCTP and DCCP: Support for SCTP and DCCP. Deployment of
these transport protocols is said to be hindered by middleboxes that
do not support them. We therefore determine the level of support
for SCTP [30] and DCCP [15,16] among the home gateways in our
testbed. For each of these transport protocols, we attempt to create

a single connection and exchange data. If this succeeds, a home
gateway supports the respective transport.
DNS: DNS over TCP. The DNS proxy on each NAT is tested
for support of DNS-over-TCP by querying it using dig from the
Berkeley Internet Name Daemon (BIND) suite.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section presents the measurement results for the experi-
ments described in Section 3. All plots show the measured results
across the entire population of studied home gateways, arranged on
the x-axis by increasing value. Each data point shown is the median
of many repetitions of a measurement, as indicated in the plot leg-
end. Quartiles for each data point are plotted as error bars, but the
inter-quartile gap is usually too narrow for them to become visible.
4.1 UDP Timeout Results
Section 3.2.1 described a measurement method for determining
UDP binding timeouts as well as several binding usage scenarios.
This section presents the experimental results obtained from ap-
plying this method in these different scenarios. From Figure 2, it
is apparent that home gateways do not behave consistently in the
different UDP tests. While it is clear that many devices do not
vary their timeout behavior between tests UDP-2 and UDP-3, the
timeouts do vary with manufacturers and ﬁrmware versions. Most
devices retain UDP bindings for the 120 sec required in [3], at least
while there is inbound trafﬁc over the binding. UDP-1 presents
a more unusual case, where the binding is often removed much
sooner. The next paragraphs discuss the detailed results.
UDP-1: Figure 3 plots the medians of measured binding time-
outs for the UDP-1 case, where the client sends only a single packet
to the server. Quartiles are plotted as error bars but the inter-quartile
range is too narrow to become visible, indicating stable results
for all devices. One obvious result is that UDP binding timeouts
vary by an order of magnitude across the measured set of home
gateways. The je device is among those with the shortest timeout
(30 sec), whereas ls1 has a timeout that is more than twenty times
longer (691 sec). The median timeout across the entire set is 90 sec,
the mean is 160 sec. Note that more than half of the tested devices
do not conform to the IETF speciﬁcation [3] that requires timeouts
of more than 120 sec; and only a single device (ls1) complies with
the longer 600 sec timeout that the IETF recommends.
UDP-2: Figure 4 shows the measurements for the case where the
server sends a stream of response packets to the client. The intent of
this measurement was to determine whether inbound trafﬁc affects
the binding timeout, and for many devices, it does. Most devices
here tend to use longer timeouts; the minimum is now 54 sec, the
median is 180 sec and the mean 175 sec. For example, ed, owrt,
to, and te, which shared the shortest timeout (30 sec) in the UDP-1
case, now use a median timeout of 180 sec. Other devices, however,
shorten their timeouts now, e.g., be2, which had a timeout of ca.
450 sec previously, now reduces its timeout to ca. 202 sec. The
inter-quartile range for we and al as well as, to a lesser degree, je
and ng5 is substantial, because these boxes seem to use very coarse-
grained binding timers.
UDP-3: Figure 5 plots the measurements for the case where a
received server response triggers the client to send another packet.
The intent of this test is to check whether outbound trafﬁc on a
binding affects the timeout. The difference to UDP-2 is less pro-
nounced; the median timeout remains almost unchanged, although
the mean increases to 226 sec. This is mostly due to a few devices
(be1, dl10, ng3 ng4, and esp. be2 and ng5) lengthening their time-
outs as outbound packets are now also present, reaching the same
level as in the UDP-1 test; no devices shorten them.
UDP-4: The results show that different behaviors exist for how
NATs choose external port numbers and how they reuse port pairs.
Most of the devices (27 out of 34) prefer to use the original source
port as the external port for a binding. 23 of these devices seem to
also reuse an expired binding, while 4 devices create a new binding.
7 devices do not attempt to use the original source port and seem to
always create a new binding after an old one expired.
UDP-5: Figure 6 shows the median measured binding timeouts
to different well-known server ports. The results indicate that most
devices use a timeout scheme that is independent of the server port.
Notable exception is dl8, which uses a shorter timeout for the DNS
port.
4.2 TCP Results
This section discusses the results of the TCP tests described in
Section 3.2.2.
TCP-1: Figure 7 shows the measured TCP binding timeouts.
Because the measured timeouts are highly variable, the plot uses
a log scale to highlight the differences. be1 has the shortest time-
out; it consistently times out TCP bindings after 239 sec – less than
4 min. More than half the devices fail to meet the IETF recom-
mended timeout of 124 min [11]. Some of the NATs retain TCP
bindings for considerably longer – the seven devices on the right in
Figure 7 still had not timed out their bindings after 24 h (1,440 min),
which was the cutoff for this test.

Figure 8: TCP-2: Medians of measured throughputs.
Figure 9: TCP-3: Median of measured delays.
TCP-2: Figure 8 shows the medians of the measured TCP
throughputs for each device. Thirteen devices can sustain the max-
imum possible throughput of 100 Mb/sec for uploads and down-
loads, but other devices fail to do so: The median throughput across
the device set is roughly 59 Mb/sec for unidirectional uploads and
downloads.
For the bidirectional tests, the devices that achieve the best per-
formance in the unidirectional tests continue to demonstrate higher
throughputs, though not all reach 100 Mb/sec in both directions.
There is a marked distinction in the performance of some devices:
many are incapable of handling more than 50 Mb/sec of trafﬁc in
either direction. Further, the median in the bidirectional case is ca.
35 Mb/sec, which is much lower than the 68 Mb/sec in the unidirec-
tional case. There are extremely poor performers in this test, dl10
and ls1 being the worst performers dl10 and ls1 can only sustain
unidirectional throughput of around 6 Mb/sec and 8 Mb/sec respec-
tively for download and 6 Mb/sec each for upload. Some other de-
vices also demonstrate a distinct difference in upload and download
throughputs: smc, for example, can sustain 41 Mb/sec for upload,
but only 27 Mb/sec for download.
The poor throughput of many devices may normally go unno-
ticed: the WAN port will generally connect to the user’s ISP over a
link with a much lower capacity than 100 Mb/sec.
TCP-3: Figure 9 shows the results for queuing and processing
delays introduced by the devices. Perhaps not surprisingly, the de-
vices that perform well in the throughput tests (TCP-2) also per-
form well in the latency test. Bidirectional trafﬁc increases laten-
cies slightly for most of the devices, more signiﬁcantly so for the
poorest performers, which are ls1 and dl10. The median latency
for dl10 is 74 msec when downloading only but jumps to 291 msec
when uploading at the same time, whereas the median latency for
ls1 is 110 msec when uploading only but reaches 400 msec when
downloading at the same time. Even the best-performing boxes see
minor delay increases of ca. 2 msec.

NAT allows to a single server port. dl9 and smc support only 16
bindings, whereas ng1 and ap allow ca. 1024 bindings; the median
is 135.
4.3 Other Results
Table 2 shows pass/fail results for the tests described in Sec-
tion 3.2.3 related to SCTP and DCCP support, DNS-over-TCP sup-
port, and ICMP handling.
ICMP: The “TCP” and “UDP” columns in Table 2 indicate
which home gateways correctly translate various ICMP messages
related to ﬂows of the respective transport protocol. nw1 does not
translate any transport-related ICMP messages; all others translate

at least “Port Unreachable” and “TTL Exceeded”.
all TCP-related ICMP messages into (invalid) TCP resets. About
half of the devices (16 out of 34) do not correctly translate trans-
port headers contained in ICMP payloads, and zy1 and ls1 do not
correctly translate IP checksums in ICMP payloads.
SCTP and DCCP: It is possible to establish an SCTP connec-
tion through 18 of the 34 devices – an astounding result, since the
general belief has been that even single-homed SCTP connections
do not usually work across NATs. None of the devices allowed es-
tablishing a DCCP connection. dl4, dl9, dl10 and ls1 pass SCTP
and DCCP packets entirely untranslated, 20 others attempt to sim-
ply translate the IP source address. Among those 20 devices are
all those that work with SCTP – which raises the question if they
actually fully support SCTP, or whether a single SCTP connection
