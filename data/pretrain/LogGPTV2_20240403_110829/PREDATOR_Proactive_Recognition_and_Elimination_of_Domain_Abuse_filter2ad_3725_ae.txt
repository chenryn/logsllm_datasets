### Cost Implications of Multi-Year Domain Registrations

Registering domains for multi-year terms, as required by rank 22, incurs higher costs due to the need for advance payment. Verisign charges an annual fee of $7.85 per .com domain registration to registrars [58]. Miscreants can obtain lower prices, close to this amount, from registrars associated with scam activities (e.g., ABSystems [50]) or those offering discounts. If miscreants switch to GoDaddy, the largest registrar, which charges $12.99 annually [17], and register in small batches without bulk discounts, committing to a 2-year term, the cost per domain would be approximately 3.3 times higher than what they originally pay. Specifically, the cost would rise from $7.85 × 2 = $15.70 to $12.99, a 3.3-fold increase.

### Evading Detection by Reducing Volume

To evade some of PREDATOR's features, miscreants must limit the volume of domains they register. For instance, to avoid detection by the life-cycle proportion features (rank 14-16), miscreants might mix different life-cycle types of domains in the same batch. However, this approach requires multiple methods for generating domain names, increasing management effort. We observe that spammer domains have a lower brand-new proportion (66%) compared to non-spammer domains (77%). To mimic the life-cycle proportions of general domains, miscreants need to reduce re-registration domains. Solving the equation 100% - A% = 77%, we find that miscreants must alter 14% of their domain registrations. This estimate shows the impact of evading a single feature. To change other behaviors, such as lexical or registrar features, miscreants may need to further reduce their domain registrations.

Another feature is the dormancy period for re-registration domains (rank 9). Miscreants often re-register recently expired domains, likely because they actively mine these. Evading the dormancy period feature forces miscreants to wait longer before registering expired domains, thereby limiting the number of domains they can use over a given period. In summary, evasion attempts significantly increase economic and management costs for attackers, making it more difficult for them to acquire and profitably use domains. The combination of PREDATOR's features effectively detects malicious domains, and altering one or two features will not substantially help miscreants avoid detection.

### Discussion

#### Deployment Scenarios

PREDATOR can be deployed in various ways to benefit network operators and security practitioners:

1. **Network Operators**: Email servers can greylist (temporarily reject) emails flagged by PREDATOR and request the originating servers to retry after a period. Legitimate senders are expected to resend, while spammers typically do not handle retries properly [36]. Network operators can also collect more evidence before retry attempts, such as examining the web content on the domain.
   
2. **Registries and Registrars**: They can require stricter documentation or verification (e.g., validating payment instruments or inquiring about the domain purpose) before approving registrations of domains with low reputation scores. This aligns with the registrars' responsibilities under ICANN’s Registrar Accreditation Agreement [26] and helps identify and deter illegal registrations with stolen credit cards [11, 14].

3. **Law Enforcement and Cyber-Security Professionals**: They can prioritize investigations and proactively monitor low-reputation domains, as PREDATOR-selected domains are more likely to be malicious. This can aid in time- and resource-intensive analyses, such as crawling page content or repeated manual investigations.

4. **Incorporation into Other Systems**: PREDATOR can be integrated into other detection systems (e.g., spam filters, botnet detection systems) to provide an additional "confidence score" for domain registrations, helping determine if a domain appears malicious.

#### Limitations and Future Work

While PREDATOR provides centralized observation opportunities for domain registrations under a single zone, miscreants may register domains across different TLDs, especially with the expansion of new TLDs [27]. Future work should incorporate cross-zone features into the classification model. Additionally, although PREDATOR is somewhat resistant to evasion, designing a more robust system against continuous evasion attempts is necessary. While our approach achieves good accuracy, higher detection rates come with increased false positives. Combining post-registration detection techniques, such as DNS monitoring or web crawling, could enhance hierarchical decision-making mechanisms for better accuracy.

### Related Work

#### DNS-Based Detection

Most previous DNS-based detection studies focused on analyzing lookup traffic. Notos [3] and EXPOSURE [5] leverage traffic from local recursive DNS servers to establish domain reputations. Gao et al. used temporal correlation in DNS queries to detect malicious domain groups [16]. Other work has analyzed DNS traffic to detect fast-flux domains [24, 44] or malware domains using resource records [9, 31, 66]. Some studies inspect DNS traffic near top-level domain servers to detect abnormal activity [4, 19]. In contrast, PREDATOR uses registration features to enable early detection without monitoring DNS traffic.

#### Registration and Domain Market

Recent research has examined registrars, registries, and the domain market, including domain-name speculation, typosquatting, and domain parking [1, 2, 7, 54, 61]. Liu et al. found that registry policy changes and registrar-level takedown had at least temporary effects in deterring spam-advertised domains [37]. Felegyhazi et al. investigated registration information to extrapolate malicious domains, primarily relying on DNS server properties [13]. Hao et al. measured and modeled domain registrations of spammer domains [20]. While their work only presented preliminary results, it suggested the potential of building a registration-based reputation system. PREDATOR was designed to accurately detect spammer domains at the time of registration and studied significantly more features.

#### Website and URL Detection

A conventional technique for detecting malicious web pages is through automatic URL crawling tools. Detection can be based on page content [43, 57], cloaking and redirection [35, 62], or link structure [64]. Thomas et al. built a large-scale system to crawl URLs in email and Twitter feeds to detect malicious messages [55]. Our study is orthogonal to web crawling methods and does not require page visits. PREDATOR's output can help prioritize suspect sites for crawling and inspection. Another approach is to use lexical and host-based features of URLs for detection, excluding web page content [38, 39, 65]. These methods require waiting until miscreants use the URLs for attacks. PREDATOR, on the other hand, provides proactive detection of domains before malicious URLs propagate on the Internet.

### Conclusion

Establishing DNS domain name reputation quickly is crucial for defending against many Internet attacks. While existing DNS reputation systems base domain reputation on features evident after the domain is in use, PREDATOR can accurately establish domain reputation at the time of registration, before domains are used in attacks. Our results show that PREDATOR provides more accurate and earlier detection compared to existing blacklists, significantly reducing the number of suspicious domains requiring more resource-intensive or time-consuming inspection.
