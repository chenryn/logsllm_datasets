I am currently using Windows 7 64-bit as my host operating system and Debian AMD64 as the guest OS. On my Windows machine, a folder named "www" is mounted on the Debian system at `/home/me/www`.

I have successfully installed Plone on Debian (the guest OS) using the unified installer. However, when I attempt to change the default installation path from `/home/me/Plone` to `/home/me/www/plone`, the installation consistently fails due to Python not being able to install properly. The `install.log` file indicates the following error:

```
ln: failed to create hard link 'python' => 'python2.6': Operation not permitted
```

It appears that this issue might be related to access permissions. I have tried running the installation script both with `sudo` and as a regular user, but neither approach resolves the problem. The script works fine in other directories, just not within the shared folder in VirtualBox.

Do you have any suggestions for resolving this issue?

**Additional Information:**
- I do not have a root account on Debian (testing version, with the system Python version being 2.7) and always use `sudo`.
- Could using `mount --bind` in Debian to mount specific host folders to parts of the installation tree be a potential solution?
