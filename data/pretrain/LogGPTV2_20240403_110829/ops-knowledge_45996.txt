User: I'm running Windows 7 64bit as my Host OS and Debian AMD64 as my Guest OS. On my Windows machine a folder called www is mounted on Debian under /home/me/www.
I have no problem installing Plone on Debian (the guest OS) with the unified installer. However, when I try to change the default install path from /home/me/Plone to /home/me/www/plone, the installation always fails because Python fails to install. In the install.log it says 
ln: failed to create hard link 'python' => 'python2.6': Operation not permitted
It looks like it might have something to do with access permissions, but I have tried to run the install script either using sudo or as a normal user, none of it helps. The script installs fine elsewhere, just not in the shared folder in Virtualbox. 
Any suggestions?
More Information: I don't have a root account on Debian (testing, System Python version is 2.7) and always use sudo.
Assistant: How about using Debian's mount --bind to mount specific Host folders to portions of the installation tree?
