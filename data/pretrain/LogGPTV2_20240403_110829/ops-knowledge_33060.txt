User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the initialization of multiple child processes in the scoreboard slots 6-9 and 7-8. The workerEnv.init() is successful for each process, but the mod_jk child workerEnv is in error state 6 and 7.
