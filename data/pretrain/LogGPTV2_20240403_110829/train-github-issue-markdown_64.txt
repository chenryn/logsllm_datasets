Became important when you extend, for example, `DefaultValueAccessor` to work
with `ng-model`  
and see a list of errors:
    ERROR in ./rating/rating.ts
    (50,5): Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target. (2346)
    ERROR in ./timepicker/timepicker.ts
    (151,5): Supplied parameters do not match any signature of call target. (2346)
    ...
I was trying to do it my self but, but constructor type parameters are come as
string, not parsed, to dgeni templates
