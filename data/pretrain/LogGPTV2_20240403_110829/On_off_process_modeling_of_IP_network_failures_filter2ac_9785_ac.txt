### 5.4 Access Network Analysis

Access to Funet's network is facilitated by short access links connecting nodes such as lut3 and uku3. The reliability of these connections is primarily influenced by the variability in the number of routers and the occurrence of joint failures. In addition, the router furthest from Ficix, urova3, experiences the lowest reliability due to its distance.

The likelihood of a link failure increases with the length of the link. We model this feature linearly by scaling the link length. The failure intensity \( A(L) \) is defined as:
- \( A(L) = 3.18443 \times 10^{-7} \) if \( L < 25 \)
- \( A(L) = 3.18443 \times 10^{-6} \) if \( L \geq 25 \)

where \( AR = 3.18443 \times 10^{-7} \) is the failure intensity of a router, and \( L \) is the link length in kilometers. The longest link will have a failure intensity 10 times that of a router.

We summarize our component intensity models for uptime and downtime durations as follows:
- Router (R): Pareto(60, 2.3), exp(AR)
- Short Link (SL): Pareto(m(L), 2.3), exp(A(L))
- Long Link (LL): Pareto(m(L), 2.3), exp(A(L))

where \( m(L) \) is determined by equation (6) and \( A(L) \) by equation (7).

### 5.5 Pareto vs. Exponential Downtime Durations

Traditionally, both uptime and downtime durations are modeled using exponentially distributed variables. However, in this study, we use Pareto-distributed variables for downtime durations, which can provide more realistic estimates. Figure 5 illustrates the difference between Pareto and exponential downtime frequency curves for sample access routers csc4, helsinki3, and shh3.

### 5.6 Risk Comparison of Access Routers

The IP-availability of routers in northern Finland, such as oulu3 and urova3, is lower than in the south, but they carry far less traffic. To assess the risk, we estimate the probability of failure and the resulting loss in traffic. Figure 6 shows the estimated lost traffic during one year due to joint failures, with color codes indicating the amount of lost traffic.

### 5.7 Comparison of Reliability Strategies

We compare different strategies to improve the reliability of Funet's network:
- **Proactive**: Focuses on reducing the failure intensity.
- **Reactive**: Reduces the minimum duration of failures.
- **On-time**: Changes the shape parameter of the Pareto distribution.

Figure 7 demonstrates the impact of these strategies on the reliability of access routers csc3, uwasa3, and urova3. The proactive strategy has the most significant impact on long failure durations, while the reactive strategy affects short failure durations.

### 6. Conclusions and Discussion

The reliability of long links depends on the link length, with failure intensity and minimum duration changing linearly. Our methodology, based on non-Markovian modeling, provides a useful approach for analyzing IP networks beyond the traditional Markovian paradigm. This approach requires no simulations and can be used by network operators to assess and improve the reliability of their networks.

Understanding the heterogeneity in reliability is crucial for setting well-founded SLAs. Our work highlights the importance of collecting and storing accurate failure data, which is currently lacking in many public datasets. More research is needed to understand the dependencies between network components and to develop practical models for dependent failures.
