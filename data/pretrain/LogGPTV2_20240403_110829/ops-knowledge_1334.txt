I have created a virtual environment for my project, but I am unable to activate it. The issue might be related to syntax or the folder location, but I'm currently unsure how to resolve it.

Below are the steps I followed:
1. I created the virtual environment and named it `venv`. Everything seemed to work correctly.
2. I tried to activate the virtual environment by running `source venv/bin/activate`.

I suspect the problem might be related to my system path, but I'm not sure what to set it to (I do know how to edit the path). I am using Python 3.7 on Windows OS with virtualenv version 20.2.x.

Here is the output from the terminal:

```plaintext

The --no-site-packages flag is deprecated; it is now the default behavior.

**Solution:**

The `source` command is specific to Unix-based systems (like Linux and macOS) and is not recognized in the Windows Command Prompt. On Windows, you should use the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```plaintext
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>venv\Scripts\activate
```

If you are using PowerShell, the command is slightly different:

```powershell
c:\testdjangoproj\mysite>.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use a Unix-like environment on Windows, you can use Cygwin or Git Bash, where the `source` command will work as expected.

For example, in Cygwin or Git Bash, you would run:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

This should activate your virtual environment successfully.
