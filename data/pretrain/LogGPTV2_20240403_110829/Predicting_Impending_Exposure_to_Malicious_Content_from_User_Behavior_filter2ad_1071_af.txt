The next group of questions (borrowed from RSeBIS, [73]) takes,
as answers, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Completely dis-
agree” to “Perfectly agree.”
(1) When someone sends me a link, I open it only after verifying
where it goes.
(2) I know what website I’m visiting by looking at the URL bar,
rather than by the website’s look and feel.
(3) I verify that information will be sent securely (e.g., SSL,
“https://,” a lock icon) before I submit it to websites.
(4) When browsing websites, I mouse-over links to see where
(5) If I discover a security problem, I fix or report it rather than
they go, before clicking them.

Finally, the last group of questions on self-confidence also takes,
as answers, a 5-point Likert scale ranging from “Completely dis-
agree” to “Perfectly agree.”
(1) I know about countermeasures for keeping the data on my
device from being exploited.
(2) I know about countermeasures to protect myself from mon-
etary loss when using the Internet.
