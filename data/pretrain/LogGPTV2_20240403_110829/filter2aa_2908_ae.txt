USB Stick 
It is possible to run DAVIX from a USB stick. This has the advantages that booting 
from stick in general is faster and it allows for changes to be made persistent. The 
following step-by-step instructions will help you to achieve this. 
The procedures were successfully tested with following USB sticks: 
• SanDisk Cruzer TITANIUM, 4GB 
• SanDisk Cruzer Micro, 4 GB 
• SONY Micro Vault, 1 GB 
• Pretec 02GB Cha Cha, 2 GB 
A word of warning: 
• To avoid data loss the system should be shutdown properly before removing 
the USB stick. In particular the VFAT is quite prone to such abuse. If you 
want to have a robust solution use xfs as file system instead. For details see xfs 
instruction below. 
6.3.1. On Windows with VFAT Formatted USB Stick 
• First of all you have to get a USB stick currently a USB stick with at least 1 
GB is recommended. If you have more it should work as well. 
• If the USB is supports U3 it is necessary to uninstall the U3 feature using the 
tool provided by following web-site: http://www.u3.com/uninstall/. 
83 / 111 
• Then open the MMC console and add the Disk Management Snap-in. 
• Format the USB stick partition with FAT32 and the default allocation unit size. 
84 / 111 
• Copy from the DAVIX CD/DVD the directories boot and slax to the USB 
stick. 
• Writing to the flash memory will take a while. So grab a coffee. J 
• Open the DOS prompt and navigate to the boot directory on the USB stick. 
• Execute bootinst.bat and acknowledge the messages. The USB stick is now 
made bootable. 
• Reboot your system and boot from USB stick. When you are seeing the 
DAVIX boot menu you are done! 
85 / 111 
6.3.2. On Linux with VFAT Formatted USB Stick 
Although VFAT is supported by the SLAX kernel the mkfs.vfat is missing on the 
SLAX image. Therefore the first steps have to done in Windows. 
• First of all you have to get a USB stick currently a USB stick with at least 1 
GB is recommended. If you have more it should work as well.  
• If the USB is supports U3 it is necessary to uninstall the U3 feature using the 
tool provided by following web-site: http://www.u3.com/uninstall/. 
• Then open the MMC console and add the Disk Management Snap-in. 
• Format the USB stick partition with FAT32 and the default allocation size. 
• Leave the USB inserted in the computer. 
• Boot DAVIX from CD-ROM. 
• Open a console. 
• The USB should have been mounted automatically to /mnt/sda1. Execute 
mount to cross-check. 
root@slax:~# mount 
aufs on / type aufs (rw) 
proc on /proc type proc (rw) 
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw) 
usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw) 
/dev/sda1 on /mnt/sda1 type vfat 
(rw,noatime,quiet,umask=0,check=s,shortname=mixed) 
root@slax:~# . 
• Then copy the directories boot and slax to the USB stick. 
cp -pvR /mnt/live/mnt/hdc/boot /mnt/live/mnt/hdc/slax /mnt/sda1 
• Writing to the flash memory will take a while. So grab a coffee. J 
• Change to the boot directory on the USB stick: cd /mnt/sda1/boot 
• Execute ./bootinst.sh and acknowledge the messages. The USB stick is now 
made bootable.

• Leave the USB inserted in the computer. 
• Boot DAVIX from CD-ROM in KDE mode. 
• Open a console. 
• To find out which device ID your hard disk has execute the command:  
sfdisk --list. For simplicity of this example sda has been chosen. Your device 
ID may be different. So watch out! 
root@slax:~# sfdisk --list

/dev/sda1 on /mnt/sda1 type xfs (rw,noatime) 
• If there is still a file system (e.g. sda1) mounted then unmount it: 
umount /dev/sda1 
• Wipe the USB stick to avoid later problems when installing the boot loader: 
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M 
root@slax:~# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M 
dd: writing `/dev/sda': No space left on device

4110227968 bytes (4.1 GB) copied, 557.438 s, 7.4 MB/s 
• Then we have to partition the hard drive. Execute: fdisk /dev/sda 
root@slax:~# fdisk /dev/sda

6.4. 
Hard Drive 
DAVIX can also be installed on hard disk where all SLAX modules have been 
extracted. These instructions are based in parts on the paper published by Offensive 
Security16. 
A word of warning: 
• According to BackTrack the BackTrack Installer is experimental and has not 
yet been tested! It is therefore highly recommended to work with an empty 
hard drive or use VMware. 
Here is the procedure for installing DAVIX on hard disk: 
• Boot DAVIX from CD or DVD in KDE mode. Make sure there are no other 
hard drive devices attached than the one you want DAVIX onto. 
• To find out which device ID your hard disk has execute the command: sfdisk -
-list. For simplicity of this example hda has been chosen. Your device ID may 
be different. So watch out! 
root@slax:~# sfdisk --list 
Disk /dev/hda: 9733 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors/track 
Units = cylinders of 8225280 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, counting from 0 
   Device Boot Start     End   #cyls    #blocks   Id  System

/dev/hda4          0       -       0          0    0  Empty 
• First we have to partition the hard drive. Execute: fdisk /dev/hda 
root@slax:~# fdisk /dev/hda 
The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 9733. 
There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024, 
and could in certain setups cause problems with: 
1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO) 
2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs 
   (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK) 
• Create first partition according to the options below: 
Command (m for help): n 
Command action 
   e   extended 
   p   primary partition (1-4)

• Change the partition type of partition #2 to 82 for Linux Swap: 
Command (m for help): t
