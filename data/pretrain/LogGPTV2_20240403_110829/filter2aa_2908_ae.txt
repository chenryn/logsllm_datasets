### 6.3. USB Stick Installation

#### Overview
DAVIX can be installed and run from a USB stick. This method offers several advantages, including faster boot times and the ability to make persistent changes. The following step-by-step instructions will guide you through the process.

#### Tested USB Sticks
The installation procedures have been successfully tested with the following USB sticks:
- **SanDisk Cruzer TITANIUM, 4GB**
- **SanDisk Cruzer Micro, 4GB**
- **SONY Micro Vault, 1GB**
- **Pretec 02GB Cha Cha, 2GB**

#### Important Note
To prevent data loss, ensure that the system is properly shut down before removing the USB stick. The VFAT file system is particularly susceptible to data corruption if the device is removed without proper shutdown. For a more robust solution, consider using the XFS file system. Refer to the XFS instructions below for more details.

### 6.3.1. Windows with VFAT Formatted USB Stick

1. **Acquire a USB Stick**: Obtain a USB stick with at least 1GB of storage. A larger capacity will also work.
2. **Uninstall U3 Feature (if applicable)**: If your USB stick supports U3, uninstall the feature using the tool provided at [http://www.u3.com/uninstall/](http://www.u3.com/uninstall/).
3. **Open Disk Management**:
   - Open the MMC console and add the Disk Management Snap-in.
   - Format the USB stick partition with FAT32 and the default allocation unit size.
4. **Copy DAVIX Files**:
   - Copy the `boot` and `slax` directories from the DAVIX CD/DVD to the USB stick.
   - This process may take some time, so feel free to take a break.
5. **Make the USB Stick Bootable**:
   - Open the DOS prompt and navigate to the `boot` directory on the USB stick.
   - Execute `bootinst.bat` and follow the prompts. The USB stick is now bootable.
6. **Reboot and Test**:
   - Reboot your system and boot from the USB stick. When you see the DAVIX boot menu, the installation is complete.

### 6.3.2. Linux with VFAT Formatted USB Stick

Although the SLAX kernel supports VFAT, the `mkfs.vfat` utility is missing from the SLAX image. Therefore, the initial steps must be performed on a Windows system.

1. **Acquire a USB Stick**: Obtain a USB stick with at least 1GB of storage. A larger capacity will also work.
2. **Uninstall U3 Feature (if applicable)**: If your USB stick supports U3, uninstall the feature using the tool provided at [http://www.u3.com/uninstall/](http://www.u3.com/uninstall/).
3. **Open Disk Management**:
   - Open the MMC console and add the Disk Management Snap-in.
   - Format the USB stick partition with FAT32 and the default allocation unit size.
4. **Prepare for Linux**:
   - Leave the USB stick inserted in the computer.
   - Boot DAVIX from the CD-ROM.
   - Open a console.
5. **Verify Mount Point**:
   - The USB stick should be automatically mounted to `/mnt/sda1`. Use the `mount` command to verify.
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# mount
     aufs on / type aufs (rw)
     proc on /proc type proc (rw)
     sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
     usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
     /dev/sda1 on /mnt/sda1 type vfat (rw,noatime,quiet,umask=0,check=s,shortname=mixed)
     ```
6. **Copy DAVIX Files**:
   - Copy the `boot` and `slax` directories to the USB stick.
     ```bash
     cp -pvR /mnt/live/mnt/hdc/boot /mnt/live/mnt/hdc/slax /mnt/sda1
     ```
   - This process may take some time, so feel free to take a break.
7. **Make the USB Stick Bootable**:
   - Change to the `boot` directory on the USB stick: `cd /mnt/sda1/boot`
   - Execute `./bootinst.sh` and follow the prompts. The USB stick is now bootable.
8. **Reboot and Test**:
   - Reboot your system and boot from the USB stick. When you see the DAVIX boot menu, the installation is complete.

### 6.3.3. Linux with XFS Formatted USB Stick

1. **Acquire a USB Stick**: Obtain a USB stick with at least 1GB of storage. A larger capacity will also work.
2. **Uninstall U3 Feature (if applicable)**: If your USB stick supports U3, uninstall the feature using the tool provided at [http://www.u3.com/uninstall/](http://www.u3.com/uninstall/).
3. **Prepare for Linux**:
   - Leave the USB stick inserted in the computer.
   - Boot DAVIX from the CD-ROM in KDE mode.
   - Open a console.
4. **Identify the USB Device**:
   - Use the `sfdisk --list` command to identify the device ID of your USB stick. For this example, we assume it is `/dev/sda`.
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# sfdisk --list
     Disk /dev/sda: 1019 cylinders, 127 heads, 62 sectors/track
     Units = cylinders of 4031488 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, counting from 0
        Device Boot Start     End   #cyls    #blocks   Id  System
     /dev/sda1   *      0+   1018    1019-   4011772   83  Linux
     /dev/sda2          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     /dev/sda3          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     /dev/sda4          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     ```
5. **Unmount File Systems**:
   - Use the `mount` command to ensure all file systems on the USB stick are unmounted.
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# mount
     aufs on / type aufs (rw)
     proc on /proc type proc (rw)
     sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
     usbfs on /proc/bus/usb type usbfs (rw)
     /dev/hda1 on /mnt/hda1 type ext3 (rw,noatime)
     /dev/hda3 on /mnt/hda3 type ext3 (rw,noatime)
     /dev/sda1 on /mnt/sda1 type xfs (rw,noatime)
     ```
   - If any file systems are still mounted, unmount them: `umount /dev/sda1`
6. **Wipe the USB Stick**:
   - Wipe the USB stick to avoid issues when installing the boot loader: `dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M`
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M
     dd: writing `/dev/sda': No space left on device
     3920+0 records in
     3919+0 records out
     4110227968 bytes (4.1 GB) copied, 557.438 s, 7.4 MB/s
     ```
7. **Partition the USB Stick**:
   - Partition the USB stick using `fdisk /dev/sda`.
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# fdisk /dev/sda
     Device contains neither a valid DOS partition table, nor Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
     Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0x66b7eb5d.
     Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
     After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.
     Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)
     ```
   - Create a primary partition: `n`, `p`, `1`, `{ENTER}`, `{ENTER}`
   - Activate the partition as bootable: `a`, `1`
8. **Create XFS File System**:
   - Create an XFS file system on the first partition: `mkfs.xfs /dev/sda1`
   - Create a mount point: `mkdir /mnt/sda1`
   - Mount the partition: `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1`
9. **Copy DAVIX Files**:
   - Copy the `boot` and `slax` directories to the USB stick.
     ```bash
     cp -pvR /mnt/live/mnt/hdc/boot /mnt/live/mnt/hdc/slax /mnt/sda1
     ```
   - This process may take some time, so feel free to take a break.
10. **Make the USB Stick Bootable**:
    - Change to the `boot` directory on the USB stick: `cd /mnt/sda1/boot`
    - Execute `./liloinst.sh` and follow the prompts. The USB stick is now bootable.
11. **Reboot and Test**:
    - Reboot your system and boot from the USB stick. When you see the DAVIX boot menu, the installation is complete.

### 6.4. Hard Drive Installation

DAVIX can also be installed on a hard drive, where all SLAX modules are extracted. These instructions are based in part on the paper published by Offensive Security.

#### Important Note
According to BackTrack, the BackTrack Installer is experimental and has not yet been fully tested. It is highly recommended to use an empty hard drive or a virtual machine (e.g., VMware) for testing.

#### Installation Procedure

1. **Boot DAVIX**:
   - Boot DAVIX from the CD or DVD in KDE mode. Ensure no other hard drives are connected except the one you want to install DAVIX on.
2. **Identify the Hard Drive**:
   - Use the `sfdisk --list` command to identify the device ID of your hard drive. For this example, we assume it is `/dev/hda`.
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# sfdisk --list
     Disk /dev/hda: 9733 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors/track
     Units = cylinders of 8225280 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, counting from 0
        Device Boot Start     End   #cyls    #blocks   Id  System
     /dev/hda1          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     /dev/hda2          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     /dev/hda3          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     /dev/hda4          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
     ```
3. **Partition the Hard Drive**:
   - Partition the hard drive using `fdisk /dev/hda`.
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# fdisk /dev/hda
     The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 9733.
     There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
     and could in certain setups cause problems with:
     1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
     2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
        (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
     ```
   - Create the first partition: `n`, `p`, `1`, `{ENTER}`, `+50M`
   - Create the second partition: `n`, `p`, `2`, `{ENTER}`, `+512M`
   - Create the third partition: `n`, `p`, `3`, `{ENTER}`, `{ENTER}`
   - Activate the first partition as bootable: `a`, `1`
   - Change the partition type of the second partition to 82 for Linux Swap: `t`, `2`, `82`
   - Write the partition table to disk: `w`
4. **Initialize the Swap Partition**:
   - Initialize the swap partition: `mkswap /dev/hda2`
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# mkswap /dev/hda2
     Setting up swapspace version 1, size = 518184 kB
     no label, UUID=4964f425-7308-4f41-bc1a-b7b6c2ff4a3c
     ```
5. **Create Ext3 File Systems**:
   - Create an ext3 file system on the first partition: `mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1`
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda1
     mke2fs 1.40.8 (13-Mar-2008)
     Filesystem label=
     OS type: Linux

     This filesystem will be automatically checked every 24 mounts or
     180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.
     ```
   - Create an ext3 file system on the third partition: `mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda3`
     ```bash
     root@slax:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/hda3
     mke2fs 1.40.8 (13-Mar-2008)
     Warning: 256-byte inodes not usable on older systems

     This filesystem will be automatically checked every 23 mounts or
     180 days, whichever comes first.  Use tune2fs -c or -i to override.
     ```
6. **Mount the Third Partition**:
   - Create a mount point: `mkdir /mnt/hda3`
   - Mount the third partition: `mount /dev/hda3 /mnt/hda3`
7. **Install DAVIX**:
   - In the KDE start menu, select "System" and then "BackTrack Installer (Experimental)".
   - Configure the BT Installer as follows:
     - **Source (BackTrack CD)**: `/mnt/live/mnt/sda1/slax`
     - **Install BackTrack to**: `/mnt/hda3`
     - **Write New MBR (lilo.mbr) to**: `/dev/hda`
     - **Installation method**: `Real`
     - **Restore Original MBR after lilo**: Unchecked
   - Press the "Install" button.
   - The installation process may take some time, so feel free to take a break.
   - Press the "Close" button when the installation is complete.
8. **Final Steps**:
