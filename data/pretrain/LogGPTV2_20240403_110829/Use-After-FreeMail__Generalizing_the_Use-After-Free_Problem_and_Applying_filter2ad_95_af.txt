A CVE AND DATABASE LEAK STATISTICS
Figure 5 shows how the total number of CVEs and and the number
of use-after-free CVEs evolved over the past 10 years. We can see
that the number of use-after-free CVEs increased, whereas the total
number of CVEs remained at approximately the same level. Figure 6
shows the number of accounts which have been leaked in online
database leaks over the past 10 years. We can see a steep increase
at the end of 2016, due to multiple massive leaks.
B ONLINE SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS
In this section, we provide demographic statistics on the partici-
pants of our online survey user study. Figure 7 compares the dis-
tribution of the participants over continents with the distribution
of internet users over continents. We can see that in our data set
Europe is overrepresented, whereas the other regions are slightly
underrepresented. Figure 8 shows the age distribution of the partic-
ipants. We can see that the group from age 26 to 35 has the most
participants, whereas the group with age 56 and above has the least
participants.
C USER CASE STUDIES
In this section, we provide the 6 user case studies that we summa-
rized in Section 7.2.
C.1 User Case Study #1
The participant had a Yahoo account that expired at an unknown
date due to inactivity. The email address occurs in two database
leaks, the last.fm leak and the Dropbox leak, both from 2012 and
publicly released in 2016. While performing our study, we also re-
ceived emails with job offers revealing specific former job interests
of the participants.
Figure 5: Total CVEs and use-after-free CVEs per year. While
the number of total CVEs slightly varied around the same
level in the past 10 years, the number of use-after-free CVEs
increased significantly.
Figure 6: Accumulated number of accounts in online leaks
over time.
Figure 7: Distribution of participants and internet users over
continents [27].
By using the password recovery functions on a series of websites
we were able to compromise 6 online accounts of the participant.
Together with the study participant, we studied thoroughly what
an attacker could have done. In all cases, the account and password
recovery only took seconds and was in most cases not protected by
any CAPTCHA or anti-bot mechanism.

The participant was
not aware that this might increase his exposure to attackers. Fur-
thermore, the participant did not update the email address in several
online accounts. Yahoo has a 40 days deletion policy [69], hence,
by the end of 2016 the email address became available again. The
email address occurs in several database leaks, including Dropbox,
LinkedIn, Stratfor, and tumblr.
We performed checks against a series of popular websites. For
many services, the participant did not use two-factor authentica-
tion, either because it was opt-in or the website did not support
it at all, allowing us to hijack the corresponding accounts. These
accounts include the Amazon account, the Dropbox account, the
eBay account, but also the account at the national automobile club.
Together with the user we analyzed what an attacker can gain from
these accounts in more detail.
By resetting the DropBox password we were able to see personal
information like full name and phone number, but also all personal
files stored in the DropBox folders. The DropBox account was still
actively used by the study participant to store and archive data of
a registered association. The study participant found this data to
be uncritical and loss of access to the DropBox would merely be a
nuisance.
LinkedIn either deleted the account or the participant had changed
the email address. Hence, no attack on the LinkedIn account was
possible.
Even before recovering the password, eBay already provided us
with 5 digits of the telephone number. The full telephone number,
bank details, and personal information were visible after login. In
eBay it is possible to see all previous orders, conveying possibly
very personal or sensitive information. The study participant said
would be extremely unpleasant if an attacker would see these pre-
vious orders and the attached information. The study participant
also found an attacker being capable of placing new orders to be
unsettling.
Similarly, information could be gained from the Amazon account.
After login, Amazon shows the full telephone number, person de-
tails, as well as partial bank details. Similar as in the case of eBay,
Amazon provides an attacker with full information on all previous
orders, including payment information but also conveying possibly
very personal or sensitive information. Amazon hinders the place-
ment of new orders to new addresses, but we believe an attacker
can find a work-around to still place orders. The study participant
again remarked that such attacks would be very unpleasant and
unsettling.
In the account of the national automobile club we were able to
obtain date of birth, telephone number, full name and address of
the participant, all family members and their corresponding age,
all vehicles registered including information on license plates, and
finally, full bank account details, and credit card information.
While performing this analysis, the study participant already
updated the email address in the tested accounts. Furthermore, we
provided the study participant with the recommendation to review
all other accounts to find references to the outdated email address
and update it. The study participant finally remarked to plan to
re-register the old Yahoo email address to prevent an attacker from
performing this attack, in case any account was forgotten.
Figure 8: Age distribution of the participants (grouped by
years).
The participant protected the current Google account with two-
factor authentication. In this case, Google’s password-reset pro-
cedure requires the knowledge of two factors for password reset.
That is, for instance, answering security questions and using the
recovery email address. If an attacker guesses the answer to a se-
curity question correctly, the attacker would have to file a written
explanation why access to the account was lost. Only after this
step and an additional delay of a few hours or days, Google may
provide the attacker with a password-reset link. Although the Ya-
hoo address was the recovery email address, we believe that the
security questions may prevent an attacker from compromising the
account.
We were able to recover access to the Amazon account by cor-
rectly guessing the postal code, which could be found in other
online accounts. Within the Amazon account, we were able to see
previous orders and further personal details, such as the full postal
address and telephone number.
In the Flipboard account of the participant, we were able to see
reading preferences. Similarly, the last.fm account showed the exact
music tracks the participant listened to in the past. The study par-
ticipant remarked that the compromised account could be used to
cause personal or professional damage. An attacker could spoof the
participant’s usage of last.fm, such as listening to music expressing
dubious political views.
The Apple account (AppleID) was deactivated by the partici-
pant several years ago. Still, we were able to re-enable it and read
personal details that have not been deleted from the account. By
knowing the AppleID, we also gained access to iCloud and iTunes.
Finally, in the Dropbox account of the participant, we were able
to see personal information and information on the last used devices.
More significantly, we found financial information stored in files,
including financial information of a nonprofit association.
While going through the accounts with us, the study participant
already updated the email addresses. We also recommended re-
viewing all other accounts to find references to the outdated email
address and update it. The study participant now plans to keep the
email address we re-registered for some time to prevent an attacker
from performing this attack.
C.2 User Case Study #2
The participant had a Yahoo account until autumn 2016 and deleted
the Yahoo account deliberately, in turn of media reports on Yahoo

The participant had a Hotmail address that expired at an unknown
date due to inactivity. The email address occurs in at least two
database leaks; the Adobe leak and the Dropbox leak.
Through the password-reset function, we were able to get access
to the Adobe account within a few minutes. In the Adobe account,
we were able to see personal information such as address, phone
number, and full name, as well as information on Adobe products
the user downloaded or purchased. We were also able to get access
to the Dropbox account, including access to personal account infor-
mation, but more importantly access to all files stored, including
personal files. Finally, Amazon provided us with two options to
log into the user account, password reset, and a one-time login
code. We found this second variant very dangerous, as it allows
an attacker to stealthily login to the Amazon account and see per-
sonal information and the history of orders. In accordance with
the study participant, we ended the study without actually logging
in to Amazon and Dropbox after the password recovery. As in the
other case studies, our recommendation to the study participant
was to review all accounts to find references to the outdated email
address and update it.
C.4 User Case Study #4
The participant had a Hotmail address that probably expired in 2011
due to inactivity. The email address occurs in at least two database
leaks; the Myspace leak and the Exploit.in combination list.
Through the password-reset function, we were able to gain ac-
cess to the actively used Facebook account. In accordance with the
study participant we ended the case study at this point and ensured
that the participant changes the reference from the expired email
address to new one. We also recommended to review all accounts
to find references to the outdated email address and update these
references.
C.5 User Case Study #5
The participant had a GMX address that expired at an unknown
date due to inactivity. The email address does not appear in any
database leaks. However, we found that it was still referenced in the
Amazon account. We found that by guessing the postal code, we
were able to take over the Amazon account. In accordance with the
study participant, we ended the case study at this point. As in the
other case studies, our recommendation to the study participant
was to review all accounts to find references to the outdated email
address and update it.
C.6 User Case Study #6
The participant had a GMX address that expired at an unknown date
due to inactivity. The email address is contained in several database
leaks, including two commercial gaming platform accounts. We
were able to recover access to both gaming platform accounts,
allowing us to gain personal information. We provided the study
participant with our recommendation to review all accounts and
update any outdated email references.
