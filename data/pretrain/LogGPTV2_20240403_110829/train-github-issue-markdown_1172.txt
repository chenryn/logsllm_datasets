Please consider adding an automation language for Visual Studio Code, so that
common operations, such as installing many extensions, performing search &
replaces, opening folders / files, Git operations, etc. can be streamlined.
Not a priority, but certainly something that would be helpful and make VSCode
much more powerful.
