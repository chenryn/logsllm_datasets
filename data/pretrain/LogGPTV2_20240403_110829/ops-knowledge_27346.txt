User:  Answer the following questions What is the Oracle ADG schema
Assistant: Oracle ADG (Active Data Guard) mode is a high-availability solution for Oracle databases. It uses physical replication technology to create a real-time mirror image on a remote standby database to achieve real-time data protection and fast recovery. In ADG mode, the primary and standby databases can run concurrently, and applications can read data in the standby database, thereby improving data availability and reliability. In addition, the ADG mode also provides automatic failover and automatic switching functions, which can automatically switch to the standby database when the primary database fails, providing uninterrupted database services.
