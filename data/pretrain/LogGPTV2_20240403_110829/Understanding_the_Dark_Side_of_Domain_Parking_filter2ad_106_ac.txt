### DNTX Geo-Location and Platform Targeting

DNTX provided only country-level geolocation data and categorized mobile and tablet platforms, including iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and others. For our campaigns, we targeted the specific country from which our crawlers were operating, as well as the BlackBerry platform.

### Advertising and Traffic Campaigns

We executed advertising and traffic campaigns through 15 different ad and traffic networks starting from November 22nd of the previous year, with a total expenditure of $2,260. The logistics of our end-node infiltration campaigns are summarized in Table 3. Notably, our two campaigns with Admanage were terminated after just two days, and our account was locked for nearly a month without any explanation. Additionally, our campaign with Approved Search did not receive any traffic that matched our targeting criteria.

### Infiltrating Start Nodes

To infiltrate start nodes, we focused on the top 10 most popular parking services identified from our sample dataset (Section 3.1). We opened accounts with these services and carefully selected monetization options to maximize the likelihood of observing illicit activities.

#### Parking Service Registration

Among the services we tried, Domain Power required real identity information, which we bypassed, and trafficZ declined our application due to the low volume of traffic our domains received. Other parking services performed various forms of authentication, such as sending a PIN number to a valid phone number and verifying the consistency between the owner information in our domain's WHOIS records and our application. We successfully passed these checks and registered with 7 parking services using fake identities, as detailed in Table 4. Most of these services are indeed popular, as shown in Table 1.

| # | Parking Service | # Parked Domains |
|---|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | PS5             | 9                |
| 2 | PS2             | 2                |
| 3 | PS6             | 6                |
| 4 | PS1             | 4                |
| 5 | PS4             | 3                |
| 6 | Rook Media      | 2                |
| 7 | PS7             | 2                |

**Table 4: Parking Infiltration Logistics**

Note: The total number of domains does not add up to 23 due to some domains being moved between parking services. PS7 is not listed in Table 1 as it is not among the top 10 parking services.

#### Domain Monetization

We purchased 23 domains under various top-level domains and parked them with the 7 services. The domain names were chosen to match the keywords targeted in our campaigns (see Table 2). We set their NS records to point to those of their corresponding parking services, with a few exceptions discussed later.

Our preliminary analysis of data crawled from parking services showed that suspicious activities were primarily observed in redirection chains. Therefore, we avoided situations like PPC listings, where a set of PPC ads are displayed on a parking landing page. Instead, we chose not to have such a page (displaying signs like "for sale"), so the parking services could monetize the traffic our domains received through redirections. One parking service, Bodis, allowed us to explicitly set this monetization option by redirecting traffic instead of setting the NS record to Bodis. For example, we parked the domain `news-network.biz` with Bodis by using the GoDaddy forwarding service to send our domain traffic to `http://bodisparking.com/news-network.biz`.

### Findings

Through infiltrating the start and end nodes of the ecosystem and crawling domains hosted by popular parking services, we collected 1,015 monetization chains linking our crawlers to our end nodes (our advertising or traffic purchase websites), sometimes through our start nodes (parked domains). Using these chains as ground truth, we confirmed the presence of illicit activities during parked domain monetization, including click fraud, traffic spam, and traffic stealing, as detailed below.

#### Click Fraud

Out of all the ad clicks delivered to our advertising websites through parking services, 709 were found to come from our own crawlers. These clicks are clearly fraudulent since our crawlers were designed not to click on any ads (Section 2.3). Table 3 details the number of clicks received from our crawler through each ad network.

#### Traffic Spam

The four traffic purchasing campaigns we launched received 306 traffic hits from our crawler through domains parked with parking services. Upon examining the parked domains that served as the start nodes on these monetization chains, we found that 83 of them were entirely unrelated to the keywords we purchased from the direct traffic systems. Table 5 provides examples of spam and good-quality traffic.

| Spam Examples | Keyword | Good-Quality Examples |

| 19jj.com, ib2c.com.cn | Music | 70263.com, facebooki.pl |

#### Traffic Stealing

Occasionally, parking services were found to be dishonest with domain owners, failing to inform them of part of the revenue they were supposed to share. Specifically, we cross-examined the revenues of the domains under our control and the billing reports for the ad/traffic campaigns we launched. This revealed that some monetization chains going through our parked domains were not reported to us (domain owners) but charged to our campaign accounts.

For example, we confirmed the existence of traffic stealing from monetization chains captured by our crawler connecting three of our domains (parked with PS5) and our PPR campaign with 7Search. This was achieved by comparing the billing reports provided by 7Search, the parked domains' revenue reports provided by the parking service, and the related monetization chains with the right combination of timestamp, source IP address, referral domain, and keyword.

In December 2013, we, as a campaign owner, were billed for 23 traffic hits by 7Search (see Figure 6(b) in Appendix), but nothing was reported by the parking service (see Figure 6(a) in Appendix). Table 6 shows the breakdown of the crawlers' traffic. Clearly, the parking services kept the rightful share away from us as the owners of the parked domains. Note that not all requests from our crawler were billed by 7Search because they limit the traffic hits by one IP address and a valid visiting period (our campaign was set to run between 12 AM-6 AM and 10 PM-11:59 PM). Additionally, we found other monetization chains, captured by our crawler and monetized by the same parking service through other ad networks such as Advertise, that have not been reported on our parked domains' revenue reports.

### Fingerprinting Monetization Chains

Through the infiltration study, we confirmed the presence of illicit activities in the monetization of parked domains. However, the pervasiveness and impact of these activities remain unclear. Understanding this issue cannot rely solely on the 1,015 seed chains (reported in Table 3) whose traffic sources and end nodes were under our control. To identify illicit operations on other monetization chains, particularly those blue and green ones in Figure 3, which do not connect to our ad/traffic campaigns, we developed a technique that fingerprints the monetization options observed on our seed chains. These fingerprints, which we call stamps, were used to "expand" the seed set, capturing the illicit activities on other monetization chains collected by our crawlers over months.

#### Methodology

The idea is to detect illegitimate operations by identifying the monetization options involved. Specifically, once we know how a parking service monetizes a visit from our crawler, we can determine whether a fraudulent activity occurred. For PPC, a fraudulent click is evident if our crawler never clicked; for PPR, we check the consistency between the keywords expected by the end nodes and the names of the parked domains the traffic went through (see Section 5 for details).

Even though the monetization options might not be evident on a chain, we know that it must go through a corresponding monetization party (ad networks, traffic systems, etc.) before the traffic reaches the end node. This is necessary for accounting purposes. For example, if a click has not been sent to a PPC ad network, the ad network will not be able to pay its publisher or bill its advertiser. The last few URLs leading to the end node are also clearly related to the monetization party.

For instance, consider a monetization chain captured by our crawler in Table 7, initiated by a visit to a domain parked with PS1 and ending at our advertiser site. Looking backward from our URL along the chain, we see two URLs from `fastonlinefinder.com`, a search website affiliated with the Advertise ad network. Comparing this path with other chains through the same ad network, a unique pattern emerges: the last two URLs before the end node are always similar, and even though the search websites vary, the remaining part mostly stays consistent.

| Parked Domain | Crawler Hits | Traffic Reported by Parking Service | Billed by 7Search |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|

| Real-jobs.info | 23 | 0 | 5 |

This method allows us to expand our seed set and capture the illicit activities on other monetization chains, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem.
