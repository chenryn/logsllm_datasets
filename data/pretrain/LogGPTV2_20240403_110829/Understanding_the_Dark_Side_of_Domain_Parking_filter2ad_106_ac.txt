tem DNTX provided only country-level geo-location and
the platforms (iOS, Android, BlackBerry and others) un-
der its mobile/tablet category. In this case, we targeted
our campaigns at the country our crawlers were running
from and the Blackberry platforms.
Overall, we ran advertising and trafﬁc campaigns
through all 15 ad and trafﬁc networks starting from Nov.
22nd last year, which cost us $2,260 in total. The lo-
gistics of our end node inﬁltration campaigns are sum-
marized in Table 3. Among those campaigns, the two
with Admanage lasted for only two days before we were
locked out from our account for almost a month with-
out giving any explanations. Also, our campaign with
Approved Search did not receive any trafﬁc that ﬁt
our targeting criteria.
Inﬁltrating Start Nodes
3.2
To inﬁltrate start nodes, we went through top 10 most
popular parking services identiﬁed from our sample
dataset (Section 3.1), opened accounts with them and
carefully chose our monetization options so as to max-
imize the chance of observing illicit activities.
Parking service registration. Among all the services
we tried, Domain Power asked for real identity infor-
mation, which we skipped, and trafficZ turned down
our application, citing the small volume of trafﬁc our do-
mains received. Other parking services performed some
type of authentication, such as sending a PIN number to
a valid phone number, and verifying the consistency be-
tween the owner information on our domains’ whois
records and that on our application. We passed those
checks and used fake identities to register with 7 parking

ber of domains does not add up to 23 which is due to moving
some domains between parking services. Note that PS7 is not
shown in Table 1 as it is not in the top 10 parking services.
Domain monetization. We purchased 23 domains un-
der a number of top level domains and parked them with
the 7 services. The names of those domains were care-
fully chosen to match the keywords we targeted in our
campaigns (see Table 2). We also set their NS records
to point to those of their corresponding parking services,
with some exceptions discussed later.
Our preliminary analysis on data crawled from park-
ing services showed that suspicious activities were only
observed on redirection chains. Therefore, we tried to
avoid situations like PPC listings, where a set of PPC
ads are displayed on a parking landing page.
Instead,
we chose not to have such a page (displaying signs like
“for sale”), so the parking services can monetize the traf-
ﬁc our domains received through redirections. Actu-
ally, one parking service, Bodis, allowed us to explic-
itly set this monetization option by redirecting the trafﬁc
instead of setting the NS record to Bodis. For exam-
ple, we parked the domain news-network.biz with
Bodis by using the GoDaddy forwarding service to
send our domain trafﬁc to http://bodisparking.
com/news-network.biz.
3.3 Findings
Through inﬁltrating the start and end nodes of the
ecosystem and crawling domains hosted by popular
parking services, we were able to collect 1,015 mone-
tization chains that link our crawlers to our end nodes
(our advertising or trafﬁc purchase websites), sometimes
through our start nodes (parked domains). Using those
chains as the ground truth, we conﬁrmed the presence of
illicit activities during parked domain monetization, in-
cluding click fraud, trafﬁc spam and trafﬁc stealing, as
elaborated below.
Click fraud. Out of all the ad clicks delivered to our
advertising websites through parking services, 709 were
found to come from our own crawlers. They are clearly
fraudulent since our crawlers were designed not to click
on any ad (Section 2.3). Table 3 details the number of
clicks received from our crawler through each ad net-
work.
Trafﬁc spam.
The 4 trafﬁc purchasing campaigns
we launched received 306 trafﬁc hits from our crawler
through domains parked with parking services. Upon
examining the parked domains that served as the start
nodes on those monetization chains, we found that 83
of them were totally unrelated to the keywords we pur-
chased from the direct trafﬁc systems. Table 5 provides
examples of spam and good-quality trafﬁc.

Trafﬁc stealing. Occasionally, parking services were
found to be dishonest with domain owners, failing to
inform them for part of the revenue they were sup-
posed to share with the owners. Speciﬁcally, we cross-
examined the revenues of the domains under our control
and the billing reports for the ad/trafﬁc campaigns we
launched. This revealed that some monetization chains
going through our parked domains were not reported to
us (domain owners) but charged to our campaign ac-
counts.
For example, we conﬁrmed the existence of traf-
ﬁc stealing from monetization chains captured by our
crawler connecting three of our domains (parked with
PS5) and our PPR campaign with 7Search. This was
achieved through comparing the billing reports provided
by 7Search, the parked domains’ revenue reports pro-
vided by the parking service and the related monetization
chains with the right combination of time stamp, source
IP address, referral domain and keyword.
It turns out
that we, as a campaign owner, were billed for 23 traf-
ﬁc hits by 7Search (see Figure 6(b) in Appendix) but
nothing was reported by the parking service (see Fig-
ure 6(a) in Appendix) in December 2013. We show the
breakdown of the crawlers’ trafﬁc in Table 6. Clearly,
the parking services kept the rightful share away from us
as the owners of the parked domains. Note that not all
requests from our crawler were billed by 7Search be-
cause they limit the trafﬁc hits by one IP address and
a valid visiting period (our campaign was set to run
between 12AM-6AM and 10PM-11:59PM ). Addition-
ally, we found other monetization chains, captured by
our crawler and monetized by the same parking service
through other ad networks such as Advertise that
have not been reported on our parked domains’ revenue
reports.

4 Fingerprinting Monetization Chains
Through the inﬁltration study, we conﬁrmed the pres-
ence of illicit activities in the monetization of parked do-
mains. What is less clear, however, is the pervasiveness
and impact of those activities. Understanding of this is-
sue cannot rely on the 1,015 seed chains (reported in Ta-
ble 3) whose trafﬁc sources and end nodes were under
our control. We need to identify the illicit operations oc-
curring on other monetization chains, particularly those
blue and green ones in Figure 3, which do not connect
to our ad/trafﬁc campaigns. To this end, we developed a
technique that ﬁngerprints the monetization options ob-
served on our seed chains. These ﬁngerprints, which we
call stamps, were used to “expand” the seed set, captur-
ing the illicit activities on other monetization chains col-
lected by our crawlers over months.
4.1 Methodology
The idea. As discussed above, the problem of detecting
illegitimate operations, which we did not have a direct
observation of, comes down to identifying the monetiza-
tion options they involve. More speciﬁcally, as soon as
we know exactly how a parking service monetizes a visit
from our crawler, we can immediately ﬁnd out whether
a fraudulent activity occurred: clearly, the PPC option
is a fraudulent click, as our crawler never clicked; when
it comes to PPR, we check the consistency between the
keywords expected by the end nodes and the names of the
parked domains the trafﬁc went through (see Section 5
for details). Therefore, the question here becomes how
to determine which options have been used in a given
monetization chain.
Actually, even though those options might not be ev-
ident on a monetization chain, we know that it must
go through a corresponding monetization party (ad net-
works, trafﬁc systems, etc.) before the trafﬁc gets to the
end node. This needs to happen for accounting purposes:
for example, if a click has not been sent to a PPC ad
network, the ad network never knows about it and there-
fore will not be able to pay its publisher or bill its ad-
vertiser. Also, the last few URLs leading to the end node
are clearly related to the monetization party. As an exam-
ple, let us look at a monetization chain captured by our
crawler in Table 7, which was initiated by a visit to a do-
main parked with PS1 and ended at our advertiser site.
Looking backward from our URL along the chain, we
can see two URLs from fastonlinefinder.com,
a search website. The site turns out to be afﬁliated
with the Advertise ad network.
Interestingly, once
we compare this path with other chains also through the
same ad network, it becomes quite clear that they carry
a unique pattern: ﬁrst, right before the end node, the
last two URLs are always similar; second, for these two
URLs, even though they vary across different chains in
terms of search websites, the remaining part mostly stays
