User: I have a simple python script I can run through terminal. Is there a way to put a shortcut on my mac desktop to open terminal and run like "cd ~/Desktop/script.py"? I have tried automator but i couldn't get it to work
Assistant: Create a file called anyname.command with python ~/Desktop/script.py in it. Then make it executable by running chmod 555 ~/Desktop/anyname.command in terminal.  Then when you double-click on anyname.command it should run the python script.
