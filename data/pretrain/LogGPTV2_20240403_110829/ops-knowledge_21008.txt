User: is there a way to programmatically list log-files created per rule from within the Snakefile? Will I have to tap into the DAG and if yes, how?
Background: I'd like to bundle up and remove all created log-files (only cluster logs are in a separate folder; some output files have correspondingly called log files). For this I want to be specific and exclude log files that might have been created by run programs and that coincidentally match a log glob.
Are there alternatives, e.g. would parsing shellcmd_tracking files be easier?
Thanks,
Andreas
Assistant: With the upcoming release 3.9.0, you can see the corresponding log files for all output files when invoking snakemake --summary.
