## Abstract

Keystroke dynamics is the process of identifying individual users based on their typing rhythms, which are derived from the timestamps of key-press and key-release events. Many researchers have explored this domain with mixed results, but few have examined the specific case of digit-only input, such as using a single finger on a number pad. This scenario might be relevant for automated teller machines, mobile phones, or building security systems.

In this study, 28 users typed the same 10-digit number using only their right-hand index finger. Using statistical and machine-learning techniques (random forest), we achieved an unweighted correct-detection rate of 99.97% with a corresponding false-alarm rate of 1.51%, using practiced 2-of-3 ensemble typing with outlier handling. This level of accuracy approaches that of passwords or PINs for two-factor authentication.

## Introduction

The idea of using keystroke dynamics to identify individuals dates back to the late 19th century when Bryan and Harter [7] observed that telegraph operators could be identified by their unique "fists" or tapping styles. Just as the telegraph key served as a common input device in those days, keyboards, mice, joysticks, and other pointing devices are now common input mediums. If keystroke behaviors can be distinguished, they could serve as a form of continuous or re-authentication, making users accountable for their actions.

Many studies have investigated keystroke dynamics, often using data from real-world environments. However, these studies have been influenced by various confounding factors, making it difficult to attribute outcomes solely to user behavior. This paper aims to use tightly-controlled experiments to isolate and study the simplest possible form of keystroke dynamics, focusing on numeric input using a single finger on a number pad.

## Background and Related Work

### Keystroke Dynamics on Full Keyboards

Keystroke dynamics involves measuring and assessing a user's typing style based on timing latencies between keystrokes. These measures are compared to a user profile to classify whether the user is authenticated or not. The field was arguably born in 1980 with a report from RAND, demonstrating that typing rhythms could plausibly be used to authenticate users [16].

Over the next two decades, many researchers investigated various aspects of keystroke dynamics, including different features (e.g., key-hold times, digram latencies), classifiers (e.g., neural nets, support-vector machines), and stimuli (e.g., passwords, paragraphs). These studies generally used full QWERTY keyboards, providing a rich and complex environment for success. However, this complexity also makes it challenging to isolate the key factors in discriminating among typists.

### Keystroke Dynamics on Number Pads

To explore a simpler environment, we restricted our study to the digits 0-9, using only the number pad on the right end of most full-sized keyboards. This simplification limits the fingers used to just the index finger, similar to how people input PINs into ATMs or security codes into numeric keypads.

### Previous Studies on Number Pads

- **Clarke and Furnell [11, 13]**: Asked 30 subjects to enter 30 repetitions each for a 4-digit PIN and an 11-digit phone number using a numbers-only keyboard. They achieved an equal-error rate (EER) of 8% for the 4-digit PIN and 9% for the 11-digit phone number.
- **Rodrigues and colleagues [27]**: Asked 20 subjects to type a pre-assigned 8-digit passcode into a specially instrumented mobile phone. Using interkeystroke latencies as inputs to a neural network, they achieved an EER of 8%.
- **Clarke et al. [12]**: Asked 32 subjects to enter 4-digit numerical passcodes. A separate group of impostors tried to break in. Using a hidden Markov model with four types of features, they achieved varying EERs for different combinations of passcodes.

These studies demonstrate the potential of keystroke dynamics on number pads, but further research is needed to refine and validate these methods in more controlled and realistic settings.
