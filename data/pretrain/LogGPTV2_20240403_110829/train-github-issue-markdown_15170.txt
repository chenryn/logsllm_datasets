The Button's ripple effect used to open a modal remains "pulsing" if I close
it using the "esc" key.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Ripple effect should disappear after the modal is closed.
## Current Behavior
Ripple effect remains
