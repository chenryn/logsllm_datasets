Why This Talk?
● Lots of bold claims concerning the 
feasibility of cyber-hijacking 
● Bold claims get lots of press
● Most people don't know enough to 
evaluate these claims
● Whether you feel safer or even more 
scared should be based on facts

What you will learn
● How some of the common aircraft systems really 
work, including:
– ADS-B
– ADS-A
– ACARS
– Transponders
– Collision avoidance
– GPS
– Autopilots
– Avionics buses and networks
– Attacks being presented by others
Some commonly discussed 
attacks
● Hacking into the avionics via the 
entertainment network
● Hacking ADS-B
● Hacking engine systems
● Hacking ACARS
Let's get this out of the way to 
start
● You cannot override the pilot
● All aircraft feature unhackable 
mechanical backup instruments
● You can affect the autopilot operation
– If pilot(s) notice they will disconnect
– Anything you attempt will likely result in 
alerts
Attacking avionics networks
● Older aircraft use ARINC 429 networks
– Not connected to anything useful
– Require specialized hardware
● Newer aircraft use a modified version of 
Ethernet known as ARINC 664 or AFDX
ARINC 664 and AFDX
● Built on Ethernet, but...
– Can't just start sending packets
– Never wireless
– Some security in place
● Not connected to entertainment system
● Not connected to in-flight wifi
Meet ARINC 664 aka AFDX
● Based on ARINC 629
– First created by Boeing for 777
● Allows the use of common off the shelf 
(COTS) components vs ARINC 429 
which is proprietary
● Built on Ethernet, but not the same
– Uses redundant channels
– Assigns time slices to avoid collisions 
and make it deterministic
ARINC 664 Virtual Links
● Unidirectional logical pipe
● 1 and only 1 sender
● 1 or more receiver
● Timeslicing is used to avoid collisions
– Bandwidth Allocation Gap (BAG) determines 
size of timeslice
– Jitter (max latency – min latency) determined 
by number of VL and BAG
AFDX Connections
ARINC 664 in real life
Tight Integration with ARINC 
664
Entertainment Systems
● Connected to output ports on GPS and 
FMS or through a Network Extension 
Device (NED)
● Never connected to ARINC 
429/629/664
● Remember that the avionics network is 
never wireless and not compatible with 
your friendly TCP/IP
In-flight Entertainment
Boeing 777 Confusion
● Boeing asked for a special condition to 
allow the passenger information 
network to be connected to other 
networks such as the aircraft 
information network
● FAA granted this special condition on 
11/18/13 provided that a network 
extension device (NED) was used and 
certain conditions were met
777 Confusion (contd)
FAA specified:
● The applicant must ensure that the design 
provides isolation from, or airplane electronic 
system security protection against, access by 
unauthorized sources internal to the airplane. 
The design must prevent inadvertent and 
malicious changes to, and all adverse impacts 
upon, airplane equipment, systems, networks, 
or other assets required for safe flight and 
operations.
Meet NED the Network 
Extension Device
● Essentially a gateway that goes 
between ARINC 429/629/664 and IP
● Like any gateway each path must be 
programmed
● FMS does not receive input from NED
– Cannot send bogus commands to FMS
– If NED is compromised may be possible 
to impersonate another device
Example NED implementation

MH370?
● A Boeing 777
● Uses ARINC 629
– Not 664 we've been discussing
– Really not Ethernet
● The 777 is essentially the only plane to 
use ARINC 629
– Harder to hack than ARINC 664

Sorry, we really tried to put a 
schematic on this slide, but 
couldn't get approval from 
manufacturers 
Hacking In-flight Wireless
Attacking ADS-B/ADS-A
● Can create phantom aircraft
● No security in protocol
● Could create fake weather reports
● Could be jammed
● Not likely to affect TCAS
ADS-B (broadcast)
● Piloted in Alaska
● Intended to improve flying where RADAR 
coverage is limited
● Part of a Free Flight system planned for the 
future
● Provides traffic and weather where available
● Used by small planes to broadcast position 
information
ADS-A (addressable)
● What the airlines use (contrary to what you may have 
heard)
● Related to ACARS
● ADS-B == cable-ready TV
● ADS-A == addressable cable box with pay-per-view, 
etc
– Allows specific airplanes to send/receive messages
– Allows lower separation outside of RADAR 
coverage (FANS)
– Airliners use neither ADS-B or ADS-A for collision 
avoidance
– Can be VHF, HF, or Satellite based
Collision Avoidance
● TIS-B
– Provided by ATC
– Requires a mode S 
transponder (ADS-B in)
– Only available in some areas
– Not authoritative
– Does not use ADS-B signals
– ATC does not automatically 
relay every ADS-B signal they 
receive
Collision Avoidance (contd)
● TCAD
– Used in small planes
– Provides information
– Not authoritative
● TCAS 
– What the big boys (biz jet and up) use
TCAS
● Uses transponders in the area
● Can actively interrogate other 
transponders
● Authoritative
● Pilot can use even if other aircraft not in 
sight
Transponders
● Supplement primary RADAR
● Mode S used in ADS-B
● Airliners have at least 2
● Signals are used for collision avoidance
Attacking ADS-B
Attacking engine systems
● Engine monitors are output only
– Information is recorded for maintenance
– Some information may be sent via 
ACARS to airline and/or manufacturer
● Some engine control systems are 
electronic
– All have purely mechanical backup
– Most only trim mechanical system 
electronically
ACARS
● Can be used to send 
messages to/from ground
● Messages to/from people or 
systems
● Used for
– Weather
– Delays
– Updated flight plans
– Maintenance information
Attacking ACARS
● Could create a bogus flight plan update
● Could create bogus weather
● Hypothetically could create fake 
messages from plane to ground
● Not a practical way to take over an 
airplane
ACARS Attack
Closing Thoughts
● Nearly every protocol used in aviation is 
unsecured
● There is certainly the potential to annoy 
ATC and/or small aircraft
● Increasing automation while continuing 
with unsecured protocols is problematic
● Airliners are relatively safe (for now)
