## Why This Talk?
- Bold claims about the feasibility of cyber-hijacking are prevalent.
- These claims often receive significant media attention.
- Most people lack the technical knowledge to evaluate these claims.
- Understanding the facts is crucial for assessing the safety of air travel.

## What You Will Learn
- How common aircraft systems work, including:
  - ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast)
  - ADS-A (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Addressable)
  - ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System)
  - Transponders
  - Collision avoidance systems
  - GPS
  - Autopilots
  - Avionics buses and networks
  - Commonly discussed attacks on these systems

## Commonly Discussed Attacks
- Hacking into the avionics via the entertainment network
- Hacking ADS-B
- Hacking engine systems
- Hacking ACARS

## Key Points to Note
- Pilots cannot be overridden by cyber-attacks.
- All aircraft have mechanical backup instruments that are not hackable.
- The autopilot can be affected, but any such attempts will likely trigger alerts and prompt the pilot to disconnect the system.

## Attacking Avionics Networks
- **Older Aircraft (ARINC 429)**
  - Not connected to useful systems
  - Requires specialized hardware
- **Newer Aircraft (ARINC 664/AFDX)**
  - Based on Ethernet but with specific security measures
  - Not wireless and not connected to in-flight Wi-Fi or entertainment systems

### ARINC 664 (AFDX)
- **Features:**
  - Redundant channels
  - Deterministic timeslicing to avoid collisions
  - Unidirectional logical pipes (Virtual Links)
  - Bandwidth Allocation Gap (BAG) and jitter management

### Entertainment Systems
- Connected to output ports on GPS and FMS or through a Network Extension Device (NED)
- Never connected to ARINC 429/629/664
- Avionics networks are not wireless and not compatible with TCP/IP

### Boeing 777 Special Condition
- Boeing requested a special condition to connect the passenger information network to the aircraft information network.
- FAA granted this condition with strict isolation and security requirements, using a Network Extension Device (NED).

### MH370
- A Boeing 777 using ARINC 629, which is more secure than ARINC 664.
- ARINC 629 is unique to the 777 and is harder to hack.

### In-Flight Wireless and ADS-B/ADS-A
- **ADS-B:**
  - Can create phantom aircraft
  - No security in the protocol
  - Could create fake weather reports
  - Could be jammed
  - Used in Alaska for improved flying in areas with limited radar coverage
- **ADS-A:**
  - Used by airlines
  - Related to ACARS
  - Allows specific airplanes to send/receive messages
  - Enables lower separation outside of radar coverage (FANS)

### Collision Avoidance
- **TIS-B (Traffic Information Service–Broadcast):**
  - Provided by ATC
  - Requires a Mode S transponder
  - Not authoritative
- **TCAD (Traffic Collision Avoidance Device):**
  - Used in small planes
  - Provides information but is not authoritative
- **TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System):**
  - Used in larger aircraft
  - Actively interrogates other transponders
  - Authoritative and used even if other aircraft are not in sight

### Engine Systems and ACARS
- **Engine Monitors:**
  - Output only, used for maintenance
  - Some control systems are electronic but have mechanical backups
- **ACARS:**
  - Used for communication between the aircraft and ground
  - Can send and receive messages related to weather, delays, flight plans, and maintenance
  - Potential for creating bogus messages, but not a practical way to take over an airplane

## Closing Thoughts
- Many aviation protocols are unsecured.
- There is potential to disrupt ATC and small aircraft.
- Increasing automation without securing protocols is problematic.
- Airliners are relatively safe, but vigilance is necessary.
