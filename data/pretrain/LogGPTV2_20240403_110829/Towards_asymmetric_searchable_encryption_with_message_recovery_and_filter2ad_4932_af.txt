Let this distinguishing problem be denoted as I5.
It is easy to see that I5 can be reduced to the distinguish-
ing problem D2 deﬁned at Reduction step 2a. in the proof
of Theorem 2 (based on a D2’s instance, by adding either
H2(w0) or H2(w1), we can obtain an I5’s instance). There-
fore, from the proof of Theorem 2, a P.P.T. attacker can
only have a negligible advantage in solving I5 based on the
DLIN assumption. As a result, ǫ0 is negligible based on all
the assumptions mentioned in the theorem.

Note that this theorem implies that the proposed scheme
is also secure under Deﬁnition 5.
The following theorem is straightforward, so that we skip
a formal proof.
Theorem 5. The proposed scheme achieves universal trap-
door one-wayness under Deﬁnition 6, given: (1) the hash
function H2 is one-way; (2) the bilinear map ˆe is one-way.
Theorem 6. The proposed scheme achieves trapdoor in-
distinguishability property if (KeyGen′, Encrypt′, Decrypt′) and
(Enc, Dec) are IND-CPA secure.
Proof. Under Deﬁnition 7, according to the attack game
deﬁnition in Figure 5, the attacker can query sKeyReqt′ for
t′ = 1 or t′ = h. Without loss of generality, we assume that
the attacker queries sKeyReq1. This means t = h, and the
challenge twb = (v7, v8) are deﬁned as follows.
y ∈R Zp, v0 = H2(wb)x1y, v1 = H2(wb)x1 , v2 = ˆe(gx1y

v3 = gx1y

, v5 = H2(wb), k1 ∈R M,
v7 = Enc(v0||v1||v2||v3||v4||v5, k1), v8 = Encrypt′(k1, P Ksh ).
Note the fact that revealing the receiver’s private key x1, x2
will not aﬀect the security of the encryption schemes, namely
(KeyGen′, Encrypt′, Decrypt′) and (Enc, Dec). Without oracle
access to SKsh , the attacker can learn nothing about wb
from twb . Then, the theorem follows.
5. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have formulated the concept of ASE††
and attempted to provide a comprehensive security model
for the primitive. As to the relationships of various secu-
rity properties, the IND-CPA security against an outside at-
tacker is implied by the ciphertext indistinguishability prop-
erty against a Type-I server and the message-dependent
trapdoor indistinguishability property (to be presented in
the full paper due to space limit). Compared with pre-
vious works, such as those from [7, 8, 9], our formulation
deﬁnes more ﬂexible functionalities and our security model
reﬂects a higher level of security guarantees. The security
of the proposed instantiation relies on the standard DLIN
and BDH assumptions in the random oracle model, which
plays an important role in the double encryption structure.
It is an interesting future work to investigate an instantia-
tion in the standard model, namely without using random
oracle. With regard to trapdoor security, we have designed
universal one-wayness property against all attackers. There
is a possibility of replacing it with the augmented notion
proposed in [2] or an even stronger notion similar to the
ciphertext indistinguishability property against Type-II at-
tacker in our security model. We consider this to be another
line of future work.
