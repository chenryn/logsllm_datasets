### Reduction Step 4b
Let \( Y'_0 \) and \( Y'_1 \) be defined as follows. It is straightforward to see that **Claim 2** (stated and proven below) also implies that, for any probabilistic polynomial-time (PPT) attacker, given \( Y'_1 \), it can only compute \( \hat{e}(g^{x_1}_1, h^{r_1}_1 \cdot h) \) with a negligible probability based on the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption.

- \( Y'_0 = (x_1, g_1, g_2, g^{x_1}_1, h^{r_1}_1 \cdot h, g^{r'_1}_1, g^{r'_2}_2, g^{x_2 r'_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1) \)
- \( Y'_1 = (x_1, g_1, g_2, g^{x_1}_1, h^{r_1}_1 \cdot h, g^{r'_1}_1, g^{r'_2}_2, g^{x_2 r'_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{r_1}_1, g^{r_2}_2, g^{x_2 r_2}_2) \)

As a result, the distinguishing problem \( I_2 \) is equivalent to distinguishing \( Y'_1 \) based on the BDH assumption in the random oracle model. Let this distinguishing problem be denoted as \( I_3 \).

### Reduction Step 4c
The problem \( I_3 \) is equivalent to distinguishing \( Z_0 \) and \( Z_1 \), where \( x_2, r_1, r_2, r'_1, r'_2, z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p \) and \( h_0, h_1 \in_R G \). Note that \( x_1 \) and \( g^{x_1} \) are removed.

- \( Z_0 = (g_1, g_2, g^{x_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{x_2 r'_2}_2 \cdot h^{r'_1}_0) \)
- \( Z_1 = (g_1, g_2, g^{x_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{x_2 r'_2}_2 \cdot h^{r'_1}_1) \)

Let this distinguishing problem be denoted as \( I_5 \).

It is easy to see that \( I_5 \) can be reduced to the distinguishing problem \( D_2 \) defined at Reduction step 2a in the proof of Theorem 2. Based on an instance of \( D_2 \), by adding either \( H_2(w_0) \) or \( H_2(w_1) \), we can obtain an instance of \( I_5 \). Therefore, from the proof of Theorem 2, a PPT attacker can only have a negligible advantage in solving \( I_5 \) based on the Decision Linear (DLIN) assumption. As a result, \( \epsilon_0 \) is negligible based on all the assumptions mentioned in the theorem.

### Claim 2
In the proof of Theorem 4, for any PPT attacker, given either \( Y'_0 \) or \( Y'_1 \), it can only compute \( \hat{e}(g^{x_1}_1, h^{r_1}_1 \cdot h) \) with a negligible probability based on the BDH assumption.

#### Proof
Due to symmetry, we only need to prove that, for any PPT attacker, given \( Y'_0 \), it can only compute \( \hat{e}(g^{x_1}_1, h^{r_1}_1 \cdot h) \) with a negligible probability.

**Reduction Step a1:**
Given \( (x_1, g_1, g_2, g^{x_1}_1, g^{r_1}_1, g^{r_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2, h^{r_1}_0) \), we can construct \( Y^*_0 \) as follows, where \( \alpha, \beta \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p \):
\[ Y^*_0 = (x_1, g_1, g_2, g^{x_1}_1, g^{r_1 \alpha + \beta}_1, g^{r_2 \alpha + \beta}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{x_2 r_2 \alpha + \beta}_2, h^{r_1 \alpha + \beta}_0) \]
It is easy to verify that \( Y^*_0 \) has an identical distribution to that of \( Y'_0 \). So, the problem can be reduced to: given \( (x_1, g_1, g_2, g^{x_1}_1, g^{r_1}_1, g^{r_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2, h^{r_1}_0) \), the attacker computes \( \hat{e}(g^{x_1}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2)^{\alpha \cdot g^{x_2 \beta}_2} \).

**Reduction Step a2:**
The above problem can be reduced to: given \( (x_1, g_1, g_2, g^{x_1}_1, g^{r_1}_1, g^{r_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2, h^{r_1}_0) \), the attacker computes \( \hat{e}(g^{x_1}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2) \).

**Reduction Step a3:**
The above problem can be reduced to: given \( (g_1, g_2, g^{x_2}_2, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{r_2}_2, h^{r_1}_0) \), the attacker computes \( \hat{e}(g_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2) \).

**Reduction Step a4:**
This reduced problem is equivalent to: given \( (f^{x_3}_1, f_1, f^{x_2}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2) \), where \( f_1 \in_R G \) and \( x_3 \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p \), the attacker can only compute \( \hat{e}(f^{x_3}_1, f_1) \) with a negligible probability. The equivalence is based on the fact that \( g_1, g^z_1, g^{x_2 z}_1, g^{r_2}_2, h^{r_1}_0 \) are replaced with \( f^{x_3}_1, f_1, f^{x_2}_1, g^{x_2 r_2}_2 \), which is simply a change of notation. Referring to the reduction from \( P_3 \) to \( P_4 \) in the proof of **Claim 1**, this can be reduced to the BDH problem. The claim follows.

### Theorem 5
The proposed scheme achieves universal trapdoor one-wayness under Definition 6, given:
1. The hash function \( H_2 \) is one-way.
2. The bilinear map \( \hat{e} \) is one-way.

### Theorem 6
The proposed scheme achieves trapdoor indistinguishability property if \((\text{KeyGen}', \text{Encrypt}', \text{Decrypt}')\) and \((\text{Enc}, \text{Dec})\) are IND-CPA secure.

#### Proof
Under Definition 7, according to the attack game definition in Figure 5, the attacker can query \( \text{sKeyReqt}' \) for \( t' = 1 \) or \( t' = h \). Without loss of generality, we assume that the attacker queries \( \text{sKeyReq1} \). This means \( t = h \), and the challenge \( \text{twb} = (v_7, v_8) \) are defined as follows:
- \( y \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p \)
- \( v_0 = H_2(w_b)^{x_1 y} \)
- \( v_1 = H_2(w_b)^{x_1} \)
- \( v_2 = \hat{e}(g^{x_1 y}_1, w_b^{-1}) \)
- \( v_3 = g^{x_1 y}_1 \)
- \( v_4 = g^{x_1 x_2 y}_1 \)
- \( v_5 = H_2(w_b) \)
- \( k_1 \in_R M \)
- \( v_7 = \text{Enc}(v_0 || v_1 || v_2 || v_3 || v_4 || v_5, k_1) \)
- \( v_8 = \text{Encrypt}'(k_1, \text{PKsh}) \)

Note that revealing the receiver’s private key \( x_1, x_2 \) will not affect the security of the encryption schemes, namely \((\text{KeyGen}', \text{Encrypt}', \text{Decrypt}')\) and \((\text{Enc}, \text{Dec})\). Without oracle access to \( \text{SKsh} \), the attacker can learn nothing about \( w_b \) from \( \text{twb} \). Then, the theorem follows.

### Conclusion
In this paper, we have formulated the concept of ASE†† and attempted to provide a comprehensive security model for the primitive. As to the relationships of various security properties, the IND-CPA security against an outside attacker is implied by the ciphertext indistinguishability property against a Type-I server and the message-dependent trapdoor indistinguishability property (to be presented in the full paper due to space limit). Compared with previous works, such as those from [7, 8, 9], our formulation defines more flexible functionalities and our security model reflects a higher level of security guarantees. The security of the proposed instantiation relies on the standard DLIN and BDH assumptions in the random oracle model, which plays an important role in the double encryption structure. It is an interesting future work to investigate an instantiation in the standard model, namely without using random oracle. With regard to trapdoor security, we have designed universal one-wayness property against all attackers. There is a possibility of replacing it with the augmented notion proposed in [2] or an even stronger notion similar to the ciphertext indistinguishability property against Type-II attacker in our security model. We consider this to be another line of future work.
