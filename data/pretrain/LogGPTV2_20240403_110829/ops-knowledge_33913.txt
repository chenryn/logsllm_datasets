User: In the case of high concurrent access, how to ensure the stability of web applications?
Assistant: 1. Increase server load capacity: You can increase the server load capacity by increasing the number of servers (horizontal expansion) or upgrading the server configuration (vertical expansion). 2. Use caching technology: Using caching technology can reduce the load on the database and improve the response speed, thereby improving the stability of Web applications. 3. Load balancing: Use load balancing technology to distribute requests to multiple servers, thereby dispersing the pressure on servers and improving the stability of web applications. 4. Optimize the database: Database optimization can improve the query efficiency of the database, thereby reducing the load on the server and improving the stability of the Web application. 5. Using CDN technology: Using CDN technology can cache static resources (such as pictures, CSS, JS, etc.) on servers closer to users, thereby improving access speed, reducing server load, and improving the stability of web applications. 6. Use reverse proxy: Using reverse proxy can improve the access speed and stability of web applications, prevent malicious attacks and distribute load, etc. 7. Current limit and circuit breaker: Setting access limit and circuit breaker mechanisms can prevent server crashes due to a large number of requests and improve the stability of web applications. 8. Reasonable design architecture: When designing web applications, the pressure brought by high concurrent access should be considered, and reasonable architecture and technology should be adopted to improve the stability of web applications.
