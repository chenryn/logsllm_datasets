### Classification and Filtering of Newly Allocated Prefix

According to our classification, approximately 500 Autonomous Systems (ASes) are definitively filtering our newly allocated prefix, while nearly 2000 ASes are potentially doing so. This implies that between 2% and 7% of the entire Internet cannot see our newly allocated addresses, which is a significant issue. Moreover, this problem remains largely unchanged between our second and third experiments.

### Extent of Upstream Provider Filtering

To assess the extent of upstream provider filtering, we analyzed the location of these reachability issues. Since we cannot rigorously determine where probes are dropped due to the lack of visibility into reverse paths, we categorized the ASes in our list. An AS was classified as a transit AS if it appeared as an intermediate node in any of our traceroute measurements; otherwise, it was labeled as an end-point or stub-AS. Figure 8 illustrates the percentage of each category among ASes with reachability problems. The majority of these ASes are stub ASes, suggesting that most issues occur at the edge of the network. This is intuitively reasonable, as transit providers, who generally have more experience with BGP, are less likely to leave stale filters in their networks. The small number of transit providers (a few hundred) who incorrectly configure filters can lead to misidentification of edge nodes as filtering when they are not.

### Persistence of Bogon Filters

As shown in Figure 7, bogon filters are not removed quickly. Our experiments from April to June 2008 revealed minimal changes, despite a reminder sent to operators in mid-April to remove filters for this address space. This aligns with the operator community's perception and was the primary reason for commissioning this experiment.

### Feedback from Network Administrators

In our first campaign, we identified a list of ASes with no connectivity to our address space. Using the Internet Routing Registries (IRRs), we found email contacts for these ASes and manually contacted around 75 operators via email, asking if they were filtering the newly allocated address space. We received only 17 replies. Ten ISPs confirmed that they had outdated bogon filters, and two indicated that their upstream providers were filtering. These responses are encouraging, as our methodology aims to identify regions with no reachability rather than to blame operators. This underscores the need for caution in using our methodology, as it can detect areas with limited connectivity but should not be used for finger-pointing. Implementing such a service within the registries must be carefully considered, as ASes with default routes pointing to their upstream are affected by the filters of their upstream.

Additionally, three operators responded with confusion, suggesting a lack of understanding of the issue. This indicates that these ASes might be operated by individuals who do not know how to maintain their filters. Although these responses neither confirmed nor denied the existence of bogon filters, they raised suspicions about their presence. We received only two replies stating they had no such filters, and one of those was due to an IRR lookup error. The single meaningful negative reply did not mention connectivity, so it may also fall into the category of an AS whose upstream was incorrectly filtering the prefix.

### Methodological Issues and Measurement Confidence

#### Topological Coverage

The motivation for outbound probes is to "look" into areas of the Internet where no BGP monitors or looking glasses exist, primarily at the edge. However, this part of the Internet is large and rapidly changing, making it challenging to achieve good visibility. The idea is to measure reachability by sending outbound probes to the edge and drawing conclusions based on the responses. Several requirements for the IP address list must be considered, including wide coverage, fine granularity within ASes, and limiting the number of probes.

#### Finding Pingable IP Addresses

Obtaining a large number of pingable IP addresses is crucial for large-scale topology discovery. Many projects use existing lists of IP addresses, such as those from CAIDA, which are based on passive measurements. We also used active discovery techniques and brute-force scanning for a small portion of the address space. By sharing and merging our IP lists with other researchers, we obtained a pool of 4,655,238 IP addresses.

#### AS-Level Coverage

We selected a subset of 306,780 IP addresses for our measurements, covering 154,683 pingable prefixes in 25,780 pingable ASes. Our selection criteria included probing as many ASes as possible, aiming for 30 pingable IP addresses per AS, and covering diverse prefixes within an AS. If all prefixes are covered and the threshold of 30 is not reached, we improve confidence by obtaining multiple pingable IP addresses within the considered prefix.

#### Stability of Pingable IP Addresses

The stability of our list of pingable IP addresses is critical. From April to June 2008, we observed that 95.8% of all IPs that were pingable in April remained pingable over the following two months. However, 2.2% of those IP addresses did not respond during that period. Some IP addresses may behave erratically due to factors such as dial-up connections, ICMP rate-limiting, and overloaded links. We estimate our error rate to be between 2% and 5%.

#### Consistency Across Probing Locations

The location from which the address space is advertised can yield different results. Non-homogeneously configured routers or packet filters on certain links can impact our probing. Differences in how probes enter and traverse a given AS may result in variations in our findings. However, the results of our bogon experiments (Section 5.2) show that differences between locations are minimal.
