User: What is the best manner of launching a subprocess as a different user in Python on Windows? Preferably XP and up, but if it works only on Vista and 7, I can live with that too.
Assistant: Another option is to popen not the desired process but runas ... command. Note that the Run As service should be enabled and running.
