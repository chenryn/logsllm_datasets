The following code produces corrupted output when run on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the latest Rust master branch (pulled on February 25th):

```rust
let arr: ~[&str] = std::os::args()[1].split_str("::").collect();
std::io::println("first " + arr[0]);
std::io::println("first again " + arr[0]);
```

To compile and run the code, use the following commands:
```bash
$ rustc isolate_issue.rs
$ ./isolate_issue "foo::bar"
```
Output:
```
first fir
first again
```

Ashish Myles pointed out that an earlier version of Rust failed to compile this code, generating an error about the reference to the return value of `std::os::args()` not being valid for the duration of its use. This issue is discussed in more detail [here](https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2014-February/008796.html).

To resolve the issue, you can store the result of `std::os::args()` in a local variable:

```rust
let args = std::os::args();
let arr: ~[&str] = args[1].split_str("::").collect();
std::io::println("first " + arr[0]);
std::io::println("first again " + arr[0]);
```

After making this change, the output is as expected:

```bash
$ ./isolate_issue "foo::bar"
```
Output:
```
first foo
first again foo
```
