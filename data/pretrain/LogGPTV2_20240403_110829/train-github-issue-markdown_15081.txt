If We have a markup `[v-if] > content` and the content is dynamic, as long as
the content changes and make the `[v-if]` hides->shows, the content in
`[v-if]` will back to the previous [demo]. To find the actual problem, I check
the source of vuejs and find that the `[v-if]` only snapshots the content when
binding, and I also find that the implements for `instance/compile` (snapshot
for `_transCpnts`) and `compile` in `[v-if]` (snapshot for `children`) will
occur some problems (e.g., not fire the detach event) in some situations.
