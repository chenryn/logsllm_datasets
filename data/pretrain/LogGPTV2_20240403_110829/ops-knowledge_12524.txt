User: How to automate the deployment of Spring Boot applications through Jenkins?
Assistant: The following are the steps to automate the deployment of Spring Boot applications through Jenkins: 1. Install Jenkins and ensure that there is an ssh connection between the Jenkins server and the deployment target server. 2. Install the "Publish Over SSH" plugin on Jenkins (Go to Jenkins dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available -> search "Publish Over SSH" -> install). 3. Configure the SSH sender (Go to Jenkins dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Publish over SSH). 4. Specify the IP address, user name, password, and SSH port number of the SSH server, and click Test Connection to ensure a successful connection. 5. In the project, create a new build step (Build Step), select "Maven Command", and enter maven build-related commands in the "Goals" field, such as: clean install or package, etc. 6. Create a new "SSH Publish" build step, specifying the target path, deployment port, username, and password of the deployment target server. 7. In the configuration page for Source Code Management, specify the location, branch, and other details of your project repository. 8. Start Jenkins to build, test and deploy the Spring Boot application. That way, when you update your code repository, Jenkins will automatically pull the latest code and automatically build and deploy the new application.
