Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-bring-your-javascript-
slot-machine-to-life has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and
include links to screenshots if possible.
There's no syntactic reason to require double quotes. The following should
pass, but fails.
        $($('.slot')[0]).html(slotOne);
        $($('.slot')[1]).html(slotTwo);
        $($('.slot')[2]).html(slotThree);
Switching to double quotes passes.
