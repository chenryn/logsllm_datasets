Abstract. Recent studies estimate that peer-to-peer (p2p) traﬃc com-
prises 40-70% of today’s Internet traﬃc [1]. Surprisingly, the impact of
p2p traﬃc on anomaly detection has not been investigated. In this paper,
we collect and use a labeled dataset containing diverse network anoma-
lies (portscans, TCP ﬂoods, UDP ﬂoods, at varying rates) and p2p traﬃc
(encrypted and unencrypted with BitTorrent, Vuze, Flashget, μTorrent,
Deluge, BitComet, Halite, eDonkey and Kademlia clients) to empirically
quantify the impact of p2p traﬃc on anomaly detection. Four promi-
nent anomaly detectors (TRW-CB [7], Rate Limiting [8], Maximum En-
tropy [10] and NETAD [11]) are evaluated on this dataset.
Our results reveal that: 1) p2p traﬃc results in up to 30% decrease
in detection rate and up to 45% increase in false positive rate; 2) due to
a partial overlap of traﬃc behaviors, p2p traﬃc inadvertently provides
an eﬀective evasion cover for high- and low-rate attacks; and 3) training
an anomaly detector on p2p traﬃc, instead of improving accuracy, intro-
duces a signiﬁcant accuracy degradation for the anomaly detector. Based
on these results, we argue that only p2p traﬃc ﬁltering can provide a
pragmatic, yet short-term, solution to this problem. We incorporate two
prominent p2p traﬃc classiﬁers (OpenDPI [23] and Karagiannis’ Pay-
load Classiﬁer(KPC) [24]) as pre-processors into the anomaly detectors
and show that the existing non-proprietary p2p traﬃc classiﬁers do not
have suﬃcient accuracies to mitigate the negative impacts of p2p traﬃc
on anomaly detection.
Given the premise that p2p traﬃc is here to stay, our work demon-
strates the need to rethink the classical anomaly detection design phi-
losophy with a focus on performing anomaly detection in the presence
of p2p traﬃc. We make our dataset publicly available for evaluation of
future anomaly detectors that are designed to operate with p2p traﬃc.
1 Introduction
During March of 2009, a record number of 4,543 anomalies was recorded by
an open-source TRW-CB based [7] anomaly detector deployed on our school’s

network. The network administrators took it as a result of a zero-day attack
and updated the antivirus and antispyware deﬁnitions on school hosts. However,
TRW-CB continued reporting anomalies even after the update. An investigation
of this strange behavior by correlating the TRW-CB logs and the network logs
revealed that the culprit was p2p traﬃc which was being reported as anomalous.1
This strange behavior of TRW-CB was communicated to us which intrigued us
to investigate the impact of p2p traﬃc on anomaly detection.
Based on the results of our investigation, in this paper we empirically an-
swer the following open question: How much perturbations are introduced in
anomaly detection metrics by p2p traﬃc2 and how can these perturbations be
mitigated? A general answer to this question can be inferred intuitively because
some features of p2p traﬃc are quite similar to those of malicious traﬃc and
quite diﬀerent from the bulk of benign TCP traﬃc [5]. Hence, the accuracy of
an anomaly detector, which ﬂags deviations from a model of normal behavior,
is bound to degrade in the presence of p2p traﬃc. For example, the decentral-
ized and distributed nature of the p2p architecture results in establishment of
a large number of connections to random ports during boot-strap which shares
similarities with portscan attacks; compare a torrent client “scanning” over 50
peers during boot-strapping to MyDoom-A with an average scan rate of 9 scans
per minute. Similarly, high churn rate in p2p networks results in a large number
of failed connections3 which is another commonly-observed phenomenon during
portscan attacks.
While a general sense can be determined intuitively, our empirical study gives
deeper insights by breaking the above question into the following set of impor-
tant sub-questions: 1) How much degradation does p2p traﬃc induce in anomaly
detection accuracy (detection and false positive rates)? 2) Which anomaly de-
tection metrics/principles are more sensitive to p2p traﬃc and why? 3) Does
the aggressive nature of p2p traﬃc dominate some/all attack classes and high-
/low-rate attacks? 4) Can an anomaly detector handle p2p traﬃc if it is trained
on a dataset containing p2p traﬃc? 5) Can a pragmatic solution be designed to
make an anomaly detector insensitive to the p2p traﬃc? 6) Can existing public
p2p traﬃc classiﬁers mitigate the degradation in anomaly detection accuracy?
7) What are the open problems in designing anomaly detectors which operate
eﬀectively in today’s Internet traﬃc?
To empirically answer the above questions, we collect a labeled dataset con-
taining diverse network anomalies (portscans, TCP ﬂoods, UDP ﬂoods, at vary-
ing rates) and p2p traﬃc (encrypted and unencrypted with BitTorrent, Vuze,
Flashget, µTorrent, Deluge, BitComet, Halite, eDonkey and KAD clients). Since
it is not possible to evaluate all existing anomaly detectors, ROC-based

newly-built campus and the students’ usage of p2p applications in their dormitories.

video traﬃc also exhibit similar traﬃc behaviors.

accuracies of four prominent anomaly detectors (TRW-CB [7], Rate Limiting [8],
Maximum Entropy [10] and NETAD [11]) are evaluated on this dataset.
Our results reveal that all the anomaly detectors experience an unacceptable
(up to 30%) drop in detection rates and a signiﬁcant (up to 45%) increase in
false alarm rates when operating with p2p traﬃc. Henceforth in the paper, we
refer to this accuracy degradation as the torrent eﬀect on anomaly detection.
We evaluate the torrent eﬀect by evaluating the anomaly detectors on diﬀerent
attack rates and classes. We show that anomaly detectors deliver varying accu-
racies on diﬀerent attack classes and this varying performance is a function of
the design principle of a given anomaly detectors. Similarly, we show that p2p
traﬃc inadvertently acts as a very eﬀective evasion cover for low-rate attacks as
detection of such attacks is seriously aﬀected by p2p traﬃc.
Based on the signiﬁcant and consistent accuracy degradations observed in
our study, we argue that a p2p traﬃc classiﬁer based pre-processor can oﬀer
the anomaly detectors a pragmatic, albeit short-term, relief from the torrent
eﬀect.4 By incorporating OpenDPI [23] into the IDSs we see 12% improvement
in detection accuracy with 4% reduction in false positive rate. Similarly, incor-
porating KPC [24] results in 18% improvement in detection accuracy and a 48%
reduction in false positive rate. However, even with these improvements, existing
non-proprietary p2p traﬃc classiﬁers do not have suﬃcient traﬃc classiﬁcation
accuracies to eliminate the torrent eﬀect.
Recent trends indicate that the volume of p2p traﬃc is reducing as service
providers are now deploying commercial p2p traﬃc classiﬁers to throttle p2p
traﬃc in real-time [1]-[4]. Nevertheless, due to the ubiquity and popularity of
p2p networks and software, even with reduced-volumes, p2p traﬃc is antici-
pated to continue comprising a signiﬁcant percentage of the Internet’s traﬃc in
the coming years [34]. We therefore advocate a fundamental rethinking of the
anomaly detection design philosophy with future anomaly detectors catering for
p2p traﬃc in their inherent design. We make our dataset publicly available for
evaluation of such future anomaly detectors.
2 Related Work and Background
While signiﬁcant research has recently been focused towards evaluating and un-
derstanding trends in anomaly detection [16], to the best of our knowledge, the
impact of p2p traﬃc on intrusion detection has not been explored. Therefore, in
this section we only provide a brief overview of the anomaly detectors evaluated
in this work; interested readers are referred to the original papers [7],[8],[10] and
[11] for detailed descriptions of the anomaly detectors.
The Rate Limiting approach [8], detects anomalous connection behavior by
putting new connections exceeding a certain threshold in a queue. An alarm is
raised when the queue length exceeds a threshold. TRW-CB [7] limits the rate
at which new connections are initiated by applying the sequential hypothesis

their products [31]-[33].

testing and by using a credit increase/decrease algorithm to slow down hosts
that are experiencing unsuccessful connections. The Maximum Entropy based
detector [10] estimates the benign traﬃc’s baseline distribution using Maxi-
mum Entropy method by dividing the traﬃc into 2,348 packet classes. These
packet classes are deﬁned based on destination ports and the transport proto-
cols. Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence measure is then used to ﬂag anomalies if
divergence from the baseline distribution exceeds a threshold from the baseline
distribution. NETAD [11] operates on rule-based ﬁltered traﬃc in a modeled
subset of common protocols. It computes a packet score depending on the time
and frequency of each byte of packet, and rare/novel header values are assigned
high scores. A threshold is applied on a packet’s score to ﬁnd anomalous packets.
For performance evaluations, parameter tuning for these anomaly detectors is
performed in the same fashion as in a recent evaluation study [35].
We chose these anomaly detectors to ensure diversity because these detec-
tors have very diﬀerent detection principles and features, and operate at dif-
ferent traﬃc granularities. On the one hand, we use Rate Limiting [8] which is
a connection-based programmed system using a thresholding approach, while,
on the other hand, we use a statistical programmed system, TRW-CB [7]. Sim-
ilarly, we employ an information-theoretic self-learning system like Maximum
Entropy [10] as opposed to NETAD [11] which is a packet-based rule-modeling
system.
3 Dataset Description
For the present problem, we wanted to use real, labeled and public background
and attack datasets to measure the accuracy. Furthermore, for comprehensive
evaluation, we needed attacks of diﬀerent types (DoS, portscan, etc.) and dif-
ferent rates for each attack type. Finally, we needed labeled p2p traﬃc from
various clients and p2p protocols in our dataset. While some old attack datasets
are available [17]-[19], they do not contain p2p traﬃc and do not contain at-
tacks of diﬀerent types. Therefore, we collect our own network traﬃc dataset
and make it publicly available for repeatable performance evaluations.5 The rest
of this section describes our data collection methodology.
We collect dataset in our campus network. The research labs in our campus are
located in research wing and traﬃc from each research lab is relayed through a
3COM4500G switch to research wing’s Cisco 3750 router using ﬁber connections,
as shown in Figure 1. The wing router is connected to the distribution router
which handles traﬃc of the entire campus. The research wing router routes traﬃc
for over 50 computers. Three computers in our research lab were used to generate
attack traﬃc. P2P traﬃc was generated by hosting p2p ﬁle sharing applications
on twelve computers in diﬀerent labs. Due to privacy constraints, we were only
allowed to collect traces at the research wing router. We now provide the details
for normal, p2p and attack traﬃc in our dataset.

3.1 Normal Traﬃc
We captured the normal traﬃc in six periods, each one of over three hours. Dur-
ing traﬃc capturing, diﬀerent applications were hosted on the machines including
ﬁle transfer, web browsing, instant messaging, real-time video streaming, etc. It
was ensured that during normal traﬃc capturing, no p2p application was hosted
on any of the client machines. The mean packet rate recorded for the background
traﬃc was about 3168 pkts/sec and the standard deviation was 1683 pkts/sec.
3.2 P2P Traﬃc
The p2p traﬃc in our traces belongs to the BitTorrent, eDonkey and Kademlia
protocols. These protocols were chosen as representative traﬃc from p2p traﬃc
