Statewide Interoperability 
Communications Solution - $36.7M 
(Funded in three phases) - In the 
summer of 2003, Florida began building 
an interoperable communications 
network which provides IP-based connectivity for over 200 
dispatch centers in the state.  By linking the dispatch centers, 
the interoperability network provides instantaneous links between systems that are not 
yet connected. The network will provide statewide coverage; it will not be limited to a 
regional coverage area.  
• 
In addition to connecting the various interdisciplinary radio systems, Florida has 
provided the necessary coverage enhancements needed to complement existing mutual 
aid coverage in all four bands (low band, high band, UHF, 800 MHz) throughout the 
State.  The ability to 
link disparate systems 
on different radio bands 
is necessary as 
incidents generally 
require a variety of first 
response agencies.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
• The state has undertaken a project that will increase communications 
abilities and create a statewide interoperable system by 2010.  The 
plan will start with the population centers and systematically 
incorporate surrounding areas.  The eight regional advisory councils 
and the Georgia State Patrol are working in conjunction to insure this 
is a successful system. 
• Additionally the state has procured 10 mobile communications centers with varying 
intensity capabilities.  
Most notably, the 
Gwinnett County PD has 
a mobile center with 
800mhz capacity.  In the 
event of a major 
emergency this mobile 
center can take over the 
communications 
demands for any major 
urban area in the state, 
including the city of 
Atlanta.

Improved communication throughout the Government of Guam (GovGuam) and 
responder agencies.  
Guam has also completed an aggressive upgrade to their basic communications 
system through ACU 3000 and several mobile and portable radio’s that allows 
agencies to interface seamlessly during emergency response.  Furthermore, the communications 
project has been instrumental in developing a state of the art EOC that is under construction and 
will provide the Territory with 
a secured communication 
networking facility.
