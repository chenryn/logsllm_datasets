A Concrete Instantiation of Saint
policies with FlaskDroid
Listing 3 shows an instantiation of the developer pol-
icy in [39] on FlaskDroid. This policy is deployed by
the shopping app and thus self_t refers to the shop-
ping app. We deﬁne types app_trustedPayApp_t,
app_trustedPayApp_t,
app_noInternetPerm_t
(lines 1-3 and lines 8-16) for the speciﬁc apps
the shopping app is allowed to interact with
and describe some of the allowed interactions by
Intent types intent_actionPay_t and
means of
intent_recordExpense_t (lines 5-6 and lines
18-24). Afterwards, we declare access control rules
that reﬂect the policy described in [39] (lines 26-28).
For instance, the rule in line 26 deﬁnes that the
shopping app is allowed to send an Intent with
action string ACTION_PAY only to an app with type
app_trustedPayApp_t (line 20), which in turn is
only assigned to apps with the developer signature
308201... (line 9).
Listing 3: Policy deployed by the shopping app, show-
ing an instantiation of the Saint [39] runtime policy
example.
