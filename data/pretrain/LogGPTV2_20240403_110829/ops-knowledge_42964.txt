User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How does t-mobile's secureauthentication Twitter app work? If you try to get support from T-Mobile using Twitter, they'll try to get you to allow an app that only has permission to view your tweets and your followers. How does this help T-Mobile authenticate you?

tmobile.secureauthentication.com

This application will be able to:
Read Tweets from your timeline.
See who you follow.

Will not be able to:
Follow new people.
Update your profile.
Post Tweets for you.
Access your direct messages.
See your Twitter password.

Assistant: This is the standard OAuth flow that third-party applications use to allow Twitter accounts to log into their site, and optionally have write access to the account, though in this case T-Mobile hasn't requested this permission as they have no good reason to.

What T-Mobile is most likely doing is that they use this to make sure you are the owner of the Twitter account (as opposed to just sending a link via direct messages which can be seen by anyone if it accidentally leaks) and finally associate the Twitter account with your T-Mobile user model in their CRM system.
