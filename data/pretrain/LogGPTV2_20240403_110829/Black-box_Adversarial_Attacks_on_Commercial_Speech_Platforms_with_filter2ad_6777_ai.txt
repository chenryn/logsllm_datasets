Note that, (i) this table shows the SNRs of the AEs generated from Occam and NI-Occam, and ‚Äú-‚Äù denotes this AE fails. (ii) In total, the SRoAs of Occam against Alibaba SSR API,
NI-Occam against Cortana, and NI-Occam against Apple Siri are 100%, 71.7%, and 58.3%, respectively.

Note that, (i) ‚Ä°: WER (Word Error Rate) is a common metric to measure the per-
formance of speech recognition systems. WER calculates the ratio of the minimum
number of word-level operations, including substitutions, deletions and insertions,
required to convert the transcribed text into the target text, to the total number of
words. A lower WER indicates a higher accuracy of ASR systems. (ii) $: Adversarial
training is conducted on the Mini LibriSpeech dataset that contains 5 hours of training
data and 2 hours of test data. (iii) ‚Ä†: Audio AEs are generated using NI-Occam in Kaldi
(Mini LibriSpeech model).
