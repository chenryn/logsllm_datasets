### Expected Behavior
Flask pulls a compatible version of Werkzeug
    # Paste a minimal example that causes the problem.
### Actual Behavior
flask currently requires Werkzeug >= 0.15 but we recently noticed that some of
our existing flask applications were broken. In fact we were (still) running
flask 0.12.4 and as it is now it is pulling Werkzeug 1.0.0 which is
incompatible (breaks at runtime).

As described in the SO post, upgrading flask >= 1.0 fixes this but I thought
I'd still report this in case you think its worth releasing a 0.12.5, I could
do the change in setup.py.
### Environment
  * Python version: 3.8
  * Flask version: 0.12.4
  * Werkzeug version: 1.0
