possibility exists because these are places where, as François Jégou said in his public 
lecture at Parsons (spring 2012), there is the “right to fail.”  
Summarizing, in these experimental spaces it is possible to trigger and support 
positive loops between bottom-up initiatives and public agencies’ innovations and, 
therefore, to promote the complex systemic innovations that today are critically 
needed.

FOREWORD
This book maps the DESIS Labs’ efforts to date and their degrees of success. It 
includes 11 articles that present from a critical perspective the labs’ projects and 
activities during the 2012-2013 period. In our attempt as editors to organize these 
very unique experiences and contributions, four key topics emerged as particularly 
compelling and established the structure for the book:
1. Designing New Relationships Between People and the State: Peer-Production in 
Public Services? Emerging Themes for Design Research and Action, by Andrea Botero, 
Joanna Saad-Sulonen (Finland); Service Design for Intercultural Dialog: Making a 
Step Forward Towards a Multicultural Society, by Margherita Pillan, Irina Suteu (Italy); 
Reflections on Designing for Social Innovation in the Public Sector: A Case Study in New 
York City, by Eduardo Staszowski, Scott Brown, Benjamin Winter (US).
2. Design Schools as Agents of Change: Seven Reflections on Design for Social 
Innovation, Students & a Neighbourhood, by Nik Baerten (Belgium); Learning Together: 
Students and Community Groups Co-designing for Carbon Reduction in London Borough 
of Camden, by Adam Thorpe, Lorraine Gamman (UK).
3. Experimental Places for Social and Public Innovation: Participatory Design for 
Social and Public Innovation: Living Labs as Spaces of Agonistic Experiments and 
Friendly Hacking, by Per-Anders Hillgren (Sweden); Experimenting Towards a Partner 
State: Public Innovation Places as Places of Exception, by Virginia Tassinari (Belgium);

The book opens with Christian Bason’s paper, Discovering Co-
production by Design. In this paper Bason, Director of Denmark's 
MindLab, proposes a broad view of how design is entering the 
public realm and the policymaking processes. His essay offers 
updated and stimulating context for the entire book.
Note: this book is the result of a collaborative endeavor and 
produced with minimum resources. For that reason a simple 
set of guidelines was provided for each author on how to 
submit their articles. Unfortunately, professional copyediting 
and proofreading of each article was not possible. The authors 
made their best efforts to provide their texts in clear English. 
All statements of fact, opinion, or analysis expressed in the 
articles are those of the respective authors.
DESIS NETWORK
DESIS is an international network of 
design schools and organizations focused 
on design for social innovation and 
sustainability, in which research labs based 
in different cities are developing parallel 
projects at the intersection of public 
services, social innovation, and design.

DISCOVERING 
CO-PRODUCTION BY DESIGN
Christian Bason
ABSTRACT
CO-DESIGN  //  CO-PRODUCTION  //  PUBLIC MANAGEMENT  //  COLLABORATION  //  CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT
Over the past decade design has increasingly been viewed by private firms as an approach that 
is central to innovation. This is also the case in public sector organizations. Although still in its 
early phases, terms such as design thinking, service design, co-design, human centered design and 
strategic design – which signify more collaborative approaches to design practice – are gaining 
prevalence in a growing number of countries, and at all levels of the public sector.
This article explores how such design methods, including user research and involvement, ideation, 
prototyping and experimentation, are experienced and used by public managers. As public managers 
utilize design processes in their quest for more innovative policies and services, what models for 
public service provision arise as a result? The article argues that design-led innovation processes 
appear to lead to more co-productive approaches to public service provision, which build on the 
motivation and resources of both end-users and other key stakeholders. By using design, public 
managers are enabled to shift their organizations towards a more networked and inclusive model 
of governance and service provision. If that is indeed the case, design-led innovation holds a radical 
and disruptive potential for public sector organizations, which may lead to better outcomes at less 
cost.

1.  INTRODUCTION
Public managers are under almost unprecedented 
pressure to deliver more value while reigning in 
cost. From Europe to the UK and the US, austerity 
measures have been put in place which leave no 
doubt that governments will be severely cash-
strapped for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, 
“wicked” societal challenges abound, spanning from 
youth unemployment, chronic healthcare issues such 
as diabetes, and to new patterns of globalization, 
immigration and social differentiation. All this requires 
smarter solutions in increasingly turbulent, complex 
and interdependent societal and human settings1.
This growth in both turbulence and complexity 
has been associated, perhaps coincidentally, by an 
increasingly systematic exploration of what design 
can do for government. We appear to be seeing a 
period of rapid experimentation, often framed in 
the context of new forms of citizen involvement: 
“Citizen engagement aims at opening up new 
avenues for empowering citizens to play an active 
role in service design, service delivery and, perhaps 
most importantly, the ongoing process of service 
innovation”2. Public sector organizations in countries 
such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, France, 
Denmark, the UK, Canada and the United States have 
to varying degrees and in different forms taken up 
such design approaches as a tool to drive innovation 
and change. Just within the past year, several of these 
governments have even set up their own Innovation 
Labs and Design Centres. The application of design in 
the public sector is none the less still highly emergent 
and points to the flexibility, if not the indeterminacy 
of design, so that “much confusion surrounds design 
practice”3. 
1.1 Design as an emerging field
As the late Herbert Simon proposed already in the 
1960s, design can be understood as the human 
endeavor of converting actual into preferred 
situations.4 Richard Buchanan argues that design 
can be thought of as a liberal art of technological 
culture. In this definition, design is viewed as an 
integrative, supple discipline, “amenable to radically

different interpretations in philosophy as well as in 
practice”.5 Current developments in design certainly 
seem to indicate that design has not one, but many 
shapes. According to Buchanan, design affects 
contemporary life in at least four areas: Symbolic and 
visual communication, the design of material objects 
(construction), design of activities and organized 
services (strategic planning), and finally the design of 
complex systems or environments for living, working, 
playing and learning (systemic integration).
“Current developments in 
design certainly seem to 
indicate that design has not 
one, but many shapes.”
It is Buchanan’s latter, service- and strategy-oriented 
application of design that are of main interest in this 
article. Elizabeth Sanders and Jan Pieter Stappers6 
argue that design as a discipline is indeed undergoing 
a significant transformation, which places it more 
squarely at the heart of an organisation’s ability to 
create new valuable solutions. Disciplines such as 
service design, which focuses on (re)designing service 
processes, or experience design, which focuses on 
designing a particular user experience, are in rapid 
growth. Similarly, there is a growing interest of 
design for ‘social good’, which in part is captured by 
the movement of social entrepreneurship and social 
innovation7, and in part by the growing interest in 
innovation within the public sector itself.8
1.2 Design in public management
One the one hand, public administrations are intended 
as stable and reliable vehicles for expressing the 
values and preferences of citizens and communities. 
On the other hand, however, “high-level government 
executives are pre-occupied with maintaining 
their agencies in a complex, conflict-ridden, and 
unpredictable political environment (...)”.9 Thus public

organizations must strike a balance between stability 
and dynamism, between managing the status quo and 
creating new futures. Given the current environment, 
the main challenge for public managers may very well 
be the latter. But creating new and better solutions 
pose new demands. In my own most recent book I 
argue that there are a range of barriers to innovation 
in government at numerous levels: The political 
context (which means that objectives are usually 
politically given and prone to significant change 
outside of the public manager’s control); the lack of 
regular market competition and multiple ‘bottom lines’, 
making it difficult to measure and assess success or 
failure; limited ability to make and shape long-term 
strategy; hierarchical and bureaucratic organisational 
structures; limited and often inefficient leveraging of 
new information technology; and (too) homogenous 
a composition of managers and staff, just to name a 
few.10
“Lawyers, economists and 
political scientists are 
expert analysts but less 
comfortable with more 
“designerly”, interpretive 
thinking styles.”
Introducing design – and, more generally, the concept 
of innovation – to the public sector thus constitutes a 
challenge. Lawyers, economists and political scientists 
are expert analysts but less comfortable with more 
“designerly”, interpretive thinking styles. Emotion and 
intuition is hardly recognised as a basis for decision-
making. None the less, as Henry Mintzberg11 has 
pointedly argued, ‘judgement’ is, at the end of the day, 
what managers have to rely on, since the traditional 
notion of decision-making as the process of choosing 
between a given set of alternatives is increasingly 
untenable.12 Public bureaucracies may have to alter 
how they deal with the notions surrounding traditional 
‘economic man‘ theories of decision-making, which 
prescribe a logical sequence of intelligence (research 
or data), design (plan) and choice (decision among a 
fixed set of alternatives) – in that order. There seems to 
be a contribution to be made by exploring how design 
approaches are applied in public sector organisations, 
and what it means.
2. TOWARDS CO-PRODUCTION AS GOVERNANCE 
MODEL?
This article explores a potential shift in the underlying 
governance model of many public services, from a 
model that is largely designed around the delivery of 
services to people, towards a model that is designed to 
better enable co-production of services with people.
2.1 Aligning the public sector with the 21st century
The wider context can be viewed as a shift from 
a classic ‘bureaucratic’ model over ‘new public 
management’ to what has more recently been termed 
‘networked governance’.13 However, as Bourgon14 points 
out, in spite of the emergence of new articulations 
of what governance is or could be “Public sector 
organisations are not yet aligned in theory and in 
practice with the new global context or with the 
problems they have for their mission to solve”.
The point of departure for this article therefore is 
that there are several alternative paradigms in which 
to view and interpret models of public governance. 
How might the design approaches influence public 
managers’ ability to identify models that are better 
suited to their mission (or indeed, drive change in that 
mission itself) in order to produce more value for the 
public service system and for end-users?
This article is not about theory-testing, but about 
theory-building; however, in order to put the research 
focus into context, I will briefly consider what might 
characterise such a new model, or paradigm of public 
governance, which is related to Hartley’s notion of 
networked governance as a model where citizens 
become co-producers.15 As Aalto University’s Andrea 
Botero states in a recent publication on peer-to-peer 
production of public services, “There are changes 
taking place in how the role of citizens in society is

experienced – in terms of how they feel responsible for 
things happening – and also in what is expected from 
them.”16 If this is truly an emerging trend, could design 
have something to do with it, or even amplify it?
2.2 Defining co-production
Peer-to-peer production, or co-production, is by no 
means a new concept. In fact, the term was originally 
coined in the early 1970s by Nobel laureate Elinor 
Ostrom. She developed the term to describe the 
“relationship that could exist between the ‘regular 
producer’ (such as street-level police officers, social 
workers or health workers) and their clients, who 
wanted to be transformed by the service into safer, 
better-educated or healthier persons.”17 Over the 
last couple of decades, various more elaborate 
definitions of co-production have been offered. Dr. 
Edgar Cahn defines co-production as a framework 
and set of techniques used by social service 
organizations to enlist active client participation in 
service programming.18 Boyle and Harris describe co-
production as “delivering public services in an equal 
and reciprocal relationship between professionals, 
people using services, their families and their 
neighbors. Where activities are co-produced in this 
way, both services and neighborhoods become far 
more effective agents of change.”19
What might be driving this renewed interest in 
co-production is the depth of the economic crisis 
governments currently find themselves in, and thereby 
the need to identify different, better and (not least) 
cheaper ways of getting things done. Co-production 
promises this by leveraging other resources than 
those of the public sector. I explore this as “the growth 
of new and different ways to involve users of social 
services as co-producers of their own and others’ 
services.”20 
3. METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH
This article builds on a qualitative study of individual 
public managers who have had key responsibility 
for, or the opportunity of, utilising design to address

certain problems, opportunities or to create one or 
more new solutions or actions within public policies 
or services. Methodologically I take inspiration 
from the grounded theory approach to qualitative 
research.21 This implies amongst other things a focus 
on exploration, discovery, qualitative and idiographic 
research, empathy, judgement, social action and 
interaction, meanings, cognition, emotion, closeness to 
the empirical material and successive induction.22 
The criterion for choosing a manager for interview has 
been that some combination of design approaches 
have been applied, usually labelled explicitly as 
“service design”, “co-design”, “co-creation” or “strategic 
design”. The research strategy has been to let the
