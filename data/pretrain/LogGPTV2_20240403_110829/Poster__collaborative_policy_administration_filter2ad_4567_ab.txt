### Possibility and the "Right to Fail"

The potential for innovation exists in spaces where, as François Jégou stated in his public lecture at Parsons (Spring 2012), there is a "right to fail." In these experimental environments, it is possible to initiate and support positive feedback loops between grassroots initiatives and public agency innovations. Consequently, these spaces can foster the complex systemic innovations that are critically needed today.

   - *Physicians as Co-designers: Changing the Practice of Care* by Kristin Hughes and Peter Scupelli (US)

The book opens with Christian Bason's paper, *Discovering Co-production by Design*. As the Director of Denmark's MindLab, Bason provides a broad perspective on how design is entering the public realm and policymaking processes, setting a stimulating context for the entire book.

**Note:** This book is the result of a collaborative effort with limited resources. Authors were provided with simple guidelines for submitting their articles. Professional copyediting and proofreading were not possible, but the authors made their best efforts to ensure clear English.

### DESIS NETWORK Overview

DESIS is an international network of design schools and organizations focused on design for social innovation and sustainability. Research labs based in different cities are developing parallel projects at the intersection of public services, social innovation, and design.

### Discovering Co-Production by Design

#### Abstract
**Keywords:** Co-Design, Co-Production, Public Management, Collaboration, Citizen Engagement

Over the past decade, design has increasingly been viewed by private firms as central to innovation. This trend is also evident in the public sector, where terms such as design thinking, service design, co-design, human-centered design, and strategic design are gaining prevalence. This article explores how such design methods, including user research, ideation, prototyping, and experimentation, are used by public managers. It argues that design-led innovation processes lead to more co-productive approaches to public service provision, leveraging the motivation and resources of both end-users and other key stakeholders. By using design, public managers can shift their organizations towards a more networked and inclusive model of governance and service provision, potentially leading to better outcomes at lower costs.

#### 1. Introduction

Public managers face unprecedented pressure to deliver more value while controlling costs. Austerity measures in Europe, the UK, and the US have left governments severely cash-strapped. Simultaneously, societal challenges such as youth unemployment, chronic healthcare issues, and new patterns of globalization and immigration require smarter solutions in increasingly turbulent, complex, and interdependent settings.

This growth in turbulence and complexity coincides with a systematic exploration of what design can do for government. Public sector organizations in various countries have adopted design approaches to drive innovation and change. However, the application of design in the public sector is still emergent and flexible, leading to some confusion.

##### 1.1 Design as an Emerging Field

Herbert Simon proposed in the 1960s that design is the human endeavor of converting actual into preferred situations. Richard Buchanan views design as a liberal art of technological culture, integrative and supple, amenable to various interpretations. Current developments indicate that design has many forms, affecting contemporary life in areas such as symbolic and visual communication, material objects, activities and organized services, and complex systems.

Buchanan’s service- and strategy-oriented applications of design are of primary interest here. Disciplines like service design and experience design are growing rapidly, and there is increasing interest in design for social good, captured by social entrepreneurship and social innovation.

##### 1.2 Design in Public Management

Public administrations must balance stability and dynamism, managing the status quo while creating new futures. Creating new and better solutions poses new demands. Barriers to innovation in government include political context, lack of market competition, hierarchical structures, and homogenous staff composition.

Introducing design and innovation to the public sector is challenging. Lawyers, economists, and political scientists are expert analysts but less comfortable with interpretive thinking styles. Emotion and intuition are not typically recognized as bases for decision-making. However, Henry Mintzberg argues that judgment is essential, as traditional decision-making models are becoming untenable. Public bureaucracies may need to alter their approach to decision-making, and exploring how design approaches are applied in public sector organizations could be valuable.

#### 2. Towards Co-Production as a Governance Model?

This article explores a potential shift in the underlying governance model of public services from a delivery-focused model to one that enables co-production with people.

##### 2.1 Aligning the Public Sector with the 21st Century

The context is a shift from a classic bureaucratic model to networked governance. Despite new articulations of governance, public sector organizations are not yet aligned with the new global context or the problems they need to solve. The article aims to identify how design approaches can help public managers identify and implement better-suited models to produce more value for the public service system and end-users.

##### 2.2 Defining Co-Production

Co-production, or peer-to-peer production, is not a new concept. Elinor Ostrom coined the term in the early 1970s to describe the relationship between regular producers (e.g., police officers, social workers) and their clients. Various definitions of co-production have emerged, emphasizing active client participation and equal, reciprocal relationships between professionals and service users.

The renewed interest in co-production may be driven by the economic crisis, necessitating cheaper and more effective ways of delivering services. Co-production leverages resources beyond the public sector, involving users as co-producers of their own and others' services.

#### 3. Methodological Approach

This article is based on a qualitative study of public managers who have utilized design to address problems, opportunities, or create new solutions within public policies or services. The methodological approach draws from grounded theory, focusing on exploration, discovery, qualitative and idiographic research, empathy, judgment, social action, interaction, meanings, cognition, emotion, and closeness to empirical material. The criterion for selecting managers was the application of design approaches labeled as "service design," "co-design," "co-creation," or "strategic design." The research strategy allowed the analytical process to drive data collection, fitting the emergent nature of this field.
