**Subject: Issue with Downloading Large Files Using Mechanize and a Potential Workaround**

I am currently using the `mechanize` library to download files. While files smaller than 1GB are downloaded without any issues, attempting to download files larger than 1GB results in a memory error. Specifically, the `mechanize_response.py` script throws an "out of memory" error at the following line:

```python
self.__cache.write(self.wrapped.read())
```

Here, `__cache` is an instance of `cStringIO.StringIO`, which appears to be unable to handle more than 1GB of data.

### **Question:**
How can I download files larger than 1GB using `mechanize`?

### **Workaround:**
I have found a workaround that allows me to download files larger than 1GB. Instead of using `browser.retrieve` or `browser.open`, I used `mechanize.urlopen`, which returns a `urllib2` handler. This approach successfully handles large file downloads.

```python
import mechanize

# Open the URL and get the response
response = mechanize.urlopen(url)

# Save the response content to a file
with open('large_file.zip', 'wb') as f:
    while True:
        chunk = response.read(8192)
        if not chunk:
            break
        f.write(chunk)
```

### **Further Inquiry:**
While this workaround is effective, I am still interested in understanding how to make `browser.retrieve` or `browser.open` work for files larger than 1GB. Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.
