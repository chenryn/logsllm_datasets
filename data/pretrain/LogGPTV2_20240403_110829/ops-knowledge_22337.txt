User:  How to configure Nginx to implement reverse proxy of HTTPS protocol?
Assistant: Before configuring nginx to implement the reverse proxy of the HTTPS protocol, you need to prepare the following necessary steps: 1. Apply for an SSL certificate, and you can obtain a free certificate through a certificate authority such as Let's Encrypt. 2. Install nginx and make sure the ssl module is enabled. 3. Determine the port of the proxy server and the port of the target server. Next, follow the steps below to configure nginx to implement the reverse proxy of the HTTPS protocol: 1. In the nginx configuration file, enable ssl support and configure the certificate: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /path/to/ssl /certificate.pem; # Replace with your own certificate path ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ssl/private-key.pem; # Replace with your own private key path server_name proxy.example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend -server:8080; # Replace with the address of the target server} } ``` 2. Wait for the DNS resolution to end, and add the above server_name to the IP address of the nginx server in the local hosts file. 3. Restart the nginx server and visit https://proxy.example.com, nginx will automatically forward the request to the target server. In this way, the reverse proxy configuration of the HTTPS protocol is completed, and the effects of secure data transmission and load balancing are realized. It should be noted that there are sensitive data in the configuration, which need to be properly protected to avoid leakage.
