### fsutil sparse
**Applies to:** Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows 10, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8

**Description:**
The `fsutil sparse` command is used to manage sparse files. A sparse file is a file that contains one or more regions of unallocated data. When a program reads these unallocated regions, it sees them as containing bytes with a zero value, even though no disk space is actually allocated for these zeros. Sparse file support allows data to be deallocated from anywhere in the file, optimizing storage usage.

**Syntax:**
```sh
fsutil sparse [command] [parameters]
```

**Commands:**
- **queryflag**: Queries whether a file is marked as sparse.
- **queryrange**: Scans a file and identifies ranges that may contain nonzero data.
- **setflag**: Marks the specified file as sparse.
- **setrange**: Fills a specified range of a file with zeros.

**Parameters:**
- **file**: Specifies the full path to the file, including the file name and extension (e.g., `C:\documents\filename.txt`).
- **offset**: Specifies the offset within the file where the sparse region should start.
- **length**: Specifies the length of the region in the file to be marked as sparse (in bytes).

**Remarks:**
- All meaningful or nonzero data in a sparse file is allocated, while large strings of zeros are not allocated.
- In a sparse file, large ranges of zeros do not require disk allocation. Space for nonzero data is allocated as needed when the file is written.
- Only compressed or sparse files can have zeroed ranges known to the operating system.
- If the file is sparse or compressed, NTFS may de-allocate disk space within the file, setting the range of bytes to zeros without extending the file size.

**Examples:**
- To mark a file named `sample.txt` in the `c:\temp` directory as sparse, use the following command:
  ```sh
  fsutil sparse setflag c:\temp\sample.txt
  ```

This command will mark `sample.txt` as a sparse file, allowing for efficient storage of large regions of zeros.
