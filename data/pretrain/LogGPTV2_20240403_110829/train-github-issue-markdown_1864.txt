I suggest we use the data wrangling cheat sheet from RStudio (available [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)) as a template. We can adapt it by substituting the R functions with their equivalent pandas functions. Additionally, we should update the "Comparison with R" section to reflect the differences and similarities between R and pandas.

Is anyone interested in taking on this task?
