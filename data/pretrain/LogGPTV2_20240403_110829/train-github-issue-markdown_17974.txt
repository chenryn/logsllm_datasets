It is dangerous to assume a number that has a distance unit omitted from it,
should be pixel-based.
Working within the SVG user space, it is sometimes required that number values
are left unitless, so that they're proportionate to the user-defined matrix.
The is also the additional overhead in maintaining a property (that accepts a
unitless number value) whitelist, instead of just allowing a pass-through.
