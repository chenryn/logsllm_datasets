User: I'm writing a python library that has a per-user configuration file that can be edited by the user of the library.  The library also generates logging files.
  On *nix, the standard seems to be to dump them in $HOME/.library_name.
However, I am not sure what to do with Windows users.  I've used windows for years before switching to Linux and it seems that applications tended to either A) rely on GUI configuration (which I'd rather not develop) or B) dump configuration data in the registry (which is annoying to develop and not portable with the *nix config files)
I currently am dumping the files into the $HOME/.library_name on windows as well, but this feels very unnatural on Windows.
  I've considered placing it into %APPDATA%, where application data tends to live, but this has its own problems though.  My biggest concern is that lay users might not even know where that directory is (unlike %HOME/~), and user-editable configuration files don't seem to go here normally.
What is the standard location for per-user editable config files on windows?
Assistant: On windows the user is not expected to configure an application using editable config files so there is no standard.
The standard for configuration which is editable using a GUI is the registry.
If you're using QT (or PyQT?) then you can use QSettings which provide an abstraction layer. On Linux it uses a config file and on windows is writes to the registry.
