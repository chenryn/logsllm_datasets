Question: "You are tasked with testing the security of a web application. During your assessment, you intend to identify potential entry and injection points. Which of the following approaches would allow you to accomplish this effectively?"
 "A": "Using an intercepting proxy to analyze GET and POST requests and pay special attention to parameters passed in the body of the requests, including hidden form fields."
 "B": "Focusing solely on the visual elements of the application's frontend to determine the possible entry points without analyzing the HTTP requests."
 "C": "Assuming all hidden form fields are secure by default and only concentrating on visible form fields and parameters."
 "D": "Ignoring GET requests since they are not commonly used to pass parameters and do not contribute to the application's attack surface."
Answer: A
