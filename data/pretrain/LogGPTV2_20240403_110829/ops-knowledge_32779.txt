User: When using windows MSI installation from python.org/download (current version is 2.7.3), python by default installs in some folder but it is nowhere documented what is this default. Can someone check that on windows?
Also does this MSI installation recognizes is it 32 or 64bit windows and installs appropriate version or it assumes that it shall always be 32bit version of python?
Particularly I am interested what happens on Windows 7 when this installer is used.
Assistant: the default installation folder is c:/python27
