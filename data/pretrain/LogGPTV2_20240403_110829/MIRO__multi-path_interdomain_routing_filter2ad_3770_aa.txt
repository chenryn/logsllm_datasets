ABSTRACT
The Internet consists of thousands of independent domains with
different, and sometimes competing, business interests. However,
the current interdomain routing protocol (BGP) limits each router
to using a single route for each destination preﬁx, which may not
satisfy the diverse requirements of end users. Recent proposals for
source routing offer an alternative where end hosts or edge routers
select the end-to-end paths. However, source routing leaves transit
domains with very little control and introduces difﬁcult scalability
and security challenges. In this paper, we present a multi-path inter-
domain routing protocol called MIRO that offers substantial ﬂexi-
bility, while giving transit domains control over the ﬂow of trafﬁc
through their infrastructure and avoiding state explosion in dissem-
inating reachability information.
In MIRO, routers learn default
routes through the existing BGP protocol, and arbitrary pairs of do-
mains can negotiate the use of additional paths (bound to tunnels
in the data plane) tailored to their special needs. MIRO retains the
simplicity of BGP for most trafﬁc, and remains backwards compat-
ible with BGP to allow for incremental deployability. Experiments
with Internet topology and routing data illustrate that MIRO offers
tremendous ﬂexibility for path selection with reasonable overhead.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet consists of thousands of independently administered
domains (or Autonomous Systems) that rely on the Border Gate-
way Protocol (BGP) to learn how to reach remote destinations. Al-
though BGP allows ASes to apply a wide range of routing policies,
the protocol requires each router to select a single “best” route for
each destination preﬁx from the routes advertised by its neighbors.
This leaves many ASes with little control over the paths their trafﬁc
takes. For example, an AS might want to avoid paths traversing an
AS known to have bad performance or ﬁlter data packets based on

represent the paths chosen to reach AS F. AS A does not want AS E
to carry its trafﬁc, but it has no choice because B and D have both
selected paths through E. Simply asking B to switch to the route
BCF is not an attractive solution, since this would not allow AS B
and its other neighbors to continue using BEF.
Recent research has considered several alternatives to single-
path routing, including source routing and overlay networks.
In
source routing, an end user or AS picks the entire path the pack-
ets traverse [1–5]. In overlay networks, packets can travel through
intermediate hosts to avoid performance or reliability problems on
the direct path [6]. However, these techniques do not give transit
ASes, such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), much control over
the trafﬁc traversing their networks. This control is important for
ASes to engineer their networks to run efﬁciently, and to maximize
revenue. The lack of control for ISPs is a signiﬁcant impediment
to the eventual adoption of source routing. In addition, both source
routing and overlay networks may not scale to a network the size
of the Internet. Instead, we explore an alternative solution where
the interdomain routing protocol supports multi-path routing, while
providing ﬂexible control for transit ASes and avoiding state explo-
sion in disseminating routing information.
Our solution is motivated by several observations about today’s
interdomain-routing system:
• Having each router select and advertise a single route for
each preﬁx is not ﬂexible enough to satisfy the diverse per-
formance and security requirements.
In Figure 1, today’s
routing system does not enable AS A to circumvent AS E
in sending trafﬁc to AS F.
• The existing routes chosen by BGP are sufﬁcient for a large
portion of the trafﬁc. In Figure 1, AS B and its other cus-
tomers may be perfectly happy with the path BEF.
• End users need control over the properties of the end-to-end
path, rather than complete control over which path is taken.
In Figure 1, AS A only wants to avoid AS E and does not
care about the rest of the path.
• The existing BGP protocol already provides many candidate
routes, although the alternate routes are not disseminated. In
Figure 1, AS B has learned the route BCF but simply has not
announced it to AS A.
• An AS selects routes based on business relationships with
neighboring domains, but might be willing to direct trafﬁc
to other paths, for a price.
In Figure 1, AS B may prefer
BEF for ﬁnancial reasons, but may be willing to send AS A’s
trafﬁc over BCF.
• Today’s Internet provides limited methods for one AS to in-
ﬂuence another AS’s choice. For example, if AS F is a multi-
homed stub AS which wants to control how much incoming
trafﬁc traverse link CF and EF respectively, it can only adver-
tise smaller preﬁxes or prepend its AS number [7]. However
those methods may be easily nulliﬁed by other ASes’ local
policy, making their effectiveness limited.
Inspired by these observations, we propose a multi-path interdo-
main routing protocol, called MIRO, with the following features:
• AS-level path selection: An AS represents an institution,
such as a university or company, and business relationships
are easily deﬁned at the AS level. This is simpler and more
scalable than giving each end user ﬁne-grain control over
path selection.
• Negotiation for alternate routes: An AS learns one route
from each neighbor and negotiates to learn alternate routes
as needed. This leads to a scalable solution that is backwards
compatible with BGP, and it also allows policy interaction
between arbitrary pairs of ASes.
• Policy-driven export of alternate routes: The responding
AS in the negotiation has control over which alternate paths,
if any, it announces in each step of the negotiation. This gives
transit ASes control over the trafﬁc entering their networks.
• Tunnels to direct trafﬁc on alternate paths: After a suc-
cessful negotiation, the two ASes establish the state needed
to forward data trafﬁc on the alternate route. The remaining
trafﬁc traverses the default route in the forwarding tables.
With the additional ﬂexibility, ASes could choose paths that sat-
isfy their special needs, for example:
• Avoiding a speciﬁc AS for security or performance reasons:
An AS can avoid sending sensitive data through a hostile
country or avoid an AS that often drops packets.
• Achieving higher performance: The AS can send trafﬁc through
more expensive inter-AS links that are normally not avail-
able, to achieve lower latency or higher bandwidth.
• Load balancing for incoming trafﬁc: A multi-homed AS try-
ing to balance load over multiple incoming links can request
that some upstream ASes use special AS paths to direct traf-
ﬁc over a different incoming link1.
1Analysis of RouteViews data [8] shows that 60% of the 20,000
ASes are multi-homed and more than 2000 are announcing smaller
subnets into BGP to exert control over incoming trafﬁc. However,
announcing small subnets increases routing-table size without pro-
viding precise control.

In designing MIRO, we separate policy and mechanism wher-
ever possible, to support a wide range of policies for interdomain
routing. Still, we present example policies and useful policy guide-
lines to illustrate the beneﬁts of adopting our protocol. In the next
section, we present background material on existing routing archi-
tectures. Then, Section 3 gives an overview of our main design
decisions. We describe MIRO in greater detail in Section 4 and
demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of MIRO in Section 5
using measurement data from RouteViews [8]. In Section 6 we dis-
cuss how ASes can conﬁgure ﬂexible routing policies. Section 7
discusses additional technical issues, such as routing-protocol con-
vergence and route aggregations. Section 8 presents related work,
and the paper concludes in Section 9.
2. ROUTING ARCHITECTURES
In this section, we present an overview of the current BGP pro-
tocol, source routing, and overlay networks. To simplify the dis-
cussion, we represent each AS as a single router, as illustrated in
Figure 2 where ﬁve ASes are selecting routes to a destination in
AS F. In BGP, each AS selects a single best route (indicated by
an asterisk) and advertises it to all neighbors. In source routing,
each end host has complete knowledge of the entire topology and
can choose whatever paths it wishes. In overlay networks, several
overlay nodes connect to the physical network to form a virtual
topology; each node can direct trafﬁc through other overlay nodes
en route to the destination.
2.1 Today’s Interdomain Routing
BGP [9], the de facto interdomain routing protocol for the Inter-
net, has several features that limit ﬂexibility in path selection:
• Destination-based: BGP distributes reachability information
about address blocks, and each router forwards a packet by
performing a longest-preﬁx match on the destination address.
As such, packets from different sources going through the
same router would follow the same downstream path.
• Single-path routing: A router learns at most one BGP route
from each neighbor and must select and advertise a single
“best” route. This limits the number of paths advertised and
poses severe restrictions on ﬂexibility.
• Path-vector protocol: In contrast to link-state protocols that
ﬂood topology information, BGP is a path-vector protocol
where routers learn only the AS paths advertised by their
neighbors. This improves scalability at the expense of vis-
ibility into the possible paths.
• Local-policy based: BGP gives each AS signiﬁcant ﬂexibil-
ity in deciding which routes to select and export. However,
the available routes depend on the composition of the local
policies in the downstream ASes, limiting the control each
AS has over path selection.
The local policies for selecting and exporting BGP routes de-
pend on the business relationships between neighboring ASes. The
most common relationships are customer-provider, peer, and sib-
ling [10–12].
In a customer-provider relationship, the customer
normally pays the provider for transit service; as such, the provider
announces the routes learned from any customer to all neighboring
ASes, but the customer normally only advertises the routes learned
from its provider to its own customers.
In a peer-peer relation-
ship, two ASes ﬁnd it mutually beneﬁcial to carry trafﬁc between
each other’s customers, often free of charge. Peering agreements
often indicate that the routes learned from a peer can only be ad-
vertised to customers. Sibling ASes typically belong to the same
institution, such as a large ISP, and provide transit service to each
other. Upon learning routes for a preﬁx from multiple neighbors, an
AS typically prefers to use customer-learned routes, then siblings,
then peers, and ﬁnally providers, to maximize revenue. At times,
though, providers deviate from these policy conventions upon cus-
tomer request (e.g., to provide backup connectivity for customers).
We believe that business incentives could also motivate an AS to
make alternate routes available to neighbors who have special per-
formance or security requirements.
Another problem in BGP is that an AS has limited inﬂuence over
the local policies in other ASes. Each AS prefers some paths over
others based on its own local goals. In some cases, an AS allows its
customers to inﬂuence these preferences by “tagging” the BGP an-
nouncements. However, these techniques are usually applied only
between adjacent ASes that unconditionally trust one another (e.g.,
a stub AS and its upstream ISP). In addition, the underlying mech-
anism is quite primitive—a simple tagging of routes without any
kind of “back and forth” negotiation between the two ASes.
2.2 Source Routing
In the past few years, several researchers have proposed source
routing as a way to provide greater ﬂexibility in path selection [1–
5]. In source routing, the end hosts or edge routers select the end-
to-end paths to the destinations. The data packets carry a list of the
hops in the path, or ﬂow identiﬁers that indicate how intermediate
routers should direct the trafﬁc. Although source routing maxi-
mizes ﬂexibility, several difﬁcult challenges remain:
• Limited control for intermediate ASes: Under source rout-
ing, intermediate ASes have very little control over how traf-
ﬁc enters and leaves their networks. This makes it difﬁcult
for intermediate ASes to engineer their networks and select
routes based on their own business goals, which is a barrier
to the deployment of source-routing schemes.
• Scalability: Source routing depends on knowledge of the net-
work topology, at some level of detail, for sources to compute
the paths. The volume of topology data, and the overhead for
computing paths, would be high, unless the data are aggre-
gated; including load or performance metrics, if necessary,
would further increase the overhead. In addition, the sources
must receive new topology information quickly when link or
router failures make the old paths invalid.
• Efﬁciency and stability: In source routing, end hosts or edge
routers adapt path selection based on application require-
ments and feedback about the state of the network. Although
source routing can generate good solutions in some cases [13],
a large number of selﬁsh sources selecting paths at the same
time may lead to suboptimal outcomes, or even instability.
Even if these challenges prove to be surmountable in practice, we
believe that it is valuable to consider other approaches that make
different trade-offs between ﬂexibility for the sources, control for
the intermediate ASes, and scalability of the overall system.
2.3 Overlay Networks
In overlay networks, several end hosts form a virtual topology on
top of the existing Internet [6]. When the direct path through the
underlying network has performance or reliability problems, the
sending node can direct trafﬁc through an intermediate node. The
trafﬁc then travels on the path from the source to the intermediate
node, followed by the path from the intermediate node to the des-
tination. Although overlay networks are useful for circumventing
problems along the direct path, they are not a panacea for support-
ing ﬂexible path selection at scale, for several reasons:
• Data-plane overhead: Sending trafﬁc through an intermedi-
ate host increases latency, and consumes bandwidth on the
edge link in and out of that host. In addition, the data packets
must be encapsulated to direct trafﬁc through the host, which
consumes extra bandwidth in the underlying network.
• Limited control: The overlay network has no control over the
