Mars to Earth, that the UFOs might be using the planets as launching bases, 
and predicted a wave of UFO reports in mid-October. 
In late September or early October, 1948, the Estimate was approved by 
Colonels William Clingerman and Howard McCoy (Sneider’s superiors), 
who then submitted it to the office of General Charles Cabell, the chief of 
Air Force intelligence. 
According to Swords The Pentagon  went into an “uproar” over the 
Estimate, which generated “intense” debate. Cabell was newly-appointed, 
and found himself in charge of a “split house:” some were sympathetic and 
intrigued, if not entirely convinced of the Estimate’s accuracy, while others 
rejected the very idea of interplanetary saucers as impossible. Unsure of how 
to proceed, Cabell eventually submitted the Estimate to his superior, General 
Hoyt Vandenberg, Chief-of-Staff of the U.S. Air Force. 
According to Ruppelt, the Estimate was rejected by Vandenberg primarily 
due to lack of supporting physical evidence, and was “batted back down” the 
chain of command. 
In a letter dated November 3, 1948, Cabell wrote to Sign, via McCoy, 
describing flying saucers as real, but rejecting the interplanetary hypothesis 
and asking for another Estimate. Cabell wrote: 
The conclusion appears inescapable that some type of flying object 
has been observed. Identification and the origin of these objects is not 
discernible to this Headquarters. It is imperative, therefore, that efforts 
to determine whether these objects are of domestic or foreign origin 
must be increased until conclusive evidence is obtained. The needs of 
national defense require such evidence in order that appropriate 
countermeasures may be taken. 
McCoy responded in a somewhat defensive letter dated November 8, 1948. 
He noted that many of the UFO reports were misidentified everyday 
phenomena), but also restated the rejected ideas of the Estimate without 
explicitly endorsing the interplanetary hypothesis; as Swords 
writes,”[Project Sign] just had their knuckles rapped, so they defended 
themselves.” McCoy wrote, 
...there remains a certain number of reports for which no reasonable 
everyday explanation is available. So far, no physical evidence of the 
existence of the unidentified sightings has been obtained... 
The possibility that the reported objects are vehicles from another 
planet has not been ignored. However, tangible evidence to support 
conclusions about such a possibility are completely lacking... 
When Sign personnel refused to abandon the interplanetary hypothesis, 
many were reassigned, and Sign was renamed Project Grudge in 1949.  
(photographs from gun cameras and civilians (e.g. Trent in McMinnville 
Oregon), movie film – not evidence.) According to Ruppelt, “The estimate 
died a quick death. Some months later it was completely declassified and 
relegated to the incinerator. A few copies, one of which I saw, were kept as 
mementos of the golden days of the UFO’s.” 
The first public report of the Estimate was in Captain Edward J. Ruppelt’s 
1956 book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. He wrote: 
In intelligence, if you have something to say about some vital problem 
you write a report that is known as an “Estimate of the Situation.” A 
few days after the Chiles-Whitted UFO report, the people at ATIC 
decided that the time had arrived to make an Estimate of the Situation. 
The situation was the UFO’s; the estimate was that they were 
interplanetary! 
It was a rather thick document with a black cover and it was printed 
on legal sized paper. Stamped across the front were the words Top 
Secret.  It contained the Air Force’s analysis of many of the [UFO] 
incidents I have told you about plus many similar ones. All of them 
had come from scientists, pilots, and other equally credible 
observers, and each one was an unknown ... “ When the estimate 
was completed, typed, and approved, it started up through channels to 
higher command echelons. It drew considerable comment but no one 
stopped it on its way up. 
No copies of this near-legendary document have surfaced since. 
Ruppelt’s 1956 book, which first publicly disclosed the Estimate, was 
cleared by the Air Force. Clark writes (Clark, 1998), that as late as 1960, Air 
Force officials denied that the Estimate was real, despite the fact that censors 
had approved Ruppelt’s book a few years before. 
According to Clark, the Estimate’s existence was confirmed by U.S. Air 
Force Major Dewey J. Fournet, who as an Air Force major in the Pentagon 
served as liaison with official UFO project headquartered at Wright-Pat.” 
(Clark, 178) Fournet has been described as being “unimpressed” with the 
Estimate, and was furthermore quoted as describing the ET conclusion as an 
“extreme extrapolation” based on scant evidence. 
An Air Force consultant, astronomer Dr. Allen Hynek,  also verified the 
Estimate’s existence. (Hynek, 1973) 
2. Ruppelt – The least unlikely explanation for UFOs is the extraterrestrial, 
3.  1950 Wilbert Smith, a scientist at the Canadian Department of 
Transport, learned through “direct inquiries” through the Canadian embassy 
in Washington that “flying saucers exist and were the most highly classified 
subject in the United States government, rating higher even than the H-
bomb.” 
4. The Robertson Panel was a committee commissioned by the CIA in 1952  
in response to widespread reports, especially in the DC area. The panel was 
briefed on U.S. military activities and intelligence, hence the report was 
originally classified Secret. 
Later declassified, the Robertson Panel's report concluded that UFOs were 
not a direct threat to national security, but could pose an indirect threat by 
overwhelming standard military communications due to public interest in the 
subject. Most UFO reports, they concluded, could be explained as 
misidentification of mundane aerial objects, and the remaining minority 
could, in all likelihood, be similarly explained with further study. 
The Robertson Panel concluded that a PR campaign should be 
undertaken in order to "debunk” UFOs, and reduce public interest in 
the subject, and that civilian UFO groups should be monitored. There is 
evidence this is was carried out more than two decades after the Panel's 
conclusion; see "publicity and responses" below. 
Critics (including a few panel members) would later lament the Robertson 
Panel's role in making UFOs a somewhat disreputable field of study. 
In 1952, there was a wave of UFO reports in the United States, especially 
centered around Washington DC.. In response, so many civilians contacted 
various government agencies regarding UFO reports that daily governmental 
duties were impacted; the NY Times reported on 8/1/52 that "regular 
intelligence work has been affected." There was a general concern among 
the military that the hysteria and confusion generated by UFO reports could 
be utilized by the United States' enemies, primarily the Soviet Union.. 
The Air Force had earlier commissioned the Battelle Memorial Institute to 
scientifically study the various UFO reports collected by Sign, Grudge, and 
Blue Book. but Battelle insisted they needed more time to conduct a proper 
study. The CIA thought the question so pressing that they authorized a 
committee in late 1952. 
The Robertson Panel first met formally on Jan 14 1953 under the direction 
of Howard Percy Robinson, a physicist, CIA employee and director of the 
DOD Weapons Evaluation Group. 
The Panel had four consecutive days of formal meetings; in total, they met 
for about 12 hours. 
The first day, they viewed two amateur motion pictures of UFOs: the 
Mariana UFO incident and the 1952 Utah UFRO film (the latter was taken 
by Navy Chief Petty Officer Delbert C. Newhouse, who had extensive 
experience with aerial photography). Two Navy photograph and film 
analysts (Lieutenants R.S. Neasham and Harry Woo) then reported their 
conclusions: based on more than 1000 man hours of detailed analysis, the 
two films depicted objects that were not any known aircraft, creature or 
weather phenomena. Air Force Captain Ruppelt then began a summary of 
Air Force efforts regarding UFO studies. 
The second day, Ruppelt finished his presentation. Hynek then discussed the 
Battelle study, and the panel discussed with Air Force personnel the 
problems inherent in monitoring UFO sightings.  
The third day, Air Force Major Dewey J. Fournet spoke to the panel; for 
over a year he had coordinated UFO affairs for the Pentagon. Fournett 
supported the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the best explanation for some 
puzzling UFO reports. For the remainder of the third day, the panel 
discussed their conclusions, and Robertson agreed to draft a preliminary 
report. 
The fourth and final day, the panel rewrote and finalized their report. 
The Robertson Panel's official report concluded that 90 percent of UFO 
sightings could be readily identified with meteorological, astronomical, or 
natural phenomena, and that the remaining 10 percent of UFO reports could, 
in all likelihood, be similarly explained with detailed study. However, the 
Panel's conclusions also seemingly ignored eyewitness testimony in film 
cases that the objects filmed, while closer to the camera operators, were 
clearly-defined metallic flying saucers, not the rather indistinct lights 
seen on the films. 
Furthermore, the Panel suggested the Air Force should begin a "debunking” 
effort to reduce "public gullibility" and demystify UFO reports, partly via a 
PR campaign, using psychiatrists, astronomers, and assorted celebrities to 
significantly reduce public interest in UFOs. It was also recommended that 
the mass media be used for the debunking, including influential media giants 
like the Disney.. The primary reasoning for this recommendation lay in the 
belief that the Soviets might try to "mask" an actual invasion of the USA by 
causing a wave of false "UFO" reports to swamp the Pentagon and other 
military agencies, thus temporarily blinding the US government to the 
impending Communist invasion. 
Their formal recommendation stated "That the national security agencies 
take immediate steps to strip the Unidentified Flying Objects of the special 
status they have been given and the aura of mystery they have unfortunately 
acquired."  
Also recommended was government monitoring of civilian groups 
studying or researching UFOs "because of their potentially great 
influence on mass thinking ... the apparent irresponsibility and possible 
use of such groups for subversive purposes should be kept in mind."  
Ruppelt's 1956 book The Report On unidentified Flying Objects contained 
the first publicly-released information about the Robertson Panel, with a 
summary of their proceedings and conclusions 
Panel member Thornton Page would later change some of his more 
stridently skeptical conclusions regarding the Panel's report, and regarding 
UFOs in general. In his 1969 critique of the Condon Report, Page would 
lament the "excessive levity" he brought to the Panel's proceeding, detailing 
how he later thought the UFO subject deserved serious scrutiny.  
Hynek's opinions changed in later years as well, so much that he became, to 
many, the scientifically respectable voice of UFOlogy. He would lament that 
the Robertson Panel had "made the subject of UFOs scientifically 
unrespectable, and for nearly 20 years not enough attention was paid to the 
subject to acquire the kind of data needed even to decide the nature of the 
UFO phenomenon." 
According to Swords[, the Robertson Panel's report had an "enormous" 
impact throughout the U.S. Government: the CIA abandoned a "major high 
level [UFO] investigation" planned in conjunction with the NSC. UFO 
research projects by personnel in the Pentagon were quashed; and Project 
Blue Book's hopes to establish a scientific advisory board were dashed. Blue 
Book was also downgraded in status and stripped of most responsibility for 
investigating serious, well-attested UFO cases, which were instead secretly 
turned over to a newly-formed division of the Air Defense Command. 
Directives were also issued not to discuss the unexplainable cases with the 
public and to reduce the percentage of "unknowns" 
Though the CIA's official history suggests that the Robertson Panel's 
conclusions were never carried out, there is evidence that contradicts this. 
Perhaps the most unambiguous evidence for the Robertson Panel's covert 
impact on news media reporting about UFOs is a personal letter by Dr. 
Thornton, discovered in the Smithsonian archives by biochemist Swords.  
The 1966 letter, addressed to former Robertson Panel Secretary Frederick 
Durant. which confides that Page "helped organize the CBS TV show 
around the Robertson Panel conclusions." Page was no doubt referring to the 
CBS Reports TV broadcast of the same year, "UFOs: Friend, Foe, or 
Fantasy?" narrated by Water Cronkite. (Incidentally, this program was 
criticized for inaccurate and misleading presentations). Page's letter indicates 
that the Robertson Panel was still putting a negative spin on UFO news at 
least 13 years after the panel met. 
Furthermore, according to Swords[, there is ample evidence to prove that 
CSI was pressured to disband by the U.S. Government. FBI documents 
indicate that noted engineer Walter Riedel was pressured to resign from CSI, 
and not long afterwards, the group disbanded; in response, Robertson wrote 
to Marshall Chadwell, stating "[t]hat ought to fix the Forteans.”  (Robertson 
was referring to the devotees of American writer Charles Fort, (1874-1932), 
whose books argued in favor of the reality of extraterrestrial on Earth.)  
Some scholars have suggested that the Robertson Panel's true objective was 
to justify a CIA domestic propaganda-and-surveillance campaign, rather 
than to investigate UFOs. Journalist Howard Blum writes that it is difficult 
to accept any argument that the Robertson Panel was ever intended as a 
serious scientific analysis: for example, the Panel's perfunctory rejection of 
the U.S. Navy's detailed examination of the UFO films is all but impossible 
to justify on scientific grounds. Similarly, Swords has argued that the Panel 
seems to have been designed as an elaborate theater exercise instead of a 
serious attempt to get to the bottom of the UFO issue. Although the Panel 
put on a show of evaluating some UFO evidence, its scientific analysis was 
cursory and its conclusions mostly likely pre-ordained. Also, the Panel only 
looked only at evidence in the public domain, not higher-quality classified 
military evidence. Psychologist David R. Saunders, a member of the 
University of Colorado's UFO study (the Condon Committee), had earlier 
expressed similar conclusions. Given that Robertson had worked as a high-
level scientific-intelligence officer during World War II, he would have been 
familiar with the use of such tactics to hide a sensitive national-security 
problem from scrutiny by outsiders. 
The Robertson Panel's conclusions and recommendations had a great 
influence on official United States policy regarding UFOs for many decades. 
When the Battelle Memorial Institute finally finished their massive review 
of Air Force UFO cases in 1954 (called "Project Blue Book Special Report 
No. 14"), their results were markedly different from those of the Robertson 
Panel. Whereas the Robertson Panel spent only twelve hours reviewing a 
limited number of cases, the Battelle Institute had four full-time scientific 
analysts working for over two years analyzing 3201 reports. Classifying a 
case as "unknown" required agreement among all four analysts, whereas a 
"known" or conventional classification required agreement by only two 
analysts. Still they concluded 22% of the cases remained unsolvable. The 
percentage climbed to 35% when considering only the best cases and fell to 
18% for the worst cases. Not only are the percentages of unknowns much 
higher than those for the Robertson Panel, but the higher percentages for the 
better cases are directly opposite one conclusion of the panel that their 
remaining 10% of unknowns would disappear if further investigated and 
more information was available. Furthermore, the Battelle study had already 
thrown out cases they deemed to have insufficient information to make a 
determination (9% of all cases). Thus, the fact that a case was classified as 
"unknown" had nothing to do with lack of information or investigation. 
The study also looked at six characteristics of the sightings: duration, speed, 
number, brightness, color, and shape. For all characteristics, the knowns and 
unknowns differed at a highly statistically significant level, further 
indicating that the knowns and unknowns were distinctly different classes of 
phenomena. 
Despite this, the summary section of the final report declared it was "highly 
improbable that any of the reports of unidentified aerial objects... represent 
observations of technological developments outside the range of present-day 
knowledge." A number of researchers have noted that the conclusions of the 
analysts were usually at odds with their own statistical results, displayed in 
240 charts, tables, graphs and maps. Possibly the analysts simply had trouble 
accepting their own results. Others conjecture this was another result of the 
Robertson Panel, the conclusions being written to satisfy the new political 
climate within Project Blue Book following the panel. 
Project Blue Book 
Project Blue Book was one of a series of systematic studies of UFOs conducted by the 
Air Force. Started in 1952, it was the second revival of such a study. A termination order 
was given for the study in December 1969, and all activity under its auspices ceased in 
January 1970. 
Project Blue Book had two goals: to determine if UFOs were a threat to national security, 
and to scientifically analyse UFO-related data. Thousands of UFO reports were collected, 
analyzed and filed. As the result of the Condon Report, which concluded there was 
nothing anomalous about any UFOs, Project Blue Book was ordered shut down in 
December 1969. This project was the last publicly known UFO research project led by 
the USAF.[1] 
By the time Project Blue Book ended, it had collected 12,618 UFO reports, and 
concluded that most of them were misidentifications of natural phenomena (clouds, stars, 
et cetera) or conventional aircraft. A few were considered hoaxes. 701 of the reports —- 
about six percent —- were classified as unknowns, defying detailed analysis. 
Though many accepted Blue Book's final conclusions that there was nothing 
extraordinary about UFOs, critics -— then and now —- have charged that Blue Book,
