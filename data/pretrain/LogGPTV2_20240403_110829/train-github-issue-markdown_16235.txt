Hi community,
Now the subproject `examples` has used the `flatten-maven-plugin` to reduce
duplicate version declarations (since #13512).  
It is valuable, otherwise we still have to change a lot of version numbers
during release (like this #21625)
Therefore, I am going to use `${revision}` to define the version number in the
same way for ShardingSphere, to facilitate maintenance.
