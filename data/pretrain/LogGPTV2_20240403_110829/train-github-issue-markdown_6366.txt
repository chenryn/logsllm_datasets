I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

## Expected Behavior
After running `npm i material-ui-codemod`, I expected to find the following files:
- `node_modules/material-ui-codemod/lib/v1.0.0/svg-icon-imports`

## Current Behavior
The directory `node_modules/material-ui-codemod/lib/v1.0.0/svg-icon-imports` is missing.

Thank you for your attention!
