Hello,

I'm encountering an issue while using Glide to load images from a URL. Here is the code I am using:

```java
Glide.with(this).load(url).placeholder(R.drawable.img_photo_fail).into(imageView);
```

Initially, the `ImageView` displays the placeholder image instead of the actual image from the URL. However, if I navigate back and then re-enter the activity, the correct image loads properly.

Interestingly, when I use Glide without specifying a placeholder, like this:

```java
Glide.with(this).load(url).into(imageView);
```

the image loads correctly without any issues.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this problem? Thank you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
