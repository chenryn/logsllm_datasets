Hello ,  
when i use glide to load url picture, just like
        Glide.with(this).load(url).placeholder(R.drawable.img_photo_fail).into(imageview);
I find that the imageview shows the placeholder's pic instead of the url's pic
at first .  
and I click back and come in again , it's rgiht .
and if I use glide like this
       Glide.with(this).load(url).into(imageview);  
without placehold . It can work well .
What can I do ? thank you .
