ABSTRACT
The Internet’s inter-domain routing infrastructure, provided today by
BGP, is extremely rigid and does not facilitate the introduction of new
inter-domain routing protocols. This rigidity has made it incredibly
difficult to widely deploy critical fixes to BGP. It has also depressed
ASes’ ability to sell value-added services or replace BGP entirely
with a more sophisticated protocol. Even if operators undertook the
significant effort needed to fix or replace BGP, it is likely the next
protocol will be just as difficult to change or evolve. To help, this
paper identifies two features needed in the routing infrastructure
(i.e., within any inter-domain routing protocol) to facilitate evolution
to new protocols. To understand their utility, it presents D-BGP, a
version of BGP that incorporates them.

INTRODUCTION
1
The Internet’s inter-domain routing infrastructure is a critical com-
ponent of its architecture. The routing paths it computes and dissem-
inates in the control plane allow us to access all of the services and
content that we hold dear. Today, this infrastructure is provided by a
single inter-domain routing protocol—the Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP)—which is plagued with problems. It does not provide domains
sufficient influence to limit the amount of traffic they receive [18];
its paths are slow to converge and prone to oscillations [33]; it in-
discriminately chooses a single best-effort path per router, robbing
other domains of paths they may prefer more [63]; and it is prone

to numerous attacks, including prefix hijacking and traffic intercep-
tion [47]. Worst of all, BGP is architecturally rigid [20]—it requires
direct neighbors to use the same inter-domain routing protocol—and
thus cannot facilitate the deployment of new inter-domain routing
protocols.
This rigidity has made widespread adoption of the numerous criti-
cal fixes to BGP proposed by the operator and research communities
incredibly difficult. Examples include adding awareness of path costs
to limit incoming traffic to domains [32], adding backup paths to
reduce convergence times [29], and adding secure path announce-
ments via BGPSec [8] to prevent prefix hijacking. It has also prevented
BGP from being replaced altogether with more sophisticated pro-
tocols that are more suited for today’s Internet. Examples include
path-based routing [61, 63] to offer source domains more control
over path selection and multi-hop routing to additionally allow for
rich policies [19,21]. Finally, it has depressed ISPs’ ability to sell value-
added services, such as differentiated QoS [36] or alternate paths [60],
to combat their ever-increasing commoditization.
BGP’s rigidity stifles innovation because it makes it more diffi-
cult for the Internet’s routing infrastructure to change or evolve. It
mandates that new protocols be deployed within isolated islands
(groups of contiguous domains) that cannot discover one another,
disseminate new protocols’ information to one another, or benefit
from using the new protocol to route traffic amongst themselves. One
workaround that can be used to circumvent BGP’s rigidity is to use
an overlay to forcibly (i.e., without support from BGP) route traffic to
domains that have deployed a desired new protocol [36,49,60]. But,
this approach has significant drawbacks. Most notably, the tunnels
an overlay uses to hide traffic’s true destinations from domains that
have not yet deployed the new protocol interfere with those domains’
routing decisions and thus can significantly increase their operating
costs. This can disincentivize them from supporting evolution. Even
if operators undertook the massive effort necessary to upgrade or
replace BGP, it is likely that the new protocol would be as difficult to
upgrade.
The goal of this paper is to identify what features are needed in any
inter-domain routing protocol (i.e., within the routing infrastructure)
to bootstrap evolution to new inter-domain routing protocols—i.e.,
facilitate their deployment across non-contiguous domains and, if
desired, gradually replace itself in favor of one of them. By incorporat-
ing the evolvability features, these new protocols would themselves
be able to bootstrap evolvability to further new protocols. We present
Darwin’s BGP (D-BGP), a version of BGP extended with these fea-
tures to understand the difficulty of incorporating them in a specific
existing inter-domain routing protocol. We use D-BGP to illustrate
our evolvability features’ utility in enabling evolution. D-BGP’s ex-
tensions could also be added to a secure protocol (e.g., BGPSec [8]).

The evolvability features we identify—pass-through support within
routers and multi-protocol advertisements—reduce rigidity by cleanly
separating the information contained in protocols’ connectivity ad-
vertisements from that used by their path-selection algorithms. This
allows protocols’ advertisements to become containers that can dis-
seminate multiple other protocols’ control information and facilitate
discovery across islands. Loop freeness is guaranteed by requiring all
protocols to use the same loop avoidance mechanism. Our evolvabil-
ity features do not require overlays, elevating whether they are used
to be a protocol-specific consideration.
Our experiences indicate it is easy to implement D-BGP and de-
ploy new protocols using it. Though we cannot claim D-BGP can
facilitate the introduction of all new protocols, it is sufficient to boot-
strap evolvability to a wide range of critical BGP fixes, value-added
services, and multi-hop-based or path-based replacements (see Sec-
tion 2). It can also foster innovation by facilitating a rich Internet
comprised of multiple disparate protocols (e.g., multi-hop-based and
path-based ones). Simulations show that, compared to BGP, D-BGP
incentivizes adoption of new protocols by accelerating the rate at
which adopters see those protocols’ benefits. The benefits afforded
at any adoption level vary depending on the type of protocol. We
leave a thorough discussion of how D-BGP itself could be deployed
to future work.
We present the following contributions:
1) Based on an analysis of 14 recently proposed inter-domain rout-
ing protocols, we identify evolvability features any inter-domain
routing protocol should provide to bootstrap evolvability to vari-
ous critical fixes to it or entirely new inter-domain routing proto-
cols.
2) We describe the design of D-BGP, a version of BGPv4 [44] that
incorporates the needed evolvability features. We describe our
experiences implementing a D-BGP proof-of-concept, called
Beagle, in an open-source router [39].
3) Via MiniNeXT-based [50] experiments using Beagle, we show
that deploying two new protocols (Wiser [32] and Pathlet Rout-
ing [21]) using D-BGP requires only 255-293 lines of per-protocol
code modifications.
4) Via simulation, we analyze how well D-BGP accelerates bene-
fits for different types of new protocols. We show that D-BGP’s
control-plane overheads are modest (between 1.3x and 2.5x) even
when supporting hundreds of critical BGP fixes and sophisti-
cated replacements. This is because many critical BGP fixes can
share protocol-specific control information with BGP.
2 TOWARD AN EVOLVABLE INTERNET
The evolvable Internet we envision will use multiple inter-domain
routing protocols, many of which will only be partially deployed. This
is because domains or ASes will naturally update to new protocols at
different timescales and because different domains may want to use
different protocols (e.g., to provide different value-added services).
To ensure global connectivity, we assume all ASes will share one
inter-domain routing protocol, called the baseline. The baseline could
be a one-way protocol that disseminates its control information in
path advertisements upstream from destinations to sources. Alterna-
tively, it could be a two-way protocol that sends additional control
information downstream from destinations to sources (e.g., to refine
path selection). We assume the baseline (and all future baselines)
will be based on path vector to allow ASes the flexibility to make
independent routing decisions. Today’s baseline is BGP, a one-way,
path-vector protocol.
In this evolvable Internet, islands name a cluster of one or more
contiguous ASes that support the same protocol. Gulfs name the set
of ASes separating two islands. These ASes do not support the same
protocol as the islands they separate, but do support the baseline and
possibly others. ASes may use distributed control (i.e., individual
routers advertise and choose paths) or centralized control (i.e., single
entities within each AS advertise and choose paths). When discussing
the deployment of a new routing protocol, we will sometimes refer to
islands and ASes in gulfs as upgraded islands and gulf ASes for clarity.
This Internet may use multiple network protocols in the data plane
to forward packets, either because it is evolving its address format
(e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6) or because different network
protocols are used by different routing protocols (e.g., path-based for-
warding, used by SCION, and hop-based forwarding, used by BGP).
As a result, traffic that crosses gulfs may need to be encapsulated with
multiple network protocols’ headers in the data plane. We call such
headers multi-network-protocol headers.
To understand what evolvability features are needed in the routing
infrastructure (i.e., within any inter-domain routing protocol) to
facilitate this evolvable Internet, we analyzed 14 recently-proposed
protocols from the research and operator communities [1,6,8,17,19,
21,29,32,36,53,59–61,63]. Our goal was to systematize what support
they would need to be deployed across gulfs. We found that we could
map the protocols into three distinct evolvability scenarios that differ
in their goals, needed control-plane and data-plane support, and
operators’ incentives for supporting them (see Table 1 for a summary).
These differences informed scenario-specific requirements that any
features for enabling evolvability must satisfy.
In this section, we first discuss an important data-plane issue that
can arise in an evolvable Internet and then introduce the evolvability
scenarios. Since our scenarios focus on recently-proposed protocols,
we assume the baseline is BGP when discussing them.
2.1 Routing compliance
Figure 1 illustrates a simple version of our evolvable Internet. In this
figure, a source S wants to communicate with destination D using
a new inter-domain protocol that is only partially deployed (ignore
Wiser-specific information, which will be discussed later). Arrows
show the direction of path advertisements. Note that traffic from S to
D can use routing paths that traverse islands that support the new
protocol (shown in grey) and ASes in gulfs that do not support it
(shown in white). In an evolvable Internet, routing compliance refers
to the degree to which such paths are compliant with the goals and
policies of the new, but only partially deployed, protocol.
Reduced routing compliance can limit or obviate the benefits of
using a new protocol to deliver traffic. Protocols that aim to expose
extra within-island information, such as extra intra-island paths,
are least sensitive to reduced compliance. In contrast, protocols that
aim to optimize some global objective function, such as bottleneck
bandwidth, security, or latency will be more sensitive because the
limiting variable (e.g., the bottleneck) may be within gulf ASes. The
extent of a protocol’s sensitivity to reduced compliance depends on
the objective function it aims to optimize.
