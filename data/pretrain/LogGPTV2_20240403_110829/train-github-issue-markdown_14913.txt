It would be great to be able to have a custom checksum validator that can
ignore certain branches of the DOM-tree when attempting to reuse markup.
The use case is for rendering static components. For static components that
only need to be rendered once, we can just do the rendering on the server, and
not have to render again on the client. Currently we have to pass down both
the react markup AND the props used to generate the static markup. However, it
is a waste to send those props down, if this component doesn't need to be
rendered client-side.
One of the major performance concerns for using React is that apps not only
have to send down markup but props as well, usually duplicating the data sent
down to the client.
Being able to specify certain components as not needing a client side re-
render, thus skipping check-sum, would save k-weight of the initial page load.
