I am using Webpack 2 beta21 in some setup where I am trying to combine
`System.import` auto chunks + HMR + SSR React. I am currently struggle with
how to use modules in es2015 module syntax (as suggested by
`module`/`jsnext:main` entries). As far as I understand I have to transpile
that code. But normally we do not transpile any code from `node_modules`,
correct? So how can I do that "basic" transpilation that I have a non-module
output from all these different sources?
