Abstract. Many Internet customers use network address translation (NAT) when
connecting to the Internet. To understand the extend of NAT usage and its impli-
cations, we explore NAT usage in residential broadband networks based on ob-
servations from more than 20,000 DSL lines. We present a unique approach for
detecting the presence of NAT and for estimating the number of hosts connected
behind a NAT gateway using IP TTLs and HTTP user-agent strings. Furthermore,
we study when each of the multiple hosts behind a single NAT gateway is active.
This enables us to detect simultaneous use. In addition, we evaluate the accuracy
of NAT analysis techniques when fewer information is available.
We ﬁnd that more than 90 % of DSL lines use NAT gateways to connect to the
Internet and that 10 % of DSL lines have multiple hosts that are active at the same
time. Overall, up to 52 % of lines have multiple hosts. Our ﬁndings point out that
using IPs as host identiﬁers may introduce substantial errors and therefore should
be used with caution.
1 Introduction
Today, network address translation (NAT) is commonly used when residential users
connect their computers and laptops to the Internet. Indeed, most ISPs typically offer
WiFi-enabled NAT home gateways to their broadband customers. These NAT gateways
enable customers to easily and swiftly connect several devices to the Internet while
needing only one public IP address. The prevalence of NAT devices and the number
of terminals connected through a NAT gateway thus has implications on whether a
public IP address can be used as a unique host identiﬁer and if it is possible to estimate
population sizes, e.g., malware infections, using IP addresses.
We, in this paper, analyze residential NAT usage based on anonymized packet-level
traces covering more than 20,000 DSL lines from a major European ISP. We exam-
ine the number of DSL lines using NAT and how many distinct devices or hosts are
connected via such NAT gateways. Furthermore, for DSL lines showing evidence of
activity by more than one host we also study if these hosts are used concurrently.
While common wisdom holds that NAT is widely used in residential networks and
that IP addresses are problematic end-host identiﬁers, no recent study reported num-
bers on NAT penetration or quantiﬁed the error potential in IP–to–end-host mappings.
Most previous studies on identifying NAT gateways and inferring the number of hosts
behind such gateways rely on information available in the packet headers, e. g., IPIDs,
IP TTLs, or ports. Our approach takes advantage of HTTP user-agent information in

addition to IP TTLs. In 2002, Bellovin [2] proposed and discussed the possibility to
identify end-hosts by leveraging the fact that IPIDs are usually implemented as a sim-
ple counter. He found that this approach is limited in its applicability. Nowadays some
IP-stacks even implement random IPIDs, further reducing the applicability of this ap-
proach. Beverly [3] evaluated several techniques to perform TCP/IP ﬁngerprinting and
found a host count inﬂation due to NAT by 9 % based on a one hour trace from 2004.
Phaal [10] also takes advantage of the IP TTL. Furthermore, there is work in the area
of OS ﬁngerprinting, e. g., Miller [7].
Armitage [1] performed a measurement study in 2002 by offering Quake III servers
at well connected Internet sites and monitoring the incoming connections. He identiﬁed
NATed players by checking for non-default Quake client ports and found that 17–25 %
of the players where located behind a NAT. Xie et al. [11] track IP-to-host bindings
over time for counting hosts. However, they consider all hosts behind a NAT gateway
as a single host. Casado et al. [4] use active web content to analyze NAT usage and IP
address churn. By comparing local to public IP addresses they ﬁnd that 5–10 % of IPs
contacting the monitored web services have multiple hosts over a 7 month period.
In previous work [5] we showed that many distinct IP addresses are assigned to the
same DSL line and that IP addresses cannot be used to reliably identify end hosts.
While Casado et al. [4] found relatively low IP address churn, Xie et al. [12] came to a
similar conclusion as we. In this paper we show that the situation is even worse because
multiple hosts share one of these ﬂuctuating IP addresses using NAT.
Our analysis of NAT usage shows that roughly 90 % of the studied lines connect to
the Internet via a NAT gateway, presenting a high potential for IP ambiguity. Indeed, in
our 24 h data sets 30–52 % of the DSL lines host multiple end-hosts. When considering
shorter observation periods, 20 % of the DSL lines show activity from two or more
hosts at least once within 1 hour. Even with time-frames as short as 1 sec, 10 % of the
DSL lines show activity from multiple hosts. These results emphasize the large error
potential of techniques that rely on an IP address to uniquely identify an end-host.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: We describe our data sets in
Section 2 and explain our methodology in Section 3. Next, we present our results on
NAT usage and the number of hosts in Section 4 and the impact of shorter time-scales in
Section 5. We then critically discuss our ﬁndings in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.
2 Data Sets
We base our study on multiple sets of anonymized packet-level observations of resi-
dential DSL connections collected at a large European ISP. Data anonymization and
classiﬁcation is performed immediately on the secured measurement infrastructure.
Overall, the ISP has roughly 11.5 million (4%) of the 283 million worldwide broad-
band subscribers [8]. They predominantly use DSL. The monitor, using Endace moni-
toring cards, operates at the broadband access router connecting customers to the ISP’s
backbone. Our vantage point allows us to observe more than 20,000 DSL lines. The
anonymized packet-level traces are annotated with anonymized DSL line card port-
IDs. This enables us to uniquely distinguish DSL lines since IP addresses are subject to
churn and as such cannot be used to identify DSL lines [5]. While we typically do not

experience any packet loss, there are several multi-second periods with no packets (less
than 5 minutes overall per trace) due to OS/ﬁle-system interactions. Table 1 summarizes
characteristics of the traces we used for our analysis, including the trace start, duration,
and size.
3 Methodology
To analyze NAT usage among residential customers we have to (i) identify lines that
use a NAT gateway (e. g., a home router) to connect to the Internet and (ii) differentiate
between the hosts behind the NAT gateway.
3.1 Detecting the Presence of NAT
To detect whether NAT is used on a DSL line, we utilize the fact that OSes networking
stacks use well-deﬁned initial IP TTL values (ttlinit) in outgoing packets (e. g., Windows
uses 128, MacOS uses 64). Furthermore, we know that our monitoring point is at a well
deﬁned hop distance (one IP-level hop) from the customers’ equipment. Since NAT
devices do routing they decrement the TTLs for each packet that passes through them.
We note that some NAT implementations might not decrement the TTL, however, per
Section 6, we do not ﬁnd evidence that such gateways are used by our user population
in signiﬁcant numbers.
These observations enable us to infer the presence of NAT based on the TTL values
of packets sent by customers. If the TTL is ttlinit − 1 the sending host is directly con-
nected to the Internet (as the monitoring point is one hop away from the customer). If the
TTL is ttlinit − 2 then there is a routing device (i. e., a NAT gateway) in the customers’
premises.
We note that users could reconﬁgure their systems to use a different TTL. However,
we do not expect this to happen often. Indeed, we do ﬁnd that almost all observed
TTLs are between ttlinit − 1 and ttlinit − 3. While there are some packets with TTL
values outside these ranges, they contribute less than 1.9 % of packets (1.7 % of bytes).
Moreover, approximately half of those are due to IPSEC which uses a TTL of 255 and
no other TTL has more than 0.44 % of packets. Given the low number of such packets,
we discard them for our NAT detection.
A NAT gateway can come in one of two ways. It can be a dedicated gateway (e. g.,
a home-router) or it can be a regular desktop or notebook, that has Internet connection

sharing activated. A dedicated NAT gateway will often directly interact with Internet
services, e. g., by serving as DNS resolver for the local network or for synchronizing its
time with NTP servers. Moreover, they generally do not surf the Web or use HTTP.
3.2 Number of Hosts Per DSL Line
We also want to count how many hosts are connected to each DSL line behind a NAT
gateway to enable us to estimate the ambiguity when using IP addresses as host iden-
tiﬁers. A ﬁrst step towards identifying a lower bound for the number of hosts per line
is to count the number of distinct TTLs observed per line. Recall that Windows uses a
ttlinit of 128 and that MacOS X and Linux use 64 and that most of the observed TTL
values are within the ranges of 61–63, and 125–127. These ranges are far enough apart
to clearly distinguish between them at our monitoring point. Therefore, we can use ob-
served TTLs to distinguish between Windows and non-Windows OSes, yet we cannot
distinguish between distinct Windows systems. This is unfortunate, as analyzing HTTP
user-agents shows that Windows is the dominant OS in our user population.
However, we can use additional information to distinguish hosts. HTTP user-agent
strings of regular browsers (as opposed to user-agent strings used e. g., by software
update tools or media players) include information about the OS, browser versions, etc.
This can help us differentiate between hosts within the same OS family. We ﬁnd that
up to 90 % of all active DSL lines have user-agent strings that contain such OS and
browser version information. In addition, we often observe several different OS and
browser combinations on a single line. We theorize, that home-users tend to keep pre-
installed (OS and browser) software, rather than installing the same software on each
of their machines.
For example, consider the summary of all network activity of one DSL line in
Table 2. We see a directly connected device (TTL 63 == ttlinit − 1) that is only using
DNS. According to our deﬁnition in Section 3.1 this device is classiﬁed as a dedicated
NAT gateway. We also observe TTLs of 126, which is consistent with a Windows OS
behind a NAT gateway. Examining the HTTP user-agent strings we see that both Win2k
and WinXP are present. Thus, we can assume that there are at least two distinct hosts
behind the NAT gateway. However, we also see that the WinXP OS uses several dif-
ferent browser families and versions. While it can happen that users use two different
browser families on a single host (e. g., MSIE and Firefox), it seems rather unlikely
36
G. Maier, F. Schneider, and A. Feldmann
that they use different versions of the same browser family on the same host. Using
this rationale, the two different Firefox versions on WinXP indicate two distinct hosts,
yielding a total of 3 end-hosts.
Or consider the example in Table 3. Here we also see a directly connected device
(TTL 63), however there is also HTTP activity with the same TTL. We therefore clas-
sify this device as a host. We also see TTLs that are consistent with NATed Windows
and Linux systems, so we conclude that the directly connected device serves a dual
function: as NAT gateway and as regular computer. Moreover, we see one OS/browser
combination with TTL 62—another host. For TTL 126 we see only WinVista as OS but
two different browser families, which likely indicates just one host with both Firefox
and MSIE installed. Overall, we infer for this example that there are 3 active hosts.
3.3 A NAT Analysis Tool
We develop a small C program, ttlstats1, to implement our NAT analysis. For each
DSL line, the tool records whether a particular protocol was used by that line, which
TTL was used in packets of this protocol, and for HTTP which user-agents were used.
To identify protocols we use their well-known ports, which works well for the protocols
we consider [5].
For HTTP we parse the user-agent strings and extract the operating system (OS)
version and the browser version. We limit our analysis to user-agent strings from typ-
ical browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera), user-agents from mobile
hand-held devices (see [6]), and gaming consoles (Wii, Xbox, PlayStation). We do not
consider other user-agents (e. g., from software update clients) since those often do not
include OS information or host identiﬁers. To estimate a lower bound for the number of
hosts behind a NAT gateway we use two approaches:
OS only: We only count different (cid:4)TTL,OS(cid:5) combinations as distinct hosts.
OS + browser version: For each (cid:4)TTL,OS(cid:5) combination we also count the number of
different browser versions from the same browser family as distinct hosts. Fire-
fox and Internet Explorer are examples of browser families. We do not consider
different browser families as additional hosts.
In our ﬁrst example above, OS only yields a host count of 2 while OS + browser version
yields a host count of 3. In our second example both counting methods yield a host
count of 3: one Linux system that is used as gateway and regular computer, one NATed
Linux system, and one computer with Windows Vista.
3.4 NAT Analysis for Different Data Set Types
Often the kind of data (anonymized packet-level information with HTTP) we use for
this NAT analysis is not available. However (anonymized) HTTP logs might be more
readily available. Yet, IP/TCP header only traces are common in the measurement com-
munity as well. Thus, we compare how well NAT analysis schemes perform when less
information is available. For this we use several reduced information data sets, and
repeat the analysis.

In this section we present the results from our NAT analysis. We ﬁrst discuss the preva-
lence of NAT devices at DSL lines before continuing with the number of hosts per line.
Finally, we investigate NAT detection with different data set types.
4.1 NAT Usage
Overall, we ﬁnd that NAT is prevalent and that the vast majority of DSL lines use NAT
to connect hosts to the Internet. We also ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant number of lines connects
more than one host. Table 4 summarizes our key ﬁndings. Note that we term a device
or host active if it sent IP packets during the trace. More than 90 % of lines utilize NAT
(Table 4, row A.1). This result differs from the ﬁndings of Armitage [1] from 2002
who only found 25 % of the IPs were behind a NAT. On 9–18 % of lines (B.1) we only
observe trafﬁc that we attribute to the NAT gateway and no trafﬁc from regular hosts2.
We note that this trafﬁc could also be caused by a directly connected, unused host.
However, unused hosts might still check for software or anti-virus updates using HTTP,
and would thus be counted as a host. The remaining lines (82–91 %, B.2) have active
hosts (those lines may or may not be NATed).
We next take a closer look at DSL lines with active hosts and determine how many of
these lines are using NAT. We ﬁnd that only 7–10 % (C.1 and C.2) of lines with active
hosts are not NATed, i. e., there is only one host which is directly connected.
Finally, we investigate how many more hosts than lines are present: the ratio of
detected hosts to the number of lines. In rows D.1 and D.2 we show the number of
observed hosts relative to the number of lines with active hosts. For D.1 we use the
heuristic which counts every unique TTL and OS combination as a separate host (OS
only). For row D.2 we also increment the per line host count if we observe TTL-OS com-
binations with multiple versions of the same browser family (OS + browser version).
