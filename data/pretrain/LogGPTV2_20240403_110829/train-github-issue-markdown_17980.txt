To enhance the functionality of the HTML parser, we propose adding a keyword argument that accepts an integer or a list of integers. These integers would represent the row numbers to be interpreted as header rows. If multiple rows are specified, they will be treated as hierarchical columns, forming a MultiIndex.

This enhancement would also enable the round-tripping of DataFrames with hierarchical columns, ensuring that the structure is preserved during the parsing and exporting process. To our knowledge, this feature does not currently exist in the parser.

This improvement will significantly enhance the flexibility and usability of the HTML parser for complex data structures.
