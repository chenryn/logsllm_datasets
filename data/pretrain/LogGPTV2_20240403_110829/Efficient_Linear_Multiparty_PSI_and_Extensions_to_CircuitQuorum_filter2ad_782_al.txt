DoubleRandomF𝑛,𝑡 (ℓ) which generates (𝑛, 𝑡)-shares and additive
shares of uniform field elements 𝑟1, · · · , 𝑟ℓ. We give an instantiation
of this functionality in Appendix C.1. Now, we describe the protocol
which instantiates the ConvertShares𝑛,𝑡 functionality in Figure 9.
Parameters: 𝑃1, · · · , 𝑃𝑛 are 𝑛 parties. All additions and mul-
tiplications are considered in F. Let 𝑡  𝑛 − 𝑡) pairs of double random sharings, the below
protocol can be executed ⌈ℓ/(𝑛 − 𝑡)⌉ times.
Session 4C: Private Set Intersection CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1198Parameters: 𝑃1, · · · , 𝑃𝑛 are 𝑛 parties. 𝑡 is the corruption
threshold. ℓ ≤ 𝑛 − 𝑡. All additions and multiplications are
considered in F. Let 𝛼1, · · · , 𝛼𝑛 be distinct non-zero elements
in F. Let 𝑀 be a ℓ × 𝑛 matrix, where for 𝑖 ∈ [ℓ] and 𝑗 ∈ [𝑛],
the 𝑖 𝑗𝑡ℎ element of the matrix 𝑚𝑖 𝑗 = (𝛼 𝑗)𝑖−1.
Protocol:
(1) For each 𝑖 ∈ [𝑛],
• 𝑃𝑖 chooses an 𝑠(𝑖) ∈ F uniformly.
• 𝑃𝑖 computes an (𝑛, 𝑡)-sharing [𝑠(𝑖)] and an additive
sharing ⟨𝑠(𝑖)⟩ and sends ([𝑠(𝑖)] 𝑗 , ⟨𝑠(𝑖)⟩𝑗) to 𝑃 𝑗 for each
𝑗 ∈ [𝑛]\{𝑖}.
• 𝑃𝑖 locally computes
([𝑟1]𝑖, · · · , [𝑟ℓ]𝑖) = 𝑀([𝑠(1)]𝑖, · · · , [𝑠(𝑛)]𝑖)𝑇
(⟨𝑟1⟩𝑖, · · · , ⟨𝑟ℓ⟩𝑖) = 𝑀(⟨𝑠(1)⟩𝑖, · · · , ⟨𝑠(𝑛)⟩𝑖)𝑇
(2) Output ([𝑟1], · · · , [𝑟ℓ]) and (⟨𝑟1⟩, · · · , ⟨𝑟ℓ⟩).
Figure 10: DoubleRandomF𝑛,𝑡 (ℓ) Protocol
The security proof of the protocol is verbatim similar to the proof
of DOUBLE-RANDOM(ℓ) from [21]. We refer the reader to [21] for
security proof ideas of the same. For generating shares of ℓ random
𝑛−𝑡 ⌉𝑛(𝑛 −
values, the communication cost of this protocol is 2⌈ ℓ
1)⌈log |F|⌉ and the round complexity is 1. In this paper we invoke
DoubleRandomF𝑛,𝑡 for the setting 𝑡  2𝜎 is a prime. Additions and multiplications in the protocol are over F𝑝. Let 𝑡 < 𝑛/2 be
the corruption threshold.
Input: Party 𝑃1 has stash 𝑆 = {𝑦1, · · · , 𝑦𝑚𝑠 }, where 𝑦 𝑗 ∈ {0, 1}𝜎 and for all 𝑖 ∈ {2, · · · , 𝑛}, 𝑃𝑖 has input set 𝑋𝑖 = {𝑥𝑖1, · · · , 𝑥𝑖𝑚}, where
𝑥𝑖 𝑗 ∈ {0, 1}𝜎. Let 𝑡 < 𝑛/2 be the corruption threshold.
