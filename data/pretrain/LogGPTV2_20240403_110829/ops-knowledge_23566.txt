User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to reset password for Chef web server without email I'm running a Chef server in the cloud. I can't log into the "Chef Manage" web interface because I forgot my password.

I can still use knife to (for example) update nodes from my workstation using the server.

I can still ssh to the server using my private key. I tried running sudo private-chef-ctl password myusername and "successfully" changed my password; however, when I try to sign in using the new password, the web interface still says "Maximum login failures reached, please reset your password."

When I submit the password reset form in the web interface, it says "Your password reset email has been sent", but my server isn't configured to send emails.

How can I reset my password so that I can log into the Chef server using the web interface?

Assistant: Run the following command:

$ chef-server-ctl password "USERNAME"
NewPassword
ReEnter


Important: To reset Web UI, run: chef-manage-ctl restart
