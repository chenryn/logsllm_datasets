User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Failover clustering: tempdb on SAN? We are considering clustering our SQL Server 2008 EE instances. The storage is on SAN. Can we put tempdb data/log files on SAN? What are the pros and cons on this solution? For optimal performance, can we create the same amount of tempdb data files as processor cores?

Assistant: Your only option is to put TempDB on a shared disk resource, meaning the SAN. Standard disk I/O contention is what you're concerned about, moreso for TempDB since it's a central bottleneck for the entire instance. 

As for how many files for TempDB, see Paul Randal's post on this subject. He's responsible for the storage engine, so he is THE expert on the subject: http://www.sqlskills.com/BLOGS/PAUL/post/A-SQL-Server-DBA-myth-a-day-(1230)-tempdb-should-always-have-one-data-file-per-processor-core.aspx
