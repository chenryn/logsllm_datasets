#### Background – Electronic Safe Locks
- **Opening a Lock:**
  - The user enters a code on the keypad.
  - The microcontroller (MCU) verifies the entered code.
  - If the code is correct, the MCU activates the motor to release the bolt.

- **Design and Security:**
  - All logic components are housed inside the safe.
  - Only the keypad and battery are external.
  - The connection between the keypad and the internal lock is made through wires passing through a small hole in the door.
  - A hardened steel plate protects the lock.
  - Direct access to the lock's printed circuit board (PCB) is not possible.

#### Background – Side Channel Attack
- **Side Channel Attack:**
  - This type of attack involves gaining information about the device's state through unintentional information leakage.
  
- **Attacks Discussed:**
  - Power analysis
  - Timing attack

- **Related Concept:**
  - Forcing a system into a specific state using unexpected inputs, such as removing power.

#### S&G 6120
- **Sargent & Greenleaf 6120-332 Safe Lock:**
  - UL listed Type 1 high-security electronic lock.
  - Still in production as of late 2015.
  - Designed and certified around 1994.
  - Uses an ST62T25C microcontroller (ST).
  - Equipped with a 93LC46B serial EEPROM (Microchip).
  - Powered by a 9V alkaline battery located in the external keypad.
  - S&G is a well-respected lock manufacturer.

- **Keycode Storage:**
  - Suppose the actual code is 908437.
  - The keycode is stored in the EEPROM as follows:
    - EEPROM Address: 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03
    - Keycode Digits: 9, 0, 8, 4, 3, 7
    - Stored Word Value: 0x0090, 0x0084, 0x0037

- **Keypad Interior:**
  - There are four wires from the keypad to the lock inside the safe:
    - Battery: 9V nominal
    - Ground: Complete circuits
    - Keypress: 5V when idle, less depending on the key pressed
    - Buzzer: High impedance (Hi-Z) when idle, pulled to ground for buzzer/LED

- **Power Analysis:**
  - Yellow: Data line between MCU and EEPROM
  - Blue: Current into the lock (2A per mV)
  - Annotated trace: The keycode used in this example is “123456”.

- **Demo Circuit:**
  - Components include:
    - Oscilloscope
    - 9V battery
    - Resistors (precision not critical)
    - Basic op-amp (e.g., 10 MHz GBW LM6132)
    - Breadboard/wires/etc.

- **Notes:**
  - The least significant bit (LSB) of each word (even keycode digit) is shifted lower in amplitude by about 20A, regardless of its value.
  - Reading the first three words is sufficient to determine the master keycode.
  - Remaining words store additional keycodes.
  - The failure count is written after all codes are read out.

- **Lessons:**
  - Do not store data in plain text.
  - Store critical data on-chip if possible to reduce the risk of probing.
  - Use a fast serial bus to make simple power analysis more difficult.

#### Titan – Hardware
- **Features:**
  - Motor-driven acme screw to unblock the bolt.
  - STM8S105K6 MCU running at 2 MHz.
  - Keypad identical to that of the S&G 6120.
  - Resistor ladder with a 20.0 kΩ source leg.
  - Designed around 2010 and currently in production.
  - UL listed Type 1 high-security electronic lock.

- **Keypad Emulation:**
  - Simulate key presses by sending the voltage that the divider would produce for a given key.
  - Example: “3” corresponds to 7.68 kΩ, which is 1.40 V.
  - The lock tolerates a voltage error of ±0.10 V.
  - Debounce time is approximately 30 ms.
  - Key interval is about 120 ms.

- **Timing Attack:**
  - Power analysis for timing markers:
    - Current consumption jumps about 29.6 ms before the keycode comparison completes.
    - Use this rise as a reference point for timing.
    - Keycode comparison takes about 200-300 μs, depending on the number of digits before a mismatch.
    - At the end of the comparison, current rises another 275 μA.
    - Determine success or failure based on the delay of this rise relative to the reference point.
    - Each additional correct digit adds about 28 μs of delay.

- **Noise and Oversampling:**
  - Noise sources include jitter in ADC sampling times, lock clock, and current consumption.
  - Use oversampling to improve reliability (10x oversampling recommended).
  - Detect errors by checking if average times are not the expected amount longer (28 μs).

- **Lockout Defeat:**
  - Goal: Reduce Vdd below the STM8 brownout voltage (2.7V) before the EEPROM write completes.
  - If the STM8 is running and the battery voltage (Vbatt) is 9.0V, it takes about 2.7 ms to drop Vdd below the brownout voltage.
  - Can be reduced to 1.0 ms if Vbatt starts at 4.3V and a key is held down to increase current drain.
  - To defeat the firmware battery check, reduce the voltage only after the STM8 has been woken up.

- **Automated Code Recovery:**
  - First five digits via timing attack.
  - Sixth digit through brute force (10 attempts).
  - Check the buzzer line for error beep sequences:
    - Two long beeps: Wrong code
    - One short beep: Correct code
  - Every fourth attempt, try a known-wrong keycode and kill power during the invalid-attempt count to reset the EEPROM to 0x00.

- **Lessons:**
  - Use constant-time comparisons to defend against timing attacks.
  - Assume failure first: Increment the "failed attempt" counter before key comparison begins.
  - Run the MCU clock faster to reduce the margin for timing attacks.

#### Better Locks
- **FF-L-2740B Federal Specification:**
  - GSA-approved locks for securing material classified up to Top Secret.
  - Mandates better design:
    - Internal power source (no power analysis).
    - Resistance to various attacks for at least 20 man-hours.
    - Approval revoked if design is found vulnerable.
