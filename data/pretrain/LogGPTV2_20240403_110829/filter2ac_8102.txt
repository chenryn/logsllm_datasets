### Title: BlackHat US-22: Industroyer2 - Sandworm's Cyberwarfare Targets Ukraine's Power Grid Again

**Abstract:**

Industroyer2, a new variant of the only known malware to have caused electricity blackouts, was recently deployed in Ukraine during the ongoing Russian invasion. Similar to the 2016 attack with the original Industroyer, the objective of this recent cyberattack was to trigger a major blackout, this time targeting over two million people. The attackers also incorporated additional components to amplify the impact and complicate recovery efforts.

We believe that the authors and orchestrators of this malware are the notorious Sandworm Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, which has been attributed by the U.S. Department of Justice to Russia's GRU (Main Intelligence Directorate).

In our presentation, we will delve into the technical details of Industroyer2, including our reverse engineering efforts and a comparative analysis with the original Industroyer. A unique feature of Industroyer is its ability to communicate with electrical substation Industrial Control Systems (ICS) hardware, such as circuit breakers and protective relays, using dedicated industrial protocols. While the original Industroyer supported four protocols, Industroyer2 is designed to use just one: IEC-104.

We will also provide a high-level analysis of the attackers' modus operandi and discuss why and how the attack was largely unsuccessful. One of the most intriguing aspects of Industroyer has been the stark contrast between its sophistication and its limited impact: a blackout lasting only one hour in the middle of the night is far from the worst it could have achieved. Industroyer2 did not even manage to cause a significant outage.

Despite the lack of a major blackout, the attack did cause disruption, primarily through the deployment of multiple pieces of destructive wiper malware, including CaddyWiper. We will discuss this and other malware that accompanied Industroyer2, as well as other cyberattacks we have discovered in Ukraine since the 2022 Russian invasion and the preceding eight years of conflict in Donbas.

Finally, we will present actionable advice for defenders, including:
- Log entries to check
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) rules to consider
- Configuration options to hinder Sandworm compromise and lateral movement
- Detection and hunting rules for Snort and YARA

By sharing our extensive experience in tracking Sandworm, attendees will leave better equipped to protect their infrastructure and detect traces of Sandworm activity.
