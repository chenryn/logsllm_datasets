User: Please explain how to check the disk usage and perform cleanup operations in the Linux system.
Assistant: 1. Use the df command to check the disk usage. The df command can list the usage of disks in the entire system, including information such as used space and free space. Use the df command to see which directories or files are taking up a lot of disk space. 2. Use the du command to check the disk usage of a directory or file. The du command can view the amount of disk space occupied by a specified directory or file. You can use the du command to find out the amount of disk space occupied by a certain directory or file, and clean up the found large file or directory. 3. Delete unnecessary files. Delete unnecessary log files, temporary files, backup files, etc. to free up disk space. You can use the rm command to delete unnecessary files, but before performing the deletion operation, you need to confirm the importance of the files and back up the files that need to be kept. 4. Limit the log file size. For the log files of some applications, you can set the maximum size of the log file in the configuration file. Once the upper limit is reached, it will be automatically divided and saved to avoid a huge log file occupying a large amount of disk space. 5. Clear system cache. In the Linux system, the system will automatically create some cache files and temporary files for caching and temporarily storing some data. You can use the command sudo apt-get clean to clean up the system cache and free up disk space. 6. Move large files to other disks. If multiple disks are available, some large files can be moved to other disks to free up space on the current disk. You can use the mv command to move files into a specified directory. It should be noted that you need to be very cautious when performing disk cleanup operations. Deleting some important files or directories may cause the system to crash or fail to operate normally. Therefore, before performing a disk cleanup operation, be sure to confirm the importance of the file and make a backup.
