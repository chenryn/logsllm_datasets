### Hypothesis and Methodology

We hypothesize that there may be a delay between when spammers register new domains and when they initiate spam campaigns. To investigate this, we examined the time gap between the initial domain registration and the first observed use of these domains in spam attacks. If such a delay exists, it could provide an opportunity for blacklist operators to identify and list malicious domains before the spam campaign begins.

### Time Delay Analysis

**Question:** How much time elapses between domain registration and the first spam attack?

**Figure 1** illustrates the distribution of the time delay between the registration of malicious domains in March 2011 and their first appearance in spam messages. We used timestamps from our spam traps and emails received by Yahoo! mail servers, which provided a global coverage of email traffic. The earliest timestamp of a "bad" domain's appearance in email messages (either from Yahoo! data or spam traps) was taken as the estimated start of the spamming attack. The x-axis represents the delay in days, and the y-axis shows the percentage of malicious domains registered in March 2011.

**Finding 4.1 (Delay until Attack):** More than 55% of the malicious domains appeared in spam campaigns more than one day after they were registered.

We define the first five days after domain registration as the pre-attack period. Approximately 20% of the domains did not appear in any attacks during this period, and the remaining domains had limited time windows for spamming activities. In the rest of the paper, we will analyze the characteristics of the DNS infrastructure for malicious domains throughout their lifetime and within the pre-attack period. Section 5 will further explore the lookup behavior during the early stages.

### DNS Infrastructure Distribution

**Question:** How is the DNS infrastructure that hosts a domain initially distributed across IP address space?

**Figure 2** shows the distribution of IPs associated with NS, MX, and A records for both malicious and legitimate domains across IP address space. The x-axis represents the IPv4 space, and if an IP maps to multiple records from different domains, it is counted only once. The y-axis indicates the cumulative percentage of addresses up to the IP value on the x-axis. The solid blue curves represent legitimate sample domains, the red dashed curves show malicious domains, and the green dash-dot curves represent observed records for malicious domains during the pre-attack period.

**Finding 4.2 (Distribution across IP Address Space):** The IP addresses used by malicious domains in NS, MX, and A records are densely concentrated in a small fraction of the IP address space.

The IP addresses associated with DNS resource records are not evenly distributed across the IP address space. Some network ranges have a higher concentration of IPs, while others are sparsely populated. Specifically, two network blocks, 96.45.0.0/16 and 216.162.0.0/16, contained a significant number of records from malicious domains. The prefix 173.213.0.0/16 also had many IPs in spamming domains, although it also hosted legitimate domains. This observation suggests that if IPs corresponding to different domains' records are close to each other in a network block, those domains may be more likely to be used in future spam campaigns.

### AS Distribution Analysis

**Table 2** shows the top three ASes (Autonomous Systems) ranked by the percentage of domains having records resolved into them. 

**Finding 4.3 (Distribution across ASes):** More than 30% of the malicious domains have at least one record resolving to one or two particular ASes, which are different from those primarily used by legitimate domains.

Legitimate domains often use larger registrars like GoDaddy for DNS management and well-known providers like Google for hosting. In contrast, spamming domains' records are scattered across multiple ASes and countries. Spammers seem to prefer specific ASes for their DNS infrastructure.

**Question:** Are there "bad" ASes that host DNS infrastructure exclusively for malicious domains?

We define an AS as "tainted" if the number of malicious domains whose DNS records resolve within the AS exceeds a certain threshold. After a domain's registration, attackers create DNS entries, and the resulting IPs are checked against the tainted ASes. If a domain has many records resolving to tainted ASes, it is suspected to be related to the observed attacks.

**Finding 4.4 (Domains Hosted by "Bad" ASes):** Most legitimate domains have A, MX, and NS records hosted by reputable ASes, while malicious domains are more likely to be hosted by "tainted" ASes.

### Conclusion

Our analysis reveals that there is a significant delay between the registration of malicious domains and their first use in spam campaigns, providing a window for proactive blacklisting. Additionally, the DNS infrastructure for malicious domains is concentrated in specific IP ranges and ASes, which can help in identifying and mitigating future spam threats.
