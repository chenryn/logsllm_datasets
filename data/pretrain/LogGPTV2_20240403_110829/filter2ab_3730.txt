**Title: Don't @ Me: Hunting Twitter Bots at Scale**

**Abstract:**
Automated Twitter accounts, commonly known as bots, have garnered significant attention for their ability to spread spam, malware, and influence online discussions and sentiment. In this presentation, we will delve into the economy surrounding Twitter bots and provide a comprehensive methodology for identifying and tracking these bots at scale. Our approach consists of three key steps: building a large dataset, identifying common attributes of bot accounts, and developing a classifier to accurately detect bots.

**1. Building the Dataset:**
We begin by demonstrating how to collect a substantial dataset of public Twitter accounts using the Twitter API. This process involves gathering basic profile information and public activity from each account. Additionally, we will map the "social graph" of each account, which includes the accounts they follow and the accounts that follow them. This step is crucial for understanding the network dynamics and patterns associated with bot behavior.

**2. Identifying Common Bot Attributes:**
Once the dataset is assembled, we will explore methods to identify bots within it. We will discuss common techniques employed by real-world bot operators to keep their bots undetected, such as mimicking human behavior and using specific naming conventions. These techniques can often be used to create a fingerprint for bot detection. By analyzing these attributes, we can develop a robust set of indicators to differentiate between genuine and automated accounts.

**3. Building a Classifier:**
Finally, we will demonstrate how to use data science to build a classifier that can accurately identify bots across our large global dataset. This classifier will leverage the insights gained from the previous steps to detect and flag suspicious accounts. The goal is to create a scalable solution that can be applied to any dataset, enabling researchers and security professionals to effectively combat the bot problem.

By following this three-step methodology, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the Twitter bot ecosystem and acquire the tools necessary to track and mitigate the impact of these automated accounts.
