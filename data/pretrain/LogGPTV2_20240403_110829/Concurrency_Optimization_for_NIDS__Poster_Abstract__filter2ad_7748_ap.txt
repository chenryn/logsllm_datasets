### BIOMEDICAL POSTERS

**P-41: Small-molecule mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors diminish metabolic differences between mIDH1 and wIDH1 expressing cells**

**Presenting Author:**
- Ingvild Comfort Hvinden, University of Oxford, Department of Chemistry, United Kingdom

**Co-Authors:**
- John Walsby-Tickle, Christopher J. Schofield, James S. O. McCullagh

**Background:**
- Oncogenic missense mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 are found in at least 13 different cancers.
- These mutations lead to metabolic and epigenetic perturbations, including increased production of the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which is key to tumorigenesis.
- In lower-grade gliomas, approximately 70% of tumors express mIDH1 or mIDH2, but they remain challenging to diagnose early and treat.

**Objective:**
- To understand the effect of small-molecule IDH1 inhibitors (AGI-5198, AGI-120, AGI-881) on altered metabolic pathways in IDH mutant and wild-type cells.

**Methods:**
- Glioblastoma cells (LN18) were genetically engineered to express IDH1 R132H.
- Cell metabolism was investigated using anion exchange and reversed-phase chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.

**Results:**
- Treatment of mIDH cells revealed a substantial decrease in 2HG.
- Elevated levels of 2-oxoglutarate, β-citryl-glutamate, saccharopine, 2-aminoadipate, and oxoadipic acid were observed upon treatment of mutant cells.
- These metabolites are intermediates in lysine metabolism, indicating that this pathway is significantly affected in mIDH1 cells.
- Β-citryl-glutamate, an endogenous iron chelator, is associated with the regulation of neuronal cell differentiation.

**Conclusion:**
- IDH inhibitors can normalize altered mIDH1 metabolism, bringing it closer to wIDH1 metabolism.
- The metabolic adaptations in response to treatment could help identify therapeutic targets, such as the lysine degradation pathway.

**Presenting Author:**
- Hunter Moseley, University of Kentucky, United States

**Co-Authors:**
- Joshua M. Mitchell, Robert M. Flight

**Background:**
- Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of newly diagnosed lung cancers.
- High mortality rates are partly due to the lack of effective treatments for advanced disease.
- Understanding NSCLC metabolism at a molecular level is crucial for developing effective treatments.

**Objective:**
- To systematically examine NSCLC lipid metabolism using ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) and an untargeted assignment tool (SMIRFE).

**Methods:**
- Lipid extracts from paired disease and non-disease tissue samples from 86 patients with suspected resectable stage I or IIa primary NSCLC were prepared and analyzed using FTMS.
- Machine learning was used to classify SMIRFE formula assignments into lipid categories, followed by differential abundance analysis.

**Results:**
- Sterols and glycerolipids were consistently and significantly upregulated in disease versus non-disease tissues.
- The significant sterol upregulation suggests a possible therapeutic role for statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates, inhibitors of endogenous sterol biosynthesis.
- Sterol esters were also consistently and significantly upregulated, suggesting increased stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) activity.
- SCD1 expression is a known negative prognostic indicator for survival in NSCLC.

**Conclusion:**
- Inhibitors of SCD1 and other enzymes involved in the production of this metabolic phenotype could have utility in treating multiple NSCLC genetic subtypes.

**P-53: Reactivation of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase-Driven Pyrimidine Biosynthesis Restores Tumor Growth of Respiration-Deficient Cancer Cells**

**Presenting Author:**
- Sehyun Oh, Seoul National University, South Korea

**Co-Authors:**
- Martina Bajzikova, Jaromira Kovarova, Ana R. Coelho, Stepana Boukalova

**Background:**
- Cancer cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) do not form tumors unless they reconstitute oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by acquiring mitochondria from host stroma.

**Objective:**
- To understand why functional respiration is crucial for tumorigenesis.

**Methods:**
- Time-resolved analysis of tumor formation by mtDNA-depleted cells and genetic manipulations of OXPHOS were used.
- Pyrimidine biosynthesis dependent on respiration-linked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) was investigated.

**Results:**
- DHODH-driven pyrimidine biosynthesis is required to overcome cell-cycle arrest, while mitochondrial ATP generation is dispensable for tumorigenesis.
- Latent DHODH in mtDNA-deficient cells is fully activated with restoration of complex III/IV activity and coenzyme Q redox-cycling after mitochondrial transfer or by introducing an alternative oxidase.
- Deletion of DHODH interferes with tumor formation in cells with fully functional OXPHOS, while disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthase has little effect.

**Conclusion:**
- DHODH-driven pyrimidine biosynthesis is an essential pathway linking respiration to tumorigenesis, pointing to inhibitors of DHODH as potential anti-cancer agents.
