metabolomics data may help to indicate metabolic pathways engaged in tumor growth and activity Plasma samples of 47 NSCLC patients (65±6 
years old, 20 females) were fingerprinted with LC-QTOF-MS Patients also underwent PET/MRI examination Pearson correlation (absolute r>04 
and p≤005 were considered significant) was used to evaluate a relation between intensities of metabolites and MTV, SUV maximum and SUV 
mean values Several bile acids (r=-042-051, p=00006-0002), sulfated steroid hormones (r=-041-055, p=000006-0005), amino acids (r=-

in correlation of metabolites with MTV and SUV values were observed for uric acid (r=-036, p=001 vs r=-044, p=0001), oleamide (r=042, 
p=003 vs r=02, p=02), anandamide (r=-042, p=0003 vs r=-021, p=01), and several lysophosphatidylethanolamines (r=-04-055, p=000006-

Small-molecule mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors diminish metabolic differences between mIDH1 and  
wIDH1 expressing cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ingvild Comfort Hvinden, University of Oxford, Department of Chemistry, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: John Walsby-Tickle, Christopher J. Schofield, James S. O. McCullagh
Oncogenic missense mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 or 2 have been found in at least 13 different cancers These mutations leads to 
metabolic and epigenetic perturbations, including a substantial increase in the oncometabolite R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which is considered key 
to tumorigenesis In lower grade gliomas, approximately 70% of tumours express mIDH1 or mIDH2 but they remain challenging to diagnose early and 
treat; mIDH has emerged as a promising target The goal of this study was to better understand the effect of small-molecule IDH1 inhibitors (AGI-
5198, AGI-120, AGI-881) on altered metabolic pathways in IDH mutant and wild type cells Glioblastoma cells (LN18) were genetically engineered to 
express IDH1 R132H; cell metabolism was investigated using anion exchange and reversed phase chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry 
Treatment of mIDH cells revealed a substantial decrease in 2HG Additionally, 2-oxoglutarate, β-citryl-glutamate, saccharopine, 2-aminoadiapate, 
and oxoadipic acid were elevated upon treatment of mutant cells The latter three metabolites are intermediates in lysine metabolism, a pathway 
which appears to be significantly affected in mIDH1 cells Β-citryl-glutamate is an endogenous iron chelator and has been associated with regulation 
of neuronal cell differentiation These findings suggest that IDH inhibitors are able to ‘normalise’ altered mIDH1 metabolism, bringing it closer 
to wIDH1 metabolism The consequences of such ‘normalisation’ are yet to be understood from a therapeutic perspective, but the metabolic 
adaptations in response to treatment could help identify metabolic targets for therapeutic intervention, eg the lysine degradation pathway

Although the broad range of chemotherapeutic agents approved in the late years, it is a challenge for oncologists to choose which drug or 
combination of drugs will represent the best option for each individual, since only a portion of patients will respond properly In this regard a 
biomarker approach to predict patient response to treatment, may be very helpful in the making decision process Metabolomics, the unbiased 
identification and quantification of small molecule metabolites in biological samples, is particularly promising for biomarker development because 
altered metabolism is considered a hallmark of cancer In this work, we have investigated the metabolome of an initial set of 115 plasma samples 
from lung cancer patients by mean of liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry The obtained data matrix was analyzed according 
the clinical response to each therapy (neoadjuvant and immunotherapy) in order to search for a predictive molecular signature in each group of 
patients As a result, multivariate ROC analysis displayed moderate ability to discriminate between Responder and Non-responder lung cancer 
patients We found and tentatively identified 1 compound that was differentially regulated in lung cancer patients with complete clinical response vs 
progressive disease patients This study has been currently increased with a second batch of 100 samples of lung cancer patients with the objective 
of confirm our previous findings These results suggest that metabolomics might provide a new era of response biomarkers, more appropriate for 
monitoring therapy

Highly untargeted lipidomics of NSCLC shows differentially abundant lipid classes in cancer vs non-cancer tissue
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hunter Moseley, University of Kentucky, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Joshua M. Mitchell, Robert M. Flight
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of newly diagnosed lung 
cancers The high mortality rate is due in part to the lack of effective treatment options for advanced disease Incomplete understanding of NSCLC 
metabolism at a molecular level limits the development of effective treatments Ultra-high-resolution Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FTMS) 
combined with our untargeted assignment tool SMIRFE enable a systematic and less biased examination of NSCLC lipid metabolism From 86 
patients with suspected resectable stage I or IIa primary NSCLC, lipid extracts were prepared from paired disease and non-disease tissue samples 
and analyzed using FTMS Pathological examination revealed that the majority of the samples were primary NSCLC Machine learning was then 
employed to classify SMIRFE formula assignments into lipid categories, followed by differential abundance analysis Both sterols and glycerolipids 
were consistently and significantly upchanged in disease versus non-disease The significant sterol upchange suggests a possible therapeutic role 
for statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates, inhibitors of endogenous sterol biosynthesis, in the treatment of primary NSCLC Additionally, the 
sterol esters are consistently and significantly upchanged, suggesting increased SCD1 activity SCD1 expression is a known negative prognostic 
indicator for survival in NSCLC In our study, a large fraction of the NSCLC samples displayed this phenotype, suggesting that this metabolic 
phenotype is shared across multiple genetic subtypes Thus, inhibitors of SCD1 and other enzymes involved in the production of this metabolic 
phenotype could have utility in the treatment of many NSCLC genetic subtypes

What can we learn about differences in metabolic profiles of urinary tract cancers? Multiplatform approach
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Marta Kordalewska, Dept. of Biopharmacetics and Pharmacodynamics, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland
CO-AUTHORS: Julia Jacyna, Renata Wawrzyniak, Marcin Markuszewski, Marcin Matuszewski, Michał Jan Markuszewski
Standard methods utilized in diagnostics of urinary tract cancers require the use of specialist equipment, may cause patients’ discomfort and are 
adopted when disease symptoms are observed, mostly at the late stage of the disease As Bladder cancer (BCa) and Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) 
constitute ninth and thirteen types of cancer in terms of incidences worldwide, respectively [1}, specific and non-invasive diagnostic methods 
for early diagnosis of BCa and RCC are needed Urine samples obtained from BCa patients and healthy volunteers were analyzed with the use 
of LC-MS and GC-MS The obtained datasets were subjected to deconvolution, filtration and normalization Afterwards, statistical analysis was 
utilized to select metabolites that represented significant differences between studied groups Samples obtained from RCC patients were analyzed 
in analogical manner Finally, the identification of selected metabolites was performed with the use of publicly available databases allowing for 
creation of lists of potential metabolic indicators of BCa and RCC, that were compared for similarities (eg altered concentrations of hippuric acid 
and uridine) The obtained results suggest that urine metabolic fingerprinting could be a powerful tool for metabolic indicators’ investigation and 
searching for explanation of BCa and RCC pathomechanisms at molecular level Acknowledgements: The project was supported by the National

Characterization of Plasma-derived Exosomal Proteins Biomarkers in Glioma Patients
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rashmi Rana, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital,Old Rajinder Nagar, India
CO-AUTHORS: Jyoti Kumari
Exosomes in Glioma are distinctly strong intermediator with ability for flipping the action of neighbouring cells This becomes more obvious that 
exosomes have aptitude to encourage the development of pre metastatic niche As for metastasis to happen, glioma cells need to migrate in a 
new environment which also requires being favourable for tumor to colonize properly Their release into the circulation has the potential to inform 
about tumor status In-depth proteomic characterization of plasma-derived EVs has been limited by challenges in isolating EVs from protein-
abundant biological fluids We implemented a novel single-step density gradient flotation workflow for efficient and rapid isolation of highly 
enriched circulating EXO from plasma-derived exosomes Effective methods for glioma are still in the waiting and there is strong need for high 
confidence identification of blood-based biomarkers Exosomes have recently emerged as a novel source of circulatory biomarkers for cancer 
We assess the value of exosome proteins as biomarkers for glioma NTA and TEM confirmed the presence of plasma-derived EXOs isolated by 
differential centrifugation Total proteins extracted from plasma-derived EXOs of 40 glioma (grade I, II, III, IV) and 40 healthy subjects was analyzed 
FACS analysis to characterized exosomal proteins tetraspanins CD63, CD9 and CD81 was demonstrated to be significantly increased in glioma 
patients with controls1D analysis of exosomal proteins was carried out to identify proteins showing altered levels in glioma cases in comparison to 
controls Our findings support the potential of exosomes derived proteins as a source of biomarkers that complement other approaches for tumor 
assessment

Sequential untrageted metabolomics and lipidomic profiling identifies key difference in amino acid and lipid between the 
bone marrow plasma of MGUS and Multiple Myeloma
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Wilson Gonsalves, Dr., United States
CO-AUTHORS: Kasia Broniowska, Erik Jessen, Xuan-Mai Petterson, Shaji Kumar, Sreekumaran Nair
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell malignancy that is incurable and has a devastating clinical course It is always preceded by an 
asymptomatic precursor disorder, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) We conducted a prospective assessment of 
metabolome differences between the bone marrow plasma obtained from patients with MGUS to that of patients with MM Global metabolite 
profiling was performed by Metabolon Inc on the bone marrow plasma of 25 MGUS patients and 25 MM patients using a Waters ACQUITY ultra-
performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a 
heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35,000 mass resolution Lipidomics was performed on 
a Shimazdu LC and the Sciex SelexIon-5500 QTRAP Following log transformation and imputation of missing values, if any, with the minimum 
observed value for each compound, ANOVA contrasts were used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly between the MGUS and MM 
groups Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were able to show group separation based on several distinct 
classes of metabolites Overall, it was determined that bone marrow plasma samples obtained from patients diagnosed with MM and MGUS, differed 
in a number of metabolic readouts, including changes in lipid metabolism, amino acid catabolism, and nucleotide turnover Verification of these 
results in an independent cohort is required next to lead to a panel of biomarkers that could aid in identifying possible predictive biomarkers of 
progression from MGUS to MM

While tissue metabolomics reveals the direct effect of treatment, serum metabolomics shows a snapshot of the metabolic state of the host 
organism, affected by factors such as diet, age and treatment, in addition to the tumor itself The aim of this study is to characterize the metabolic 
profile in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (N=132) and to relate metabolic changes to treatment response and survival 
Half of the patients were randomized to receive bevacizumab (antiangiogenic drug) in addition to standard chemotherapy, and tumor biopsies and 
serum were collected prior to and during treatment All samples were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) Multilevel 
partial least squares discriminant analysis (multilevel PLS-DA) showed clear changes in serum metabolite levels during treatment (p-values ≤ 001) 
Increased levels of isoleucine and decreased levels of creatine, creatinine, histidine and ornithine, in addition to unfavorable changes in lipid levels 
were observed between pre- and on-treatment samples Bevacizumab treatment and poor response (patients with residual cancer burden (RCB) 
index 3) were associated with the serum metabolic profile (accuracies = 64%, 64%; p-values = 0014, 0049, respectively) Five-year survival could be 
predicted from metabolic profiles in tissue (accuracy = 72%; p-value = 0005), but not serum Low correlations between serum and tissue metabolites 
were observed, revealing the complementary nature of the metabolic information in these biological matrices Collectively, our results demonstrate 
a potential clinical application of serum and tissue metabolomics for patient-monitoring during and after treatment, further indicating potential for 
NMR in assessment of patient outcome

Clear cell (ccRCC) is the most common (75%) lethal subtype of RCC, and is considered a glycolytic and lipogenic tumor More than 30% of patients, 
often incidentally diagnosed by imaging procedures, exhibit locally advanced or metastatic RCC at the time of diagnosis and the disease is inherently 
resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy In this work, serum samples from a cohort that included patients with different ccRCC stages (SI, SII, SIII 
and, SIV; n=112) and controls (n=52) were interrogated with a discovery-based lipidomics approach using ultraperformance liquid chromatography 
coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and machine learning methods Support vector machine models and the least absolute 
shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) variable selection method yielded two discriminant panels for ccRCC detection and early diagnosis A first 
18-feature panel allowed discriminating ccRCC patients from controls with 968% accuracy in a training set under cross-validation, and 814% accuracy 
in an independent test set Fifteen features of the panel were significantly decreased in ccRCC after correcting for multiple testing A second model was 
trained to discriminate early stages (I-II) from late stages (III-IV) ccRCC and provided a 26-feature panel that allowed sample classification with 845% 
accuracy in the training set under cross-validation, and 821% accuracy in the classification of stage I ccRCC patients from an independent test set 
Current work involves feature identification in both panels by accurate mass, isotopic pattern, tandem MS experiments, and chemical standard analysis 
Results are auspicious for early ccRCC diagnosis after validation of the panels in larger and different cohorts

Prostate Cancer (CaP) is the second most common type of cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in men Despite its common occurrence 
and high mortality rate, the currently used CaP biomarkers are still not enough specific and selective Therefore, there is an urgent need for searching 
cancer related metabolites that would support in explaining pathogenesis of the disease and can be considered as potential markers in CaP 
recognition In this project, we performed analyses of metabolic fingerprints from plasma and urine samples derived from prostate cancer patients (n= 
40) and healthy volunteers (n=43) The determinations were utilized using complementary analytical techniques, namely gas chromatography (GC-EI-
QqQ/MS) and liquid chromatography (LC-ESI-TOF/MS) both coupled with mass spectrometry detection Each data set was pre-processed, filtered and 
aligned Next, the univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were carried out for selection of statistically significant metabolites (FDR p value <005) 
and subsequently in order to assess their prediction ability Metabolites were putatively identified using several databases including HMDB, KEGG, 
Metlin and LipidMaps The selected significantly altered metabolites that contribute the most into groups discrimination were mainly linked to amino 
acid, TCA cycle, FFA and purine and pyrimidine metabolism [1] These results have to be further confirmed using targeted metabolomics approach The 
work has been supported by the National Science Centre by the project no 2014/13/D/NZ7/00368

Modified nucleosides are a diverse class of chemically similar compounds where the common nucleosides bare additional functional groups such 
as methylations, acetylations or hydroxylations They are produced under physiological conditions but are especially elevated in transformed 
cells or tissues They cannot be recycled by the cellular salvage pathway and are therefore excreted to cell culture medium or body fluids Here, 
we compare the profiles of excreted modified nucleosides in different pancreatic as well as breast cancer cell lines obtained by LC-QqQ or LC-
IMS-HRMS analysis Cluster analyses are capable of discriminating even different sub-types of these malignancies Thus, monitoring modified 
nucleosides is of high potential in future cancer research

CO-AUTHORS: Marie-Aline Neveu, Ben Zhou, Marcel A. Krueger, Lars Zender, Andreas M. Schmid, Bernd J. Pichler
Senescence is a steady state of cell cycle arrest and an often observed phenomenon in cancer While it can be seen as a stable end-point for the 
disease, still little is known about detailed mechanisms during therapy The investigation of senescence metabolism may therefore help to develop 
new in-vivo markers and treatment approaches In this study we investigated metabolic changes in different senescent cancer cell models using 
in-vitro hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate MRS (7T) and ex-vivo 1H-NMR (600 MHz) Senescence was induced in human colon cancer cells (HCT116) 
by doxorubicin, in liver progenitor cells (HRas) by p53-reactivation and in a liver carcinoma cell line (HCC) by a ribosomal checkpoint inhibitor (RCI) 
Experiments with hyperpolarized 1-13C-pyruvate revealed a significantly decreased lactate production in RCI treated HCC cells without changes 
in alanine production Interestingly, lactate and alanine metabolism were not impaired in senescent HCT116 cells These findings are supported 
by results from 1H NMR data for metabolites of cell growth and energy storage A 2-fold lactate/alanine increase and 3-fold phosphocholine/
glycerophosphocholine decrease was identified for HRas compared to HCT116 cells between control and senescence By contrast, ratios of energy 
storage (phosphocreatine/creatine) were similar between the two cell lines and applied therapy Our first data suggest that senescence metabolism 
is influenced by treatment type as well as genotype RCI inhibition and p53-reactivation impaired lactate production in HCC and HRas progenitor 
cells, respectively, while doxorubicin didn’t in HCT116 cells where cell growth markers remained high Further investigations of lipid metabolism and 
additional sampling time points are required

One carbon metabolomics in cancer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Matthias Schittmayer, OMICs Center Graz, Austria
CO-AUTHORS: Martin Pichler, Joerg Lindenmann, Luka Brcic, Nicola Zamboni, Ruth Birner-Gruenberger
One carbon metabolism is a limiting pathway in cellular proliferation as it is crucial for the biosynthesis of nucleotides Therefore, one carbon 
metabolism has continuously been a major target of cancer chemotherapy from its beginning in the 1950s until the present day Also, altered 
expression levels of individual one carbon metabolism enzymes have been reported as highly significant biomarkers of drug efficacy and disease 
free survival in various types of cancer However, enzyme abundance is only an indirect readout of enzymatic activity and the resulting metabolome 
So far, metabolic analysis of one carbon metabolism has been hampered by the low chemical stability and high interconvertibility of folate cofactors, 
which play a crucial role in the transfer of one carbon units We have developed a complete workflow that employs simultaneous extraction and 
stabilization of folates by derivatization that allows a comprehensive assessment of metabolites in one carbon metabolism and the connected 
pathways We now aim to apply this method on non-small cell lung carcinoma to classify individual tumors based on one carbon metabolism 
patterns and predict chemoresistance/sensitivity as well as tumor differentiation grade and invasiveness, to enable precision treatment

Reactivation of Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase-Driven Pyrimidine Biosynthesis Restores Tumor Growth of Respiration-
Deficient Cancer Cells
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sehyun Oh, Seoul National University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Martina Bajzikova, Jaromira Kovarova, Ana R. Coelho, Stepana Boukalova
Cancer cells without mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) do not form tumors unless they reconstitute oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by mitochondria 
acquired from host stroma To understand why functional respiration is crucial for tumorigenesis, we used time-resolved analysis of tumor 
formation by mtDNA-depleted cells and genetic manipulations of OXPHOS We show that pyrimidine biosynthesis dependent on respiration-
linked dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is required to overcome cell-cycle arrest, while mitochondrial ATP generation is dispensable for 
tumorigenesis Latent DHODH in mtDNA-deficient cells is fully activated with restoration of complex III/IV activity and coenzyme Q redox-cycling 
after mitochondrial transfer, or by introduction of an alternative oxidase Further, deletion of DHODH interferes with tumor formation in cells 
with fully functional OXPHOS, while disruption of mitochondrial ATP synthase has little effect Our results show that DHODH-driven pyrimidine 
biosynthesis is an essential pathway linking respiration to tumorigenesis, pointing to inhibitors of DHODH as potential anti-cancer agents
