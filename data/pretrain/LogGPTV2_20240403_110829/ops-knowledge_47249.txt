User: My OS is CentOS 7.0. It's embedded python version is 2.7, and I want to update it to Python 3.4.
when input the 
print sys.path
output is:

['', '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/setuptools-5.8-py2.7.egg',
  '/usr/lib64/python27.zip', '/usr/lib64/python2.7',
  '/usr/lib64/python2.7/plat-linux2', '/usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-tk',
  '/usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-old', '/usr/lib64/python2.7/lib-dynload',
  '/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages',
  '/usr/lib64/python2.7/site-packages/gtk-2.0',
  '/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages']

So, if I download the python 3.7, then ./configure , make , make install. Will it override all the python-related files ? Or if I use the 

./configure --prefix=***（some path）

then is it safe to remove all the old python files or directory?
In a word, hope someone gives me instructions about how to update to python 3 on linux. Thanks a lot.
Assistant: Python 2 and 3 can safely be installed together. They install most of their files in different locations. So if the prefix is /usr/local, you'll find the library files in /usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/ where X.Y are the major and minor version numbers.
The only point of contention is generally is the file python itself, which is generally a symbolic link.
Currently it seems most operating systems still use Python 2 as the default, which means that python is a symbolic link to python2. This is also recommended in the Python documentation.
It is best to leave it like that for now. Some programs in your distributions may depend on this, and might not work with Python 3.
So install Python 3 (3.5.1 is the latest version at this time) using your favorite package manager or compiling it yourself. And then use it by starting python3 or by putting #!/usr/bin/env python3 as the first line in your Python 3 scripts and making them executable (chmod +x <file>).
