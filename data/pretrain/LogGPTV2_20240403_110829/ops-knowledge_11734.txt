Question: Why might relying solely on the HomeKit protocol's default settings not be the most secure approach to setting up a smart home network?
"A": "Default settings might not restrict accessory access to the internet beyond the manufacturer-provided list of sites and ports, which may not account for all possible vulnerabilities.",
"B": "The use of PPSK for all accessories might not be supported, leaving some devices using a common Wi-Fi password that could be compromised.",
"C": "HomeKit data is only encrypted in backups, leaving local data storage on the devices vulnerable to unauthorized access.",
"D": "Automatic default settings could allow unrestricted local network access until a manufacturer-provided list is available, potentially exposing the network."
