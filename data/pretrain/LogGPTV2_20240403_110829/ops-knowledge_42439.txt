User: In a large-scale web application, how to use the Nginx load balancer to improve the concurrent processing capability of the system?
Assistant: Nginx is currently a very popular web server and reverse proxy server, and can be used as a load balancer. Using Nginx as a load balancer can improve the concurrent processing capability of the system. The specific implementation is as follows: 1. Configure multiple servers: distribute the web application on multiple servers, and install the same web application on each server. 2. Install the Nginx server: Install the Nginx server on an independent server and use it as a load balancer. 3. Configure the Nginx server: The Nginx server needs to be configured with a reverse proxy to distribute external access requests to multiple internal servers. Various strategies can be configured for load balancing, such as round robin, minimum number of connections, etc. 4. Monitoring and optimization: Monitor server and application performance and make adjustments and optimizations as appropriate. Generally speaking, using Nginx as a load balancer can realize the distribution of concurrent requests, improve the performance and reliability of web applications, and ensure that users can use the system normally.
