attribute. AS48285 peers directly with a route collector, and
hosts BGP and DNS security-related databases. AS16150 is
a transit provider for AS48285 and has been bought and is
currently being merged into a larger transit provider AS12552,
which we observe forwarding announcements with the DISCO
attribute, suggesting the DISCO attribute may not be dropped
after the transit merger is complete.
By combining the results from our two experiments in
this way (the “Joined” row in Table IV), we ﬂag the two
ASes in D (discussed above) and a single additional AS as a
candidate for ﬁltering the DISCO preﬁx. We have conﬁrmed
with the operators of the additional network that they do not
employ any ﬁltering of optional-transitive attributes; instead,
the network uses the FRR software router and, due to a
bug in the FRR software, experienced instabilities during our
experiment (§VII-A5).
4) Identifying ﬁltering on the data plane: We use RIPE At-
las to run traceroute measurements to the DISCO and control
preﬁxes and identify ﬁltering ASes. We convert traceroutes to
AS-level routes by mapping IP addresses to AS numbers using
Team Cymru’s IP-to-AS database [59]. We then use the in-
ferred AS-level route to repeat the analysis in §VII-A3. Before
the experiments, we run measurements from all RIPE Atlas
vantage points to each PEERING announcement location, then
greedily choose vantage points to use during the experiment so
as to maximize the total number of ASes traversed on routes to
the PEERING location. We run traceroutes from 1600 locations
over 20 minutes to conform with the rate limit that RIPE Atlas
enforces.
Columns under “Traceroute” in Table IV summarize our
results. We show the number of traceroutes collected,
the
number of ASes covered on traceroute measurements toward
the control preﬁx (|A|), and the number of ASes that may
be ﬁltering (|F|). Since we lack information about BGP
attributes in the traceroute measurements, we cannot mea-
sure which ASes discard DISCO’s attribute when relaying
the advertisement (i.e., we cannot compute |D|); these ASes
maintain connectivity and are therefore counted toward the |A|
column. We observe measurements from approximately 1200
RIPE Atlas probes (in the columns under “number of traces”),
which is what we expect given the measurement period and
experiment duration (1200/1600 = 15/20).
We compute F as before, and then remove from F ASes
which replied to our zmap data-plane measurements, since we
know they had a route to the DISCO preﬁx. ASes with a
default route may ﬁlter the DISCO preﬁx and still respond to
pings [12]. To correctly account for these cases, we infer ASes
that use default routes (Appendix A) and report a range: the
lower end assumes that no AS inferred to use a default route
ﬁlters the preﬁx, and the higher end assumes that all ASes
inferred to use a default route ﬁlter the preﬁx.
We ﬁnd that the number of ASes seen on routes toward
each preﬁx is similar and that F is small, providing further
indication that only a few ASes are likely to be ﬁltering the
announcement to the DISCO preﬁx. The number of ASes in
F grows in comparison to the previous control-plane based
experiment (§VII-A3) since unresponsive routers and incorrect
IP-to-AS mappings may increase the number of candidates
for ﬁltering ASes ﬂagged by our analysis, and the broader
coverage will accumulate more errors.
The “(cid:54)= paths” column shows the number of ASes that
choose different routes to the DISCO and control preﬁxes,
with the condition that the chosen route toward the control pre-
ﬁx does not intersect F. This column counts ASes that choose
different routes to our preﬁxes, but for reasons unrelated
to ﬁltering. For example, ASes can choose different routes
for different preﬁxes due to tie-breakers in BGP’s best path
algorithm, like preferring the oldest among multiple equally-
preferred routes [4]. ASes that choose different routes to our
preﬁxes could cause false positives when inferring candidates
for ﬁltering. We expect that our inferred candidates are unlikely
to be performing ﬁltering (and instead have been labelled as
candidates due to routing decisions of other ASes).
Finally, the “Joined” row shows results when we consider
AS-paths from both the UFMG and UW experiments when
computing F. The decrease in |F| indicates that most ASes
ﬂagged as candidates for ﬁltering in one experiment appear in
a route to the DISCO preﬁx on the other experiment.
5) Router support for DISCO and the FRR incident: The
results of our experiments, summarized in Table IV, show that
the DISCO preﬁx had disseminated across the network to
a similar extent as the control preﬁx, indicating that today’s
border gateway routers can support the DISCO protocol.
One notable exception is the case of FRR software routers.
These routers had used the 0xFF attribute (reserved by the BGP
standard for experiments) to communicate internal state among
several FRR routers in the same AS. Our experiment used the
0xFF attribute to carry the DISCO preﬁx, which is protocol
compliant but did not conform with the encoding an FRR
router expects. As a result, FRR routers reset their sessions
upon receipt of the attribute. FRR is the only reported router
distribution affected by our experiments.
Upon receiving notiﬁcation of the issue after our UFMG

announcement, we immediately put our experiments on hold,
added FRR to our controlled testing environment, and coordi-
nated with FRR developers and network operators. The FRR
developers issued a patch within two days of this incident
(CVE-2019-5892 [46]), and we conﬁrmed that it ﬁxes the bug
triggered by our experiment. We postponed the experiments
to allow for a two-week upgrade window after the release of
the FRR updates. We received new reports of disruption after
resuming the experiment from UW and decided to cancel more
experiments from other PEERING locations. As time passes, we
believe that this patch will disseminate to the vast majority of
FRR deployments.
Figure 5 shows the number of BGP updates received by
RIPE RIS and RouteViews route collectors during the execu-
tion of our experiments. The UFMG experiment ran on Jan. 7,
2019, between 14:30 and 14:45 GMT and the UW experiment
ran on Jan. 23, 2019 between 14:00 and 14:15 GMT. We
also show lines for Jan. 6, 2019, as a baseline. We note that
the spike in the number of updates around 13:30 on Jan. 7
is unrelated to our experiment but of a similar magnitude.
We can see an increase in the number of updates during our
experiments, which we attribute to FRR routers. However, we
also see that our second experiment had a much smaller effect,
indicating that the patch was getting adopted. We believe that
this incident does not mean that DISCO is incompatible with
today’s Internet but rather reﬂects a bootstrapping cost that will
diminish as operators using the FRR routing daemon upgrade
and adopt the existing patch.
After the incident, most operators who sent messages to
the NANOG mailing list expressed support for continuing
the experiment, arguing that the announcements comply with
BGP standards and that operating routers with known remotely
exploitable bugs is a severe vulnerability. A small number of
operators expressed concerns that research should be careful
not to impact Internet operations, which we agreed with and
tried to implement by coordinating with operators, executing

tests in controlled environments, and changing the experiment
schedule upon receiving the report of the problem. We discuss
safe re-execution of our experiments and, more generally,
similar experiments extending BGP in Appendix B.
6) Summary: Despite experimental challenges (BGP ses-
sion resets, VM overload, and FRR failure) and a limited
number of experiments,
the results indicate no signiﬁcant
difference between the propagation of a plain announcement
and an announcement carrying a custom BGP attribute. Our
announcements with the DISCO BGP attribute propagated
widely, and possibly globally, evidence that DISCO may be
readily deployable. The main conjecture we make is that a
standardized BGP attribute would allow prompt deployment
of DISCO. However, our results are based on limited mea-
surements, and it is desirable to further conﬁrm them using
additional experiments and analyses, in particular additional
measurements exploring the topology from more additional
announcement locations.
B. DISCO Security Evaluation
Our security evaluation focuses on DISCO’s certiﬁcation
mechanism. For DISCO to provide a reliable source of in-
formation for ﬁltering malicious announcements, we need to
show that, (i) under normal conditions (no attack) the de facto
owner can obtain a certiﬁcate with high probability, and that
(ii) an attacker’s attempt to obtain a certiﬁcate for a preﬁx it
does not control is likely to fail. For case (ii), we consider
initial certiﬁcation as a worst-case scenario as preﬁxes with a
certiﬁcate and active ROAs are harder to attack.
To perform our evaluation we build on an existing BGP
simulator [15] that uses the BGP route-computation framework
by Gill et al. [25]. We extend the simulator to mark ASes
as DISCO’s vantage points and provide statistics to the
routes they observe. Our simulator uses the 262 AS vantage
points afforded by RouteViews and RIPE RIS which feed our
implementation (§VI). We run simulations on the empirically-
derived CAIDA AS-level graph from August 2019 [2].
1) Setting the certiﬁcation threshold: We evaluate how dif-
ferent rates for ASes discarding DISCO’s attribute or ﬁltering

launch attacks against customers.
In case an attacker controls the vantage points that feed
a registrar, crossing the 95% certiﬁcation threshold is still
very challenging. For example, even if the attacker controlled
half of the vantage points that feed every registrar and had
them report announcements with its public key for DISCO’s
attribute, the other half of vantage points would still report
the announcement it received (as reported in Figure 7). The
attacker would only succeed in certifying a block when less
than 10% of the honest vantage points observe the legitimate
route (in other words, when 90% of the honest vantage points
choose the hijacked route), which happens for about 8% of the
cases (Figure 7).
Safety is not very sensitive to the choice of vantage points.
We evaluate the attacker success rate in simulations where
the registrar uses a random subset of only 50 out of the
262 vantage points afforded by RouteViews and RIPE RIS.
For each of 13 combinations of vantage points, we verify the
probability that an attacker hijacks a preﬁx and successfully
obtains a certiﬁcate by running 105 simulations varying the
victim and attacker ASes. We ﬁnd that, on average, the attacker
fails to cross the certiﬁcation threshold 99.3% of the time, and
the standard deviation across the 13 combinations of vantage
points is 0.5%. (We assumed all ASes propagate announce-
ments with DISCO’s attribute during these simulations.)
Subpreﬁx hijack. The attacker may also launch a subpreﬁx
hijack. In this case, the attacker is the only one announcing
the subpreﬁx. Therefore, the attacker will hijack the routes
from all vantage points to the subpreﬁx. However, running
such an attack will also disconnect
the victim’s subpreﬁx
from the Internet: the only route for the subpreﬁx is to the
attacker; hence even the attacker does not have a route to the
victim AS and cannot relay to the victim intercepted trafﬁc.
Running a subpreﬁx hijack for a long certiﬁcation interval is
highly visible and allows the victim to prevent certiﬁcation by
announcing the same subpreﬁx which would create a scenario
similar to the preﬁx hijack discussed above. As a result,
DISCO signiﬁcantly raises the bar for a successful attack.
In §VIII we extend DISCO to limit an attacker’s ability to
certify, even if they launch a subpreﬁx hijack.
Temporary hijacks. An attacker may aim to simply prevent
DISCO (re-)certiﬁcation by the legitimate owner (instead of
obtaining an illegitimate certiﬁcate) by launching a temporary
hijack during the certiﬁcation period. This is a less damaging
attack, but would prevent issuance of ROAs and undermine
the beneﬁts of DISCO. However, such an attack still requires
a concurrent widely-visible hijack of the preﬁx that lasts long
enough to reduce the owner’s control of the preﬁx below the
threshold (Table II, §V-A3). Such an attack does not limit
deployability of DISCO and is impossible against certiﬁed
preﬁxes when ROV is widely adopted.
5In particular, a provider can drop a client’s DISCO attribute from BGP
updates, preventing certiﬁcation of that client’s preﬁxes.

its announcement affect the certiﬁcation mechanism, assuming
that a registrar feeds from the 262 vantage points mentioned
earlier. In each iteration of the following simulation, we
randomly select a different origin AS for the announcement,
1% − 10% of ASes chosen at random to drop announcements
with the DISCO attribute (shown on X axis), and 1% − 5%
of ASes chosen to discard the attribute (shown as different
lines). Figure 6 shows the percent of vantage points that would
observe DISCO’s attribute (each data point is the average of
105 random iterations). Our Internet measurements in §VII-A
indicate that less than 1% ﬁlter DISCO’s announcement or
discard its attribute. Under these conditions, Figure 6 shows
that a certiﬁcation threshold of 95% allows certifying owner-
ship in all cases (topmost line).
2) Attacks on DISCO: DISCO issues certiﬁcates based on
the public key attached to announcements that vantage points
observe. To launch a successful attack, an attacker needs to
hijack routes to the victim’s preﬁx from many vantage points
(the certiﬁcation threshold) for the certiﬁcation interval. Our
simulations assume that the victim is not already protected by
DISCO (or it would be protected from the attack).
Preﬁx hijack. We ﬁrst consider a preﬁx hijacker who an-
nounces the victim’s preﬁx. To evaluate the attacker’s success
rate, we select 105 random attacker-victim pairs where both
attacker and victim announce the same preﬁx. We select 1%
of ASes at random to ﬁlter DISCO announcements and 2%
of ASes to discard the attribute. Figure 7 shows the fraction of
vantage points whose routes to the victim the attacker succeeds
in hijacking. A certiﬁcation threshold of 95% as suggested
earlier means that in about 3% of cases the preﬁx hijacker
would succeed. The reason that the preﬁx hijacker typically
fails is that the victim also announces the same preﬁx, so trafﬁc
splits between the victim and attacker and typically neither
party achieves the required level of visibility at vantage points
to certify ownership. Only 3% of hijacks successfully reach
95% of vantage points and obtain an illegitimate certiﬁcate.
For 81% of illegitimate certiﬁcates, the successful attacker is
the upstream provider of the victim. However, an upstream
provider is in a position to intercept its customer’s trafﬁc
