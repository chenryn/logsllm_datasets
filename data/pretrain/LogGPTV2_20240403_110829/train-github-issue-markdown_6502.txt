**Steps to reproduce and a minimal demo of the problem**
You can see the issue in the official routing demo:
https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/toh-5/ts/plnkr.html.
_What steps should we try in your demo to see the problem?_
  1. Open the demo in Internet Explorer 11.
  2. Click a route link to navigate to it. This works fine and the new route content displays correctly.
  3. Click the browser's back button to go back to the previous route.
**Current behavior**
In Internet Explorer 11, most of the component content is not rendered when
using the browser back or forward buttons to navigate to it.
**Expected/desired behavior**
Route content should be displayed regardless of whether navigation occurred
via a link or back/forward buttons.
**Other information**
Chrome and Firefox work fine, so this must be caused by a difference in
Internet Explorer.
