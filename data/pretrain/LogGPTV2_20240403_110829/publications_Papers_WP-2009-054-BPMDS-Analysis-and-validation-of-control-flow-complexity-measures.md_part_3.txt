### Analysis of Process Models

In the first set of experiments, participants took more time to make modifications to process models 5, 7, and 10. Conversely, for process models 3, 4, and 7, the requested modifications were carried out more quickly. In the second set of experiments, the time required for tasks related to model understandability was greater for process models 1, 2, 3, 4, and 13. For modifiability tasks, participants spent more time on models 1, 2, and 13.

The results from both sets of experiments highlight a relationship between the time taken to understand a model and its complexity. This is evident when comparing the data in Tables 5 and 6, where process models 7 and 10 in the first set and models 1 to 4 in the second set are identified as the most complex. The descriptive analysis of correct answers, subjective evaluations, and efficiency was conducted similarly. After completing the descriptive analysis, a statistical correlation analysis was performed, which is detailed below.

### 5.2 Correlation Analysis

#### 5.2.1 Normality Test
The first step in the correlation analysis was to determine if the data distribution was normal. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied, and the results indicated that the distribution was not normal. Therefore, a non-parametric statistical test, specifically the Spearman correlation coefficient, was used with a significance level of α = 0.05. This indicates a 95% confidence level and a 5% probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (Type I error).

#### 5.2.2 Results of the First Family
Table 7 presents the correlations between the CFC metrics and the dependent variables. For understandability, the CFC metric was validated in the fourth experiment, correlating with answer times and subjective evaluation. This suggests that the number of AND-split constructs affects the understandability of the model, as reflected in the answer times.

**Table 7: Correlations of the CFC Metrics and Understandability - First Family**

| Measure | Times | Sub. Eval. | Times | Subj. Eval. | Efficiency |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Exp-4   | X     | X          |       |             |            |
| Exp-4   | X     | X          |       |             |            |
| Exp-2   | X     | X          |       |             |            |
| Exp-2   | X     | X          |       |             |            |
| Exp-3   | X     | X          |       |             |            |
| Exp-2   | X     | X          |       |             |            |
| Exp-3   | X     | X          |       |             |            |

For modifiability, the CFC XOR-split and CFC metrics were validated in experiments 2 and 3, relating to answer times, subjective evaluation, and efficiency. Only the CFC AND-split was validated in the third experiment concerning subjective evaluation.

From these results, it is clear that the CFC metrics have a stronger relationship with process complexity, particularly in terms of modifiability. Specifically, the XOR-split construct significantly affects the modifiability of the model. The validation of the CFC metric, which includes all split constructors, indicates that the structural complexity of a process, from a control-flow perspective, influences modifiability.

#### 5.2.3 Results of the Second Family
In the second set of experiments, understandability and modifiability were evaluated in separate experiments designed to analyze each aspect individually. The same procedure as in the first set of experiments was followed, and the summary of data for each dependent variable measure (answer times, correct answers, subjective evaluation, and efficiency) was used to perform the correlation analysis.

**Table 8: Correlations of the CFC Metrics and Understandability - Second Family**

| Measure | Times | C. Answer | Sub. Eval. | Efficiency | Times | C. Answer | Sub. Eval. | Efficiency |
|---------|-------|-----------|------------|------------|-------|-----------|------------|------------|
| E-1     | X     |           | X          | X          | X     |           | X          | X          |
| E-2     | X     | X         | X          | X          | X     | X         | X          | X          |
| E-3     | X     |           | X          | X          | X     |           | X          | X          |
| E-4     | X     |           | X          | X          | X     |           | X          | X          |
| E-5     | X     |           | X          | X          | X     |           | X          | X          |

The CFC metrics were generally validated in relation to the analyzed variables. For understandability, the correlations with answer times, subjective evaluation, and efficiency were validated in all experiments. Correct answers were only validated in the second experiment.

Regarding modifiability, all CFC metrics were highly correlated with the modifiability of the process models. The influence of control-flow complexity on modifiability is primarily reflected in the answer times, subjective evaluation, and efficiency of task completion.

There are significant differences between the results obtained from the correlation analysis in the second set of experiments compared to the first. These differences can be attributed to the improved experimental material used in the second set, which had greater variability in structural complexity based on feedback from the first set. The second set of experiments focused on two main characteristics: 
1. The selection of a subset of structural complexity measures (29 out of 60 initially defined) based on empirical results and principal component analysis.
2. An increase in the variability of the structural complexity of the models.

These improvements make the results from the second set of experiments more conclusive. The results indicate that XOR-split, OR-split, and AND-split constructors affect the understandability and modifiability of the model. Based on these findings, we can reject the null hypotheses and conclude that there is a significant correlation between the CFC metric and the understandability and modifiability of BPMN models.

### 6 Conclusions

This work presents the evaluation and empirical validation of the CFC metric for measuring the complexity of BPMN business processes from a control-flow perspective. The empirical validation was achieved through two sets of experiments, comprising a total of ten experiments. These experiments aimed to evaluate the structural complexity of BPMs to provide useful information about their understandability and modifiability.

The CFC metric is a design-time measurement that can be used to assess the difficulty of producing a BPMN process design before implementation. Incorporating control-flow complexity analysis into the process development cycle can significantly influence the design phase, leading to more optimized processes. It is well-established in software engineering that it is cost-effective to address defects early in the design lifecycle.

By applying the CFC metric, we obtained additional information about the structural complexity of business processes. We validated the CFC metric and demonstrated its high correlation with the control-flow complexity of a business process, thereby affecting its understandability and modifiability. These results, along with the validation of BPMN measures, provide valuable information for improving and maintaining process models. A better understanding of the process facilitates its modeling and evolution.

We believe that evaluating and measuring business process complexity in the early phases of development (such as design and modeling) can help identify problems in a process model, aiding in the design or selection of models that are easy to understand for all stakeholders. Understandable models also facilitate maintenance tasks, reducing implicit costs. Additionally, models that are easy to understand and maintain can support tasks such as process reengineering, large-scale redesign, and refactoring.
