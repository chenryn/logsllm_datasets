analyse process models 5, 7 and 10, whilst they took more time to carry out the
modifications requested with process models 3, 4 and 7. On the other hand, the time
taken by the subjects in the second family of experiments to carry out the tasks
relating to the model’s understandability is greater for process models 1, 2, 3, 4 and
13. For the modifiability tasks, the models 1, 2 and 13 had more spend time.
The results in both families reflect, in the first instance, the relationship of the
understandability times - degree of model complexity, when comparing tables 5 and
6, since process models 7 and 10 in the first family and process models 1 to 4 in the
second family coincide as being those of greater complexity. The descriptive analysis
relating to correct answers, subjective evaluation and efficiency was carried out in a
similar manner. Once the descriptive analysis of the data had been completed, the
statistical correlation analysis was carried out, which is presented next.
5.2 Correlation Analysis
The first step in the correlation analysis was to ascertain whether the distribution of
the data was normal, so the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied. As we obtained
that the distribution was not normal, we decided to use a non-parametrical statistical
test, namely the Spearman correlation coefficient with a level of significance of α =
0.05, which indicates the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is certain
(type I error). That is to say, a confidence level of 95% exists. The Spearman
correlation coefficient was used to separately correlate each of the measures with the
dependant variables as regards each of the aspects evaluated in the descriptive
analysis (answer times, correct answers, subjective evaluation and efficiency). The
following subsections show the results obtained in the two families of experiments.
5.2.1 Results of the First Family
Table 7 shows the results of the correlations of the CFC metrics with regard to the
measures of the dependent variables. With regard to understandability, only the
CFC metric was validated in the fourth experiment in correlation with the
AND-split
answer times and subjective evaluation. In this case, we can assume that the number
of AND-split construct affects the understandability of the model, which is reflected
in the answer time.

CFC (XOR) X X X X X
CFC (OR)
CFC (AND) X X X
CFC X X X X
With regard to modifiability, the correlation analysis shows that the CFC
XOR-split
and CFC metrics were validated in experiments 2 and 3 in relation to the answer
times, subjective evaluation and efficiency. On the other hand, only the CFC
AND-split
was validated in the third experiment in relation to the subjective evaluation.
From the results of the correlations analysis obtained in the first family of
experiments, we can observe that the relationship of CFC metrics to process
complexity is greater with respect to the modifiability aspect in particular.
Specifically, these results show that the XOR-split construct affects above all the
modifiability of the model. In addition, the validation of the CFC metric (which adds
all the split constructors) gives us an indication that the structural complexity of a
process, from the point of view of control flows, affects modifiability.
5.2.2 Results of the Second Family
In the second family of experiments also, the understandability and modifiability
aspects were evaluated but in separate experiments, designed to analyse each aspect.
By following the same procedure as that which was carried out in the first
experimental family, once we had obtained the summary of data for each of the
dependent variables measures (answer times, correct answers, subjective evaluation
and efficiency) we carried out the analysis of correlations.
Table 8 shows that the CFC metrics were, on the whole, validated in relation to the
variables analyzed. With regard to the understandability the correlations with the
answer time the CFC metrics were validated in all experiments. This same correlation
exists with respect to the variables of subjective evaluation and efficiency. With
regard to the correct answers, these were only validated in the second experiment.

CFC (OR) X X X X X X X X X X X X X X
CFC (AND) X X X X X X X X X X X X X

The correlation analysis results with regard to the modifiability also indicate that
all the CFC metrics are highly correlated with the modifiability of the process models.
The influence of the control-flow complexity on the modifiability of the BPMN
models is reflected principally in the answer time in the required tasks, as well as in
the subjective evaluation and efficiency in the accomplishment of the tasks.
There are significant differences between the results obtained from the correlation
analysis in the experiments of the second family as compared to the first one. These
differences were also observed when the validation of measures for BPMN models
was carried out. A reason for this was that the experimental material used in the
second family of experiments was an improved version of the first one (which had not
much variability in the structural complexity), according to the feedback obtained.
This way, the accomplishment of the second family was based on two main
characteristics: a) the selection of a subset of structural complexity measures which
included only the most significant measures (29 from the 60 initially defined)
according to empirical results and an analysis of principal components and b) the
increase in the variability of the structural complexity of the models. All this being so,
we can consider the results obtained in the second family to be more conclusive.
The results obtained indicate that XOR-split, OR-split, and AND-split constructors
affect the understandability and modifiability of the model. Therefore, based on the
results and as regards the hypothesis proposed, it is possible to reject the null
hypotheses and conclude that there is a significant correlation between the CFC
metric and the understandability and modifiability of BPMN models.
Finally, as result of this empirical study, we consider that the CFC metric is a
suitable complement in measuring the structural complexity of business processes
models with BPMN alongside the measures proposed in [3]. With the use and
validation of the CFC metrics it is possible to obtain additional information with
regard to the structural complexity of BPMs, in this case from a control-flow
perspective. This allows designers to determine at the time of building process models
(given more than one possible and equivalent modelling alternative) which of those
models is more usable and maintainable.
6 Conclusions
In this work we have presented the evaluation and empirical validation of the CFC
metric for measuring BPMN business process complexity from the point of view of
their control-flows. The empirical validation was made possible by using the results
obtained from two families of experiments which included the carrying out of a total
of ten experiments. Initially, these experiments were carried out with the aim of
evaluating the structural complexity of BPMs, as a means towards obtaining useful
information concerning their understandability and modifiability.
The CFC is a design-time measurement. It can be used to evaluate the difficulty of
producing a BPMN process design before implementation. When control-flow
complexity analysis becomes part of the process development cycle, it has a
considerable influence on the design phase, leading to further optimized processes. It
is a well-known fact in software engineering that it is cost-effective to fix a defect
earlier in the design lifecycle rather than later. To enable this to be done we introduce
the first steps with which to carry out process complexity analysis.
As a result of applying the CFC metric, we were able to obtain additional
information regarding the structural complexity of business processes. It was also
possible to validate the CFC metric and to prove that it is highly correlated with the
control-flow complexity of a business process and therefore with its understandability
and modifiability. These results, along with the results on the validation of BPMN
measures previously obtained, provide useful information when carrying out
improvements or maintenance tasks in the process model. A better understanding of
the process facilitates its later modelling and evolution.
We believe that evaluation and measurement of business process complexity in
early phases of development (such as design and modeling phases) can help to
identify problems in a process model and therefore assist us to design or choose
process models that are easy to understand for all stakeholders. Understandable
models also facilitate maintenance tasks, reducing implicit costs. On the other hand,
models that are easy to understand and maintain can provide support on development
of tasks, such as process reengineering, redesign of business process on a large-scale
and refactoring, amongst others.
