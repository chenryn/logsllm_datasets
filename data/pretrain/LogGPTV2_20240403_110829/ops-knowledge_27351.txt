**Question:**
Is there a script or solution to enhance security by opening a port only when a specific sequence of ports is detected in the logs? Specifically, for SSH remote connections, I have implemented the following security measures:

1. Open a non-standard port.
2. Use mandatory digital certificates for authentication.
3. Allow connections from a specific IP range only.

However, I am wondering if these measures are sufficient to protect my SSH remote access. I am considering a solution that would:

- Listen to syslog and filter for SSH access attempts.
- If a predefined sequence of ports is detected, open the non-standard SSH port for a few minutes.
- Close the port again if no active session is established.

This would essentially be a "port key" implementation. Does such a solution exist, and do you think it would be effective in increasing security levels?

**Answer:**

The concept you are describing is known as "port knocking." Port knocking involves a series of closed ports being "knocked" (i.e., attempted connections) in a specific sequence to trigger the opening of a previously closed port. This can add an additional layer of security by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to discover and access the SSH port.

Here is an article that provides a detailed guide on how to implement port knocking on Ubuntu:
- [How to Use Port Knocking to Hide Your SSH Daemon from Attackers on Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-port-knocking-to-hide-your-ssh-daemon-from-attackers-on-ubuntu)

However, it is important to note that port knocking is a form of "security by obscurity," which means it relies on the secrecy of the port sequence rather than strong cryptographic methods. While it can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit the SSH port, it does not inherently make your system more secure.

For a more robust security approach, consider the following alternatives:

1. **Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Set up a VPN with SSL certificates for authentication. This allows you to securely connect to your network and then access the SSH server. This method ensures that only authorized users can reach the SSH port.

2. **Restrict Access to Trusted IPs:** Limit SSH access to a specific range of trusted IP addresses. This reduces the attack surface and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access.

By combining these methods, you can significantly enhance the security of your SSH remote access while maintaining the necessary level of accessibility.
