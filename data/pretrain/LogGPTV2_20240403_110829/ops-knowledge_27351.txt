User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题there is any port opening script or solution to increase security? I mean port is opened just when some port sequence detected on log In order to increase security, for example on ssh remote connections, I:


open a non stardard port.
use mandatory digital certificates for authentication.
allow connection from a ip range only.


But I wonder if this is enough to protect my ssh remote access. I was wondering if there is any script or solution doing this:


listen on syslog and filter ssh access intents.
if a predefined ports sequence is detected, then open for some minutes your non standard ssh port, then close it again if there is no active session.


So this is a "ports key" implementation. Do you know if a similar solution exists? Do you think such a tool is interesting to increase security levels?

Assistant: Here is an article about port-knocking: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-port-knocking-to-hide-your-ssh-daemon-from-attackers-on-ubuntu

And as schroeder said above - this is security by obscurity, it does not make your system more secure. If you are looking for securing your box and still need access to it from any IP address, consider using VPN with SSL certificates to authenticate against the system and then connect to your SSH server. Otherwise just allow access to your SSH from a range of trusted IPs.
