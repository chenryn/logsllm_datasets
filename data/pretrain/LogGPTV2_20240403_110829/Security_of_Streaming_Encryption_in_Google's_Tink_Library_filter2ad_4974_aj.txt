We now will justify Eq. (6) above. In the real system S1, the first 𝑖 − 1 queries lead to 2(𝑖 − 1)
random-permutation calls, and let 𝑉 = (𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉2𝑖−2) be the list of the outputs of those calls. For
𝑣 ∈ ({0, 1}𝑛)2𝑖−2, we write pS1,𝐴(𝑥 | 𝑉 = 𝑣) to denote the conditional probability that the 𝑖-th
answer is 𝑥, given that 𝑉 = 𝑣. Let 𝑊 be the random variable that if 𝑉 takes value 𝑣 then 𝑊 takes
value pS1,𝐴(𝑥 | 𝑉 = 𝑣). Since 𝑉 uniquely determines 𝑋 𝑖−1,
𝑌𝑖,𝑥 = E[𝑊 | 𝑋 𝑖−1] .
From the fact that the function 𝜌(𝑥) = (𝑥 − 1/(2𝑛 − 1))2 is convex, using Jensen’s inequality for

The single-user case. It is instructive to first consider the case that the adversary 𝒜 targets
only a single user. In this case, we actually can give a much stronger concentration bound on 𝑊.

Note that in this single-user setting, 𝑉1, . . . , 𝑉2𝑖−2 are sampled uniformly without replacement from
{0, 1}𝑛. For each 𝑗 ≤ 2𝑖 − 2, let 𝐵𝑗 be the Bernoulli random variable such that 𝐵𝑗 = 1 if and only
if 𝑉𝑗 ∈ {𝑉1 ⊕ 𝑥, . . . , 𝑉𝑗−1 ⊕ 𝑥}. Let 𝐷 = 2(𝐵1 + ··· + 𝐵2𝑖−2). We will use the following result that
is implicit in the work of Dai, Hoang, and Tessaro [10].

⃒⃒𝐵1 + ··· + 𝐵𝑗 − 𝑗2/2𝑛+1⃒⃒ ≤ 4√︀𝑗𝑛 .
Combining this for 𝑗 = 2𝑖−2 and Lemma 8 leads to Eq. (8). We prove this claim by induction on 𝑗.
The base case 𝑗 = 1 obviously holds, since 𝐵1 = 0. Now, suppose that the claim holds for 𝑗 − 1, we
shall prove that it holds for 𝑗 as well. Let 𝑇0 = 0 and 𝑇𝑟 = 𝑇𝑟−1 + 𝐵𝑟 − E[𝐵𝑟 | 𝐵1, . . . , 𝐵𝑟−1] for
every 1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑗. Since 𝐵1, . . . , 𝐵𝑟−1 completely determine 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑟−1,
E[𝑇𝑟 | 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑟−1] = E[︁
𝑇𝑟−1 + 𝐵𝑟 − E[𝐵𝑟 | 𝐵1, . . . , 𝐵𝑟−1] | 𝑇1, . . . , 𝑇𝑟−1

where the first inequality is due to the fact that 𝐵𝑟 ≥ 0, and the second inequality is due to the
fact that 𝐵𝑟 ≤ 1. Thus |𝑇𝑟| ≤ 𝑟, and therefore E[|𝑇𝑟|] < ∞. Hence (𝑇0, . . . , 𝑇𝑗) is a martingale.

From Eq. (9) and the induction hypothesis, this happens with probability at least 1 − 𝑗/𝑒4.5𝑛. We
now show that
