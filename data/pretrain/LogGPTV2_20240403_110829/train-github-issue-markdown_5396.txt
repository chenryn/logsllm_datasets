### Expected Behavior
BrowserView should fill the available space in BrowserWindow when application
window size is changed when it has been set to autoresize view according to
BrowserWindow width/height.
### Actual Behavior
BrowserView does fill the available space, but leaves small gaps to the
right/bottom side of the view. Gap size is relative to how much the size is
enlarged. This happens only in Windows. On Linux there are no gaps and
changing window size works without  
issues.
