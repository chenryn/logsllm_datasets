This is a problem with the documentation of threejs, not threejs itself, I got
redirected by the IRC chat by a red colored user "bai" to place this bug here.
# Steps:
  1. go to https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/lights/DirectionalLight
  2. Press middle mouse button on any link on the page, for example `DirectionalLightShadow`
# Expection:
Since it has the pointer cursor, I expect the browser to open the page on a
new tab
# Reality:
The browser executes the scroll using middle mouse button interaction
# Why is this a problem
This is a problem because when new developers come to the documentation, and
seeing an first impression from breaking the UX flow most people are used
with, is a bad sign and encourages new people to go away.
