Abstract-  The  world  is  undergoing  a  dramatic  rapid  transformation  from  isolated  systems  to 
ubiquitous Internet-based-enabled ‘things’ capable of interacting each other and generating data that 
can be analyzed to extract valuable information. This highly interconnected global network structure 
known  as  Internet  of  Things  will  enrich  everyone’s  life,  increase  business  productivity,  improve 
government efficiency, and the list just goes on. However, this new reality (IoT) built on the basis of 
Internet, contains new kind of challenges from a security and privacy perspective. Traditional security 
primitives  cannot  be  directly  applied  to  IoT  technologies  due  to  the  different  standards  and 
communication stacks involved.

based-enabled ‘things’ capable of interacting each other and 
generating  data  that  can  be  analyzed  to  extract  valuable 
information.  This  highly 
interconnected  global  network

on the basis of Internet, contains new kind of challenges from 
a  security  and  privacy  perspective.  Traditional  security 
primitives cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to 
the  different  standards  and  communication  stacks  involved. 
Along  with  scalability  and  heterogeneity  issues,  major  part  of 
IoT  infrastructure  consists  of  resource  constrained  devices 
such as RFIDs and wireless sensor nodes. Therefore, a flexible 
infrastructure  is  required  capable  to  deal  with  security  and 
privacy  issues  in  such  a  dynamic  environment.  This  paper 
presents  an  overview  of  IoT,  security  and  privacy  challenges 
and the existing security solutions and identifying some open 
issues for future research.

he  most  profound  technologies  are  those  that 
disappear.  They  weave  themselves  into  the  fabric 
of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from 
it”.  This  was  Mark  Weiser’s  central  statement  in  his 
seminal paper [Weis 91] in Scientific American in 1991. 
IoT  concept  has  begun  to  shape  our  modern  world 
including a common man’s everyday life in the society, a 
world  in  which  devices  of  every  shape  and  size  are 
manufactured  with  “smart”  capabilities  that  allow  them 
to
communicate and interact not only with other devices 
but  also  with  humans,  exchange  their  data,  make 
autonomous decisions and perform useful tasks based 
on  preset  conditions.  IoT  is  becoming  well-known 
concept  across  many  horizontal  and  vertical  markets 
with  its  numerous  applications  [1].Just  to  give  an 
example  how  IoT  would  affect  our  daily  life:  You  enter 
the supermarket and receive your fridge’s text message:

your grocery cart that you’ve taken a milk carton. As you 
walk  towards  the  pharmacy,  your  fitness  wristband

communication 
The  early  years  of  Internet  of  Things  (IoT) 
started with Machine to Machine (M2M) communication. 
M2M 
two  machines 
communicating  with  each  other,  usually  without  human 
involvement.  The  communication  platform 
is  not 
defined,  and  can  be  both  wireless  and  wired 
communication.  The  term  M2M  stems  from  telephony 
systems.  In  these  systems,  different  endpoints  needed 
to  exchange  information  between  each  other,  such  as 
the  identity  of  the  caller.  This  information  was  sent 
between  the  endpoints  without  a  human  being  needed 
to  initiate  the  transmission.  The  M2M  term  is  still  very 
much  in  use,  especially  in  the  industrial  market,  and  is 
commonly regarded as a subset of IoT [5]. 
The  term  internet  of  things  was  devised  by 
Kevin Ashton, cofounder and executive director of Auto-
ID  Center  at  MIT  in  1999  and  refers  to  uniquely 
identifiable objects and their virtual representations in an 
“internet-like”  structure  [25].  The  Oxford  Dictionary 
perhaps  offers  a  concise  definition  that  invokes  the 
Internet as an element of the IoT:  
Internet  of  things  (noun):  The interconnection via  the 
Internet  of  computing  devices  embedded  in  everyday 
objects enabling them to send and receive data. 
Nevertheless,  in  the  past  decade,  this  concept 
has  been  extended  because  of  new  IoT  network 
applications such as e-healthcare and transport utilities 
[25].  The  evolution  of  the  IoT  has  its  origin  in  the 
convergence of wireless technologies, advancements of 
micro  electromechanical  systems  (MEMS)  and  digital 
electronics where has been as a result miniature devices 
with the ability to sense and compute and communicate 
wirelessly. In the era of IoT, the interaction or relationship 
between  humans  and  machines 
is  ever  more 
considered as machines getting smarter and starting to 
handle more human tasks, and in this situation humans

are  required  to  trust  the  machine  and  feel  safe.  In  this 
way, a thing might be a patient with a medical implant to 
facilitate real-time monitoring in a healthcare application 
or an accelerometer for movement attached to the cow 
in a farm environment [26]. 
These  things  or  devices  in  IoT  include  familiar 
scannables and wearables and more complex systems 
like  home  appliances,  vehicles,  and  smart  roads  and 
bridges.  It  is predicted that  IoT  will  consist  of  50  billion 
connected devices by 2020 and that the worldwide IoT 
market  will  be  more  than  a $10  trillion  industry.  These 
projections  depict  the  possibility  of  a  smarter,  efficient 
and  safer  world  of  inter-connected  devices  [27]  while 
the  hacking  of 
some observers show concerns that the IoT represents 
a  darker  world  of  surveillance,  privacy  and  security 
violations,  and  consumer  lock–in.  Attention-grabbing 
headlines  about 
internet-connected 
automobiles,  surveillance  concerns  arising  from  voice 
recognition  features  in  “smart”  TVs,  and  privacy  fears 
stemming  from  the  potential  misuse  of  IoT  data  have 
captured  public  attention.  This  “promise  vs.  peril” 
debate  along  with  an  influx  of  information  though 
popular  media  and  marketing  can  make  the  IoT  a 
complex topic to understand [22]. 
Figure 1: Hyper Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2105[12]
Garter’s  Hype  Cycle  is  a  way  to  represent 
emergence,  adoption,  maturity  and 
impact  on 
applications of specific technologies. The latest Gartner 
Hype Cycle for Emerging  Technologies places it at  the 
peak.  IoT  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  emerging 
technologies  as  shown  below  in  the  Hype  Cycle  in 
Emerging Technologies Report for the year 2015[28]. 
II.  Security for Internet of Things 
If  one  thing  can  prevent  the  Internet  of  things 
from transforming the  way  we  live  and  work,  it  will  be 
a breakdown in  security.  While  security  considerations 
are not new in the context of information technology, the 
attributes of many IoT implementations present new and 
unique  security  challenges.  Addressing  these  challen- 
ges and ensuring security in IoT products and services 
must be a fundamental priority. Users need to trust that 
IoT  devices  and  related  data  services  are  secure  from 
vulnerabilities,  especially  as  this  technology  become 
more  pervasive  and  integrated  into  our  daily  lives. 
Important  challenge

mechanisms  and  the  user  acceptance.  User  must  feel 
that they control any information that is related to them

The interconnected nature of IoT devices means 
that  every  poorly  secured  device  that  is  connected 
online  potentially  affects  the  security  and  resilience  of 
the Internet globally. This challenge is amplified by other 
considerations

users  of  IoT  devices  and  systems  have  a  collective 
obligation  to  ensure  they  do  not  expose  users  and  the 
IoT infrastructure itself to potential harm. Accordingly, a 
collaborative  approach  to  security  will  be  needed  to 
develop  effective  and  appropriate  solutions  to  IoT 
security challenges that are well suited to the scale and 
complexity of the issues [22].

adoption  of  the  Internet  of  Things.  This  means  that 
privacy rights and respect for user privacy expectations 
are integral to ensuring user trust and confidence in the 
Internet, connected devices, and related services. Inde- 
ed, the Internet of Things is redefining the debate about 
privacy  issues,  as  many  implementations  can  drama- 
tically  change  the  ways  personal  data  is  collected, 
analyzed,  used,  and  protected.  For  example,  IoT  amp- 
lifies  concerns  about  the  potential  for  increased  survei- 
llance and tracking, difficulty in being able to opt out of 
certain data collection, and the strength of aggregating 
IoT  data  streams  to  paint  detailed  digital  portraits  of 
users.  While  these  are  important  challenges,  they  are 
not insurmountable. In order to realize the opportunities, 
strategies  will  need 
to  respect 
individual  privacy  choices  across  a  broad  spectrum  of 
expectations,  while  still  fostering  innovation  in  new 
technology and services [22]. 
to  be  developed 
The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  organized  as 
follows:  Section  II  further  gives  an  overview  of  the  IoT 
in 
terms  of 
features, layers; we first identify properties that make the 
IoT  unique 
the  security  and  privacy 
challenges. In the next section, we describe the security 
primitives  and  solutions  approaches  that  take  into 
account  to  secure  the  network  communication  and 
protect  user’s  data.  Finally,  Section  IV  concludes  the 
paper  and  gives  insights  regarding  current  research 
gaps and possible future directions. 
a) 
IoT Features And Security Requirements 
In  this  section,  we  identify  the  features  that 
constitute  the  uniqueness  of  the  IoT  in  terms  of  the 
security  and  privacy  challenges  and  the  layers  of  IoT. 
We  will  see  how  security  issues  are  different  in  IoT  as 
compared to traditional internet networks. Moreover, we 
will  establish  a  number  of  security  and  privacy 
requirements,  based  on  the  described  properties,  and 
will discuss them in detail. 
Figure 2: Internet of Things Applications 
In  contrast  to  traditional  IT  systems  such  as 
enterprise applications, cloud computing, and big data, 
a combination of a number of properties makes the IoT 
unique in terms of the challenges that need to be coped 
with.  We  identify  these  properties  by  analyzing  related 
IoT  research  [29]–[30].  A  major  barrier  to  realizing  the 
full promise of IoT is that around 85% of existing things 
were  not  designed  to  connect  to  Internet  and  cannot 
share  data  with  the  cloud  according  to  IMS  research. 
Addressing  this  issue,  gateways  from  mobile,  home, 
and  industrial  act  as  intermediaries  between  legacy 
things and the cloud, providing the needed connectivity, 
security and manageability described by Intel. 
The identified distinguishing properties are four, namely: 
the  uncontrolled  environment,  the  heteroge-  neity,  the 
need for scalability, as well as the constrained resources 
utilized in the IoT
Many things will be part of a

presence cannot be expected in such an environment. 
Physical  Accessibility:  In  the  IoT,  sensors  can  be 
publicly  accessible,  e.g.,  traffic  control  cameras,  and 
environmental sensors.
Trust:
A  priori  trusted  relationships  are  unlikely  for  the 
large amount of devices interacting with each other and 
users  [22].  Thus,  automated  mechanisms  to  measure 
and  manage  trust  of  things,  services,  and  users  are 
crucial for the IoT.
Heterogeneity:
to  be  a  highly 
heterogeneous  ecosystem  as  it  will  have  to  integrate  a 
multitude  of 
from  various  manufacturers. 
Therefore,  version  compatibility,  and 
interoperability 
have to be considered. 
Scalability:
The vast amount of interconnected things in 
the  IoT  demands  highly  scalable  protocols.  This  also 
has an influence on security mechanisms. For instance, 
centralized  approaches,  e.g.,  hierarchical  Public  Key 
Infrastructures  (PKIs),  as  well  as  some  distributed 
approaches,  e.g.,  pairwise  symmetric  key  exchange 
schemes, cannot scale with the IoT.
