### Abstract
The world is experiencing a rapid transformation from isolated systems to a ubiquitous, Internet-based network of "things" capable of interacting with each other and generating data that can be analyzed for valuable insights. This highly interconnected global network, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), promises to enrich lives, increase business productivity, and improve government efficiency. However, this new reality, built on the foundation of the Internet, presents unique security and privacy challenges. Traditional security measures cannot be directly applied to IoT technologies due to the variety of standards and communication stacks involved. This paper provides an overview of IoT, its security and privacy challenges, and existing security solutions, while also identifying open issues for future research.

### Introduction
"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it." â€” Mark Weiser, 1991

The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping our modern world, including the daily lives of individuals. Devices of all shapes and sizes are being manufactured with "smart" capabilities, allowing them to communicate and interact with other devices and humans, exchange data, make autonomous decisions, and perform useful tasks based on preset conditions. IoT is becoming increasingly prevalent across various markets, with numerous applications. For example, imagine entering a supermarket and receiving a text message from your fridge: "You are out of milk." In the dairy section, sensors signal your grocery cart that you've taken a milk carton. As you walk towards the pharmacy, your fitness wristband vibrates, taking your vitals and streaming the results to your doctor to adjust your prescription. When you're finished shopping, you simply walk out the door, and your credit card is charged as you exit the supermarket's geofence. As you drive home, your car communicates with other cars on the road to prevent accidents.

### Early Years of IoT
The early years of IoT began with Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication, where two machines communicate with each other without human intervention. M2M communication was initially used in telephony systems, where different endpoints needed to exchange information, such as the identity of the caller, without human involvement. The term M2M is still widely used, especially in the industrial market, and is considered a subset of IoT.

The term "Internet of Things" was coined by Kevin Ashton, co-founder and executive director of Auto-ID Center at MIT in 1999. It refers to uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representations in an "internet-like" structure. The Oxford Dictionary defines IoT as the interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. Over the past decade, the concept has expanded to include new IoT network applications such as e-healthcare and transport utilities.

### Evolution of IoT
The evolution of IoT is driven by the convergence of wireless technologies, advancements in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and digital electronics. These advancements have led to the development of miniature devices capable of sensing, computing, and communicating wirelessly. In the era of IoT, the interaction between humans and machines is evolving, with machines becoming smarter and handling more human tasks. Trust and safety are essential in this relationship. For instance, a medical implant in a patient can facilitate real-time monitoring in healthcare applications, or an accelerometer attached to a cow can monitor movement in a farm environment.

### IoT Devices and Applications
IoT devices range from familiar scannables and wearables to more complex systems like home appliances, vehicles, and smart roads and bridges. It is predicted that by 2020, IoT will consist of 50 billion connected devices, and the worldwide IoT market will be worth over $10 trillion. While these projections promise a smarter, more efficient, and safer world, concerns about surveillance, privacy, and security violations persist. Headlines about internet-connected automobiles, voice recognition features in "smart" TVs, and privacy fears stemming from the potential misuse of IoT data have captured public attention. The debate between the promise and peril of IoT, along with the influx of information through popular media and marketing, makes IoT a complex topic to understand.

### Security for IoT
Security is a critical concern for the Internet of Things. While security considerations are not new in information technology, the attributes of many IoT implementations present unique security challenges. Ensuring security in IoT products and services must be a fundamental priority. Users need to trust that IoT devices and related data services are secure from vulnerabilities, especially as this technology becomes more pervasive and integrated into daily lives. Key challenges include the integration of security mechanisms and user acceptance. Users must feel in control of their information rather than feeling controlled by the system.

The interconnected nature of IoT devices means that every poorly secured device connected online potentially affects the security and resilience of the Internet globally. This challenge is amplified by the mass-scale deployment of homogeneous IoT devices, the ability of some devices to automatically connect to unsecure environments, and the likelihood of fielding these devices in uncontrolled settings. Developers and users of IoT devices and systems have a collective obligation to ensure they do not expose users and the IoT infrastructure to potential harm. A collaborative approach to security is necessary to develop effective and appropriate solutions to IoT security challenges.

### Privacy in IoT
The full potential of IoT depends on strategies that respect individual privacy choices across a broad spectrum of expectations. The data streams and user specificity afforded by IoT devices can unlock incredible and unique value for users, but concerns about privacy and potential harms might hold back full adoption. Privacy rights and respect for user privacy expectations are integral to ensuring user trust and confidence in the Internet, connected devices, and related services. IoT is redefining the debate about privacy issues, as many implementations can dramatically change the ways personal data is collected, analyzed, used, and protected. For example, IoT amplifies concerns about increased surveillance and tracking, difficulty in opting out of certain data collection, and the strength of aggregating IoT data streams to paint detailed digital portraits of users. While these challenges are significant, they are not insurmountable. Strategies need to be developed to respect individual privacy choices while fostering innovation in new technologies and services.

### Structure of the Paper
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
- **Section II** provides an overview of IoT in terms of its features, layers, and the properties that make it unique in terms of security and privacy challenges.
- **Section III** describes the security primitives and solution approaches that take into account securing network communication and protecting user data.
- **Section IV** concludes the paper and provides insights regarding current research gaps and possible future directions.

### IoT Features and Security Requirements
In this section, we identify the features that constitute the uniqueness of IoT in terms of security and privacy challenges and the layers of IoT. We will see how security issues differ in IoT compared to traditional internet networks. We will establish a number of security and privacy requirements based on the described properties and discuss them in detail.

#### Uncontrolled Environment
Many things in IoT will be part of a highly uncontrolled environment, often traveling to untrustworthy surroundings, possibly without supervision. Stable network connectivity and constant presence cannot be expected in such an environment. Sensors in IoT can be publicly accessible, such as traffic control cameras and environmental sensors. A priori trusted relationships are unlikely for the large number of devices interacting with each other and users. Automated mechanisms to measure and manage trust of things, services, and users are crucial for IoT.

#### Heterogeneity
IoT is expected to be a highly heterogeneous ecosystem, integrating a multitude of devices from various manufacturers. Version compatibility and interoperability must be considered.

#### Scalability
The vast amount of interconnected things in IoT demands highly scalable protocols. Centralized approaches, such as hierarchical Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), and some distributed approaches, such as pairwise symmetric key exchange schemes, may not scale effectively with the IoT.

### Conclusion
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on its security and privacy requirements and the existing solution approaches. While IoT promises to transform our lives, it also presents significant security and privacy challenges. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative and innovative approach to ensure the safe and secure integration of IoT into our daily lives. Future research should focus on developing robust security and privacy mechanisms that can scale with the growing number of IoT devices and applications.
