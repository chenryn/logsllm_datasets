and 9.5 % many times. Those who had received similar notifications
explained that they were from sign-ins on other devices (20.0 %) or
financial services (13.3 %).

5 PASSWORD-REUSE NOTIFICATION GOALS
Password-reuse notifications take on a challenging task as the situ-
ation at hand is the cumulative result of multiple parties’ actions.
Further, the level of risk to convey and the appropriate actions
to suggest or require are not always clear. While research has in-
vestigated best practices for other types of security notifications
(cf. Section 2), we sought to create a framework for evaluating
password-reuse notifications. Drawing on the Study 1 results, we
identified five goals that effective notifications should achieve suffi-
ciently: timeliness, legitimacy, action, background, and trust. We
used these goals as a framework to evaluate notifications in Study 2.
First, notifications should reach their intended audience in a
timely manner. A notification about a compromised password is
only useful if the user sees the notification to create a new one.
Second, notifications should be perceived as legitimate. Some
respondents in Study 1 were hesitant to trust our notifications,
believing that they might be phishing. The presence of hyperlinks
was cited as an indicator of phishing, and a few respondents were
skeptical of any email that required password changes at all.
Third, a password-reuse notification should lead to actions that
improve the security of the directly affected online account. Ideally,
this would include taking productive actions for other accounts
that may be at risk (i.e., those where similar passwords were used),
as well as advising against unproductive or unrelated actions.
Fourth, the background information provided by a notification
should be easily understood. In Study 1, 12.8 % of respondents were
confused by how one service “got” their passwords for another
service, which could potentially lead to confusion. Not all users will
understand the mechanisms behind password databases or cryp-
tographic hashes, but the root cause of the notification (password
reuse) must be clearly conveyed.
Fifth and finally, notifications should improve trust between
providers and users. Account providers send notifications to in-
crease the security of users’ accounts with that provider, as well
as potentially with other providers, too. Therefore, notifications
should aim to engender users’ trust.
6 STUDY 2
In Study 1, we found that the content of a password-reuse notifica-
tion impacted respondents’ understanding of the situation at hand,
as well as whether they would intend to take action in response.
In Study 2, we sought to better isolate the factors of effective noti-
fications by exploring the impact of making small changes to the
content or delivery of these notifications. Our design of Study 2
focuses on key results from Study 1, along with the goals outlined
in Section 5. We had six core research questions for Study 2.
First, we consider the delivery medium. The timeliness of a
notification is largely determined by how it is sent to the recipient.
Mobile push notifications interrupt the current workflow, whereas
emails or in-app notifications require users to actively check those
sources. The delivery medium of the notification may also change
respondents’ perception of the legitimacy of the notification.
RQ 1A: How does the delivery medium of a password-reuse notifi-
cation affect its perceived effectiveness?
RQ 1B: If you, an online account provider, are breached, how impor-
tant is the delivery medium in which you send your notification?
Next, we consider mentions of suspicious account activity and
the nature of the data breach. These details address the goal of pro-
viding adequate background for users to understand the situation.
RQ 2: How does explicitly identifying the root causes of the incident
influence the notification’s effectiveness?
RQ 3: How does mentioning suspicious account activity influence
the notification’s effectiveness?
Depending on the importance of the account and the incident,
notifications should force a password reset.
RQ 4: If a password change is only recommended, instead of re-
quired, will users report that they would change their passwords?
Finally, we consider various security suggestions beyond pass-
word changes. We hypothesize that these suggestions could im-
prove the user’s trust in the account provider by appearing to
demonstrate proactive approaches to security.
RQ 5A: Is it important to explicitly recommend password changes
on other sites in a notification?
RQ 5B: Is it important to explicitly recommend pro-security actions
(e.g., 2FA, adopting a password manager) in a notification?
RQ 5C: If your service is breached, is it important to explicitly
recommend password changes on other sites and pro-security be-
haviors beyond changing your password?
RQ 6: Will users report taking pro-security actions if they are not
explicitly mentioned in a password-reuse notification?
6.1 Study 2 Conditions
We began developing our Study 2 conditions by creating a model
notification (shown in Figure 4) that synthesized the individual as-
pects of notifications that were most successful in Study 1, filling in
gaps relative to our aforementioned design goals. To disambiguate
the impact of each aspect of the model notification’s content and de-
livery, we created 14 additional variants of the model, each of which
differed in a targeted way. These variants, as detailed in Table 2,
reflect changes in the delivery method, description of the secu-
rity incident, mention of account activity, suggested remediation,
reference to other accounts, and additional pro-security actions
mentioned. Each respondent was randomly assigned to see either
the model notification or one of these fourteen variants. When
presenting our results, we refer to these variants using multi-part
names based on the nomenclature defined in Table 2. Special at-
tention was given to increase the likelihood that our respondents
perceived the notification as legitimate, rather than as phishing.
Appendix B.2 contains additional images of the variants.
6.2 Study 2 Structure and Recruitment
We recruited respondents on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, again
advertising a survey about online account notifications with no
mention of security or privacy. Requirements for participation were
the same as for Study 1, and participation in both Study 1 and
Study 2 was prevented. The survey was again scenario-based, but
this survey was structured into five sections and added additional
questions to explore topics raised during the analysis of Study 1.
Each respondent was compensated with $2.50 for completing the
15-minute survey. Respondents were introduced to the survey sce-
nario with the same text as Study 1 (cf. Section 3.1) and were then
presented with their assigned notification.
The first section of survey questions measured respondents’
overall reported conceptions of the notification with questions
similar to Study 1, but with a key modification: respondents were
given eleven closed-answer choices of the causes of receiving the
notification. We chose to give closed-answer choices to measure
explicitly whether or not they expected some factor might have
caused the situation, rather than relying just on what they thought
to write. We based these choices on the responses to Study 1’s
open-ended version.
The second section asked whether respondents would intend to
change their passwords for AcmeCo, as well as for other accounts.
This section also contained follow-up questions about why they
would or would not intend to change their passwords, as well as
how they would create and memorize such passwords. The third
section asked them to report their security perceptions of, and
likelihood to take, ten actions beyond changing their password.
These actions were again closed-answer and were selected based
on free-text responses from Study 1.
The fourth section asked respondents about their perceptions
of the notification with questions based on the corresponding sec-
tion from Study 1 but modified to align with Study 2’s research
questions. The final section solicited the following demographic
information: gender, age, highest educational degree attained, and
technical expertise. We also asked respondents to report any pre-
vious experiences being notified about data breaches and history
of having others gain unauthorized access to their online accounts.
Appendix A.2 contains the survey text. As in Study 1, responses
are reported behavioral intentions, rather than actual behavior. We
again mitigated biases with softening language and pre-testing.
6.3 Analysis Method and Metrics
We again use regression models in our analysis. We had both bi-
nary (whether respondents selected each of the eleven potential
causes, whether respondents reported intending to change any pass-
words or take the ten additional actions) and ordinal (responses
on scales regarding perceptions of the notification, as well as a
Likert-scale agreement with the security benefit of the ten actions)
dependent variables. For binary dependent variables, we built lo-
gistic regression models. For ordinal dependent variables, we built
ordinal logistic regression models. The independent variables were
the notification, all covariates used in Study 1 (the respondent’s age
range, gender, education level, and technical background), whether
the respondent had ever been notified that their information was
exposed in a data breach and whether the respondent had experi-
enced unauthorized access to an online account. These final two
variables are proxies for prior experience with breaches [47, 49].
All independent variables were treated as categorical.
As in Study 1, we built parsimonious models through backward
elimination. The full regression tables are again contained in our
companion technical report. To determine whether the omnibus
notification term was significant, we compared these final models
to their analogous null models (removing the notification term) to
calculate an omnibus p-value, which we report as the regression
p-value. If the notification term was removed in backward elimina-
tion, we treated the notification as non-significant. For significant
individual factors, we report the odds ratio and p-value.
When the omnibus notification term was significant, we made
18 comparisons between pairs of notifications to investigate our
six research questions directly. For ordinal data, we used Mann-
Whitney U tests (reporting U and the p-value). For categorical data
more naturally expressed as a contingency table (e.g., whether and
how respondents intended to change their password), we performed
χ2 tests if all cell counts were greater than five, and Fisher’s Exact
Test (denoted FET) if they were not. We again set α = .05 and used
Holm correction within each family of tests.
Finally, in a process analogous to that for Study 1, we qualita-
tively coded free-response data.
7 STUDY 2 RESULTS
Across all variants of the model notification, respondents reported
anticipating serious consequences to ignoring the notification and
reported believing that changing their password would benefit
their account security. While a majority of respondents indicated
that they would intend to change their passwords, their intended
password creation strategies would continue to expose them to
password-reuse attacks. Unfortunately, many respondents did not
perceive password reuse to be the root cause of the situation.
We found that adding extra security suggestions increases per-
ceived risks, which may help the notification convey the seriousness
of the situation and the need to take action. Omitting information
about account activity or being vague about the origin of the secu-
rity incident, however, warps perceptions of the situation.
7.1 Respondents
There were 588 respondents in Study 2. Most respondents were be-
tween the ages of 25 and 34 (44.6 %), although 11.2 % were younger
and 44.1 % were older. 48.4 % of the respondents identified as fe-
male. Over half of our respondents had a two- or four-year degree,
and 10.8 % held higher degrees. A quarter of respondents reported
experience (education or job) in technical fields.
53.2 % of respondents in Study 2 indicated that they had been
affected by a prior data breach. Most respondents were notified via
email (55.9 %), although receiving physical mail (17.3 %) and reading
the news or browsing social media (18.2 %) were other common
notification methods. The most common data breach mentioned
by respondents was Equifax (12.1 % of respondents). Less than one-
third of respondents reported unauthorized access to an account.
Of the 188 respondents that reported someone had gained unau-
thorized access to one of their online accounts, 23 personally knew
the attacker, whereas 155 did not.
7.2 Perceived Causes of the Scenario
Many respondents did not perceive password reuse to be a
cause of the situation. From among eleven potential causes of
receiving the notification, we asked respondents to choose all they
felt applied. Unfortunately, across all notifications, a minority of
respondents chose “you reused the same or similar passwords for
multiple online accounts” as a potential cause even though many
variants of the notification mentioned password reuse. For exam-
ple, the model notification (control condition) explained that their
“AcmeCo account login and password may have been compromised”
due to a data breach of a service unrelated to AcmeCo “because
many people reuse similar passwords on multiple sites.” Nonethe-
less, only 44.7 % of respondents who saw the model notification
chose password reuse as a cause of receiving the notification.
The rate of selecting password reuse as a cause varied by condi-
tion (regression p < .001). Among all variants, model-{suspicious}
(named using the keywords in Table 2) was most effective at con-
veying that password reuse was a potential cause. This variant
augmented the model notification by noting suspicious activity had
been detected on the account. Nonetheless, only 57.9 % of respon-
dents chose password reuse as a possible cause, which did not differ
significantly from the control. Unsurprisingly, four variants that
mentioned that AcmeCo itself suffered a breach had significantly
lower rates of choosing password reuse as a cause: model-{usBreach}-
-{mobile} (2.4 %, OR = 0.03, p < 0.001); model-{usBreach}-{inApp}
(2.4 %, OR = 0.03, p = 0.001); model-{usBreach}-{noOthers} (10.0 %,
OR = 0.13, p = 0.001); and model-{usBreach}-{noOthers}-{noExtras}
(2.6 %, OR = 0.03, p = 0.001).
For model-{vagueCause}, 10.3 % of respondents chose password
reuse as a cause, which was also significantly lower than the control
(OR = 0.16, p = 0.003). This is notable because that notification
mentions a vaguely-worded “potential security incident” that may
have led to a credential compromise, typical of many widely de-
ployed notifications even when password reuse is the culprit.
Respondents also rarely chose “you have a weak password for
your AcmeCo account” as a potential cause. Across conditions, only
15.0 % of respondents selected this option. This did vary significantly
by condition (regression p = .011), though we only observed a
significant difference for the pair of conditions investigating the
impact of mentioning suspicious activity (RQ3). While 38.9 % of
respondents indicated a weak password as a potential cause for
model-{suspicious}, which mentioned suspicious activity, only 4.9 %
did so for model-{omitActivity}, which did not (FET, p = .009).
In contrast, across all notifications, respondents most commonly
chose that “AcmeCo was hacked” (49.0 % of respondents) or that a
company unrelated to AcmeCo was hacked (41.7 %). Note, however,
that conditions varied in whether they reported that AcmeCo or
some other company was breached, so these frequencies and the sig-
nificant differences between conditions (both regressions p < .001)
are unsurprising. More surprisingly, across conditions respondents
selected three additional potential causes at higher rates than pass-
word reuse: “Someone hacked your AcmeCo account” (32.5 % of
respondents); “AcmeCo conducts regular security checks and this
is just a standard security notification” (28.2 %); “Someone is trying
to gain unauthorized access to your account by sending this email”
(27.4 %). These did not vary significantly across conditions.
7.3 Creating New Passwords
Respondents rated whether fifteen potential actions would improve
their account security. Six of these actions related to password
changes. In addition, respondents selected whether or not “if [they]
received this notification about an online account [they] had with
a real company” they would change their password for that com-
pany. For brevity, we refer to this below as changing their AcmeCo
password. We also asked them to report their likelihood to take five
