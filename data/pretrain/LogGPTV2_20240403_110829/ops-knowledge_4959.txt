User: I am familiar with R but new to Python. 
To use python, I installed Python 2.7, set environment variables and installed wxPython. And then, after installing Ulipad I opened Ulipad but an  error message showed this:

The logfile 'C:\program file(x86)\Ulipad\Ulipad.exe.log' could not be opened:[Errno13] Permission denied: 'C:\program file(x86)\Ulipad\Ulipad.exe.log' 
  


Can you help me to open the Ulipad? Or Is there any other good program like Ulipad? 
I am not good at programming but only familiar with R. Python seems to be little different from R in an interface.
Assistant: I had the same problem and the solution was:

uninstall Ulipad
install Ulipad on a different disk, e.g. D:\Ulipad
