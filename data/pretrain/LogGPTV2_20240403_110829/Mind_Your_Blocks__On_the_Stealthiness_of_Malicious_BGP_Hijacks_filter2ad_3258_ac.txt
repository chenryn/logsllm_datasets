cases apparently performed by a Russian spammer.
We believe that others are still hidden in our dataset.
However, ﬁguring out how to ﬁnd them all is left as
an exercise for future work.
This paper does not discuss the optimal choice of
the few parameters used in our algorithms. Running
a rigorous sensitivity analysis to further improve our
results is something we are working on. However, the
key contribution of this paper is not the method itself
but, instead, the identiﬁcation of real malicious attacks
routinely happening in the wild.
The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2
presents the related work. Section 3 describes the environ-
mental setup we have built, namely the data collection and
analysis processes. Section 4 is the core of the paper and
goes into the details of all the results obtained when using
this environment for several months. Section 5 offers some
insights on the effectiveness of current counter-measures to
defeat the attacks we have found. Section 6 summarizes the
lessons learned and concludes the paper.
II. RELATED WORK
BGP hijacking defense solutions are twofold: (i) detection
techniques aim at monitoring the Internet routing infrastructure
and trigger alarms upon abnormal routing changes, and (ii)
other techniques aim at providing BGP with new mechanisms
to mitigate or prevent hijacking. Unlike hijack mitigation or
prevention techniques, detection methods require no changes to
router software, which usually makes them readily and easily
deployable.
Some techniques have been proposed to bring security
into BGP [24], [25], [30], usually using cryptography to sign
some elements of BGP updates to ensure routing information
authenticity and integrity. In the last few years a BGP security
framework relying on a RPKI [31] to secure IP preﬁx origina-
tion [24] has gained a lot of attention and is now progressively
being deployed.
Alternatively, some existing proposals [29], [26], [28], [34]
aim at detecting IP preﬁx hijacking by passively monitoring
the routing infrastructure. However due to the strong similar-
ity between IP preﬁx hijacking and some legitimate routing
changes those methods suffer from many false positives.
Other proposals [23], [40], [49], [50] leverage active prob-
ing of networks together with passive monitoring to improve
the detection by assessing the impact of BGP routing changes
on the data plane. In order to study BGP hijacking spammers
we use the SPAMTRACER methodology we introduced in [47]
for collecting a comprehensive set of routing-level features
about spam networks. In [38] Roughan et al. advocates that
neither BGP nor traceroute measurements were designed to
infer the AS-level connectivity of the Internet and capture the
complex inter-AS relationships, hence all results inferred from
such data can only be as accurate as the data. However, we try
to balance this limitation by setting up our own data collection
process allowing us to collect the most appropriate data for
studying the routing-level behavior of spammers.
In 2006, Ramachandran et al. [35] introduced a new phe-
nomenon called “BGP spectrum agility”, where they claimed
to have observed, over a period of a few months, spam from a
set of large (i.e., /8) previously unannounced IP address blocks
hijacked for a very short period of time (i.e., less than one
day). Later, Hu et al. [23] and Duan et al. [20] conﬁrmed
these observations. However, we have recently shown in [46]
through a practical case study that correlating BGP abnormal
events with malicious network trafﬁc is insufﬁcient to conclu-
sively identify malicious BGP hijacks. Meanwhile, Schlamp
et al. [39] described a unique case where a couple of IP
address blocks were hijacked for months to perform malicious
activities, such as spamming.
