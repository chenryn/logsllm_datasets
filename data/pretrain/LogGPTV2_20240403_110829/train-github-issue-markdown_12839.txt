I am using BÉPO keyboard layout and I am not able to produce a _""_ in the
_atom-text-editor_. However it works fine in _setting menu_ and in the
_command prompt_ (ctrl+shift+p menu), and everything word fine if I switch to
a QWERTY or AZERTY layout.
_Repro case:_ With standard windows BÉPO driver, inside a text editor tab,
press AltGr+à (which is AtlGr+w in QWERTY, or to be precise 0xE011+0x1A from a
scan code point of view) and observe it does not produce a backslash.
It may be similar to #1625
