### 6.1 Applications and Future Research

#### 6.1.1 Use by Network Defenders
In Section 2, we discussed various scenarios in which a web page can become orphaned. Our implementation can assist network defenders by automating the discovery of outdated pages and other web resources. Instead of solely relying on the Internet Archive as a baseline, administrators can use internally stored sitemaps to evaluate pages that may not be included in web crawls. This approach can help identify and manage orphaned pages more effectively.

Additionally, our method can be extended to consider HTTP status codes other than 200 (OK). For example, status code 50x responses, which indicate that an application exists but may have lost access to its backend database, can also be valuable. By adjusting or omitting the filtering of file extensions, our technique can detect other orphaned resources, such as exposed documents.

#### 6.1.2 Use by Red Teams
Security professionals, such as penetration testers, can also benefit from our technique. Common tools like DirBuster or Gobuster can detect unintentionally accessible pages on a domain but rely on wordlists and enumeration. Our method complements these tools by providing a targeted search on a domain, identifying specific endpoints that may not be included in common wordlists. It also indicates pages that are no longer maintained, making them more likely to be vulnerable.

Similarly, Google Dorks are often used to identify orphaned or hidden sites. However, as shown in Section 4.8, our approach covers many pages not indexed by Google.

#### 6.1.3 Future Research
Our technique provides a baseline for studying the prevalence of orphaned web pages. Future research should refine our method to provide an upper bound of orphaned resources. Additionally, we did not investigate the impact of other resources, such as images, videos, PDF files, etc. These forgotten resources can potentially expose private data, especially when they are not meant to be accessible online.

While our technique is effective in detecting orphaned web pages, different approaches are worth exploring. For example, old blogs, forum posts, or Twitter tweets may contain orphaned URLs. Extracting these from social media platforms could be more robust against the limitations of web archives. Other historical information sources, such as Certificate Transparency (CT) logs and passive DNS datasets, offer opportunities to identify further types of orphaned resources, including forgotten servers, virtual machines, and services.

Finally, orphaned web pages are a form of misconfiguration. Surveying website administrators after they use our technique can provide insights into the prevalence and root causes of orphaned resources on a per-domain basis.

### 6.2 Ethics
Our work involves active measurements, and we follow established best practices as outlined in the Menlo Report [4, 13]. We took precautions to limit the operational impact on the web archive and measured sites by limiting and randomizing the number of requests. We also included contact information in the user agent of all web requests. Two parties opted out of our research, and we excluded them from our study.

Our Human Research-Subject Ethics Council (HREC) does not currently accept applications for ethical evaluations or waivers for research that does not directly involve human subjects. Therefore, for automated security scans, we carefully considered the trade-off between the utility of our research and the potential harm. As we only detected vulnerabilities and did not exploit them, we consider our approach ethical.

We disclosed all XSS and SQLi vulnerabilities found on orphaned pages or control group pages to the responsible administrators or respective CERTs. We were able to identify points of contact for 327 vulnerable pages, with some contacts covering multiple pages. Our email for contacting administrators is provided in Appendix C. We received one response from a national CERT, who did not share further information about remediation, and one response from an operator, who informed us that the affected site was indeed orphaned and would be taken offline. Another response from an operator with an affected site in the non-orphaned control group reported applying mitigations within a month of notification.

### 6.3 Limitations
Our study has several limitations that are important to note for accurately assessing the impact of our results. Specifically, we aim to establish a lower bound for orphaned web pages to prevent an alarmist response and alert fatigue. Our implementation provides a conservative approach to reduce the chance of over-matching, which inevitably means we may miss some potentially orphaned web pages. This suggests that orphaned web resources are likely more prevalent than our findings indicate.

The same applies to our methods for detecting copyrights, following redirects, and loading frames. Developing more ways to follow redirects and frames can provide additional depth to our page type analysis. Detecting more copyright statements, especially dynamic ones, can improve accuracy.

Finally, our study was conducted on a sample of 100,000 domains from the top 500,000 entries of the Tranco Top 1M. The prevalence of orphaned pages may differ for less prominent domains.

### 7 Related Work
Two areas of research are closely related: work on orphaned Internet resources (beyond the web) and use-after-free attacks on them, and work on maintenance and security misconfigurations.

#### 7.1 Orphaned Resources
Khalafut et al. studied the prevalence of orphaned DNS servers on the Internet [20], finding that 1.7% of records belong to orphaned DNS servers. Liu et al. [25] demonstrated how "Dangling DNS Records" can lead to domain hijacking. Borgolte et al. [6] investigated how DNS records pointing to cloud IP addresses can lead to domain takeover attacks due to IP address use-after-free attacks on cloud infrastructure. Alowaisheq et al. [1] showed that stale NS record types can be exploited via DNS hosting providers, potentially allowing domain hijacking for 628 domains of the Alexa's 1M.

Beyond DNS, Gruss et al. [16] showed that use-after-free attacks can also apply to email addresses. Aturban et al. examined the existence of orphaned annotations in Hypothes.is [3], finding that 27% of annotations are orphaned, and 3% could be reattached to archived versions of the target page using web archives. This highlights the potential of using web archives to obtain orphaned data, a concept we also leverage in this paper.

##### 7.1.1 Orphaned Resources vs. Use-After-Free
Related work on orphaned resources focuses on resources that are no longer allocated but still delegated from another service. Terminology for this situation ranges from stale, dangling, use-after-free, to orphaned, with the underlying concept being the same. In contrast, we focus on resources and services that have lost their delegation while continuing to exist. In our work, orphaned web pages cannot be reused or hijacked, but they become liabilities due to their vulnerabilities. Orphaned web pages remain under the original owner's control, unlike use-after-free resources, which can be taken over for exploitation.

#### 7.2 Update Behavior and Misconfigurations
Orphaned web pages may be a form of security misconfigurations, which have been extensively studied in the human factors in computer security community [21]. Dietrich et al. [12] studied the perspective of system administrators on security misconfigurations, uncovering issues such as a lack of documentation, unclear responsibilities, and unplanned changes. Li et al. [24] also suggest that orphaned pages might be a misconfiguration issue. While we confirmed the prevalence of orphaned pages, future work needs to confirm if their origin lies in misconfigurations.

Security misconfigurations are regularly studied through large-scale measurements. For example, Continella et al. [10] found that 14% of S3 storage buckets are public, Ferrari et al. [14] studied misconfigured NoSQL services, and Springall et al. [30] found that 8% of 13.8M FTP servers allow anonymous access. Bijmans et al. [5] found over 1M unmaintained MikroTik routers vulnerable to embedding cryptomining code in user traffic. DNS(SEC) misconfigurations have also been shown to cause unavailability and security issues [11, 17, 34].

These studies underscore how misconfigurations are a frequent cause of security issues and occur in the wild.

### 8 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce the concept of orphaned web pages as a security risk and develop a novel methodology to detect them. Using a sample of 100,000 websites from the top 500,000 ranked sites in the Tranco Top 1M, we found 1,953 pages that are likely orphaned, spread across 907 domains, with some of these pages being as old as 20 years.

We find that orphaned pages are significantly (ùëù < 0.01 using ùúí¬≤) more likely to be vulnerable to XSS (19.3%) and SQLi (10.8%) vulnerabilities than maintained pages (2.0% for XSS and 2.7%). Furthermore, maintained pages on sites that host orphans are also more likely to contain XSS (5.9%) and SQLi (9.5%) vulnerabilities than other maintained pages, leading to a clear hierarchy: Orphaned pages are the most vulnerable, followed by maintained pages on websites with some orphans, and least vulnerable are other maintained pages.
