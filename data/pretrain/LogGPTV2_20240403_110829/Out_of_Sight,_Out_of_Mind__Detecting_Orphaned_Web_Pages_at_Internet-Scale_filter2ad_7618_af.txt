6.1 Applications and Future Research
Our methodology holds practical applications for network defense
and vulnerability assessments, and potential for future research.
6.1.1 Use by Network Defenders In Section 2, we have shown var-
ious scenarios in which a web page can become orphaned. Here,
our implementation can assist defenders by automating discovery
for outdated page and web resources in general. Instead of (solely)
relying on the Internet Archive as a baseline, administrators can
also make use of internally stored sitemaps of the website, allow-
ing pages outside of web crawls to be evaluated as well.
Additionally, instead of looking at orphaned pages with an HTTP
OK (200) status code, other responses might be interesting, such
as status code 50x responses indicating applications that still exist,
but, for example, lost access to their backend database. The filter-
ing of file extensions can also be adjusted, or omitted, allowing the
detection of other orphaned resources like (exposed) documents.
6.1.2 Use by Red Teams Security professionals, like pentesters,
can also benefit from using our technique. Common tools like Dir-
Buster or Gobuster can detect (unintentionally) accessible pages
on a domain, but rely on the use of wordlists and enumeration.
Our technique is complementary: it provides a targeted-search on
a domain. It identifies specific end points potentially not included
in common word-lists and provides an indication of pages that are
not maintained anymore, meaning they are likely more vulnerable.
Similarly, Google Dorks [33] are commonly used for identifying or-
phaned or hidden sites. However, as we have shown in Section 4.8,
our approach largely covers pages not indexed by Google.
Future Research Our technique provides the first baseline
6.1.3
for studying the prevalence of orphaned web-pages on the web.
Further research should refine our technique to also provide an
upper bound of orphaned resources. Similarly, we do not inves-
tigate the impact of other resources, such as images, videos, PDF
files, etc. Such (forgotten) resources can potentially expose private
data, especially when encountering PDF or Excel (XLS) files that
are not meant to be accessible online (anymore).
While our technique for detecting orphaned web page is effec-
tive, we believe different approaches in detecting these pages are
worthy of exploring. For example, old blogs, forum posts, or Twit-
ter tweets, can potentially contain orphaned URLs. Extracting those
from social media platforms could be more robust against the lim-
itations (crawl heuristics and depth) of web archives. In addition,
other historic information sources may be valuable in identifying
orphaned non-web resources, that is, forgotten servers, virtual ma-
chines, and services. Specifically, we believe that Certificate Trans-
parency (CT) logs and passive DNS data sets offer an opportunity
to identify further types of orphaned resources.
Finally, orphaned web pages are a form of misconfigurations
(see Section 7). Surveying website administrators after they used
our technique can also yield interesting insights into the preva-
lence (on a per-domain basis) and root-causes of orphaned resources.
6.2 Ethics
Our work uses active measurements. As such, we are following es-
tablished best practices as outlined in the Menlo report [4, 13]. We
took precautions to limit the operational impact of our work on the
web archive in coordination with the operators, and on the mea-
sured sites by limiting and randomizing the number of requests
a site receives (see Section 3.2.3). We also included contact infor-
mation in the user agent of all web requests that we made. Two
parties opted-out of our research, and we excluded them from it.
Our HREC (Human Research-Subject Ethics Council) does cur-
rently not accept applications for ethical evaluations or waivers for
research that does not directly involve human subjects. Hence, for
the automated security scans we carefully considered the trade-off
between the utility of our research vs. the potential harm we cause.
As we made sure to only detect vulnerabilities and did not exploit
them, we consider our approach ethical.
We disclosed all XSS and SQLi vulnerabilities we found on or-
phan pages or pages in our control groups to the responsible ad-
ministrators, or to the respective CERT when no direct contact in-
formation was available. We were able to identify points of contact
for 327 vulnerable pages, with some contacts covering multiple
pages (i.e. from the same website). Our email for contacting the
respective administrators can be found in Appendix C. We received
one response from a national CERT, who did not share further in-
formation about how they remediated the vulnerabilities, and one
response from an operator, who informed us that the affected site
was indeed orphaned, and would be taken offline. Furthermore,
there was one response from an operator with an affected site in
the non-orphaned control group, who reported to apply mitiga-
tions within a month from notification.
6.3 Limitations
Our study has several limitations which are important to note for
correctly assess the impact of our results. Specifically, we are try-
ing to establish a lower bound for orphaned web-pages. We be-
lieve it is important to state a lower bound to prevent an alarmist
response and alert fatigue. Our implementation provides an acces-
sible aid for users to assess the severity of this problem on their do-
main, while simultaneously inviting further research. This means
that all heuristics employed in our study (Dynamic URL Detec-
tion heuristic and fingerprint comparison) are configured conser-
vatively to reduce the chance of over-matching. However, it also
inevitably causes us to miss potentially orphaned web pages, mean-
ing orphaned web resources are like more prevalent.
The same holds for our methods for detecting copyrights, fol-
lowing redirects, and loading frames. Developing more ways of
following redirects and frames can provide additional depth to our
page type analysis. Similarly, detecting more copyright statements
(for example, different copyright standards, or in-code construc-
tion) can improve accuracy. Especially the detection of dynamic
copyright statements can contribute to expanding our results.

from the top 500,000 entries of the Tranco Top 1M. The prevalence
of orphaned pages may differ for less prominent domains.
7 Related Work
Two areas of research are closely related: work on orphaned Inter-
net resources (beyond the web) and use-after-free attacks on them,
and work on maintenance and security misconfigurations.
7.1 Orphaned Resources
Khalafut et al. studied the prevalence of orphaned DNS servers on
the Internet [20], with orphaned DNS servers being those with a
DNS record pointing to them, but with no delegation from a parent
zone. Overall, 1.7% of records belong to orphaned DNS servers.
Liu et al. [25] demonstrate how through “Dangling DNS Records”
domains can be hijacked for malicious purposes. Borgolte et al. [6]
investigated how DNS records pointing to cloud IP addresses can
lead to domain takeover attacks because IP address use-after-free
attacks on cloud infrastructure and they show that these attacks
are practical and cost effective to execute on public clouds. Stale
NS record types have been studied by Alowaisheq et al. [1], who
show how they can be exploited via DNS hosting providers, possi-
bly allowing domain hijacking for 628 domains of the Alexa’s 1M.
Beyond DNS, Gruss et al. [16] show that use-after-free attacks can
also apply to email addresses.
Related to the web, Aturban et al. examine the existence of or-
phaned annotations in Hypothes.is, a tool to annotate websites [3].
An annotation is orphaned when it can no longer be attached to
its target page, because the page does not exist anymore, or be-
cause the annotated content on the web page has been removed.
They found that 27% of annotations are orphaned, and 3% could
be reattached to archived versions of the target page by making use
of web archives. This indicates the potential of using web archives
to obtain orphaned data; a concept we also leverage in this paper.
7.1.1 Orphaned Resources vs. Use-After-Free Related work on or-
phaned resources focuses on resources that are no longer allocated
themselves, but still are delegated from another service. Terminol-
ogy for this situation ranges from stale, dangling, use-after-free, to
orphaned, with the underlying concept being the same. In contrast
to these broader concepts, we focus on resources and services that
lost their delegation, while continuing to exist, that is, the inverse
kind of orphaned resources. In our work, the orphaned resource
(web pages) cannot be re-used or hijacked when an attacker takes
over an orphaned delegation. Instead, the resource itself becomes
the liability, for example, due to its vulnerabilities. Orphaned web
pages are, however, still under the original owner’s control. Other
terms, such as use-after-free, signify that control has been relin-
quished and the resource can be taken over for exploitation.
7.2 Update Behavior and Misconfigurations
Orphaned web pages may be a form of security misconfigurations,
which have been extensively studied in the human factors in com-
puter security community [21]. Dietrich et al. studied the perspec-
tive of system administrators on security misconfigurations [12].
We see parallels between the issues they uncovered and poten-
tial causes for orphaned pages, such as a lack of documentation
(non-updated sitemaps), lack of responsibility (who controls which
page), and unclear processes and procedures (unplanned changes
of pages). The work of Li et al. also suggests that orphaned pages
might be an issue of misconfiguration [24]. Albeit we confirmed
the prevalence of orphaned pages, future work needs to confirm if
its origin is in misconfigurations.
Security misconfigurations are regularly studied with at-scale
measurements. For example, Continella et al. measured miscon-
figurations around Amazon S3 cloud storage services [10], find-
ing 14% S3 storage buckets being public. Ferrari et al. similarly
studied misconfigured NoSQL services [14]. Earlier, Springall et
al. measured misconfigured FTP servers, with 8% of 13.8M FTP
servers allowing for anonymous access [30]. A study by Bijmans
et al. finds over 1M unmaintained MikroTik routers vulnerable to
embedding cryptomining code in user traffic [5]. Also DNS(SEC)
misconfigurations have been shown to cause unavailability and se-
curity issues [11, 17, 34].
These studies underline how misconfigurations are still a fre-
quent cause for security issues, and are occurring in the wild.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce the concept of orphaned web pages as a
security risk and develop a novel methodology to detect them. Us-
ing a sample of 100,000 websites, stemming from the 500,00 highest
ranked sites in the Tranco Top 1M, we found 1,953 pages that are
likely orphaned, spread across 907 domains, with some of these
pages being as old as 20 years.
We find that orphaned pages are significantly (𝑝 < 0.01 using
𝜒 2) more likely to be vulnerable to XSS (19.3%) and SQLi (10.8%)
vulnerabilities than maintained pages (2.0% for XSS and 2.7%). Fur-
thermore, maintained pages on sites that host orphans are also
more likely to contain XSS (5.9%) and SQLi (9.5%) than maintained
pages, leading to a clear hierarchy: Orphaned pages are the most
vulnerable, followed by maintained pages on websites with some
orphans, and least vulnerable are other maintained pages.
