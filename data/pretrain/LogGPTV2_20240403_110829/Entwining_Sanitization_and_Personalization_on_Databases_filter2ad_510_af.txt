APPENDIX: TARDOS CODES
The main notions of Tardos codes are introduced hereafter. How-
ever, simplifications have been made in order to ease the presenta-
tion.

Now, let p∗ be defined as p∗ = 1−p = cos2(q), in which q is defined
as before. Its probability density function fp∗ (x ) is equal to fp (x ).
Thus, E[pc] = E[(1 − p)c].
The Tardos codes [27] of length l can be defined as follows. Let
p1,· · · , pl be l independent random variables identically distributed
following p.The set of n codes C = {C1,· · · , Cn} is defined as:
Pr[Ci, j = 1] = pj , for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ l .
1 ≤ j ≤ l. Thus, E[Ci|p1,· · · , pl ] =(cid:80)

of a code Ci is given by the sum of l trials with probabilities pj,

Consider c colluders forging a counterfeit code. By the mark-
ing assumption, their common invariant bits would be present in
any counterfeit code. Assume for simplicity that the remaining
bits are selected with probability 1
2. Nonetheless, the results are
independent of the colluders’ strategy for these mutant bits [9].
Fact 2: The number of invariant bits. This number I is the

The accusation score Si of an innocent is the sum of the inde-

and д10 (p) = −(cid:112)

Since both values are 0, the expectation E[Si] = 0. It is straightfor-

On the other hand, the accusation score Sk of a colluder is the
sum of the independent scores Sk, j, for 1 ≤ j ≤ l, defined as follows.

Fact 4: Flipping invariant bits. If the colluders can randomly
flip some of their invariant bits, they may expect to decrease the
probability that one of them is accused. Note that this technique
does not impact the expectation of the scores of the innocents. On
one hand, flipping a common invariant 1-bit reduces the scores of
(1 − p)/p. Similarly, flipping a 0-bit reduces the
the colluders by 2(cid:112)
scores by 2(cid:112)
p/(1 − p).
A naïve argument can be used to estimate the fraction f of
invariant bits to flip to reduce the expectation of the scores of the
colluders below the accusation threshold. If the code length l =
ϵ and the accusation threshold Z = cZ c ln 1
cl c2 ln 1
ϵ , the expectation
of the colluder scores E[Sk] can be rewritten as 2

only the invariant bits contribute to the score. Thus, an invariant
bit adds to the score 1I 2
Z. By flipping a fraction f of these

bits, the expectation of the colluders scores would be reduced by
