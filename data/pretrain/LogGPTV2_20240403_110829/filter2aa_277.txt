Introduction
Malware: missions and tactics
Malware: missions and tactics
• First questions that we need to answer analyzing malware: WHAT?
• What is the main purpose (mission) of tha malware?
• What is the malware family?
• Other questions that follow: HOW?
• How are the goals implemented?
• Are the used techniques novel/similar to known implementations?
• Possible actor: WHO?
• Cybercrime? Nation-State? Level of sophistication?
Malware: missions
• Most common malware missions:
• Extortion (ransomware)
• Financial fraud and stealing of credentials (i.e. Banking trojans, card number stealers)
• Long-run espionage operations (RATs, spyware)
• Short run-espionage operations (stealing documents)
• Botnets for other attacks (i.e. DDoS bots, spamming bots, click-fraud, loading of secondary 
malware)
• Illegitimate usage of resources (i.e. proxy botnets, cryptocurrency miners)
• Sometimes multiple goals can be implemented in one executable
Malware: families
• Trending malware families
• https://any.run/malware-trends/

malware-report/
Malware: tactics
• MITRE database (https://attack.mitre.org/tactics) –set of common tactics used by 
malware
• Depending on malware family, the authors may be interested in achieving different goals, 
i.e. 
• Persistence
• Defense Evasion
• Stealing Credentials
• Exfiltration
• Lateral Movements
• Manipulation/Destruction
