### Module 2: Typical Goals of Malware and Their Implementations

#### Introduction
- **Malware: Missions and Tactics**
  - When analyzing malware, the first questions to address are:
    - **WHAT?** What is the primary mission or purpose of the malware?
    - **HOW?** How are these goals implemented? Are the techniques novel or similar to known implementations?
    - **WHO?** Who is the possible actor behind the malware? Is it a cybercriminal, a nation-state, or another entity? What is the level of sophistication?

#### Malware Missions
- **Common Malware Missions:**
  - **Extortion (Ransomware):** Encrypts user data and demands a ransom for decryption.
  - **Financial Fraud and Credential Theft:** Steals financial information and credentials, often through banking trojans or card number stealers.
  - **Long-Run Espionage Operations:** Uses Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and spyware to gather sensitive information over an extended period.
  - **Short-Run Espionage Operations:** Targets specific documents or data for immediate exfiltration.
  - **Botnets for Other Attacks:** Deploys botnets for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, spamming, click-fraud, or loading secondary malware.
  - **Illegitimate Usage of Resources:** Utilizes proxy botnets and cryptocurrency miners to exploit system resources for unauthorized purposes.
  - **Multiple Goals in One Executable:** Some malware can have multiple missions within a single executable.

#### Malware Tactics
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework:**
  - The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a comprehensive set of common tactics used by malware. You can find more details at: [MITRE ATT&CK Tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics)
  - Depending on the malware family, the authors may focus on different tactics, such as:
    - **Persistence:** Ensuring the malware remains active even after system reboots.
    - **Defense Evasion:** Avoiding detection by security software.
    - **Credential Stealing:** Extracting usernames, passwords, and other authentication information.
    - **Exfiltration:** Transferring stolen data from the victim's system to the attacker's server.
    - **Lateral Movement:** Spreading the malware to other systems within the network.
    - **Manipulation/Destruction:** Altering or deleting data to cause harm or cover tracks.

By understanding the typical goals, families, and tactics of malware, analysts can better detect, mitigate, and respond to threats.
