Hello,

I would like to share a piece of code and a suggestion for improvement:

```typescript
let value: any;

if (value instanceof MyClass) {
    // Since `value` is of type `any`, we need to typecast it to get IntelliSense working:
    (value as MyClass).prop = true;
}
```

It would be great if this feature could be supported natively, as it would enhance the developer experience by providing better type safety and autocompletion.

Thank you in advance, and I hope this suggestion can help others as well.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
