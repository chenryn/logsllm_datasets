User: I have an executable that run time should take configuration parameters from a script file. This way I dont need to re-compile the code for every configuration change. Right now I have all the configuration values in a .h file. Everytime I change it i need to re-compile. 
The platform is C, gcc under Linux.
What is the best solution for this problem? I looked up on google and so XML, phthon and Lua bindings for C. Is using a separate scripting language the best approach?  If so, which one would you recommend for my need?
Addendum:
What if I would like to mirror data structures in script files? If I have an array of structures for example, if there an easy way to store and load it?
Thanks
Assistant: How much configuration do you need that it needs to be a "script file"? 
I just keep a little chunk of code handy that's a ini format parser.
