Question: "Consider the principles of privilege separation as applied in the OKWS web server system. Evaluate the roles of different components and their associated security implications. Which of the following statements are correct concerning the security design and potential vulnerabilities in the OKWS system?"
 "A": "The dbproxy service is designed to prevent SQL injection attacks by accepting RPCs instead of SQL queries directly from services."
 "B": "A buffer overflow vulnerability in the profile editor service could potentially expose user passwords because it has access to the entire database."
 "C": "The design of OKWS allows the oklogd service to modify or delete log entries, which could be exploited by an attacker to cover their tracks."
 "D": "Per-user isolation in OKWS is deemed too expensive because the overhead of processing an HTTP request is much lower than that of starting or maintaining a separate process for each user."
