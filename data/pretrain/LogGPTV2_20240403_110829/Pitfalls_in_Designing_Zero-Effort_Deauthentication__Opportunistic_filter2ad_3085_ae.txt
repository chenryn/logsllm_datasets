VIII. RELATED WORK
User authentication is commonly based on three different
factors: something you know, something you have, and some-
thing you are. Many traditional authentication methods rely on
the ﬁrst two. Passwords still remain very popular, and they are
often complemented with some sort of physical tokens, such
as RSA SecurID [14]. The downside is the need to deploy and
carry these tokens.
A large body of research has considered biometric authenti-
cation. Examples include the use of ﬁngerprint [11], hand [21],
iris [10], facial [4] or blood vessel information [30]. Biometric
authentication is attractive because they reduce the user burden
by removing the need to memorize secrets or having to carry
external tokens. However, these schemes can still be vulnerable
to spooﬁng, and introduce new issues such as the problem
of revocation and raise privacy concerns. Also,
traditional
biometric authentication is not transparent to the user.
The desire to minimize the user burden of authentication
has led to a quest for transparent and continuous authen-
tication schemes that can be “zero-effort.” One approach
uses proximity-based authentication where the presence of
a personal device is used to authenticate the user. Such
schemes can be based on RFID, NFC, Bluetooth or even
WiFi signal strength. The appeal
is the possibility to use
existing devices seamlessly, but unfortunately the drawbacks
include limited accuracy and vulnerability to spooﬁng and
replay attacks [18] [19] [15].
Behavioral biometrics consider behavior intrinsic to spe-
ciﬁc individuals. A common example is gait, identiﬁed from
video or acceleration information. Gafurov et al. [16] perform
authentication based on a user’s gait, which is characterized
by recorded accelerations from a hip-worn device. The same
author also considers [17] spooﬁng attacks against gait-based
authentication. A subset of these behavioral biometrics are
keystroke and typing based authentication schemes. In an early
work, Joyce et al. [20] and Monrose et al. [25] [24] identify
users based on their typing rhythm. They consider the inter-
key latencies and are able to effectively authenticate users.
More recently, Ahmed et al. consider mouse dynamics for
authentication [1].
[13] distinguishes users based on how
they input touch patterns into a smartphone. However, Tey
et al. [27] show how through training, attackers can learn to
defeat keystroke biometrics based authentication.
Combining multiple types of transparent authentication
schemes, such as the proposal by Riva et al. [26], can improve
the overall performance. But the design of such systems is
complex and remains an open research problem.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
ZEBRA is an interesting and useful approach as a zero-
effort deauthentication system. We identiﬁed a subtle design
ﬂaw in this approach, which is (1) easier for the human
operators to perform and (2) more robust, compared to the
na¨ıve attacks studied by the authors of the ZEBRA scheme
[23]. We demonstrated that a malicious adversary who adopts
an opportunistic strategy can defeat ZEBRA. This is at odds
with the positive results reported in [23] but is explained
by their attackers using a na¨ıve strategy of trying to mimic
all interactions of a victim. Our attack is done in a typical
usage scenario. While physical mitigations, such as visual
barriers, might make our speciﬁc attack less successful, the
underlying vulnerability still stands. Although susceptible to
opportunistic adversaries, ZEBRA still performs well against
accidental misuse by innocent adversaries, which is possibly
the most likely threat in scenarios that ZEBRA was originally
designed for. However, systems are often used in contexts
that the designers did not originally envisage. Therefore, we
believe that recognizing the limits of the original design of
ZEBRA against malicious adversaries is the ﬁrst step towards
strengthening its resistance so that it can be used in scenarios
where malicious adversaries pose a signiﬁcant
threat. The
approaches we identiﬁed in Section VI can help secure ZEBRA
without losing its desirable properties. We are developing these
approaches further in our current work. More generally, we
showed that subtle design assumptions based on premature
usability and privacy considerations can adversely impact
security of a system. We also highlight the importance of
ensuring that adversary models used in analyzing the security
of systems are realistic and do not underestimate attacker
capabilities.
