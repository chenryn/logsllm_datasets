sensor  networks.  For  example,  we  assume  nodes  are

energy  consumption,  which,  although  being  an  important 
issue  in  wireless  ad  hoc  networks  in  general,  is  vital  in 
sensor  networks.  Sensor  nodes  are  typically  battery-
powered and, because replacing or recharging batteries is 
often  very  difficult  or 
impossible,  reducing  energy 
consumption is the only way to extend network lifetime. 
In many applications of wireless ad hoc networks, the 
nodes  are  mobile.  This  complicates  analysis  of  network 
characteristics because the network topology is constantly 
changing  in  this  situation.  In  this  work,  we  consider 
networks  both  with  and  without  mobility.  We  present 
analytical results that apply to networks without mobility

Abstract 
We consider the following problem for wireless ad hoc 
networks: assume n nodes, each capable of communicating 
with  nodes  within  a  radius  of  r,  are  distributed  in  a  d-
dimensional  region  of  side  l;  how  large  must  the  tran-
smitting range r be to ensure that the resulting network is 
connected?  We  also  consider  the  mobile  version  of  the 
problem,  in  which  nodes  are  allowed  to  move  during  a 
time interval and the value of r ensuring connectedness for 
a given fraction of the interval must be determined. For the 
stationary  case,  we  give  tight  bounds  on  the  relative 
magnitude  of  r,  n  and  l  yielding  a connected graph  with 
high  probability  in  1-dimensional  networks,  thus  solving 
an open problem. The mobile version of the problem when 
d=2  is  investigated  through  extensive  simulations, which 
give insight on how mobility affect connectivity and reveal 
a  useful trade-off between  communication capability and 
energy consumption.

Introduction 
Wireless ad hoc networks are networks where multiple 
nodes,  each  possessing  a  wireless  transceiver,  form  a 
network  amongst 
themselves  via  peer-to-peer  com-
munication. An  ad hoc  network can  be  used to exchange 
information  between  the  nodes  and  to  allow  nodes  to 
communicate with remote sites that they otherwise would 
not have the capability to reach. Wireless ad hoc networks 
are sometimes referred to as wireless multi-hop networks 
because,  as  opposed  to  wireless  LAN  environments, 
messages typically require multiple hops before reaching a 
gateway into the wired network infrastructure.   
Sensor networks [8] are a particular class of wireless ad 
hoc  networks  in  which  there  are  many  nodes,  each 
containing 
a  wireless 
transceiver, and a simple processor. Potential applications 
of  sensor  networks  abound,  e.g.  monitoring  of  ocean 
application-specific 
sensors,

conditions,  to  a  higher  power)  of  the  transmitting  range.  
Our evaluation of required transmitting range is also useful 
in directing various ‘topology control’ protocols, which try 
to  dynamically  adjust  transmitting  ranges  in  order  to 
minimize  energy  consumption  at  run  time  [6,9,10].  The 
question  of  how  many  nodes  are  necessary  for  a  given 
transmitting  range  is  very  important  for  planning  and 
design of wireless ad hoc networks when devices employ a 
fixed transceiver technology. 
Our primary analytical result in this paper shows that a 
1-dimensional network with nodes placed over a region of 
length  l  is  connected  if  and  only  if  the  product  of  the 
number of nodes and the transmitting range is on the order 
of  at  least  l  log  l.  This  closes  a  gap  between  lower  and 
upper bounds on this product  that were established in an 
earlier paper [11]. Note that the 1-dimensional version of 
the  problem  does  have  important  practical  applications.  
The most notable such application is to cars on a freeway, 
which approximates a  1-dimensional region. An oft-cited 
potential  use  of  mobile  ad  hoc  networks  is  to  have 
transmitters  placed  in  cars  that  can  transmit  information 
about  congestion  or  accidents  to  cars  further  back.  By 
repeated relaying of such information, drivers far from the 
problem  site  can  learn  of  the  congestion  and  select  an 
alternate  route  without  waiting  for  a  central  notification 
system to learn of the event and post warning notices. 
included  a  parameter 
We also evaluate 2-dimensional networks with mobility 
through extensive simulations. We compare two different 
mobility  models,  the  random  waypoint  model,  which 
models intentional movement, and the drunkard model, in 
which movement is random. In both mobility models, we 
have 
that  accounts  for  those 
situations in which some nodes are not able to move. For 
example,  this  could  be  the  case  when  sensors  are  spread 
from  a  moving  vehicle,  and  some  of  them  remain 
entangled,  say,  in  a  bush  or  tree.  This  can  also  model  a 
situation where two types of nodes are used, one type that 
is stationary and another type that is mobile. 
The goal of our simulations is to study the relationship 
between  the  value  of  the  transmitting  range  ensuring 
connected graphs in the stationary case and the values of 
the  transmitting  range  ensuring  connected  graphs  during 
some  fraction  of  the  operational  time.  In  this  paper,  we 
focus  on  the  transmitting  ranges  needed  to  ensure 
connectedness  during  100%,  90%  and  10%  of  the 
simulation time. These values are chosen as indicative of 
three  different  dependability  scenarios  that  the  ad  hoc 
network  must  satisfy.  We  also  consider  the  value  of  the 
transmitting  range  ensuring  that  the  average  size  of  the 
largest connected component is a given fraction of the total 
number  of  nodes  in  the  network.  The  rationale  for  this 
investigation  is  that  the  network  designer  could  be 
interested  in  maintaining  only  a  certain  fraction  of  the 
nodes connected, if this would result in significant energy 
savings.  Further,  considering that in many scenarios (e.g. 
wireless sensor networks) the cost of a node is very low, it 
could also be the case that dispersing twice as many nodes 
as needed and setting the transmitting ranges in such a way 
that  half of the nodes remain connected is a feasible and 
cost-effective solution. 
The  results  of  our  simulations  have  shown 
the 
somewhat  surprising  fact  that,  from  a  strictly  statistical 
view  of  connectedness  and  connected  component  size, 
there  are  no  major  differences  between  the  two  mobility 
models. We also demonstrate that quite large reductions in 
transmitting  range  can  be  achieved  if  brief  periods  of 
disconnection are allowed and/or the network is allowed to 
operate with only a significant fraction of the nodes being 
connected. These results illustrate an energy vs. quality of 
communication  trade-off  that  can  be  achieved  in  ad  hoc 
networks, whereby the extent of communication capability 
can  be  somewhat  reduced  without  great  impact  on  the 
application  and  with  the  benefit  of  significantly  reduced 
energy  consumption.  A  final  interesting  result  of  our 
simulations shows that if about ½ or fewer of the nodes are 
mobile,  then  the  network  appears  equivalent,  in  terms  of 
statistical connectedness, to one without mobility. 
The  properties  we  study  in  this  paper  are  akin  to  a 
simple form of availability for wireless  ad hoc networks.  
Assuming that a network is “up” if all nodes are connected 
and  “down”  otherwise,  then  the  percentage  of  time  it  is 
connected is an estimate of network availability.  Since, in 
some  applications,  the  network  might  be  functional  if  at 
least a given fraction of nodes are connected, we also study 
the  size  of  the  largest  connected  component  when  the 
network  is  disconnected.    For  these  applications,  the 
percentage of time for which a sufficiently large number of 
nodes are connected is an availability estimate.

A  d-dimensional  mobile  wireless  ad  hoc  network  is 
represented  by  a  pair  Md=(N,P),  where  N  is  the  set  of 
nodes, with |N|=n, and P: N×T→[0,l]d, for some l>0, is the 
placement  function.  The  placement  function  assigns  to 
every  element  of  N  and  to  any  time  t∈T  a  set  of

coordinates 
representing  the  node’s  physical  position  at  time  t.  The 
choice  of  limiting  the  admissible  physical  placement  of 
nodes  to  a  bounded  region  of  Rd  of  the  form  [0,l]d,  for 
some  l>0,  is  realistic  and  will  ease  the  probabilistic 
analysis of Section 3. If the physical node placement does 
not  vary  with  time,  the  network  is  said  to  be  stationary, 
and function P can be redefined simply as P: N →[0,l]d.

In  this  paper,  we  assume  that  all  the  nodes  in  the 
network  have  the  same  transmitting  range  r.  With  this 
assumption,  the  communication  graph  of  Md  induced  at 
time t, denoted GM(t), is defined as GM(t)=(N,E(t)), where 
the edge (u,v)∈E(t) if and only if v is at distance at most r 
from  u  at  time  t.  If    (u,v)∈E(t),  node  v  is  said  to  be  a

neighbor of u at time t. GM(t) corresponds to a point graph 
as defined in [12].  
In the next section, we consider probabilistic solutions 
to the following problem for stationary ad hoc networks:  
MINIMUM TRANSMITTING RANGE (MTR):  
Suppose n nodes are placed in [0,l]d; what is the minimum 
value of r such that the resulting communication graph is 
connected?  
the  minimum  number  of  nodes 
Given  the  number  of  nodes,  minimizing  r  while 
maintaining a connected network is of primary importance 
if energy consumption is to be reduced. In fact, the energy 
consumed  by  a  node  for  communication  is  directly 
dependent on its transmitting range.  Further, a small value 
of r reduces the interferences between node transmissions, 
thus increasing the network capacity [5]. Observe that we 
could  just  as  easily  have  stated  the  problem  as  one  of 
finding 
to  ensure 
connectedness  given  a  fixed  transmitting  range.  This 
formulation  is  of  primary  importance  in  many  dimen-
sioning problems arising in the design of wireless ad hoc 
networks. For example, solving this problem would answer 
the following fundamental question to the system designer: 
for a given transmitter technology, how many nodes must 
be distributed over a given region to ensure connectedness 
with  high  probability?  In  fact,  our  solutions  typically 
specify  requirements  on  the  product  of  n  and  rd  that 
ensures connectedness. These solutions can, therefore, be 
used  to  solve  either  MTR,  as  specified  above,  or  the 
alternate  formulation  where  the  number  of  nodes  is  the 
primary concern.   
It should be observed that the solution to MTR depends 
on  the  information  we  have  about  the  physical  node 
placement. If the node placement is known in advance, the 
minimum value of r ensuring connectedness can be easily 
determined.  Unfortunately,  in  many  realistic  scenarios  of 
ad hoc networks the node placement cannot be known in 
advance,  for  example  because  nodes  are  spread  from  a 
moving  vehicle  (airplane,  ship  or  spacecraft).  If  nodes’ 
positions are not known, the minimum value of r ensuring 
connectedness  in  all  possible  cases  is  r≈
,  which 
accounts  for  the  fact  that nodes could  be  concentrated at 
opposite  corners  of  the  placement  region.  However,  this 
scenario  appears  to  be  very  unlikely  in  most  realistic 
situations. For this reason MTR has been studied in [1,11] 
under 
that  nodes  are  distributed 
independently  and  uniformly  at  random  in  the placement 
region.  
the  assumption 
Observe  that  connectivity  problems  with  formulations 
similar to MTR have also been studied in [4,7]. However, 
in these papers the deployment area is a fixed region (the 
unit disk in [4], or [0,1]2 in [7]), and the number of nodes 
is increased to infinity. Thus, the asymptotic investigation 
is  for  networks  with  increasing  node  density,  and  is 
dl
expected  to  be  accurate  in  dense  networks.  On  the 
contrary, the problem formulation used in this paper does 
not  force  the  node  density  to  asymptotically  increase  to 
infinity.  
In the next section, we will improve the results of [1,11] 
for the case d=1 by means of a more accurate analysis of 
the  conditions  leading  to  disconnected  communication 
graphs.  The  analysis  will  use  some  results  of  the 
occupancy theory [3], which are presented next. 
 The  occupancy  problem  can  be  described  as  follows: 
assume  we  have  C  cells,  and  n  balls  to  be  thrown 
independently in the cells. The allocation of balls into cells 
can  be  characterized  by  means  of  random  variables 
describing  some  property  of  the  cells.  The  occupancy 
theory is aimed at determining the probability distribution 
of such variables as n and C grow to infinity (i.e., the limit 
distribution).  The  most  studied  random  variable  is  the 
number of empty cells after all the balls have been thrown, 
which will be denoted µ(n,C) in the following. Under the 
assumption  that  the  probability  for  any  particular  ball  to 
fall  into  the  i-th  cell  is  1/C  for  i=1,...,C  (uniform 
allocation), the following results have been proved1:
