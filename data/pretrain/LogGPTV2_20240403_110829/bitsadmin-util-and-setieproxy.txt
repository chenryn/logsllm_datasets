bitsadmin util and setieproxy
Set the proxy settings to use when transferring files using a service account. You must run this command from an elevated command prompt for it to complete successfully.

This command isn't supported by BITS 1.5 and earlier.
Syntax
bitsadmin /util /setieproxy   [/conn ]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
account
Specifies the service account whose proxy settings you want to define. Possible values include:LOCALSYSTEM   NETWORKSERVICELOCALSERVICE.
usage
Specifies the form of proxy detection to use. Possible values include:NO_PROXY. Don't use a proxy server.AUTODETECT. Automatically detect the proxy settings.MANUAL_PROXY. Use a specified proxy list and bypass list. You must specify your lists immediately after the usage tag. For example, MANUAL_PROXY proxy1,proxy2 NULL.Proxy list. A comma-delimited list of proxy servers to use.Bypass list. A space-delimited list of host names or IP addresses, or both, for which transfers are not to be routed through a proxy. This can be  to refer to all servers on the same LAN. Values of NULL or  may be used for an empty proxy bypass list.AUTOSCRIPT. Same as AUTODETECT, except it also runs a script. You must specify the script URL immediately after the usage tag. For example, AUTOSCRIPT http://server/proxy.js.RESET. Same as NO_PROXY, except it removes the manual proxy URLs (if specified) and any URLs discovered using automatic detection.
connectionname
Optional. Used with the /conn parameter to specify which modem connection to use. If you don't specify the /conn parameter, BITS uses the LAN connection.
MANUAL_PROXY proxy1,proxy2 NULL
AUTOSCRIPT http://server/proxy.js
Remarks
Each successive call using this switch replaces the previously specified usage, but not the parameters of the previously defined usage. For example, if you specify NO_PROXY, AUTODETECT, and MANUAL_PROXY on separate calls, BITS uses the last supplied usage, but keeps the parameters from the previously defined usage.
Examples
To set the proxy usage for the LOCALSYSTEM account:
bitsadmin /util /setieproxy localsystem AUTODETECT
bitsadmin /util /setieproxy localsystem MANUAL_PROXY proxy1,proxy2,proxy3 NULL
bitsadmin /util /setieproxy localsystem MANUAL_PROXY proxy1:80
