When a request is made through AJAX Symfony correctly knows that the request
is an XMLHttpRequest. This can be retrieved from the isXmlHttpRequest method
of the Request class. However, this doesn't set the _format parameter in the
request to the correct value. For example, making an AJAX request with
JQuery.ajax sends the content-type **application/json** which isn't then used
to set the response format. This means that for example when an exception is
thrown and returned as response it will always be in HTML format except when a
route has the _format parameter explicitly set. I don't find anything about
the fact that this behaviour is intended. I resolved by setting manually that
parameter if I detect that the request is an XMLHttpRequest. However, I really
think that this is a bug because Symfony should always use the content-type if
detected to generate the appropriate response
