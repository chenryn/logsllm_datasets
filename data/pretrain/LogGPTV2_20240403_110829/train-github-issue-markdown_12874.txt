ansible 0.8 (devel `761330b`) last updated 2012/10/04 10:13:36 (GMT +200)
Hello,
I have a host in the inventory which uses a non-standard SSH port (in my case:
2222).  
If I use delegate_to to delegate to another host, ansible connects to the host
(vz112.local) with the port from the host (10.20.20.208) which is processed by
the playbook (port 2222 in my case). Of course this fails.
It seems I'm not able to override the port via "delegate_to: otherhost:22".
Is this a bug, feature or do I something wrong?  
(Well, workaround is to use redir on the delegate_to host for now.)
Thanks,  
Dietmar
