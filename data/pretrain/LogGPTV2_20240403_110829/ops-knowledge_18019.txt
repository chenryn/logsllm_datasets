Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and coherent version of your text:

I have a daemon that uses a connection pool for handling `HandlerSocket` connections. I need to support two types of clients, each with its own protocol. My goal is to set up two listeners, each handling one of the protocols, while sharing the same connection pool between them.

In Twisted, this can be achieved relatively easily, but I'm struggling to find a way to do this in Gevent. Could you provide some guidance on how to accomplish this in Gevent?

Additionally, I understand that the first instance of `StreamServer` can be started with `server.start()`, and the second instance with `server2.serve_forever()`.

Thank you!
