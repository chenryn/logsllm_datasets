In this simplified example I want to explain my problem using the grid-system.
When I understand the grid system right you can add as many cols as you like
in one row and when the 12-grids are full the next col break into the next
line.
Until rc1 the following example worked well but with the release of Bootstrap
3.0 I've got an error. I think it's because of the missing "float:left" on the
col-xs-12, col-sm-12 ... classes.
        Col 1
        Col 2
        Col 3
        Col 4
        Col 5
Can you tell me why the float:left has been removed with the rc2 of bootstap
3?
