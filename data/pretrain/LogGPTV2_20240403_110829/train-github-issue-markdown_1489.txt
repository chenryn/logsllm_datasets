### Bug report
The coordinates reported for `eclick` and `erelease` from the `onselect`
callback function don't match what was actually clicked on when drawing a
rectangle with `RectangleSelector`
**Code for reproduction**
    from matplotlib.backend_bases import MouseButton, MouseEvent
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    from matplotlib.widgets import RectangleSelector
    xdata = np.linspace(0,9*np.pi, num=301)
    ydata = np.sin(xdata)
    def rect_coords_from_clicks(eclick, erelease):
        x1, y1 = eclick.xdata, eclick.ydata
        x2, y2 = erelease.xdata, erelease.ydata
        print(f"You pressed at {(x1,y1)}, and released at {(x2,y2)}.")
    def on_press(event):
        print(f"You pressed {str(event.button)} at {(event.xdata, event.ydata)}.")
    def on_release(event):
        print(f"You released {str(event.button)} at {(event.xdata, event.ydata)}.")
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = ax.plot(xdata, ydata)
    rs = RectangleSelector(ax, rect_coords_from_clicks, button=[MouseButton.LEFT])
    plt.connect('button_press_event', on_press)
    plt.connect('button_release_event', on_release)
    plt.show()
**Actual outcome**
clicking the left mousebutton at ~(0,0), dragging the rectangle to ~(25,-1)
and then releasing results in the following
    You pressed MouseButton.LEFT at (0.028502352703939415, -0.009523809523809268).
    You pressed at (0.028502352703938527, -0.9976190476190476), and released at (24.922457204324836, -0.009523809523809268).
    You released MouseButton.LEFT at (24.922457204324836, -0.9976190476190476).
clicking the left mousebutton at ~(25,1), dragging the rectangle to ~(0,0) and
then releasing results in the following
    You pressed MouseButton.LEFT at (25.04786755622217, -0.9797619047619047).
    You pressed at (0.028502352703938527, -0.9797619047619047), and released at (25.04786755622217, 0.0023809523809525945).
    You released MouseButton.LEFT at (0.028502352703939415, 0.0023809523809525945).
The coordinates of click and release aren't respected by the onselect function
of RectangleSelector: the "click" coordinate is always the bottom left corner
of the rectangle and the "release" coordinate is always the top right corner.
The coordinates given by the `on_press` and `on_release` functions are always
correct.
**Expected outcome**
clicking the left mousebutton at ~(0,0), dragging the rectangle to ~(25,-1)
and then releasing results in the following
    You pressed MouseButton.LEFT at (0.028502352703939415, -0.009523809523809268).
    You pressed at (0.028502352703939415, -0.009523809523809268), and released at (24.922457204324836, -0.9976190476190476).
    You released MouseButton.LEFT at (24.922457204324836, -0.9976190476190476).
clicking the left mousebutton at ~(25,1), dragging the rectangle to ~(0,0) and
then releasing results in the following
    You pressed MouseButton.LEFT at (25.04786755622217, -0.9797619047619047).
    You pressed at (25.04786755622217, -0.9797619047619047), and released at (0.028502352703939415, 0.0023809523809525945).
    You released MouseButton.LEFT at (0.028502352703939415, 0.0023809523809525945).
The coordinates reported by `eclick` and `erelease` should match the actual
click and release coordinate.
