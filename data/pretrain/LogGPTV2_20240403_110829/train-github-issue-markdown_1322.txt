I'm using babel to transpile ES6 code, my target browsers support generators,
so I blacklist regenerator to improve performance, but webpack doesn't parse
it at all it seems. Generators could just be parsed and treated as functions.
I'm switching from browserify, which happens to parse generators correctly.
