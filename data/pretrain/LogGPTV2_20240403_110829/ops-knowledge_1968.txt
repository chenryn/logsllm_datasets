User: I have a code that creates file(s) in user-specified directory. User can point to a directory in which he can't create files, but he can rename it.
I have created directory for test purposes, let's call it C:\foo.  
I have following permissions to C:\foo:  

Traversing directory/Execute file  
Removing subfolders and files
Removing
Read permissions
Change permissions
Take ownership

I don't have any of the following permissions to C:\foo:  

Full Control  
File creation  
Folder creation  

I have tried following approaches, so far:

os.access('C:\foo', os.W_OK) == True  
st = os.stat('C:\foo')
mode = st[stat.ST_MODE]
mode & stat.S_IWRITE == True 
 
I believe that this is caused by the fact that I can rename folder, so it is changeable for me. But it's content - not. 
Does anyone know how can I write code that will check for a given directory if current user has permissions to create file in that directory?
In brief - I want to check if current user has File creation and Folder creation permissions for given folder name.
EDIT: The need for such code arisen from the Test case no 3 from 'Certified for Windows Vista' program, which states: 


The application must not allow the Least-Privileged user to save any files to Windows System directory in order to pass this test case.  


Should this be understood as 'Application may try to save file in Windows System directory, but shouldn't crash on failure?' or rather 'Application has to perform security checks before trying to save file?' 
Should I stop bothering just because Windows Vista itself won't allow the Least-Privileged user to save any files in %WINDIR%?
Assistant: I wouldn't waste time and LOCs on checking for permissions. Ultimate test of file creation in Windows is the creation itself. Other factors may come into play (such as existing files (or worse, folders) with the same name, disk space, background processes. These conditions can even change between the time you make the initial check and the time you actually try to create your file.
So, if I had a scenario like that, I would just design my method to not lose any data in case of failure, to go ahead and try to create my file, and offer the user an option to change the selected directory and try again if creation fails.
