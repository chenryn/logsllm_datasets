User: I want to get the full command line as it was typed.
This:
" ".join(sys.argv[:])
doesn't work here (deletes double quotes). Also I prefer not to rejoin something that was parsed and split.
Any ideas?
Assistant: In a Unix environment, this is not generally possible...the best you can hope for is the command line as passed to your process.
Because the shell (essentially any shell) may munge the typed command line in several ways before handing it to the OS for execution.
