**User:**
I need to retrieve the full command line as it was originally typed. The following code:
```python
" ".join(sys.argv[:])
```
does not work in this context because it removes double quotes. Additionally, I prefer not to reassemble something that has already been parsed and split. Do you have any suggestions?

**Assistant:**
In a Unix-like environment, it is generally not possible to directly retrieve the exact command line as it was typed. The best you can achieve is the command line as it was passed to your process by the operating system.

This is because the shell (regardless of which one you are using) may modify the command line in several ways before passing it to the OS for execution. As a result, the original formatting and quoting are often lost.

If you need to preserve the original command line, you might consider alternative approaches, such as logging the command line before it is passed to the script or using a wrapper script to capture and pass the original input.
