Insikt Group® researchers used proprietary Recorded Future Network Traffic 
Analysis and RAT controller detections, along with common analytical techniques, to 
identify and profile a cyberespionage campaign attributed to a suspected Chinese 
state-sponsored threat activity group, which we are tracking as RedDelta.
Data sources include the Recorded Future® Platform, Farsight Security’s 
DNSDB, SecurityTrails, VirusTotal, Shodan, BinaryEdge, and common OSINT 
techniques. 
This report will be of greatest interest to network defenders of private sector, 
public sector, and non-governmental organizations with a presence in Asia, as well 
as those interested in Chinese geopolitics.
Executive Summary
From early May 2020, The Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of 
Hong Kong were among several Catholic Church-related organizations 
that were targeted by RedDelta, a Chinese-state sponsored threat 
activity group tracked by Insikt Group. This series of suspected network 
intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the 
Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations 
have not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity 
groups prior to this campaign.
These network intrusions occured ahead of the anticipated 
September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional 
agreement, a deal which reportedly resulted in the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) gaining more control and oversight over the country’s 
historically persecuted “underground” Catholic community. In addition 
to the Holy See itself, another likely target of the campaign includes 
the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose 
predecessor was considered to have played a vital role in the 2018 
agreement.
The suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta 
insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal’s 
September 2020 renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission 
and its Catholic Diocese could also provide a valuable intelligence source 
for both monitoring the diocese’s relations with the Vatican and its 
position on Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement amidst widespread 
protests and the recent sweeping Hong Kong national security law.
While there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of 
RedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as Mustang 
Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are 
a few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as 
RedDelta:
The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses 
a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different 
configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.
The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been 
publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.
In addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church, 
Insikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and 
government entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.
Key Judgments
The targeting of entities related to the Catholic church is likely 
indicative of CCP objectives in consolidating control over the 
“underground” Catholic church, “sinicizing religions” in China, and 
diminishing the perceived influence of the Vatican within China’s 
Catholic community.
Due to RedDelta’s targeting of organizations that heavily align to 
Chinese strategic interests, use of shared tooling traditionally used 
by China-based groups, and overlaps with a suspected Chinese 
state-sponsored threat activity group, Insikt Group believes that 
the group likely operates on behalf of the People’s Republic of 
China (PRC) government.
The identified RedDelta intrusions feature infrastructure, tooling, 
and victimology overlap with the threat activity group publicly 
reported as Mustang Panda (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT 
and HoneyMyte). This includes the use of overlapping network 
infrastructure and similar victimology previously attributed to this 
group in public reporting, as well as using malware typically used 
by Mustang Panda, such as PlugX, Poison Ivy, and Cobalt Strike.

Threat Analysis
Overview of Catholic Church Intrusions
Using Recorded Future RAT controller detections and network traffic analysis 
techniques, Insikt Group identified multiple PlugX C2 servers communicating with 
Vatican hosts from mid-May until at least July 21, 2020. Concurrently, we identified 
Poison Ivy and Cobalt Strike Beacon C2 infrastructure also communicating with 
Vatican hosts, a Vatican-themed phishing lure delivering PlugX, and the targeting 
of other entities associated with the Catholic Church. 
The lure document shown above, which has been previously reported on in 
relation to links to Hong Kong Catholic Church targeting, was used to deliver a 
customized PlugX payload that communicated with the C2 domain systeminfor[.]
com. The document purported to be an official Vatican letter addressed to the 
current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China. It is currently unclear 
whether the actors created the document themselves, or whether it is a legitimate 
document they were able to obtain and weaponize. Given that the letter was 
directly addressed to this individual, it is likely that he was the target of a 
spearphishing attempt. Additionally, as this sample was compiled after signs of 
an intrusion within the Vatican network, it is also possible that the phishing lure 
was sent through a compromised Vatican account. This hypothesis is supported by 
the identification of communications between PlugX C2s and a Vatican mail server 
in the days surrounding the sample’s compilation date and its first submission to 
public malware repositories.
Background
China and the Catholic Church
For many years, Chinese state-sponsored groups have targeted religious 
minorities within the the PRC, particularly those within the so-called “Five 
Poisons,” such as Tibetan, Falun Gong, and Uighur muslim communities. Insikt 
Group has publicly reported on aspects of this activity, such as our findings on 
RedAlpha, the ext4 backdoor, and Scanbox watering hole campaigns targeting the 
Central Tibetan Administration, other Tibetan entities, and the Turkistan Islamic 
Party. Most recently, a July 2020 U.S. indictment identified the targeting of emails 
belonging to Chinese Christian religious figures — a Xi’an-based pastor, as well as 
an underground church pastor in Chengdu, the latter of whom was later arrested 
by the PRC government, by two contractors allegedly operating on behalf of the 
Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). Regional branches of China’s Ministry 
of Public Security (MPS) have also been heavily involved in digital surveillance of 
ethnic and religious minorities within the PRC, most notably by the Xinjiang Public 
Security Bureau (XPSB) in the case of Uighur muslims.
Historically, the PRC has had a highly turbulent relationship with the Vatican 
and its governing body, the Holy See. In particular, the Holy See’s recognition 
of bishops within China’s historically persecuted “underground” Catholic church 
traditionally loyal to the Vatican and its relationship with Taiwan has maintained 
an absence of official relations since the 1950s. The CCP perceived this behavior 
as the Holy See interfering in religious matters within China. In September 2018, 
the PRC and the Holy See reached a landmark two-year provisional agreement, 
marking a significant step towards renewed diplomatic relations. 
Under the provisional agreement, China would regain more control over 
underground churches, and the Vatican in turn would gain increased influence 
over the appointment of bishops within the state-backed “official” Catholic church. 
The deal was met with a mixed reaction, with critics arguing that the deal was 
a betrayal of the underground church and would lead to increased persecution 
of its members. Many of the harshest criticisms came from clergy within Hong 
Kong. A year after the agreement, numerous reports noted the Vatican’s silence in 
response to the Hong Kong protests beginning in late 2019, in what critics called 
an effort to avoid offending Beijing and jeopardizing the 2018 agreement.

The head of the Hong Kong Study Mission is considered the Pope’s de facto 
representative to China and a key link between Beijing and the Vatican. The 
predecessor to this role played a key part in the finalization of the 2018 provisional 
China-Vatican agreement, making his successor a valuable target for intelligence 
gathering ahead of the deal’s expiry and likely renewal in September 2020. 
Further entities associated with the Catholic Church were also targeted by 
RedDelta in June and July 2020 using PlugX, including the mail servers of an 
international missionary center based in Italy and the Catholic Diocese of Hong 
Kong.
Insikt Group identified two additional phishing lures loading the same 
customized PlugX variant, which both communicated with the same C2 
infrastructure as the Vatican lure. The first sample included a lure document 
spoofing a news bulletin from the Union of Catholic Asian News regarding the 
impending introduction of the new Hong Kong national security law. The content 
of the lure file, titled “About China’s plan for Hong Kong security law.doc,” was 
taken from a legitimate Union of Catholic Asian News article. The other sample also 
references the Vatican using a document titled “QUM, IL VATICANO DELL’ISLAM.
doc” for the decoy document. This particular decoy document translates as “Qum, 
the Vatican of Islam,” referring to the Iranian city of Qum (Qom), an important 
Shi’ite political and religious center. It is taken from the writings of Franco Ometto, 
a Italian Catholic academic living in Iran. Although the direct target of these two 
lures are unclear, both relate to the Catholic church.
We believe that this targeting is indicative of both China’s objective in 
consolidating increased control over the underground Catholic Church within 
China, and diminishing the perceived influence of the Vatican on Chinese Catholics. 
Similarly, a focus on Hong Kong Catholics amid pro-democracy protests and the 
recent sweeping national security law is in line with Chinese strategic interests, 
particularly given the Anti-Beijing stance of many of its members, including former 
Hong Kong Bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun.
Other Targeted Organizations
Insikt Group identified several additional suspected victims communicating 
with RedDelta C2 infrastructure. While metadata alone does not confirm a 
compromise, the high volume and repeated communications from hosts within 
targeted organizations to these C2s are sufficient to indicate a suspected 
intrusion. A full list of identified targeted organizations are summarized below:

lure document (right).

The organizations targeted by RedDelta in this campaign largely align 
with historical activity publicly reported on the threat activity group Mustang 
Panda, with the group previously linked to intrusion attempts targeting the Police 
of the Sindh Province in Pakistan, law enforcement organizations in India, and 
the targeting of entities within Myanmar, Hong Kong, and Ethiopia. The group is 
also suspected to have previously targeted China Center (China Zentrum e.V), 
a non-profit organization whose members includes Catholic aid organizations, 
religious orders and dioceses in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, and other 
organizations associated with religious and minority groups. 
Infrastructure Analysis
In this campaign, RedDelta favored three primary IP hosting providers, and 
used multiple C2 servers within the same /24 CIDR ranges across intrusions. 
Preferred hosting providers included 2EZ Network Inc (Canada), Hong Kong 
Wen Jing Network Limited, and Hong Kong Ai Jia Su Network Limited. The group 
consistently registered domains through GoDaddy, with WHOIS data providing 
additional linkages between domains used by the threat activity group. Insikt 
Group identified two primary clusters of RedDelta infrastructure used throughout 
this campaign, referred to as the “PlugX cluster” and the “Poison Ivy and Cobalt 
Strike cluster.” A Maltego chart is included below displaying these clusters.

‘Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian’ and the PlugX 
Cluster
Vatican hosts and several other victim organizations were communicating 
with the PlugX C2 167.88.180[.]5 from May until June 10, 2020. This IP hosted the 
domain cabsecnow[.]com over this time period. Cabsecnow[.]com then resolved to 
a new IP, 103.85.24[.]136, from June 10 onwards. The suspicious network activity 
continued after the C2 IP was updated, increasing our confidence in the likelihood 
of intrusion at the targeted organizations.
The cabsecnow[.]com domain shares a similar naming convention to a publicly 
reported domain linked to Mustang Panda, cab-sec[.]com. WHOIS data revealed 
that both domains were registered several seconds apart through GoDaddy on 
September 17, 2019, with the same registrant organization listed: “Ma Ge Bei Luo 
Xiang Gang Jiu Dian.” This registrant organization is associated with eight domains 
in total, five of which have previously been publicly linked to Mustang Panda 
activity by Anomali and Dell SecureWorks. “Ma Ge Bei Luo Xiang Gang Jiu Dian” 
translates from Mandarin to Marco Polo Hotel Hong Kong, a legitimate Hong Kong 
hotel, although it is unclear why the actor chose this organization when registering 
these domains.
Another PlugX C2, 85.209.43[.]21, was also identified communicating with 
several hosts within the same targeted organizations (see Table 1). This IP has 
hosted ipsoftwarelabs[.]com since November 2019, a domain previously identified 
as a Mustang Panda PlugX C2. 
Finally, the C2 domain associated with the Vatican and Union of Catholic 
Asian News lures, systeminfor[.]com, was hosted on 167.88.180[.]32 since June 
2020. This IP has also hosted lameers[.]com since February 2020, another PlugX 
C2 identified in activity targeting Hong Kong.
