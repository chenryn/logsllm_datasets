    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    foo.c:
    #include "_cgo_export.h"
    void test() {
        Test(1,2,3);
    }
    foo.go:
    package main
    //void test();
    import "C"
    import "fmt"
    //export Test
    func Test(val C.int, val2 C.double, val3 C.double) {
        fmt.Println(float64(val), float64(val2), float64(val3))
    }
    func main() {
        C.test()
    }
    What is the expected output?
    1 2 3

    Please provide any additional information below.
    Changing (val C.int -> val C.double) fixes the problem.
    "tapir" from github confirmed similar code was working fine on Arch linux
    32bit but not on windows.
