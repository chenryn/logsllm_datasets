Most TDS programs are open source applications. This means that their source codes 
can easily be reviewed and analyzed even for undocumented use such as for exploiting 
zero-day vulnerabilities. How? Figure 6 shows the steps to follow in order to find a 
TDS, to detect its version, and to gain control of it.
Figure 6. Steps	usually	followed	to	gain	control	of	TDSs
The example above is based on a compromised traffic direction controller created 
using one of the most popular pieces of software, Simple	TDS.	Further details of this 
compromised are provided below.
1.  Conduct a Google	search for the pattern inurl:“go.	php?sid=”.
2.  Analyze the results and list all of the sites that possibly use Simple	TDS.
3.  Detect the software version by accessing the header.php	file in the root folder of 
the TDS.
4.  The version vulnerabilities that can be exploited depend on what Simple	TDS	
version a site owner uses.
The steps above are usually followed when compromising TDSs in order to steal 
statistical data and to hijack traffic from hacked TDSs. These are effectively used to 
compromise vulnerable TDS software or those with weak passwords and with unlimited 
server user rights.

Targeted attacks refer to those that prey on certain users, use various social 
engineering techniques, and utilize specially crafted malware. TDSs have made it 
possible for cybercriminals to choose either specific targets or wide-ranging groups, 
depending on their geographic locations, software preferences, and language settings; 
to deploy and distribute malware; and to steal critical information.
TDSs’ traffic filtering and direction control functions allow cybercriminals to select 
certain possible victims or groups of victims.
Filtering by user agent allows cybercriminals to choose their targets according to their 
language preferences. The traffic filtering function of TDSs allows them to redirect 
certain users to malicious landing pages that use their chosen languages. This filtering 
method is always used in combination with users’ geographic locations based on their 
IP addresses. Different language preferences and geographic locations, however, 
require localization and internationalization of malicious sites’ content.
Filtering by OS and by browser vendor and by their corresponding versions allows 
cybercriminals to determine what specific vulnerability and exploit kit as well as what 
exploit code to use. They can, for instance, inject a 0 x 0 iframe on their TDSs, which 
are capable of handling requests from invisible iframes. To do this, their TDSs should 
be able to do the following:
1.  Handle user requests from legitimate sites that have been compromised via a  
0 x 0 iframe injection.
2.  Handle users’ HTTP requests sent via clicking an invisible iframe.
3.  Handle users’ HTTP requests that have been initiated, redirected, or pushed by the 
iframe to the TDS’s gateway.
4.  Collect browser, OS, referer, and language settings information from the HTTP 
requests sent to the TDS and combine these with the user’s geographical location 
based on IP address in order to decide where to redirect these.

As previously mentioned, provisional traffic can be used to pay for the use of some 
TDS software for legitimate marketing purposes, for promoting adult sites, for legitimate 
and blackhat SEO purposes, and for pay-per-click (PPC) as well as PPI schemes.
In the provisional traffic scheme, the total amount of traffic can be shared by the 
players involved. An adult site owner, for instance, can use Advanced	TDS	to direct 
traffic to his/her site. To do so, however, he/she needs to pay the software developer 
1% of the total amount of traffic as intellectual property fee. If the developer cannot use 
all of the traffic he/she receives, he/she can resell this in the Partnerka traffic/affiliate 
program traffic market in order to profit. Traffic brokers then buy and filter traffic before 
reselling it to PPC business owners. On the other side of the equation, unsuspecting 
users who click links to the adult site end up with infected systems.
In some cases, highly popular and high-ranking sites make use of 404 requests to 
nonexistent sites that have been redirected to their servers by selling these in the traffic 
market. Some of the filtered traffic, unfortunately, ends up on adult sites or on exploit 
pages. As a result, unsuspecting users’ systems are unintentionally infected. Reselling 
404 traffic is now becoming a popular trend.

The traffic that iframes usually redirect comprises a combination of traffic based on 
browser, OS, referer, language settings, and geographic location. In cases where traffic 
is not recognized by the TDS, the site owner classifies this as mixed and either tries to 
sell it to others or to make the best use of it.
The traffic market has several defined sections for particular industries, including  
the following:
1.	 Pharmaceutical:	This industry uses traffic bought to boost sales and to promote 
new bogus products. It constantly requires and buys traffic, regardless of source. 
Pharmaceutical site owners filter the traffic they buy based on more specific 
parameters, for which they use a variety of TDS-like techniques.
2.	 Adult:	Like pharmaceutical sites, adult sites require huge amounts of traffic to 
sell their products or services to. To obtain traffic, adult site owners buy mixed 
or prefiltered traffic based on the users’ regions and language preferences. To 
maximize profits from the traffic, they further filter it to determine which landing 
pages each user should be directed to. It is interesting to note that some of the 
traffic bought from nonadult site marketplaces is filtered by time of day. As such, 
certain users are directed to pharmaceutical sites during the day but end up on 
adult sites at night.
3.	 PPI:	PPI business owners are known for deploying malicious code and for infecting 
unsuspecting users’ systems. They are paid based on the number of user systems 
the traffic they sold infected. This means that the better they filter traffic, the more 
money they earn. They are usually hired by partner or affiliate program members. 
The number of infected systems is equal to the number of phone-home calls sent 
to their servers. The infected systems form malicious networks of bots or computer 
zombies that we know as “botnets.”

conclusion
Directing web traffic has become a new  
form of online networking business. The  
increasing amount of web traffic or of the  
number of user clicks to be directed to the  
right web pages or sites has given rise to  
new challenges.
As shown, directing web traffic can be good or bad. It can be  
good in that when a user clicks a link to a legitimate site, he/she  
lands on a page on a site that was specifically created for users  
like him/her in terms of language and the like. It can also be bad in  
the sense that some users are redirected to malicious pages or sites  
with a single mouse click.
Security challenges with regard to web traffic direction are becoming clearer and more 
evident. User redirection to malicious pages or sites has given rise to the importance 
of understanding TDSs. The possibility of blocking redirection to prevent users from 
landing on bad sites is thus becoming a valid concern.
The malicious use of TDSs and the practice of leading unknowing users to bad 
sites is becoming commonplace. Preventing product or service consumers from 
becoming victims will present the security industry with various technological and 
financial challenges, as the malicious use of various TDSs will require better sourcing 
techniques, more advanced detection and blocking tactics, as well as greater 
manpower to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
