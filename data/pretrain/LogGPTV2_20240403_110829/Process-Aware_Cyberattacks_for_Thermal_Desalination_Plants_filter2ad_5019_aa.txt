ABSTRACT
In 2017, desalination industry was contracted to produce 99.8 mil-
lion m3/d of fresh water globally. In regions with a natural shortage
of fresh water, desalination contributes up to 70% of drinking wa-
ter. While state-of-the-art research has focused on securing the
power grid, water treatment plants, and other critical infrastruc-
ture, not much attention has been given towards desalination plants.
In this work, we perform interdisciplinary cyber threat analysis on
a desalination plant model, presenting cyberattacks and analyzing
their effect on the plant performance and equipment both from
economics and mechanical engineering perspective. Our analysis
shows that cyber actors can perform extensive financial damage
by affecting the performance of the plant. We also perform control
volume analysis and finite element analysis studies to investigate
the possibility of Stuxnet-like attacks with the potential to cause
mechanical damage and equipment failure.

1 INTRODUCTION
Over 97% of the water on earth is seawater and is unsuitable for
consumption due to its salinity. Another 2% is fresh water stored
in the form of icecaps and glaciers, leaving 0.5% of fresh water
on earth available for human consumption. Pollution has led to
further decrease in the amount of usable water and many regions

around the world do not have abundant fresh water supply for
consumption [20]. Currently, approximately 1.2 billion people live
in areas of water scarcity, and this figure is estimated to grow to
1.8 billion by 2025 [21].
Due to the limited supply of fresh water, researchers and the wa-
ter industry have turned towards desalination: purification of saline
water. Desalination is the process of separation of nearly salt-free
fresh water from sea water and has been a field of ongoing research.
Due to its extremely dry climate, the gulf region has been a “hot
spot" for desalination advancement for alleviating water shortage.
Increase in the demand of water has shifted focus to desalination
as an alternative to fresh water for alleviating water shortage. In
Saudi Arabia, desalination technology supplies approximately 60%
of water demand in the country and produces more than 70% of
the country’s drinking water [9].
Despite the advances in desalination, the process is still expen-
sive, complex, requires a steady state operation for optimum uti-
lization of input resources, and also leads to some localized adverse
impact on the ecosystem [14]. For instance, Multi-Stage Flash (MSF)
desalination is a form of thermal desalination process which con-
sumes about 5 to 6 KWh per m3 and costs between $0.62 - $1.97
per m3 of fresh water produced, based on the capacity of the de-
salination plant [14]. Steady state optimum utilization of input
resources involves a close coordination between various activities
performed by different parts of the plant. Moreover, the start-up
procedure for a desalination plant is complicated and involves a
strict sequence of steps and procedures to guarantee the safety
of the plant [31]. Currently, desalination plants have both semi-
automatic and fully-automatic start-up. Semi-automatic startup
includes human operators performing crucial checks to guarantee
the safety of the plant. Due to complexity, newer plants are mov-
ing towards fully automated operation. This guarantees no human
error and also a steady-state operation during plant loading, but
also expands the cyber threat surface [29].
At the same time, the gulf region has also been a prominent tar-
get of high-profile attacks on critical infrastructure. Saudi Aramco,
the national petroleum and natural gas company of Saudi Arabia,
was severely impacted by the Shamoon malware in 2012, wiping
clean more than 75% of the company’s enterprise computers [36].
The malware has allegedly resurfaced in 2016. The Flame malware,
a computer worm which used Windows update to spread with so-
phisticated mechanisms for stealing information. This was the first
Windows malware that used Bluetooth for discovering neighboring
devices and to locate the infected machine. Moreover, it was written
in Lua, which allowed the Command and Control (C&C) server
to update the malware on the fly. The infamous Stuxnet, as well

main intent of stealing information. It spread using Microsoft Word
document with a zero-day kernel exploit [6]. These are some of the
prime examples of cyber warfare targeting the gulf region and its
critical infrastructure.
Research on attacking and securing critical infrastructure has
asymmetrically focused on a) the power grid, b) chemical processes,
and c) water treatment, due to their paramount importance in
critical infrastructure domain [16]. Despite the enormous growth
of desalination industry in the recent years, it is still part of the
definition of water-related critical infrastructure [8]. Therefore,
in order to address the lack of published work on cybersecurity
analysis of desalination plants, in this work we present:
(1) The first attempt, to the best of our knowledge, to perform
cybersecurity analysis of desalination plants. We analyze
and discuss cause and effect relationship of attacks that can
be initiated by compromising the sensors, controllers, and
actuators of the system modeled using Simulink.
(2) A novel methodology, using Finite Element Analysis (FEA),
to quantify the potential of cyberattacks to induce mechani-
cal damage and physically destroy components of a desali-
nation plant, similar to Stuxnet.
The goal of this work is to bring attention to cybersecurity re-
search on desalination plants and provide a set of attacks to be used
as benchmarks in order to develop defenses for the desalination
process. We particularly focus on process-aware cyberattacks that
target the process logic, causing performance degradation of the
process or mechanical failure [22]. In contrast, traditional IT at-
tacks exploit bugs in either the software or the hardware leading to
taking control of the computing devices (e.g., privilege escalation)
or causing denial-of-service.
2 RELATED WORK
Several serious cyber attacks to the Industrial Control System (ICS)
infrastructure have been reported over the last years [16]. These
attacks can be broadly divided into a) traditional information tech-
nology attacks targeting the enterprise computers of ICS companies
(such as Shamoon [36]), and b) operation technology attacks tar-
geting specifically the ICS process, which is also the focus of this
work.
In the latter category, the most famous case is Stuxnet, affecting
Windows-based PCs that program specific Siemens Programmable
Logic Controllers (PLCs). Compromised PLCs were reprogrammed
to modify the operation, leading to mechanical damage. The worm
initially entered the ICS network via a USB stick and went unde-
tected by automated-detection system by using a digital certificate
from a reliable company. The worm then spread inside the internal
ICS network looking for specific PCs and once it found them, it
first gathered data by spying on the operation and then used this
data to deceive the outside controllers. Meanwhile, the compro-
mised PLCs were reprogrammed to modify the operation which
lead to mechanical damage. Although, Iran did not release specific
details, it is estimated that Stuxnet destroyed 984 uranium enriching
centrifuges and decreased the efficiency of Iran’s nuclear program
by 30% [7]. Another such (experimental) attack was the Aurora
vulnerability, that was reported by U.S. Department of Energy’s
Figure 1: A typical Multi-Stage Flash desalination process.
Idaho laboratory. In this demonstration, the circuit breakers were
intentionally opened and closed out of phase to rest of the power
grid which caused damage to the connected generators. Out of
phase open and close results in high electrical current and torque
that is converted into mechanical stress possibly leading to failure.
Moreover, this attack can also damage connected power system
equipment such as motors and transformers [35]. While Aurora
was just a test, Ukraine’s power grid suffered a different fate when
it was targeted on December 24, 2015. Three Ukrainian regional
electricity distribution companies were attacked by coordinated
cyber attacks which were executed within 30 minutes of each other.
The attacks used spear email phishing to obtain access into the
business network, stealing VPN credentials. Once inside the ICS
network, adversaries issued commands to create service outage
and then performed denial-of-service attack on call centers [26]. A
follow-up attack on Ukraine also occurred in 2017.
Damn Vulnerable Chemical Process (DVCP) is an open-source
framework that specifically targets research on offensive strategies
in chemical processes. It includes simulations for Tennessee East-
man Process and Vinyl Acetate Process which allows researchers to
study the consequences of cyber attacks on ICS [25]. Similar work
has been done for investigating attack surface and corresponding
defense mechanism for smart grids [24], as well as the oil and gas
industry [32].
The closest academic work in the field of water treatment is the
Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed [27]. SWaT can be used to
assess the effectiveness of attack detection and to understand the
affects of failure, once the water treatment plant is compromised
[13]. SWaT, however, focuses on reverse osmosis-based water treat-
ment, which is fundamentally different compared to traditional
thermal-based desalination. Cyber-security analysis of water treat-
ment processes also appears in [4, 5]. These studies propose the
use of multiple delay-differential observers for fault detection and
isolation of a potential attack in water SCADA system. Observers
use an analytic approximation of the canal hydrodynamics, and
the model is capable of capturing the effect of both upstream and
downstream flows. They are configured to be insensitive to one
fault and sensitive to others, assuming no prior knowledge about
the inputs.
