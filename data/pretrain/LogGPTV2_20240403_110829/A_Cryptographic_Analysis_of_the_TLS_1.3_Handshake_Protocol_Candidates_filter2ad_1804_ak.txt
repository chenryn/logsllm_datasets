10 Conclusion
Our analyses of draft-05 and draft-dh are encouraging: both TLS 1.3 candidate handshake designs can
be shown to be cryptographically sound, even in terms of established stand-alone key exchange security
41
notions. The analyses also reveal some points where the security aspects allows for ﬂexibility and various
options without endangering security, as pointed out in Section 3.
From a theoretical viewpoint, our “cascading” approach to treat session resumption not as part of the
key exchange protocol, but as another symmetric-key protocol which is composed with the main handshake
protocol, is useful to tame the complexity of such analyses (here and in general). Working out the details
of this approach to get a full-ﬂedged compositional analysis of the TLS 1.3 candidates is a worthwhile
direction. Still, our results already conﬁrm the sound design of the handshake protocols, as we have shown
that the session keys can be safely used in the channel protocol and session resumption, and that session
resumption is itself a strongly secure key exchange protocol.

QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections):
A Proof of Theorem 5.2: Hybrid Argument
We provide here the details of the hybrid argument showing that if we restrict the adversary in Theorem 5.2
to a single Test query, this reduces its advantage by a factor at most 1/3ns (for the three stages in each of
the ns sessions).
The hybrid argument consists of a sequence of games Gλ for λ = 0, . . . , 3ns, where Gλ behaves like
Multi-Stage,D
except that the ﬁrst λ tested keys are the actual derived keys, and the remaining ones are

G
replaced by random ones (uniformly chosen from D). Here, however, we assume consistent replacements
in the sense that a Test query returns the previously returned key if a partnered session has already been
tested. In particular, if for a tested session there is a partner session among the ﬁrst λ tested sessions,
then we return the actual derived key, even if the now tested session comes after the λ’s Test query.
Note that, by construction, identical session identiﬁers yield identical keys, such that we cannot generate
inconsistencies by having partners (with identical identiﬁers) but diﬀerent keys. Also observe that G3ns

sessions). This means that G0 is identical to G

SKEYe3 for transcripts and second-stage (resp. third-stage) keys where B cannot decrypt the data in the
session identiﬁer (yet), since the data entering the identiﬁer are encrypted for transmission. We usually
write sid1 and sid2 = (sid1, sid+2) for the session identiﬁers for the ﬁrst and second stage, respectively,
denoting the second part of the stage-two identiﬁer as sid+2; we also write {sid+2} to denote the fact that
B only holds an encrypted version of the second part. Recall that sid3 = (sid2, “RMS”), hence we can
