which were also the focus of several blog posts by security
researchers in the past [14], [23], [29], [30]. Sjosten et al. [47]
presented the ﬁrst large-scale study and demonstrated how
extensions expose WARs which allow websites to identify
and enumerate the extensions installed in a user’s browser.
At the same time Starov and Nikiforakis [52] proposed the
use of DOM modiﬁcations as behavior-based ﬁngerprints
for extensions. They also conducted a user study with 854
participants and found that 14.1% of them had distinct sets
of extensions that could be detected by any website, thus,
uniquely identifying them. More recently, Gulyas et al. [24]
conducted a large user study with more than 16 thousand
participants and, using the ﬁngerprinting technique from [47],
found that 54.86% of users were uniquely identiﬁable based
on their installed extensions. An alternative approach that
relied on a timing-based side-channel attack was proposed
by Sanchez-Rola et al. [44]. The core of their attack relies
on the access control mechanism enforced by browsers to
prevent unauthorized access of extension resources that have
not been explicitly labeled as public, which implicitly reveals
the existence (or absence) of a speciﬁc extension. A variation
of their time-based attack was presented by Van Goethem and
Joosen [56] as part of their exploration of ﬁngerprinting attacks
that can link users’ isolated browsing sessions.
Apart from the ﬁngerprintability of extensions, prior work
also explored one dimension of privacy leakage due to exten-
sions. Motivated by the seminal work of Krishnamurthy and
Wills on privacy diffusion on the web [31] and leakage in
request towards third parties [32], Starov and Nikiforakis built
a dynamic analysis framework that detected the leakage of
information (e.g., browsing history and search queries) from
Chrome extensions to third parties [51]. Recent studies also
demonstrated in different contexts how publicly available data
could enable the inference of sensitive data [17] or lead to the
de-anonymization of users [54].
IX. CONCLUSIONS
With browser vendors
incorporating countermeasures
against cookie-based tracking, user tracking techniques that
rely on browser ﬁngerprinting are becoming increasingly
prevalent. As a result, modern browsers have recently intro-
duced (or announced) mechanisms for mitigating the effect
of such techniques. Nonetheless, recent research has exposed
vulnerabilities in those countermeasures and have also pro-
posed additional countermeasures. In this paper we presented
the largest study on the unicity of extension ﬁngerprints to date
and revealed their discriminatory effect in real-world settings
– apart from enabling attackers to uniquely identify a device
and track users, we outlined a de-anonymization attack that
leverages publicly available extension reviews for revealing the
user’s identity. We also conducted the ﬁrst study detailing how
attackers can infer sensitive or personal user information from
detected extensions. The practicality of our attacks is high-
lighted by our comprehensive exploration of multiple extension
ﬁngerprinting techniques (including two novel approaches) and
their evaluation under practical settings. Our experimental eval-
uation also demonstrated the robustness of our ﬁngerprinting
techniques against state-of-the-art countermeasures proposed
by the research community,
thus motivating the need for
14
additional research for potential countermeasures. Overall, we
hope that our research sheds more light on the risks users face
and leads users to a more critical view of extensions.
