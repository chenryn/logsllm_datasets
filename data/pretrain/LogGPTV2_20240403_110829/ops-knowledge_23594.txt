User: Can you make a universal python application that will run on both OSX and Windows? With the same menu system, etc? Or would you need to make different versions for each OS?
Assistant: Yes. You could build it with Qt for its interface and then you'll have to make judicious use of the os library to make sure that everything plays nicely no matter what operating system it's running on. However when it comes to packaging it for distribution, you'll have to do them separately. For Windows you can use py2exe, which will build a binary package which bundles in the Python runtime and all the libraries you use. I'm not sure how it works in Mac though.
