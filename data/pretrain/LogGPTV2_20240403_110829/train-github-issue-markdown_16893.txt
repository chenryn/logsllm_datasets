In the given forum entry, I outline a use case for splitting the handling of a
REST resource between several controllers. While, e.g. the methods PUT and
DELETE on a resource describe the setup and teardown of some kind of bucket,
the POST to the same URL creates new content in the bucket. These two kinds of
functionality are very different and thus may have two different business
service interfaces. Therefore a split in the controller to reflect this
distinction would be reasonable.
I would propose to consider, whether the rule that one resource can only
handled by a single controller should be extended to include the HTTP method,
so that different HTTP methods of the same resource can be handled in
different controllers.
