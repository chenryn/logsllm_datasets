User: Use Python to write a script that can read log files and count specific keywords.
Assistant: The following is a simple Python script that can read a text file and count the number of specific keywords: ```python import re # read log file filename = 'logfile.txt' with open(filename) as file: logs = file.read() # count keyword occurrences keywords = ['error', 'warning', 'info'] counts = dict.fromkeys(keywords, 0) for keyword in keywords: count = len(re.findall(keyword , logs, re.IGNORECASE)) counts[keyword] = count # Output result for keyword, count in counts.items(): print(keyword + ': ' + str(count)) ``` In this script, we first A file was opened and read. Then, we use the `re.findall()` function to count the number of occurrences of each keyword in the logs. Next, we print the result. The code can be run in any IDE or console that supports Python and is saved as a supplementary tool in the same directory as the log file. By default, it will search for three keywords including "error", "warning" and "info". To customize keywords, just change the `keywords` list in the code.
