pki scep-cert
Description Create an SCEP certificate enrollment object.
Syntax pki scep-cert object-name
Replace object-name with the name of the certificate you want to enroll (1-63 characters).
Mode Configuration mode
poap
Description Enables Power On Auto Provisioning (POAP).
Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016 | page 174
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
NOTE: After using the poap command, you must reboot the system. The device will return
to service in POAP mode.
Syntax [no] poap {enable | disable}
Default POAP mode is enabled by default on virtual appliances. However, the feature is disabled by
default on all physical devices.
Mode Configuration mode
Usage If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context com-
mand to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command.
radius-server
Description Set RADIUS parameters, for authenticating administrative access to the ACOS device.
Syntax [no] radius-server host {hostname | ipaddr} secret secret-string
[acct-port protocol-port]
[auth-port protocol-port]
[retransmit num]
[timeout seconds]
Default [no] radius-server default-privilege-read-write
Parameter Description
hostname | ipaddr Hostname or IP address of the RADIUS server.
secret secret-string Password, 1-128 characters, required by the RADIUS server for authentication
requests.
acct-port Protocol port to which the ACOS device sends RADIUS accounting information.
protocol-port
The default port is 1813.
auth-port Protocol port to which the ACOS device sends authentication requests.
protocol-port
The default port is 1812.
retransmit num Maximum number of times the ACOS device can resend an unanswered
authentication request to the server. If the ACOS device does not receive a reply
to the final request, the ACOS device tries the secondary server, if one is config-
ured.
If no secondary server is available, or if the secondary server also fails to reply
after the maximum number of retries, authentication fails and the admin is
denied access.
You can specify 0-5 retries. The default is 3 retries.
page 175 | Document No.: 410-P2-CLI-001 - 6/17/2016
A10 Thunder Series and AX Series—Command Line Interface Reference
Parameter Description
timeout seconds Maximum number of seconds the ACOS device will wait for a reply to an
authentication request before resending the request. You can specify 1-15 sec-
onds.
The default is 3 seconds.
default-privilege-read-write Change the default privilege authorized by RADIUS from read-only to read-
write. The default privilege is used if the Service-Type attribute is not used, or
the A10 vendor attribute is not used.
This is disabled by default; if the Service-Type attribute is not used, or the A10
vendor attribute is not used, successfully authenticated admins are authorized
for read-only access.
Default No RADIUS servers are configured by default. When you add a RADIUS server, it has the
default settings described in the table above.
You can configure up to 2 RADIUS servers. The servers are used in the order in which you add
them to the configuration. Thus, the first server you add is the primary server. The second
server you add is the secondary (backup) server. Enter a separate command for each of the
servers. The secondary server is used only if the primary server does not respond.
Mode Configuration mode
Example The following commands configure a pair of RADIUS servers and configure the ACOS device
to use them first, before using the local database. Since 10.10.10.12 is added first, this server
will be used as the primary server. Server 10.10.10.13 will be used only if the primary server is
unavailable.
ACOS(config)#radius-server host 10.10.10.12 secret radp1
ACOS(config)#radius-server host 10.10.10.13 secret radp2
ACOS(config)#authentication type radius local

restore
Description Restore the startup-config, aFleX policy files, and SSL certificates and keys from a file previ-
ously created by the backup system command. The restored configuration takes effect fol-
lowing a reboot.
NOTE: Backing up system from one hardware platform and restoring it to another is not
supported.
Syntax restore [use-mgmt-port] url
Parameter Description
use-mgmt-port Uses the management interface as the source interface for the
connection to the remote device. The management route table is
used to reach the device. By default, the ACOS device attempts to
use the data route table to reach the remote device through a data
interface.
url File transfer protocol, username (if required), and directory path.
You can enter the entire URL on the command line or press Enter
to display a prompt for each part of the URL. If you enter the entire
URL and a password is required, you will still be prompted for the
password. The password can be up to 255 characters long.
To enter the entire URL:
• tftp://host/file
• ftp://[user@]host[:port]/file
• scp://[user@]host/file
• sftp://[user@]host/file
Default N/A
Mode Configuration mode
Usage Do not save the configuration (write memory) after restoring the startup-config. If you do,
the startup-config will be replaced by the running-config and you will need to restore the
startup-config again.
To place the restored configuration into effect, reboot the ACOS device.

route-map
Description Configure a rule in a route map. You can use route maps to provide input to routing com-
mands, like the “redistribute” or “default-information originate” command for OSPF. See the
Network Configuration Guide for more information.
Syntax [no] route-map map-name {deny | permit} sequence-num
Parameter Description
map-name Route map name.
deny | permit Action to perform on data that matches the rule.
sequence-num Sequence number of the rule within the route map, 1-65535. Rules
are used in ascending sequence order.
The action in the first matching rule is used, and no further match-
ing is performed.
You do not need to configure route map rules in numerical order.
The CLI automatically places them in the configuration (running-
config) in ascending numerical order.
This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified route map rule,
where the following commands are available.
