# Skew Estimates and System Time Synchronization

The following data illustrates clock skew estimates for various locations and operating systems. The values are given in parts per million (ppm) and indicate the relative independence of the skew estimates from the measuring device itself.

### Location-Based Skew Estimates
- **Seattle, WA**: 12, 5.06, -58.02 ppm
- **Princeton, NJ**: 9, 15.12, -58.01 ppm
- **Boston, MA**: 14, 36.97, -57.91 ppm
- **U. Kingdom**: 21, 86.45, -58.18 ppm
- **Switzerland**: 21, 84.07, -58.40 ppm
- **India**: 16, 199.27, -59.60 ppm
- **Singapore**: 15, 93.55, -58.05 ppm
- **CAIDA Lab**: 5, 0.24, -57.98 ppm

### Operating System and NTP Influence on Skew Estimates
| OS on Laptop | NTP | TSopt Clock Skew Estimate (ppm) | System Clock Skew Estimate (ppm) |
|--------------|-----|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Red Hat 9.0  | No  | -58.20                          | -58.16                           |
| Red Hat 9.0  | Yes | -58.16                          | -0.14                            |
| Windows XP   | No  | -85.20                          | -85.42                           |
| Windows XP   | Yes | -84.54                          | 1.69                             |

**Observations:**
- NTP-based system time adjustments do not significantly affect the TSopt clock skews.
- Different operating systems running on the same hardware can have different TSopt clock skews.
- Without NTP-based system time adjustment, a device will have the same TSopt and system time clock skews.

### Study Limitations
- **Windows XP SP2 Power Management on Laptops**: Additional information leakage?
- **Minimum Data Requirements**: Further exploration is needed to understand the effects of temperature variation, power management, device load, and operating systems.

## Applications and Case Studies

### Honeyd 0.8b
- **Honeyd [Provos]**: A framework for virtual honeypots that simulates virtual computer systems at the network level.
- **Observation**: All virtual hosts in a honeyd virtual honeynet have approximately the same TSopt clock skew.
- **Example Plot**: For 100 honeyd virtual Windows XP machines on the same host.

### VMware Workstation
- **Configuration**: Five VMware Workstation virtual machines running Red Hat 9.0 and the host (also Red Hat 9.0).

### Deanonymizing Anonymized Network Traces
- **CAIDA Trace (2004-04-21)**: A 2-hour passive trace on a major OC-48 link with partial payload data and anonymized IP addresses.
- **CAIDA Trace (2004-04-28)**: Another 2-hour trace on the same link with no payload data and not anonymized.
- **Deanonymization Attempt**: Using our techniques, we believe we deanonymized a number of the IP addresses in the 2004-04-21 trace, but could not verify the success.

- **CAIDA Traces (2005-01-13 and 2005-01-21)**:
  - **Common IP Addresses**: 11,862
  - **Candidate Mappings**: 2,170, of which 1,902 (88%) were correct.
  - **Anonymization**: Prefixed-preserving, suggesting potential for additional deanonymizations.

### Other Possible Applications
- **Counting Devices Behind a NAT**: Even if not all devices are up simultaneously.
- **Tracking Physical Devices**: Providing additional information.
- **Forensic Evidence**: Determining whether a specific device was involved in an action.

### Present Defenses and Countermeasures
- **Disable TCP Timestamps Option**: This option is optional and can be disabled.
- **Do Not Include Real Timestamps**: The timestamps included in packets are only used by the sender and can be replaced with dummy values.
- **Simulate Different Clock Skews**: Make a device appear to have the clock skew of a different device.

### Open Problems
- **Temperature Variation**: Effects and potential information leakage.
- **Power Management**: Effects and potential information leakage.
- **Device Load**: Effects and potential information leakage.
- **Operating System**: Effects and potential information leakage.
- **Minimum Data Requirements**: Further exploration needed.

### Since 2005
- **Open Problems**: Useful to others, e.g., Steven Murdoch’s CCS 2006 paper, "Hot or Not: Revealing Hidden Services by their Clock Skew," which attacks Tor Hidden Services.

## Streaming Media and Encryption

### Example: Apple TV, Slingbox Pro, and Sony LocationFree LF-B20
- **Encryption and the Slingbox Pro**:
  - **Protection**: To safeguard user's viewing habits and content.
  - **Data Transmission**: Broken into many packets, each with variable bitrate encoding.
  - **Fingerprinting**: A unique fingerprint of a movie that survives encryption.

### Accuracy
- **Movie Identification Rates**:
  - **10 Minute Sample**: 62%
  - **40 Minute Sample**: 77%
  - **High Accuracy Movies**: 15 out of 26 movies, 40-minute traces, ≥ 98% accuracy.

## Deniable File Systems: A TrueCrypt Case Study

### Authors
- Alexei Czeskis, David St. Hilaire, Karl Koscher, Steven D. Gribble, Tadayoshi (Yoshi) Kohno, Bruce Schneier

### Protecting Your Data
- **Encryption**: Encrypting data alone may not be sufficient as attackers can demand passwords.
- **Methods of Obtaining Passwords**: Algorithmic, fines, jail, extortion, torture.

### Deniable File System (DFS)
- **Idea**: Hide the existence of a portion of the file system.
- **TrueCrypt Implementation**:
  - **Outer Volume**: Non-hidden, encrypted file with random free space.
  - **Inner Volume**: Stored inside a container, encrypted with a different password.

### Threat Model
- **One-Time Access**: Secret police seize the computer.
- **Intermittent Access**: Hard drive copied when crossing borders.
- **Regular Access**: Secret police break into the apartment daily.

### Information Leaks in TrueCrypt
- **Operating System**: Registry mentions mounted volumes, and recently used shortcuts reveal details.
- **Primary Applications**: MS Office auto-saves files to the C: drive, which can be recovered even after deletion.
- **Non-Primary Applications**: Google Desktop indexes and caches files from hidden volumes, making them recoverable.

### The Point
- **Complete DFS Challenges**: Every process that reads data could store it elsewhere.
- **Need for Support**: OS and hardware support are essential.

### Exploring Attacks Against Future Systems

### Properties of These Projects

- **Physical Access Control**: Based on visibility, with limitations like 360-degree vision and potential wall penetration.

### Gaming the System
- **Location Determination**: Relies on "person" tags, which can be cloned or misused.
