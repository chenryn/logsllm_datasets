the exit position, we focus on the position for which the capacity is most limited
and the eﬀects of poor load balancing thus most impactful.
We show the results in Fig. 5b. Among the high-uptime exits (for which
we might have expected little undiscovered bandwidth), there are large relative
discovered capacities among the largest quarter by capacity after the speed test,
ranging from 10.2% in the third quartile to 91.0% at maximum. Moreover, larger
amounts of capacity are clearly still discovered among the largest exits, with a
median of 375 Mbit/s capacity among the relays in the highest quartile of relative
discovered capacity, compared to 124 Mbit/s, 34.6 Mbit/s, and 94.8 Mbit/s in the
median for the third to ﬁrst quartiles, respectively. This is despite the fact that
relays are ranked by relative discovered capacity, which means that not only do
the largest exits have the largest total error in capacity measurement, they have
the largest fraction of capacity error. This is consistent with a hypothesis that
the largest Tor relays are unable to attract enough traﬃc to recognize their true
capacity. It shows a consistent bias in the Tor bandwidth measurement system
against large relays, which consequently is likely to cause the Tor weights to be
too low for such relays, reducing Tor performance overall. Note that these results
are shown by absolute discovered capacity in the Appendix.
Eﬀects on Load Balancing. To understand how Tor load balancing is aﬀected
by its biased capacity estimation, we analyze the relay selection probabilities
before and after the speed test. Our speed test is designed to investigate the
advertised bandwidths, and the resulting eﬀects on the weights are complicated
both by any changes in the relay population and by the somewhat complex
eﬀects of the TorFlow load balancing system. However, Greubel et al. [15] ﬁnd
high correlation between the advertised bandwidths and the Tor weights that
determine the selection probabilities, and Tor’s load-balancing goal is indeed to
choose each relay proportional to its capacity. Therefore, we expect biases in the
advertised bandwidths to result in suboptimal selection probabilities.
Figure 6 shows the change in selection probabilities caused by the speed test.
Relays are divided into quartiles by the total amount of discovered capacity. We

can clearly see that, as expected, the relays with the largest discovered capacity
experienced the largest increases in their selection probabilities. For relays ranked
in the top quartile, the change in the median selection probability is 0.002% (a
20.3% relative increase), while at P90 we observe an even more extreme weight
change of 0.021% (a 267% relative increase).
5 Discussion
Throughout the paper, we have highlighted the performance implications of Tor’s
capacity estimation errors. We note further that the bandwidth estimation errors
we have observed have security implications. A primary security mechanism Tor
uses is to make it expensive to run a large fraction of the network by requiring a
large amount of bandwidth to observe a large fraction of client traﬃc. It accom-
plishes this by making the selection weights highly correlated with (i.e., roughly
proportional to) the advertised bandwidths [15]. The errors we have discovered
allow an adversary to more cheaply attract and attack client connections (e.g.,
traﬃc correlation [23] or website ﬁngerprinting [29]). Our results imply that an
adversary can gain an advantage by maintaining many high-uptime relays each
with low capacity. Moreover, we show that the sensitive exit and guard positions
are vulnerable to this exploitation.
Thus, an adversary could run a large number of low-bandwidth relays for
many weeks as both exits and (eventual) guards. Simply due to the bias of
Tor’s measurement system, those relays would obtain higher total weight than
the relative cost of running them. Running additional relays simply requires
additional IP addresses, due to Tor’s limit of two relays per IP address. Therefore,
assuming bandwidth is the dominant cost, the adversary would spend less to
observe and attack a given amount of client traﬃc than if the network bandwidth
were accurately measured. The adversary could use its relays to deanonymize
clients via known attacks.
We further observe that our speed test could be executed by a malicious
party to direct more client traﬃc to any subset of the Tor network, by rais-
ing the advertised bandwidths of relays in that subset and thus their weights.
Easier attacks to inﬂate malicious relay bandwidth are already known [5,20–
22,33]. However, in this attack the adversary need not control the relays to
which it directs traﬃc. For example, a malicious network adversary (e.g., an
ISP or nation-state) is able to direct more client traﬃc to relays on networks it
can observe, without running any of those relays. Such an ability again would
enable deanonymization attacks on the connections thus directed. This ability
also enables denial-of-service by allowing the adversary to artiﬁcially increase
the weights of a subset of the network, overloading those relays and degrading
network performance.

6 Conclusion
Estimates of Tor relays’ forwarding capacity are used to balance client traﬃc
load across relays and therefore accurate estimates are vital to the performance
and security of the Tor network. We analyzed the accuracy of Tor relay capacity
estimation using passive measurements of relay bandwidth that are published by
Tor metrics [3]. We found signiﬁcant variation in relays’ advertised bandwidths
which indicates inaccurate estimation; higher variation was associated with lower
capacity relays and relays that were online less frequently. We further explore
the accuracy of Tor capacity estimation techniques through an active speed test
experiment on the live Tor network. Through this experiment, we ﬁnd that Tor
underestimates its total capacity by about 50%, and that most relays increased
their capacity estimate following our experiment (some by a 10× or greater
factor). We also found that higher capacity relays and exit relays discovered more
capacity than lower capacity and non-exit relays, respectively, and that relays
with lower uptimes were correlated with higher discovered capacity. Our results
suggest that improvements to capacity estimates could signiﬁcantly improve load
balancing, which could lead to better network performance and security.

Appendix
Figure 7 shows for each relay position the uptime by absolute discovered capacity
quartiles. We observe that for all positions relays with higher discovered capacity
have higher uptime, although we notice that guard relays have higher overall
uptime (due to the additional uptime and stability requirements to get the Guard
ﬂag), and middles have a larger number of relays with low uptime.
Figure 8 shows the capacity of guard and middle relays after the speed test
by quartiles of relative discovered capacity. It includes only relays with at least
75% uptime. It shows that for high-uptime relays in both positions, most of the
discovered capacity is among the largest relays. We can especially see that for
middle relays, the low amount of discovered capacity is due to the large number
of relays with very little total or discovered capacity.
Figure 9 shows the eﬀect of relay capacity on the discovered capacity by
position when only relays with at least 75% uptime are considered.
