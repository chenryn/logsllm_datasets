When installing some git dependencies using the Docker image node:10-alpine
via `npm ci`, attempts to `npm prune --production` result in an error like:
    npm ERR! code 128
    npm ERR! Command failed: git clone --mirror -q https://github.com/nodecraft/ampify.git /root/.npm/_cacache/tmp/git-clone-6573274f/.git
    npm ERR! fatal: could not create leading directories of '/root/.npm/_cacache/tmp/git-clone-6573274f/.git'
To help replicate the issue, I have a directory that contains a `package.json`
and `package-lock.json`. I then have a `Dockerfile` which when building,
illustrates the issue.
I've created a repository at https://github.com/Cherry/npm-prune-ci-bug
detailing this, including commands to run to replicate the issue.
Last known working version: `6.10.3`. This issue does not occur if I use npm
version `6.10.3` or earlier.  
Tested versions that throw the above error:
    6.11.0
    6.11.1
    6.11.2
    6.11.3
    6.12.1
    6.13.1
It appears this regression was introduced in `6.11.0`, and exists through to
the latest version.
If I can provide any further information, please let me know.
