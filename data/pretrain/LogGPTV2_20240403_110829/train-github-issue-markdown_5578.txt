We have some actions that result in new files being created in the workspace.
We should respect the auto save setting and only save the file to disk if auto
save is enabled. Otherwise we can open the file dirty until saved.
**Old summary**
  * Have `"files.autoSave": "afterDelay"` in your settings
  * Open code on a new folder
  * Create a `hello.js` file and open it
  * Wait for the (ugly) green lightbulb in the bottom right corner to appear; click it and choose to create a `jsconfig.json` file.
The newly created `jsconfig.json` file will not be automatically saved. It
will instead display the unsaved icon and wait for me to save it.
