**Current behavior**  
When trying to render nested dynamic components via the
ComponentFactoryResolver I receive an exception/error message:
browser_adapter.js:84Error: Expression has changed after it was checked.
Previous value: 'CD_INIT_VALUE'. Current value: 'null'. It seems like the view
has been created after its parent and its children have been dirty checked.
Has it been created in a change detection hook ?
**Expected/desired behavior**  
It should render the nested dynamic controls. This had worked until the
introduction of the ComponentFactoryResolver.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
Here is the plunkr recreating the issue:

It's a duplicate of https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10762 except
that the solution provided does not work for ViewChildren, it only works for
ViewChild.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
I should be able to render a control via ComponentFactoryResolver which in
turn also renders multiple controls via ComponentFactoryResolver.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
It used to work.
