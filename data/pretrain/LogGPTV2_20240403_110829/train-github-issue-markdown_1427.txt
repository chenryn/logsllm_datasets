### Current Behavior
When attempting to render nested dynamic components using `ComponentFactoryResolver`, I encounter the following error:

```
browser_adapter.js:84 Error: Expression has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'CD_INIT_VALUE'. Current value: 'null'.
It appears that the view was created after its parent and children had already been checked for changes. Was this view created within a change detection hook?
```

### Expected Behavior
The nested dynamic components should be rendered successfully. This functionality worked prior to the introduction of `ComponentFactoryResolver`.

### Reproduction of the Problem
A Plunker reproducing the issue can be found here: [Plunker Example](http://plnkr.co/edit/BfqEYqNqyZuJDytt1DCc?p=preview)

This issue is similar to [Angular Issue #10762](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/10762), but the provided solution does not work for `ViewChildren`â€”it only works for `ViewChild`.

### Expected Behavior (Clarification)
I should be able to render a control via `ComponentFactoryResolver`, which in turn also renders multiple controls using `ComponentFactoryResolver`.

### Motivation / Use Case
This behavior used to work, and it is essential for maintaining the expected functionality in our application.

### Environment Details
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.5
- **Browser:** All
- **Language:** All
