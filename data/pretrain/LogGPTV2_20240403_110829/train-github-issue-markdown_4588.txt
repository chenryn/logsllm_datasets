Description:
When using bundle inheritance and template inheritance at the same time (where
one of the child bundle's templates extends one of the parent bundle's
templates), an error is thrown.
Expected outcome:
It should be possible to extend a parent bundle's template from a child
bundle's template.
How to reproduce:
https://gist.github.com/4226370
Note that this happens with all values of xdebug.max_nesting_level and also
with xdebug disabled (in this case the code keeps running until the process is
out of memory).
The following appear to be referencing the same issue, where a parent bundle's
template is also being extended by a child bundle's template:
