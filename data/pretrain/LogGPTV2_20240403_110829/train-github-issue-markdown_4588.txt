### Description
When using both bundle inheritance and template inheritance simultaneously—specifically, when a child bundle's template extends a parent bundle's template—an error is thrown.

### Expected Outcome
It should be possible for a child bundle's template to extend a parent bundle's template without any errors.

### Steps to Reproduce
Please refer to the following Gist for a detailed example:
- [Gist: Example of the Issue](https://gist.github.com/4226370)

**Note:** This issue occurs regardless of the value of `xdebug.max_nesting_level`. Even with Xdebug disabled, the code continues to run until the process runs out of memory.
