User: How to automate deployment? Please provide a specific tool and steps.
Assistant: 1. Tool: Jenkins 2. Steps: 1. Create a new task (Job) in Jenkins and select the free-style software project. 2. Configure the code warehouse address and branch information, and determine the build trigger method (such as code submission automatic trigger, timing trigger, etc.). 3. Configure the build step. You can choose to use Maven for packaging, or you can use Shell scripts for custom build operations, such as generating tarballs and running tests. 4. Configure the deployment step. Select the appropriate deployment scenario and environment (such as local, test environment, production environment), and fill in the corresponding deployment script. 5. Submit and save and manually execute a task, observe the build record and deployment output, and ensure that the entire automated deployment process can run normally. 6. If necessary, it can cooperate with Jenkins plug-ins and other tools (such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc.) for more advanced deployment management.
