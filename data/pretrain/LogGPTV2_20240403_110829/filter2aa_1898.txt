…Oh my….
What is Asymmetric Warfare
•Is it purely defensive
•Does it rely on traditional 
concepts
•How does an established fighting 
group use it
•Does it overlap with other 
computer security issues
Gosh….
What is Open Source Warfare
•Who uses it
•Who is it used against
•Are there any defenses
•Is it successful
•Where is it used

Warnings
A few things to remember:
• Although this stuff in very interesting it is used primarily 
in warfare….that means people actually die
• If you think you’re smart enough to try this on your own 
you are wrong! …and you could go to jail….
• Because of all this we will keep the examples simple, 
well known and generic…
• Importantly, this is a value neutral technical presentation: 
that means that we’ll only look at techniques and not 
evaluate whether the people using these methods are 
“right” or “wrong”, “justified” or “unjustified”

What types of things are used in OSW
• In a funny way this is a lot like McGyver
• Almost anything can be used…toothpicks, 
tin foil, matchbooks, string…..
• But on the contemporary battlefield it 
depends more heavily on things like 
mobile phones, microwave ovens, remote 
controlled aircraft, toy robots, digital 
cameras, sniffer tools

Let’s look at telecommunications
• Lebanon is a good example
– You may remember a few months ago that there was 
tremendous upset when the government attempted to 
quash third-party telecommunications networks
– In fact, it led to major fighting in the street
– To complicate matters the country also faces a 
number of external forces, Syria, Iran, Israel
– As well as a number of internal forces

Let’s look at telecommunications
• So what was the problem
– Third party groups had co-opted the telecom network 
set up by the government
• This was accomplished by “extending” copper networks
• Creating new optical networks
• Piggybacking on Mobile networks
– This also required technical knowledge as well as a 
heavy reliance on openly available public encryption, 
VOIP, chat room, message boards, anon email etc. 
communication methods
– So big did this become that it pretty much became an 
unsolvable issue for the government

So, let’s take a look at this map 
with overlays:
•First we see the regional 
context
•Next lets look at the geographic 
issues
•Now, the overlays of the 
networks (click, click)
•Secondly, lets look at why it 
was so difficult for these 
networks to be eliminated
•Thirdly, lets look at why 
publically available 
software/hardware tools have 
been so essential to the 
“success or failure” of the parties
•Finally, a word about undersea 
cables disruptions

Variants of this: Las Vegas
• Let’s look at the concept of triangulation
• Here’s a pretty picture of Las Vegas:

Variants of this: Las Vegas
• Now, let’s see it as a “protocol” map (click, 
click)
• This is all open source!

Variants of this: Las Vegas
• How do we triangulate?
• You can run but you can’t hide
• Now let’s think of this picture as a battlefield
– We’ll add some conceptual drones
– And figure out how to target an individual or group
– Note: this is a very useful method already employed –
think in terms of sniffer networks, GPS networks, geo-
location web 2.0 tricks
• IT’S ALL ABOUT THE MATH!!!!!

Open Source Platform
• Let’s take a look at OS surveillance platforms
• Here is a series of pictures of a RC helicopter 
with HD cam (next slide, pics only provided live 
at Defcon 16)
• Range: 2000 ft, 1 mile radius, 20 min battery life, 
encrypted com link
• Price $400.00 off the shelf 
• (no, I don’t have the vendors name, sorry)

A quick look at OS uses in the field
• Microwaves, IEDs, and the battle space
• Robotics at Ground Zero, Sept 2001
• Defeating LED and surveillance cameras
– Quick word on a counter measures
• The mobile phone quandary
– And the jamming quandary

A quick look at OS derivates
• Defcon 15 presentation regarding GPS 
device hacking
– Here’s a simulation example
• Defcon 14 presentation regarding rocketry
– Here’s a simulation example
– And here is an open source example of how 
model rockets utilize telemetry for guidance
– (yikes!)

And Finally
•
Overview of “mass-communication”
methods meant to influence a populace
–
Prep for a pending “attack”
–
Mass influence techniques
–
Reliance upon the “hacker” community for 
tools and methodology
–
Utilizing existing structures (e.g. social 
networks) for influence (good or ill)
–
Setting up a “Zeitgeist” scenario for 
influence
