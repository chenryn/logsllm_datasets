### Introduction
**Open Source Warfare (OSW)** is a critical and evolving concept in modern conflict. This presentation will explore the origins, use, and transformations of OSW, providing a comprehensive overview of its applications and implications.

---

### Asymmetric Warfare
- **Definition and Characteristics**
  - Is it purely defensive?
  - Does it rely on traditional concepts?
  - How do established fighting groups use it?
  - Does it overlap with other computer security issues?

- **Key Points to Consider**
  - Asymmetric warfare often involves non-traditional tactics and tools.
  - It can be used by both state and non-state actors.
  - The overlap with cybersecurity highlights the interconnected nature of modern threats.

### Open Source Warfare
- **Definition and Users**
  - Who uses it?
  - Who is it used against?
  - Are there any defenses?
  - Is it successful?
  - Where is it used?

- **Key Points to Consider**
  - OSW leverages open-source technologies and methods.
  - It can be employed by various groups, including insurgents and activists.
  - Defenses are challenging due to the decentralized and adaptive nature of OSW.
  - Success varies, but OSW has been effective in certain contexts.

### Warnings
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations**
  - Remember that these techniques are primarily used in warfare, where lives are at stake.
  - Attempting to use these methods without proper authorization is illegal and dangerous.
  - Examples provided will be simple, well-known, and generic to avoid misuse.
  - This presentation is value-neutral, focusing on technical aspects rather than moral judgments.

### Tools and Technologies in OSW
- **Diverse Applications**
  - Everyday items like toothpicks, tin foil, matchbooks, and string can be repurposed.
  - Modern battlefield tools include mobile phones, microwave ovens, remote-controlled aircraft, toy robots, digital cameras, and sniffer tools.

- **Telecommunications Example: Lebanon**
  - **Context**
    - Recent events in Lebanon highlight the complexity of OSW.
    - The government's attempt to control third-party telecommunications networks led to significant unrest.
    - External forces (Syria, Iran, Israel) and internal factions further complicate the situation.
  - **Techniques Used**
    - Extension of copper networks.
    - Creation of new optical networks.
    - Piggybacking on mobile networks.
    - Use of public encryption, VOIP, chat rooms, message boards, and anonymous email services.

- **Map Analysis**
  - Regional context.
  - Geographic issues.
  - Network overlays.
  - Challenges in eliminating these networks.
  - Importance of publicly available software and hardware tools.
  - Undersea cable disruptions.

### Variants: Las Vegas
- **Concept of Triangulation**
  - Visual representation of Las Vegas.
  - Protocol map for triangulation.
  - Techniques for targeting individuals or groups using drones, sniffer networks, GPS, and geolocation web 2.0 tricks.
  - Emphasis on the mathematical foundations of these methods.

### Open Source Surveillance Platforms
- **Example: RC Helicopter with HD Cam**
  - Range: 2000 ft, 1 mile radius.
  - Battery life: 20 minutes.
  - Encrypted communication link.
  - Cost: $400.00 off the shelf.

  - Simulation example.
- **Rocketry (Defcon 14)**
  - Simulation and open-source examples.
  - Telemetry for guidance in model rockets.

---

### Mass Communication and Influence
- **Methods for Influencing Populations**
  - Preparation for pending attacks.
  - Mass influence techniques.
  - Reliance on the hacker community for tools and methodology.
  - Utilizing existing structures (e.g., social networks) for influence.
  - Setting up a "Zeitgeist" scenario for influence.
