complexity on the basis of the MILP formulation and the
resulting scalability issues. As we concluded that the number
of demands is the most decisive factor in the solution time, we
proposed heuristics to reduce the problem size and ﬁnd near-
optimum greedy solutions. The experiments showed that there
is a tradeoff between optimum QoS and resilience and our
heuristics promise well-balanced solutions depending on the
problem size more than 106 times faster than MILP solution.
Considering the problem complexity, we limited the failure
scenarios to single node failures. Even though single random
failures are frequently used to cover common failure scenarios
in networks and distributed systems, more structured massive
node failures due to software crashes and vulnerabilities or
cyber-attacks are also real threats for embedded IoT networks.
Those scenarios will be also considered in our future work
in alternative topologies that reﬂect domain-speciﬁc network
characteristics.
