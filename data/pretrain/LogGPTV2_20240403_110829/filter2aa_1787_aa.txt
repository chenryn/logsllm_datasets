### Project Background

#### Why is This Interesting?

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in anti-privacy measures online. These include:
- **Media Company Pressure:** Media companies are pushing for stricter controls.
- **ISP Tracking and Throttling:** ISPs are monitoring and limiting arbitrary traffic.
- **Data Retention Laws:** Governments are enforcing data retention laws.
- **P2P User Surveillance:** Draconian laws for tracking and punishing P2P users.
- **Censorship via Blacklists:** Misuse of global network blacklists under the guise of child protection, leading to arbitrary censorship.
- **EU Law Proposals:** Proposed EU laws to register, track, and regulate all bloggers.
- **Censorship by Regimes:** Dictatorships and oppressive regimes are increasingly censoring and tracking internet use.

Given these trends, there is an inevitable demand for robust anonymity solutions. However, existing anonymization solutions are often not well-suited to meet this demand. There is no standard for anonymization akin to BitTorrent for P2P. This presents a perfect opportunity to develop a new, comprehensive solution from the ground up.

### Project Goals

The primary goals of the Phantom Protocol are:
1. **Reference for Future Work:** To serve as a reference for future anonymization research.
2. **Inspire Discussion:** To spark discussions about the optimal requirements for future anonymization needs.
3. **Global Standard:** To be a starting point and inspiration for designing a global de facto standard for generic anonymization.
4. **Foundation for Development:** Not to provide a complete, detailed specification but to lay the groundwork for further development.

### Limitations

The protocol is designed to function in any network environment, provided that no single attacker can eavesdrop on all participating nodes or control a large majority of them. Even if an attacker can monitor parts of the network, they will only see who is communicating, not the content of the communication. The protocol includes built-in countermeasures to protect against partial network monitoring.

---

### Assumptions and Directives

- **Compromised Peers:** It is assumed that some random peers in the network may be compromised or adversarial.
- **Resource Availability:** CPU power, network bandwidth, working memory, and secondary storage are relatively cheap and will become more abundant over time.
- **Security vs. Performance:** When choosing between better security and better performance, the most secure option should be chosen, within reasonable bounds.

### Design Goals

#### Overview

Well-defined design goals are crucial for the success of the project. These goals are formulated with current and future requirements in mind.

#### Primary Design Goals

1. **Complete Decentralization:**
   - No central or weak points should exist, as they will be targeted both legally and technically.
   - Both ownership and technical design must be decentralized, with open and community-owned source code.

2. **Maximum DoS Resistance:**
   - A decentralized system without legal owners can only be stopped by DoS attacks. Defensive thinking must be applied throughout the design to ensure resilience.

3. **Theoretically Secure Anonymization:**
   - Security should not rely on obscurity. All anonymization aspects should be based on risk probabilities or theoretical cryptographic proofs.

4. **Theoretically Secure End-to-End Encryption:**
   - Confidentiality is crucial for both privacy and anonymity. Even if all traffic is monitored, the content should remain hidden.

5. **Isolation from the "Normal" Internet:**
   - Users should not be exposed to internet crimes from their IP address. An isolated network is necessary to enforce end-to-end encryption for generic traffic. Out-proxies can still be implemented selectively.

6. **Protection Against Protocol Identification:**
   - Making it difficult to identify the protocol will make it harder to track, filter, and throttle. This is essential given the potential lobbying against such protocols.

7. **High Volume/Throughput Capacity:**
   - The protocol must support high traffic volumes and throughput to meet the increasing demands of internet usage. Popularity and anonymity are directly related to transfer speed and volume.

8. **Generic, Well-Abstracted, and Backward Compatible:**
   - A generic system is superior in the long run. A well-abstracted system allows for efficient, distributed design and implementation. Compatibility with existing network applications will facilitate quicker adoption and broader penetration.

### Basic Idea

The Phantom Protocol ensures that the IP addresses of communicating nodes (α and β) remain hidden. Each anonymized node prepares its own routing path, consisting of a series of intermediate nodes. Communication between two anonymized nodes is achieved by creating an interconnection between their individual routing paths.

---

### Detailed Design

#### Routing Paths

- **Node Selection:** Each anonymized node decides the size and composition of its routing path, affecting both the strength of anonymity and maximum throughput.
- **Routing Tunnels:** When an anonymized node wants to establish a connection, a "routing tunnel" is set up within the existing routing path. This tunnel is then connected to another tunnel in a different routing path to form a complete anonymized connection.

#### AP Addresses

- **Anonymous Protocol Addresses:** These are equivalent to IP addresses in format and functionality but allow communication without revealing identity. They are backward-compatible with IP applications.

#### Network Database

- **Distributed and Decentralized:** The network database is based on DHT (Distributed Hash Table) technology, providing automatic resilience to node changes and malicious activity.

#### Secure Routing Path Establishment

- **Node Selection and Ordering:** Nodes are selected and ordered according to specific rules to ensure security.
- **Goodie Box:** Each node receives a "goodie box" containing necessary information for secure communication, including routing certificates, IP addresses, and cryptographic keys.

#### Secure Routing Tunnel Establishment

- **Outbound Connection:** When an anonymized node wants to connect to a specific AP address, it sends a notification package through the routing path. New connections are created, and a reply package enables the node to derive the necessary information for the tunnel.

This structured approach ensures that the Phantom Protocol is robust, secure, and capable of meeting the growing demand for online anonymity.
