title:blackhat:eu-18 Attacking Hardware Systems Using Resonance and the Laws of Physics
Everything has a resonant frequency. By finding the resonant frequency of certain electronic sensors, programmable logic, and other devices, it is possible to subvert certain systems that are supposedly secured by the electronic components targeted in this research. From ultrasonic attacks on MEM's microphones in most voice enabled IoT and mobile equipment to high frequency electrical resonance inside certain programmable logic, these resonance attacks are all about leveraging physical properties of the target device and by chaining both these attacks and other hardware attacks together can allow software to bypass quite complex hardware security sub systems.
