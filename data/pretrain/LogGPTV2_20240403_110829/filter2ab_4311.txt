### Title: Black Hat EU-18: Exploiting Hardware Systems via Resonance and the Laws of Physics

**Abstract:**

Every physical object, including electronic components, has a resonant frequency. By identifying and exploiting the resonant frequencies of specific electronic sensors, programmable logic, and other devices, it is possible to subvert security measures that rely on these components. This research explores various resonance-based attacks, such as ultrasonic attacks on MEMS microphones in voice-enabled IoT and mobile devices, and high-frequency electrical resonance in programmable logic. These attacks leverage the physical properties of the target devices. When combined with other hardware vulnerabilities, they can enable software to bypass even sophisticated hardware security subsystems.

**Introduction:**

The security of many modern systems relies heavily on the integrity and robustness of their electronic components. However, these components are not immune to physical attacks, particularly those that exploit their resonant frequencies. This paper presents a detailed analysis of how resonance can be used to compromise the security of hardware systems, focusing on practical examples and potential countermeasures.

**Resonance Attacks:**

1. **Ultrasonic Attacks on MEMS Microphones:**
   - **Target:** Voice-enabled IoT and mobile devices.
   - **Method:** By generating ultrasonic signals at the resonant frequency of MEMS microphones, attackers can induce unexpected behavior or even damage the microphones, leading to potential security breaches.

2. **High-Frequency Electrical Resonance in Programmable Logic:**
   - **Target:** Devices with programmable logic, such as FPGAs and CPLDs.
   - **Method:** By applying high-frequency electrical signals at the resonant frequency of the programmable logic, attackers can cause malfunctions, data corruption, or even permanent damage, thereby bypassing security mechanisms.

**Combining Attacks:**

To achieve more significant and complex security breaches, resonance attacks can be combined with other hardware vulnerabilities. For example, an attacker might first use a resonance attack to disable a security sensor, then follow up with a traditional hardware attack to gain unauthorized access to the system. This multi-stage approach can effectively bypass even the most advanced hardware security subsystems.

**Conclusion:**

Understanding and mitigating resonance-based attacks is crucial for the security of modern electronic systems. By recognizing the physical vulnerabilities of electronic components, developers and security professionals can design more robust and resilient systems. Future work should focus on developing both hardware and software countermeasures to protect against these types of attacks.
