User: Please introduce some commonly used performance monitoring tools and their usage methods, including top, vmstat, sar, etc.
Assistant: 1. top top is a commonly used Linux system performance monitoring tool, which can monitor CPU, memory, process and other information in real time. Enter the top command in the terminal to open it, and press the number key 1 to view the usage of each core of the multi-core CPU. 2. vmstat vmstat is a command-line tool for checking virtual memory, processes, CPU, and disk I/O. It can provide real-time performance data, including CPU usage, memory usage, I/O load, etc. How to use: $ vmstat [options] Options: -a: Equivalent to -s, -m and -S all. -f : Display the number of forks, vforks and clones. -m : Display memory usage and memory details. -n : Display statistics for file IO, block IO, interrupts, and context switches. -p : Display statistics for a specified process. -s : Display operating system statistics. -d : Display disk statistics. -t : Display CPU and process information. -V : Display version information. 3. sar sar is a tool for system performance monitoring and reporting, which can monitor resources such as CPU, memory, network and disk I/O. It records system performance data and converts it into a user-friendly format for analysis and debugging. How to use: $ sar [options] [interval] [times] Options: -A : Display information of all indicators. -b : Display disk IO statistics. -c : Display CPU usage statistics. -d : Display disk IO activity statistics. -g : Display memory usage statistics. -I : Display interrupt statistics. -q : Display queue length and load balancing. -r : Display memory and swap statistics. -u : Display CPU usage statistics. -v : Display process, memory, file system, network and other statistical information.
