B-count=196–256 depending on the application context.
7 LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
The P-scale chosen in this work is only applicable to 1280× 720 HD
videos for commodity IoT cameras. Devices operating with larger
(/smaller) frame sizes should use the more (/less) intensive P-scales
to handle the privacy-video quality tradeoff at their own resolution
level. We intend to further study the other resolution cases.
Pinto is currently limited to MJPEG-format. Support for various
formats is possible with additional conversions by devices; and
by a trusted server—if such one exists—that decodes and verifies
p_videos (not the original videos) on behalf of their requesters, and
re-encodes them for video sharing. We intend to explore the use of
video sharing infrastructure for various video formats.
8 RELATED WORK
There has been extensive research on visual privacy protection or
forgery detection/prevention (video authentication), but little on
both, especially for low-end cameras.
Most prior works on visual privacy protection rely on special-
ized hardware or powerful back-end servers for processing video
streams from camera devices. Authors in [26, 31, 40, 50, 52, 54]
demonstrate high-accuracy face-detection at a frame rate of 16–30
fps (mostly on 640×480 frames) using their dedicated, custom FPGA-
based hardware. However, such robust object-detection is simply
not up to task for real-time operations in commodity devices [24]
and thus, many researchers exploit server-side processing. Respect-
ful Cameras [60] use Panasonic’s security cameras transmitting
MJPEG streams to back-end servers (3.4 GHz CPUs) for realtime
video processing. They also rely on visual markers for object track-
ing, requiring people wear colored markers such as hats or vests,
and their faces will be blurred. Cardea [61] uses Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 as client cameras, and connects them via WiFi with a server
(3.60 GHz CPU) for realtime recognition.
Vigil [69] makes an effort to partition video processing be-
tween edge computing nodes co-located with cameras and the
cloud servers via frame prioritization. While effective in realtime
monitoring—indeed, the main goal of Vigil, its frame sampling ap-
proach is not quite suitable for realtime frame-by-frame blurring.
ViewMap [46], originally designed for the privacy of users sharing
videos, is the rare case of running realtime blurring at the camera
level, but their dashcam videos are only at 5–7 fps. Pinto is an ideal
complement to ViewMap, making their dashcams produce not only
privacy-protected, but also high-frame-rate videos.
Existing forgery detection techniques aim to verify whether orig-
inal images have been altered or not. They can be roughly grouped
into two categories. The first one is the reference-based analysis
such as digital watermarking [57, 65] and fingerprinting [47, 59],
that requires prior image-processing results on original materials.
The drawback of this approach, when applied to video surveillance,
is that a watermark (/fingerprint) must be inserted (/produced)
at the time of recording, which limits this approach to specially
equipped, resourceful cameras. The second one is the post-analysis
techniques such as SVM classifier [44, 45], pixel-based [30, 34],
partition-based [66, 68], format-based [32, 49], and geometric-based
analysis [42]. While adequate for detection of image alternation in
general, their performance on post-processed, privacy-protected
videos has not been proven yet. Moreover, they do not verify the
time of recording. Note, the conventional hash-based, time-stamped
signatures upon recording will be no longer valid after post-blurring.
There exist some research efforts aimed at estimating “the time of
day” of images without timestamps [43, 48], via the sun position
by leveraging shadows in the images. While creative, they are only
applicable to outdoor, daytime videos.
9 CONCLUSION
Pinto is a video privacy solution for low-end IoT cameras. The key
insight is: (i) to perform fast, lightweight pixelation in real time
while deferring the CPU-intensive object detection until necessary
for post-processing; and (ii) to leverage pixelation for both privacy
protection and forgery prevention via the streamlined block-level
operations. We have integrated Pinto into security cam, dashcam,
and drone cam, and all successfully produce privacy-protected,
forgery-proof videos at 17–24 fps. Pinto is widely applicable to any
kinds of IoT cameras, e.g., wearable cams, sensing cams for self-
driving cars, etc. In a broader scope, our solution explores to over-
come the problem of privacy-invading, forgery-prone recordings—
the key barrier to video sharing today—while not giving up video
quality under limited device capabilities.
