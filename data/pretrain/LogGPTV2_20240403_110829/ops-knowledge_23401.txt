User: Please explain what is Load Balancing (Load Balancing), and give a practical application example.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technique for distributing workloads across multiple computing resources. It ensures high availability and scalability of the system by distributing the workload across multiple servers while increasing performance and processing power. For example, suppose a website needs to handle a large number of requests, but one server cannot handle all of them. Adding servers to the system and manually routing requests to one of them in between can result in some servers being underutilized and others being overloaded. However, by using a load balancer, requests can be automatically routed to available servers, thus averaging load and optimizing performance. Specifically, a load balancer can monitor server status and load, and dynamically route requests to configured servers. As an example, suppose an online retailer needs to process a large number of shopping cart requests and payment transactions. By using a load balancer, the retailer can route these requests across multiple servers, providing faster response times and greater reliability. When the volume of requests increases, the load balancer can automatically add more servers to handle more traffic, and when the traffic decreases, it can also automatically reduce the number of servers to save costs. This configuration improves the online retailer's performance, scalability, and availability while better meeting customer needs.
