User: How to configure virtualization technology on a Linux system to implement containerized deployment of applications and distributed systems?
Assistant: There are two main ways to configure virtualization technology on Linux systems: containerized virtualization and virtual machine virtualization. Containerized virtualization is to isolate applications and system services in containers. Each container has its own file system, network and process space, but shares the operating system kernel. Common containerization technologies include Docker, Kubernetes, LXC, etc. On the Linux system, containerized deployment of applications and distributed systems can be implemented through the following steps: 1. Install Docker or other containerized technologies: Containerized technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes can be installed through warehouses. 2. Write a container configuration file: In containerization technology, each application and service needs to write a configuration file to define the properties and dependencies of the container. 3. Build and deploy containers: use the Docker build command to build a container image, and use the Docker run command to start the container to implement containerized deployment of applications and services. Virtual machine virtualization is to isolate the entire operating system and applications in a virtual machine, and each virtual machine has its own independent operating system kernel and resources. Common virtual machine technologies include VMware, VirtualBox, etc. On the Linux system, virtual machine virtualization can be implemented through the following steps to deploy applications and distributed systems: 1. Install virtual machine software: VMware, VirtualBox and other virtual machine software can be installed through warehouses. 2. Create a virtual machine: use virtual machine software to create a virtual machine, define the properties and operating system of the virtual machine, etc. 3. Install applications and services: install applications and services in the virtual machine, and configure properties such as network and storage. 4. Start the virtual machine: use the virtual machine software to start the virtual machine to realize the virtual machine deployment of applications and services.
