## Abstract
The widespread adoption of low-cost wireless LAN (WLAN) cards and access points (APs) has led to the dense deployment of WLANs in enterprise, academic, and public spaces. In such environments, wireless clients have multiple options for affiliation, which significantly impact the quality of service (QoS) they receive. Current state-of-the-art mechanisms for AP selection typically rely on received signal strength (RSSI), associating clients with the AP that offers the strongest signal. While more sophisticated algorithms have been proposed, this work takes a step back to examine the fundamental metrics that determine end-user throughput in 802.11 networks.

We identify three key metrics: wireless channel quality, AP capacity in the presence of interference, and client contention. To measure these metrics, we modified the firmware and microcode of a commercial wireless adapter. We then conducted experiments in a real testbed to evaluate the effectiveness of each metric across various network conditions. Our results indicate that optimal user affiliation decisions should be based on metrics that reflect not only physical layer performance and network occupancy but also MAC layer behavior. Based on these insights, we propose a new cross-layer metric that is highly accurate across all tested scenarios.

## 1. Introduction/Motivation
IEEE 802.11 has become the de facto standard for wireless access in urban areas, driven by the extensive deployment of 802.11 Access Points (APs). In such dense deployments, wireless clients have multiple choices for association with the wired infrastructure. The current state-of-the-art mechanism, implemented in most 802.11 adapters, relies on received signal strength (RSSI) measurements; the client associates with the AP that provides the highest signal strength.

This approach is based on the fact that wireless adapters use rate adaptation, adjusting their transmission rates in response to the quality of the wireless link. If the link quality is poor, the client must use more robust modulation and coding schemes, reducing its effective transmission rate. Associating with an AP that offers high signal strength allows the client to communicate at higher transmission rates.

However, this method has been criticized for ignoring AP load. Focusing solely on link quality can lead to the overload of APs with high client concentrations, while other APs remain underutilized due to their slightly lower signal strengths. Consequently, new algorithms have been proposed that incorporate AP load into the selection process [4, 8]. Some of these algorithms use passive measurements from Beacon frames, while others advocate active measurements to identify the "best" AP [6].

In this work, we take a step back to examine the fundamental metrics that should drive the AP selection process to accurately reflect potential user throughput. We focus on passive measurements that can guide the selection without requiring pre-existing authentication with the APs under consideration. We identify three key aspects in AP selection:
- **AP Capacity:** Captures the capacity of an AP in the presence of interfering devices (802.11-enabled or not).
- **Duty Cycle:** Captures the average amount of time the AP spends serving all its users.
- **Link Quality:** Determines the client's instantaneous transmission rate.

We propose metrics to capture these dimensions and modify the firmware and microcode of an Intel 2915 ABG card to measure them. Using a small-scale testbed, we explore alternative network scenarios and the trade-offs different metrics may face across diverse networking environments. Our results show that using any single metric in isolation is insufficient for optimal decisions across all environments. Therefore, we propose a new cross-layer metric that effectively captures the necessary information for AP affiliation decisions.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a model for long-term 802.11 user throughput under fully saturated traffic conditions. In Section 3, we discuss alternative metrics that could guide the AP selection process and propose a way to measure them using existing hardware. In Section 4, we present our experimental methodology for assessing the accuracy of each individual metric across a diverse set of scenarios. Our results highlight the need for a cross-layer metric, which is presented in Section 5. We summarize our findings in Section 6.

## 2. User Throughput in 802.11 Networks
To derive the metrics affecting user throughput in 802.11 networks, we focus on a scenario with fully saturated wireless networks where traffic primarily flows from the AP to the users, and each user always waits for a packet. This simplifies MAC layer modeling, as only APs are senders, and the amount of interference caused by APs does not depend on the number of their users. We assume the wireless network is the bottleneck, ensuring all users achieve the same long-term throughput, as shown experimentally in [2]. Future work on relaxing these assumptions is discussed in Section 5.

Two users associated with the same AP do not generally receive the same path loss due to different distances and varying channel conditions. The 802.11 rate adaptation mechanism adjusts the encoding rate based on channel conditions; users with poorer links use lower, more robust encoding rates, occupying the medium for longer periods. A new user can estimate its instantaneous transmission rate based on RSSI using measurement-based formulas [5, 7]. Assuming data units of the same length \( S \), the data unit transmission delay for user \( u \) is given by:

\[ d(u) = \frac{S}{f(\text{SINR}(u))} \]

where \( f(\text{SINR}(u)) \) gives the instantaneous transmission rate on the channel from AP \( a \) to \( u \).

If AP \( a \) has other APs in its contention domain, its medium utilization \( M(a) \) will be less than 100%, and its actual capacity will be a fraction of the medium capacity. The long-term throughput obtained by each user \( u \) associated with AP \( a \) in a reference period \( T \) is given by:

\[ r(a, u) = \frac{1}{M(a) \cdot C(a) \cdot T} \sum_{v \in U_a} d(v) \]

where \( U_a \) is the set of users associated with AP \( a \), and \( C(a) \) denotes the capacity of AP \( a \) in data units per second (different for 802.11a/g and 802.11b networks).

Despite differences in transmission times, all users in the same cell receive the same long-term throughput, meaning each user receives the same number of data units in a reference period \( T \) [2]. The denominator of \( r(a, u) \) (identical for all users associated with the same AP) is referred to as the aggregated transmission delay (ATD) of the AP.

From this discussion, we find that the actual long-term throughput of a user in an 802.11 network depends on three factors:
1. **Effective AP Capacity:** The maximum amount of traffic the AP can serve under the best conditions in the presence of other saturated, interfering APs.
2. **Wireless Link Quality:** Determines the time a data unit occupies the medium.
3. **Average Waiting Time:** The time a user needs to wait to gain access to the medium, which depends on the number of users in the cell and the quality of the wireless link from the AP to each user.

## 3. Implementation
While some of the identified metrics can be obtained from driver-level statistics, others require low-level access to the firmware. From the previous section, we identified the following critical metrics for determining 802.11 user throughput:

### Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
RSSI is measured by the firmware upon each successful packet reception and is propagated to the driver for user affiliation decisions.

### Aggregated Transmission Delay (ATD)
ATD captures the average time an AP needs to serve one unit of information to each of its users (assuming fully saturated, downlink traffic). This information is not readily available at the driver level and requires firmware modifications. We modified the firmware to collect the time elapsed between the queuing of a packet at the MAC layer and the receipt of a MAC-level ACK for each packet transmission to each client. The MAC address of the client and the transmission delay are sent to the driver, which computes the average transmission delay and updates ATD using a weighted average filter.

### AP Capacity (APC)
AP capacity includes two metrics: nominal capacity and the fraction of time the AP gains access to the medium in the presence of other APs or non-802.11 devices. Nominal capacity can be computed from the supported physical layer, conveyed in Beacon frames (802.11a/g ≈ 30 Mbps, 802.11b ≈ 5 Mbps). The fraction of time the AP gains access to the medium requires firmware access. Every AP measures the number of slots spent in transmission/reception, backoff, and idle states. Our measurement period is defined to encounter five transmission/reception events. At the start of the period, the counters are initialized, and at the end, they are read and reset. The values are passed to the driver to estimate channel utilization (busy slots/total slots) and maintained as a weighted moving average.

The metrics requiring firmware support (ATD and APC) are AP-centric. For clients to use these metrics in their affiliation decisions, APs must propagate them to the clients via Beacon frames. We introduced additional elements in the Beacon template to carry ATD and APC values. Modified clients can decode these fields and base their affiliation decisions on the additional information.

## 4. Experimental Methodology
We deployed three APs and four clients in an office environment. Our experimental methodology involves identifying different topologies that expose the weaknesses of the three metrics when used in isolation. These topologies will also be tested using our proposed metric to demonstrate its potential in handling problematic cases. To achieve this, we selected specific locations and configurations to create diverse network conditions.
