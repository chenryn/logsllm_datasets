Could you provide some insights into what might be causing this build error? I have installed the latest version of Visual Studio Community and attempted to run the build from the Visual Studio command prompt. Below are the relevant details and the error message:

```sh
python script\build.py -c D
```

**Ninja Output:**
```sh
