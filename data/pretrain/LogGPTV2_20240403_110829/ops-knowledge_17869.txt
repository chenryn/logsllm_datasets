User: How do I write an batch file that will execute a commando "python my_program.py" from the WinPython Command Prompt? Not from the cmd.exe!
Assistant: I solved the problem by removing the path from normal python installation. I also uninstalled the normal python distribution. I also made a path to the python version in WinPython. Now I can use the normal cmd to run the program. :-)
