User: This seems to be a dumb question, but how do I ssh into the kivy-remote-shell?
I'm trying to use buildozer and seem to be able to get the application built and deployed with the command, buildozer -v android debug deploy run, which ends with the application being pushed, and displayed on my android phone, connected via USB.
However, when I try ssh -p8000 admin@127.0.0.1 from a terminal on the ubuntu machine I pushed the app from I get Connection Refused.
It seems to me that there should be a process on the host (ubuntu) machine in order to proxy the connection, or maybe I just don't see how this works?
Am I missing something simple, or do I need to dig in a debug a bit more?
Assistant: 127.0.0.1

This indicates something has gone wrong - 127.0.0.1 is a standard loopback address that simply refers to localhost, i.e. it's trying to ssh into your current computer.
If this is the ip address suggested by kivy-remote-shell then there must be some other problem, though I don't know what - does it work on another device?
