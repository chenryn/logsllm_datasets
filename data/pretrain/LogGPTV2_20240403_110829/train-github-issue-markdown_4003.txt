### Issue Description

When launching a new application created with `create-react-app` (version 4.0.3) using the `npm run start` command, I encounter a white screen and an error in the browser console. The error occurs in the `react-refresh-runtime.development.js` file at line 465, where `hook.renderers.forEach` is called, but `hook.renderers` is undefined. Instead, the `hook` object contains only an empty `_renderers` property.

### Error Details

- **Error Message:**
  ```javascript
  hook.renderers.forEach
  ```
  - `hook.renderers` is undefined.
  - The `hook` object has only an empty `_renderers` property.

- **Temporary Fix:**
  If the code is modified to `hook.renderers && hook.renderers.forEach`, the page renders correctly, and live reload functionality works as expected.

### Environment

- **React Version:** 17.0.2
- **React Refresh Version:** 0.8.3 / 00.10.0
- **Chrome Version:** 89.0.4389.114
- **Create-React-App Version:** 4.0.3

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new React application using `create-react-app` (version 4.0.3).
2 - Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the development server using `npm run start`.

**Note:** This issue can be reproduced only on my enterprise workstation. On my home PC, the development server runs without any issues.

### Current Behavior

- The application displays a white screen.
- An error is logged in the browser console: `hook.renderers.forEach` (line 465 in `react-refresh-runtime.development.js`).

### Expected Behavior

- The development server should start successfully.
- The application should render without any errors.
- Live reload functionality should work as expected.

### Additional Information

- The issue seems to be specific to the environment on my enterprise workstation.
- A temporary workaround is to modify the code to check if `hook.renderers` exists before calling `forEach` on it.
