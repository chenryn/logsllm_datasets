**Migrated issue, originally created by charles pierre (@cp2587)**
Hello,
Thanks for the fantastic job you did on this library.
I recently came across a shortcoming of the actual psycopg2 library:
apparently the executemany function is not optimized at all and just do a loop
over execute.
In regard to sqlalchemy, this mean that your recommended way of doing massive
insert/update statements is actually really slow when working with psycopg2.
For me, the difference between using execute(insert(), ..) or
bulk_insert_mappings (which in the end, just execute a tons of single INSERT
statement) and doing .insert().values() (which construct the correct INSERT
... VALUES), was like day and night.
Maybe you could add a warning or note in your documentation regarding the use
of psycopg2 in the relevant section of your docs (for instance, here,
http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/faq/performance.html#i-m-
inserting-400-000-rows-with-the-orm-and-it-s-really-slow) ?
