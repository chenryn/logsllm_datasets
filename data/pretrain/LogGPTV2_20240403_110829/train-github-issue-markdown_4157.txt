# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
It would help people who use multiple keyboards to easily setup macros without
needing third party softwares.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I want to be able to remap all the keys of more than one keyboard. Or perhaps
of all connected keyboards.
