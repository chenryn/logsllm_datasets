User: When I kick off a python script from within another python script using the subprocess module, a zombie process is created when the subprocess "completes". I am unable to kill this subprocess unless I kill my parent python process. 
Is there a way to kill the subprocess without killing the parent? I know I can do this by using wait(), but I need to run my script with no_wait().
Assistant: If you delete the subprocess object, using del to force garbage collection, that will cause the subprocess object to be deleted and then the defunct processes will go away without terminating your interpreter.  You can try this out in the python command line interface first.
