Hello.
  1. The function `silhouette_samples` of `sklearn.metrics.cluster` there are such cod rows:
    results = zip(*pairwise_distances_chunked(X, reduce_func=reduce_func,
                                                  **kwds))
    intra_clust_dists, inter_clust_dists = results
    intra_clust_dists = np.concatenate(intra_clust_dists)
    inter_clust_dists = np.concatenate(inter_clust_dists)
I've checked the work of clustering algorithms with np.concatenation and
without ones. and nothing happened. So what is the role of that
concatenations?
  2. In the beginning of function `silhouette_samples` you create an object of LabelEncoder.  
What is the reason to encode the labels after clustering algorithms, which
return the labels in form of integer numbers from -1 to inf? As I tested on
Iris dataset, the following function works well even with np.unique
     le = LabelEncoder()
     labels = le.fit_transform(labels)
     n_samples = len(labels)
     label_freqs = np.bincount(labels)
    # Alternative
    #check_number_of_labels(len(np.unique(labels)), n_samples)
      check_number_of_labels(len(le.classes_), n_samples)
Thank you!
