Commission will be generally incapable of policing these noncompliant devices.  
D.
The Commission Must Implement An Effective Enforcement Regime.  
The Commission has had a longstanding, and legally required, obligation to protect 
incumbent licensed services from interference.65  Therefore, in the unfortunate event that the 
Commission authorizes TV band devices to operate on an unlicensed basis in the band, it must 
implement an effective enforcement regime.  As discussed above, once these devices are 
released into the market the Commission will have limited power to prevent interference through 
regulatory means.  In the absence of a regulatory solution to the problems that arise after 
unlicensed devices are released into the market, the Commission must impose proper technical 
requirements.

The FNPRM, however, fails to address any means by which the Commission might 
enforce the prohibition on unlicensed devices interfering with licensed services.  At a minimum, 
the Commission should require TV band devices to be connected to the Internet and incorporate 
an automatic identification and shutoff function so that the device would cease operation if it is 
determined that it is creating interference.  Successful development of such a technological 
enforcement regime, which requires further study and development, is essential to protect the 
public’s over-the-air television service.   
V.
GIVEN THE MANY INTERFERENCE CONCERNS, AND THE LACK OF 
SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS, THE COMMISSION SHOULD 
PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY WITH PROPOSALS TO ALLOW TV BAND 
DEVICES TO SHARE THE BROADCAST SPECTRUM. 
In light of the severe interference that new TV band devices may cause to the viewing 
public, the Commission must proceed cautiously.  At a minimum, certain safeguards and limits, 
as described more fully below, must be placed on any device that is allowed to operate in the 
television spectrum.  These protections include an absolute prohibition on personal/portable 
devices, use of a robust and reliable geolocation method to keep TV band devices from operating 
in the protected contour of co-channel and adjacent-channel television stations, adoption of 
stricter out-of-band emission limits, and exclusive licensing of TV band devices.  Further 
information about these protections, and the additional work needed to achieve them, is 
described below.
At the outset, the adoption of these baseline safeguards is fully consistent with the 
Commission’s goal of providing new broadband services, especially to rural and underserved 
areas of the United States, 66 which MSTV and NAB fully support.  Notably, it is through fixed
broadband access that the Commission can further that goal; personal/portable devices will not

deliver broadband access to rural families.  If the Commission’s proposal to allow TV band 
devices to operate in the spectrum is truly about solving the broadband problem in America, 
especially for rural areas, the Commission will be able to accomplish this goal by authorizing the 
operation of fixed devices while fully protecting the American public’s over-the-air television 
service.
A.
By Authorizing Only Fixed TV Band Devices To Operate, Accompanied By 
Proper Protections, The Commission Can Promote A Broadband Plan 
Without Endangering Television Reception.  
  MSTV and NAB understand that IEEE 802.22 will propose a fixed operation approach 
that incorporates key protections aimed at preventing the four types of interference discussed 
above in Section III.  As a general matter, MSTV and NAB urge the Commission to formulate 
rules implementing IEEE 802.22’s plan for fixed devices.   
These protections should include a prohibition on the operation of devices within the 
contour of both co- and first adjacent channels.  Such a prohibition can only be achieved through 
a rigorous combination of geolocation (using GPS), professional installation of the fixed TV 
band devices, and frequency sensing (which is utilized as an added, and not the sole protection, 
and which also would help prevent interference with cordless microphones).67  To implement 
geolocation, the Commission must require fixed devices to utilize outdoor antennas, given that 
GPS is not reliable indoors.
Additional research and testing will be necessary to implement a geo-location protection 
system.  Importantly, the key to geo-location is access to a reliable database.  Thus, a correct, 
post-transition database will be necessary for all stations, including LPTV, translators and cable 
67 The current IEEE 802.22 approach specifically provides that the suggested -116 dBm sensing 
level assumes that there is no operation within both a television station’s co- and adjacent 
channel, which is assured not through sensing, but through geo-location and professional 
installation.

head ends.  While the Commission has proposed a final DTV Table, that table will continue to be 
revised up until the transition to DTV.  Of course, there will also be ongoing changes in station 
parameters once the transition is complete, necessitating a means of keeping the database up to 
date.  Moreover, the transition for Class A, LPTV and TV translator stations will not be 
completed by February 18, 2009.  Accordingly, there may be considerable movement in channel 
use for several years after the transition and devices will have to protect both analog and digital 
operations of Class A, LPTV and TV translator operations during this period.  As also discussed 
in Section III, proper out-of-band emission limits will need to be determined and adopted; the 
Part 15.209 emission limits are ineffective at preventing interference.
B.
Personal/Portable Devices Are Not Compatible With Existing Operations In 
The Broadcast Spectrum. 
The Commission’s decision in this proceeding to permit only fixed low power devices to 
operate in the broadcast spectrum was certainly the proper course of action.68  Personal/portable 
devices, defined as devices that operate independently of a base station, such as mesh networks, 
WiFi cards, etc, are extremely problematic and should not be allowed to operate in the television 
band because the Commission will be unable to ensure that harmful interference to licensed 
services does not occur.
Simply put, no method exists today (or in the foreseeable future) to prevent interference 
from personal/portable devices to consumers’ reception of DTV services.  For example, IEEE 
802 has not conducted any studies on this issue, as it was beyond the scope of the Project 
Authorization Request which created the IEEE 802.22 Working Group, nor has any other IEEE 
802 working group examined this issue.  Therefore, there are currently no suggested rules for 
how portable/personal devices would be able to operate without causing harmful interference.

As discussed above in Section III, MSTV’s study showed there was significant co- and 
adjacent channel interference from personal/portable devices operating at 100 mW.69  Sensing 
alone will be ineffective, as demonstrated, to prevent any devices (fixed or personal/portable) 
from operating within the protected contour of a co- or adjacent channel.  But because of the 
limitations of GPS, the geolocation method proposed to keep fixed devices from operating within 
a station’s co- or adjacent channel’s contour does not work on indoor consumer devices. Once 
such operation occurs, it could prevent reception of DTV signals for miles.  Out-of-band 
emissions would also have a serious effect on reception, as the personal/portable devices would 
often operate in very close proximity to consumers’ television sets, in comparison to the outdoor 
operation of fixed devices.
Moreover, the enforcement problems described in Section IV would be particularly acute 
in the context of personal/portable devices.  Wide diffusion of such devices is to be expected; 
just as today 2.4 GHz unlicensed devices can be found in many homes, personal/portable TV 
band devices could proliferate throughout neighborhoods and businesses.  Unlike fixed devices, 
which would be professionally installed, there can be no reliable means of knowing where a 
personal/portable device ends up once it is sold to a consumer.  The inability of the Commission 
to effectively oversee the proliferation of personal/portable devices will create greater economic 
incentives for manufacturers to make products that exceed the Commission’s requirements, as 
occurred in the satellite radio space.  Similarly, the abovementioned problems with aftermarket 
products designed to boost power will be even more profound.     
In light of the unique and currently insurmountable challenges posed by the introduction 
of personal/portable devices into the broadcast spectrum, the Commission should not authorize 
69 See Exhibit A.

any such devices at this time.  Risking the public’s new digital television service to promote 
these devices would be particularly inappropriate given their lack of connection to the goal of 
improved broadband access, which can be achieved through careful introduction of fixed devices.
C.
Only Exclusively Licensed TV Band Devices Should Be Allowed To Operate In 
The Broadcast Spectrum.   
MSTV and NAB appreciate the Commission’s willingness to consider the relative 
benefits of licensed uses of any “white spaces” that may exist.70  The Commission has correctly 
recognized that an unlicensed system is not the only possible way to authorize spectrum sharing 
in the television spectrum.  In fact, as discussed below, a licensed white space regime would 
carry numerous public interest benefits – accountability, efficiency, and public remuneration – 
that would be lost forever by an unlicensed devices regime.  Depriving the public of the benefit 
of new, licensed spectrum is even more inappropriate given the large swaths of unlicensed 
spectrum that the Commission has made available on an unlicensed basis in recent years.
First, a licensed system would address one of the biggest problems with an unlicensed 
system: accountability.  That is, if a device operating in licensed “white space” were to interfere 
with the public’s access to free, over-the-air television, the licensee responsible for the spectrum 
used by that device could be identified and made accountable for remedying the problem.  
Assuming that some TV band devices will be allowed to operate within the broadcast spectrum, 
the only effective way to ensure that incumbent services will be protected is through a licensing 
system.          
Second, a licensed system will also most efficiently make use of any available “white 
spaces” that may exist.  Unlike an unlicensed regime, in which there is no mechanism to control 
the number of devices that operate simultaneously and the resulting “noise” from such operation, 
70 See First R&O and FNPRM at ¶¶ 26-32. 
Comments of MSTV and NAB 
Jan. 31, 2007 
ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186 
Page 37 of 40 
a licensed user has incentive to decrease noise so that the noise floor of the spectrum does not 
rise to harmful levels and thereby prevent the licensee’s full exploitation of the “white spaces” 
spectrum.  In contrast, in an unlicensed regime, manufacturers have incentive to maximize their 
use of the spectrum without concern to the aggregate effect on the white space at issue.  This 
incentive results in a “tragedy of the commons” whereby noise from multiple unlicensed devices 
transmitting in the same spectrum with inefficient technology eventually degrades the ability of 
all users to benefit from the spectrum.71  In licensed “white space,” the same entity would 
control the spectrum used by television services and the TV band devices, and would 
consequently design all devices to operate using non-interfering technology.
Third, a licensed system benefits the economy and American taxpayers more effectively 
than an unlicensed system.  With the adoption of Section 309(j) of the Communications Act, 
Congress made clear its intent that the Commission should auction new licenses for commercial 
use of the spectrum.  Therefore, if TV band devices were to operate on a licensed basis, the 
Commission would auction licenses and receive revenues from the proceeds of the auction.  In 
designing a system to auction new licenses for commercial use, Congress has asked the 
Commission to keep in mind, among others, the goals of “promoting economic opportunity” and 
“recovery for the public of a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available 
for commercials use and avoidance of unjust enrichment through the methods employed to 
award uses of that resource.”72
71 On the unlicensed side, experience in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band is instructive.  There, 
cordless phones have “reap[ed] devastating effects on 802.11b WLANs” because the 
technologies used are not compatible for minimization of interference.  See Interference from 
Cordless Phones, Wi-Fi Planet, April 15, 2003, available at http://www.wi-

The recent Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) spectrum, which grossed $13.9 billion, 
speaks to the public benefits of licensing.73  Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office has 
estimated that auction of television channels 52 through 69 will raise at least $10 billion74;
auctioning of “white spaces” in channels 2 through 51 could produce similar results.  These 
additional amounts would be lost, however, if the Commission chooses to allow TV band 
devices to operate in the broadcast spectrum on an unlicensed basis.  These benefits to the 
economy and American taxpayers, lend further support to MSTV’s position that licensing the 
television “white spaces,” is the proper course of action.
Finally, the Commission should not allow unlicensed operation in the television band, 
and risk interference with licensed services, because the Commission has already provided 
adequate spectrum for the use of unlicensed devices.  Within the so-called “beachfront” spectrum 
below 3 GHz, the Commission has already allocated over 100 MHz of spectrum to unlicensed 
uses.  In addition, at the urging of unlicensed device manufacturers, the Commission in late 2003 
expanded the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (“U-NII”) band, which already had 
a 300 MHz-wide unlicensed allocation, by 255 MHz of spectrum. As a result, unlicensed devices 
in the U-NII spectrum have access to 555 MHz of spectrum.75    The Commission rightly

FCC (rel. Sep. 18, 2006).
74 See Congressional Budget Office, Cost Estimate, Reconciliation Recommendations of the 
House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 12 (Oct. 31, 2005).   
75 Unlicensed devices may now operate in the following 5 GHz-band frequencies: 5.150-5.250 
GHz, 5.250-5.350, 5.470-5.825.  Thus, in the U-NII band alone, unlicensed devices have access 
to nearly twice the amount of spectrum that will be allocated to the public’s free, over-the-air 
television service after the digital transition is complete.

Page 39 of 40 
characterized its decision to expand the U-NII band as “a significant increase in the spectrum 
available for unlicensed devices across the overall radio spectrum.”76   
Indeed, proponents of unlicensed devices appear to offer inconsistent rationales.  The 
argument for using TV spectrum is that it has superior propagation characteristics.  This would 
support using spectrum for unlicensed services, such as rural broadband, which can harness 
efficiencies of wide areas.  In this regard, IEEE 802.22 has offered a fixed service approach to 
meet this need.  However, the advantages of greater coverage are not needed for most personal 
and portable devices.  For example, in-home wireless networking can utilize spectrum above 1 
GHz to cover the short ranges typically needed for most home wireless network systems.  In fact, 
such frequencies will be more efficient since they allow for greater frequency reuse.  Thus the 
justification for using the TV band - greater propagation - seems to be lacking as applied to many 
personal and portable devices.  Consequently, other bands, which do not have the risk of 
interference, would appear to be more appropriate.    
In light of the overabundance of underutilized unlicensed spectrum, the Commission has 
no cause – even if it had the authority – to allow unlicensed devices to interfere with licensed 
services.  Sufficient spectrum is available for new unlicensed services; the Commission need not 
put the public’s licensed radiocommunications infrastructure at risk.  The “white spaces” that 
exist in less densely populated areas should instead be auctioned on an exclusively licensed 
basis.

CONCLUSION 
No less than the future of the public’s television service is at stake in this 
proceeding.  Accordingly, MSTV and NAB respectfully urge the Commission to adopt the 
above-described protections before authorizing any new devices in the broadcast spectrum.

Analysis of Various Interference Mechanisms 
Affecting Television Reception from TV Band Devices
By Robert Eckert1
Introduction 
This engineering statement has been prepared on behalf of the Association for Maximum Service 
Television (“MSTV”) as part of its comments in response to the Commission’s First Report and 
Order and Notice of Further Proposed Rulemaking (Docket 04-168) on Unlicensed Operation in 
the TV Broadcast Bands.  Specifically, this statement addresses the types of interference that 
should be considered when developing technical rules to protect the existing licensed service 
from interference.  The statement also provides a methodology to calculate interference and 
establishes minimum separation distances needed to protect TV reception from interference.  The 
statement also finds that unlicensed devices in the TV bands, particularly personal/portable 
devices that are uncontrolled and can be located and operated anywhere, pose a significantly 
greater threat of interference to TV viewers. The statement also briefly describes the difficulty of 
co-channel sensing within a DTV station’s contour.   
I. 
Types of Interference 
Interference to DTV reception can occur due to a number of different mechanisms.  “TV band 
devices” and Part 15 unlicensed devices can not cause interference and must protect all TV 
operations against a number of different types of interference.  Specifically, there are four basic 
types of interference such devices can cause to DTV receivers.  They are: (1) co-channel 
interference; (2) adjacent channel interference; (3) out-of-band interference; and, (4) interference 
1 Robert Eckert is a recognized expert in the areas of propagation, radio communications and interference 
analysis.  He has served as the Chief of the Technical Analysis Branch of the FCC’s Office of Engineering 
and Technology and has done significant work in the area of digital television including the development of 
the FCC’s DTV Table of Allotments.   
from taboo channels and unwanted intermodulation products. A brief description of these various 
interference mechanisms and how they relate to TV band or unlicensed device operation are 
described below:
a.  Co-channel Interference Considerations 
Co-channel interference in the context of the DTV service comes from distant undesired signals 
of the same 6 MHz bandwidth as that of the desired signal.  In the case of TV band devices, the 
Commission did not explicitly state in the instant rule making proceeding that the TV band or 
unlicensed device bandwidths would match that of the DTV service.  However, it appears likely 
that unlicensed TV band devices will tend to use channels of about the same 6 MHz width as 
DTV and in a corresponding sequence.2  It also appears that these devices will employ 
modulation techniques producing the same relatively flat and noise-like spectrum signature 
emitted by DTV transmitters.  To the extent that emissions are similar, much of the testing and 
analysis that have generated protection requirements in the DTV service can be applied to 
determine requirements for low power TV band device or unlicensed operation.3  In particular, 
after some prototype TV band devices become available and are tested, it may be found that the 
2 In the event the unlicensed device bandwidth is different than that of the DTV service or if the channels 
used by these devices do not coincide with those of the TV channels, the protection requirements included 
in FCC rules for the DTV service may have to be extended to include new desired to undesired (D/U) ratios 
for such operation.  
3 The DTV service was set up after comprehensive testing of prototype receivers to determine their 
robustness in the presence of various types of interference.  Testing provided a quantitative measure of 
robustness as the ratio between desired and undesired signals at the point where degradation was first 
visible, the threshold of visibility.  These ratios are incorporated in FCC rules in the particular cases of co-
channel and adjacent channel interference, and further information is available in laboratory records of the 
testing effort.  Though essential for establishing rules that might be established to govern manufacture and 
operation of unlicensed devices in the TV bands, these data may not be sufficient.  This is due in part to the 
fact that the receivers tested were high quality prototypes and also because the tests did not include all 
types of interference that could be caused by unlicensed devices. 
2
desired-to-undesired signal ratio adequate for co-channel DTV operation applies equally to DTV 
reception in the presence of co-channel signals from unlicensed or TV band devices. 4
b. Adjacent Channel Interference Considerations 
Adjacent channel interference poses a special problem for use of unlicensed devices in the TV 
bands.  Just as in the DTV service, adjacent channel interference would come from undesired 
signals of equal bandwidth either immediately above or below the desired signal in frequency.    
In the case of operation of adjacent channels in the DTV service, the FCC established a DTV 
Table of Allotments that authorized adjacent channel operations at specific locations chosen to 
minimize interference throughout DTV stations’ service areas.  Such a methodology cannot be 
applied to TV band device or unlicensed device operation, where the location of such devices can 
not be precisely controlled.  Calculations show that unlicensed transmitters or TV band devices of 
only 100 mW can produce a field strong enough to interfere with adjacent channel DTV receivers 
at 30 meters and beyond.5  Therefore, the only safe approach is to preclude unlicensed devices 
from operating in adjacent channel DTV service areas.  This means the “white space” for any 
particular channel excludes areas of adjacent channel DTV service as well as co-channel service 
areas.  Allowance must be made for the possibility that the device is being used at a point where 
the signal of an active DTV station on an adjacent channel is weak.  This weak signal condition is 
expected near the edge of DTV service areas but may also occur well inside due to shadowing.  
Consequently, the proposed Part 15 rules for unlicensed rules must define an available channel as 
4 As noted above, some additional testing should be carried out to ensure that the DTV D/U ratios apply to 
TV band devices that employ different modulation techniques.  Alternatively, it would be appropriate to 
include some additional margin to take into account differences between DTV ATSC signals and other 
signal modulations such as COFDM or QPSK that may be used by these TV band devices. 
5 In weak DTV signal situations this distance can be hundreds of meters.  See the Table of Distances to 
Various Field Strengths, in Section II-a of this paper.  Also see MSTV/NAB comments for calculation of 
adjacent channel interference distances. 
3
one distant from both co- and adjacent channel of a DTV station, i.e., outside the TV station’s 
contour by some appropriate distance.6
c.  Out-of Band Emission Interference Considerations
Emissions adjacent to each side of the operating 6 MHz channel are not ordinary out-of-band 
emissions to be treated as haphazard unintentional radiation.  Instead, the rules in Section 15.209 
must explicitly recognize the limited (120 kHz) bandwidth of CISPR quasi-peak measurements of 
out-of-band emissions.  Supposing that the CISPR measurement is reasonably accurate in 
determining the power of noise-like signals in 120 kHz, the total power in a flat noise-like signal 
of 6 MHz is 17 dB greater, and that is a key parameter in determining the potential for out-of 
band channel interference.7  Measurement procedures by whatever means should obtain all the 
significant data that could be obtained using a spectrum analyzer. 
In addition, the total power in a wide range of frequencies in the vicinity of a consumer’s TV 
reception system will generally increase the noise level, affecting channels beyond the first 
adjacency.  This is particularly applicable to situations involving many unlicensed transmitters, 
especially in view of the envisioned popularity of the personal/portable TV band devices being 
proposed.  By itself, this factor could wipe out DTV service on channels that might otherwise be 
considered unaffected.  The possibilities for apparent noise power accumulation over many 
frequencies from many locations should be considered in revising the rules for out-of band 
emissions in Section 15.209.  Limits should be established so that the results of allowing 
6 The required separation distances are calculated later in this paper. 
7 The effects of operation on an adjacent channel are two-fold: First, receivers are unavoidably sensitive to 
power that may be present in the adjacent frequency space; and second, a modulated signal in the adjacent 
channel will inevitably spill some power into the desired channel. The second of these effects is measurable 
with a spectrum analyzer, while the combined effect of the two factors is measured in terms of the desired-
to-undesired signal ratio at which the DTV picture is lost. 
4
unlicensed devises in the TV bands can be monitored in terms of the number and location of 
devices.
d.  Intermodulation Interference Considerations 
Interference potentially harmful to DTV reception can also arise due to intermodulation between
various signals, weak and strong both within and outside the desired DTV channel, that may be 
presented to DTV receivers.  Interference of this type occurs in the receiver itself, and is more 
likely in DTV receivers sold today than in the high quality prototype DTV receivers used to 
develop the DTV planning factors.  For example, an image of an otherwise ignorable first-, 
second-, or third-adjacent DTV channel can be made to fall on the desired signal by 
intermodulation with narrow band spurious emissions by unlicensed devices. While 
intermodulation is almost certainly present in real situations, the effects on DTV receivers have 
not been tested in a way that could lead to quantitative criteria for interference protection.8  Some 
new information in this regard is available from recent tests conducted by the CRC and additional 
information may become available because the Commission has directed its laboratory to test 
contemporary DTV receivers with interfering signals from second- and third-adjacent channels 
and beyond.9  These projects offer a good opportunity for an investigation that might at least set 
some bounds on the degree of desensitization that can be caused by intermodulation in real 
situations.  Such real situations involving DTV transmissions alone exist today.  If it is found 
likely that appreciable interference is created by this mechanism, it will be necessary to design 
special restrictions on the use of unlicensed devices to eliminate this type of interference. 
8 The early comprehensive testing, upon which FCC rules for DTV service are based, examined co-channel 
interference, adjacent channel interference, man-made noise, and narrow-band emissions of the kind 
produced by land mobile transmitters. The interference sources for co-channel testing were DTV emissions 
confined to 6 MHz.  The sources for adjacent channel testing were similar DTV emissions confined to the 6 
MHz exactly neighboring the desired channel below and, separately, above in frequency.  Thus there is a 
lack of data for conclusively determining the effects of emissions outside of first-adjacent DTV channels 
and of their effects when combined with first-adjacent channels themselves.
9 At the request of MSTV, The CRC laboratory has recently conducted such tests.

II. 
White Space and Protection Ratios 
Assuming that the transmissions of unlicensed TV band devices will have a spectrum signature 
very much like that of DTV, many of the quantitative criteria used for the mutual protection of 
DTV stations can be applied to the introduction of unlicensed devices.  These quantitative criteria 
are found in the subpart of FCC Rules governing Television Broadcast Stations.10  The rules in 
that subpart place limitations on transmitting facilities and specify the locations where specific 
channels are assigned or available.  Similar rules of a quantitative nature must be created for 
unlicensed devices if they are allowed in TV bands.  This entails defining boundaries of the 
“white space” available for use of specific channels and the technical characteristics of devices 
that will be allowed on such channels. 
To get a clear idea of how unlicensed devices may be used, it is helpful to analyze the process of 
determining white space. A determination based on the protection ratios established in FCC Rules 
at §73.623(c) will tend to make unlicensed use conform to the protection rules already established 
for the DTV service itself.  There are two elements to this determination: first the service 
contours of individual stations, and second the distance that must be maintained between 
unlicensed devices and TV receivers that may be located on the service contour. 
Assuming that TV band devices are allowed to operate wherever they do not cause interference 
with either co-channel or adjacent channel TV service (as stated previously, operation of such TV 
band devices is not feasible within the co-channel or adjacent channel TV service area), the 
following procedure is necessary to determine whether a particular channel is available at a 
particular geographical point.  Presumably the determination would be made with computer 
assistance.  A table is prepared of the separation distances between the point of interest and the

service contour of every co-channel and adjacent channel DTV station.11,12  The smallest of these 
distances is examined, separately, for each of the adjacent channels and for the candidate 
unlicensed device channel.  All three of these distances must of course be positive; that is, the 
point of interest must lie outside all service contours of any of the three channel types, co-
channel, lower adjacent and upper adjacent.13,14 Finally, protection ratios and power limitations 
imposed on unlicensed devices determine whether the device is far enough from TV receivers 
that may be located on these service contours.  It is not enough, for example, that the candidate 
unlicensed device channel is assigned to serve Baltimore or Annapolis when proposing use of 
unlicensed operation in Washington, DC.  The possibility of an error of this kind indicates the 
importance of establishing rigorous procedures for creating channel availability tables for 
unlicensed devises. 
To align with the rules governing DTV service, minimum distances to service contours should be 
determined by reference to the D/U ratios of §73.623(c).15  These D/U ratios are –28 dB and –26 
11 The service contour is the outer boundary of the area in which the predicted F(50, 90) field strength is the 
value given in § 73.622(e).  For the UHF band the value is 41 dBu.  This value may be subject to a 
modification by what is called the “dipole factor” dependent upon the specific UHF channel of interest.  
Whether to apply this modification is a detail that must be addressed by FCC rules for unlicensed devices.  
The F(50, 90) field is predicted based on TV transmitter power, antenna height and horizontal antenna gain 
pattern. 
12 Note that it must be decided whether the database from which the table is prepared will contain 
engineering parameters of stations as currently licensed or maximum facility parameters.  
13 Note that more than just one upper and one lower adjacent channel service area may be near a particular 
point of interest.  The situation can be quite complicated in urban areas. 
14 Some proponents of unlicensed TV band devices will argue for ignoring possibilities for interference on 
adjacent channels despite computations showing that interference of this kind can occur at significant 
distances, e.g. beyond 30 meters for a 100 mW device, and beyond a kilometer in the case of a 1 watt 
device. 
15 It is intended that the desired (D) and undesired (U) signals be evaluated as received through directional 
receiving antennas, and therefore authorization of unlicensed devices requires a model of the orientation of 
receiving antennas.  Planning factors for the DTV service lead to a determination that the field of 41 dBu in 
the receiver’s neighborhood is adequate for reception provided that the receiving antenna has a forward 
gain of 10 dB.  It is assumed that the receiving antenna in fact achieves this gain by being pointed at the 
7
dB respectively for interference from lower and upper adjacent channels.  In the case of the lower 
adjacent channel, for example, this means that interference is considered to occur at the service 
contour when the undesired signal is more than 28 dB stronger than 41 dBu.  Note that these 
considerations involve a considerable degree of precision, attainable for operation of unlicensed 
devices at fixed locations, but requiring an extra margin of decibels in case sensing alone is relied 
upon by smart devices. 
The criteria for co-channel operation are different in nature because any small co-channel signal 
power will overwhelm receivers located at the service contour.  In the DTV service and 
interference model on which §73.623(c) is based, co-channel emissions of almost any magnitude 
raise the noise level sensed by receivers at the service contour to a value exceeding the minimum 
signal-to-noise requirement.  The DTV picture will abruptly at that point be lost.16 Therefore 
unlicensed devices operating co-channel must be completely out of range, and the out-of-range 
distance should be conservatively chosen to prevent interference possibilities. 
a.  Required Separation Beyond Service Contours 
Consider the following situation.  An unlicensed TV band device is at a geographical point 
determined to be outside the noise-limited service contour of a particular DTV station.  The 
device must also be so far out of range that its co-channel emission does not increase the apparent 
receiver noise level.  Refer to the table of distances to various field strengths, below.  According 
to the table, to keep the free space interference field 20 dB below the desired DTV signal would 
require a separation of 600 miles even though 20 dB is nowhere near enough.  It is obvious that 
desired station.  However, it cannot be safely assumed that undesired signals from unlicensed devices 
would reach receiving antennas from a low gain direction.  
16 Section §73.623(c) sets the level at which this happens at 23 dB below the desired 41 dBu signal.  This is 
a noise level 7 dB weaker than the level in the absence of interference and is deemed ignorable.

obstacles on the horizon would normally provide an effective shield, and a lesser distance will be 
adequate.  Radio propagation models like those used to calculate contour distances could be used.  
However, those models involve statistical concepts such as percentage of location and time, are 
not well supported by data except at confidence limits near 50%, and are inappropriate in the 
present application where confidence approaching 100% is needed.  A practical separation 
requirement must nevertheless be established, and it makes good sense to base this on line-of-
sight considerations.  The line-of-sight distance between antennas both at rooftop height is about 
15 miles, and the distance from a hand-held device to a rooftop antenna is about 10 miles.17
Assuming that the device is 15 miles outside all co-channel DTV service contours, a further 
check must be made to protect adjacent channel DTV. FCC rules at §73.623(c) indicate that DTV 
stations are protecting one another’s service provided that adjacent channel fields are less than 67 
dBu and 69 dBu respectively for interference from lower and upper adjacent channels.18  From 
the table of distances to various field strengths, it is found that this level of protection will be 
achieved by requiring that 4 Watt EIRP devices stay at least 3 miles from the contour of an 
adjacent channel TV station. 
17  These values are the respective sums of the distances from the common horizon. 
18 The 69 dBu number comes from adding 28 dB to the field of 41 dBu that defines noise-limited contours. 
Similarly, 67 dBu is the sum of 41 dBu and the 26 dB required for upper adjacent protection.

b.  Calculating Interference 
The table below describes a procedure for calculating the interfering power that would be 
produced by RF sources in the TV bands.  The effects indicated in steps 5, 6 and 7 assume that 
the interference power is noise-like with an approximately flat spectrum over 6 MHz. 
Note that interference fields produced by 4 W or 4000 mW sources are very great.  One 
consequence of this is that such sources must be located well outside the service contours of both 
co-channel and adjacent channel DTV stations. 
Also note that even though a device may be outside co- and adjacent channel contours, it will 
almost certainly be inside the contour of one or more DTV stations, specifically those using 
channels removed by 12 or more MHz.  Inside DTV service contours the directionality of TV
