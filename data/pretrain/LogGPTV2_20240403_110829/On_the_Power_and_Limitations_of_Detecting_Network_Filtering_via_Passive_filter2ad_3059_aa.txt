Abstract. Network operators often apply policy-based traﬃc ﬁltering
at the egress of edge networks. These policies can be detected by per-
forming active measurements; however, doing so involves instrumenting
every network one wishes to study. We investigate a methodology for
detecting policy-based service-level traﬃc ﬁltering from passive observa-
tion of traﬃc markers within darknets. Such markers represent traﬃc we
expect to arrive and, therefore, whose absence is suggestive of network
ﬁltering. We study the approach with data from ﬁve large darknets over
the course of one week. While we show the approach has utility to expose
ﬁltering in some cases, there are also limits to the methodology.
1 Introduction
In this paper we develop a methodology for broadly understanding policy-based
network ﬁltering across the Internet. We begin with three observations from
previous work:
Policy-based Filtering Happens: We understand from experience and anec-
dote that network operators apply policy-based ﬁlters to traﬃc leaving their
networks. These ﬁlters are used for myriad reasons, including (i) because par-
ticular traﬃc types are not meant to traverse wide-area networks (e.g., internal
ﬁle sharing), (ii) to prevent services from being leveraged by external devices
(e.g., using an internal mail server as an open relay), (iii) to funnel all user traﬃc
through some proxy (e.g., to implement capacity-saving caching or content-based
ﬁltering) and (iv) to prevent propagation of malware. The community has previ-
ously taken modest steps to empirically understand such ﬁltering. For instance,
the Netalyzr [12] tool determines whether 25 popular services are blocked or not
via active probing from within the network under study.
Missing Traﬃc Illuminates Network Behavior: Previous research shows
that we can detect broad network outages by monitoring dark address space for
the curious absence of traﬃc. In other words, when a large darknet suddenly
receives no background radiation from a previously active network, we can con-
clude there is a change in policy. This has been studied in the context of both

political events [10] which cause authorities to sever ties with the Internet, as
well as natural disasters [3] which have the same impact on network traﬃc, even
if these do not share the goal of policies that thwart communication of political
adversaries.
Malware is Ubiquitous: A wealth of compromised devices on edge networks
try to indiscriminately propagate using a set of vulnerabilities that span services
[1,18].
We believe the above suggests we can leverage the ubiquity of background
radiation to form an expectation that speciﬁc marker traﬃc should arrive from
a given origin network. When the expectation fails to hold, we are left with the
strong suggestion of a policy-based ﬁlter hindering the speciﬁc kind of traﬃc in
a given origin network. As a concrete exemplar, we study this technique in the
context of over 96 billion Conﬁcker packets that arrive at our darknet to form
a broad understanding of TCP port 445 ﬁltering in origin networks across the
Internet.
By studying one week of traﬃc arriving at ﬁve /8 darknets—roughly 2.25 %
of the IPv4 address space—we ﬁnd evidence that both supports and refutes our
hypothesis. We ﬁnd that in the case of Conﬁcker—a large malware outbreak—
detecting silence from a given origin network for a given kind of traﬃc does in
fact allow us to understand the policy ﬁlters in place across the Internet. On
the other hand, while we observe much malware in our datasets, we ﬁnd each
speciﬁc kind of traﬃc rarely spans enough of the origin networks to broadly
develop an expectation that the given traﬃc should be present and thus develop
conclusions based on the absence of such traﬃc. Therefore, we also learn that
searching for silence in darknet traﬃc is limited to only signiﬁcant events—i.e.,
full outages or large malware outbreaks. However, even with the limitations, we
will show that the general approach does increase our broad understanding of
policy-based traﬃc ﬁltering.
2 Related Work
We leverage a number of technologies and techniques that have been developed
by the community, including observing background radiation (e.g., [14,18]), and
using darknets as an observatory (e.g., [2]). None of this previous work addresses
the topic of inferring service-level network policy via passive observation, which
we tackle in this paper.
Meanwhile, studying policy-based network ﬁltering of various kinds has pre-
viously been conducted via active measurements from the edge network under
study (e.g., [4,5,8,12]). The policies the previous work addresses are myriad—
from the impact of bogon ﬁltering to the ability to spoof packets to service-level
policies. The wealth of work illustrates the interest in this topic. Our goals are
similar to some of this previous work; however, our approach is to leverage
passive measurements to understand the Internet broadly without the need to
instrument every edge network, which is at best a large logistical undertaking.

The closest work to ours is in using the lack of background radiation from
a given network to detect large scale outages that stem from natural disasters
[3] or political events [10]. Our work shares their general notion that a lack of
background radiation destined to a darknet can illuminate events within the
network. We take this notion a step further and detect service-level policies
applied to network traﬃc.
3 Data Collection
We use two primary sources of data for this study. The ﬁrst dataset is a list
of known Conﬁcker infected hosts obtained via the Conﬁcker domain sinkhole
[13]. The Conﬁcker worm [15] has been plaguing the Internet since 2008 and,
six years later, continues to be the top globally-detected worm in the ﬁrst half
of 2014 [11]. It propagates via several vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows, as
well as via dictionary attacks on passwords. Propagation via the network vector
involves scanning random IPs on TCP port 445 [6]. A ﬂaw in the random num-
ber generator results in Conﬁcker only targeting IP addresses with both second
and fourth octets less than 128, which eﬀectively excludes more than three-
quarters of addresses from ever being scanned [16]. One of the main ways that
Conﬁcker has been disabled by researchers is to pre-emptively determine and reg-
ister botnet-related domain names—which are generated algorithmically—that
the malware uses for command and control. Subsequently, by observing com-
munication to these domains, we are able to discover IP addresses of Conﬁcker-
infected hosts [13]. The list of infected IP addresses we use in this study was
collected at the same time as our darknet data (described below) and contains
17.5M Conﬁcker infected hosts from 1.6M/24 networks.
The second dataset is a set of packet traces of traﬃc arriving at ﬁve unallocated
IPv4 darknets: 23.0.0.0/8, 37.0.0.0/8, 45.0.0.0/8, 100.0.0.0/8, and 105.0.0.0/8. We
obtained permission from the Regional Internet Registrars (RIRs) to simultane-
ously announce these network blocks for one week, January 14–20, 2011. We val-
idated that our routes for these preﬁxes were globally visible to the majority of
Route Views’ [17] 121 peers during the week of our data collection. In aggregate,
our darknet observes traﬃc to nearly 84M IPv4 addresses or roughly 2.25 % of
the usable IPv4 address space. While using darknets is a well-known technique
(e.g., [18]), to our knowledge, this is the largest simultaneous IPv4 darknet collec-
tion to date.
In total, our darknet data comprises roughly 96.1B packets from 4.1M/24
address blocks in the Internet. Table 1 gives a broad characterization of our
darknet data. Due to the lack of two-way traﬃc, we are unable to directly esti-
mate how much measurement-based packet loss impacts our dataset. However,
we have previously used the monitor to capture traﬃc at 1 Gbps without signiﬁ-
cant loss and the average rate of the darknet data is less than 98 Mbps. Therefore,
we do not believe the amount of traﬃc our monitor failed to collect rises to the
point of impacting our high-order conclusions.
Next, we classify the darknet data into ﬁve categories: (i) Conﬁcker traf-
ﬁc represents TCP SYNs to port 445 from a known Conﬁcker-infected host;

(ii) Likely Conﬁcker traﬃc includes TCP SYNs to port 445 from hosts not on
the Conﬁcker-infected host list but to an IP address that Conﬁcker is known to
target; (iii) Scanning traﬃc represents TCP SYNs that could not be produced
by Conﬁcker processes; (iv) Backscatter traﬃc represents SYN+ACK packets
that are likely the result of SYNs spoofed to be from our darknet; and (v) Other
traﬃc, which includes all traﬃc not falling into one of the other categories.
Figure 1 shows the breakdown of the traﬃc captured to each /8 we monitor.
We note that the amount of Conﬁcker traﬃc is relatively uniform across the /8
blocks we monitor.

A ﬁnal caveat is that we cannot verify the source addresses in packets arriving
at our monitor. We know spooﬁng is both possible and likely present—e.g.,
see the amount of backscatter in Fig. 1 as an indication of the prevalence of
spooﬁng. Therefore, in the remainder of the paper we take care to include this
ambiguousness in our interpretation of the results.

As we discuss in Sect. 1, our hypothesis is that we can use the background
radiation from malware to infer ﬁltering policies across the Internet. In this
