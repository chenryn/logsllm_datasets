## Abstract
Network operators often implement policy-based traffic filtering at the egress points of edge networks. These policies can be detected through active measurements, but such methods require instrumentation across all networks of interest. This paper explores a methodology for detecting policy-based service-level traffic filtering using passive observation of traffic markers within darknets. These markers represent expected traffic, and their absence suggests network filtering. We analyze data from five large darknets over one week. Our results show that while this approach can reveal filtering in some cases, it also has limitations.

## 1. Introduction
In this paper, we develop a methodology to broadly understand policy-based network filtering across the Internet. Our work is based on three key observations:

1. **Policy-Based Filtering Occurs**: Network operators apply policy-based filters to outgoing traffic for various reasons, such as preventing internal file sharing, blocking open relays, funneling user traffic through proxies, and stopping malware propagation. Previous tools like Netalyzr [12] have used active probing to detect such filtering.

2. **Missing Traffic Reveals Network Behavior**: Research has shown that monitoring dark address space for the absence of expected traffic can indicate broad network outages. This has been studied in the context of political events and natural disasters, where changes in background radiation suggest policy changes.

3. **Ubiquity of Malware**: Compromised devices on edge networks indiscriminately propagate using various vulnerabilities, generating a significant amount of background radiation.

We hypothesize that the ubiquity of background radiation can help form expectations about specific marker traffic. When these expectations are not met, it strongly suggests the presence of a policy-based filter. To test this, we analyze over 96 billion Conficker packets arriving at our darknet to understand TCP port 445 filtering across the Internet.

By studying one week of traffic from five /8 darknets (approximately 2.25% of the IPv4 address space), we find both supporting and refuting evidence for our hypothesis. For Conficker, detecting silence from a given origin network indicates the presence of policy filters. However, other types of traffic do not span enough origin networks to develop reliable expectations. Thus, this method is limited to significant events like full outages or large malware outbreaks. Despite these limitations, the approach still enhances our understanding of policy-based traffic filtering.

## 2. Related Work
Our methodology builds on existing techniques, such as observing background radiation and using darknets as observatories. However, previous work has not addressed inferring service-level network policies via passive observation. Prior studies have used active measurements to study policy-based filtering, which requires instrumenting every edge network. Our goal is to leverage passive measurements to understand the Internet broadly without the logistical challenges of active probing.

The closest related work involves using the lack of background radiation to detect large-scale outages due to natural disasters or political events. We extend this idea to detect service-level policies applied to network traffic.

## 3. Data Collection
We use two primary datasets for this study:

1. **Conficker Infected Hosts**: A list of known Conficker-infected hosts obtained from the Conficker domain sinkhole [13]. The Conficker worm, which has been active since 2008, continues to be a major threat. It propagates via vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and dictionary attacks on passwords. The list contains 17.5 million infected hosts from 1.6 million /24 networks.

2. **Darknet Packet Traces**: We collected packet traces from five unallocated IPv4 darknets: 23.0.0.0/8, 37.0.0.0/8, 45.0.0.0/8, 100.0.0.0/8, and 105.0.0.0/8. With permission from the Regional Internet Registrars (RIRs), we announced these network blocks for one week in January 2011. Our darknet observed traffic to nearly 84 million IPv4 addresses, covering approximately 2.25% of the usable IPv4 address space. This dataset comprises roughly 96.1 billion packets from 4.1 million /24 address blocks.

We classified the darknet data into five categories:
- **Conficker Traffic**: TCP SYNs to port 445 from known Conficker-infected hosts.
- **Likely Conficker Traffic**: TCP SYNs to port 445 from hosts not on the Conficker list but targeting IP addresses known to be scanned by Conficker.
- **Scanning Traffic**: TCP SYNs that could not be produced by Conficker processes.
- **Backscatter Traffic**: SYN+ACK packets likely resulting from spoofed SYNs.
- **Other Traffic**: All remaining traffic.

Figure 1 shows the breakdown of traffic captured in each /8 block, with Conficker traffic being relatively uniform across the monitored blocks.

We acknowledge that source address spoofing is possible and present in the data, as indicated by the backscatter traffic. Therefore, we interpret our results with this ambiguity in mind.

## 4. Preliminaries
Our hypothesis is that background radiation from malware can be used to infer filtering policies across the Internet. In this section, we discuss the efficacy of this approach and its general applicability.
