User: In windows, I am running a bat script that currently ends with a 'pause' and prompts for the user to 'Press any key to continue...'
I am unable to edit the file in this scenario and I need the script to terminate instead of hang waiting for input that will never come. Is there a way I can run this that will disable or circumvent the prompt?
I have tried piping in input and it does not seem to help. This script is being run from python via subprocess.Popen.
Assistant: Try to execute cmd.exe /c YourCmdFile < nul
