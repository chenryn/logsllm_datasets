User: I'm having trouble importing Machine Learning algorithms from scikit-learn.
 I have it installed but whenever I type for example "from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB" it says " 'from' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
 I'm using Anaconda on Windows 10. Is it compatibility issue? Am I missing something? Idk I'm still new to Python so I feel lost. Thanks
Assistant: That needs to be run in the Python REPL, not at a command line. Be sure to start one before typing Python statements.
