Question: "In the context of Android security, what is a valid counterargument to the claim that using a separate SELinux domain `vendor_init` to run vendor-specific commands may be unnecessary?"
 "A": "The vendor init process can restrict access to the system partition, preventing vendors from customizing their devices."
 "B": "A separate domain for vendor-specific commands prevents vendor scripts from instructing init to access files outside of the stable system-vendor ABI."
 "C": "Using the `vendor_init` domain adds complexity to the boot process and can potentially lead to longer boot times."
 "D": "The vendor init subprocess can potentially override the default init context, thereby weakening the system's security posture."
Answer: B
