 Establish surveillance
– Tailing

***Because much of this can get into ILLEGAL areas, it makes sense 
NOT TO DISCUSS specific tools and techniques BEFORE discussing 
relevant laws (included later in this talk)

Important Laws
Wiretaps
 18 USC 2510 - Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 –
Unauthorized interception of an electronic communication (whether 
recorded or not)
 Includes phone, pager, cell phone, cordless phone, fax, or data 
transmission (got sniffer?)
 Penalties include up to 5 years imprisonment, criminal fines, possible 
civil liability
 Law also prohibits illegally intercepted communications from being 
entered as evidence in court
 Law ALSO makes it illegal to use an electronic device to listen to or 
record oral communications, under same penalties
Recording Phone Calls
 Wiretap law applies (previous slide)
 Some notable exceptions:
– Calls can be recorded with consent of at least ONE party (*** 12 
states require consent by BOTH parties – CA, CT, DE, FL, IL, 
MD, MA, MI, NE, NH, PA, WA) 
– Businesses may monitor business-related phone calls of 
employees, using phone company equipment only
– 48 CFR Sec.64.501 (FCC) requires that at least ONE of the 
following occur:
• Both parties consent
• Recording party gives verbal notification before recording
• Must be a regular electronic beep tone during recording
Surveillance
 Established by “case law”, not “statute”
 Non-threatening observation and/or photography from 
publicly accessible areas is acceptable, whereas 
trespassing on private property or altering environment 
(cutting holes in bushes/fences) to aid viewing is not
 Penalties include civil liability for “invasion of privacy” 
or “harassment”, if surveillance is obtrusive or 
threatening
Freedom of Information Act
 5 USC 552 - Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) - Allows public 
access to certain federal government records
 Doesn’t apply to state, local government, Congress, or White House 
courts (however, all states have their own FOIA versions as well)
 “Exclusions” are: current law enforcement investigations, C.I. 
disclosure, FBI records related to terrorism or espionage
 There are also many “exemptions”, which MAY be released unless 
prohibited by other laws or if their release would cause no foreseeable 
harm
 No penalties for violation (at least directly)
 Call 1-800-688-9889 to obtain FOIA “officer contact info” for any 
federal agency 
Privacy Act
 5 USC 552a - Privacy Act of 1974 – Allows any citizen to 
view and amend (if incorrect) any federally maintained 
database information about himself/herself
 Also sets forth guidelines for federal agencies to follow 
when collecting and using data (i.e., name, SSN)
 Penalties for persons obtaining information under false 
pretense OR for federal employees improperly releasing 
information include misdemeanor conviction and up to 
$5K fine
 Civil remedies can be obtained against government 
agencies that violate the act
Mail Inspection
 18 USC 1702, 1708 - Obstruction of Correspondence & 
Theft or Receipt of Stolen Mail – It is a crime to take, steal, 
or remove any mail without permission
 Penalties include fines, imprisonment up to 5 years, 
possible civil liability for invasion of privacy
Trash Inspection (Dumpster Diving)
Established by “case law”, not “statute”
US Supreme Court ruled that “any person who places his/her trash at the curb of a 
public street for pickup has no reasonable expectation of privacy over the trash”
If trash is located in area marked as “private” or “no trespassing”, “diving” is obviously 
illegal
Exceptions:
–
Several municipalities have local ordinances making curbside trash off limits to 
anyone but the “trash man”
–
Hawaii, New Jersey, Washington, and Vermont may have state supreme court 
rulings which conflict with US Supreme Court ruling
–
At least one exception allows trash to be turned over to police after being picked 
up
Penalties include civil and criminal penalties for trespassing and invasion of privacy 
where collection is made from private property
Local municipalities may have additional limited penalties
Economic Espionage
 18 USC 1831 - Economic Espionage Act of 1996 –
Obtaining a trade secret from a U.S. business without 
authorization and providing it to a foreign government, 
agent, or company is a federal crime
 Penalties include up to 15 years imprisonment, fines up to 
$10,000,000, and civil liability
Computer Crime (H4x0ring)
18 USC 1030 - Fraud and Related Activity in Connection with Computers –
Unauthorized access into the computer of a government, business, or person 
is a federal crime if the entry includes removal/copy of information, 
destruction of files, or the planting of any code or virus
Penalties include up to 10 years imprisonment, fines, and persons harmed by 
unauthorized access can sue for compensatory damages and injunctive relief
When unauthorized access to a computer occurs and the only fraud is use of 
the computer and the value of such use is less than $5K in any one year, NO 
CRIME HAS BEEN COMMITTED
Also crimes under this statute:
–
Trafficking in computer passwords with the intent to defraud is also a crime 
under this statute
–
Any threat sent via computer with intent to extort money or anything of value
Several states have implemented more restrictive (simple trespass) laws
Stored Communications
 18 USC 2701 - Electronic Privacy Communications Act 
of 1986 – Unauthorized access to electronically stored 
communications (such as e-mail or telegrams) is a federal 
crime
 Penalties include up to 2 years imprisonment, civil action 
by aggrieved party to recover actual and punitive 
damages
