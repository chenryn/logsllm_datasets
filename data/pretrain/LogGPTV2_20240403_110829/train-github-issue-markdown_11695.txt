While testing the class_weight parameter in several estimators to investigate
#1411, I noticed that the parameter doesn't work as I would expect in
RidgeClassifier either.  
Maybe this is some misunderstanding on my part or some regularization issue,
but if I have noisy labels, I would have expected to be be able to move the
decision boundary.
This is not the case as illustrated in this notebook
Any input would be appreciated.
