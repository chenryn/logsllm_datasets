### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:40 to 18:07:46 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process (user: `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) is failing to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` over a period of 162 to 167 seconds. This issue is logged every second, indicating a persistent problem with lease renewal.
   - Example: 
     ```
     10-18 18:07:40, WARN, LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000, org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer, Failed to renew lease for [DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1] for 162 seconds. Will retry shortly...
     ```

2. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes are detected for both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes. The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` or `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000` or `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - Example:
     ```
     10-18 18:07:40, WARN, LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000, org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client, Address change detected. Old: msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000 New: msra-sa-41:9000
     ```

3. **Connection Issues with Resource Manager (RM)**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is experiencing difficulties connecting to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. It is retrying the connection, but each attempt is logging an error.
   - The retry policy is set to `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between retries.
   - Example:
     ```
     10-18 18:07:42, INFO, RMCommunicator Allocator, org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client, Retrying connect to server: msra-sa-41:8030. Already tried 0 time(s); retry policy is RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)
     10-18 18:07:42, ERROR, RMCommunicator Allocator, org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator, ERROR IN CONTACTING RM.
     ```

### Key Points
- **Lease Renewal**: The `LeaseRenewer` process is unable to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` for a prolonged period, indicating a potential issue with the HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) or network connectivity.
- **Address Changes**: Frequent address changes suggest that there might be a configuration or network issue causing the system to switch between IP addresses and hostnames.
- **Resource Manager Connection**: The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is consistently failing to connect to the Resource Manager, which could impact the overall job scheduling and resource allocation in the Hadoop cluster.

### Recommendations
- **Investigate Network Configuration**: Check the network settings and DNS configurations to ensure that the correct IP addresses and hostnames are being used.
- **Check HDFS Health**: Verify the health of the HDFS and ensure that the NameNode and DataNodes are functioning correctly.
- **Monitor Resource Manager**: Investigate the Resource Manager (RM) to ensure it is running and accessible, and check for any known issues or recent updates that might have caused the connection failures.

By addressing these points, you can work towards resolving the recurring issues in the Hadoop environment.
