User: Anyone knows any "legal" way to surpass the 10-app-limit Google imposes?
I wouldn't mind to pay, or anything, but I wasn't able to find a way to have more
than 10 apps and can't either remove one.
Assistant: Call or write to Google! Google's policies are very exact and very strict, because they are catering to thousands of developers, and thus need those standards and uniformity. But if you have a good reason for needing more than 10, and you can get a real person at the end of a telephone line, I'd think you'd have a good chance of getting the limit raised.
Alternatively, you could just get a friend or co-worker to register. That seems like it ought to be legal...but check the User Agreement first.
