+ The book [Resilience and Reliability on AWS](https://www.amazon.com/Resilience-Reliability-AWS-Jurg-Vliet/dp/1449339190) provides  a motivation and a few examples (for beginners) on the importance of reliability. The author shares their experience to achieve resilience and reliability with code examples to monitor Redis or MongoDB. The use of simple techniques to solve the complex problem of reliability of clouds clearly indicates that current solutions are limited and further systmathic approaches are needed.

### Anomaly Detection
+ (Process-based) In Experience report: Anomaly detection of cloud application operations using log and cloud metric correlation analysis (2015), the authors present an approach to detect anomalies by correlating data & events extracted from logs and metrics generated by Amazon AWS. While the approach is interesting, the level of detail provided by Amazon logging system does not enable to gain an insightful view and prediction of failures.
+ (Path-based) In patent [Diagnosing distributed applications using application logs and request processing paths](https://www.google.com/patents/US20140136692) and [Patent US9069668](https://www.google.com/patents/US9069668), the authors inject faults into the so-called transaction path, detecting a writing action to a log of the distributed application. When a failure occurs, the path is marked as problematic.
+ Generic approaches for reliability such as Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Root cause analysis (RCA), Failure mode and effects analysis (FMCA), Cause–effect graphs, Ishikawa diagram, Five whys, etc.
### Distributed Tracing
Traditional monitoring solutions for cloud platforms and applications, such as [Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) from Amazon AWS, [Ceilometer](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Telemetry) from Openstack, and [Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/), place emphasis on *component-based monitoring*. Existing solutions collect detailed information on system statistics about virtual machines, CPU, disk IO, hosts, RPC, etc.
Component-based monitoring tools provide not information into the relationship between the components of a distributed service. Since debugging a distributed system is a danting task using these tools, cross-component monitoring (tracing) solutions were explored to aliviate exisitng limitation by tracing the path of events and method calls that are generated at runtime.
The study from Sambasivan, Raja R., et al. titled [So, you want to trace your distributed system? Key design insights from years of practical experience](http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/PDL-FTP/SelfStar/CMU-PDL-14-102.pdf) (Vol. 102. Technical Report, CMU-PDL-14, 2014) provides a very good overview of tracing systems developed up to 2014, and include the analysis of X-Trace, Magpie, Dapper, etc. The thesis from Nathan Scott of the Monash University, Australia, titled [Unifying Event Trace and Sampled Performance Data] (http://pcp.io/papers/unifying-thesis.pdf) also give a fairly good overview of these main tracing systems.
+ [X-Trace](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/papers/2007/xtr-nsdi07.pdf) from [Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) outputs a set of task graphs according to Lamport’s happens before relation to trace the execution path of a distributed system. It does not rely on physical clocks and uses low level primitives for instrumentation (e.g., xtr::logEvent(string), xtr::logEvent("end"), pushdown(), and pushnext()).
+ [Magpie](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/magpie/) from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) infers traces by combining event logs generated by low level black-box instrumentation. It automatically extracting individual requests from a running system and constructs a probabilistic workload model. Magpie relies on experts with deep knowledge about the system to construct a schema of how to correlate events in different components. In contrast to other approach (from Google, Twitter, and Cloudera), it infers causal relations from the events generated by the operating system and application instrumentation.
+ [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html) from [Google](http://www.google.com) focuses on library and middleware modifications and provides a special context to track execution across async callbacks and RPCs.
+ HTrace from [Cloudera](https://www.cloudera.com/) is a tracing framework intended for use with distributed systems written in java. It is similar to Dapper and performs end-to-end tracing to capture detailed paths of causally between events generated by the components which make a distributed system.
+ [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io) from Twitter is also a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. Zipkin's design is based on the Google Dapper.

+ [Openstracing](https://github.com/opentracing) OpenTracing is an open distributed tracing standard for applications. Since distributed tracing is important for large-scale distributed systems management and complex services architectures, OpenTracing was created in 2016 to address the standardization problems from instrumentation.

Service Systems
---------------
Our research on service systems placed emphasis on three fields: service description languages (with the USDL family), service system modeling (with the LSS USDL language), service analytics (using process mining), and 
service networks (using principals from social networks).
The video above explains the goal of USDL (please note that since then, XML has been replaced by RDFS)
**Service Analytics**. We analyse large logs from IT service provisioning (e.g., ITIL) to find human behaviour patterns which are rewarded or penalized. Interesting work. It is the new challenge for companies, the future so to say: to analyse people behaviour... My new upcoming book on Service Systems Fundamentals/Springer will have a chapter dedicated to the topic.
**Service Descriptions**. Linked USDL (Unified Service Description Language) enables describing business, software, or real-world services using computer-readable and computer-understandable specifications to make them tradable on the web/Internet. It uses RDFS to provide a shared model. 
See Github and linked-usdl.org
**Service Systems**. The Linked Service System model for the Unified Service Description Language (LSS-USDL) explores the development of lightweight semantic models to capture the essence of service systems. Real service systems can be modeled with LSS-USDL, they can be accessed and queried programmatically, and they can be annotated with background knowledge. 
See Github and this recent book Service Systems. This approach provides descriptions that can be used for service management, optimization, and analytics.
**Service Networks**. Societies are becoming increasingly service-oriented. Service revenues from companies, such as Rolls Royce, Caterpillar, and ThyssenKrupp, often reach more than 35% of total sales. In the field of information technology, the global spending on cloud services is expected to grow 40% over the next seven years. Despite these facts, services are still the least studied part of the economy.
The observation that the power of service-based economies is no longer restricted to individual organizations, but spans across networks, is the main driver for conducting service network research. Networks play an important role in many application areas such as energy grid distribution and smart city planning. Service networks are a class of networks of emerging interest since worldwide economies are becoming increasingly connected. Nonetheless, while the economies of many countries are becoming service-oriented, very few studies on service networks exist. Understanding when, why, where, and how service networks function best is fundamental for the future because their analysis can provide an x-ray of service-based economies.

Semantic Domain System
----------------------
Enterprises have the need to communicate. In business to business applications, usually XML is used to automatically  exchange information. But sometimes more semantics is needed. Enterprises  also need to share concepts, terms,  definitions and relationships (between concepts) relevant to their business activities.
Why are developing the Semantic Domain System which is a systems that follows similar concepts from the DNS.
The Domain Name System or DNS, is a service where relationships between IP addresses and physical domains are stored.
When you request your browser, email client, ftp client or any other application to search for a specific domain,
it automatically calls the DNS Server and finds the IP for the machine that offers the required service. It enables the use of names instead of IP addresses. Each company is responsible for maintaining their own IP addresses.
In SDS, like in DNS, each company is responsible for managing their own concepts and is able to browse other companies'
concept definitions. The system will allow a clear representation of concepts and relationships between concepts.
Semantic B2B Integration
------------------------
B2B integration, also known as external IS integration and e-business integration, has promised to automate and
integrate business processes and interactions between companies by considerably renovating the way business was
conducted with partners, suppliers, and customers. B2B integration is fundamentally about data and information
exchange among businesses and their information systems. The ability to interact and exchange information both
internally and with external organizations (partners, suppliers, customers) is a fundamental issue in the enterprise sector.
One simple solution that organizations have adopted to reach a higher level of integration relied on the use of XML as the language to represent data. XML has become a de facto standard of B2B because of its simplicity, extensibility and ease of processing. Today its estimated that most organizations use XML to store and transfer data. This is the reason why we created B2BISS (Business-to-Business Integration using Syntactic-to-Semantic Mapping).
JXML2OWL
--------
Today's enterprises face critical needs in integrating disparate information spread over several data sources inside and even outside the organization. Semantic web technologies, such as ontologies, play an important role in the semantic integration of data. The purpose of JXMLOWL is to present a framework to assist the semantic data integration process.
The framework supports mappings and instances transformation from syntactic data sources in XML format to a common global model defined by an ontology using semantic web related technologies such as OWL.
Business Process Quality Metrics
----------------------
Our intentions are twofold. On the one hand, we think it is fundamental to survey findings from neighboring disciplines on how Business Process Quality Metrics can be developed. In particular, we believe that we can gather additional insights from software engineering, cognitive science, and graph theory and relate them to business process modeling.
A further empirical investigation might ultimately lead to establishing a complexity theory of business process models. On the other hand, we plan to demonstrate that these metrics serves their purpose, we plan to carry out several empirical validations by means of controlled experiments.
