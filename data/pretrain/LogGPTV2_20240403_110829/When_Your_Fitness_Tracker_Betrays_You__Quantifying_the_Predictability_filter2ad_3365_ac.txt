measure has little inﬂuence in cross-device settings [2].
Factor w in Equation 3 is a factor used to normalize the
distance d in the interval [0, 1] (details on the computation
of w are given in Appendix B). Further, we tweak the
objective function of Equation 2 to be robust against noisy
estimations for the distributions of particular users. Namely,
let I = {1, . . . , n}, then for each function fθ we deﬁne a
⊆ I as follows: (i)
subset of the user population indexes Ifθ

able have highly non-overlapping distributions. This means
that the differences between the j-th feature values in the

Score Interpretation. The weighted unpredictability score
Wv of a biometric modality (Equation 6) depends on the
scores of the individual features, with distinctive features
contributing more to it. It should be noted that the score
itself does not directly correspond to a certain success
rate of an actual attack, because the cross-context mapping
effectiveness also depends on the speciﬁc template matching
algorithm and false accept and false reject rates thresholds.
The main advantage of the unpredictability score lies in
its comparative capability, rather than in being an absolute
scale. The score can be used to compare different bio-
metrics, with biometrics with higher unpredictability scores
across all sources being judged more secure. Similarly, a
system developer can use the scores to identify vulnerable
target contexts. For example, a biometric might exhibit low
unpredictability scores on speciﬁc devices (e.g., due to lower
quality sensors). In that case, a developer could change the
classiﬁer’s decision threshold to account for the increased
danger of cross-context attacks.
Lastly, individual feature unpredictability scores U
(gj )
v
can be a driving factor in the selection and engineering of
features. Higher security can be achieved both by changing
the deﬁnition of features and by modifying sensor hardware
(e.g., by making it less similar to common source contexts).
5.2. Weighted Score
5.3. Evaluation Methodology
Following on from the previous section, we know that
we obtain an unpredictability score for each feature in the
feature-set. We want to aggregate this score to the level
of the whole biometric modality (across the features), so
that it provides an idea of the resilience of a particular
biometric to this transformation. A simple average of the
unpredictability score for each feature is not reasonable,
as features contribute differently to the recognition. For
example, if a non-distinctive feature is very predictable, it
might have a signiﬁcant negative inﬂuence on the overall
score. This is not the desired effect, as an attacker would
gain very little by correctly predicting that feature.
RMI Weights. We weight features based on Relative Mutual
Information (RMI). To avoid problems with the choice of the
number of bins (that may introduce bias in the mutual infor-
mation), we adopt the non-parametric RMI computation of
Ross [34]. In this approach, mutual information is computed
based on the relationship between a data point’s neighbours
and its class neighbours. We weight each feature mapping
result with the feature’s RMI and obtain an aggregated score
that accounts for feature distinctiveness this way.
Formally, given the set of features for a biometric
{gj}j=1,...,m, the victim user v and each feature RMI value
{rj}j=1,...,m we compute a RMI-weighted unpredictability
score Wv:

Cross-Validation. For the evaluation of the cross-context
mapping, we operate in a leave-one-out cross-validation
fashion. At each step i, we consider one user ui as the victim
and we use the remaining 29 users as the population. With
the population, for each feature, we compute the optimal
cross-context mapping fθ∗ and the prediction error for the
victim source observations to the victim target observations.
We obtain U
(Equation 5) and Wv (Equation 6) this
way. This step is repeated for each user. If not otherwise
speciﬁed, the results shown are averages of unpredictability
scores over the users in our dataset. The RMI is computed
on the feature distribution of the population obtained in the
ﬁrst session, for the target context.
Considered Scenarios. In the evaluation, we select a set of
sources for each biometric and consider the scenario where
the adversary has the information from an individual source,
or for the full set of sources (all). In the second case, the
adversary uses the source with the best performing cross-
context mapping (lowest unpredictability) for each feature.
This scenario constitutes the strongest attacker since some
sources may be useful to predict some features but not oth-
ers. Additionally, we consider two different time scenarios:
same session and cross session. The former represents the
case in which the victim’s source and target data are col-
lected in the same session, which leads to greater similarity.
In the latter, the victim’s source data were collected in a
different session than the victim’s target data. Intuitively,
this reﬂects the case of the attacker’s source data being older
or newer than the victim’s template.

6. Results
In this section we present the results of our analysis. We
ﬁrst explain the choice of the source and target contexts and
present high-level results. Afterwards, we show a feature-
level analysis and discuss the effect of the population size.
6.1. Context Choice
In order to present data in a readable way, we select
a subset of target and source contexts, following the most
relevant attack vectors presented in the threat model. Of the
30 possible target contexts coming from our experimental
design (see Table 2), we select ﬁve possible targets (one for
each biometric) and a number of representative sources for
each of them. The chosen contexts are the following:
• Gait – Pocket phone-walk: we select the pocket phone
with walking activity as target. We consider ﬁve dif-
ferent contexts: Smartwatch-walk, Hand phone-walk,
Smartwatch-run, Chest strap-run and Arm phone-run.
• Touch dynamics – Mid-end phone:
the middle-end
phone represents the reasonable choice, as it allows us
to measure the effect of using higher and lower quality
devices as sources.
Figure 4: Unpredictability score for different combinations
of source and target tasks for the eye movement biometric.
Numbers in brackets are the average scores for the respective
source or target. Intuitively, using data collected during the
same task yields the lowest unpredictability scores (shown
on the diagonal).
• ECG – Authenticator-rest:
the Authenticator (Nymi
band) uses ECG for authentication purposes and there-
fore represent an ideal target. All the remaining ECG
sensors are considered as the sources, including the dif-
ferent measurements obtained with the medical monitor:
Lead I, Lead II, Lead III, Palm.
• Eye movements – Calibrated: all the calibrated tasks
are considered as target. We consider only uncalibrated
data as the source and separate between uncalibrated
data coming from the same task (e.g., Uncalibrated-
reading to Calibrated-reading) and uncalibrated data
coming from different tasks (e.g., Uncalibrated-writing
to Calibrated-reading).
• Mouse – Mouse: we select Mouse as a target and will
use Trackpad as source.
Hereafter, results will refer to these target contexts.
Additional results are reported in Appendix A.
6.2. Biometrics Overview
In Table 4 we report the resulting RMI weighted scores
for each target and source context considered in Section 6.1.
The ﬁrst rows report the aggregated results over the sources:
average, minimum and all weighted score (see Section 5.3).
In Table 4, we can see that biometrics rank differently
in terms of unpredictability. The table shows that ECG
and gait are on average more resilient to the cross-context
transformation, in both the same session and cross session
scenarios. Gait in particular is very resilient to cross-context
attacks, with an unpredictability score two times higher
compared to touch dynamics, eye and mouse movements.

dynamics (Fig. 5c) and mouse movements (Fig. 5d) biometric. Features are sorted by RMI (descending from left to right).
RMI is reported in percentage on the x-axis label.
This means that
the different placement of the sensors
provide poor information about the gait signal as measured
in other contexts. Comparatively low results are obtained
for eye movements, touch dynamics and mouse. Most of
these biometric features are easily and consistently mapped
across source contexts (see the discussion in Subsection 6.3).
For the eye movements biometric there are also differences
depending on the respective source and target task, shown in
Figure 4. Naturally, intra-task mappings produce the lowest
unpredictability score (as the only difference is the lack of
calibration for the source task), while cross-task mappings
perform particularly poorly for some combinations. The re-
sults show that an attacker could gain a signiﬁcant advantage
if they are able to choose the source task freely.
Comparing the average, minimum and all score we can
see that: (i) by selecting the appropriate source context
the adversary can expect an improvement of ∼10% on
average, that is, from average to minimum score (consistent
across same and cross session scenarios); (ii) by combining
information from several sources the adversary might obtain
a further improvement up to ∼15% (again consistent across
same and cross session scenarios), that is, from minimum
to all score. This means that it might be worthwhile for
an adversary to obtain biometric information over a higher
number of sources and selectively choose to map individual
features from whichever source provides the lowest unpre-
dictability score for that feature.
The results show that same-session scores are lower
compared to cross-session scores for ECG and eye move-
ments in particular. As a result, an attack would appear to
be more likely to succeed if very recent data (as in the
same-session experiment) is used. However, the authenti-
cation system itself has to cope with the (lack of) time
stability which causes this difference. Most likely, this will
be achieved through either periodic retraining or continuous
template updating. While template updating will make false
rejects as a result of increasing time distance less likely, it
will also enable the attacker to use older data for the attack.

6.3. Feature Analysis
In order to understand to what extent individual fea-
tures contribute to the overall score, we analyze them
separately. We report
in Figure 5 boxplots for the raw
(non-weighted) cross-context feature unpredictability scores.
Each box shows the unpredictability score for a single fea-
ture from the source context to the target context. Features
are ordered by decreasing RMI on the x-axis and the RMI
value is reported on the x-axis. For conciseness, for each
biometric, we only show a couple of meaningful sources
and present just the top-ten RMI-ranked features, as these
are the ones that contribute the most to the weighted score.
ECG. We notice that the type of sensor used as the source
has a signiﬁcant impact on the weighted unpredictability
score (conﬁrming the results of [2]). In Figure 5a we can
see how Mobile consistently outperforms Lead III for each
feature. This can be explained by closer similarity of the
ECG signal when measured at the extremity of the subject’s
arms (true for Lead I, Mobile and the target Authenticator)
compared to for example the Lead III measurements, which
measures voltage potential between the left arm and left leg.
The differences in predictability for different sources shown
in Table 4 and Figure 5a highlight that ECG-based authen-
tication might still be secure if the adversary steals ECG
data from dissimilar contexts, but becomes less secure the
easier it is to obtain data from similar contexts. Hand-based
measurements are convenient and common (as shown by the
popularity of e-health devices), this highlights the danger of
using the same type of measurement for authentication.
Eye movements. Figure 5b shows how most eye move-
ments features are highly predictable, both pupil-based and
speed- or acceleration-based ones. The boxplot additionally
shows how Intra task consistently provides relatively lower
unpredictability than Cross task, which show that each task
produces feature changes that depend on the user. Our threat
model considers the case of the victim using a compromised
machine with a covert eye tracker (see Section 3). The
results show that if the attacker can choose the task on
this machine freely (i.e., close to that on the authentication
machine), he will obtain more useful data.
Touch dynamics. In Figure 5c we can see that High-end
phones provide slightly lower unpredictability scores com-
pared to Low-end phones. The low result of stroke duration
shows that such feature is easily predictable across devices.
This is intuitively explained with users adjusting the length
of their swipes to the size of the touchscreen. In a feature se-
lection scenario, a system designer might reasonably decide
to drop stroke duration from the feature-set. In fact, even
if the feature has a decent distinctiveness, it is extremely
predictable compared to other similarly distinctive features.
