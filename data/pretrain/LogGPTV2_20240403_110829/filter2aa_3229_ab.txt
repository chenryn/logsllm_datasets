### User Identity Theft

#### Slide 41: Key Elements
- **User ID, Domain Credentials, Sessions**
- **Impersonate System Accounts**
- **Simulate Normal User Behavior**

#### Slide 42: Stages and Techniques
- **Target Users**
  - Identify who has access to what.
  - Determine the location of sensitive data.
- **Change Identity**
  - Hijack credentials or sessions.
  - Abuse security tokens.
- **Access as the End Goal**
  - The primary objective is to gain access to data or other systems.

#### Slide 43: Existing Tools
- **Incognito (Metasploit)**
  - Enumerate and hijack security tokens.
- **FU/FUTO**
  - Enable SYSTEM privileges.
  - Modify process privileges via Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM).
- **SU / SUDO / KSU**
  - Elevate privileges.
- **Process Injection**
  - Inject code into running processes.
- **Hijack Domain Credentials**
  - Gain unauthorized access to domain accounts.

#### Slide 44: Security Components
- **Tokens, Privileges, Security Descriptors, SIDs, SACLs, DACLs, ACEs**
- **Desired Outcomes**
  - Obtain elevated privileges or SIDs.
  - Achieve unrestricted access.
- **Methods**
  - Compare tools like Incognito and FUto for effectiveness.

#### Slide 45: Demos
- Practical demonstrations of the techniques discussed.

### Feature Modification

#### Slide 46: Overview
- **Objective**
  - Alter existing features or settings to facilitate post-exploitation activities.
- **Goals**
  - Support all post-exploitation tasks.
  - Disable detection technologies.
  - Enable insecure or easily accessible software.

#### Slide 47: Securable Object Manipulation
- **Key Concepts**
  - Tokens and security descriptors can be modified programmatically.
  - Custom tools may be more advantageous for stealth and persistence.
  - Accessing objects programmatically can be complex but highly effective.

#### Slide 48: Re-enabling Disabled Access
- **PsExec**
  - A powerful remote shell/command tool.
  - Often disabled due to security concerns.
  - Re-enable it using `sc.exe`:
    - `Net use \\target\ipc$ username /user:password`
    - `Sc \\target config netdde start= auto`
    - `Sc \\target config netddedsdm start= auto`
    - `Sc \\target config clipsrv start= auto`
    - `Sc \\target start netdde`
    - `Sc \\target start netddedsdm`
    - `Sc \\target start clipserv`

#### Slide 49: Enabling VNC from Command Line
- **Steps**
  - Download VNC from guh.nu.
  - Create a folder on the target for VNC files.
  - Copy necessary files to the target folder.
  - Use `regedit` to apply the VNC registry settings.
  - Install and start the VNC server with a specified password.

#### Slide 50: Enabling Remote Desktop Remotely
- **Necessity**
  - GUI access is often required for specialized applications.
  - Remote desktop is fast and built into the OS but may be disabled.
- **Procedure**
  - Create and apply configuration files to enable remote desktop.
  - Modify security policies and update group policy settings.

#### Slide 51: Demos
- Practical demonstrations of the techniques discussed.

### Abusing the Scheduler

#### Slide 56: Introduction
- **Overview**
  - Utilize old-school techniques for modern problems.
  - Post-exploitation context: you already have some level of access.
  - Use the `AT` command to schedule tasks.

#### Slide 57: Common Uses
- **Features and Limitations**
  - Many security features are disabled, but `AT` is often still enabled.
  - `AT` can perform a wide range of tasks, such as enabling services, transferring files, adding users, and modifying the registry.

#### Slide 58: Building a Tool Around AT
- **Workflow**
  - Establish an authenticated session.
  - Determine the target's time.
  - Schedule commands to run at a specific time.
  - Execute batch files and retrieve desired information.

#### Slide 59: Common Example
- **Steps**
  - Establish a network connection.
  - Check the target's time.
  - Schedule tasks to add a user, elevate privileges, and dump hashes.
  - Send the results back to the attacker.

#### Slide 60: Privileges of LocalSystem
- **Key Privileges**
  - NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs.
  - SE_IMPERSONATE_NAME, SE_TCB_NAME, SE_DEBUG_NAME.

### Massive Automation

#### Slide 63: Introduction
- **Objectives**
  - Automate techniques and tools for large-scale attacks.
  - Penetrate many systems with minimal interaction and in a short time.
  - Ensure ease of use and reusability.
  - Lower the cost of attack.

#### Slide 64: Tools
- **MassNetUse**
  - Establish NetBIOS sessions and credentials on multiple hosts.
- **MassWinenum**
  - Enumerate NetBIOS information, bypassing certain RestrictAnonymous settings.
- **AtAbuse**
  - Use the scheduler to control ranges of hosts.

#### Slide 65: Demos
- Practical demonstrations of the techniques discussed.
