In Matlab there's the `format` command, which provides output format
modification for e.g. the displayed precision and other things like
engineering format. As an engineer, the latter is of particular interest to
me, since only showing exponents which are multiples of 3, makes it a lot
easier to work with calculated values. This should affect both display() and
show(). Could this be implemented?
