Question: "When comparing penetration testing methodologies, what could be a significant advantage of using the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) over the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM) for an organization that wants a structured approach to testing that includes post-exploitation activities and detailed reporting?"
 "A": "PTES provides a structured 7-phase approach including post-exploitation and reporting, which is ideal for organizations seeking comprehensive guidelines."
 "B": "OSSTMM includes post-testing activities, but it mainly focuses on operational security, which may not be as structured as what PTES offers."
 "C": "PTES lacks guidance on post-exploitation activities, making OSSTMM the better choice for structured testing and reporting."
 "D": "OSSTMMâ€™s focus on physical and human security testing makes it more comprehensive than PTES for structured penetration testing."
Answer: A
