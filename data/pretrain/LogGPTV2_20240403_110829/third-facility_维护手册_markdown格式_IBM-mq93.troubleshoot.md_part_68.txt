### Package Inclusion and Exclusion for Tracing in IBM MQ

#### Inclusion and Exclusion Options
- To include a package in the trace, use the `-ip package_name` option, where `package_name` is the name of your package.
- To exclude a package from the trace, run the executable JAR file with the options `-i identifier -ep package_name`.

**Note:**
- You can use multiple `-ip` and `-ep` options. These options are not checked for consistency.
- When you specify a package for exclusion or inclusion, the handling of packages that have matching prefixes is not affected. For example, excluding the package `com.ibm.mq.jms` would not exclude `com.ibm.mq`, `com.ibm.msq.client.jms`, or `com.ibm.mq.remote.api`, but it would exclude `com.ibm.mq.jms.internal`.

#### Example Commands and Output

1. **List Trace Identifiers:**
   ```sh
   C:>java -jar MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -list
   10008 : 'MQSample'
   9004 : ' MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -list'
   ```

2. **Check Trace Status:**
   ```sh
   C:>java -jar MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -i 10008 -status
   Tracing enabled : false
   User Directory : C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\RTCworkspace\sandpit
   Trace File Name : mqjakarta.trc
   Package Include/Exclude tree
   root - Included
   ```

3. **Enable Tracing:**
   ```sh
   C:>java -jar MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -i 10008 -enable
   Enabling trace
   Tracing enabled : true
   ```

4. **Include and Exclude Packages:**
   ```sh
   C:>java -jar MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -i 10008 -ip com.ibm.mq.jakarta.jms
   Adding 'com.ibm.mq.jakarta.jms' to the list of packages included in trace
   ```

5. **Add Multiple Packages:**
   ```sh
   C:>java -jar MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -i 10008 -ip com.acme.banana -ep com.acme.banana.split -ip com.acme.banana.shake
   Adding 'com.acme.banana' to the list of packages included in trace
   Adding 'com.acme.banana.shake' to the list of packages included in trace
   Adding 'com.acme.banana.split' to the list of packages excluded from trace
   ```

6. **Check Updated Trace Status:**
   ```sh
   C:>java -jar MQ_INSTALLATION_PATH/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jakarta.client.jar -traceControl -i 10008 -status
   Tracing enabled : true
   User Directory : C:\Users\IBM_ADMIN\RTCworkspace\sandpit
   Trace File Name : mqjakarta_10008.trc
   Package Include/Exclude tree
   root - Included
   com - Included
   acme - Included
   banana - Included
   shake - Included
   split - Excluded
   ibm - Included
   mq - Included
   jakarta - Included
   jms - Included
   ```

#### Package Inclusion-Exclusion Tree

The tracing mechanism for IBM MQ classes for Java and IBM MQ classes for JMS tracks the inclusion and exclusion of packages using a tree structure starting from a root node. Each node represents one element of a package name and contains a trace status (Included or Excluded).

**Initial Tree Structure:**
```plaintext
root - Included
com - Included
ibm - Included
mq - Included
headers - Excluded
pcf - Excluded
```

**Example Updates:**

- **Excluding `com.ibm.mq.jms`:**
  ```plaintext
  root - Included
  com - Included
  ibm - Included
  mq - Included
  headers - Excluded
  jms - Excluded
  pcf - Excluded
  ```

- **Including `com.ibm.mq.jms.admin`:**
  ```plaintext
  root - Included
  com - Included
  ibm - Included
  mq - Included
  headers - Excluded
  jms - Excluded
  admin - Included
  pcf - Excluded
  ```

#### Remote Connection

To connect remotely, the process must be started with a JMX agent enabled for remote connection using the system setting:
```sh
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=port_number
```

Then, run the executable JAR file with the options:
```sh
-h host_name -p port_number
```
where `host_name` is the name of the host and `port_number` is the port to be used.

**Note:**
- Ensure appropriate security measures by enabling TLS for the connection. See Oracle's JMX documentation for details: [Oracle JMX Documentation](https://www.oracle.com).

#### Limitations

- **Non-IBM JVMs:**
  The tool must be started with `tools.jar` added to its class path. Use the following command:
  ```sh
  java -cp MQ_INSTALL_DIR/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.traceControl.jar;JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar com.ibm.msg.client.commonservices.trace.TraceController
  ```

- **Local Attach:**
  The tool must be run under the same user ID as the process to be controlled.

#### Tracing the IBM MQ Resource Adapter

The `ResourceAdapter` object encapsulates the global properties of the IBM MQ resource adapter. To enable trace, define properties in the `ResourceAdapter` object.

**Properties:**

| Property Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
|---------------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `traceEnabled` | String | `false` | A flag to enable or disable diagnostic tracing. If `false`, tracing is turned off. |
| `traceLevel` | String | `3` | The level of detail in a diagnostic trace. Range: `0` (no trace) to `10` (most detail). |
| `logWriterEnabled` | String | `true` | A flag to enable or disable sending a diagnostic trace to a `LogWriter` object. |

**Trace Levels:**

| Level | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| `0` | No trace. |
| `1` | Error messages. |
| `3` | Error and warning messages. |
| `6` | Error, warning, and information messages. |
| `8` | Error, warning, and information messages, and entry and exit information for methods. |
| `9` | Error, warning, and information messages, entry and exit information for methods, and diagnostic data. |
| `10` | All trace information. |

**Procedure:**

- Set the following properties to enable diagnostic tracing on AIX and Linux systems:
  ```sh
  traceEnabled: true
  traceLevel: 10
  ```

- Use the `-D` flag to set these properties as JVM system properties:
  ```sh
  java ... -DtraceEnabled=true -DtraceLevel=10
  ```

**Hints and Tips:**

- Not all properties need to be defined; unspecified properties take their default values.
- In a managed environment, avoid mixing JVM system properties and `ResourceAdapter` properties. JVM system properties take precedence.

#### Tracing Additional IBM MQ Java Components

For Java components like IBM MQ Explorer and the Java implementation of IBM MQ Transport for SOAP, diagnostic information is output using standard IBM MQ diagnostic facilities or Java diagnostic classes.

**System Properties:**

- `com.ibm.mq.commonservices`: Specifies a Java property file for configuring diagnostic outputs.
- `com.ibm.mq.commonservices.diagid`: Associates trace and FFDC files with the process.

**Related Concepts:**

- **Tracing TLS**: Refer to "Tracing TLS: runmqakm, strmqikm, and runmqckm functions" on page 466 for instructions on tracing Transport Layer Security (TLS) and related functions.
- **Tracing on Windows**: Use `strmqtrc` and `endmqtrc` commands or IBM MQ Explorer to start and end tracing on Windows.
