User: I wanted to update my python 2.6.1 to 3.x on mac but i was wondering if its possible to do it using terminal or i have to download the installer from python website? 
The reason why i am asking this question is because installer is not updating my terminal python version.
Assistant: If it were me, I would just leave it as it is.
Use python3 and pip3 to run your files since python and python3 can coexist.

brew install python3 && cp /usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/python

You can use the above line but it might have unintended consequences.
