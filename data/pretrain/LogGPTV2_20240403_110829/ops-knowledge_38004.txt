Create Nginx configuration Create a new configuration file in the /etc/nginx/sites-available/ directory: ``` sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf ``` Add the following to the file: ``` server { listen 80; server_name your_domain_name.com; location / { proxy_pass http://your_upstream_server_ip:port; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ``` Note: In the above configuration, $your_domain_name will be replaced by your domain name, $your_upstream_server_ip and $port will be replaced by the IP address and Port number substitution. 3. Enable the reverse proxy configuration Use the following command to enable the reverse proxy configuration: ``` sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ ``` 4 . Restart the Nginx service Restart the Nginx service using the following command: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` 5. Test the Nginx reverse proxy server Now you can test your Nginx reverse proxy server. After pointing your domain name to this server, use any web browser to visit the domain name. The request will be forwarded to your configured upstream server. If everything worked, you should see the upstream server's response in your browser.
