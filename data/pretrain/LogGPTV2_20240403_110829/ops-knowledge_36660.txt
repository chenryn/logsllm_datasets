User: How to to send out a pwm signal from the serial port with linux? (With python or c++)
I want to connect a motor directly to change the speed rotation.
Assistant: doubt you can do this you are using a uart interface...just get an arduino or someat and send serial commands to the arduino (serial pins) which then puts the correct pwm signal out its pins ... probably 5 lines of arduino code and another 5 of python code ...
all that said you may be able to find some very difficult and hacky way to output a PWM signal over serial ... but you need to think about if thats really appropriate ...
