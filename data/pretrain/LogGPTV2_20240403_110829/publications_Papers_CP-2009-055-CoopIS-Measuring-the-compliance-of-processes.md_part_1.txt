**Abstract:**
Reference models provide a set of generally accepted best practices for creating efficient processes to be deployed within organizations. However, a central challenge is determining how these best practices are implemented in practice. One limitation of existing approaches for measuring compliance is the assumption that compliance can be determined using the notion of process equivalence. Nonetheless, the use of equivalence algorithms is not adequate since two models can have different structures but one process can still be compliant with the other. This paper presents a new approach and algorithm to measure the compliance of process models with reference models. We evaluate our approach by measuring the compliance of a model currently used by a German passenger airline with the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) reference model and comparing our results with existing approaches.

**1. Introduction**
Reference models have gained increasing attention due to their substantial contribution to designing and executing processes efficiently. While reference models are useful, it is crucial to understand the extent to which these best practices are adopted and implemented in specific business contexts. Process mining algorithms [1, 17] have shown considerable potential for assessing the compliance of instances with reference models. The instances, typically recorded by process-aware information systems (IS), serve as a starting point for reconstructing an as-is process model. This derived model can be compared with other models (e.g., reference models) using existing algorithms to determine process equivalence. However, the results of a former compliance analysis using process mining and equivalence algorithms were found to be insufficient [11].

Our previous studies evaluated the compliance of an as-is process model of a passenger airline with a reference model that incorporated the fundamentals of ITIL [15]. We found that the available techniques yielded low compliance values, which could not be confirmed by the passenger airline. This discrepancy was primarily due to:
1. Different levels of detail.
2. A partial view of process mining.
3. Overemphasis on the order of activities.

First, the level of detail characterizing a process varies widely when comparing a reference model with an as-is or to-be process model. Second, the derived as-is model only partially represents the processes of the airline. The execution of processes results in log files, written records, manual activities, and human knowledge. Information outside the reach of process mining algorithms may compromise the results of compliance. Finally, reference models typically do not specify whether dependencies between activities are compulsory. During our previous studies [11] on compliance using existing equivalence algorithms, we changed the order of activities in a reference model. Despite the reference model not enforcing a specific order for activity execution, the compliance results differed.

This paper highlights the importance of measuring the compliance of process models with reference models. We discuss the differences between process equivalence and process compliance and argue for the need for specific algorithms to measure compliance. We show that two models can have different structures but one process can still be compliant with the other. Furthermore, we develop a new approach and algorithm to overcome the identified drawbacks. We measure the compliance of an as-is process model of a German passenger airline with a reference model. To validate our methodology, we compare our compliance results with two existing approaches and explain why current algorithms are not suitable for evaluating compliance.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the fundamentals of reference models. Section 3 explains our methodology for measuring compliance. Section 4 investigates the requirements for determining compliance. Section 5 presents and evaluates our rationale and concept for developing a new algorithm. Section 6 describes the main related work. Finally, Section 7 formulates our conclusions based on our findings.

**2. The Importance of Reference Models**
Reference models offer a set of generally accepted, sound, and efficient processes. Their adoption is motivated by several reasons:
1. They significantly speed up the design of process models by providing reusable and high-quality content.
2. They optimize the design, as they have been developed over a long period and usually capture the business insights of experts [25].
3. They ease compliance with industry regulations and requirements, thus mitigating risk.
4. They create a link between business needs and IT implementations [25].

Reference models can be differentiated by their scope, granularity, and the views depicted in the model [25]. We distinguish between:
1. Reference models focusing on capturing domain-specific best practices, such as ITIL, COBIT, and SCOR.
2. Configurable reference models, such as SAP Solution Manager [18], which aim to capture the functionalities of a software system.

Although this paper focuses on the first class of models, we briefly explain both classes regarding their characteristics and contributions to compliance.

The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a set of guidance published as a series of books by the Office of Government Commerce. These books describe an integrated best-practice approach to managing and controlling IT services [15]. The Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) has been developed by the IT Governance Institute to describe good practices, provide a process framework, and present activities in a manageable and logical structure. The Supply Chain Operations Reference Model (SCOR) provides a unique framework that links business processes and technology features into a unified structure to support communication among supply chain partners and improve the effectiveness of supply chains [19].

A process is considered compliant with the introduced reference models if it is implemented as described by the reference model and its results comply with laws, regulations, and contractual arrangements [21]. Other popular reference models include the APQC Process Classification Framework (PCF) [2] and the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) [6].

The SAP Solution Manager of SAP NetWeaver [18] provides configurable reference models for business scenarios. Their usage ensures the quality of the IT solution and enables traceability of all changes, thus ensuring compliance with organizational needs. Most ERP vendors have similar approaches to support the configuration and implementation procedure of an IS landscape.

**3. Methodology to Analyze Compliance**
Based on our experiences with business processes in the air travel industry, we devised a generic approach and methodology to analyze the compliance between processes. The methodology identifies five entities, illustrated in Figure 1, which need to be considered when measuring compliance with reference models: the meta reference model \(M_0\), the adopted reference model \(M_1\), the to-be process model \(M_2\), the instances of a process model \(M_2\), and the as-is process model \(M_3\).

Depending on the scope, a meta reference model \(M_0\) may provide either generally accepted processes or a set of abstract guidelines. In both cases, and particularly in the latter case, the reference model \(M_1\) needs to be adapted to the needs of an organization, yielding a set of processes \(M_2\). The execution of these processes generates a set of instances. The analysis of these instances provides an as-is process model \(M_3\), which reflects how a process \(M_2\) was executed. The level of compliance can be measured by analyzing process models \(M_0\), \(M_1\), \(M_2\), and \(M_3\). Since \(M_0\) is generally specified in natural language, our study will focus on analyzing models \(M_1\), \(M_2\), and \(M_3\).

Models \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) are mainly constructed manually, whereas \(M_3\) is usually inferred from log files. These log files serve as a starting point for process mining algorithms, which aim at the automatic extraction of process knowledge. Various algorithms [1, 17] have been developed and implemented in ProM [16] to discover different types of process models, such as Petri nets [22] or Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs) [26]. ProM is a process mining workbench offering algorithms to discover and verify process models [26].

The level of compliance is expressed by a quality indicator, which can be incorporated into a maturity model, e.g., the COBIT maturity model "Manage Service Desk and Incidents" [21]. Such a model classifies the degree to which a process is aligned with a reference process. The level of compliance measured by the comparison of model \(M_2\) or \(M_3\) with \(M_1\) serves as an initial estimate of the as-is compliance maturity. Comparing the as-is maturity with the to-be maturity supports the identification of potential improvements and contributes to determining alternative actions.

**4. Requirements for a Compliance Analysis**
We define process compliance as the degree to which a process model behaves in accordance with a reference model. The behavior is expressed by the instances generated by the model.

Figure 2 shows two EPCs capturing similar functionalities, both taken from the complaint handling process of a German passenger airline. The process is supported by the application "Interaction Center" (IAC) of the SAP Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The IAC facilitates the processing of interactions between business partners. Each interaction is registered as an activity. Besides a complaint description, further information, such as associated documents (e.g., e-mails), may be related to activities. Based on the characteristics of a complaint, an activity of the categories "Cust. Relations" or "Cust. Payment" is established. For example, complaints associated with payments are processed by the "Cust. Payment" department.

The EPC in the center of the figure shows model \(M_1\), which depicts three activities: Create Incident, Categorize Incident, and Prioritize Incident. The EPC on the right-hand side of the figure shows model \(M_2\). Processing starts with an incoming complaint. Customers can complain by sending an e-mail or by filling out an online form. In the latter case, the customer has to classify the complaint. In the former case, an employee has to read the e-mail to understand the complaint and determine the category manually. To measure the compliance, we need to discuss the characteristics of business and reference models.

**Compliance Maturity and Degree:**
Our case study identified two major concerns when evaluating compliance with reference models. First, the passenger airline wanted to learn if its processes followed the behavior recommended by the reference model. Second, the airline wanted to inquire if all the behavior recommended by the reference model was being implemented. In the context of compliance, we refer to the former as compliance degree and the latter as compliance maturity. Let us consider the processing of incoming customer complaints. Model \(M_1\) may recommend accepting complaints in a specific manner, while the actual process \(M_2\) might follow a different but equally effective method.
