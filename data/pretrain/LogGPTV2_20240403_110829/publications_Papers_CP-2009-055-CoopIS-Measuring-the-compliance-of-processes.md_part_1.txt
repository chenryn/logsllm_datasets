Abstract. Reference models provide a set of generally accepted best
practicestocreateefficientprocessestobedeployedinsideorganizations.
However, a central challenge is to determine how these best practices
are implemented in practice. One limitation of existing approaches for
measuringcompliance istheassumption thatthecompliance canbede-
terminedusingthenotionofprocessequivalence.Nonetheless,theuseof
equivalencealgorithmsisnotadequatesincetwomodelscanhavediffer-

paper presents a new approach and algorithm which allow to measure
the compliance of process models with reference models. We evaluate
ourapproachbymeasuringthecomplianceofamodelcurrentlyusedby
a German passenger airline with the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL)
reference model and bycomparing our resultswith existing approaches.
1 Introduction
Referencemodelshavegainedincreasingattention,becausetheymakeasubstan-
tialcontributiontodesignandexecuteprocessesefficiently.Obviously,reference
models are useful, but to which extent are these best practices adopted and im-
plemented in a specific business context? Process mining algorithms [1,17] have
shown a considerable potential for assessing the compliance of instances with
reference models. The instances are typically recorded by process-aware IS and
serve as a starting point for reconstructing an as-is process model. The derived
modelcanbe comparedwithothermodels(e.g.referencemodels)usingexisting

a former compliance analysis using process mining and equivalence algorithms
arenotsufficient [11].Our previousstudies haveevaluatedthe compliance ofan
as-is process model of a passenger airline with a reference model, which had in-

does not only resultin log files but it also results in written recordfiles, manual
activities as well as human knowledge. Information outside the reach of process
mining algorithmsmay compromise the results of compliance.Finally, reference
models typically do not state whether dependencies between activities are com-
pulsory.Duringourformerstudies[11]oncomplianceusingexistingequivalence
algorithms, we have changed the order of activities in a reference model. While
the compliance should remain the same since the reference model did not en-
force a specific order for the execution of the activities, the compliance yielded
different results.
This paper motivates the reader for the importance of measuring the com-
pliance of process models with reference models. We also discuss the differences
between process equivalence and process compliance and argue for the need of
specific algorithmsto measurethe compliance betweenprocesses.We show that
two models can have different structures but one process can still be compliant
withthe other.Furthermore,we developanew approachandalgorithmto over-
come the drawbacks identified. We measure the compliance of an as-is process
model of a German passenger airline with a reference model. To validate our
methodology, we compare our compliance results with two existing approaches
andexplainwhycurrentalgorithmsarenotsuitable toevaluatethe compliance.
The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the
fundamentals of reference models. Section 3 explains our methodology to mea-
sure compliance. The following section investigates the requirements for deter-
mining compliance. Sect. 5 presents and evaluates our rational and concept to
developanewalgorithm.Sect.6describesthemainrelatedwork.Finally,Sect.7
formulates our conclusions based on our findings.
2 The Importance of Reference Models
Referencemodelsofferasetofgenerallyacceptedprocesseswhicharesoundand
efficient. Their adoption is generally motivated by the following reasons. First,
they significantly speed up the design of process models by providing reusable
and high quality content. Second, they optimize the design as they have been
developedovera longperiodandusually capturethe businessinsightofexperts
[25].Third,theyeasethecompliancewithindustryregulationsandrequirements
and, thus, mitigate risk. Fourth, they are an essential mean to create a link
between the business needs and IT implementations [25].

the focus of this paper is on the first class of models, we explain both classes

reference models for business scenarios. Their usage ensures quality of the IT
solution and enables traceability of all changes and, thus, compliance to the or-

3 Methodology to Analyze Compliance
Based on our experiences with business processes of the air travel industry, we
devisedagenericapproachandmethodologytoanalyzethecompliancebetween
processes.Themethodologyidentifies5entities,illustratedinFig.1,whichneed
to be considered when measuring the compliance with reference models: the
meta reference model M , the adopted reference model M , the to-be process
0 1
model M , the instances of a process model M , and the as-is process model
2 2
M . Depending on the scope, a meta reference model M may provide either
3 0
generally accepted processes or a set of abstract guidelines. In both cases, and
particularly in the latter case, the reference model M needs to be adapted to

an as-is process model M which reflects how a process M was executed. The

drivenProcessChains(EPCs)[26].ProMisaprocessminingworkbenchoffering

The level of compliance is expressed by a quality indicator, which can be
incorporated into a maturity model, e.g. the COBIT maturity model “Manage

process is aligned with a reference process. The level of compliance measured
by the comparison of model M or M with M serves as an initial estimate

of the as-is compliance maturity. Opposing the as-is maturity and the to-be
maturity supports the identification of potential improvements and contributes
to determine alternative actions.
4 Requirements for a Compliance Analysis
We define process compliance as the degree to which a process model behaves
in accordance to a reference model. The behavior is expressed by the instances,
which can be generated by the model.
Figure 2 shows two EPCs capturing similar functionalities. Both are taken
fromthe complainthandlingprocessofaGermanpassengerairline.Theprocess
issupportedbytheapplication“InteractionCenter”(IAC)oftheSAPCustomer
RelationshipManagement(CRM) system. The IAC facilitates the processing of
interactions between business partners. Each interaction is registered as an ac-
tivity. Besides a complaint description, further information, such as associated
documents (e.g. e-mails), may be related to activities. Based on the character-
istics of a complaint, an activity of the categories “Cust. Relations” or “Cust.
Payment”is established.For example,complaints associatedwithpayments are
processed by the “Cust. Payment” department.
The EPC in the center of the figure shows model M , which depicts three
1
activities:Createincident,Categorizeincident,andPrioritizeincident.TheEPC
on the right-hand side of the figure shows model M . Processing starts with an

incoming complaint. Customers can complain by sending an e-mail or by filling
anonline form.In the latter case,the customerhas to classify the complaint.In
theformercase,anemployeehastoreadthee-mailtounderstandthecomplaint
and determine the category manually. To measure the compliance, we need to
discuss characteristics of business and reference models.

ComplianceMaturityandDegree. Ourcasestudyhasidentifiedtwomajor
concerns when it comes to evaluating compliance with reference models. First,
the passenger airline wanted to learn if its processes followed the behavior rec-
ommended by the reference model. Second, the airline wanted to inquire if all
the behavior recommended by the reference model was being implemented. In
the context of compliance, we refer to the former as compliance degree and we
denote the latter as compliance maturity. Let us consider the processing of in-
coming customer complaints. Model M may recommend accepting complaints
