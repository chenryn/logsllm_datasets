that they can be applied for anomaly detection. An ideal metric should have
low variation, which helps reduce false alarm rates. As human behaviors such as
lunch and shopping often exhibit temporal periodicity, a natural hypothesis is
that SMS user behaviors should follow similar patterns. To verify this, we depict
in Figure 4 the average number of messages sent out per day and per week by
each persistent user versus his overall rank. Note that the x-axis, which indicates
the user rank, is shown in logarithmic scale. For each persistent user in the
graphs, we also show the range between the mean plus and minus one standard
deviation. Clearly, these graphs reveal that both daily and weekly numbers of
messages sent by persistent users exhibit high variation for many users.
A better way of quantifying the variation of a statistic metric is Coeﬃcient
of Variation (COV), deﬁned as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean.
Generally speaking, a distribution with COV  1 are considered high variation. Among all the persistent
users, 97.7% and 71.9% of them have COVs > 1 for the daily and weekly number
of short messages they sent, respectively, suggesting that neither of these two
metrics is good for anomaly detection.

We perform a similar analysis on the daily and weekly number of unique
recipients to whom persistent users sent their short messages, and the results are
provided in Figure 5. We observe that 94.4% and 54.4% of persistent users have
COVs > 1 for their daily and weekly number of unique recipients, respectively.
Hence, they are not good candidates for anomaly detection either.
pi × log2
We further analyze the entropy of the distribution of the number of short
messages sent to each unique recipient for every persistent SMS user. The en-
tropy, H, is deﬁned as: H = − (cid:2)
pi, where pi is the fraction of short
messages sent to the i-th unique recipient in a day or a week (suppose that there
are n unique recipients). Figure 6 shows the average daily and weekly entropies
for each persistent SMS user. Similar to the other metrics that we have studied,
these two also show high variation: 98.0% and 66.9% of persistent users have
COVs > 1 for their daily and weekly entropies, respectively. Therefore, neither
metric seems plausible for anomaly detection.

Window-based behaviors of SMS users. The above analysis reveals that
high variation is inherent in many SMS users’ behaviors on a temporally periodic
basis. We now examine their behaviors from a window-based perspective. For
each SMS user in the dataset, we form m blocks, each of which contains an equal
number of successive short messages. Given the sequence of blocks from the same
SMS sender, we ﬁrst consider the number of unique recipients to whom messages
in each block are sent. Similar to our previous analysis, we are interested in the
variation of this metric. To ensure that there are enough short messages in each
block, we consider only users that have sent at least θ short messages. In our
study, we consider two θ values, 100 and 200, which lead to a set of 353 and 167
qualiﬁed SMS users, respectively.
Figure 7 gives the average number of unique recipients when θ is 200 (we have
similar results for θ = 100, but due to space limitation, we do not show them
here). Diﬀerent from the metrics characterizing temporally periodic behaviors,
the number of unique recipients seen in each window seems to have low variation.
This is conﬁrmed by Table 1, which shows that the COV exceeds 1.0 for less
than 1% of the users, regardless of which θ and m are used.
For each SMS user, we also consider the entropy of the distribution of the
number of messages sent to each unique recipient within each block. Figure 8
depicts the mean for θ = 200, and Table 1 also provides the average COV in
diﬀerent combinations of θ and m. In all cases, the average COV is smaller
than 20%. It also seems that the COV can be reduced by either increasing the
threshold θ or choosing a smaller m.
These results reveal that window-based behaviors of SMS users bear lower
variation than their temporally periodic behaviors. In the following discussion,
we further explore the similarity across diﬀerent blocks for each SMS user.
Similarity measures. First, we study the similarity in the set of recipients
between diﬀerent blocks for the same SMS user. For the i-th block Bi associated
with an SMS user, we let Ri denote the entire set of unique recipients of the
short messages in this block. We use the following recipient similarity metric to

S(Ri,Rj) gives the average fraction of common elements that are shared between
sets Ri and Rj. Clearly, S(Ri,Rj) close to 0 means that Ri and Rj share few
common elements and vice versa if it is close to 1. For each SMS user, we call
set {S(Ri,Rj) : ∀i, j, i (cid:2)= j} as her recipient similarity metric set.

Figure 9 depicts the recipient similarity metrics with θ = 200. One observation
is that SMS users diﬀer signiﬁcantly on how they send messages regularly: for
some users they send short messages to almost the same set of recipients, but for
