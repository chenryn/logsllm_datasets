**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Update Software

A robust patch management process should be implemented to regularly review and update software. This process should include the following steps:

1. **Identify Unused Applications:** Regularly audit installed applications to identify and remove any that are no longer in use.
2. **Monitor Unmaintained and Previously Vulnerable Software:** Ensure that all software is actively maintained and promptly update or replace any software that is no longer supported or has known vulnerabilities.
3. **Remove Unnecessary Features, Components, Files, and Documentation:** Eliminate any unnecessary features, components, files, and documentation to reduce the attack surface and minimize potential security risks.

By following these steps, organizations can maintain a secure and up-to-date software environment, reducing the likelihood of exploitation by malicious actors.
