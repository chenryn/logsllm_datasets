### 5.1 Ecosystem

We begin by classifying poisoned search results (PSRs) into campaigns, examining how these campaigns target specific verticals, and analyzing what the PSRs reveal about the operations of these campaigns.

#### Data Collection and Classification
Over an eight-month period from November 13, 2013, to July 15, 2014, we crawled search results and detected 2.7 million PSRs across all verticals. These PSRs used 27,000 unique doorway domains and directed users to 7,404 different stores selling counterfeit luxury merchandise. Using the classifier described in Section 4.2, we identified 52 distinct SEO campaigns responsible for 828 stores, 11,000 doorway domains, and 1.6 million PSRs. Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown of these campaigns, including their names (derived from URL patterns, C&C domain names, or other operational characteristics), the number of doorway domains, storefronts, and targeted brands.

Notably, while 58% of all PSRs were attributed to these campaigns, they only accounted for 11% of all stores. This disparity indicates a skewed distribution where a few large campaigns dominate the majority of PSRs, redirecting users to a concentrated set of storefronts.

#### Brand Perspective
From the perspective of brands, we found that 16% to 69% of PSRs in each vertical could be attributed to known campaigns. Figure 2 visualizes our classification results for four diverse verticals: Abercrombie (64.2% of PSRs classified to campaigns), Beats By Dre (62.2%), Louis Vuitton (66%), and Uggs (58%). These verticals were chosen for their variety in merchandise, campaigns, and search term selection methodologies. The stacked area plots in Figure 2 show the fraction of search results poisoned by major campaigns targeting each vertical, with the "misc" label consolidating multiple campaigns to reduce clutter.

Each graph in Figure 2 presents the daily detection, classification, and penalization of PSRs over time. For example, on December 1, 2013, 34.6% of search results for the Beats By Dre vertical were poisoned. Of these, 85.3% redirected users to counterfeit stores operated by five campaigns: KEY (16.8%), NEWSORG (53.8%), MOONKIS (5.8%), JSUS (8.0%), and PAULSIMON (0.3%). The remaining 14.7% of PSRs redirected users to unclassified counterfeit stores. The bottom shaded area in the graph shows that only 0.6% of PSRs were penalized, either through Google labeling them as "hacked" (Section 5.2.2) or a brand seizing the storefront domain name (Section 5.3).

#### Verticals Analysis
Figure 3 illustrates the percentage of poisoned search results for each vertical using sparklines. Each sparkline is a time series showing relative values over a five-month period at a daily granularity. The left number represents the minimum value, and the right number (also shown as dots on the line) represents the maximum. Each column of lines shows the percentage of PSRs among the top 10 (left) and top 100 (right) search results. For instance, in the Abercrombie vertical, at most 13% of the top 10 search results were poisoned, while at least 2% were poisoned. The sparkline indicates that the first three months had higher poisoning rates, which decreased in the latter five months.

Overall, heavily targeted verticals are particularly vulnerable to poisoned search results. In 13 out of 16 verticals, approximately 5% of search results were poisoned at some point. However, for the five most vulnerable verticals, 31-42% of the top 100 search results were poisoned at various times. As expected, it is generally easier to poison search results outside the top 10. For example, Beats By Dre had up to 23% of its top 10 results poisoned, while 37% of its top 100 results were poisoned at one point.

Brands face multiple adversaries. Whether targeted by many campaigns (14 and 17 for Louis Vuitton and Uggs, respectively) or just a few (three and six for Abercrombie and Beats By Dre), all verticals are targeted by multiple campaigns competing to SEO their doorway pages into search results to lure customers to their counterfeit goods.

#### SEO Campaigns
SEO campaigns employ significant infrastructure to maintain their operations. As shown in Table 2, these campaigns use hundreds to thousands of doorway sites to redirect users to dozens of storefronts, similar in scale to other abusive SEO botnets [36]. Interestingly, there is no strong correlation between the number of doorway sites and the number of storefronts or targeted brands.
