5.1 Ecosystem
We start with classifying poisoned search results into campaigns,
how those campaigns target verticals, and what the PSRs reveal
about the operations of the campaigns.
In terms of raw data, we crawled search results for eight months
from November 13, 2013 through July 15, 2014 and detected 2.7M
PSRs, across all verticals, using 27K doorways from unique do-
mains and sending users to 7,404 different stores selling counter-
feit luxury merchandise. Applying the classiﬁer described in Sec-
tion 4.2 to this data, we identiﬁed 52 distinct SEO campaigns that
account for 828 stores, 11K doorway domains, and 1.6M PSRs.
Table 2 lists the campaigns using a name we derived from a pat-
tern in their URLs, the domain names used for their C&C, or some
other telltale aspect of their operation. For each campaign, the table
lists the number of doorway domains, storefronts, and brands tar-
geted. Note that, although we ascribed more than half (58%) of all
PSRs to their respective campaigns, these PSRs only account for
11% of all stores. This disparity suggests that the ecosystem has
a skewed distribution where a handful of large campaigns account
for the majority share of PSRs that redirect users to a concentrated
set of storefronts.
From the perspective of brands, we attributed 16% to 69% of
PSRs in each vertical to known campaigns. Figure 2 visualizes
our classiﬁcation results for four verticals: Abercrombie (64.2% of
PSRs classiﬁed to campaigns), Beats By Dre (62.2%), Louis Vuit-
ton (66%), and Uggs (58%). We chose these verticals for their di-
versity in merchandise, campaigns, and search term selection meth-
odology. For each vertical, the ﬁlled areas in the stacked area plots
show the fraction of search results poisoned by the major cam-
paigns targeting the vertical; note that the “misc” label collapses
multiple campaigns into a single category to reduce clutter.
Each graph presents the PSRs detected, classiﬁed, and penalized
over time at the granularity of a day. For example, in Figure 2b
on December 1, 2013, 34.6% of search results for the Beats By
Dre vertical were poisoned. Of these PSRs, 85.3% redirect users to
counterfeit stores operated by ﬁve campaigns: KEY (16.8%), NEW-
SORG (53.8%), MOONKIS (5.8%), JSUS (8.0%), and PAULSIMON
(0.3%). The remaining 14.7% PSRs redirect users to counterfeit
stores we have yet to classify. The bottom shaded area shows that
just 0.6% are penalized either through Google labeling the search
result as “hacked” (Section 5.2.2) or a brand has seized the store-
front domain name (Section 5.3).
5.1.1 Verticals
Figure 3 shows the percentage of search results that were poi-
soned for each vertical as pairs of sparklines. Each sparkline is a
time series showing relative values over the ﬁve-month time span
of the study at the granularity of days. The left number is the min-
imum value across time and the right is the maximum (also shown
as dots on the line). Each column of lines shows the percentage
of PSRs among top 10 search results (left) or top 100 (right). For
example, in the Abercrombie vertical in the top left, at most 13%
of the top 10 search results in the vertical were poisoned, while at
least 2% were poisoned. The sparkline shows that the ﬁrst three
months were closer to the 13%, while the latter ﬁve months were
much lower.
Figure 3: Percentage of search results poisoned for each brand ver-
tical, shown as sparklines. Each sparkline is a daily time series
showing relative values over ﬁve months. The left number is the
minimum value across time and the right is the maximum (also
shown as dots on the line).
Overall, heavily targeted verticals are particularly vulnerable to
poisoned search results.
In 13 out of 16 verticals, about 5% of
search results are poisoned at some point in time. But for the ﬁve
verticals most vulnerable to search poisoning, at different points in
time 31–42% of the top 100 search results in those verticals were
poisoned. Also, as expected, it is easier in general to poison search
results from outside the top 10; Beats By Dre, for instance, had at
most 23% of its top 10 results poisoned while at one point 37% of
its top 100 results were poisoned.
Brands face multiple “adversaries”. Whether targeted by many
campaigns (14 and 17 for Louis Vuitton and Uggs, respectively) or
just a few (three and six for Abercrombie and Beats By Dre), all
verticals are targeted by multiple campaigns all competing to SEO
their doorway pages into search results to lure customers for their
counterfeit goods.
SEO Campaigns
5.1.2
SEO campaigns employ considerable infrastructure to maintain
their businesses. As shown in Table 2, SEO campaigns use hun-
dreds to thousands of doorway sites to redirect users to dozens of
storefronts (similar in scale to other abusive SEO botnets [36]). In-
terestingly, we do not ﬁnd a strong correlation between the num-
