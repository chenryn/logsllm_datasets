The link labeled "View the latest version here" in the 1.0 documentation should direct users to the corresponding page in the 1.1 version, if such a page exists. Currently, this link only redirects to the root documentation page (http://kubernetes.io/docs). 

To improve user experience and ensure that visitors can easily access the most up-to-date information, it is recommended that this hyperlink be updated to point to the 1.1 version of the specific document. If the 1.1 version of the page does not exist, then maintaining the current behavior of redirecting to the main documentation page would be acceptable.
