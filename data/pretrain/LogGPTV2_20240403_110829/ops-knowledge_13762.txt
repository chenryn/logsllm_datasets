The following are suggestions for backing up and restoring key server data: Step 1: Determine responsibilities Professional and scientific handling. In addition, a server backup policy should also be formulated, specifying who will perform it, the frequency of regular backups, and the data to be backed up.

Step 4: Test the backup After the backup is completed, a test is required to ensure that the data can be restored successfully. Test backups are necessary in case a backup fails or data recovery is incomplete.

Before restoring data, you need to ensure that the backup files are complete, and the backup files can be opened and read normally. Ways to restore data include reinstalling the operating system, restoring disk images, or rewriting log files, etc.
