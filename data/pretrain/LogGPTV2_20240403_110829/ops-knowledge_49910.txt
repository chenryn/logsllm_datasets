User: I have a program without documentation. I am wondering if there is a way to discover if it has any interface for interprocess communication. Are there any tools that search through an executable to discover such interfaces? I am interested in learning anything about such a program, like if it supports any command line options or arguments, or whatever else may be discoverable.
I primarily use Linux, and some of the programs I would like to interface with are Windows programs running via wine. I program in C and C++, and some Python.
A related question; is there a way to programmatically simulate clicking a button in some other window on the computer screen?
Assistant: Some Windows Programs use DCOM for interprocess-communication. There are some few programs to extract this interface from DLL- and EXE-Files.
Otherwise you have to disassemble the program, and look at the code directly, which is non-trival.
For your last question:
Windows programs use a message system to communicate with the GUI. You can use sendmessage to simulate any message, such as clicking a button.
