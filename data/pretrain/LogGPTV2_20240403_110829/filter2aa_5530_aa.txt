# Exploitation Tools
`Exploitation` is probably one of the most glamorous parts of a penetration test, yet it is often done with brute force rather than with precision. An exploit should be performed only when you know almost beyond a shadow of a doubt that a particular exploit will be successful. Of course, unforeseen protective measures might be in place on the target that prevent a particular exploit from working—but before you trigger a vulnerability, you should know that the system is vulnerable. Blindly firing off a mass onslaught of exploits and praying for a shell isn’t productive; it is noisy and provides little if any value to you as a penetration tester or to your client. Do your homework first, and then launch well-researched exploits that are likely to succeed.
