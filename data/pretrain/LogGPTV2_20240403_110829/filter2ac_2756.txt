### Title: The Ripple Effect: Building a Diverse Security Research Team

**Abstract:**

Building a diverse and inclusive team that is a joy to work in is no small feat. It requires time, dedication, and a commitment to continuous improvement. Despite the industry's often dismal statistics on gender equality and representation, we have successfully established a thriving, diverse team of security researchers with equal gender representation. Our core team is free from misogyny, sexism, and any form of toxic culture. However, our journey began with an all-male team, highlighting an unconscious bias that needed to be addressed.

In this presentation, we will share our experience in identifying and measuring this bias, and the steps we took to increase female representation from 0% to 50%. According to the Global Gender Gap Report 2020 by the World Economic Forum, it will take more than 100 years for women to achieve gender equality. This timeline is unacceptable, and we believe that we can and must accelerate this change.

Our goal is to provide practical tools and strategies to allies attending Black Hat, enabling them to drive similar changes within their own teams. These tools are not only effective in creating a more inclusive environment but have also enhanced the overall atmosphere and productivity of our R&D team.
