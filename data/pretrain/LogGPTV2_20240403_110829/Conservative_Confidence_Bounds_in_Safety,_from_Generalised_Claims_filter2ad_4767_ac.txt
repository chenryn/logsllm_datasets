where the inequality is due to precaution (b) above. Thus, one
can claim, as in case 3, that no matter what the true value of

5) the same scenario as in 4), but the testing environment is
made stressful by exaggerating the frequency of demand types
that are understood to be more likely to be affected by software
design faults: experience with previous systems indicates that
the pfd tends to be higher for those classes of demands. So,
we could reuse equation (3) but replacing the qi, seen now as
random variables, with their expected values. Therefore, pfd A
and pfd B must also be replaced by their expected values, and
the inequality about which the CII claim is made becomes
E[pfd B] (cid:54) E[pfd A].
6) A and B are operational environments for a COTS
system (e.g. an industrial PLC) which was developed for
non-critical applications, hence has little formal evidence to
prove its dependability, but has been operated extensively in
A, proving very reliable. Environment B presents fewer of the
input sequences that are generally known to be “stressful” for
this category of products. It is also known that the system
has been used in other environments and never been reported
to be especially unreliable. Hence, there is conﬁdence that
the system will be at least as reliable in B as it was in A;
however with some small but non-negligible probability that
it will prove less reliable, possibly seriously so. The CII claim
that is supported is thus the same as in example 1.
V. CONSERVATIVE CONFIDENCE BOUNDS ON PFD
In this section, we model dependability arguments that
incorporate GALE/PIU evidence. In particular, we extend
CBI methods to derive conservative conﬁdence bounds on a
system’s pfd, for on-demand systems.
For brevity, we talk about “versions” A and B, irrespective
of whether our scenario is 1) system B is a newer version
of system A and both operate in identical environments, with
GALE evidence gathered from both A and B, or 2) the same
system is required to operate in a new environment B different
from a previous environment A (so PIU evidence is gathered
from the system in environment A).
Failures of A and B occur according to independent
Bernoulli processes. Let XA, XB be the unknown pfds for

versions A and B, with an unknown joint prior distribution of
(cid:104)XA, XB(cid:105). Joint prior distributions of (cid:104)XA, XB(cid:105) are depicted
in Fig.s 2-5. On the Cartesian plane of (xA, xB) values, each
ﬁgure depicts the partition of the distribution’s domain induced
by constraints on the distribution (“prior knowledge”), and
probability masses associated with subsets and limit points.
After observing nA, nB failure-free runs of A and B, one
may compute conservative posterior conﬁdence in a claim
[XB (cid:54) p] for some required bound p. The Bernoulli processes
imply a likelihood function L(x, y) = (1 − x)nA(1 − y)nB .
We seek conservative values of
P (XB (cid:54) p | nA, nB) =
E[ L(XA, XB)1XB(cid:54)p ]
(4)
E[ L(XA, XB) ]
subject to the prior knowledge an assessor possesses. For all of
the scenarios we will consider, prior knowledge 1 applies – i.e.
certainty that XA and XB cannot be better than some pl. Prior
knowledge 2 (i.e. having θ × 100% conﬁdence a version is no
worse than target pfd ε) may apply to one or both versions.
In addition, evidence may also support one of the following:

supports (a) PK 2 for only version A, or (b) PK 2 for both versions
(for the parameter ranges given in the respective subcaptions).
Proposition 2 generalises a result in [11]. Its proof mirrors
those for propositions 3 and 4 below, outlined in [24].
Proposition 2. Consider the optimization problem
infD P (XB (cid:54) p | nA, nB)
(where ε (cid:54) p), subject to the constraints that there is evidence:
1) A and B satisfy PK 1, 3, with α = 1 and φ > 1 − θ;
2) either A alone, or A and B, satisfy PK 2.
The prior distributions in Fig.s 3a and 3b solve this problem
for certain parameter ranges of the constraints.
Here, the assessor believes P (XB (cid:54) XA) = φ; this is what
(5) means when α = 1. Fig.s 3a and 3b represent cases when
this conﬁdence φ is high: i.e. φ > θ and φ > 1 − θ . Due to
this strong CII, these priors (out of all that solve proposition
2) give greatest posterior conﬁdence in [XB (cid:54) p].
The following two propositions are novel (proofs in [24]).

VI. NUMERICAL ILLUSTRATIONS
The conservative claims derived in Sec. V can be applied
in scenarios with evidence to support the related PKs. These
claims are summarised as formulae in the last column of table
I. Each formula is P (XB  θ, ε  θ, p  θ > 1 − θ and give the greatest
posterior conﬁdence among the priors in Fig. 4. Note that 4b,
4c and 4d all possess B-version marginal distributions identical
to the single-system CBI prior of proposition 1 (i.e. Fig. 1).
