User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows that the kernel is logging information about total interrupts, critical input interrupts, and the rbs signal handler. The log indicates that there were no critical input interrupts and that the maximum time for a single instance of a correctable ddr was 0 microseconds. The total number of interrupts ranged from 10616 to 10754.
