### Evaluation of Performance and Parameter Impact

We selected 100 trajectories from 100 users, each containing 500 timestamps, to evaluate the overall performance and the impact of parameters. The default values for the parameters are \( \varepsilon = 1 \) and \( \delta = 0.01 \) unless otherwise specified. The average performances for both datasets are reported in Figures 7 (on GeoLife data with popular M), Figure 8 (on GeoLife data with personal M), and Figure 9 (on Gowalla data with popular M).

#### Size of \(\Delta X\) vs. \(\varepsilon\)

- **GeoLife Data (Figures 7a and 8a)**: The size of \(\Delta X\) decreases with larger \(\varepsilon\) because the inference result is enhanced by a higher \(\varepsilon\).
- **Gowalla Data (Figure 9a)**: The impact of \(\varepsilon\) is negligible due to the limited predictability of one-step transitions in the Markov model (check-ins are infrequent).

#### Size of \(\Delta X\) vs. \(\delta\)

- **General Observation (Figures 7b, 8b, and 9b)**: The size of \(\Delta X\) is primarily determined by \(\delta\). Both LM and PIM have similar sizes of \(\Delta X\), indicating that the true location is hidden among a similar number of candidates.
- **Impact of Increasing \(\delta\)**: As \(\delta\) increases, the size of \(\Delta X\) reduces dramatically because more improbable locations are truncated. However, \(\delta\) cannot be too large, as it would preserve almost no privacy if the size of \(\Delta X\) is close to 1. Therefore, we use \(\delta = 0.01\) by default, which ensures that the sizes of \(\Delta X\) are greater than 4 in all three settings.

#### Drift Ratio vs. \(\varepsilon\)

- **GeoLife Data (Figures 7c and 9c)**: The drift ratio decreases with larger \(\varepsilon\) because a higher \(\varepsilon\) provides more accurate release.
- **GeoLife Data with Personal M (Figure 8c)**: The impact of \(\varepsilon\) is less noticeable because the size of \(\Delta X\) is already small (as shown in Figure 8b). Thus, increasing \(\varepsilon\) does not significantly improve the accuracy of the inference.

#### Drift Ratio vs. \(\delta\)

- **General Observation (Figures 7d, 8d, and 9d)**: The drift ratio increases with larger \(\delta\) due to the reduced \(\Delta X\). PIM performs slightly better than LM.
- **Phenomenon of "Lagged Catch-Up"**: Despite the increase in drift ratio, the accuracy of the released locations still improves with increasing \(\delta\).

#### Distance vs. \(\varepsilon\)

- **General Observation (Figures 7e, 8e, and 9e)**: PIM outperforms LM in terms of distance. In Gowalla data, the distance is larger due to the greater separation between check-in locations compared to GeoLife data.

#### Distance vs. \(\delta\)

- **General Observation (Figures 7f, 8f, and 9f)**: As \(\delta\) increases, the distance decreases because fewer candidates are included in the \(\delta\)-location set. PIM achieves better accuracy than LM. However, from \(10^{-1.5}\) to \(10^{-1}\), the improvement in distance is minimal while the privacy guarantee drops significantly (as shown in Figures 7b, 8b, and 9b). Notably, in Figure 8b, the size of \(\Delta X\) is 1 when \(\delta = 0.1\). Therefore, choosing a high value of \(\delta\) (like \(\delta > 0.03\)) does not provide the best trade-off between privacy and utility.

### Impact of Markov Model

- **Comparison (Figures 7 and 8)**: The impact of different Markov models is evident. A more accurate (personal) model leads to better utility, including a smaller size of \(\Delta X\), lower drift ratio, and less distance. However, the same level of \(\varepsilon\)-differential privacy is maintained regardless of the Markov model used.

### Utility for Location-Based Queries

To demonstrate the utility of the released locations, we measured the precision and recall of kNN queries at each of the 500 timestamps in the 100 trajectories with popular M. The average results of kNN from original locations and k'NN from released locations are reported in Figure 10 with \(\varepsilon = 1\) and \(\delta = 0.01\).

- **Precision and Recall (k = k') (Figures 10a and 10b)**: Precision equals recall. As \(k\) increases, precision and recall also increase because the nearest neighbors are found in larger areas. PIM consistently outperforms LM.
- **Precision (Fixed k = 5, Varying k') (Figures 10c and 10d)**: Precision decreases as \(k'\) increases due to a larger returned set.
- **Recall (Fixed k = 5, Varying k') (Figures 10e and 10f)**: Recall increases with larger \(k'\). Overall, PIM has better precision and recall than LM.

### Related Works

#### Location Privacy

- **Literature Review**: There is extensive literature on location privacy. Recent books and surveys [23, 15] provide up-to-date reviews of Location Privacy Preserving Mechanisms (LPPMs).
- **Obfuscation Methods**: LPPMs typically use obfuscation methods such as spatial cloaking, cell merging, location precision reduction, or dummy cells to achieve anonymity-based or uncertainty-based privacy. However, these methods do not always provide sufficient privacy protection [22, 37].
- **Temporal Correlations**: Most LPPMs do not consider temporal correlations between locations and are vulnerable to various inference attacks. Recent work [1] proposed geo-indistinguishability, an extension of differential privacy, but it does not account for temporal correlations of multiple locations.
- **Markov Models**: Several works use Markov models to model user mobility and infer user locations or trajectories [25, 34]. [17] proposed a technique with provable privacy guarantees to filter user context streams, even against adversaries with knowledge of temporal correlations, using suppression instead of perturbation. [37] quantified the privacy of existing LPPMs, assuming adversaries can model user mobility using a Markov chain learned from a population.

#### Differential Privacy

- **Variants and Generalizations**: Various variants and generalizations of differential privacy have been studied, as discussed in Section 3.4. However, applying differential privacy for location protection has not been extensively explored.
- **Aggregate Information**: Recent works have applied differential privacy to publish aggregate information from large volumes of location, trajectory, or spatiotemporal data [6, 33, 12, 24]. Our contribution extends differential privacy to a new setting of continual location sharing for a single user with temporally correlated locations.
- **Optimal Query Answering**: Hardt and Talwar [18] studied the theoretical lower bound for differentially private mechanisms and proposed the K-norm mechanism. Bhaskara et al. [4] and Nikolov et al. [30] further improved the efficiency of the K-norm mechanism. We extended the K-norm mechanism to location data by examining the two-dimensional sensitivity hull and designing its isotropic transformation to achieve optimal utility.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed \(\delta\)-location set-based differential privacy to protect a user's true location at every timestamp under temporal correlations. We generalized the notion of "neighboring databases" to \(\delta\)-location sets and extended the well-known \(\ell_1\)-norm sensitivity to a sensitivity hull to capture the geometric meaning of sensitivity. With the sensitivity hull, we derived the lower bound of \(\delta\)-location set-based differential privacy and designed the optimal planar isotropic mechanism to release differentially private locations with high efficiency and utility.

The framework of \(\delta\)-location set-based differential privacy can work with any mobility models (besides Markov chains). Future work will focus on instantiating the framework with different and more advanced mobility models and studying their impact.
