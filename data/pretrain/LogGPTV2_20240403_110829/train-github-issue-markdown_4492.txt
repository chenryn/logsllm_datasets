I have one form type (extending `AbstractType`) which has an option to switch
between adding children either as regular fields or as hidden ones. Two
instances of that type are created in the controller, one with regular fields,
one with hidden ones. Both instances are passed to the template. The form with
hidden fields is rendered first, then the other one.
That used to work well. But with #4918, the 2nd form isn't rendered at all. I
couldn't find out why, as `isRendered()` still returns `false` prior to being
rendered and it also `has()` all expected fields. Both forms would also be
rendered correctly when changing their order.
@bschussek: Do you have a clue what could cause this? Or shall I provide some
of the code mentioned?
