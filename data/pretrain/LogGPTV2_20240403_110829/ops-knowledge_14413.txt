User: Actually I'm trying to read out the version of my cc1plus executable in windows. This is a rather simple job: 
cc1plus -version
I need this for a scons script (Tool), to integrate an ARM cross compiler. Because of that I directly call cc1plus instead of using some compiler driver. There is no useful compiler driver available.
Back to my problem: When I'm calling "cc1plus -version" on cmd I get a version string back, but cc1plus isn't terminated. Instead it is continuously executed. I have to kill cc1plus with CRTL+D. For my script this is a problem.
In the following a snippet of my cmd:
C:\DevTools\CrossWorks_for_ARM_2.3\bin>cc1plus -version
GNU C++ (GCC) version 4.7.3 20121207 (release) [ARM/embedded-4_7-branch revision 194305] (arm-unknown-eabi)
        compiled by GNU C version 3.4.4 (mingw special), GMP version 4.3.2, MPFR version 2.4.2, MPC version 0.8.1
GGC heuristics: --param ggc-min-expand=100 --param ggc-min-heapsize=131072
^C
C:\DevTools\CrossWorks_for_ARM_2.3\bin>
Is there any trick to terminate cc1plus after retrieving the version? For me it is rather incomprehensible why cc1plus isn't terminating.
Assistant: You might want to give it something to compile. Maybe be redirecting input from null: (not sure if that's correct for windows). Though if so, that looks like a moderately strange compiler
