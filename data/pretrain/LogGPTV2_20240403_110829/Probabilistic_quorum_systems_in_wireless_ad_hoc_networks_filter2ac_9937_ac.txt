Fraction of Failed Nodes
Figure 3. The degradation of the intersection probability as
a function of the f - the fraction of crashed nodes. c is the
initial non-intersection probability.
Figure 3 illustrates the evolution of the intersection proba(cid:173)
bility as a function of the number of failures. It can be seen
that a bi-quorum system can withstand failures of a linear
fraction of nodes. When starting with an initial intersection
probability of 0.95, after a failure of 30% of the nodes, the in(cid:173)
tersection probability deteriorates to only slightly above 0.9.
Handling Dynamism. There are two sources of dynamism in
ad hoc networks. The first is chum, caused by nodes arrivals,
departures, and failures, while the second is mobility. The
main problem that can be caused by chum is that due to nodes'
failures and departures, the intersection probability with old
quorum accesses degrades, as analyzed above.
Unlike deterministic quorum systems, in probabilistic quo(cid:173)
rums, there is no need to reconfigure the system after fail(cid:173)
ures in order to ensure quorum liveness. All that is needed
is to refresh the quorum system, e.g., by re-advertising every
data item to ensure data continuity. The frequency of this re(cid:173)
advertising is determined by the degradation rate. Consider
an example in Figure 3. Suppose the minimum accepted in(cid:173)
tersection probability of a given system is 0.9, the intersection
probability when there are no failures is 0.95, and the time it
takes 30% of the nodes to crash is one day. Then in this ex(cid:173)
ample, every data item should be refreshed once a day.
If mobility maintains the uniformly random distribution of
nodes, then it does not impact the intersection probability.
However, if the mobility substantially skews the structure of
the network, then refreshing by re-advertising is needed. The
rate of refreshing depends on the exact mobility model.
Network Size Estimation.
In order to calculate the quorum
size in all our access strategies the number of nodes in the
network n must be known. Methods for estimating the size of
an ad hoc network were discussed, e.g., in [5].

or lookup replies that pass through nodes can significantly re(cid:173)
duce the lookup overhead. With this optimization, and espe(cid:173)
cially when using the PATH strategy, which has an early halt(cid:173)
ing property, lookup requests for popular items can terminate
much faster and also have a higher chance of success.
Cross Layer Optimizations - RANDOM-OPT lookup
Access Strategy. Since RANDOM utilizes routing, when(cid:173)
ever a message passes through an intermediate node p, the
networking layer of this node can invoke the data location ser(cid:173)
vice to perform a local lookup. If the data is found at p, p can
respond immediately to the originator and instruct its own net(cid:173)
working layer not to forward the lookup request any further.
We denote this optimized access strategy by RANDOM-OPT.
The benefit of this approach is that on average, an intersection
can be achieved by contacting much fewer nodes. Specif(cid:173)
ically, if the advertisement used a RANDOM advertise
quorum of size Vii, then looking up in any set of Vii differ(cid:173)
ent nodes is enough to ensure intersection. Since the average
length of a random route in the network is ~, we can issue
much fewer lookup requests. However, those routes may not
necessarily pass in different nodes. As we show by simulation
in Section 7, when using the RANDOM-OPT access strategy
for lookup, we only need to invoke the lookup request to
O(1n n) random nodes instead of O(Vii) nodes.
Random Walks Optimizations.
The first RW optimiza(cid:173)
It is applicable for PATH or
tion is called path reduction.
UNIQUE-PATH lookup quorums and is used for reply mes(cid:173)
sages. Whenever a lookup RW hits an advertise quorum,
a reply is sent over the reverse path of the RW. Whenever a
reply message arrives at some node v and its next hop in the
reverse path is u, v checks if any of its neighbors w appears
on the reverse path further after u. In the affirmative, v sends
the reply message directly to w skipping u. This optimization
reduces the reply length, as demonstrated by simulations.
The second optimization utilizes the broadcasting nature
of ad hoc networks. Nodes can overhear messages, e.g., by

that hears a RW lookup request passing through one of its
neighbors v is part of the matching advertise quorum, u
can send a reply immediately to v, which will stop the RW
and send the reply back to the lookup originator. Thus, the
number of nodes covered by a RW is significantly increased.
Exploring the benefits of this technique is left for future work.
7 Simulations
Setup.
The simulations were performed using the JiST(cid:173)
/SWANS simulator3. We use the two-ray ground radio prop(cid:173)
agation model with IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol at 11Mb/sec.
The multi-hop routing protocol used for accessing RANDOM
quorum is AODV. The mobility pattern was the Random Way(cid:173)
point model with the speed of movement ranging from 0.5-2
mis, which corresponds to slow and fast walking speeds, and
an average pause time of 30s. All simulations were performed
on networks of 50, 100,200,400 and 800 nodes.
3http://jist.ece.comell.edu/
The nodes were placed at uniformly random locations in
a square area. The transmission range r was fixed for all n
at 220m. The average number of nodes in the transmission
range of any node, davg , was set to 10. This was achieved by
scaling the area size according to a2 == ~T2n and resulted in
all networks being connected (according to the connectivity
result of [17], davg should be 1fr2 n == C In n, for C > 1 and
in our case davg == 10 bounded C In n for all n's we used).
avg
Each simulation lasted for 1,000 seconds (of simulation
time) and each data point was generated as an average of 10
runs. Simulations started after a 200 seconds initialization pe(cid:173)
riod, which was enough to construct the membership informa(cid:173)
tion (in case of RANDOM quorums). Every node maintained
a membership list of random, uniformly chosen, 2Vii nodes.

In the second part 1000 lookups were performed (25 random
nodes, each making 40 lookups).
lookup quorum was ac(cid:173)
cessed by 4 different methods: RANDOM, RANDOM-OPT,
UNIQUE-PATH and FLOODING. On a hit, a node sends a
reply to the node that originated the lookup request. In case
of RANDOM and RANDOM-OPT the reply was sent using
routing, while in UNIQUE-PATH and FLOODING it was sent
over the reverse path of the lookup message, thus no routing
was used at all. Since we need to remember the RW path in
order to send the reply back, there is no reason to use PATH
(instead of UNIQUE-PATH). In all simulations, the number
of messages denotes network layer messages (e.g., one appli(cid:173)
cation message sent to a random node that traverses a route of
4 hops is counted as 4 network layer messages). Additional
routing overhead means routing specific messages, including
path establishment and maintenance messages (RREQ, RREP
and RERR in AODV). Hit ratio corresponds to the number
of successful lookup quorum accesses, that intersected with
the corresponding advertise quorum. Thus, hit ratio cor(cid:173)
responds to the intersection probability. For lack of space we
did not include the study of additional adve rt i se strategies
and the degradation rate.
RANDOM advertise with RANDOM lookup and
RANDOM-OPT lookup.
For lack of space and since
RANDOM-OPTperforms better than RANDOM, we have in(cid:173)
cluded only the RANDOM-OPT figures. Still, we would like
to mention that the behavior of RANDOM closely followed
the theoretical analysis. For example, a hit ratio of 0.9 was
achieved for a quorum size of ~ 1.3Vii, as predicted by the
analysis in Lemma 5.1. The number of messages per lookup
request behaved as I~lf:. However, routing increases the
communication overhead dramatically. This is primarily due
to new routes establishment and route maintenance of AODV.
Note that the price of establishing the routes is amortized over
different quorum accesses due to routes reuse and its relative
part drops in a longer run. However, in moving networks,
when routes break and need to be reestablished, the price of
routing stays a dominant performance factor.

Figure 4. RANDOM advertise, RANDOM-OPT lookup, Static and Mobile networks
Figure 4 depicts the performance of RANDOM-OPT
lookup access strategy. The hit ratio of 0.9 is achieved when
starting somewhat between X == In(n) and X == JIn(n)
messages to random targets. Due to the cross layer optimiza(cid:173)
tion of RANDOM-OPT, in which a local lookup is performed
in every node through which a message passes, the actual ac(cid:173)
cessed quorum size is X /f!!i, ~ vin In n. Thus, this opti(cid:173)
mization reduces the communication cost significantly com(cid:173)
pared to RANDOM. For example, in a static network of 800
nodes sending 4 lookup requests to random nodes achieves
a hit ratio of above 0.9 at the cost of less than 40 network
messages, which is exactly 1.3y'n. The routing price of
RANDOM-OPTis also much less than with RANDOM, since
it uses fewer multi-hop routes. However, the additional cost of
routing is still high, which makes this method very inefficient
compared to the UNIQUE-PATH and FLOODING strategies.
In mobile networks the hit ratio of RANDOM-OPT
lookup is only slightly smaller than the hit ratio achieved in
static networks for the same quorum size. This is since about
10% of the messages are lost due to mobility, mainly influenc(cid:173)
ing the replies. The number of messages also increases. Gen(cid:173)
erally speaking, the average path length in mobile network
tends to be longer than in static networks, mainly due to stale
neighborhood information used by routing to find routes. The
routing price in mobile networks also dramatically increases.
