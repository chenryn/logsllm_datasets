my goal is to create a browser window, have it load multiple pages (e.g.
clicking links, loading new page etc in same window) but having the ipc
available from the window on each page it loads so I can send data back to the
server process
I have a `preload` script that does `global.ELECTRON_IPC = require('ipc')` and
I have `node-integration: false` to not expose anything else
When I create a browser window and call `loadUrl`, then wait for `dom-ready`,
the `ELECTRON_IPC` variable is there
However, when I click on a link (causing the window to navigate to a new url),
and wait for `dom-ready` again, the `ELECTRON_IPC` variable is not there this
time.
I'm guessing this behavior is because preload only gets called when the
browser window is created. Would it make sense to call it before each load?
e.g. after `will-navigate`?
Another way to ask the question would be: how else could I only expose IPC
communications from the renderer to the server (but nothing else) in a way
that is available across `loadUrl` calls?
