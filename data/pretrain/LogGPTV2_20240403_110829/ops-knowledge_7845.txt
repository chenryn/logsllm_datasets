User: How to set up automatic restart of Docker container?
Assistant: You can use the `--restart` parameter to set the automatic restart option of the container when creating the container. For example: ``` docker run --restart=always my_image ``` The above command will create a container named "my_image" with auto restart option enabled. In this way, when the container stops for some reason, Docker will automatically restart the container. In addition to using the `--restart` parameter, you can also use Docker Compose or Docker Swarm to configure automatic restart options for containers. For details, please refer to the official Docker documentation.
