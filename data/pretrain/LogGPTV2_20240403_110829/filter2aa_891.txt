How many future Renaissances and

if we – all of us, for any purpose – keep 
treating the Internet as a place for crime, 
warfare and espionage?  
SECURITY FROM WHAT 
 The DT and complexity 
Why  “Saving” 
Global Shocks 
Initiated or Amplified Through the Internet 
“As  society  becomes  more  
technologic, even the mundane 
comes to depend on distant 
digital  perfection.”       
Dan Geer  
“This  increasingly  tight  coupling  of  the  
internet with the real economy and society 
means a full-scale cyber shock is far more 
likely  to  occur.”   
“Beyond  Data  Breaches:  Global  
Interconnections  of  Cyber  Risk” 
Bad Guys Finish First 
“Few 
if 
any 
contemporary 
computer 
security controls have prevented a [red 
team] 
from 
easily 
accessing 
any 
information sought.”
