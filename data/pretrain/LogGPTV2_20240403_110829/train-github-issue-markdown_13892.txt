Hello,
I use dbscan with a custom distance metric(average between levenshtein and
manhatan).
Two questions:
  * Is there an implementation for an incremental version of dbscan for frequent updates ? or lets say incremental updates ?
  * Since I'm using a custom distance metric, then I use the trick of precomputed distance, so:  
if an incremental version of dbscan exist, how to deal with the precomputed
distance for the updates ? should I increment each time this precomputed
distance for the frequent updates or ... ?
Thanks in advance for your help/discussion
