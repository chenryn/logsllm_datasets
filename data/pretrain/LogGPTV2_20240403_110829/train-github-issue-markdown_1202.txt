 **Symfony version(s) affected** : 3.4.12
**Description**  
The values LessThan::TOO_HIGH_ERROR and LessThntOrEqual::TOO_HIGH_ERROR match
(whereas GreaterThan::TOO_LOW_ERROR and GreaterThanOrEqual::TOO_LOW_ERROR
don't).
I'm not sure which case is supposed to be correct (I suspect the former).
**How to reproduce**  
No reproduction other than to compare the values in the code. ;-)
**Possible Solution**  
Generate a new uuid for one of the Constraints? But what if people have made
assumptions about the value being fixed?
**Additional context**  
None
