ksetup delkdc
Deletes instances of Key Distribution Center (KDC) names for the Kerberos realm.
The mapping is stored in the registry, under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\Kerberos\Domains. After running this command, we recommend making sure the KDC was removed and no longer appears in the list.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\Kerberos\Domains
Note
To remove realm configuration data from multiple computers, use the Security Configuration Template snap-in with policy distribution, instead of using the ksetup command explicitly on individual computers.
Syntax
ksetup /delkdc
