Trying to upload an image from React Native to a server with Axios. I've
attached a screenshot of both the code that I'm using and the Postman form-
data view so you can see what the server expects to receive (uploading via
postman works perfectly so server is all good). Every time I try to upload an
image I get either a status code 400 (promise rejection) error or a network
error.
Here is what the image prop contains - it is directly coming from react-
native-image-crop-picker :  
{"cropRect": {"height": 399, "width": 221, "x": 39, "y": 0}, "height": 1949,
"mime": "image/jpeg", "modificationDate": "1588072959000", "path":
"file:///storage/emulated/0/Pictures/bf28f71b-86e9-485d-ae27-d2edcd07d78d.jpg",
"size": 495417, "width": 1080}
Any help would be amazing! I've been stuck on this for days now and I haven't
found an existing support thread with this issue, apologies though if I have
managed to duplicate a query.
