It appears that you are encountering a `TypeError` when trying to load the GPT-2 tokenizer using the `transformers` library. The error message indicates that the function `re.search` is being called with an argument that is not a string or bytes-like object. Here is a more detailed and professional version of your issue:

**Error Description:**

While attempting to load the GPT-2 tokenizer, I encountered the following `TypeError`:

```python
File "C:\[path]\api\utilities\tokenizers.py", line 4, in <module>
    gpt2 = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("gpt2")
File "C:\[path]\venv\lib\site-packages\transformers\tokenization_utils_base.py", line 1750, in from_pretrained
    commit_hash = extract_commit_hash(resolved_vocab_files[file_id], commit_hash)
File "C:\[path]\venv\lib\site-packages\transformers\utils\hub.py", line 225, in extract_commit_hash
    search = re.search(r"snapshots/([^/]+)/", resolved_file)
File "C:\Program Files\Python310\lib\re.py", line 200, in search
    return _compile(pattern, flags).search(string)
TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object
```

This error started occurring today, and I am looking for a workaround or a stable version of the `transformers` library to which I can roll back.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Import the `GPT2TokenizerFast` from the `transformers` library.
2. Attempt to load the tokenizer using `from_pretrained("gpt2")`.

**Environment:**

- Python version: 3.10
- `transformers` library version: [Please specify the version]
- Operating System: Windows

**Possible Workarounds:**

1. **Check the Input Type:**
   Ensure that the `resolved_file` variable passed to `re.search` is a string or bytes-like object. You can add a type check before calling `re.search`:

   ```python
   if not isinstance(resolved_file, (str, bytes)):
       raise TypeError(f"Expected string or bytes-like object, got {type(resolved_file)}")
   ```

2. **Rollback to a Stable Version:**
   If the issue is due to a recent update, consider rolling back to a previous stable version of the `transformers` library. For example, you can try version 4.11.3:

   ```sh
   pip install transformers==4.11.3
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies:**
   Ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with each other. Sometimes, updating related libraries like `regex` or `requests` can resolve such issues.

4. **Check for Known Issues:**
   Look for any known issues or updates on the `transformers` GitHub repository. There might be a fix or a patch available.

If none of these workarounds resolve the issue, please provide additional details about your environment and the exact version of the `transformers` library you are using. This will help in diagnosing the problem more effectively.
