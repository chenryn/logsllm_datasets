ChatGPT: Optimizing
Language Models
for Dialogue
We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a
conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for
ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes,
challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests.
ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to
follow an instruction in a prompt and provide a
detailed response.

On the Sizes of OpenAI API Models
Using eval harness, we can deduce the sizes of OpenAI API models from their performance.
May 24, 2021 · Leo Gao
OpenAI hasn’t officially said anything about their API model sizes, which naturally leads to the
question of just how big they are. Thankfully, we can use eval harness to evaluate the API models
on a bunch of tasks and compare to the figures in the GPT-3 paper. Obviously since there are
going to be minor differences in task implementation and OpenAI is probably fine tuning their API
models all the time, the numbers don’t line up exactly, but they should give a pretty good idea of
the ballpark things are in.

All GPT-3 figures are from the GPT-3 paper; all API figures are computed using eval harness
Ada, Babbage, Curie and Davinci line up closely with 350M, 1.3B, 6.7B, and 175B respectively.
Obviously this isn’t ironclad evidence that the models are those sizes, but it’s pretty suggestive.

ChatGPT官方博客：迭代部署
Ideally, the model would ask clarifying questions when the user provided an ambiguous query. Instead, our current models usually
guess what the user intended.
While we’ve made eﬀorts to make the model refuse inappropriate requests, it will sometimes respond to harmful instructions or
exhibit biased behavior. We’re using the Moderation API to warn or block certain types of unsafe content, but we expect it to have
some false negatives and positives for now. We’re eager to collect user feedback to aid our ongoing work to improve this system.
Iterative deployment
Today’s research release of ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI’s iterative deployment of increasingly safe and useful AI systems.
Many lessons from deployment of earlier models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed the safety mitigations in place for this release,
including substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF).

This question is a bit tricky because
Christopher Columbus died in , so he
could not have come to the US in . But let’s
pretend for a moment that he did!
If Columbus arrived in the US in , he would
likely be very surprised at the changes that
Tell me about when Christopher Columbus
came to the US in 
Christopher Columbus came to the US in 
and he was very excited to be here. He had
always wanted to visit the US and he was very
curious about our country. He was very
impressed with our country and he enjoyed his
time here.
从部署GPT-3和Codex等早期模型中吸取的许多经验教训，为本版本的安全缓解措
施提供了帮助，包括通过使用人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）来大幅减少有害和失真
信息的输出。

We know that many limitations remain as discussed above and we plan to make regular model updates to improve in such areas. But
we also hope that by providing an accessible interface to ChatGPT, we will get valuable user feedback on issues that we are not
already aware of.
Users are encouraged to provide feedback on problematic model outputs through the UI, as well as on false positives/negatives from
the external content ﬁlter which is also part of the interface. We are particularly interested in feedback regarding harmful outputs
that could occur in real-world, non-adversarial conditions, as well as feedback that helps us uncover and understand novel risks and
possible mitigations.You can choose to enter the ChatGPT Feedback Contest  for a chance to win up to $500 in API credits.
 Entries
can be submitted via the feedback form that is linked in the ChatGPT interface.
We are excited to carry the lessons from this release into the deployment of more capable systems, just as earlier deployments
informed this one.
Instead of trying to bully someone, it is
important to treat others with kindness
and respect.

▶ 我们知道，如上所述，许多局限性仍然存在，我们计划定期更新模型，以改进这些领
域。但我们也希望，通过为ChatGPT提供一个可访问的界面，我们将获得宝贵用户反
馈，以了解更多我们还没有意识到的问题。
▶ 鼓励用户通过用户界面提供关于有问题的模型输出的反馈，以及来自“外部内容过滤
器”的误报/错报，该过滤器也是界面的一部分。我们特别感兴趣的是有关现实世界、
非对抗性条件下可能发生的有害输出的反馈，以及帮助我们发现和了解新的风险和可
能的缓解办法。您可以选择参加ChatGPT反馈竞赛，有机会赢得高达500美元的API积
分。可以通过ChatGPT界面中链接的反馈表提交。
▶ 我们很高兴能将从此版本中获得的经验教训带到更强大的系统的部署中，就像我们以
前做的一样。
