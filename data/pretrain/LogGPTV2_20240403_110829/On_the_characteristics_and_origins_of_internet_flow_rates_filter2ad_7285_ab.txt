log-normal distribution [2]. To test that hypothesis, we use
the quantile-quantile plot (Q-Q plot) [3] to compare the ﬂow
rate distribution with analytical models. The Q-Q plot de-
termines whether a data set has a particular theoretical dis-
tribution by plotting the quantiles of the data set against
the quantiles of the theoretical distribution.
If the data
comes from a population with the given theoretical distri-
bution, then the resulting scatter plot will be approximately
a straight line. The Q-Q plots in Figures 4 and 5 compare
the log of the rate distribution to the normal distribution for
two of the traces (Access1c and Regional2). The ﬁt between
the two is visually good. As in Reference [2], we further
assess the goodness-of-ﬁt using the Shapiro-Wilk normality
test [5]. For Access1c (Figure 4), we can not reject the null
hypothesis that the log of rate comes from normal distribu-
tion at 25% signiﬁcance level; for Regional2 (Figure 5), we
can not reject normality at any level of signiﬁcance. This
suggests the ﬁt for a normal distribution is indeed very good.
Applying the Shapiro-Wilk test on all the packet traces and
ﬂow summary data, we ﬁnd that for 60% of the data sets we
can not reject normality at 5% signiﬁcance level. These re-
sults give evidence that the ﬂow rates can often be described
with a log-normal distribution.
The next question we address is how important the fast
ﬂows are. In particular, how much of the total bytes trans-
ferred are accounted for by the fastest ﬂows? Note that a
skewed rate distribution need not imply that fast ﬂows ac-
count for a large fraction of the bytes. This will depend on
the size of fast ﬂows. Figure 6 plots the fraction of bytes
accounted for in a given percentage of the fastest ﬂows for
the 8 packet traces. We see that in general, the 10% fastest
ﬂows account for between 30% and 90% of all bytes trans-
ferred, and the 20% fast ﬂows account for between 55% and
95%. This indicates that while most ﬂows are not fast, these
fast ﬂows do account for a signiﬁcant fraction of all traﬃc.

Fraction of Datasets
Figure 6: Fraction of bytes in fastest ﬂows
Figure 7: Distribution of the fraction of bytes in
the 10% and 20% fastest ﬂows for summary ﬂow
data.
ﬁgure plots the distribution of the percentage of bytes ac-
counted for by the 10% and 20% fastest ﬂows across the
76 sets of data. The skewed distributions exhibited in the
traces are evident here as well. For example, in over 80% of
the datasets, the fastest 10% of the ﬂows account for at least
50% of the bytes transferred. Similarly, the fastest 20% of
the ﬂows account for over 65% of the bytes in 80% of the
datasets. For comparison, the fraction of bytes in the largest
ﬂows (not shown) is even greater.
We now characterize ﬂows along two dimensions: big or
small, and fast or slow. We chose 100 KByte as a cutoﬀ on
the size dimension and 10 KByte/sec on the rate dimension.
These thresholds are arbitrary, but they provide a way to
characterize ﬂows in a two-by-two taxonomy.
Table 2 shows the fraction of ﬂows and bytes in each of the
4 categories for the packet traces. Flows that are small and
slow, the largest group in each trace, account for between
44% and 63% of ﬂows. However, they account for a relatively
small fraction of the total bytes (10% or less.) There are
also a signiﬁcant number of ﬂows in the small-fast category
(between 30% and 40%) but these too represent a modest
fraction of the total bytes (less than 10% in all but one
trace.) On the other hand, there are a small number of
ﬂows that are both big and fast (generally less than 10%).
These ﬂows account for the bulk of the bytes transferred—at
least 60% in all of the traces, and over 80% in many of them.
The big-slow category is sparsely populated and these ﬂows
account for less than 10% of the bytes. Data for the 76 sets
of summary ﬂow statistics (not shown here) are generally
consistent with the packet trace results.
One question about Internet dynamics is the degree to
which traﬃc is dominated (in diﬀerent ways) by small ﬂows.
In terms of the number of ﬂows, there is little doubt that the
vast majority are indeed small. More than 84% of the ﬂows
in all of our traces (and over 90% in some of them) meet our
(arbitrary) deﬁnition of small. However, before we conclude
that the Internet is dominated by these small ﬂows and that
future designs should be geared towards dealing with them,
we should remember that a very large share of the bytes
are in big and fast ﬂows. In 6 of the 8 traces we examined,
these ﬂows comprised over 80% of the bytes. Thus, when
designing mechanism to control congestion or otherwise deal
with traﬃc arriving at a router, these big and fast ﬂows are
an important (and sometimes dominant) factor.
3.2 Correlations
We next examine the relationship between the ﬂow char-
acteristics of interest. Table 3 shows 3 pairs of correlations—
duration and rate, size and rate, and duration and size—for
the 8 packet traces. We computed correlations of the log of
these data because of the large range and uneven distribu-
tion. We restricted the correlations to ﬂows with durations
longer than 5 seconds. Results for the other ﬂow deﬁnitions
are similar.
The correlations are fairly consistent across traces, and
show a negative correlation between duration and rate, a

Table 3: Correlations of size, rate and duration in 8
packet traces
slight positive correlation between size and duration and a
strong correlation between the size and rate. The correlation
between rate and size is also evident in other subsets of ﬂows.
For ﬂows longer than 1 second, the correlations range from
.65 to .77. For ﬂows lasting longer than 30 seconds, the
correlations range from .90 to .95.
Figure 8 shows CDFs of the 3 correlations taken across
each of our datasets (packet traces and summary ﬂow level
statistics). This ﬁgure shows that the general trend exhib-
ited in the packet traces was also evident in the summary
ﬂow data we examined.
The most striking result here is the correlation between
size and rate.
If users ﬁrst decided how much data they
wanted to transfer (e.g., the size of a ﬁle) independent of
the network conditions, and then sent it over the network,
there would be little correlation between size and rate,1 a
strong correlation between size and duration, and a strongly
negative correlation between rate and duration. This is not
what we see; the negative correlation between rate and du-
ration is fairly weak, the correlation between size and dura-
tion is very weak, and the correlation between size and rate
is very strong. Thus, users appear to choose the size of their
transfer based, strongly, on the available bandwidth. While
some adjustment of user behavior was to be expected, we
were surprised at the extent of the correlation between size
and rate.
1TCP slow-start could cause some correlation between rate
and size. In order to assess the impact of slow-start on the
correlations we observed, we eliminated the ﬁrst 1 second of
all ﬂows and recomputed the correlations. For ﬂows lasting
longer than 5 seconds, the resulting correlations between size
and rate in the 8 traces ranged from .87 to .92, eliminating
slow-start as a signiﬁcant cause of the correlation.
