## Environment:
  * macOS 11.0.1 Big Sur, on an Apple Silicon (M1) chip
  * Safari 14.0.1
  * React 17.0.1
  * React DevTools 4.10.1, running in standalone mode via Electron 11.1.0 (darwin-arm64 build)
  * New project using create-react-app . with the useScript hook to add the  tag required by React DevTools.
## Steps to reproduce
  1. Install `react-devtools` using `npm install --save-dev react-devtools`.
  2. A  for the React DevTools is added in App.js. Start the DevTools in standalone mode
    ./node_modules/react-devtools/bin.js
  3. Start the React app's development server:
    yarn start
Refresh the React app if needed to establish a connection with the DevTools.
The _Components_ view is blank (no matter what filters are applied):

blank/blob/master/blank-components-react-devtools.gif?raw=true)

## The current behavior
Components view is blank; the React DevTools component seems to register the
app but nothing further.
## The expected behavior
Full component tree and a working integration between Safari and standalone
DevTools.
