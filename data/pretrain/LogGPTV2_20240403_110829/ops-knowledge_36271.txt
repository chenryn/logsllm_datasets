User:  Please describe the multiple layers of defense in cybersecurity and the role of each layer.
Assistant: The multi-level defense system of network security refers to the establishment of multiple security defense lines in the network, and the measures for the security protection of the network system respectively. It mainly consists of the following layers: 1. Network control layer: This layer is mainly responsible for the control and management of network traffic, and monitors and filters the network through firewalls, intrusion detection systems and other equipment, thereby preventing unauthorized access and malicious attack. 2. Identity authentication and access control layer: This layer is mainly responsible for authorizing and authenticating user identities to ensure network access security. By setting security policies, passwords, and other authentication tools to limit user access rights, strict access control is carried out on the network. 3. Data security layer: This layer mainly takes care of data protection and backup, and ensures that sensitive data is not stolen or tampered with through encryption, access control and other measures. 4. Application security layer: This layer is mainly responsible for protecting the security of application software and preventing application systems from being attacked or exploited. Common application security measures include code auditing, vulnerability scanning, server hardening, and other methods. By establishing a multi-layer defense system, the security of the network environment can be protected to the greatest extent, and the network security capability and resistance can be improved.
