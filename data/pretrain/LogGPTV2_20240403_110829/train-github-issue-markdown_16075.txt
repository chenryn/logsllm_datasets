The declaration of the `process` method in `Symfony\Bundle\AsseticBundle\Factory\Worker\UseControllerWorker` must be compatible with the `process` method defined in the `Assetic\Factory\Worker\WorkerInterface`. Specifically, it should match the following signature:

```php
public function process(Assetic\Asset\AssetInterface $asset, Assetic\Factory\AssetFactory $factory);
```

This ensures that the `UseControllerWorker` class correctly implements the `WorkerInterface` and adheres to its contract.
