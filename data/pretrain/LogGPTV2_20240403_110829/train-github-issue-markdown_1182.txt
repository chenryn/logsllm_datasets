  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
I wanted to move styled-jsx code to a dedicated variable and then inject it
into the `render()` method like this:
    const divstyle = (
    );
    return (
        foo
        {divstyle}
    );
This will inject the style into the DOM but not scoped. In console I see this
error:
    Warning: Received `true` for a non-boolean attribute `jsx`.
    If you want to write it to the DOM, pass a string instead: jsx="true" or jsx={value.toString()}.
If I move the `` part from the variable back into the render
method, everything works perfectly.
What's wrong? Isn't it possible to to use styled-jsx outside of `render()` ?
