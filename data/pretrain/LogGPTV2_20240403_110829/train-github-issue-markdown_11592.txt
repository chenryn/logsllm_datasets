# Environment
    Windows build number: [10.0.18363.900]
    PowerToys version: 0.19.0
    PowerToy module: PowerToys Run
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Use Alt + Tab to switch window.
  2. Do something or not. Seems not to change something, as long it is not alt.
  3. Press Space
# Expected behavior
After using Alt+Tab PowerToys should not pop up. Because Alt+Space is the
Shortcut.
# Actual behavior
PowerToys Run pop up. When click back to the window the next space opens
PowerToys Run again. Until you press alt again.
