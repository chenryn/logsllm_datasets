1In a generic group model, the adversary is only given access
to a randomly chosen encoding of a group, instead of eﬃ-
cient encodings. Up to now, the GFP is still hard for most
non-abelian groups such as Suzuki 2-Groups and GLn(R),
etc. The most eﬃcient algorithm of solving GFP is sub-
exponential for group SL2(F2m ) [16].
896We say that Ω is an index exchangeable family (IEF) on any
g ∈ G, denoted by ΩieK (g), if
ϕKi (ϕKj (g)) = ϕKj (ϕKi (g))
holds for ∀Ki, Kj ∈ K. Furthermore,if Ω is an IEF on every
g ∈ G, we call Ω an IEF over G, denoted by ΩieK (G).
As for cryptographic applications, we propose the follow-
ing basic security requirements for the above deﬁned IEF
ΩieK (g): 2
• Onewayness of map index (OMI): Given a pair (g,
ϕKi (g)) ∈ G2, it is hard to derive Ki ∈ K. (Note that
this implies that K should be large enough; otherwise,
one can easily get Ki with non-negligible probability
by guessing.)
• Onewayness of map composition (OMC): Given a triple
(g, ϕKi (g), ϕKj (g)) ∈ G3, it is hard to compute g0 ∈ G
such that g0 = ϕKi (ϕKj (g)), where Ki, Kj ∈ K.
• Conﬁdentiality of map composition (CMC): Given a
quadruple (g, g0, ϕKi (g), ϕKj (g)) ∈ G4, it is hard to
decide whether or not g0 = ϕKi (ϕKj (g)), where Ki, Kj
∈ K.
Apparently, a Diﬃe-Hellman like key exchange protocol
can be immediately obtained by using an ΩieK (g) with CMC
property, in which Ki, Kj ∈ K are viewed as temporary
keys of two parties and then ϕKj (ϕKi (g)) is their shared
session key. One can also do this by using an ΩieK (g) with
merely OMI property, plus a universal hash function that is
used as the key deriving function. Similarly, an Elgamal like
encryption scheme can also be derived based on an ΩieK (g)
with CMC property.
3.2 Cramer-Shoup Encryption Scheme From
Index Exchangeable Families
Now, let us propose a Cramer-Shoup like encryption scheme
based on index exchangeable families.
Key Generation: Let λ be the system security parameter.
Suppose that G is a ﬁnite group with order |G| = 2Θ(λ)
and ΩieK (g) is an associated index exchangeable family
for any g ∈ G and index set K. Let H : G3 → K and
H0 : G → {0, 1}λ be cryptographic hash functions.
Randomly choose K1, K2, K3, K4 ∈ K and compute
g1 = ϕK1 (g0), b = ϕK2 (g0), c = ϕK3 (g1), d = ϕK4 (g1).
Then, the public key is pk = (G,K, g0, g1, b, c, d, H, H0)
and the secret key is sk = (K2, K3, K4).
Encryption: To encrypt a message m ∈ {0, 1}λ, one chooses
K5 ∈ K at random and then outputs a ciphertext as:
C = (u, v, e, w) = (ϕK5 (g0), ϕK5 (g1),
H0(ϕK5 (b)ϕK5 (c)) ⊕ m, ϕK5 (d)ϕα(ϕK5 (b))),
where α = H(u, v, e) ∈ K.
2We will see that for cryptographic applications, we merely
need a ΩieK (g) for some g ∈ G, instead of ΩieK (G).
Decryption: Upon receiving a ciphertext C = (u, v, e, w),
the receiver knowing the secret key sk at ﬁrst checks
whether the equation
w = ϕK4 (v) · ϕα(ϕK2 (u))
(1)
holds, where α = H(u, v, e). If so, he/she computes
the message
m = H0(ϕK2 (u) · ϕK3 (v)) ⊕ e;
(2)
otherwise, he/she outputs ⊥, for indicating that C is
an invalid ciphertext.
Consistency. To prove the correctness of the above scheme,
one only needs to notice the following equalities:
w = ϕK5 (d) · ϕα(ϕK5 (b))
= ϕK5 (ϕK4 (g1)) · ϕα(ϕK5 (ϕK2 (g0)))
= ϕK4 (ϕK5 (g1)) · ϕα(ϕK2 (ϕK5 (g0)))
= ϕK4 (v) · ϕα(ϕK2 (u)),
e = H0(ϕK5 (b)ϕK5 (c)) ⊕ m
= H0(ϕK5 (ϕK2 (g0))ϕK5 (ϕK3 (g1))) ⊕ m
= H0(ϕK2 (ϕK5 (g0))ϕK3 (ϕK5 (g1))) ⊕ m
= H0(ϕK2 (u)ϕK3 (v)) ⊕ m.
Remark 1. The above framework is diﬀerent from the o-
riginal construction in [4], especially for key generation. Ac-
tually, based on the algorithm of decryption of the Cramer-
Shoup scheme, the multiplication homomorphism of expo-
nential function is used in veriﬁcation equation. However, in
non-abelian algebraic structure, the functions of IEF some-
times cannot provide this homomorphism as ϕKi (g1g2) (cid:54)=
ϕKi (g1)ϕKi (g2). Besides, H0 is employed for enhancing the
security. Particularly, the OMI assumption is required in
the security proof.
3.3 Security
The following theorems capture the security of the pro-
posed scheme.
Theorem 1. The encryption scheme is semantic secure a-
gainst adaptively chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA) in
the standard model, assuming that the associated index ex-
changeable family ΩieK (g0) satisﬁes the property of CMC.
Proof. (Sketch of the proof.) Suppose there is an adver-
sary A that can break the IND-CCA security of the above
scheme with non-negligible probability. Now, let us con-
struct a simulator S that can break the CMC property of
the associated IEF ΩieK (g0) with non-negligible probability,
too.
Suppose that S is given the CMC challenge, i.e. a quadru-
ple
(g0, g1 = ϕK1 (g0), g2 = ϕK5 (g0), g3) ∈ G4,
and its purpose is to decide whether g3 = ϕK1 (ϕK5 (g0)) or
not. The simulator will invokes A in executing the following
IND-CCA game:
Setup: The simulator randomly chooses K2, K3, K4 ∈ K,
and computes
b = ϕK2 (g0), c = ϕK3 (g1), d = ϕK4 (g1).
Then, the simulator S sends the public key pk =
(G,K, g0, g1, b, c, d, H, H0) to the adversary A, while
897keeps the secret key sk = (K2, K3, K4) only known to
himself/herself.
Phase 1: Now, the adversary A can invoke decryption queries
at his/her will, and the simulator produces the re-
sponse accordingly by using the secret key sk.
Challenge: The adversary A submits two equal-length chal-
lenge messages m0, m1 ∈ G to the simulator S. Then,
S ﬂips a fair coin β ∈ {0, 1}, and then replies A with
the challenge ciphertext that is computed as below:
∗
∗
= (u
, v
∗
, e
∗
C
, w
∗
) = (g2, g3,
H0(ϕK2 (g2)ϕK3 (g3)) ⊕ mβ, ϕK4 (g3) · ϕα∗ (ϕK2 (g2))),
where α∗ = H(u∗, v∗, e∗).
Phase 2: Now, the adversary A will continue to invoke de-
cryption queries at his/her will, except that the de-
cryption query on the challenge ciphertext C∗ is not
allowed. In response, the simulator, by using the se-
cret key sk, will check the validity of the ciphertexts
and then output the corresponding messages or ⊥.
Guess: Finally, the adversary A outputs β(cid:48) ∈ {0, 1} as a
guess on β. Now, if β(cid:48) = β, the simulator S answer-
s his/her CMC challenge with 1 for indicating g3 =
ϕK1 (ϕK5 (g0)); otherwise, S simply answers his/her
CMC challenge at random.
Now, let us consider S’s advantage for making correct deci-
sion on his/her CMC challenge. Apparently, if g3 is random,
then C∗ is also random and gives no information about the
simulator’s choice of β. Thus in this case, both A and S
have no any advantage in making correct decisions. On the
other hand, if g3 = ϕK1 (ϕK5 (g0)), then the challenge ci-
phertext C∗ is well formed under the public key pk. Thus
in this case, whenever the adversary A has non-negligible
advantage in making correct guess on β, the simulator S
has non-negligible advantage in making correct decision on
his/her CMC challenge. This concludes the theorem.
In the following theorem, we illustrate that the bit β is
independent from the adversary’s view.
Theorem 2. Any information of the challenged message
won’t be revealed in Phase 2.
Proof. Suppose the adversary invokes decryption query
on the ciphertext C = (u, v, e, w) (cid:54)= (u∗, v∗, e∗, w∗) after
Challenge phase. We discuss by the following three cases.
Case 1: (u, v, e) = (u∗, v∗, e∗).
In this case, the hash values are the same, but w (cid:54)= w∗
implies that the decryption query will be rejected.
Case 2: (u, v, e) (cid:54)= (u∗, v∗, e∗) and α = α∗.
If this happens with non-negligible probability, then it
is a contradictory for the collision-resistant property of
the hash function H.
Case 3: (u, v, e) (cid:54)= (u∗, v∗, e∗) and α (cid:54)= α∗.
(1) When u = u∗ and v = v∗, then e (cid:54)= e∗. The
adversary fails to construct w such that w = ϕK4 (v∗)·
ϕα(ϕK2 (u∗)) since ϕK4 (v∗) and ϕK2 (u∗) are unknown.
That is, such a query will be rejected.
(2) When u (cid:54)= u∗ or v (cid:54)= v∗, baesd on the collision-
resistance of H0, H0(ϕK2 (u)ϕK3 (v)) is random and
independent from H0(ϕK2 (u∗)ϕK3 (v∗)). In this case,
even if C can pass the veriﬁcation equation (1), the
replied message is unrelated to the challenged message.
This concludes the theorem.
Note that in the above reduction on the conﬁdentiality of
ciphertext, the simulator S is allowed to possess the secret
key sk during his/her whole interactive process with the
adversary A. This idea is directly inherited from the original
Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem [4]. Therefore, to establish the
fully conﬁdence on the security of the above scheme, we need
to further show the conﬁdential of the secret key against
chosen ciphertext attacks.
Actually, after a polynomial number of queries of cipher-
texts to the decryption oracle, the adversary can get the fol-
lowing equations about secret key K2, K3 from decryption
ei ⊕ mi = H0(ϕK2 (ui)ϕK3 (vi))
algorithms: e1 ⊕ m1 = H0(ϕK2 (u1)ϕK3 (v1))
 w1 = ϕK4 (v1) · ϕα(ϕK2 (u1))
wi = ϕK4 (vi) · ϕα(ϕK2 (ui))
Meanwhile, A also obtains the equations about secret key
about K2, K3, K4 from veriﬁcation equations:
···
···
Here, ui, vi, ei, wi, mi, α are known to the adversary A. Then,
the security of secret key is based on the GFP and the OMI.

INSTANTIATIONS
In this section, we give some concrete instantiations of the
so-called index exchangeable families. The corresponding
schemes can be obtained based on these IEFs.
4.1 Instantiations of IEFs
• IEF based on DDH problem. Let G = (cid:104)g(cid:105) be a
cyclic group with order of λ. Let us deﬁne the index-
set as
K = {Ki = xi : xi ∈ Zλ}.
Meanwhile, for each Ki ∈ K, the map ϕKi : G → G is
deﬁned as
ϕKi (g) = gxi .
It is easy to see that
ϕKi (ϕKj (g)) = (gxj )xi = ϕKj (ϕKi (g)).
Thus, we indeed get an index exchangeable family ΩieK (g).
It is a very straight observation that ΩieK (g) meets the
property of CMC, under the intractability assumption
of DDH problem over G.
