User: I've got some tests which log to stdout, and I'd like to change the log level in my test script based on the verbosity that nose is running on. 
How can I access the verbosity of the running nose instance, from within one of the tests being run?
Assistant: It looks like the expected way to handle this in nose is to use the logger framework within your tests, and then control the level to be captured with the --logging-level option.
By default nose will capture all logs made by the tests, but a filter can be specified using --logging-filter config parameter.
