I have some tests that log to `stdout`, and I would like to adjust the log level in my test script based on the verbosity setting used by `nose`. 

How can I access the verbosity level of the running `nose` instance from within one of the tests being executed?

**Solution:**

To handle this in `nose`, you should use the logging framework within your tests. You can then control the log level using the `--logging-level` option. By default, `nose` captures all logs generated by the tests. However, you can specify a filter for the logs using the `--logging-filter` configuration parameter.
