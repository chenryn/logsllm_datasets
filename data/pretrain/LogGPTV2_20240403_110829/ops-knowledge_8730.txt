Question: "In a Windows server environment, what would be the consequence of disabling the 'Microsoft network server: Attempt S4U2Self to obtain claim information' security policy setting in terms of user claims and access to files with claim-based access control policy?"
 "A": "Disabling the setting would improve server performance since it would reduce the number of network requests to domain controllers."
 "B": "Disabling the setting would have no effect on access to files with claim-based access control policy, as user claims would still be processed by default mechanisms."
 "C": "Disabling the setting would prevent the server from obtaining a claims-enabled access token for client principals, potentially restricting access to files requiring user claims."
 "D": "Disabling the setting would enhance security by preventing unauthorized users from accessing files, even if the files have claim-based access control policy."
Answer: C
