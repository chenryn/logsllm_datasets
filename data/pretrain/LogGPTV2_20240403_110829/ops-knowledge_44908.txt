User: How to check if a website's SSL certificate has expired?
Assistant: You can check whether the SSL certificate of a website has expired in the following ways: 1. Enter the website address in the browser address bar, and add https:// in front. If a lock icon appears in your browser, it means the website is using an SSL certificate. 2. Click the lock icon and select the "Certificate Information" option. This will open a window with certificate details. 3. In the Certificate Details window, locate the Validity period information. This information will tell you when the certificate became valid and when it expired. 4. If the certificate has expired, you will see a red warning that the site is a security risk and you should leave the site. 5. If you want to further verify the certificate, you can check the "Issuance Authority" and "Certificate Fingerprint" information to ensure that the certificate source is legitimate and has not been tampered with. It should be noted that the validity period of SSL certificates usually ranges from 1 to 3 years, and it needs to be renewed in time after expiration, otherwise it may cause security risks.
