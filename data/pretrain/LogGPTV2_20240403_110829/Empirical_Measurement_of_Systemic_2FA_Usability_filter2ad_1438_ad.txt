by the support staff, a quarter of which were categorized
as “Incidents,” “Fraud,” “Locked Out,” and “Broken or
Replacement Token.” Confusion with the Duo app caused
18% of tickets, and another 18% were attributed to hardware
tokens. It is unclear whether the latter were problems with
hardware tokens, or merely people seeking to obtain the
free hardware token CMU offered. Another 39% were
miscellaneous 2FA problems labeled “Request” and “User
Questions or Consultation” and “Add to All-SP service.”
Similar to our ﬁndings, Abbott and Patil found that the
largest concerns for users were related to setting up 2FA
and ﬁnding conﬁguration information (81% of analyzed
transcripts), including information about registering an
additional device (28%), accessing accounts when the device
used for 2FA is inaccessible (16.58%), obtaining a physical
token (15%), and interacting with the Virtual Private Network
(VPN) for off-campus access (6%). We complement their
ﬁndings by including information about the speciﬁc 2FA
factor that contributed to the problem. Dutson et al.’s survey
found that the most common issue (52%) reported was losing
the phone registered for telephony 2FA or with the Duo app
on it [13]. This agrees with our ﬁnding that telephony support
tickets were the most common device-attributable cause.
4.6 Account Recovery
Many of the miscellaneous 2FA support tickets we analyzed
ended with the support staff issuing a temporary account
recovery token to bypass 2FA. When users encounter a 2FA
problem they cannot resolve easily, they can opt to use this
account recovery workﬂow. UIUC allows up to 24 bypass
tokens to be generated by technical support staff or sent to a
personal recovery email address. UCB users can only receive
a bypass from technical support staff. Using this bypass
indicates an issue that prevented a user from using the regular
2FA workﬂow, e.g., forgetting a phone at home. How often do
users resort to this bypass? How common is it among users
to have been driven to this workﬂow at some point?
We examined 2FA bypass tokens at each university per
unique user ID. Once obtained, a token is valid for multiple
authentications over three days. Only about 5% of users
resorted to this bypass, with only about 2% using one twice or
more. The group of users at UIUC with the highest per-person
recovery rate was the College of Media with an average of
2.7 bypasses per person. The maximum 2FA bypasses by a
single user during the time period was 198.
Our analysis revealed that a small number of users tried to
use this bypass as their primary authentication method until
they ran into yearly maximum limits:
“Client called because they had run out of
bypasses/had requested the maximum amount of
temporary passcodes.” (HELPDESK-6119)
“Client called in, does not have her phone with
her right now, and has run out of bypass codes.”
(HELPDESK-5536)
5 Variance in Usability
Our second research question asks what factors beyond the
previously discussed system design choices plausibly explain
observed variances in usability. Because our methodology was
observational rather than experimental, we cannot establish a
causality. However, looking at users choices of second factors
as well as user demographics suggest plausible explanations
for some of this variance. Some demographics of users use
the 2FA system in distinct ways, and some second factors are
more problematic than others. We expect that the variance
observed in each of these dimensions may combine to explain
why the error rates at UIUC and UCB differ.
2FA Preferences and Second Factors
5.1
We begin by describing the choice of second factor devices by
users at each university. At UIUC, the relative usage of each
factor changed over time (Figure 6). Early adopters of 2FA
used TOTP/HOTP/Recovery codes about as often as push
notiﬁcations for 2FA. At the time when all faculty, staff, and
graduate students were forced to use 2FA, push notiﬁcations
and SMS messages became the most common 2FA choices.
At UCB, the distribution of 2nd factor choices was stable.
Push notiﬁcations are by far the most common 2FA choice at
UCB and represent a consistent 60% of logins. Phone calls
and app codes are tied for about 15% of logins.
We observed that users did not tend to switch between the
second factors that they used. The median user at UIUC tried
only two second factor options. The median user at UCB tried

three. Duo App push notiﬁcations were tried at least once by
75% of UCB users , but only by 47% of UIUC users. SMS
was tried by 60% of UIUC users, but only by 30% at UCB.
Half of UCB’s users tried the ofﬂine 2FA code generation
feature of the Duo App, but only 10% tried it at UIUC. Three
percent of support tickets at UIUC were resolved by trying
a new form of 2FA. UCB managed to get at least 50% of
their users to try a system that would not fail when traveling
or without cell service.
This variety of user 2FA choices stands in contrast with
Colnago et al.’s ﬁndings because CMU does not allow
telephony-based authentications. They reported users using
89% push notiﬁcations, 5% app codes, and 5% various tokens
with users using an average of 1.3 types of 2FA.
We also investigated this error rate in the context of the
second factor choices users made at each university. We report
the error rates broken down by second factor choice in Table 4.
Telephony (phone and SMS) factors had the greatest error
rate. U2F token users had the lowest error rate. Unfortunately,
failures in entering codes were not always attributed in the
logs to a particular second factor.
5.2 Demographics
Another plausible explanation for variance in 2FA usability is
users’ expertise or the sensitivity of their tasks. To understand
what roles within an organization behave differently than
others, we analyzed several of our previous indicators in
conjunction with generalizable categories of organization
members. The results are reported in Table 5.
Because a technical background might have an effect on
2FA effectiveness, we ﬁrst compared members of academic
departments of science, mathematics, engineering, medicine,
etc.

history, etc. We found little difference among the two

to technical experience. The largest difference was a 10%
higher preference for the Duo app over phone and SMS
authentications among the more technical departments.
IT staff and civil service staff showed the lowest failure
rates when using 2FA, but the effect size is small with less
than a 3% overall difference in failure rates among the mean
and median members of these groups.
The median number of authentications during our
measurement was around 120 for groups except Faculty, IT,
and Facilities workers. The median IT worker authenticated
about 50% more often than others. The median faculty
member authenticated about 25% less often than the overall
mean. Facilities and public safety workers authenticated less
than half as often as other employees and students.
It appears that hardware tokens are used more often among
populations where personal funds are not required to purchase
the device. Facilities employees, faculty, and staff working
with sensitive data are the most likely to authenticate with a
hardware token or Yubikey. Faculty had access to hardware
tokens paid for by their departments. Students and overall staff
are the least likely to use hardware tokens. For the students,
purchasing tokens at UIUC is an extra expense ($10-$40
depending on token type).

5.3 Learning Curve for New Users
We might expect errors to be much higher for users recently
joining the system. Figure 7 shows the error rate of users for
whom we had 2FA registration information on for each of
their ﬁrst 90 days using the system. There were prominent
learning effects at UCB only on the ﬁrst day, where there was
an elevated percentage of incorrectly typed codes. However,
at UIUC, There is a clear trend throughout the ﬁrst month
where abandonment rates slowly fall, to be replaced by errors.
6 Discussion
We discuss the ﬁndings an organization should consider
when planning to implement or improve their 2FA system
based on what we learn from these case studies. Our results
indicate the day-to-day cost of 2FA to be similar to other
compliance and risk-management programs common to large
organizations. We caution that 2FA can exacerbate user
frustrations with fragmented authentication systems, low or no
device remembrance, and short session timeouts. Fragmented
authentication systems can also lead to integration challenges
as 2FA is turned on across various populations and services.
We conclude with an acknowledgement of the limitations of
our work and identify open questions for future inquiry.
6.1 Low Compliance Cost of 2FA
The total compliance cost of 2FA in terms of organization
time is similar to that of other common risk-mitigation
and compliance initiatives, such as trainings in ethics, legal
compliance, ﬁrst aid, etc. In this way, 2FA is not an unusual
burden in terms of total time taken per user. However,
2FA differs from these other compliance initiatives in that
it becomes an extra task along the critical path to many
primary tasks. It therefore appears that user annoyance
with 2FA evident in prior work is unlikely to be due to
the overall time 2FA takes. However, users may still be
experiencing the impression of a long time spent due to
their 2FA frequency or due to the recovery cost of errors.
As Hauer et al. recently explored [15], users’ percieved level
of availability differs from actual availability. Furthermore, as
more services support or require 2FA, the combined burden
across all their services may scale beyond users’ patience.
6.2 Multiplicative Effects on the User Burden
Despite making very different choices about session
management, UIUC and UCB users end up spending a
similar amount of time on 2FA. UIUC allowed no device
remembrance during our data collection period, while UCB
had a 30-day window available. However, UCB has much
