### Table 4: Comparison of Error Rates with Each Second Factor
This table compares the frequency of errors for each second factor type at UIUC and UCB. The "Total" line excludes remembered devices and errors occurring before a second factor was selected.

| Second Factor | UIUC Error Rate | UCB Error Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Phone         | 75.00%          | 15.56%          |
| SMS           | 7.85%           | 8.94%           |
| Duo App       | 0.00%           | 0.00%           |
| Hardware Token| 100.00%         | 100.00%         |

### Support Ticket Analysis
Of the support tickets, a quarter were categorized as “Incidents,” “Fraud,” “Locked Out,” and “Broken or Replacement Token.” Confusion with the Duo app caused 18% of tickets, and another 18% were attributed to hardware tokens. It is unclear whether the latter were problems with hardware tokens or merely people seeking to obtain the free hardware token offered by CMU. Another 39% were miscellaneous 2FA problems labeled “Request,” “User Questions or Consultation,” and “Add to All-SP service.”

Similar to our findings, Abbott and Patil found that the largest concerns for users were related to setting up 2FA and finding configuration information (81% of analyzed transcripts). This includes information about registering an additional device (28%), accessing accounts when the device used for 2FA is inaccessible (16.58%), obtaining a physical token (15%), and interacting with the Virtual Private Network (VPN) for off-campus access (6%). Our study complements their findings by including information about the specific 2FA factor that contributed to the problem. Dutson et al.’s survey found that the most common issue (52%) reported was losing the phone registered for telephony 2FA or with the Duo app on it [13]. This aligns with our finding that telephony support tickets were the most common device-attributable cause.

### 4.6 Account Recovery
Many of the miscellaneous 2FA support tickets we analyzed ended with the support staff issuing a temporary account recovery token to bypass 2FA. When users encounter a 2FA problem they cannot resolve easily, they can opt to use this account recovery workflow. UIUC allows up to 24 bypass tokens to be generated by technical support staff or sent to a personal recovery email address. UCB users can only receive a bypass from technical support staff. Using this bypass indicates an issue that prevented a user from using the regular 2FA workflow, e.g., forgetting a phone at home. How often do users resort to this bypass? How common is it among users to have been driven to this workflow at some point?

We examined 2FA bypass tokens at each university per unique user ID. Once obtained, a token is valid for multiple authentications over three days. Only about 5% of users resorted to this bypass, with only about 2% using one twice or more. The group of users at UIUC with the highest per-person recovery rate was the College of Media, with an average of 2.7 bypasses per person. The maximum 2FA bypasses by a single user during the time period was 198.

Our analysis revealed that a small number of users tried to use this bypass as their primary authentication method until they ran into yearly maximum limits:
- "Client called because they had run out of bypasses/had requested the maximum amount of temporary passcodes." (HELPDESK-6119)
- "Client called in, does not have her phone with her right now, and has run out of bypass codes." (HELPDESK-5536)

### 5 Variance in Usability
Our second research question asks what factors beyond the previously discussed system design choices plausibly explain observed variances in usability. Because our methodology was observational rather than experimental, we cannot establish causality. However, looking at users' choices of second factors and user demographics suggest plausible explanations for some of this variance. Some demographics of users use the 2FA system in distinct ways, and some second factors are more problematic than others. We expect that the variance observed in each of these dimensions may combine to explain why the error rates at UIUC and UCB differ.

#### 5.1 2FA Preferences and Second Factors
We begin by describing the choice of second factor devices by users at each university. At UIUC, the relative usage of each factor changed over time (Figure 6). Early adopters of 2FA used TOTP/HOTP/Recovery codes about as often as push notifications for 2FA. At the time when all faculty, staff, and graduate students were forced to use 2FA, push notifications and SMS messages became the most common 2FA choices. At UCB, the distribution of second factor choices was stable. Push notifications are by far the most common 2FA choice at UCB and represent a consistent 60% of logins. Phone calls and app codes are tied for about 15% of logins.

We observed that users did not tend to switch between the second factors that they used. The median user at UIUC tried only two second factor options. The median user at UCB tried three. Duo App push notifications were tried at least once by 75% of UCB users but only by 47% of UIUC users. SMS was tried by 60% of UIUC users but only by 30% at UCB. Half of UCB’s users tried the offline 2FA code generation feature of the Duo App, but only 10% tried it at UIUC. Three percent of support tickets at UIUC were resolved by trying a new form of 2FA. UCB managed to get at least 50% of their users to try a system that would not fail when traveling or without cell service.

This variety of user 2FA choices stands in contrast with Colnago et al.’s findings because CMU does not allow telephony-based authentications. They reported users using 89% push notifications, 5% app codes, and 5% various tokens, with users using an average of 1.3 types of 2FA.

We also investigated the error rate in the context of the second factor choices users made at each university. We report the error rates broken down by second factor choice in Table 4. Telephony (phone and SMS) factors had the greatest error rate. U2F token users had the lowest error rate. Unfortunately, failures in entering codes were not always attributed in the logs to a particular second factor.

#### 5.2 Demographics
Another plausible explanation for variance in 2FA usability is users’ expertise or the sensitivity of their tasks. To understand what roles within an organization behave differently than others, we analyzed several of our previous indicators in conjunction with generalizable categories of organization members. The results are reported in Table 5.

Because a technical background might have an effect on 2FA effectiveness, we first compared members of academic departments of science, mathematics, engineering, medicine, etc., with those from departments of law, psychology, sociology, history, etc. We found little difference between the two populations, showing no evidence of an effect correlating to technical experience. The largest difference was a 10% higher preference for the Duo app over phone and SMS authentications among the more technical departments.

IT staff and civil service staff showed the lowest failure rates when using 2FA, but the effect size is small, with less than a 3% overall difference in failure rates among the mean and median members of these groups.

The median number of authentications during our measurement was around 120 for most groups, except for Faculty, IT, and Facilities workers. The median IT worker authenticated about 50% more often than others. The median faculty member authenticated about 25% less often than the overall mean. Facilities and public safety workers authenticated less than half as often as other employees and students.

It appears that hardware tokens are used more often among populations where personal funds are not required to purchase the device. Facilities employees, faculty, and staff working with sensitive data are the most likely to authenticate with a hardware token or Yubikey. Faculty had access to hardware tokens paid for by their departments. Students and overall staff are the least likely to use hardware tokens. For students, purchasing tokens at UIUC is an extra expense ($10-$40 depending on token type).

#### Figure 7: Error Rates in First 90 Days Since Adoption
Daily error rate since the first recorded enrollment event per user. UIUC users have an elevated error rate throughout the first 90 days. UCB users’ error rates conform to normal error rates after about a month.

### 5.3 Learning Curve for New Users
We might expect errors to be much higher for users recently joining the system. Figure 7 shows the error rate of users for whom we had 2FA registration information on for each of their first 90 days using the system. There were prominent learning effects at UCB only on the first day, where there was an elevated percentage of incorrectly typed codes. However, at UIUC, there is a clear trend throughout the first month where abandonment rates slowly fall, to be replaced by errors.

### 6 Discussion
We discuss the findings an organization should consider when planning to implement or improve their 2FA system based on what we learn from these case studies. Our results indicate the day-to-day cost of 2FA to be similar to other compliance and risk-management programs common to large organizations. We caution that 2FA can exacerbate user frustrations with fragmented authentication systems, low or no device remembrance, and short session timeouts. Fragmented authentication systems can also lead to integration challenges as 2FA is turned on across various populations and services. We conclude with an acknowledgment of the limitations of our work and identify open questions for future inquiry.

#### 6.1 Low Compliance Cost of 2FA
The total compliance cost of 2FA in terms of organization time is similar to that of other common risk-mitigation and compliance initiatives, such as trainings in ethics, legal compliance, first aid, etc. In this way, 2FA is not an unusual burden in terms of total time taken per user. However, 2FA differs from these other compliance initiatives in that it becomes an extra task along the critical path to many primary tasks. Therefore, user annoyance with 2FA evident in prior work is unlikely to be due to the overall time 2FA takes. However, users may still be experiencing the impression of a long time spent due to their 2FA frequency or due to the recovery cost of errors. As Hauer et al. recently explored [15], users’ perceived level of availability differs from actual availability. Furthermore, as more services support or require 2FA, the combined burden across all their services may scale beyond users’ patience.

#### 6.2 Multiplicative Effects on the User Burden
Despite making very different choices about session management, UIUC and UCB users end up spending a similar amount of time on 2FA. UIUC allowed no device remembrance during our data collection period, while UCB had a 30-day window available. However, UCB has much shorter session timeouts, which may balance the time spent on 2FA.
