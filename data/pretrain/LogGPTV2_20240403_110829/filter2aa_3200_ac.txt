State Interoperable Communications: DHS Funded Activities 
May 2006 
5. Interoperable communications has been established with the deployment of common 
frequencies and the acquisition of the associated and necessary support vehicles. These 
units have been placed in all of the regions (complete). Inter-ops remain an on-going 
process of examination and testing. The Arizona Emergency Radio System (AERS) is the 
primary solution for near-term statewide interoperability as a result of the Statewide 
Interoperability Project Study –2005.  The AERS Project consist of the installation of a 4-
radio suite (VHF, UHF, 800, VHF2) into 45- remote DPS sites throughout Arizona that 
will provide access to a mutual-aid channel for interagency communications. Arizona 
DPS has recently awarded a contract to reassess capabilities to ascertain and examine any 
remaining gaps that may exist in the communication area. This was in response to several 
after action reports generated from exercises conducted at both the regional and state 
level after the deployment of the communication package. ADEM established a 
cooperative public-private partnership with the Arizona Public Service electric company 
to utilize their statewide 800 MHz trunked communication system.  Portable radios were 
installed at all County EOCS and the State Emergency Operations Center.    
Identified Actions: 
• Five communication vans were purchased by the State of Arizona to address the needs 
associated with interoperable communication problems 
• Arizona continues to strengthen and enhance the overall communication interoperability 
system in place.  There exists an integrated and unified approach to work with elements 
of private industry and utilize existing system capabilities already available. 
• Phoenix UASI: Much of their effort involves the purchase of sophisticated 
communication equipment. Much of this has been accomplished with DHS support 
(funding).  While most of the equipment and vehicles are funded through DHS, the costs 
of training, make-ready and personnel are absorbed by the City.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
Arkansas is nearing completion of Phase I of the Arkansas Wireless 
Information Network (AWIN) program.  The results of Phase I will allow 
users at both the state and local levels of government to operate on a state-
wide, interoperable, digital communications network, utilizing the Project 
25 platform in the 700/800 MHz frequency bands.  AWIN will allow state 
and local command and control personnel to communicate on one system. 
A pilot project has commenced that will more fully deploy wireless infrastructure and radios to 
all first-responders in the three 
selected counties to demonstrate 
the full potential of AWIN.  
Total amount budgeted (much is 
already paid with some still 
waiting) from FY02, FY03 I, 
FY03 II, FY04 and FY05 is 
$34,207,459.96.

Santa Ana and Anaheim: 
Both UASIs voluntarily elected to merge strategies 
several years ago, giving way to multiple levels of 
collaboration, information sharing, and 
regionalization. Anaheim was also one of four 
Regional Technology Integration Initiative (RTII) cities, under DHS S&T. 
As a result, almost of the entire city of Anaheim is Wi-Fi and they are 
currently working on getting wireless capabilities within all their response vehicles. Both Santa 
and Anaheim use an EVOC system, emergency virtual operations center, in which the 
responders, incident commanders, and city officials have access to all on-going response activity. 
The system (depending on your access level) provides information to multiple levels of city 
resources, to include GIS maps, tilt-zoom cameras across the city, and both police and fire 
activity. All of this can be accessed through the aforementioned Wi-Fi capability across the city. 
Silicon Valley: 
Support existing Silicon Valley 
Radio Interoperability Project to 
include the ECOMM microwave 
project's extension into 
Monterey, San Benito and Santa 
Cruz counties in support of their 
Public Health Labs. Conduct an 
exercise to test the system 
connection, in accordance with 
HSEEP guidelines.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
The State of Colorado has set aside approximately $30 million in other 
grant funds to continue the building of the Digital Trunk Radio (DTR) 
system in the Western Mountain regions of Colorado. The system is 
approximately 95% complete.   
Colorado through a multi agency, multi disciplinary task force created an 
information sharing and interoperable communications command center 
that houses integrated command and control capacity with information 
analysts in one location.  The Colorado Information Analysis Center (CIAC) is a showcase State 
developed fusion center that serves as a fully integrated hub for communications processing and 
information exchange at all levels of government. It is unique in it’s inclusion of all disciplines 
as well as local participation at this state level fusion center 
The Colorado Department of Emergency Management (DEM) has developed an extensive 
database of state contact 
information (office phone, cell 
phone, fax, pager, home phone) 
which is maintained with the 
assistance of the state 
Emergency Response 
Coordinators. Each State agency 
appoints an Emergency 
Response Coordinator who is 
responsible to maintain current 
contact information with the 
DEM Operations Chief. The 
notification is accomplished 
through a call-down tree
