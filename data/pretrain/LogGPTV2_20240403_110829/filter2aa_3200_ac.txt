### Arizona State Summary

**State Interoperable Communications: DHS Funded Activities (May 2006)**

- **Interoperable Communications Establishment:**
  - Common frequencies have been deployed, and necessary support vehicles have been acquired.
  - These units are now in place across all regions, with ongoing examination and testing.
  - The Arizona Emergency Radio System (AERS) is the primary solution for near-term statewide interoperability, as recommended by the 2005 Statewide Interoperability Project Study.
  - AERS involves the installation of a four-radio suite (VHF, UHF, 800, VHF2) at 45 remote DPS sites throughout Arizona, providing access to a mutual-aid channel for interagency communications.

- **Recent Developments:**
  - Arizona DPS has awarded a contract to reassess capabilities and identify any remaining gaps in communication.
  - This reassessment was prompted by after-action reports from regional and state-level exercises conducted post-deployment of the communication package.
  - ADEM established a public-private partnership with the Arizona Public Service electric company to utilize their statewide 800 MHz trunked communication system.
  - Portable radios have been installed at all County EOCS and the State Emergency Operations Center.

- **Identified Actions:**
  - Five communication vans were purchased to address interoperable communication needs.
  - Arizona continues to enhance its overall communication interoperability system through an integrated and unified approach, leveraging private industry and existing system capabilities.
  - Phoenix UASI has focused on purchasing sophisticated communication equipment, largely funded by DHS, while training, make-ready, and personnel costs are absorbed by the city.
