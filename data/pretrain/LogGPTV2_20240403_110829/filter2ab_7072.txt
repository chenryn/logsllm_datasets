### ATT&CK Technique: Update Software
**ATT&CK ID:** M1051

For Outlook, simply blocking macros may not be effective because the Visual Basic engine used for these features is separate from the macro scripting engine. [9] Microsoft has released several patches to address these issues:

- **KB3191938**: This patch blocks Outlook Visual Basic and displays a warning for malicious code.
- **KB4011091**: This update disables custom forms by default.
- **KB4011162**: This patch removes the legacy Home Page feature.

Ensure that these patches are applied to your systems to enhance security. [10]
