### Table 3: Partial Monlist Table Examples

Table 3 provides two truncated examples of monlist tables returned by an NTP server in response to a `monlist` query, with IP addresses obfuscated for privacy. For clarity, three unrelated columns (local address, client version, and restricted field) have been removed. The remaining columns of interest are:

1. **Remote Address (Client or Victim IP)**
2. **Client Source Port**
3. **Count of Packets**
4. **Client Request Mode**
5. **Average Inter-arrival Time**
6. **Last Seen Time (seconds ago)**

#### Example 1: Monlist Table A

| Remote Address | Src. Port | Count | Mode | Inter-arrival | Last Seen |
|----------------|-----------|-------|------|---------------|-----------|
| ONP-IP         | 57915     | 6     | 7    | 526929        | 0         |
| client.a1      | 10151     | 19    | 6    | 154503        | 310       |
| client.a2      | 123       | 3281  | 4    | 1024          | 345       |
| client.a3      | 54660     | 2     | 7    | 823           | 20795     |
| client.a4      | 36008     | 1     | 3    | 0             | 104063    |

#### Example 2: Monlist Table B

| Remote Address | Src. Port | Count | Mode | Inter-arrival | Last Seen |
|----------------|-----------|-------|------|---------------|-----------|
| ONP-IP         | 47188     | 1     | 7    | 0             | 0         |
| client-b1      | 59436     | 3358227026 | 7 | 0             | 0         |
| client-b2      | 43395     | 25361312   | 7 | 0             | 0         |
| client-b3      | 50231     | 158163232  | 7 | 0             | 0         |
| client.b4      | 80        | 2189  | 7    | 0             | 2         |

### Observations and Analysis

In the first example (Table A), the ONP scanning IP appears at the top of the table, which is typical but not always the case. This may be due to some NTP implementations updating the table only after replying to a probe. The last seen time for the ONP IP is 0 seconds, and the inter-arrival time is around 600,000 seconds, as ONP probes IPs once a week.

The count for our probe is in the single digits, and the mode column shows 7, which, along with mode 6, are special NTP modes that include commands such as `monlist` and `version`.

In addition to the ONP IP, four other clients (client.a1, client.a2, client.a3, and client.a4) have communicated with this server. These clients use request modes 3, 4, 6, and 7, and have last seen times ranging from 29 hours to five minutes ago. 

- **Client 1a** sent 19 packets, approximately every 43 hours, using mode 6, suggesting it is likely another probe. The hostname of this IP confirms it is part of a research project.
- **Client a3** is a benign Internet survey host.
- **Clients a2 and a4** appear to be normal NTP clients, contacting the server over modes 3 and 4 (normal operational modes) and using expected source ports and inter-arrival times.

In the second example (Table B), we again see the ONP probe packet. Four client IPs, each using mode 7, have average inter-arrival times of 0 seconds and were last seen within the last second. Some of these clients have very high packet counts, with one showing over 3 billion packets. These clients appear to be victims of the example amplifier. One of the clients is using source port 80, which, for UDP, is not a well-known service port but is commonly targeted, as revealed by our victim port analysis (Section 4.3.2).

### Monlist Table Analysis

For each week of ONP data, we parsed the responses to ONP `monlist` probes from each amplifier, resulting in 5 million amplifier-week pairs. We used the protocol logic found in the NTP `ntpdc` tool to rebuild the monlist tables present in the captured packets. If an amplifier sent repeated copies of the table, we used the final table received on that sample day.

For each client IP in each table, we classified the client into one of three categories: non-victim, scanner/low-volume victim, or apparent victim of the amplifier.

- **Non-Victim**: If the mode value was less than 6.
- **Scanner/Low-Volume Victim**: If the client sent fewer than three packets or the average inter-arrival time was greater than 3600 seconds.
- **Victim**: If the client sent more than three packets and averaged more than one packet per hour.

We only report results for victims, limiting our reporting to those above a low threshold of packets. No legitimate NTP client would send these mode packets in normal operation, and individual researchers are unlikely to re-scan a given IP more than once per hour.

For each victim, we extracted the packet count, average inter-arrival time, and last seen time. We estimated the duration of attacks using the packet count multiplied by the average inter-arrival time. The start time was estimated using the calculated duration and the time the table was received by the ONP scanner.

### View Provided by Tables

Across all ONP weekly samples, the median largest last seen time in the monlist tables is about 44 hours. This suggests that our samples will underestimate the number of victims, packets, or attacks by a factor of 3.8. The largest last seen time in tables shrinks between the first sample in January and the peak of attacks in mid-February, then increases again, following the same pattern seen in other measurements (e.g., Internet NTP traffic). Therefore, our February peaks likely underestimate attacks more than in lower-volume months.

### Victims and Attacks

We next seek to understand who is the target of NTP DDoS attacks, when attacks occurred, how long the attacks lasted, and whether we see evidence for any public attacks.

#### Victim Locations and Networks

Our victim list includes victims from 184 countries across six continents. At peak, the victim population spans up to 33,000 routed blocks and 6,700 ASes. About half of the victims are end-host IPs, though this has grown from 31% on January 10th. The average number of IPs attacked in routed blocks is between 3â€“5, suggesting most attacks target a small number of selected hosts in targeted organizations. This adds evidence to the idea that many DDoS attacks are launched against individuals.

Figure 5 shows a CDF of the contribution of victim packets by autonomous system for both amplifiers and victim ASes. Just 100 amplifier ASes are responsible for 60% of the victim packets measured. Victim ASes are even more concentrated, with the top 100 ASes receiving three-quarters of all attack packets. Among the top ten ASes, eight are hosting providers and two are telecom companies. The top attacked AS is French hosting firm OVH, the purported target of large NTP DDoS attacks in mid-February (see Section 4.4).

#### Attacked Ports

We tallied the source port used for each victim seen at each amplifier. Table 4 shows the top 20 attacked ports, along with the count of amplifier/victim pairs and the fraction of all. We also include a column describing the common use of each port, where known.
