This feature appears straightforward to implement, but I would like to confirm whether the `ListItem` component should include a prop for specifying the number of secondary text lines, similar to the `0.x` version. Specifically, the prop could be defined as:
```javascript
secondaryTextLines: PropTypes.oneOf([1, 2])
```
This would support 3-line list items, in accordance with the Material Design specification.

I have thoroughly searched the repository's issues and believe that this request is not a duplicate.

Feel free to let me know if you need any further adjustments!
