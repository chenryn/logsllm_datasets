OVER mmWAVE 5G
Previous sections have shown that mmWave 5G is able to provide
ultra-high throughput but requires more power to deliver this per-
formance. On the other hand, low-band 5G or LTE uses much less
power but delivers lower performance than mmWave. Hence, there
is a trade-off between achieving high performance and energy effi-
ciency. To get better insights about this trade-off, in this section we
use web browsing as a case study to understand the QoE implica-
tions of radio type (e.g., 4G or mmWave 5G) used to load websites
in-the-wild.
Data Collection Methodology. Using chrome-har-capturer [14],
we build scripts to instrument and load Alexa’s top 1500 websites
via the Chrome Browser app. For each website, we collect HTTP
Archive (i.e., HAR [1]) files as well as capture the packet traces.
Since packet capturing requires root permission, we used PX5.We

conduct this experiment under stationary conditions in two radio
settings: (i) mmWave 5G is active, (ii) 4G/LTE is active. mmWave-
based experiments were conducted with UE having LoS to 5G tower.
We repeat the experiment at least 8 times per device per radio type.
To eliminate the impact of browser cache, we clear the cache before
loading the next website.
The HAR file of each website loading provides us the total page
load time (PLT), time to fetch each individual object (e.g., images,
.css or .js files) associated with the website, etc. We also extract
the per-second throughput trace observed in the packet dumps. This
trace is then fed to our power model proposed in §4 to estimate the
radio’s energy consumption for loading the website. All references
to 5G in this section refer to Verizon mmWave 5G service.
permissible penalty in PLT (caused by choosing 4G) leads to high
energy savings. To understand where such a permissible penalty
might lie depends on how much additional delay in PLT is permis-
sible such that there is no significant impact on user experiences.
For example, a 2s or less PLT remains a widely considered golden
standard [44] for web page load times. An average 4G throughput
of say 60 Mbps can theoretically load a website with a total page

in deciding the radio type: (1) the total page size in bytes, and
(2) the proportion of dynamic vs. static objects (e.g., ads vs. logos)
In contrast, when energy utilization is preferred (M4), 4G radio can
handle more websites while 5G will be the preferred radio when the
website has an extremely high number of dynamic objects (>76%)
compared to static objects. By feeding the web packet traces into
our constructed power model (§4), we find that interface selection
help save 15-66% energy while improving the overall QoE. The
dynamic 4G/5G switching scheme proposed in [59] brings a 25%
saving on energy but does not consider the page load time.
7 RELATED WORK
5G Measurements. Xu et al. [59] did a measurement study of a
commercial mid-band 5G service in China. Narayanan et al. [39]
established baseline performance of the very initial 5G commercial
deployments (mmWave and mid-band) in the US. Lumos5G [40]
focused on mmWave 5G throughput characterization and proposed
machine learning models for throughput prediction. In our study,
we consider both mmWave and low-band 5G with wider-range of
5G smartphone models and server locations. We also conduct the
first measurement study of an operational SA 5G service.
5G RRC Parameters. Existing work have made various efforts
to investigate RRC state machine for 3G/4G [31, 48, 51]. For 5G,
Xu et al. [59] leverages the UE’s diagnostic interface to access lower-
layer signaling messages and monitor RRC state transitions. Access
to the diagnostic interface requires special license from the chipset
vendor which can be challenging and cost-prohibitive. We there-
fore use an unrooted approach (i.e., RRC-Probe) to infer RRC state
machine for both NSA and SA 5G.
5G Power Characteristics. 3G/4G power characteristics have
been extensively studied in literature [24, 31, 47, 52] while 5G power
characteristics remain under explored. Xu et al. [59] conducted a pre-
liminary measurement study to understand mid-band 5G’s power
consumption and energy efficiency by saturating the link capacity
and compare it with that of 4G/LTE. They used a software power
monitor to measure power consumption. In this paper, along with a
software-based approach, we also use a hardware power monitor to
measure power. We provide a more thorough characterization of 5G
power consumption for both: mmWave/high-band and low-band
5G, and compare with that of existing 4G/LTE. Our methodology
to characterize power consumption includes both: conducting con-
trolled (e.g., at different uplink/downlink target throughput) and
in-the-wild (e.g., stationary and walking) experiments.
Smartphone Power Modeling. Prior studies have built power
models for 3G [47, 48, 55, 65] and 4G/LTE [26, 31, 42]. Some focus
on energy consumption for video streaming [63, 64] and web page
load [23]. However, when modeling power during data transfer, they
either treat the network power as a constant value or only consider a
single impacting factor such as throughput or signal strength during
model construction. For 5G, several factors can together make a
significant impact on the smartphone power level, and different
5G technologies relying on different radio frequency bands also
incur different power consumption. In this paper, we model the
data transfer power considering factors including signal strength
and throughput and further show that power model characteristics
vary across different 5G bands.
Mobile Video Streaming. Video delivery over LTE has been widely
investigated [36, 57, 60, 69]. However, video streaming performance
over real commercial 5G networks (especially over mmWave) has
been largely under explored. Xu et al. [59] performed a prelimi-
nary study of UHD panoramic video telephony over mid-band 5G.
Han et al. [28] showcased an example of streaming volumetric/6D
video over a mmWave 5G network under line-of-sight condition.
There have also been efforts on evaluating the performance of dif-
ferent ABR algorithms for HTTP adaptive streaming [21, 37, 38, 61].
Nevertheless, none of them have examined the performance of
existing ABR algorithms over 5G. Researchers also observe that
better throughput prediction can improve video performance in cel-
lular networks [71]. This is even more important for 5G ecosystem
that supports a wide range of frequency bands with diverse cover-
age and performance characteristics. For instance, in the case of
mmWave 5G, performance can be greatly affected by environmental
and user-side factors [39, 40]. Xu et al. [59] did a preliminary study
on optimizing 5G power management by dynamically switching
between 4G and 5G interfaces. However, their goal was to solely
improve energy efficiency, not for application QoE.
Mobile Web Browsing. Previous studies mostly focus on under-
standing and improving web page loading over legacy 3G/4G net-
works [22, 46, 58]. Narayanan et al. [39] studied web page loading
performance with different HTTP protocol version numbers and
encryption configurations using mmWave 5G. Xu et al. [59] looked
into the downloading and rendering performance with different
types of websites using mid-band 5G. Our study includes a compre-
hensive examination of the performance and energy consumption
loading top websites using 5G, and proposes simple yet intelligent
interface selection schemes to satisfy different QoE goals.
8 CONCLUSION
Leveraging a custom measurement platform, we have conducted
comprehensive measurements of several key aspects of commercial
5G: end-to-end network performance, power characteristics, 4G/5G
interaction, and application QoE. Our findings reveal the state-of-
the-art landscape of the 5G ecosystem, in particular the higher
protocol stack. We have released our datasets and measurement
tools to the research community.
