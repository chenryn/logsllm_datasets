When you install .exe files generated from Python scripts, you often encounter an installation manager with a blue interface and a "Python Powered" logo. This installer is likely created using one of the following tools:

1. **`bdist_wininst` Command**: This is part of the `distutils` module in Python, which allows you to create Windows installers.
2. **`bdist_msi` Command**: Also part of `distutils`, this command generates Microsoft Installer (MSI) packages.
3. **`py2exe`**: A third-party tool that builds on `distutils` to convert Python scripts into standalone Windows executables.

If you want to create similar installable Python files, you can use any of these tools. For example, `py2exe` is a popular choice for creating `.exe` files from Python scripts. You can find detailed documentation and examples for each of these tools online to help you get started.
