Given \( P(X_A \leq p) = 1 - \gamma \), and with \( PK_3 \) and \( \alpha = p \), one can assign \( \phi \) the value \( \varphi - \gamma \), which is the smallest (i.e., most conservative) value of \( \phi \) consistent with \( \varphi \) and \( \gamma \). Here, \( \gamma \) could be the result of previously applying CBI to version A (Section III).

We demonstrated in Section VII that different forms of PK can lead to varying levels of confidence in a claim. Some forms require fewer failure-free demands than others to support a given claim. It is crucial not to exploit this knowledge to select PKs that yield the most favorable results, as this would be both unethical and dangerous. The choice of PKs must be based solely on prior evidence.

In some cases, obtaining additional evidence to enhance confidence may be costly. For example, determining the appropriate \( \phi \) value might necessitate analyzing extensive logs from past projects. A decision must then be made about whether the added confidence justifies the significant cost. Our results can inform such considerations.

We observe that parameter values sometimes need not be specified with great precision. For instance, if CII supporting evidence is relatively weak (i.e., \( \theta > \varphi > 1 - \theta \)), meaning the confidence in B being an improvement is less than the confidence that A and B meet their "engineering goal," the posterior confidence and the required \( n_A \) and \( n_B \) to support a claim do not depend on \( \varphi \).

Our focus has been on CBI priors (parameter values for the PKs) that are consistent with practical expectations. For example, we assumed a confidence higher than 50% (i.e., \( \theta > 1 - \theta \)) that the engineering goal is met, as system development would not typically commence with lower confidence.

We have not considered the case where \( p < \varepsilon \), i.e., a required bound on \( pfd \) lower than the value one has some confidence of achieving. Previous studies have shown that this may result in zero posterior confidence unless additional prior knowledge is provided about values of \( pfd \) smaller than \( p \) [7,9].

A broader observation is appropriate regarding the worst-case priors produced by CBI. For example, as shown in Figure 8, increasing \( n_A \) eventually undermines confidence in a claim, requiring a corresponding increase in \( n_B \) to compensate. This is because the worst-case priors include a probability mass at point \( (p_l, p) \), implying a belief that "if A turns out to be extremely good, then B must be inadequate, but just inadequate enough not to achieve the desired \( pfd \), \( p \)." Such a belief, while not refuted by any of the forms of PK 1 to 4, is generally not supported by experience. We now discuss the implications of such apparently unreasonable worst-case priors.

If, after following the recommended steps, the resulting worst-case prior seems absurd, possible reasons include: 1) the analysis may be inadequate, requiring additional PK to capture neglected implications of the evidence [9,21,22]; 2) the prior, although absurd, may be a limiting case of a class of plausible priors; 3) the "absurdity" of the results may flag an error in deriving the PKs from the evidence or in our likelihood function, etc.

Section VII also highlights how strongly supported CII can increase confidence in posterior claims or reduce the required \( n_B \) for a given level of confidence. However, when \( n_A \) is small, all worst-case priors require a larger \( n_B \) than when making the same claim on B using a "single-system" CBI prior (see discussion of Figure 8).

We also highlight that having \( \theta \times 100\% \) confidence for both versions brings a noticeable increase in posterior confidence, as seen in the difference between the prior from Figure 3a (only A version) and the prior from Figure 3b (both versions) in Figure 13. This is true when \( n_A \) is not the value \( n^*_A \) that guarantees the greatest posterior confidence. If \( n_A = n^*_A \), having \( \theta \) for both versions brings no benefit; what matters then is the form of CII. Knowing \( n^*_A \) tells us the maximum additional confidence a claim for B could have, all else being equal.

Finally, unlike ordinary Bayesian inference, in CBI, the form of prior used needs to depend on the input values. For example, up to about \( n_A = 10^8 \), the dotted curve in Figure 8 is generated by the prior in Figure 4b. Beyond that point, it is generated by the new worst-case prior in Figure 4a. These priors are very different, and erroneously using only one for all \( n_A \) would give significantly over-optimistic results.

### Future Work

The forms of formal "prior knowledge" we have studied are chosen to be realistic but do not exhaust all possibilities. Case studies, especially those applying the kind of scrutiny we have outlined when CBI produces apparently unreasonable worst-case priors, may reveal other forms of prior evidence that can reduce excess conservatism. In this direction, a purely mathematical next step is to find a solution that fully exploits the form of claim in Example 3 (Section IV), requiring (6) to hold for every subinterval in [0, 1]. Using this form of CII to address Example 3 would provide more confidence in claims on \( pfd \) compared to approximating it with PK 4.

We have focused on scenarios where no failures occurred, which is sensible for certification in critical systems regarding systematic failures. If a software failure occurs, the system is fixed and reassessed from scratch. If this reassessment ignores the fault in the previous version, it may undermine assumptions and result in over-optimistic conclusions [25]. Therefore, it would be useful to extend the present work to assess version B given failures in version A, or for less critical systems, given failures in both A and B.

Some aspects of the mathematical apparatus can be easily completed if needed. For instance, we do not explicitly account for the joint probability of both versions satisfying the engineering goal. There may be reasons for believing either positive or negative correlation between the two events. Studying these effects may provide more insight into useful forms of PK that are currently missing. Additionally, in our scenarios, the same \( \theta \times 100\% \) confidence applies to both versions. In practice, the two could be different (e.g., due to different development approaches or operational environments).

Thus far, CBI applications have involved solving constrained mathematical optimizations over sets of prior probability distributions, capturing the uncertainty an assessor has in specifying beliefs justified by prior evidence. The assessor could also have uncertainty in specifying the probabilistic failure model for the failure-free observations (i.e., the likelihood function). Extending CBI to assess the effects of such uncertainty would be a fruitful exercise.

### Summary of Contributions

In this paper, we have reported: 1) how various practical scenarios map into formal "prior knowledge" (PK) statements for use in conservative Bayesian inference (CBI); 2) convenient closed-form solutions for the worst-case priors and for the posterior confidence in claimed \( pfd \) bounds; 3) sensitivity analyses identifying parameter ranges for which evidence from operation in system or environment A reduces the amount \( n_B \) of failure-free operation required in system or environment B for a required confidence in a bound.

Together with our previous work [6,7], by introducing new examples based on practical scenarios, this paper demonstrates how CBI can be used to formalize arguments that use claims like "proven in use" (PIU), "Globally at least equivalent" (GALE), or "stress tested" â€” claims derived from operation/test evidence on related, but not identical, environments of use or system versions. These examples serve as a guide when translating other forms of prior evidence into formally stated CBI constraints ("PK"s).
