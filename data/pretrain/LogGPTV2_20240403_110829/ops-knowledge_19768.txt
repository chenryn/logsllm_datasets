User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to find connected hosts at network (vpn or lan) I have posted this same thing at stackOverflow and someone pointed me at the fact that this should be here instead...

I'm looking for possible solutions to the following need:

I have a VPN configured (using openVPN over Linux, BTW), and I want to know at any moment which hosts are connected to it. I recognize that it probably is the same thing as trying to know which hosts are connected to a lan, so any of the solutions might do the job...

The fact is that I once used a hamachi vpn on linux and with it I had the chance to know which hosts were connected to a particular network where I belonged, so I was wondering if something similar might be possible in openVPN (or even any VPN and/or any LAN).

Preferably, I'm looking for opensource/free sw solutions, or maybe the hints to program it myself (in the most simple way if possible, not that I don't know how to program, but I'm trying to achieve this in a simple manner). But anyway, if there are no os/fsw solutions, any other one might do...

Thanks a lot!

ok! thanks for you reply

I'm trying to deploy the management interface, but I'm facing some trouble I don't know how to handle.

I added the following line to my server conf file:

management 10.8.0.1 2308 /etc/openvpn/password


I am sure port 2308 is unused, and 10.8.0.1 happens to be the address openVPN gives to my server (am I right with this? perhaps I understood this upside down :( ) and I echoed a password of my choice into the password file.

After restarting openvpn I get this:

MANAGEMENT: Cannot bind TCP socket on 10.8.0.1:2308: Cannot assign requested address (errno=99)


any ideas?

Assistant: In your OpenVPN server.conf file, include the directive: "status /var/log/openvpn-status.log" if it's not there already. (Restart OpenVPN if you do have to make this change.)

...Then, to see what hosts are connected remotely:

$ cat /var/log/openvpn-status.log

You'll get something like this:
