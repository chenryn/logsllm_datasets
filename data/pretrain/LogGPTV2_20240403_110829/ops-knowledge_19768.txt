**Query: How to Identify Connected Hosts on a Network (VPN or LAN)**

I have posted this question on Stack Overflow, but was directed here for a more appropriate response.

**Background and Requirements:**

I have an OpenVPN configuration set up on a Linux system. My goal is to be able to identify, at any given time, which hosts are connected to this VPN. I understand that the process might be similar to identifying connected hosts on a local area network (LAN), so any solution that works for either scenario would be helpful.

Previously, I used Hamachi on Linux, which provided a feature to list all connected hosts in a specific network. I am wondering if there is a similar capability available in OpenVPN or other types of VPNs and LANs.

**Preferred Solutions:**

1. **Open-Source/Free Software Solutions:** I am primarily looking for open-source or free software solutions.
2. **Programming Hints:** If no such solutions exist, I am open to programming my own solution. Any simple and straightforward guidance would be appreciated.
3. **Other Solutions:** If neither of the above options is feasible, I am open to other suggestions.

**Additional Context:**

I attempted to deploy the management interface for OpenVPN by adding the following line to my server configuration file:

```plaintext
management 10.8.0.1 2308 /etc/openvpn/password
```

- I verified that port 2308 is unused.
- `10.8.0.1` is the IP address assigned to my OpenVPN server.
- I created a password file at `/etc/openvpn/password` with a chosen password.

After restarting OpenVPN, I encountered the following error:

```plaintext
MANAGEMENT: Cannot bind TCP socket on 10.8.0.1:2308: Cannot assign requested address (errno=99)
```

Any ideas on how to resolve this issue?

**Alternative Solution:**

In your OpenVPN `server.conf` file, ensure the following directive is included (if not already present):

```plaintext
status /var/log/openvpn-status.log
```

Restart the OpenVPN service if you make this change.

To view the list of connected clients remotely, use the following command:

```bash
$ cat /var/log/openvpn-status.log
```

This will provide output similar to the following:

```plaintext

I hope this helps!
