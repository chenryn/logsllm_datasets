  * Electron version: 2.0.0-beta.1
  * Operating system: masOS High Sierra 10.13.4 Beta (17E150g)
### Expected behavior
When I clicked one of the Menu Items, the click function should be triggered.
### Actual behavior

After clicking the menu item, nothing happened. However, I've tested on Window
10 and it worked fine.
### How to reproduce
Just clone https://github.com/qazbnm456/electron-quick-start and run.  
When clicking the only entry on the context menu, there's no any message
logged in the console panel.
