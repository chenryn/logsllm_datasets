The LocalSessionFactory bean currently has no way to set listeners on the
SessionFactory (via the Configuration.setListener) method. This should as
simple as accepting a map as a property of the LocalSessionFactoryBean, and
when building the Configuration object, iterating through it, and calling
Configuration.setListener on each iteration.
