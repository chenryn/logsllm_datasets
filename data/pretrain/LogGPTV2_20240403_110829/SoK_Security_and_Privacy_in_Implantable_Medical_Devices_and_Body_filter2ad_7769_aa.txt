I. INTRODUCTION
The integration of computing devices and health care has
changed the landscape of modern medicine. Implantable
medical devices (IMDs), or medical devices embedded inside
the human body, have made it possible to continuously
and automatically manage a number of health conditions,
ranging from cardiac arrhythmia to Parkinson’s disease.
Body area networks (BANs), wireless networks of wearable
computing devices, enable remote monitoring of a patient’s
health status.
In 2001, the estimated number of patients in the United
States with an IMD exceeded 25 million [1]; reports from
2005 estimate the number of patients with insulin pumps at
245,000 [2], [3]. IMDs have become pervasive, spurred by
the increased energy efﬁciency and low cost of embedded
systems, making it possible to provide real-time monitoring
and treatment of patients [4]. Low power system optimiza-
tions [5], ultra-low-power wireless connectivity [6], and
the development of numerous lightweight communication
protocols (e.g., on-demand MAC) [7]–[9] have helped make
small-scale sense-actuate systems like IMDs and BANs a
reality. Through sensors, these systems can collect a range of
physiological values (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen
saturation, temperature, or neural activity) and can provide
appropriate actuation or treatment (e.g., regulate heart rate or
halt tremors). On-board radios enable wireless data transfer
(or wireless medical telemetry [10]) for monitoring and con-
ﬁguration without sacriﬁcing patient mobility or requiring
surgical procedures to physically access the devices.
The need for security and privacy of medical devices has
received increasing attention in both the media and the aca-
demic community over the last few years—a perhaps telling
example is the recent revelation that Vice President Dick
Cheney had the wireless telemetry interface on his implanted
pacemaker disabled [11]. In the academic community, the
seminal work by Halperin et al. [12], which introduces a
class of wireless threats against a commercial implantable
cardiac deﬁbrillator (ICD), has been followed by numerous
papers researching techniques to improve the security and
privacy of medical devices.
Even though the likelihood of targeted adversarial attacks
on IMDs and BANs may be debatable, the consequences of
an insecure system can be severe. Indeed, Fu and Blum [13]
observe that while the hacking of medical devices is a “red
herring”, poor security design can result in real vulnerabil-
ities. For example, the existence of malware on networked
medical devices can result in unreliable data or actuation,
impacting both the integrity and availability of the systems
in question. Any private data on the system may be exposed,
leading to a breach of conﬁdentiality.
Although traditionally there has been little incentive for
medical device manufacturers to incorporate security and
privacy mechanisms for fear of inhibiting regulatory ap-
proval [14], the FDA has recently called for manufacturers
to address cybersecurity issues relevant to medical devices
for the entire life cycle of the device, from the initial design
phase through deployment and end-of-life [15]. Although
these calls are in the form of draft guidelines for ensuring
appropriate medical device security, there is evidence that
the FDA means to use these guidelines as grounds for
rejection of premarket medical device submissions [16].

than in the traditional computer
science setting. As
Halperin et al. [17] observe, the security and privacy goals
of IMDs may at times conﬂict with the safety and utility
of these devices. For example, eavesdropping on commu-
nications between an IMD and its programmer may reveal
a sensitive medical condition, or querying an IMD with an
unauthenticated programmer may allow clandestine tracking,
both of which compromise the privacy of the affected
patient. Unauthenticated communication can lead to denial
of service attacks, in which legitimate communication is
prevented from reaching the device or the device’s battery
is needlessly depleted [12], as well as replay and injection
attacks, in which potentially dangerous commands sent to
the device can alter the patient’s therapy [12], [18], [19]. On
the other hand, using traditional cryptographic mechanisms
to ensure secure communication and storage of data can
compromise the safety of the patient. If the patient needs
treatment outside of his normal health care context (e.g.,

Balancing security, privacy, safety, and utility is a ne-
cessity in the health care domain [14]. Multiple academic
disciplines (e.g., embedded systems, computer security, and
medicine) have independently explored the IMD/BAN prob-
lem space. We go beyond related work [17], [19], [20] by
providing a comprehensive overview of security and privacy
trends and emerging threats, in order to facilitate uptake by
research groups and industry.

Halperin et al. [17] and Zhang et al. [20]. By identifying and
analyzing popular research trends in this space, we observe
that current work may be roughly subdivided into three
classes: the security of the wireless telemetry, detection and
prevention of software vulnerabilities, and the security of
the hardware architecture and sensor interface. Our catego-
rization allows us to easily trace the evolution of IMD/BAN
research, connect current work to related notions from the
ﬁeld of RFID security and privacy, and identify emerging
threats in this space.
We identify challenges computer science researchers face
in examining the security and privacy of medical devices,
including the lack of reproducibility of research results.
Access to medical devices is a common problem that limits
researchers’ ability to validate prior results; food-grade meat
as a phantom also complicates reproducibility due to its inac-
curate approximation of a human body [8], [21]. In addition,
we provide clear deﬁnitions of IMDs and BANs and describe
the relevant communications standards, including clarifying
the term medical device, which is strictly deﬁned by the
FDA. The distinction between a medical device and a device
used in the context of health (e.g., FitBit, a popular tool to
track physical activity) is a common source of confusion.
In the IMD/BAN space, we need to achieve trustworthy
communication, trustworthy software, and trustworthy hard-
ware and sensor interfaces. While the security of the wireless
telemetry interface has received much attention in academia,
both the threat of software exploits in medical devices and
the security and privacy of the sensor interface are areas of
research that deserve further attention. Subtle eavesdropping
and injection attacks on sensor inputs, such as the work
by Foo Kune et al. [22] on cardiac implantable electrical
devices (CIEDs), which include pacemakers and deﬁbrilla-
tors, and Bagade et al. [23] on compromising the privacy
of physiological inputs to key generation mechanisms, are a
promising avenue of future work.
II. PAPER ORGANIZATION
We provide relevant deﬁnitions and background informa-
tion on IMDs and BANs in Section III and outline security
and privacy goals and our adversarial model in Section IV.
In Section V, we give a breakdown of the state of the
art in IMD/BAN research and analyze current trends. We
then discuss research challenges speciﬁc to the IMD/BAN
domain and identify emerging threats in Section VI. We give
concluding remarks in Section VII.
III. BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS
Advances in embedded systems [24] and wireless sensor
networks (WSNs) [25] have made modern IMDs and BANs
possible. Current embedded systems trade computing per-
formance and memory resources for energy efﬁciency and
lower costs. Wireless sensor networks link both homoge-
neous and heterogeneous autonomous devices. WSNs have
been used for health care monitoring via the introduction
of both wearable and implanted sensor networks [5], [26],
giving rise to modern healthcare-related BANs.
A. Implantable Medical Devices and Body Area Networks
The U.S. FDA has a broad, albeit relatively strict, deﬁni-
tion of medical devices, which range from tongue depressors
to MRI machines. The U.S. Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic
Act [27, Section 201(h)] deﬁnes a medical device as an in-
strument, apparatus, machine, or other similar article which
is a) ofﬁcially recognized by national registries; b) intended
for use in the diagnosis, cure, or prevention of a disease; and
c) intended to affect the structure or function of the body. We
emphasize that in order for a device to qualify as a medical
device,
it must undergo substantial review by the FDA
before being released on the commercial market; we use
this deﬁnition of medical device in this paper. The FDA also
has signiﬁcant global inﬂuence through arrangements with
numerous foreign government organizations [28]; therefore
devices, standards, and protocols used in the U.S. are likely
to be of interest to other countries as well.
The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
deﬁnes wireless medical telemetry in FCC 00-211 [29, Sec-
tion 3B] and FCC 47 CFR 95.401 [10] as the measurement

and recording of physiological values via wireless signals.
The wireless medical
telemetry system is comprised of
sensors, radio-based communication, and recording devices.
In this paper, we use the phrase wireless telemetry, or simply
telemetry, to mean radio-based communication, as in the
FCC deﬁnition; this is distinct from the traditional RFID
deﬁnition of telemetry, which comprises data collection and
transmission.
1) Implantable medical devices: We deﬁne an im-
plantable medical device (IMD) as one which is surgically
placed inside of a patient’s body. Figure 1 provides examples
of IMDs and an IMD programmer (or simply, programmer),
and shows the high-level communication protocol of an ICD.
The programmer in this context is an external device with
an interface (usually a radio frequency (RF) transceiver) for
communicating wirelessly with an IMD and relaying data to
a device used by clinicians or other health care providers.
An IMD system supports:
• Analog front end, the signal conditioning circuitry for
application-speciﬁc sensing and actuation;
• Memory and storage, for storing personal health infor-
mation and sensed data;
• Microprocessor, for executing device-speciﬁc software;
• Telemetry interface, often radio-based, for transmitting
data between the device and a programmer or other
sensor/actuator on the patient; and
• Power management, for monitoring and managing bat-
tery use for increased longevity.
IMDs are resource-constrained, requiring reduced size,
weight, low peak power and low duty cycle. Past research
uses resource-constrained hardware platforms such as an 8-
bit Atmel-AVR and a 16-bit TI MSP430 [30] to model IMD
conﬁgurations. The TI MSP430F1611 consumes energy at
approximately 0.72 nJ per clock cycle. Typical IMDs are
designed to last 90 months on a single battery with 0.5 A h
to 2 A h of battery life [31]. These requirements minimize
the impact of invasive surgeries to replace depleted implants.
526
Furthermore, modern IMDs rely on low-power radio com-
munication and network connectivity to provide a remote-
monitoring system [14]. The FCC has allocated the 401 MHz
to 406 MHz band for Medical Devices (MedRadio) [32],
sometimes called the Medical Implant Communication Ser-
vice (MICS) band. This band is currently used for IMD
wireless telemetry.
The MICS band allows for reasonable signal propagation
through the human body without interfering with other de-
vices. Additionally, it allows for a greater distance between
the patient and external transceiver, unlike previous IMDs
(e.g., a pacemaker transmitting at 175 kHz, which required
a proximity within 5 cm [9]).
2) Body area networks: We deﬁne a body area network
(BAN) as a wireless network of heterogeneous computing
devices that are wearable. This network enables continuous
remote monitoring of patient physiological values in the
medical setting. In this work, we are mainly concerned with
BANs as they relate to IMDs.
BANs typically include three types of devices: sensors,
actuators, and a sink. In Figure 2, sensors are placed at
various locations on the body, support multiple network
topologies, and forward sensed data to a more computation-
ally powerful device (e.g., a smartphone). Although related
to wireless sensor networks, BANs exhibit some notable
differences [33] with respect to wearability (e.g., size and
power), battery availability, and transmission (i.e., the human
body is a lossy medium). Moreover, reliability requirements
may be stricter than in a typical wireless sensor network,
depending on how safety-critical the application.
As we are most
interested in BANs as they relate
to IMDs, we only give a brief overview of the com-
munication standards for clinical environments [34]. The
ISO/IEEE 11073 [35] standard spans the entire BAN com-
munication stack, while Health Level 7 (HL7) [36], In-
tegrating the Health Enterprise (IHE) [37] and the recent
ASTM F2761 (MDPnP) [38] standard only describe the
