User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: python -m pip

really works for the problem Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using '"'.Worked on Windows 10
