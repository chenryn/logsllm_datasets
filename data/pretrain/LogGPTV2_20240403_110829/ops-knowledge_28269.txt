User: I recently discovered that an outdated version of Python was causing my Wx app to run into errors.
I can't install Python 2.7.3 on my Mac, and when I tried it in a virtual machine, py2app was still "compiling" the app after running overnight (my Windows/Linux box has an â‰ˆ1GHz processor).
Is there a version of py2app that runs on Windows?
Assistant: No, There's no way on earth you can run py2app on windows,py2app cannot create a Mac app bundle in windows because it's impossible to do so... Either hackintosh your pc or emulate a mac using QEMU,VMware or VirtualBox!
