terprise networks, content/cloud providers, and academic networks.
For these ASes, we are reasonably certain that the administrators
do not willingly engage in repeated hostile activity.
Serial Hijacker ASes: Finding ground truth on serial hijacker
ASes is a more difficult task: we process 5 years worth of email
threads on the NANOG [6] mailing list and extract 23 AS numbers
for which network operators repeatedly disclosed hijacking events.
We note that for each of these ASes the email threads included
several address blocks that had recently been (or were being) hi-
jacked. Furthermore, in 4 cases, hijacker ASes were mentioned in
connection to hijacking events spanning multiple years.
2Later in § 6 we only leverage MANRS ASes that have originated at least 10 prefixes
in the 5 years considered in our study.

In the remainder of this paper, we use the set of Legitimate ASes
and Serial Hijacker ASes to first study the dominant characteristics
of serial hijackers in § 5, and to later train a classifier to identify
these characteristics in the larger AS population in § 6.
3.2 Longitudinal BGP Dataset
We base our study on snapshots taken from the global routing table
computed every 5 minutes over a time period of 5 years, leveraging
historical BGP data from all available RIPE and RouteViews collec-
tors. Starting on January 1st, 2014 and ending in December 31, 2018,
we build an individual routing table for each peer (network that
feeds into any of the collectors) of each collector every 5 minutes
using RIB dumps and BGP updates received over the respective
peer-collector BGP sessions. For each of these routing tables, we
extract prefix and origin AS numbers to generate 5 minute snap-
shots listing prefix-origin AS pairs (prefix-origins in the following)
together with the count of peers observing them. Each snapshot
file contains between 560,000 and 1,240,000 prefix-origin pairs. We
obtain 288 files per day, 525,888 snapshot files in total. Across the
entirety of our dataset covering 5 years, we find 7,370,019 unique
prefix-origins to be advertised by at least one peer. We find a to-
tal of 76,769 unique ASes and 6,044,333 unique prefixes. Table 1
summarizes the main properties of the dataset.
4 DATA PREPROCESSING
In this section, we describe the necessary steps to de-noise our
dataset, and to convert individual snapshots into aggregated prefix-
origin timelines for further analysis.
4.1 Dataset De-Noising
Variability of BGP peer availability: We leverage the count of
peers that see and propagate an individual prefix-origin pair as
a proxy for the prefix-origin visibility in the global routing table.
Figure 2a shows the maximum visibility of IPv4 and IPv6 prefix-
origin pairs in each snapshot file, i.e., the maximum number of
peers that reported the same prefix-origin pair to any of the RIPE
or RouteViews collectors. Over the course of 5 years, the maximum
visibility increases from the 250-300 range for IPv4 and 160-210
range for IPv6 in 2014 to 400-500 (IPv4) and 300-400 (IPv6) in 2018,
mainly a result of increasing participation of networks in the BGP
collection infrastructure. However, we see constant variability, e.g.,
caused by lost BGP sessions between peers and collectors, or out-
ages of individual collectors. Indeed, we find a number of episodes
of significant reduction in the number of peers with active connec-
tions to collectors. During the 5 year period, the lowest maximum
peer count is 83 for IPv4 and 102 for IPv6. In order to reduce the
impact of significant peer disconnections and other BGP collector
infrastructure problems, for IPv4 and IPv6, we do not consider a
snapshot file if the maximum peer count drops below 20% of the
median maximum peer count of the previous week for the same
protocol. In total, for the 5 year period, we ignore 1332 (for IPv4)
and 1598 (for IPv6) snapshot files, representing 0.25% and 0.30% of
all available files respectively.
Highly localized BGP advertisements: In every snapshot file,
we find prefix-origin pairs with very low visibility. These BGP
advertisements can either be the result of highly localized traffic
engineering efforts or related to misconfigurations and errors of
the collector infrastructure itself or of a single, or a few, of their
connected peers (recall that the total number of peers ranges be-
tween 300 and 500 for IPv4 during our measurement period). We
remove prefix-origin pairs that were seen by 5 or less peers. While
we specifically track both low-visibility and high-visibility prefix
advertisements in this work, these cases of very low visibility are
unlikely to represent actual routing events of interest for this study.
We find that, on average, of all prefix-origin pairs of a snapshot file,
less than 20% of IPv4 and 15% of IPv6 prefix-origin pairs are seen
by 5 or less peers, but point out that they represent only 0.09% of
IPv4 and 0.1% of IPv6 prefix-origins found in the routing tables of
BGP collectors’ peers at the time of the snapshot. Two thirds of the
low-visibility IPv4 prefix-origins are announcements more specific
than /24, and three quarters of IPv6 prefix-origins more specific
than /48. Table 2 summarizes the properties of the cleaned routing
dataset for IPv4 and IPv6. We note that although filtering very low
visibility prefix-origins reduces the overall number of prefix-origin
pairs from some 7.4M to 2.5M, it only represents ≈ 0.1% of all BGP
collectors’ peers routing table data during the time of the study.
4.2 Aggregating Snapshots to Timelines
Our methodology to go from individual snapshot files to a suit-
able data representation for longitudinal analysis of prefix-origin
characteristics consists of 3 steps:
(i) Normalizing visibility: To deal with absolute changes in peer
count when evaluating prefix-origin visibility, we normalize the
raw prefix-origin peer count from each snapshot by dividing the
absolute visibility of a prefix-origin pair by the maximum peer
count seen in each snapshot for the respective protocol (IPv4 or
IPv6). Our normalized visibility thus is in the (0, 1] interval for each
prefix-origin pair.
(ii) Building prefix-origin timelines: We next create timelines
for each prefix-origin aggregating the 5-minutes-apart snapshot
files, requiring (i) constant existence of the prefix-origin pair in
consecutive snapshot files,3 and (ii) a steady level of visibility of
the prefix-origin pair. We find that prefix-origin visibility is overall
3Since some snapshot files are not considered due to low BGP peer availability (see
§ 4.1), consecutive files can be more than 5 minutes apart.

relatively stable, but we want to capture significant changes. For
each prefix-origin timeline, we require that the visibility range
(maximum visibility minus minimum visibility) of the prefix-origin
pair in all contained snapshots does not exceed 0.1, that is 10%.4
(iii) Classifying prefix-origin pairs by visibility level: We next
tag each prefix-origin pair with its aggregated visibility, i.e., the me-
dian visibility of all contained timelines, weighted by their duration.
Figure 2b shows a histogram of the visibility for all prefix-origin
pairs. Here, we observe a bi-modal behavior: for IPv4, 65.3% of
prefix-origin pairs show visibility greater than 0.75, while 26.1%
show visibility lower than 0.25 (55.9% and 32.6% for IPv6 respec-
tively). To better understand the relationship of prefix-origin visibil-
ity and the total time they are originated by an AS, we leverage this
bi-modal behavior of visibility and classify prefix-origins according
to 3 levels of visibility as follows:
• Low visibility: prefix-origin pairs with an averaged median
visibility of less than 15% of active peers.
• Medium visibility: prefix-origin pairs with an averaged me-
dian visibility of less than 75% but more than 15% of active
peers.
• High visibility: prefix-origin pairs with an averaged median
visibility of 75% of active peers.
Figure 2c shows the total time that prefix-origin pairs are visible
in the global routing table for high, mid and low visibility, for IPv4
and IPv6. We note that, generally, high visibility prefix-origins are
present in the global routing table for longer time periods when
compared to medium visibility prefix-origins, and low visibility
prefix-origins. Note that in Figure 2c, the maximum duration is
naturally constrained by our measurement window of 5 years.
In the next section, we leverage our generated prefix-origin
timelines from step (ii) and the visibility and total advertisement
distribution from step (iii) to compute features at the prefix-origin
4We note that for a single snapshot file, visibility of prefix-origins is strictly bi-modal,
i.e., visibility is either close to 1 or close to 0. Our threshold of 0.1 thus works well to
capture significant changes.
and AS level to scrutinize the prefix origination behavior of serial
hijackers in the global routing table.
5 DOMINANT ORIGIN AS
CHARACTERISTICS
Since little is known about BGP behavior of serial hijacker ASes
other than the anecdotal evidence that these networks are repeat-
edly involved in BGP hijacks, we start with a mental exercise of
describing how origination behavior of a network dedicated to ma-
licious activity might look like in our BGP data. We identify five
main characteristics:
• Intermittent AS presence: BGP activity of hijackers might
be intermittent. We expect some serial hijackers to have offline
periods, during which they do not originate any prefix and are
thus not present in the global routing table.
• Volatile prefix origination behavior: We expect hijackers
to show higher variability in terms of the number of originated
prefixes over time than legitimate ASes. Further, we expect se-
rial hijackers to change prefixes more frequently, resulting in a
higher number of unique prefixes originated by serial hijackers
when compared to the average number of originated prefixes.
• Short prefix origination duration: We expect that serial hi-
jackers originate prefixes for shorter time periods than legiti-
mate ASes. However, we also expect to see short-term origina-
tion of prefixes from legitimate ASes due to misconfigurations
(cf. Figure 1a). We expect that different visibility levels of such
events might help to disambiguate hijacks from misconfigura-
tion events.
• Fragmentation of originated address space: We expect that
serial hijackers originate prefixes allocated to different RIRs
(Regional Internet Registries), whereas most legitimate ASes
originate prefixes allocated to a single RIR, reflecting geographic
boundaries of ASes. Further, we expect that some serial hijack-
ers originate unassigned address space.
IMC ’19, October 21–23, 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands
Testart et al.
• Multi-Origin conflicts (MOAS) of originated prefixes: Since
hijackers originate address space routed by other ASes, we ex-
pect to see a significantly higher share of MOAS conflicts for
prefixes originated by hijackers, when compared to legitimate
ASes. We note, however, that there are also benign cases of
MOAS conflicts that are not indicative of hijacks. We take the
behavioral characteristics, i.e., duration and frequency, of MOAS
conflicts into account to disambiguate such cases.
In the remainder of this section, we elaborate and test each
of these assumptions, introduce metrics that can capture these
behavioral patterns, and contrast the behavior of our ground truth
serial hijackers against our manually selected 35 legitimate ASes (cf.
§ 3.1). We test the relevance of our metrics using the broader set of
ground truth ASes in § 6 using a machine-learning classification
algorithm. The features used to train the algorithm are based on
the properties described in this section.5
5.1 Inconsistency and Volatility of AS Activity
To exemplify differences in AS activity, Figures 3a and 3b show
the number of originated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes over time for a
legitimate AS (AS7922, top), and a serial hijacker AS (AS133955,
bottom). Here, we see a strong contrast: while the legitimate AS is
present in the global routing table 100% of the time, we see that the
serial hijacker AS showed activity in 2015, no activity in 2016, and
then again higher levels of activity starting in mid-2017. Although
the number of prefixes originated by both ASes varies over time,
the legitimate AS shows an overall much more stable origination
pattern. We note, however, that also legitimate ASes can show high
levels of short-term variability, as evidenced in Figure 3a. This peak
is the result of AS7922 de-aggregating large prefixes for localized
traffic engineering purposes to handle an infrastructure problem in
2015.6
Intermittency of AS presence: To investigate the length and fre-
quency of AS offline periods, we compute two metrics: the number
of times an AS stops originating prefixes (offline drop count), and
the percentage of time an AS originates prefixes during its entire
lifetime (active time), where the active time is the range between
the first and the last visible prefix origination of an AS. Figure 4a
shows the distribution of these two metrics for legitimate and hi-
jacker ASes. We find that all legitimate ASes cluster in the lower
right corner, i.e., once they start originating prefixes they are almost
always seen originating prefixes, being active close to 100% of the
time. In contrast, a large share of the serial hijacker ASes have
lower overall activity times and we see multiple offline drops, i.e.,
instances where an AS ceased to originate any prefix.
We also compute these metric for ASes originating IPv6 and
obtain similar results (not shown). However, we find a few legiti-
mate ASes that show a low activity-time percentage and high count
of offline drops. Possible explanations include the fact that some
networks may have originated IPv6 prefixes for testing purposes
(recall that we cover a period of 5 years) before starting to steadily
announce IPv6 prefixes and thus have experienced offline periods
in IPv6.

Figure 3: Example of changes in prefix origination over time.
Volatility in the number of originated prefixes: To quantify
volatility in the number of originated prefixes over time (e.g., as
shown in Figure 3b), we partition our dataset into different time
bins: one day, one week and one month. Then, for each AS and bin
we compute statistics over the number of originated prefixes: range,
median, and the absolute number of prefix changes. We normalize
both the range and the number of prefix changes by the median
number of advertised prefixes. This is to allow for more variability
for large ASes, as compared to small ones. Figure 4b shows the dis-
tribution of the normalized range of originated prefixes for monthly
bins for a legitimate AS (AS174) and a serial hijacker (AS57129). In
a legitimate AS (AS174 in Figure 4b), we see that their normalized
range is small for most time bins, since the number of prefixes
originated during a typical month does not vary much. AS57129, a
serial hijacker, on the other hand, shows a higher number of bins
with higher normalized ranges.
