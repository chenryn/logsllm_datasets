### 4.3 Illustrative Examples

We will now illustrate, through three real-world scenarios, how Akamai’s content delivery service performs in various operational contexts. Specifically, we will examine the performance (e.g., Round-Trip Time (RTT), throughput) of content as it traverses Akamai’s edge infrastructure in different regions around the world. This includes the path from the EUF (Edge User Facing) delivery server, which Akamai’s mapping system identifies as the best suited to serve a given content, to the end-user client that requested that content.

#### 4.3.1 Serving a Large ISP in a Single Country

Consider a large eyeball ISP in a European country. Both the country’s population and Akamai’s deployments are concentrated in one major metropolitan area and a few medium-sized cities. Akamai’s deployments serve more than 1 Tbps at peak on a normal day to this ISP, with the vast majority of requests from the ISP’s end users being served from Akamai’s deployments within the country, specifically from Type 1 deployments and the PNI (Private Network Interconnect) links of Type 4 deployments. A very small fraction is served from Akamai’s transit links (Type 2/Type 3/Type 4 deployments), and an even smaller portion from Type 3 deployments, despite the presence of a large IXP (Internet Exchange Point) in the metropolitan area where the ISP is located.

In terms of performance, analyzing the requests originating from clients on this ISP’s network, we find that Akamai serves more than 99% of all requests from deployments that are either zero (i.e., Type 1 deployments) or one AS-hop away. The median RTT values for all four link types are around 25 ms. However, as shown in Figure 6, when examining throughput stratified into "less than 5 Mbps," "between 5-20 Mbps," and "more than 20 Mbps," and comparing off-peak and peak hours, we observe a decrease in performance for all four link types during peak hours. IXP links show the biggest performance hit, primarily due to increased congestion during peak hours. It is worth noting that in this scenario, Akamai’s mapping system directs only a negligible number of request-generating clients to Type 3 deployments.

#### 4.3.2 Serving a Country with Multiple ISPs

This scenario involves a different country where the five largest ISPs combined serve more than 80% of the country’s end users. In this case, both the end-user population and Akamai’s deployments are more uniformly distributed across the country. The country has a large IXP and several smaller, geographically dispersed IXPs, and Akamai has deployments at all of them. However, the five major ISPs have limited presence at these IXPs and severely restrict their use of public peering. Overall, Akamai’s deployments serve more than 4 Tbps at peak on a typical day to these five ISPs. We use this scenario to illustrate the similarities between the results of our analysis of the 2017-09-17 and 2018-05-17 snapshots of ViewA and their corresponding log datasets.

Figure 7a shows the performance in terms of RTT by link type for the two different snapshots. The plots use the width of the boxes to encode the traffic volume served by Akamai, with gray and black boxplots corresponding to the 2017-09-17 and 2018-05-17 snapshots of ViewA, respectively. As expected, the IXP option is rarely used, and both the large providers and Akamai prefer onnet (direct connections) and PNI over transit. This preference is driven by the need to avoid transit costs and exert better control over the large volume of traffic. Onnet connections also provide the best performance since they bring Akamai closest to the end users.

Figure 7b differentiates the same plot by ISPs. To understand the differences in performance among these large providers, we note that while all five ISPs operate fixed-line networks, ISPs A, C, and E also operate cellular networks, which generally experience higher RTTs for mobile users. Another factor explaining the performance differences (both in terms of RTT and throughput, as shown in Figure 7c) is the different arrangements Akamai has with these ISPs. In summary, different providers serving end users in the same country make their own decisions about the available link and deployment options, and these decisions significantly impact performance.
