Is This Victory?
● Everyone's mother has an illegal copy of an 
mp3 somewhere.
● Cryptography is everywhere.
● There are actual darknets which should make 
the eradication of information impossible.

Trends Have Changed
● Technology alters society.
● Information accumulates in distinct places as a

What's up with Google?
● They have an awful lot of data.
● They record everything. Your IP address, the cookie they 
issue, your search requests, the contents of every email 
you've sent or received, the news you read, the places you go, 
even your TCP headers. They're even collecting realtime GPS 
location and DNS lookups.
● The know who your friends are, where you live, where you 
work, and where you spend your free time. They know about 
your health, your love life, and your political leanings.
● They know not just what you're doing, but also a lot about 
what you're thinking.

Control the terms
● “We anonymize your data after nine months.”
● “Anonymize” means drop the last octet of an IP
