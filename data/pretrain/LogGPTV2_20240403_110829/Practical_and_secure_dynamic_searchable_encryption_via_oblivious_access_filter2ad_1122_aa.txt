## Abstract
Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) allows a client to perform keyword searches over encrypted files using an encrypted data structure. Despite its advantages, DSSE can leak search and update patterns, which can lead to severe privacy issues, as demonstrated by recent statistical attacks. While Oblivious Random Access Memory (ORAM) can hide such access patterns, it incurs significant communication overhead, making it impractical for cloud computing systems. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop private access schemes that can seal the leakages of DSSE while maintaining practical search and update operations.

In this paper, we propose a new oblivious access scheme for searchable encryption, called Distributed Oblivious Data Structure for DSSE (DOD-DSSE). The main idea is to distribute an encrypted incidence matrix across two non-colluding servers, ensuring that no arbitrary queries on these servers can be linked. This strategy not only prevents recent statistical attacks but also mitigates other potential threats that exploit query linkability. Our security analysis demonstrates that DOD-DSSE ensures the unlinkability of queries, offering higher security than traditional DSSE. Additionally, our performance evaluation shows that DOD-DSSE is significantly faster than ORAM-based techniques, with a search or update operation on a large dataset taking approximately one second, compared to 3 to 13 minutes for Path ORAM-based methods.

## 1. Introduction

Storage-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a common cloud service that allows clients to store data online, providing accessibility and reducing data management costs. However, SaaS introduces serious privacy concerns, as outsourced data can be compromised by the cloud provider or external attackers. While standard encryption protects the content of outsourced data, it hinders the data owner's ability to search and retrieve information, thereby reducing the usability of cloud services. To address this, Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) has been proposed, enabling clients to perform search and update operations on encrypted data.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Several DSSE schemes have been developed, offering various trade-offs between performance and privacy. A common drawback of these schemes is that they leak information during search and update operations. Specifically:
- Accessing encrypted files leaks file-access patterns.
- Accessing the encrypted data structure (I) leaks data structure-access patterns, including:
  - Search patterns, revealing if a search query has been repeated.
  - Update patterns, revealing statistical relationships among keywords and files.

These leakages can expose highly sensitive information, violating the privacy requirements of applications such as healthcare and military. Hiding both file-access and data structure-access patterns is essential for secure DSSE. While ORAM can hide access patterns, it is highly expensive in terms of storage and communication overhead. To reduce these costs, it is recommended to separate encrypted files and the encrypted data structure I and apply different access pattern hiding techniques to each. For example, Naveed et al. [16] used Path ORAM and Oblivious Data Structure (ODS) to access encrypted files and encrypted data structures, respectively. However, ODS is impractical for large data structures due to high communication overhead and delay.

This leads to the following research problem:
"Can we propose a protocol to obliviously access the encrypted data structure I in DSSE, which is much more efficient than ORAM, and yet seals the leakages of traditional DSSE with only minimal leakage?"

### 1.2 Our Contributions

In this paper, we introduce Distributed Oblivious Data Structure for DSSE (DOD-DSSE), a new oblivious access scheme that leverages two non-colluding servers and the properties of an incidence matrix to seal information leakages while incurring only a small-constant overhead. DOD-DSSE achieves the following:
- **Higher Security**: DOD-DSSE seals leakages from search and update operations, offering higher security than traditional DSSE schemes. It breaks the linkability between access operations on the encrypted data structure I, hiding search and update patterns, and is secure against statistical attacks.
- **Higher Efficiency**: DOD-DSSE offers significantly lower bandwidth overhead and delay compared to ORAM-based techniques. Our experimental results show that a search or update operation on a large dataset takes approximately one second with DOD-DSSE, compared to 3 to 13 minutes with Path ORAM-based methods.
