User: I have two binary files that are related one to another (meaning, when one file's records are updated, the other file's matching records should be updated as well). both files are binary files stored on disk.
The updation will look something like this:
UpdateFirstFile() -- first file is updated.....
UpdateSecondFile() -- second file is updated... 
what methods should I use to make sure that either BOTH files are updated or NONE of the files is updated?
Both files are flat files (of size 20[MB] each). I know a database would have solved this problem, yet I am note using one due to overhead reasons (every table would require much more than 20[MB] to be stored, and I am short on space and have 1000s of such files...).
Any ideas?
Assistant: Do what the RDBMS engines do.
Write an "update sequence number" in each file.
You cannot ever guarantee that both files are written.
However, you can compare the update sequence numbers to see if the files have the same sequence number. 
If the sequence numbers disagree, it's logically equivalent to no file having been written.  Delete the files and use the backup copies.
If the sequence numbers gree, it's logically equivalent to both having been written.
