When working with a Bayesian classifier for categorical data, it's common to encounter observations in the test data that were not present in the training data. This situation often arises in real-world applications and can pose challenges for the model. It is surprising that this issue has not been addressed in your current setup, as it is a frequent occurrence and requires careful handling to ensure the classifier performs well.
