Question: "Imagine you are evaluating the security design of a new proprietary communication protocol for a company. The design team suggests using a unique encryption algorithm that has never been published or subjected to peer review. They argue that keeping the algorithm secret will prevent attackers from understanding and defeating the protection mechanism. Based on your knowledge of security best practices and vulnerabilities, which of the following are valid criticisms of this approach?"
 "A": "Relying on the secrecy of the algorithm creates a risk that, if the algorithm is reverse-engineered, the entire protection mechanism could be compromised."
 "B": "Publicly-vetted algorithms are more susceptible to being defeated by attackers because they are well-known and widely understood."
 "C": "The use of a secret algorithm ensures a high level of security because attackers cannot exploit what they do not know."
 "D": "If the protection mechanism's strength significantly depends on the secrecy of its key data or algorithms, it is vulnerable to reverse engineering and other black-box analysis techniques."
