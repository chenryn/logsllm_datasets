User: I was trying to download a Python wrapper called rawpy on my Windows machine. I used the command "pip install rawpy". I have already looked at many other SO threads but could find no solution. The exact error is :

IO Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
  'external/LibRawcmake/CMakeLists.txt'

The only dependency for the wrapper is numpy, which I successfully installed. I would like to know how to fix this. Quite new to Python, so any information would help.
Assistant: User letmaik was able to help me with this. It turned out that the error was caused by my version of pip being too old. The command "python -m pip install -U pip" did not work to upgrade pip; "easy_install -U pip" was required. This allowed rawpy to be installed successfully.
