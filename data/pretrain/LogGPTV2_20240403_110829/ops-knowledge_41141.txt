I was attempting to install a Python wrapper called `rawpy` on my Windows machine using the command `pip install rawpy`. Despite reviewing multiple Stack Overflow (SO) threads, I could not find a solution to the issue. The specific error message I encountered is:

```
IO Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'external/LibRawcmake/CMakeLists.txt'
```

The only dependency for the `rawpy` wrapper is `numpy`, which I have already installed successfully. I am relatively new to Python and would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue.

**Resolution:**

With the help of user letmaik, I discovered that the problem was due to an outdated version of `pip`. Initially, I tried to upgrade `pip` using the command `python -m pip install -U pip`, but it did not work. Instead, I needed to use the command `easy_install -U pip` to update `pip`. After upgrading `pip`, I was able to install `rawpy` successfully.
