Abstract
Web users are shown an invalid certiﬁcate warning
when their browser cannot validate the identity of
the websites they are visiting. While these warn-
ings often appear in benign situations, they can also
signal a man-in-the-middle attack. We conducted a
survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their
reactions to and understanding of current SSL warn-
ings. We then designed two new warnings using warn-
ings science principles and lessons learned from the
survey. We evaluated warnings used in three pop-
ular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100-
participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our
warnings performed signiﬁcantly better than exist-
ing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited
dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our re-
sults suggest that, while warnings can be improved,
a better approach may be to minimize the use of SSL
warnings altogether by blocking users from making
unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in be-
nign situations.

Introduction
Browsers display Secure Socket Layer (SSL)1 warn-
ings to warn users about a variety of certiﬁcate prob-
lems, for example when the server’s certiﬁcate has
expired, mismatches the address of the server, or is
1The Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Secu-
rity (TLS) protocols secure web communication by encrypting
data sent between browser and server and by validating the
identity of the server. For the remainder of the paper we will
use the common convention of using the term “SSL” to refer
to both protocols.
signed by an unrecognized authority. These warn-
ing messages sometimes indicate a man-in-the-middle
or DNS spooﬁng attack. However, much more fre-
quently users are actually connecting to a legitimate
website with an erroneous or self-signed certiﬁcate.
The warnings science literature suggests that warn-
ings should be used only as a last resort when it
is not possible to eliminate or guard against a haz-
ard. When warnings are used, it is important that
they communicate clearly about the risk and provide
straightforward instructions for avoiding the haz-
ard [19, 22].
In this paper we examine user reac-
tions to ﬁve diﬀerent SSL warnings embodying three
strategies: make it diﬃcult for users to override the
warning, clearly explain the potential danger facing
users, and ask a question users can answer. By mak-
ing it diﬃcult for users to override the warning and
proceed to a potentially dangerous website, the warn-
ing may eﬀectively act as a guard against the haz-
ard, similarly to the way a fence protects people from
falling into a hole. While some people may still climb
the fence, this requires extra eﬀort. By clearly ex-
plaining the potential danger, warnings communicate
about risk. Finally, by asking users a question they
can answer, the system can tailor a warning to the
user’s situation and instruct users in the appropriate
steps necessary to avoid any hazard.
We conducted a survey of 409 Internet users’ re-
actions to current web browser SSL warnings and
found that risk perceptions were the leading factor
in respondents’ decisions of whether or not to visit a
website with an SSL error. However, those who un-
derstood the risks also perceived some common SSL
warnings as not very risky, and were more likely to
override those warnings.

We followed up this survey with a between-subjects
laboratory experiment involving 100 participants
who encountered SSL warnings on an online bank-
ing website that requested their credentials and a li-
brary website that did not request any credentials.
We tested the Firefox 2 (FF2), Firefox 3 (FF3), and
Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 (IE7) SSL warnings.
We also tested two new warnings designed to take
advantage of the lessons we learned in the survey.
The ﬁrst warning was designed with risk in mind:
it succinctly explained the risks and consequences of
proceeding to the website. The second warning was
context sensitive: it appeared to be more severe when
the participants visited websites that required them
to enter personal data. We found that most partic-
ipants ignored the FF2 and IE7 warnings on both
websites. Many participants who used FF3 were un-
able to override that warning and were thus prevented
from visiting both websites. Finally, we found that
participants who viewed our redesigned warnings bet-
ter understood the risks and made their decisions
based on the type of website they were visiting. How-
ever, despite the fact that the warnings we examined
embodied the best techniques available, none of the
warnings provided adequate protection against man-
in-the-middle attacks. Our results suggest that, while
warnings can be improved, a better approach may be
to minimize the use of SSL warnings altogether by
blocking users from making unsafe connections and
eliminating warnings in benign situations.
In the next section we provide an overview of other
studies that have been conducted on web browser se-
curity indicators. In Section 3 we present our online
SSL warning survey methodology and results. In Sec-
tion 4 we present our laboratory experiment method-
ology and results. Finally, we discuss our ﬁndings and
conclusions.
2 Background
and Related
Work
Much previous research has indicated that users do
not understand SSL. A study in 2002 found that half
of the participants could not identify a secure browser
connection [8]. A 2005 study tracked eye movements
and found that participants paid no attention to web
browser security cues such as SSL icons. Only after
priming participants to be on the lookout for secu-
rity information, 69% of participants noticed the lock
icon [21]. Schechter et al. tested the usability of se-
curity indicators by removing SSL indicators from a
banking website and observed that all 63 participants
still provided their passwords [17].
The major web browsers now include support for
extended validation (EV) certiﬁcates. A regular
certiﬁcate only tells a user that the certiﬁcate was
granted by a particular issuing authority, whereas an
EV certiﬁcate also says that it belongs to a legally
recognized corporate entity [2]. FF3 and IE7 indi-
cate a website has an EV certiﬁcate by coloring the
address bar green and displaying the name of the
website owner. However, a study by Jackson et al.
found that EV certiﬁcates did not make users less
likely to fall for phishing attacks. Many users were
confused when the chrome of the web browser was
spoofed within the content window to depict a green
address bar. Additionally, after reading a help ﬁle,
users were less suspicious of fraudulent websites that
did not yield warning indicators [11]. Sobey et al.
performed an eye tracking study in 2008 to examine
whether participants would notice simulated versions
of the EV certiﬁcate indicators that are used by FF3.
They found that none of their 28 participants exam-
ined the address bar when making online shopping
decisions, and therefore none of them encountered the
secondary SSL dialogs containing information about
the website owners [18].
Usability problems with security indicators in web
browsers go beyond SSL. Wu et al.
conducted a
study of security toolbars used to help users identify
phishing websites. The researchers examined three
diﬀerent styles of passive indicators—indicators that
do not force user interactions—that appeared in the
browser chrome. They discovered that 25% of the
participants failed to notice the security indicators
because they were focused on the primary task. In
fact, many of those who did notice the indicators did
not trust them because they believed the tool was in
error since the website looked trustworthy [23]. The
factors that go into website trust have been exten-
sively studied by Fogg et al., who found that the
“look and feel” of a website is often most important
for gaining user trust [7]. Thus users might trust
a professional looking website despite the presence
of a passive security indicator. Dhamija et al. cor-
roborated these ﬁndings by performing a study on
why people fall for phishing websites. In their study,
users examined a set of websites and were asked to
identify which ones were phishing websites. They
found that 23% of their study participants did not
look at any of the web browser security indicators
when making their decisions, even though the par-
ticipants were primed for security. The researchers
concluded that passive security indicators are inef-
fective because they often go unnoticed [4].
Wendlandt et al.
created the Perspectives sys-
tem to prevent habituation by only displaying warn-
ings when an attack is probable. Perspectives trans-
forms the CA model into a “trust-on-ﬁrst-use” model,
similar to how SSH works. “Notaries” keep track
Because of the problems with passive security in-
dicators, many web browsers now display “active”
warnings that require the user to take an action—
usually deciding whether or not to visit the destina-
tion website—in order to dismiss the warning. While
these warnings force the user to acknowledge them,
they still allow the user to ignore their advice and
proceed to the website despite the security error. In
2008, Egelman et al. performed a study on active web
browser warnings used to warn users about potential
phishing websites. They discovered that users who
claimed to have seen the warnings before were signif-
icantly more likely to ignore them in the laboratory.
They concluded that many of the participants had
become habituated to seeing similar-looking warn-
ings when browsing legitimate websites, and are now
likely to ignore all future similarly-designed warnings,
regardless of the danger they represent [6].
Jackson and Barth address the problem of users
ignoring SSL warnings with the ForceHTTPS sys-
tem [10]. Websites with CA signed certiﬁcates de-
ploy a special ForceHTTPs cookie to a user’s browser,
which from then on only accepts valid SSL connec-
tions to the website. This strategy is elegantly simple,
but it does not protect users when they encounter a
website for the ﬁrst time.
of all previously viewed SSL certiﬁcates and only
warn users when they encounter a certiﬁcate that has
changed over time. This eliminates many common
SSL errors, thereby only displaying warnings when
an attack is probable [20]. However, when users do
encounter certiﬁcates that have been altered, it is un-
clear how the warnings should be designed so as to
maximize their eﬀectiveness.
Xia and Brustoloni implement a system to help
users better react to unveriﬁed certiﬁcates [24]. The
system requires websites interested in using private
CA signed certiﬁcates to distribute tokens to their
users by physical media. In 2007, Brustoloni and Vil-
lamar´ın-Salom´on explored the idea of creating poly-
morphic dialogs to combat habituation. While their
preliminary results were promising for warning users
about malicious email attachments, it is unclear what
the long-term eﬃcacy would be if such a system were
created for SSL warnings [1].
The pervasive nature of SSL errors raises ques-
tions about the eﬃcacy of SSL warnings. A survey
of 297,574 SSL-enabled websites queried in January
2007 found 62% of the websites had certiﬁcates that
would trigger browser warnings [5]. A January 2009
study performed using a list of the top one million
websites found that at least 44% of the 382,860 SSL-
enabled websites had certiﬁcates that would trigger
warnings [13].2 Given this large sample, many of
the errors may appear on websites that are not fre-
quently visited. Our own analysis of the top 1,000
SSL-enabled websites yielded 194 SSL errors, which
is still an alarming number. Unfortunately, we do
not have data on the proportion of certiﬁcate errors
that appear on legitimate websites versus malicious
websites, making it unclear whether these particular
errors are indicative of an ongoing attack. However,
we believe it is likely that most certiﬁcate errors oc-
cur on non-malicious websites, and therefore many
users view the associated warnings as false positives.
This means that if a web browser displays a particular
warning each time it encounters any type of certiﬁ-
cate error, users will quickly become habituated to
this warning regardless of the underlying error.
2This estimate is likely low as the 2009 study did not catalog
domain name mismatch errors.
3 SSL Survey
In the summer of 2008 we conducted an online sur-
vey of Internet users from around the world to de-
termine how they perceived the current web browser
SSL warnings.
3.1 Methodology
We presented survey respondents with screenshots of
three diﬀerent SSL warnings from the browser that
they were using at the time they took the survey3
and asked them several questions about each warn-
ing. These questions were followed by a series of ques-
tions to determine demographic information.
We showed participants warnings for expired cer-
tiﬁcates, certiﬁcates with an unknown issuer, and
certiﬁcates with mismatched domain names.4 Each
warning was shown on a separate page along with
its associated questions, and the order of the three
pages was randomized. We included a between-group
condition to see if context played a role in users’ re-
sponses: half the participants were shown a location
bar for craigslist.org—an anonymous forum unlikely
to collect personal information—and the other half
were shown a location bar for amazon.com—a large
online retailer likely to collect personal and ﬁnan-
cial information. We hypothesized that respondents
might be more apprehensive about ignoring the warn-
ing on a website that was likely to collect personal
information. Below each warning screenshot, partic-
ipants were asked a series of questions to determine
whether they understood what the warnings mean,
what they would do when confronted with each warn-
ing, and their beliefs about the consequences of ignor-
ing these warnings.
We were also interested in determining how com-
puter security experts would respond to our survey,
and if the experts’ answers would diﬀer from ev-
eryone else’s answers.
In order to qualify respon-
dents as experts, we asked them a series of ﬁve ques-
3We used screenshots of the warnings from FF2, FF3, and
IE7. Users of web browsers other than FF2, FF3, or IE7 were
only asked the demographic questions.
4We examined these three warnings in particular because
we believed them to be the most common.
tions to determine whether they had a degree in an
IT-related ﬁeld, computer security job experience or
course work, knowledge of a programming language,
and whether they had attended a computer security
conference in the past two years.
We recruited participants from Craigslist and sev-
eral contest-related bulletin boards, oﬀering a gift
certiﬁcate drawing as an incentive to complete the
survey. We received 615 responses; however we used
data from only the 409 respondents who were using
one of the three web browsers under study.
3.2 Analysis
Our 409 survey respondents used the following
browsers: 96 (23%) used FF2, 117 (29%) used FF3,
and 196 (48%) used IE7. While age and gender
were not signiﬁcant predictors of responses,5 it should
be noted that 66% of our respondents were female,
signiﬁcantly more males used FF3 (χ2
2 = 34.01,
p < 0.0005), and that IE7 users were signiﬁcantly
older (F2,405 = 19.694, p < 0.0005). For these rea-
sons and because respondents self-selected their web
browsers, we analyzed the responses for each of the
web browsers separately.
