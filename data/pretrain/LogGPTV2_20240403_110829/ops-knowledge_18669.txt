User: I'm trying to follow Zed Shaw's guide for Learning Python the Hard Way.  I need to use python in Powershell.  I have Python 2.7.3 installed in C:\Python27.  Whenever I type python into Powershell, I get an error that says the term 'python' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.  I also typed in this: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")
That was a suggested solution provided, but typing python into Powershell still does nothing.  I can type in "start python" and it opens up a window with python but I need it in Powershell.  Thanks.
Assistant: The Directory is not set correctly so Please follow these steps.

"MyComputer">Right Click>Properties>"System Properties">"Advanced" tab
"Environment Variables">"Path">"Edit"
In the "Variable value" box, Make sure you see following:
;c:\python27\;c:\python27\scripts
Click "OK", Test this change by restarting your windows powershell. Type 
python
Now python version 2 runs!  yay!
