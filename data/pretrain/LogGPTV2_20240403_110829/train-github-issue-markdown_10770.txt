Subject: Issue with Image Display Using Glide

Dear Support Team,

I am new to using the Glide library and started utilizing it today, primarily due to its support for GIFs. However, I have encountered an issue where some images are not being displayed in my list, despite receiving a 200 HTTP status code as observed through Fiddler. Interestingly, these same images display correctly when using Picasso.

Could you please provide any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this problem? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Below is the relevant code snippet from my adapter where I am using Glide:

```java
Glide.with(Application.getInstance())
     .load(url)
     .into(threeImagesHolder.image0);
```

Additionally, here is a screenshot illustrating the issue:

Thank you very much for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
