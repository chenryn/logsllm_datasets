## Abstract
Botnets dominate today's attack landscape. In this work, we investigate methods to analyze collections of malicious probing traffic to understand the significance of large-scale "botnet probes." During such events, a coordinated group of remote hosts probes the address space monitored by a sensor. Our goal is to develop methodologies that allow sites receiving such probes to infer, using purely local observations, information about the probing activity, such as the scanning strategies employed and whether the site is specifically targeted or incidentally probed.

Our analysis leverages extensive honeynet data to explore the prevalence of different types of scanning, including trends, uniformity, coordination, and darknet avoidance. We also design schemes to extrapolate the global properties of scanning events (e.g., total population and target scope) from the limited local view of a honeynet. Cross-validation with DShield data shows that our inferences exhibit promising accuracy.

## 1. Introduction
When a site receives probes from the Internet, whether basic attempts to connect to its services, apparent attacks, or peculiar spikes in seemingly benign activity, the primary concern for the site's security staff is often not "are we being attacked?" (since the answer is almost always "yes, all the time") but rather "what is the significance of this activity?" Is the site being deliberately targeted, or is it simply receiving a small part of much broader probing activity?

For example, if a site with a /16 network receives malicious probes from a botnet, and the botnet probed only their /16, the site can conclude that the attacker may have a special interest in their enterprise. Conversely, if the botnet probed a much larger range, such as a /8, the attacker is likely not specifically targeting the enterprise.

The answers to these questions greatly influence the resources the site will allocate to respond to the activity. A site will typically be more concerned if the attacker has specifically targeted them, as this may reflect a determined and potentially more dangerous adversary. Such targeted attacks have recently grown in prominence.

Given the constant level of probing that all Internet addresses receive, how can a site assess the risk posed by a given event? In this work, we aim to contribute to the types of analysis that sites can apply to gauge such risks. We focus on analyzing fairly large-scale activity involving multiple local addresses, suitable for use by sites that deploy darknets, honeynets, or any monitored networks with unexpected access.

In contrast to previous work on botnets, which has focused on host-level observations, studies of particular captured botnet binaries, or network-level analysis of command-and-control (C&C) activity, our techniques aim to characterize facets of large-scale botnet probing events regardless of the nature of the botnet. Our analysis does not require assumptions about the internal organization and communication mechanisms employed by the botnets. We focus on characterizing botnet properties based on inferences from their probing behavior. Additionally, our approach requires only local information, rather than global information as required by collaborative efforts like DShield.

## 2. System Framework
### 2.1 Honeynet and Data Collection
Our detection sensor consists of ten contiguous /24 subnets within one of a large research institution’s /16 networks. We deployed Honeyd responders on five of the subnets and operated the other five completely "dark" (used for hit-list detection). The Honeyd configuration simulates common protocols such as HTTP, NetBIOS, SMB, WINRPC, MSSQL, MYSQL, SMTP, Telnet, and DameWare, with echo servers for all other port numbers. We evaluated our analysis techniques using 293 GB of trace data collected over two years (2006 and 2007).

### 2.2 Botnet Detection Subsystem
In this paper, we mainly focus on botnet inference. For completeness, we briefly introduce how to detect botnet events. Attack traffic can have complex session structures involving multiple application protocols. We label sessions with the service associated with the first destination port appearing in them, providing consistent labeling for connection attempts seen in darknets or other sensors. We aggregate connections into sessions using an approach similar to the first-step algorithm by Kannan et al. [14].

For less common protocols, background radiation noise is typically low, allowing us to use port numbers to separate event traffic. However, for popular protocols, noise is usually strong, requiring further differentiation.

## 3. Analysis Techniques
We develop a set of statistical approaches to assess the attributes of large-scale probing events, including checking for trends, uniformity, coordination, and specific forms of "hit-lists." We confirmed the consistency of these statistical techniques through manual inspection and visualization. Applying these tests to massive honeynet traffic reveals sophisticated botnet scan behaviors such as coordinated scans. We then use our suite of tests to frame the scanning strategies employed during different probe events, from which we can extrapolate the global properties for particular strategies.

## 4. Extrapolation Algorithms
We devise two algorithms to extrapolate the global properties of a scanning event based on a sensor’s limited local view. These algorithms are based on different underlying assumptions and exhibit varying accuracies. Both enable us to infer the global scanning scope of a probing event, the total number of bots, and the average scanning speed per bot. The global scanning scope helps site operators determine if their network is a specific target or if the botnet is scanning a large network that includes the site. The estimated total botnet size can help track trends in botnet usage, with implications for their C&C capabilities.

## 5. Evaluation
We evaluate our techniques using 24 months of Honeynet traffic (293 GB total) collected at a large research institution. Of the events classified as likely botnet activity, most reflected either uniform-random or uniform-hitlist scanning. Specifically, 66.5% of botnet events exhibited uniform random scanning, and 16.3% reflected hit-list scanning, with 85% of these being uniform. Most of these probes included attacks, with about 84% of scan events carrying malicious payloads targeting various protocol vulnerabilities.

To validate our estimates of the global properties, we compare our results with those from DShield, the Internet’s largest global alert repository. In 75% of cases, our extrapolated scope is within a factor of 1.35 of the scan scope observed in DShield data, and in all cases, it is within a factor of 1.5. This indicates that our approaches hold promise for sufficient accuracy to enable reliable inferences.

## 6. Conclusion
In this work, we developed methodologies for analyzing large-scale botnet probing events, enabling sites to infer significant information about the probing activity using purely local observations. Our techniques do not require assumptions about the internal organization of botnets and can be applied to various types of monitored networks. The results show promising accuracy and potential for practical use in enhancing situational awareness and response to botnet threats.
