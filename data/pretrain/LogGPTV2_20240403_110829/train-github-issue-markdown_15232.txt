When I attempt to execute Deno, I receive the following error message:

![Error Message](https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWs8zeuka9ZRfdDpbZLo7Smi2wKYPi95ruVyuCN52eBaR/deno.png)

The error message states:
"The version of this file is incompatible with the version of Windows you are using. Check your system information to determine whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version, and then contact the software publisher."

I have tried installing Deno using PowerShell and also by downloading it directly, but I encounter the same error message in both cases.

I am currently using Windows 7 32-bit.

Thank you for your assistance.
