### Title: Operation Clairvoyance: How APT Groups Spy on the Media Industry in Taiwan

#### Abstract:
Cyber espionage actors have shown a significant interest in the media industry, particularly in Taiwan. These actors appear to use media companies and journalists as "eyes" to monitor Taiwan's daily activities. During 2022, a period of heightened political activity in Taiwan, we observed an increasing number of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups infiltrating the media sector. This marks the first time that non-governmental entities, specifically media organizations, have become primary targets for these APT groups.

In this talk, we will focus on the targeted attacks against media companies in Taiwan, which we have named "Operation Clairvoyance." Given the intense political climate in Taiwan, such as the visit of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the 2022 Local Election, we have tracked over 20 targeted attack operations since 2020. Our analysis reveals technical links between these attacks and well-known Chinese APT groups, including APT23 (aka GouShe), APT41 (aka Winnti, Amoeba), and BlackTech (aka Huapi).

Our presentation will delve into the Tactic, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed by these APT groups. We have observed that these groups use a variety of TTPs, with some backdoors leveraging cloud services for command and control (C2) infrastructure. These cases provide valuable insights into China's strategic moves, and we believe these APT attacks are part of a broader, state-sponsored initiative. Our strategic intelligence suggests several potential scenarios that may help us understand the ultimate goals of these APT attacks. We will also discuss the potential consequences and implications once these threat actors have successfully infiltrated the media industry.

#### Key Points:
1. **Targeted Attacks on Media**: The media industry in Taiwan has become a primary target for APT groups.
2. **Operation Clairvoyance**: A series of more than 20 targeted attacks tracked since 2020.
3. **Technical Links**: Evidence linking these attacks to known Chinese APT groups.
4. **TTPs Analysis**: Detailed examination of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used.
5. **Strategic Insights**: Potential scenarios and the broader implications of these APT attacks.
6. **Cloud Services Abuse**: Use of cloud services for C2 infrastructure by some APT groups.
7. **State-Sponsored Initiative**: Belief that these attacks are part of a larger, state-sponsored effort.

This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the cyber threats facing the media industry in Taiwan and the strategic implications of these attacks.
