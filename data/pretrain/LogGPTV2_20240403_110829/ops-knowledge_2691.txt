User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Granular timestamps in Apache 2.2 Apache 2.4 introduced sub-second granularity for log timestamps, so you can do things like


LogFormat "%{%d/%b/%Y %T}t.%{msec_frac}t %{%z}t [...]


As far as I can tell, this feature is not available natively in Apache 2.2.  We're not ready to upgrade to 2.4 yet, but I'd still like to have granular timestamps.

Is there a way of getting this functionality in Apache 2.2?

Assistant: The documentation says this feature should exists in apache 2.2

%{format}t  | The time, in the form given by format, which should be in strftime(3) format. (potentially localized)


take a look at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_log_config.html.
