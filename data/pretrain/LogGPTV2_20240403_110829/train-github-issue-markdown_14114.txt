    julia> a=zeros(1,1); b = reshape(a,1); push!(b,1); b[1]=-1; a,b
    ([0.0], [-1.0, 1.0])
Expected behavior:
    julia> push!(b,1)
    ERROR: cannot resize array with shared data
Not really sure whether this is a bug or intended, but it is surprising and
weird (I would have expected reshape to lock further resizing on either both
the source and the target, or on neither).
