## Feature Request
Charset of ShardingSphere Proxy is determined by
  1. locale of environment
  2. The property `file.encoding`
### Is your feature request related to a problem?
If the charset was unset in environment, any non-ASCII characters will always
be malformed.
### Describe the feature you would like.
  * Parse Charset provides by client in protocol and store in connection scope. #13332
  * Intercept SQL like `set names utf8` or `set client_encoding to 'UTF8'` and set the charset to current channel attribute. Duplicated with #12245
