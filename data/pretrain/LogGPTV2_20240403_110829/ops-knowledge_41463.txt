User: How Kubernetes deploys containerized applications and provides the means to schedule and manage applications in a cluster.
Assistant: Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that helps users automate container deployment, scaling, and management. The following are the steps for Kubernetes to deploy containerized applications: 1. Create a Docker image, including the application and dependent components. 2. Configure the Kubernetes cluster. Set node and cluster parameters. 3. Deploy the Kubernetes service. Create a Deployment object describing how the container should be run, monitored and scaled. 4. Deploy the Kubernetes service. Use the Service object to expose ports for accessing services inside and outside the cluster. 5. Create an Ingress object. Ingress defines the routing rules for accessing services inside and outside the cluster. 6. Monitor and manage created containers through Kubernetes Dashboard, Kubectl or API requests. Kubernetes provides advanced management and scheduling of containerized applications by defining objects such as Pod, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service, Ingress, ConfigMap, and Secret. Using these objects, users can manage containers, monitor applications, extend applications, configure applications, and more. Kubernetes can automatically handle network communication between containers, ensuring high availability and load balancing of containers, as well as horizontal expansion and automatic scaling of applications.
