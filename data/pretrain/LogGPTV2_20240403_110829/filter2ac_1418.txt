**ATT&CK ID:** S0698  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** HermeticWizard

HermeticWizard has been observed using the `regsvr32.exe` command with the `/s` and `/i` switches to execute malicious payloads. Specifically, the command `regsvr32.exe /s /i` is leveraged to load and execute a malicious script or binary, often bypassing security controls that might otherwise block direct execution of the payload.

This approach allows the malware to take advantage of a legitimate Windows utility for executing its code, thereby increasing the likelihood of evading detection by security systems.
