Question: "In a 64-bit system using pointer authentication, why would an attacker not benefit from knowing the PACs to generate a valid PAC for a chosen malicious address?"
 "A": "Knowing the PACs is useless without the corresponding addresses since the PAC is address-specific and generated using a secure, deterministic function."
 "B": "The CPU stores all the PACs, making it impossible for an attacker to access or use them without having control over the CPU."
 "C": "PACs are only used for addresses stored in the CPU's cache, which are not accessible by standard memory corruption attacks."
 "D": "The PACs are encoded using a one-time pad, which makes them indistinguishable from random data and impossible to reverse-engineer."
Answer: A
