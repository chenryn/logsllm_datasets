### Figure 17: QQ Plots Comparing Attacker Empirical Distortion Distributions

**Description:**
- **Top Row:** QQ plots for Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions.
- **Bottom Row:** QQ plots for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.
- **Frame Size:** 32 bits.
- **Distances:** Varying distances compared against a standard normal distribution.

**Key Points:**
- The attack signal distortion at 100 meters (LoS) and 10 meters (NLoS) should be close to a Gaussian distribution for the results to be valid with respect to the MTAC region boundary.
- The QQ plots in the second column are close to the diagonal, indicating that the empirical distributions are well-approximated by a normal distribution.

**Quantiles:**
- **Standard Normal Quantiles:**
  - **Range:** -4 to 4
  - **Values:** 0.99, 0.98, 0.97, 0.96, 0.95, 0.2, 0.18, 0.16, 0.14, 0.12, 0.1, 0.08, 0.35, 0.3, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.5, 0.45, 0.4, 0.35, 0.3, 0.88, 0.87, 0.86, 0.85, 0.84, 0.83, 0.82

### Figure 18: QQ Plots Comparing Legitimate Empirical Distortion Distributions

**Description:**
- **Top Row:** QQ plots for Line-of-Sight (LoS) conditions.
- **Bottom Row:** QQ plots for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) conditions.
- **Frame Size:** 32 bits.
- **Distances:** Varying distances compared against a standard normal distribution.

**Key Points:**
- The attack signal distortion at 200 meters (LoS) and 20 meters (NLoS) should be close to a Gaussian distribution for the results to be valid with respect to the MTAC region boundary.
- The QQ plots in the third column are close to the diagonal, indicating that the empirical distributions are well-approximated by a normal distribution.

**Quantiles:**
- **Standard Normal Quantiles:**
  - **Range:** -4 to 4
  - **Values:** 0.88, 0.87, 0.86, 0.85, 0.84, 0.83, 0.82

### Figure 19: Attacker's Advantage vs. Bit-Equivalent MTAC Security Level

**Description:**
- **X-Axis:** Number of bits (n).
- **Y-Axis:** Logarithmic scale of the attacker's advantage.
- **Conditions:**
  - **LoS (300m):** Red line.
  - **NLoS (30m):** Blue line.

**Key Points:**
- The attacker's advantage decreases more rapidly than the bit-equivalent MTAC security level as the frame length increases.
- This implies that the security guarantees for shorter frames are maintained or even enhanced for longer frames.

**Plot Details:**
- **Y-Axis Range:** 0 to -300 on a logarithmic scale.
- **X-Axis Range:** 0 to 100 bits.

By organizing the information in this manner, the text is more structured, clear, and professional, making it easier to understand the context and key points of each figure.
