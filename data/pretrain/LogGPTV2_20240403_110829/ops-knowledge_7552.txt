User: When I run setup.py, I generally want to add different command line options to the call, based on which kind of distribution I'm building.
For example I want to add --user-access-control force if I build a windows installer (bdist_wininst).
Another example would be omitting the call to a post-install-script when building a source distribution.
My current solution would be to create small .bat and .sh scripts with the desired call to setup.py, but that feels somehow wrong.
Is there a better way to do what I want, or are my instincts failing me?
Edit: Found the correct way. See my answer below.
Assistant: Turned out the "correct" way to do it was pretty straight forward and I just missed it when looking in the documentation:
Use setup.cfg.
It's a standard config-file, where you can define a section for each build-target / kind of distribution (sdist, bdist_wheel, bdist_wininst, etc.), which contains the command line options you want to give to setup.py when building it.
