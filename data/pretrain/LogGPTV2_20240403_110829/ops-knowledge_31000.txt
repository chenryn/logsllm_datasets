User: What steps do I need to take to harden the security of my application? Please list the specific steps.
Assistant: 1. Regularly update the application code and framework. 2. Implement security audits and vulnerability scans to discover and repair application vulnerabilities in a timely manner. 3. Restrict limited access rights, using minimal privileges so administrators can control the authentication and access approval process. 4. Implement multi-layer defense mechanisms, such as using anti-virus software, implementing security disk encryption and network access control and other measures. 5. Educate employees about security issues and remind them not to fall for scams, malicious apps, email attachments, etc. 6. Implement a compensation system and establish a safety awareness training program to increase employee awareness of participation in and control of safety incidents. 7. Establish an Emergency Response Plan (ERP), including small-scale business interruptions and countermeasures against malicious acts, and maintain standing backup data, equipment, and monitoring systems. 8. Regularly conduct vulnerability testing and source code review of the code during the maintenance of the comprehensive security control process, so that it can prove internal and external trustworthiness. 9. Implement access controls and encryption to ensure application and system data is protected. 10. Implement a strong password process, mandate the use of complex passwords for access to systems, applications, and private data, and periodically require users to change passwords.
