### Observations and Analysis

The finding that only three participants believed Bob had reinstalled the app is quite surprising. This suggests that either these users ignored or did not read the informational error message, or they simply dismissed the possibility of an attack or reinstallation while remaining under a false sense of security. The different strategies for verification and mitigation indicate flawed mental models: users seem to lack a comprehensive understanding of end-to-end encryption, potential attack scenarios, and associated risks. The findings from Section IV-C1 also suggest that users place a high level of trust in the app to handle security issues in the background, assuming that the app's dialogues can be trusted.

### Recommendations for SIGNAL

To enhance the usability and security of SIGNAL, we propose the following improvements:

#### 1. **Awareness of Security Status**
   - **Current Issue:** Conversations are considered properly end-to-end encrypted only after Alice’s (the user’s) and Bob’s (the conversational partner’s) Identity Keys have been successfully verified. However, SIGNAL does not remember the verification status, and users must manually keep track of whom they have already verified.
   - **Recommendation:** Implement a mechanism to quickly assess the security status of a conversation. This status should be directly visible in the corresponding conversation, providing users with a clear indication of whether the conversation is securely encrypted.

#### 2. **Comprehensible Instructions for Recommended Actions**
   - **Current Issue:** Users, especially those without a deep understanding of asymmetric encryption, often fail to act on the displayed information during key comparison.
   - **Recommendation:** Provide clear and concise instructions for recommended actions. For example, a brief instructional message could guide users to contact their partner outside the app to compare Identity Keys. If the keys do not match, users should be directed to consult the FAQ or contact the developers. This issue is particularly pressing for the Android version of SIGNAL, as the iOS version provides some basic guidance but lacks information on how to proceed in case of a fingerprint mismatch.

#### 3. **Clear Risk Communication**
   - **Current Issue:** During the process of accepting Bob’s identity after an attack, the button labels "Verify" and "Accept" were misleading, leading users to assume that the mitigation process would lead to a verification of Bob.
   - **Recommendation:** Clearly communicate the possible consequences of users' actions. For instance, during the identity acceptance process, provide more explicit information about the risks involved and the steps to take if the verification fails.

#### 4. **Easily Accessible Verification**
   - **Current Issue:** The current verification options are not easily accessible, leading to lower rates of successful verifications.
   - **Recommendation:** Make the verification options more accessible by adding a shortcut for the verification mechanism directly within the conversation menu. This will increase visibility and encourage users to verify their partners' identities more frequently.

### Usability of Error Handling in SIGNAL

Our findings on the usability of SIGNAL’s error handling during actual attacks revealed that these features often caused more confusion than effective mitigation. Given this, it is not surprising that WHATSAPP has disabled all encryption-related error messages by default. Users who want to receive feedback on mismatching Identity Keys must explicitly enable the error messages in the preferences. Reactions to non-comprehensible error messages range from uninstalling the app to contacting the developers, often resulting in a general feeling of insecurity. We assume that the developers of WHATSAPP made a compromise between usability and security due to economic reasons. Since communication over WHATSAPP was recently encrypted between the client and the server, messages about changed Identity Keys might lead to confusion and, ultimately, user dissatisfaction and uninstallation.

### Related Work

Usable security, a relatively new field of research, focuses on developing secure systems that are usable by the people who actually use them [19]. Cranor argues that many security failures stem from unintentional mistakes by users due to usability problems [20]. Previous work on the usability of secure messaging has largely focused on PGP and S/MIME, revealing significant usability issues [1], [2], [3], [4]. These findings help explain why PGP and S/MIME have not yet achieved widespread adoption. Assal et al. [21] explored mobile privacy through a survey and usability evaluation of three privacy-preserving mobile apps, including the Off-the-Record Messaging application ChatSecure [22]. They found that many participants incorrectly assumed their conversations were encrypted, primarily due to usability issues and incomplete mental models of privacy risks. Our study builds on this work, focusing on the unique usability challenges of SIGNAL, which is encrypted by default.

Mental models, as internal representations of concepts, significantly influence cognition, reasoning, and decision-making. Although they are inherently incomplete and inaccurate, mental models provide predictive and explanatory powers for understanding interaction [23], [24], [25]. In the context of security, mental models of security mechanisms and threat scenarios play a crucial role in usable security research. Mental models mediate the processing of risk messages [26] and can be exploited by malicious software [27]. Our work extends research on the use of mental models in usable security, helping to better understand the usability issues faced by our participants.

The most comprehensive work on secure messaging is by Unger et al. [29], which provides a current view on the challenges for secure messaging and additional context for our work, particularly regarding technical means to verify users and mitigate MITM attacks. Frosch et al. [13] provide a detailed analysis of the underlying cryptographic protocol of SIGNAL, while Schrittwieser et al. [30] discuss various security issues of early mobile messengers. Rottermanner et al. [31] focus on the unique privacy challenges posed by mobile messengers. With the exception of Unger et al. [29], previous work on secure mobile messaging does not extensively discuss usability issues but rather focuses on technical aspects.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a user study on the security and usability of SIGNAL for Android, a secure mobile messenger that offers a promising solution for widely adoptable end-to-end encrypted conversations. We first discussed the unique security challenges and threats faced by today's secure mobile messengers. We then conducted a comprehensive user study on the usability of SIGNAL’s security features, simulating man-in-the-middle attacks and showing that the majority of users failed to detect and deter such attacks. Finally, we proposed several improvements to make SIGNAL’s existing security features easier to use.
