and only 3 thought that Bob reinstalled the app seem quite
surprising. Either those users ignored, or did not read, the
informational error message or simply excluded the possibility
of an attack/reinstallation while remaining under the false
illusion of security. The different strategies for veriﬁcation and
mitigation deﬁnitely hint at ﬂawed mental models: users seem
to lack an understanding of end-to-end encryption in general,
possible attack scenarios and risk potentials. The ﬁndings from
section IV-C1 also indicate a great trust by the users in the
app to deal with security issues in the background, therefore
assuming that the app’s dialogues could be trusted.
A. Recommendations for SIGNAL
We think that SIGNAL can be improved in order to provide
end-to-end encryption for the masses and further close the
gap between insufﬁcient knowledge on the users’ side and
possible support through the app. We suggest the following
usability improvements to contribute towards an enhanced
usable security experience for SIGNAL:
Awareness on security status of conversations: Conver-
sations can only be assumed to be properly end-to-end en-
crypted once Alice’s (the user’s) and Bob’s (the conversational
partner’s) Identity Keys were successfully veriﬁed. SIGNAL
does not remember the veriﬁcation status — only point-in-
time veriﬁcations are possible and the user has to remember
whom of his/her partners he/she already veriﬁed. SIGNAL thus
lacks mechanisms to quickly assess the security status of a
conversation. Such a security status should be directly visible
in the corresponding conversation.
Comprehensible instructions for recommended actions:
In order to avoid risky behavior, especially in the veriﬁca-
tion and attack mitigation process, users should be provided
with clear instructions respectively suggestions for actions.
On the key comparison page users with no exact knowledge
of asymmetric encryption mechanisms failed to act on the
5
displayed information. In our opinion, a brief instructional
message combined with optional further information would
have led to a higher veriﬁcation success rate (e.g. “Please
contact your partner outside the app to compare your Identity
Keys. If the Identity Keys do not match, please consult the FAQ
or contact the developers.”). We found that this issue is most
pressing for the Android version of SIGNAL. The iOS version
of SIGNAL provides brief information on how to verify users:
“Compare both ﬁngerprints to verify your contact’s identity
and the integrity of the message”. However, no information
is provided on how to proceed in case of failure (ﬁngerprint
mismatch).
Clear risk communication: On the other hand SIGNAL
should inform users of the possible consequences of their
actions. E.g. during the process of accepting Bob’s identity
after the attack the denomination of the buttons (”Verify” and
”Accept”) was misleading. Under the false assumption that the
mitigation process would lead to a veriﬁcation of Bob, users
failed to have a clear understanding of the risks.
Easily accessible veriﬁcation: The veriﬁcation options
should be easily accessible in the menu. A suggestion would
be to add a shortcut for the veriﬁcation mechanism directly to
the conversation in order to maximize visibility.
Based on our ﬁndings on the usability of SIGNAL’s error
handling of actual attacks, we found that these features led
to more problems than to actual attack mitigations. Under
these circumstances it is not surprising that WHATSAPP has
disabled all encryption related error messages by default. If
users want to get feedback on mismatching Identity Keys or
alike, they explicitly have to enable the error messages in
the preferences. Since reactions to non-comprehensible error
messages (due to the interplay of potential missing information
on the app’s side and incomplete mental models on the
user’s side) range from uninstalling of the app, contacting
the developers and/or a deﬁnitive feeling of insecurity in
general, we assume the developers of WHATSAPP made a
compromise between usability and security due to economical
reasons. Since communication over WHATSAPP was only
encrypted between the client and the server recently, messages
on changed Identity Key might lead to confusion, ultimately
angry users and eventually uninstallation.
VI. RELATED WORK
Usable security as relatively new ﬁeld of research focuses
on the development of secure systems including the people
who actually use them [19]. Cranor e.g. argues that security
failures often originate from unintentional mistakes by users
of computer systems due to usability problems [20]. Previous
work speciﬁcally on the usability of secure messaging focused
to a large extend on PGP and S/MIME. A number of exper-
iments showed that this ﬁrst end-to-end encrypted messaging
protocols were plagued with usability issues [1], [2], [3],
[4]. These previous results might also explain why PGP and
S/MIME have not, as yet, enjoyed widespread adoption. Assal
at al. [21] explored mobile privacy through a survey and
usability evaluation of three privacy-preserving mobile apps,
including the Off-the-Record Messaging application ChatSe-
cure [22]. They observed a high number of participants who
thought their conversations were encrypted while they were
6
not, mainly due to usability issues and incomplete mental
models of privacy risks. The study of Assal et al. has a
close relation to our work. However SIGNAL communication
is encrypted by default and we focus on the unique usability
challenges of SIGNAL.
Mental models as an internal representation of concepts
have a great inﬂuence on cognition, reasoning and decision-
making. Although being incomplete and inaccurate by nature,
mental models are able to provide predictive and explana-
tory powers for understanding interaction [23], [24], [25].
Especially with security’s complex problems and concepts,
mental models of security or privacy mechanisms and possible
threat scenarios play a major role in usable security research.
Mental models mediate the processing of risk messages [26].
One possible threat scenario in consequence is for malicious
software to take advantage of gaps in the users’ mental models
[27]. The same incomplete internal representations of concepts
and threats proved to be the reason for low end-to-end encryp-
tion uptake, apart from the lack of usability [3]. Nevertheless
mental models in usable security research can help to shed
light on users’ decisions in case of failure detection [28]. Our
work extends research on the use of mental models in the area
of usable security and proved helpful to better understand the
usability issues our participants faced.
The most comprehensive work on secure messaging has
been published by Unger at al. [29]. Their survey provides
a current view on challenges for secure messaging, and as
such provides additional context for our work especially re-
garding technical means to verify users and the mitigation
of MITM attacks. Regarding the main focus of our work,
SIGNAL, Frosch et al. [13] provide a detailed analysis of the
underlying cryptographic protocol of SIGNAL. Schrittwieser
at al. [30] discuss the different attack vectors like account
hijacking, sender ID spooﬁng, enumeration and several other
security issues of early mobile messengers. This study has been
complemented by Rottermanner et al. [31], who focused on the
unique privacy challenges posed by mobile messengers. With
the exception of the work by Unger at al. [29], previous work
on secure mobile messaging does not discuss usability issues
of secure mobile messengers but rather focuses on purely
technical issues.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented a user study on the security and
usability of SIGNAL for Android, a secure mobile messenger
that provides a promising solution for widely adoptable end-to-
end encrypted conversations. SIGNAL’s protocol has recently
been adopted by WHATSAPP, which means that over one
billion users can now potentially exchange messages protected
by strong encryption. We ﬁrst discussed the unique security
challenges and threats today’s secure mobile messengers face.
Second, we conducted a comprehensive user study on the
usability of SIGNAL’s security features. As part of our user
study we simulated man-in-the-middle attacks and showed that
the great majority of users failed to detect and deter such
attacks. We ﬁnally proposed a number of improvements for
SIGNAL to make the existing security features easier to use.
