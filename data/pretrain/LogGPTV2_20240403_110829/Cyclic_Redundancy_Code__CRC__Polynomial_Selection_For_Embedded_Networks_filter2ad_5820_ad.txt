## Notes:
- All polynomials are represented as a product of irreducible factors.
- All polynomial factors marked with (‡) are primitive.

## Data Array
Unfortunately, 0x68 is dominated by six other polynomials and is generally inferior to 0x48. Similarly, [Jaffer03] indicates that various web-based sources are evenly split between 0xC06 and 0xC07 as being the "standard" CRC-12 polynomial. Numerical Recipes states that CRC-12 is 0xC05 [Press92]. One can speculate that these are also one-bit transcription errors.

## Conclusions
New embedded networks that use CRCs are continually being created. Unfortunately, the usual practice of selecting a published CRC polynomial under the presumption that it is "good" runs into trouble because some published values perform quite poorly. Moreover, even if a good published polynomial is available, there is generally no published guidance on what range of data word lengths it is good for, nor quantitative data to help distinguish that good polynomial from any competing published or standardized "bad" polynomials.

This paper presents the first exhaustive survey of all CRC polynomials from 3 bits to 15 bits, and discusses 16-bit polynomials as well. A methodology for selecting generically "good" CRC polynomials is based on achieving maximum Hamming Distance for the longest possible data word sizes and other performance considerations. Our tables of good polynomials should enable practitioners to use quantitative information in selecting effective polynomials for embedded computing error detection applications for data word sizes up to 2048 bits.
