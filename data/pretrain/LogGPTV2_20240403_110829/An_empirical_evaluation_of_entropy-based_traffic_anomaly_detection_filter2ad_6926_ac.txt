# Synthetic Anomalies and Their Detection

## Table 5: Taxonomy of Synthetic Anomalies Used in Our Evaluation

| **Anomaly Type** | **DstPort** | **SrcPort** | **FlowSize** |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Fixed            | Fixed       | Fixed       | Fixed (10 Kbps), 1 flow per packet |
| Port Scan        | Fixed/Random | Fixed | Random (300-400 Kbps), 1 flow per host |
| Random Sequential | Random | Sequential | 1-3 packets (10% response rate) |

### Behavioral Features and Anomaly Detection

#### DDoS Flood
- **Behavioral Features**: FSD, source port, and source address are unaffected.
- **Detection**: The anomaly is detected (i.e., the score is ≥ α = 2) only when the anomaly has significantly increased in magnitude. Degree distributions remain unaffected by this anomaly.

#### Bandwidth Flood
- **Description**: A small number of hosts send large amounts of traffic to a single destination.
- **Key Differences from DDoS**: 
  - Number of hosts involved is an order of magnitude smaller.
  - Each attack flow is a single high-volume flow.
- **Traffic Characteristics**: 
  - Rate of traffic from each host varies uniformly between 300 to 400 Kilobits per second.
  - Fixed packet size of 57 bytes.
  - Target IP is chosen randomly within the university with a specific destination port (e.g., port 80 on a webserver).
- **Results**: 
  - FSD, source port, and source address are unaffected.
  - Destination ports and addresses exhibit the greatest deviation.
  - Traffic volume can detect this anomaly effectively, with a detection threshold α = 2, the total traffic increases by 25%.

#### Network Scans
- **Types of Scanning Activity**:
  - Single host scanning the entire university address space.
  - Distributed scanning activity from a set of random source addresses.
- **Real Scanning Activity Properties**:
  - Sampled 10,000 inbound scan flows to port 445.
  - Scans receive responses to probes approximately 10% of the time for a flow size of 3 packets.
- **Single Scanner**:
  - No distribution can detect a single scanner, even at a high scan rate (6% of total traffic).
  - More fine-grained per-host analysis and other aspects of scanning behavior (e.g., failed connections) are necessary for detection.
- **Coordinated Scan**:
  - Multiple hosts (e.g., part of a botnet) scan a particular network.
  - Scan rate fixed at 30 hosts per second.
  - Additional 10% of the total flows needed before the wavelet score reaches α = 2.
  - Entropy-based anomaly detection may not be sufficient even in coordinated scans.

### Implications for Anomaly Detection

1. **Choice of Features**:
   - Selection of traffic distributions should be judicious.
   - Complementary distributions that provide different views into the underlying traffic structure are more effective.
   - Behavioral distributions and FSD offer distinct and often better anomaly detection capabilities.

2. **Computing Distributions**:
   - Unidirectional traffic accounting can introduce biases.
   - Bi-directional measurements, though involving additional overhead, are preferable.
   - For enterprise networks, bi-directional semantics are easier to obtain and should be preferred.

3. **Leveraging Correlations**:
   - Stability of correlations in entropy values during normal periods suggests a new anomaly detection technique.
   - Correlations over a finite time window T can detect anomalies in the timeseries of correlation values.
   - In the CMU-2005 dataset, non-trivial anomalies significantly decrease entropy correlations between source and destination address (port) pairs.

### Conclusions

- **Findings**:
  - Port and address distributions are strongly correlated in their entropy timeseries and detection capabilities.
  - Behavioral metrics and FSD provide distinct detection abilities.
  - Port and address distributions have limited utility in detecting scanning attacks and large flood anomalies.

- **Implications**:
  - Look beyond port and address distributions for fine-grained anomaly detection.
  - Use complementary distributions for better detection.
  - Use bi-directional flow abstractions to avoid biases from unidirectional auditing.
