User: How can I find where my local development datastore is located? I am using the Python SDK and Linux.
Assistant: The default location of the datastore for the platform you're running the app engine on is provided in the README that comes with the platform (at least, in the one for Linux). The README is in google_appengine_x.x.xx/google_appengine/README. This is what is says in the Linux'es one: 

--datastore_path=DS_FILE   Path to file to use for storing Datastore file
                               stub data.
                               (Default /tmp/dev_appserver.datastore)
