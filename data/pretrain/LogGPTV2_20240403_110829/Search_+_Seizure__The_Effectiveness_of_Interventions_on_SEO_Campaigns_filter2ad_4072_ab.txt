crime ecosystem has evolved separately in East Asia with its own
standard practices and behaviors.
calized sites catering to international markets (e.g., United King-
dom, Germany, Japan, and so forth). Unlike other kinds of coun-
terfeit sales, which centralize payment processing within the afﬁli-
ate program [16, 25, 34], we ﬁnd each counterfeit luxury storefront
allocates order numbers independently and engages directly with
payment processors (merchant identiﬁers exposed directly in the
HTML source on storefront pages allowed us to conﬁrm). Finally,
in the traditional afﬁliate program model, fulﬁllment is managed
internally by the program, but in our investigations we have found
at least one fulﬁllment site for luxury goods that appears to be de-
signed to support outside sales on an á la carte basis (i.e., the site is
designed to support wholesale ordering and allows each member to
track the order status of their customer’s shipments). Overall, we
suspect the counterfeit luxury ecosystem does not use an afﬁliate
program and instead the ecosystem is composed of several inde-
pendent advertisers (SEO campaigns) contracting with third parties
for fulﬁllment and payment processing.
3.2 Interventions
As we have observed, the two groups with natural incentives
to disrupt SEO campaigns targeting counterfeit luxury goods are
search engine providers and luxury brand holders. Search engines
maintain the value of their page views (and hence the pricing they
can charge for advertising) by providing consistently high quality
search results for their users. Thus, all major search engines have
active anti-abuse teams that try to reduce the amount of search spam
appearing in their results. When an SEO campaign is detected,
search engines attempt to disrupt the campaign by either demot-
ing their doorway pages in search results or even removing those
pages from the search index entirely. Brand holders have a far less
privileged technical position and they are neither able to analyze
the Web at scale nor directly inﬂuence search results. However,
as brand and trademark holders they have unique legal powers that
allow them to target particular pieces of infrastructure from SEO
campaigns. These two techniques, search and seizure, represent the
de facto standard methods of intervention against SEO campaigns,
with pressure applied at different strata in the business model.
Search Engine
3.2.1
In addition to allowing the search ranking algorithm to demote
doorways performing black hat SEO, search engines commonly
http://anonymized!http://anonymized!361have special handling for certain classes of malicious content. For
example, starting in 2008, Google’s Safe Browsing service (GSB)
has detected and blacklisted sites leading to malware or phishing
sites with the aim of preventing users from being defrauded through
search. GSB labels search results leading to malware or phishing
pages as malicious, appends the subtitle “This site may harm your
computer” to the result, and prevents the user from visiting the site
directly by loading an interstitial page rather than the page linked
to by the result.
In 2010, Google instituted a similar effort to detect compromised
Web sites and label them as hacked by similarly appending the sub-
title “This site may be hacked” in the result [9]. The motivation is to
curb the ability of compromised sites to reach unsuspecting users,
while simultaneously creating an incentive for innocent site owners
to discover their site has been compromised and clean it. In prin-
ciple, this notiﬁcation could undermine black hat SEO since users
may be wary to click on links with a warning label.
However, there are important differences between these two seem-
ingly similar efforts, which more likely reﬂect policy decisions
rather than technical limitations. First, contrary to malicious search
results, users can still click through hacked search results without
an interstitial page. Second, typically only the root of a site is la-
beled as hacked; e.g., while http://anonymized may be labeled
as a hacked site, http://anonymized/customize.php will not.
Unfortunately, often only the non-root search results are compro-
mised and redirect users, while the root search result is clean. In
Section 5.2 we examine the implications and limitations of these
policy decisions on search interventions against SEO campaigns.
3.2.2 Seizure
As the name suggests, seizures reﬂect the use of a legal process
to obtain control of an infringing site (typically by seizing their
domain name, but occasionally by seizing control of servers them-
selves) and either shut it down or, more commonly, replace it with
a seizure notiﬁcation page.
In the context of counterfeit luxury,
seizures prevent users from visiting seized domains, thereby hin-
dering the store’s ability to monetize trafﬁc. Although we have wit-
nessed brand holders performing seizures directly, typically they
contract with third party legal counsel or with companies who spe-
cialize in brand protection, such as MarkMonitor [23], OpSec Se-
curity [28] and Safenames [31], to police their brand.
However, there are signiﬁcant asymmetries in this approach. For
example, a new domain can be purchased for a few dollars, but
the cost to serve a legal process to seize it can cost 50–100 times
more. Similarly, while a new domain name can be allocated within
a few minutes and effectively SEO’ed in 24 hours [36], a seizure
ﬁrst requires ﬁnding the site, ﬁling a legal claim and then waiting
(from days to weeks) for the docket to be picked up by the federal
judge to whom the case has been assigned. Presumably to amor-
tize these costs, a manual review of court documents shows that
domain name seizures commonly occur in bulk (hundreds or thou-
sands at a time) and are not performed on a reactive basis. Finally,
it is worth noting that doorway sites based on compromised Web
servers present their own challenges since seizing the domain of an
innocent third party can carry liability. Thus, while brands some-
times seize doorway pages, it is more common for them to target
the storefront advertised. Section 5.3 explores these asymmetries
in greater depth.

terfeit storefront sites. We then use a combination of manual label-

ing and supervised learning to map storefront sites into the different
SEO campaigns that promote them. On a subset of storefront sites,
we also use a combination of test orders and actual purchases to
reveal information about customer order volume and payment pro-
cessing. Finally, we crawl the site of a supplier to provide insight
into the scale of order fulﬁllment and high-level customer demo-
graphics. This section describes each of these efforts in detail.
4.1 Google Search Results
Our primary data set comes from daily crawls of Google search
results using a system that we previously developed for detecting
search cloaking [35]. Each day we issue queries to Google using
search terms targeted by counterfeit sites, crawl the sites listed in
the search results, and identify sites using cloaking as depicted in
Figure 1. We repeat this process for ﬁve months from November
13, 2013 through July 15, 2014.
In the rest of this section we deﬁne the notion of counterfeit
luxury verticals for organizing search queries, and describe our
methodology for selecting the search terms that comprise the ver-
ticals, the implementation of our crawlers and the information they
collect, and our heuristics for detecting counterfeit stores in poi-
soned search results.
Note that we search exclusively using Google for a couple of
reasons. In prior work we found that Google is the most heavily
targeted search engine by attackers performing search poisoning
and black hat SEO [35]. Furthermore, Google is the leading search
engine for the United States and many European countries, the pre-
eminent markets receiving counterfeit products (based on shipping
data from a large supplier as discussed in Section 4.5).
Search Terms
4.1.1
Any work measuring search results is biased towards the search
terms selected because the selected terms represent just a subset of
the entire search index. In our study, we monitor search results for
counterfeit luxury verticals, a set of search terms centered around
a single brand (e.g., Ralph Lauren) or a category composite of sev-
eral brands (e.g., Sunglasses is a composite of Oakley, Ray-Ban,
Christian Dior, etc.). For our study, each vertical consists of a static
set of 100 representative terms that we determined were targeted by
SEO campaigns.
362Due to the early prominence of the KEY campaign, a large SEO
botnet responsible for most of the PSRs manually observed in Sept-
ember 2013, we initially compiled terms for each of the 13 verti-
cals it targeted as listed in Table 1. Similarly, we followed the KEY
campaign’s approach in determining whether to center a verticals’
terms around a single brand or a composite. To select these terms
we extracted keywords from the URLs of the doorway pages of the
KEY campaign. For a given vertical, we manually queried Google
to ﬁnd ten KEY doorways redirecting to the same store selling coun-
terfeit merchandise (related to the vertical). Then we issued site
queries (e.g., “site:doorway.com”) for each doorway to collect all
search results originating from the doorway. And for each search
result we extracted search terms from the URL path (e.g., “cheap
beats by dre” from http://doorway.com/?key=cheap+beats+
by+dre) to assemble a large collection of terms. We then randomly
selected 100 unique terms as a representative set for each vertical.
To extend the scope of our study to other campaigns, we included
three additional verticals that we saw counterfeiters targeting: Ed
Hardy, Louis Vuitton, and Uggs. Since the KEY campaign does not
target these brands, we adopted a different approach in selecting
search terms by using Google Suggest, a keyword autocomplete
service. We ﬁrst fetched suggestions for a targeted brand (e.g.,
“Louis Vuitton wallet”). Then we recursively fetched suggestions
for the suggestions.
In addition, we fetched suggestions for the
concatenation of a commonly used adjective (e.g., cheap, new, on-
line, outlet, sale or store) and the brand name to form search strings
(e.g., “cheap Louis Vuitton”). From the combined set of these vari-
ous search strings, we randomly selected 100 unique strings as our
search set for each vertical.
To evaluate any bias introduced from these two different ap-
proaches, we take the ten original KEY verticals that are not com-
posites, generate alternate search terms using the Google Suggest
approach, and run the crawlers using those alternate terms for one
day on April 25, 2014. Among the ten verticals, we ﬁnd four out of
a thousand total terms overlap. Additionally, when comparing the
percentange of PSRs detected after crawling, for both classiﬁed and
unknown, and the distribution of PSRs associated to speciﬁc cam-
paigns, we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant difference between results from the
original and alternate terms over the same time range. Despite us-
