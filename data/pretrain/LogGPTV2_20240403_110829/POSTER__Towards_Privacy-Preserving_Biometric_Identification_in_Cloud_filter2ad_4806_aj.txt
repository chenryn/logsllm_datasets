determined our selection for a particular cryptographic mechanism. Our aim
was to address these shortcomings and our work pointed out that security and
privacy in biometrics should not be seen as two diﬀerent ﬁelds, hindering each
there. Internationally and in the European Union, with the proliferation of
technological changes, the legal frameworks for the protection of biometric data
are increased. However, we believe that there is need for future work in order
to evaluate whether the biometric designs serve their primary objectives and
respect the privacy policies, especially for the scenarios where impersonation
and biometric disclosure are crucial.
An important part of this thesis focused on the techniques to enhance the
secrecy and privacy of biometric data for their implementation in ePassports
and identity cards. We presented a concrete analysis of cryptographic schemes
and evaluated how these could limit the security gaps. In collaboration with
colleagues from FIDELITY Project [67], we concluded that although research
in pattern recognition and biometric protection areas matures, the existing
approaches suﬀer from vulnerabilities. The encryption of biometric data cannot
suﬃciently protect against all types of attacks, for example, spooﬁng attacks,
Marcel et al. [136]. Speciﬁcally, we analyzed the need of anti-spooﬁng techniques
for preventing this kind of attacks. Motivated by rapid progress of adversaries’
actions, we addressed the vulnerabilities of unimodal and multi-factor schemes
under realistic scenarios. An interesting ﬁnding when carrying out this analysis
was that challenge-response approaches can work eﬀectively towards the spooﬁng
attacks in unimodal schemes while the applicability of these mechanisms in
multimodal architectures renders them more robust. Consequently, we proposed
a biometric authentication framework, that combined two modalities and a
liveness detection technique to increase the security levels. Additionally, our
approach involved the secure storage of biometric data in the chip of the
ePassport leveraging the technique of biometric cryptosystems, key-generation
approach to ensure both security and user privacy. We believe that this work will
help to appraise the impact of spooﬁng attacks and contribute to the ongoing
attempts for the public acceptance of government biometric-based deployments.
CONCLUSION
53
Moreover, remote biometric authentication has become popular in eFinance and
ePayment applications, increasing the privacy concerns. We showed that the
mechanism of pseudonymous biometric identities results in privacy-enhanced
designs. The technique was initially introduced in the context of biometric
development projects funded by the European Union, such as TURBINE [215]
and FIDELITY [67]. In our work, we implemented this method in an eFinance
model based on the ﬁndings of these projects. We evaluated our design according
to the existing privacy principles and security recommendations for biometric
protection as addressed by the ISO Standards [92] and the new GDPR [66].
The results showed that our model can follow the ISO recommendations for
the security framework in ﬁnancial services [94]. Finally, we analyzed how the
privacy requirements and concepts, presented in ISO Standards [95], could
be satisﬁed during the technical implementation. We hope that the results of
our research can contribute to the toolkits for secure and privacy-preserving
biometric-based identity management solutions in ﬁnancial services.
Nowadays, the amount of biometric data for recognition purposes has been
increased rapidly, while requires enormous processing and storage capacity. We
analyzed how we can manage these challenges in cloud and we pointed out
the privacy risks to maintain conﬁdentiality and integrity of user’s biometric
data. Moreover, we introduced a distributed approach for secure and privacy-
preserving multimodal Authentication as a Service (AaaS) in an environment
with malicious adversaries. We avoided an additional re-enrollment phase and any
auxiliary temporary or permanent storage of user’s biometrics in a Centralized
Biometric Database (CBDB) in order to decrease any inappropriate use of
personal information that can lead to users’ identity tracking and monitoring.
The design served the criteria that should be addressed from the early stage of the
design, characterizing the architecture, and thus determining the user acceptance,
as addressed in ISO Standards for biometric technologies [96]. Our approach was
designed for authentication applications and it could also operate in identiﬁcation
mode with slight diﬀerences. Nonetheless, there were some limitations, such as
the selected biometric modalities, the matching technique and the fusion strategy
that might aﬀect the complexity and eﬃciency. Our detailed analysis showed
that other options presented weaknesses and their implementation was ineﬃcient.
Finally, our decentralized privacy-preserving protocols may be easily extended
to update the parameters and adjust diﬀerent biometrics, classiﬁers, matching
methods and fusion rules. They are characterized by dynamic functionality and
ﬂexibility in terms of computation and communication eﬃciency. Due to the
potential market value, our approach can oﬀer a cost-eﬀective business model
and serve as a framework for future applications, platforms and systems in
which existing biometric datasets need to be leveraged.
Our main conclusion is that the ﬁeld of security and privacy in biometric
54
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
schemes for authentication and identiﬁcation purposes has received signiﬁcant
attention over the last years. There has been substantial progress and the ﬁeld
of cryptographic techniques for biometric protection is maturing, presenting
mechanisms that can preserve the user’s rights to privacy. However, there is still
room for improvements. An important observation to make is that the biometric
protection involves more than just applying cryptographic primitives and the
practical implementation of privacy-by-design approaches is a challenging task.
In the age of the Internet of Things, we hope that the results of this thesis will
inspire other researchers to properly design more robust biometric architectures.
4.2 Open Problems and Directions for Future Work
Because biometric designs in day-to-day life applications belong to a relatively
young discipline, they oﬀer new research opportunities. There are many open
problems and unanswered questions that deserve a deeper evaluation based on
the ﬁndings of this thesis. In this section, we formulate potential directions for
future work on the security and privacy of biometric designs.
• Evaluation of the encryption mechanisms for the protection of
biometric data. Biometric template protection mechanisms that allow
matching over the encrypted stored biometric data without causing the
degradation of recognition accuracy are a major challenge. Conﬁdence in
the security of an algorithm or a protocol can only be established if they
have been subject to a thorough examination of the research community.
This implies not only using well-scrutinized cryptographic primitives, but
also ﬁnding possible ways to appropriately manage the FAR and FRR
parameters, and to protect the biometric systems against physical attacks.
More models and evaluation methods should be developed to analyze
the optimal trade-oﬀ between performance and security. Additionally,
the desired security properties depend on the type of biometrics, the
targeted use-cases and the applications for which a method is implemented.
Therefore, the evaluation criteria should be related to a particular
biometric modality, the biometric protection strategies, the operational
environment and other assumptions, such as the user privacy objectives.
• Privacy analysis of cryptographic techniques in biometric
schemes. ISO Standards and legal frameworks specify the privacy
principles and the security requirements for the interoperability of
biometric deployments. Nonetheless, there is a function creep where
the technical measures cannot always address the organizational criteria
for the protection of user privacy. This triggers the question whether
OPEN PROBLEMS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK
55
we can adequately keep secret the source of a biometric trait and if we
can come up with privacy-by-design engineering solutions to solve this
issue. In this thesis, we presented some steps towards the understanding
of user privacy in biometric schemes. Future research should deﬁne the
criteria and identify the constraints, considering not only technical, but
also nonfunctional requirements, from the initial phases of the system’s
design and development. A complete threat analysis and risk assessment
should be conducted to evaluate the eﬃciency of encryption techniques.
Guidelines and speciﬁc measures should be developed in order to address
the privacy of the users in critical identity management schemes. Finally,
there is still work to be done on the implementation of privacy-aware
approaches in biometric architectures that need to preserve the property
of anonymity, as deﬁned by Campisi in [39] and addressed by the ISO
Standards for the protection of biometric information [92].
• Providing methodologies for robust multibiometric deploy-
ments. A multimodal design can increase the recognition reliability of
the system in which it is embedded. The fusion of multiple modalities
has a critical role to play in biometric architectures. The fusion strategies
work diﬀerently for every combination and thus deserve further analysis
in order to examine the optimum selection of data, algorithms, levels of
fusion, rules and techniques. The reliability of a fusion approach should
be assessed over the range of the retrieval FAR and FRR. Additionally,
the advantages of multimodal deployments have shifted the eﬀorts to the
combination of cryptology and multibiometrics, Kanade et al. [109]. The
incorporation of multiple biometrics in template protection and biometric
cryptosystems techniques can oﬀer new security advantages. Multimodal
encrypted schemes, such as ﬁngerprint-face-iris, can provide better security
levels than their unimodal components, Tiwari and Gupta [206]. An
intriguing question is whether it is possible to design the tools and set
the criteria for the evaluation of the cryptographic mechanisms applied
in multimodal architectures. The design of a generalized encryption
framework for multibiometric data, which will not be aﬀected by the
used biometric extraction algorithms, representation techniques and the
selected fusion approaches could be the ﬁrst step towards this direction.
To eﬃciently address the accuracy and scalability, a multimodal system
should be tested on a large representative database (DB), obtained from
a diverse population of individuals. The absence of legal multimodal DBs
limits the research margins. This issue should be addressed in order to
study and evaluate the security of multimodal models. Although these
processes will be costly, time and eﬀort consuming, the beneﬁts that will
be derived can lead to the design of robust multimodal biometric schemes
in high security systems, building and maintaining authentic public trust.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
• Developing anti-spooﬁng tools for secure biometric deploy-
ments. The art of attacking biometric systems has gained sophistication
over the past years, Marasco and Ross [135]. In this direction, anti-spooﬁng
methods can used to improve the robustness of biometrics. Multimodal
schemes are one of the proposed approaches for the design of anti-spooﬁng
technologies, Marcel et al. [136]. The research area has received great
attention presenting promising results in facial recognition biometric
deployments, mainly used in civilian applications of the government
sector, Beham and Roomi [16] and Juels et al. [106]. However, not
all of the existing techniques are commercially available, due to their
cost and the lack of evaluation measures. Multibiometric anti-spooﬁng
is currently an open problem in this ﬁeld, Biggio et al. [22]. It is
important to understand whether and to what extent the fusion rules
are vulnerable to spooﬁng attacks, and under what circumstances the
rules may be more secure than others. We suggest future work on
targeted attacks on diﬀerent combinations of biometrics to address the
security of multimodal recognition systems. Finally, there is a need for
designing generalized countermeasures and testing their stability and
resistance under various spooﬁng algorithms. To increase the eﬀectiveness,
practicality and consequently the applicability, simple yet eﬀective defenses
towards more realistic models are required, both at the hardware and
software level of biometric schemes, while managing complexity and cost.
• Security and privacy analysis of new biometric-based schemes
in cloud applications. The growing adoption rate of biometric designs
in the web-enabled world has paved the way to a challenging research
agenda for practically secure mechanisms. We identiﬁed several directions
for future work on BaaS. The protection of user’s information remains the
biggest challenge for the migration of biometrics to a web interface. It is
important to conduct a risk assessment for outsourcing the stored biometric
data in the cloud. A complete threat analysis is necessary in order to study
how it is possible to avoid the correlation of helper data originating from
diﬀerent DBs that can reveal the identity of the user and link his identity
to other applications. Moreover, cloud-based IdMaaS and AaaS providers
may use diﬀerent security primitives and privacy regulations which may
limit the ﬂexibility of multimodal AaaS. Hence, research in this direction
for the design of a framework with uniﬁed protection techniques and
evaluation criteria would be valuable. For multimodal AaaS architectures,
future work should be focused on the impact of matching algorithms,
normalization techniques, fusion approaches and applied cryptographic
mechanisms on the system’s overall accuracy. For identiﬁcation purposes,
the size of the DBs should be taken into account, for the evaluation of
scalability in terms of computation and complexity.
