1. Many operations in the embedding example are not supported on GPUs. It would be helpful to have documentation that details these unsupported operations.

2. To work around this issue, I attempted to use `tf.ConfigProto(allow_soft_placement=True)`. However, I now encounter the following error: 
   ```
   Executor failed to create kernel. Invalid argument: AttrValue must not have reference type value of float_ref for attr 'tensor_type'.
   ```

Thank you,
