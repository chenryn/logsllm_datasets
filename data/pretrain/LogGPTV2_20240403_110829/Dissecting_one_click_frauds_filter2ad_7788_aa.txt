ABSTRACT
1.
INTRODUCTION
“One Click Fraud” is an online conﬁdence scam that has been
plaguing an increasing number of Japanese Internet users, in spite
of new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam,
the victim clicks on a link presented to them, only to be informed
that they just entered a binding contract and are required to pay
a registration fee for a service. Even though no money is legally
owed, a large number of users prefer to pay up, because of po-
tential embarrassment due to the type of service “requested” (e.g.,
pornographic goods).
Using public reports of fraudulent websites as a source of data,
we analyze over 2,000 reported One Click Frauds incidents. By
correlating several attributes (WHOIS data, bank accounts, phone
numbers, malware installed...), we discover that a few fraudsters
are seemingly responsible for a majority of the scams, and evidence
a number of loopholes these miscreants exploit. We further show
that, while some of these sites may also be engaging in other il-
licit activities such as spamming, the connection between different
types of scams is not as obvious as we initially expected. Last, we
show that the rise in the number of these frauds is fueled by high
expected monetary gains in return for very little risk. The quantita-
tive data obtained gives us an interesting window on the economic
dynamics of some online criminal syndicates.

In the family apartment in Tokyo, Ken is sitting at his computer,
casually browsing the free section of a mildly erotic website. Sud-
denly, a window pops up, telling him,
Thank you for your patronage! You successfully reg-
istered for our premium online services, at an incred-
ible price of 50,000 JPY.1 Please promptly send your
payment by bank transfer to ABC Ltd at Ginko Bank,
Account 1234567. Questions? Please contact us at
080-1234-1234.
Your IP address is 10.1.2.3, you run Firefox 3.5 over
Windows XP, and you are connecting from Tokyo.
Failure to send your payment promptly will force us
to mail you a postcard reminder to your home address.
Customers refusing to pay will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law.
Once again, thank you for your patronage!
A sample postcard reminder is shown on the screen, and consists
of a scantily clad woman in a provocative pose. Ken has a sud-
den panic attack: He is married, and, if his wife were to ﬁnd out
about his browsing habits, his marriage would be in trouble, pos-
sibly ending in divorce, and public shame. In his frenzied state of
mind, Ken also fears that, if anybody at his company heard about
this, he could lose his job. Obviously, those website operators know
who he is and where he lives, and could make his life very difﬁcult.
Now, 50,000 JPY (≈ USD 500) seems like a small price to pay to
make all of this go away. Ken immediately jots down the contact
information, goes to the nearest bank, and acquits himself of his
supposed debt.
Ken has just been the victim of a relatively common online scam
perpetrated in Japan, called “One Click Fraud.” In this fraud, the
“customer,” i.e., the victim, does not enter any legally binding agree-
ment, and the perpetrators only have marginal information about
the client that connected to their website (IP address, User-Agent
string), which does not reveal much about the user.2 However, fac-
ing a display of authority stressed by the language used, includ-
ing the notion that they are monitored, and a sense of shame from
browsing sites with questionable contents, most victims do not re-
alize they are part of an extortion scam. Some victims even call
up the phone numbers provided in hopes of resolving the situation,
1Over the past ﬁve years, on average, 100 JPY≈ 1 USD.

prints can divulge considerable information about the user. How-
ever, none of the One Click Fraud websites we investigated appears
to use any advanced browser ﬁngerprinting techniques.
15and disclose private information, such as name or address, to their
tormentors, which makes them even more vulnerable to blackmail.
As a result, One Click Frauds have been very successful in Japan.
Annual police reports show that the estimated amount of mone-
tary damages stemming from One Click Frauds and related con-
ﬁdence scams are roughly 26 billion JPY per year (i.e., USD 260
million/year). The rapid rise of such frauds has led to new laws be-
ing passed [18, 20], to the deployment of police task forces specif-
ically put in charge of solving these frauds, and to specialized help
desks [16]. In addition, there have been so far, on average 657 ar-
rests and 2,859 solved cases per year [15]. Considering the lack of
technical sophistication needed to set up such extortion schemes,
and the fact that bank accounts and phone numbers can be made
very hard to trace in Japan (discussed in Section 5), it appears that
One Click Frauds offer easy money to aspiring criminals.
From a research point of view, One Click Frauds offer a unique
opportunity for a case study in online crime economics. First, One
Click Frauds, are extremely localized. We have not seen any in-
stance of this speciﬁc fraud outside of Japan, presumably due to the
fact that the scammers prey on unique Japanese cultural character-
istics, such as respect of authority, or embarrassment at the idea of
causing trouble. Rather than limiting our research, we view this lo-
cal aspect as an opportunity. Indeed, because One Click Frauds are
contained to Japan, and are almost exclusively used in Japanese-
language websites, we can obtain a relatively exhaustive view of
how these frauds are deployed and the characteristics they share,
without the need for a complex measurement infrastructure. Fur-
thermore, One Click Frauds, albeit unique, are very closely related
to the body of scareware scams (e.g., windows popping up trying
to entice users to buy fake anti-virus software) that are becoming
increasingly pervasive, and we believe One Click Frauds offer an
interesting insights into this type of criminal enterprise.
The ﬁrst contribution of this paper is to collect and analyze a
corpus of over 2,000 reported One Click Fraud incidents, and to use
the data collected to paint a relatively clear picture of the economic
dynamics of an instance of online criminal activity.
Speciﬁcally, we set out to answer the following questions: Who
is committing these frauds? Are One Click Frauds the product of
organized criminal activities, or are they more artisanal in nature,
with many aspiring crooks trying their luck? How much do crimi-
nals stand to gain? Are there vulnerabilities in the network infras-
tructure (e.g., weak registration processes, easy access to compro-
mised accounts, etc...) that are easily exploited by the miscreants?
In the process of ﬁnding answers to these questions, a second im-
portant contribution of our paper is to provide monetary amounts,
which help dimension the size of the One Click Fraud market, and
the proﬁts potentially made. While economic modeling of cyber-
crime has been an increasingly active research topic (see for in-
stance [12,17,23,25,36]), we believe that obtaining additional mea-
surements and clearly detailing the methodology we employ should
help enrich our knowledge of how online criminal syndicates oper-
ate, while assuaging concerns on the validity of the estimates for-
mulated [14]. Furthermore, some of the measurement methodol-
ogy we employ is likely to be applicable beyond the context of One
Click Frauds.
Moreover, our analysis methodology can be helpful to law en-
forcement agencies. Law enforcement typically assigns different
fraud instances to speciﬁc agents, who mostly operate indepen-
dently of each other. However, we show that, by analyzing a rel-
atively large dataset of frauds, we can extract characteristics that
are not visible when considering smaller subsets of these frauds.
These characteristics can in turn be useful to law enforcement in
identifying, and perhaps prosecuting, the miscreants behind these
crimes [30].
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review the
related work in Section 2. We then explain our data collection
methodology in Section 3. We turn to analyzing the data collected
in Section 4. We use this analysis to study economic incentives for
the perpetrators in Section 5, before discussing the implications of
our study, and drawing brief conclusions in Section 6.
2. RELATED WORK
Moore et al. contend that online crime has become economically
signiﬁcant since around 2004 [23]. Hence, research in measuring
the economic impact of online crime is a relatively recent ﬁeld, but
a number of papers on the topic have been published in the past
couple of years. We present several important advances in the ﬁeld
in this section, and refer the reader to Moore et al. [23] for a more
exhaustive treatment of the literature.
Some of the pioneering work in the ﬁeld has tried to quantify
the value of fraudulent ﬁnancial credentials as well as that of com-
promised hosts (“bots”), through passive observations. In particu-
lar, Thomas and Martin [31], and Franklin et al. [12] monitor IRC
channels where miscreants attempt to sell commodities as diverse
as stolen credit card numbers, bank account credentials, or email
databases for spam, to obtain estimates of the value of these items
as well as the volumes of the market associated with exchanges of
such goods.
Along the same lines, Zhuge et al. [39] describe how criminals
operate in Chinese underground markets, and provide some insight
regarding some of the goods exchanged in these markets by mon-
itoring web forums where such items are advertised; a particularly
popular item appears to be forged or stolen online video game cur-
rency.
Passive monitoring, as discussed above, has been criticized for
only measuring advertised prices, as opposed to actual realized
sales [14]. A more recent line of research addresses this concern
by actively participating in the online exchanges, by essentially
“hijacking” some of the infrastructure used by miscreants. Kanich
et al. [17] inﬁltrate a large botnet, and modify some of the spam
trafﬁc generated by the botnet to redirect purchases to a server un-
der their control, thereby acquiring data on spam conversion rates.
The key insight is that 350 million spam messages sent resulted in
28 sales. In other words, Kanich et al. measure very low conver-
sion rates in their experiment. But, considering the cost of spam
is negligible, and that bots can be used to generate other forms of
proﬁt (e.g., phishing site hosting), spam remains a relatively pop-
ular form of crime. Furthermore, a study of spam on the Twitter
social networking site [13] shows considerably higher click rates
(0.13%) than previously observed in email spam, which illustrates
that spam remains economically relevant. Other relevant measure-
ment studies include a botnet take-over described in Stone-Gross et
al. [29], who monitor the type of services supported by the Torpig
botnet. In a similar vein, Wondracek et al. [36] focus on the eco-
nomics of the distribution of pornographic materials, by covertly
operating an adult web server.
Perhaps closer in spirit to the methodology we employ in this pa-
per, a signiﬁcant body of literature [21, 22, 24] is devoted to quanti-
fying the economic impact of phishing scams, as well as the modus
operandi of the attackers. One of the main outcomes of this line
of research is to evidence that a large proportion of phishing activ-
ities are carried out by a modest number of phishing gangs, who
use relatively sophisticated “fast-ﬂux” techniques, where phishing
sites are used as disposable commodities hosted on compromised
hosts. This body of research puts the number of phishing web-
16sites at around 116,000. Likewise, Moore and Edelman [25] gather
a large corpus of data on typosquatting domains, to quantify the
economic value of such sites, as well as potential disincentives for
advertisement networks to intervene forcefully. Finally, Provos et
al. [26] provide a comprehensive overview of web-based malware
distribution, showing that there are in excess of 3 million web pages
attempting to infect their visitors.
The work we present here is complementary to the existing liter-
ature. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time One Click Frauds are
analyzed from a quantitative and technical perspective. (Research
on the legal ramiﬁcations and countermeasures, on the other hand,
has been active [18].) More generally, we focus on a relatively
contained instance of a scam, and attempt to gather both economic
data (potential revenue, deployment costs to the perpetrators...) and
structural data (number of players, relationships between players,
...) through a systematic measurement methodology, which we be-
lieve can be useful beyond the study of this speciﬁc fraud.
3. DATA COLLECTION
To ﬁnd instances of One Click Frauds, we rely on public forums
which report fraud incidents, along with details regarding the web-
site being used, the amount of money extorted, as well as fraudster
contact information (bank account number, phone number, ...). We
collect data from three public forums:
2 Channel BBS [5]: The largest bulletin board in Japan, which pro-
vides discussion threads on various topics ranging from Japanese
anime to sports. Several ongoing threads are dedicated to exposing
One Click Frauds.
Koguma-neko Teikoku [2]: Privately owned website providing
help to solve consumer problems related to online activities. A sec-
tion of the site is devoted to describing One Click Frauds, including
information about scam incidents.
Wan-Cli Zukan [7]: Privately owned website solely devoted to
exposing websites partaking in One Click Frauds.
Collection methodology. We gather data posted on the three web-
sites we polled over a period of roughly three years (2006-2009).
Speciﬁcally, we collect 2 Channel posts made between March 6,
2006 and October 26, 2009, Koguma-neko Teikoku posts made be-
tween August 24, 2006 and August 14, 2009, and Wan-Cli Zukan
posts made between September 6, 2006 and October 26, 2009. All
in all, we gathered 2,140 incident reports. Collection of this data
took place between May and November 2009. While it is difﬁcult
to determine how exhaustive our data collection is compared to the
total number of frauds perpetrated, we note that there is a signiﬁ-
cant overlap in the data provided by all three sites, which indicates
we probably captured the most successful frauds, and that our cov-
erage is likely adequate.
Initially, we also tried to extract information from data provided
by the Japanese police [32]. Unfortunately, these reports are in im-
age format, and do not contain much actionable information, even
after using optical character recognition. Indeed, most of the inter-
esting details (e.g., bank account used) are often not divulged.
Data parsing. The three sites present marked differences. 2 Chan-
nel is based on anonymous postings from various users who have
encountered a One Click Fraud website and post notiﬁcations to
other users. Due to its popularity and large user base, 2 Chan-
nel contains a wealth of information. However, because 2 Chan-
nel threads are essentially an open discussion, parsing the data
for useful input is challenging. Koguma-neko Teikoku is also a
collaborative web space, but, different from 2 Channel, Koguma-
neko Teikoku requires posters to input information about One Click
Frauds in a speciﬁed format. Finally, Wan-Cli Zukan is closer to a
blog, where the website owner periodically posts notiﬁcations in a
ﬁxed format. Outsiders cannot directly post to the site.
Parsing the data from Wan-Cli Zukan and Koguma-neko Teikoku
is straightforward, as both sites use a predetermined format for all
posts relevant to One Click Frauds. Likewise, the data is of high
quality. Randomly sampling the reported sites, we did not ﬁnd a
single instance of slander – i.e., benign sites which would be re-
ported as fraudulent. Either the sites reported were, indeed, hosting
One Click Frauds, or they had been recently taken down.
Figure 1: Example of 2 Channel posting. The lack of structure
makes parsing slightly complex. Here, usable information is
only contained in the squared area; oftentimes, formatting is
even more haphazard.
On the other hand, 2 Channel is considerably more challeng-
ing to use. An example of 2 Channel posting is shown in Fig. 1.
Since the data is not formatted according to a speciﬁc standard, we
have to perform some basic text segmentation. Adding to the difﬁ-
culty, is the fact that the Japanese language does not have a rich set
of punctuation rules. For instance, words are rarely separated by
spaces, there is no capitalization, and most characters have a cou-
ple of different readings depending on the context. Furthermore,
in forums like 2 Channel, specialized slang and abbreviations are
the norm, rather than the exception. To perform text extraction,
we use the MeCab parser and data analyzer [4]. MeCab extracts
Japanese characters into semantic units. This allows us to obtain a
list of tokens, such as “ginko” (bank), “Sumitomo” (name), “hut-
suu” (usual), “1234567.” We can then perform context-dependent
parsing. The previous series of token tells us that it is highly likely
that the poster talks about a “usual” checking account number 1234567
at Sumitomo bank.
Despite the added difﬁculty of parsing 2 Channel threads, we did
not encounter any erroneous or libelous postings. While a certain
level of verbal abuse is present in such an unmoderated forum, it is
easily separated from relevant information, once text segmentation
is performed.
Extracted attributes. For all three sources of data, after having
parsed and cleaned the input, we extract the following attributes:
URL of the fraudulent website; Bank account number given by
the fraudster for remittance of funds; Bank name; Branch name;
Account holder name; Contact phone number; Registration fee re-
quested (i.e., amount of the fraud).
Some of these attributes (e.g., account holder name) are probably
fake. However, for the fraudsters to be able to receive money, the
ﬁnancial information has to be genuine. Likewise, contact informa-

tion (email and phone numbers), when present, is usually accurate,
as miscreants provide the victims with a way of “calling back” to
further their social engineering attacks.
Table 1 describes the number of fraud incidents that we extracted
from each of the three sources of data. Note that, these sources
are not mutually exclusive.
In fact, we have signiﬁcant overlap
between the different sources.
Second, the raw data that we extract needs to be cleaned up
signiﬁcantly. A number of records are incomplete to some ex-
tent (missing phone number for example); out of these incomplete
records, particularly problematic are records that do not contain a
URL ﬁeld, as the existence of a fraud cannot be veriﬁed. In addi-
tion, a number of records are ambiguous in that some ﬁelds have
more than one entry. For instance, a given post may contain one
URL but several phone numbers. Most of these records need to be
scrutinized manually, to check whether parsing was done correctly
and whether the record indeed contains several ﬁelds.
All results are stored in a MySQL database. We illustrate a typ-
ical entry in our database in Table 2. To help make our experi-
ments reproducible, we make a copy of a dump of our database
available (in gzip’ed form) at http://arima.ini.cmu.edu/
public/oneclick.sql.gz.
After having cleaned up our original dataset, we use the extracted
URL to infer the domain hosting the fraud, and, whenever possi-
ble, to obtain registrar (“WHOIS”) information. We also period-
ically download the corresponding website (using wget in recur-
sive mode) to check for potential changes indicating a take-down,
and to check for the presence of malware on the fraudulent site.
Note that, due to the time interval (three years) over which inci-
dent reports we collect were reported, a signiﬁcant amount of data
points to sites that have long been taken down. Thus, a number of
records are hard to verify and may be missing information. For ex-
ample, we have a smaller number of entries with valid DNS domain
information, compared to the number of incidents reported.
4. DATA ANALYSIS
We next turn to analyzing the relatively large corpus of One
Click Frauds we gathered. Speciﬁcally, we seek loopholes in the
infrastructure that attackers are able to exploit. We then try to as-
sess some of the characteristics of the online criminal market be-
hind One Click Frauds, and in particular, investigate whether some
miscreants are responsible for several frauds. Last, we try to de-
termine whether fraudsters engage in other illicit activities beyond
One Click Fraud.
