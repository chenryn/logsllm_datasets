## Abstract
One-Click Fraud is an online confidence scam that has been increasingly affecting Japanese Internet users, despite new laws and the mobilization of police task forces. In this scam, victims are tricked into clicking a link, only to be informed that they have entered a binding contract and must pay a registration fee for a service. Even though no legal obligation exists, many victims choose to pay to avoid potential embarrassment, especially if the "service" involves sensitive content like pornography.

Using public reports of fraudulent websites, we analyze over 2,000 reported One-Click Fraud incidents. By correlating various attributes (WHOIS data, bank accounts, phone numbers, malware), we discover that a few fraudsters are responsible for a majority of the scams and exploit several loopholes. We also show that, while some of these sites may engage in other illicit activities such as spamming, the connection between different types of scams is not as straightforward as initially thought. Finally, we demonstrate that the rise in One-Click Frauds is driven by high expected monetary gains with minimal risk. The quantitative data provides insights into the economic dynamics of online criminal syndicates.

## 1. Introduction
In a typical scenario, Ken, a resident of Tokyo, is browsing a mildly erotic website when a pop-up window appears, informing him that he has registered for a premium service and must pay 50,000 JPY (approximately USD 500) to ABC Ltd. The message includes his IP address, browser, and location, threatening legal action and public embarrassment if he fails to pay. Fearing the consequences, Ken decides to pay, becoming a victim of a One-Click Fraud.

One-Click Fraud is a common online scam in Japan, where victims are tricked into believing they have entered a binding contract and must pay a fee. Despite the lack of legal obligation, many victims pay to avoid embarrassment. Annual police reports estimate that One-Click Frauds and related confidence scams cause approximately 26 billion JPY (USD 260 million) in damages per year. This has led to new laws, specialized police task forces, and help desks. However, the low technical sophistication required and the ease of obtaining untraceable bank accounts and phone numbers make One-Click Frauds attractive to aspiring criminals.

From a research perspective, One-Click Frauds provide a unique case study in online crime economics. These scams are highly localized to Japan, making it possible to gather comprehensive data on their deployment and characteristics. Additionally, One-Click Frauds share similarities with scareware scams, offering insights into broader criminal enterprises.

The main contributions of this paper are:
1. Collecting and analyzing over 2,000 reported One-Click Fraud incidents to understand the economic dynamics of online criminal activity.
2. Providing monetary amounts and detailed methodology to enrich our understanding of how online criminal syndicates operate.

## 2. Related Work
Research on the economic impact of online crime has gained prominence since around 2004. Pioneering studies have quantified the value of fraudulent financial credentials and compromised hosts through passive observations. For example, Thomas and Martin [31] and Franklin et al. [12] monitored IRC channels to estimate the value of stolen credit card numbers and email databases.

Recent research has addressed the limitations of passive monitoring by actively participating in online exchanges. Kanich et al. [17] infiltrated a botnet to measure spam conversion rates, finding that 350 million spam messages resulted in 28 sales. Other studies, such as Wondracek et al. [36], have focused on the economics of distributing pornographic materials.

Phishing scams have also been extensively studied, with research showing that a small number of phishing gangs use sophisticated techniques to host disposable phishing sites. Moore and Edelman [25] analyzed typosquatting domains, while Provos et al. [26] provided an overview of web-based malware distribution.

Our work complements existing literature by providing the first quantitative and technical analysis of One-Click Frauds, focusing on both economic and structural data.

## 3. Data Collection
To identify instances of One-Click Frauds, we relied on public forums that report fraud incidents, including details about the websites, extorted amounts, and fraudster contact information. We collected data from three sources:
1. **2 Channel BBS**: The largest bulletin board in Japan, with threads dedicated to exposing One-Click Frauds.
2. **Koguma-neko Teikoku**: A privately owned website providing help for consumer problems related to online activities.
3. **Wan-Cli Zukan**: A privately owned website solely devoted to exposing One-Click Fraud websites.

### Collection Methodology
We gathered data from the three websites over a period of roughly three years (2006-2009). Specifically, we collected:
- 2 Channel posts from March 6, 2006, to October 26, 2009.
- Koguma-neko Teikoku posts from August 24, 2006, to August 14, 2009.
- Wan-Cli Zukan posts from September 6, 2006, to October 26, 2009.

In total, we gathered 2,140 incident reports. While it is difficult to determine the exhaustiveness of our data collection, the significant overlap in data from the three sources suggests that we captured the most successful frauds.

### Data Parsing
The three sites present different formats:
- **2 Channel**: Anonymous postings with rich but unstructured information.
- **Koguma-neko Teikoku**: Collaborative space with a specified format for reporting One-Click Frauds.
- **Wan-Cli Zukan**: Blog-like site with periodic notifications in a fixed format.

Parsing data from Wan-Cli Zukan and Koguma-neko Teikoku is straightforward due to their structured formats. 2 Channel, however, requires more complex text segmentation using tools like MeCab to extract meaningful information.

### Extracted Attributes
For all three sources, we extracted the following attributes:
- URL of the fraudulent website
- Bank account number
- Bank name
- Branch name
- Account holder name
- Contact phone number
- Registration fee requested

Table 1 summarizes the number of extracted fraud incidents from each source.

| Data Source | Unambiguous, w/ URL | Unambiguous, w/o URL | Ambiguous, w/ URL | Ambiguous, w/o URL |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 2 Channel   | 1077                | 372                  | 691               | 353                |
| Koguma-neko | 174                 | 218                  | 332               | 2                  |
| Wan-Cli Zukan | 362                | 8                    | 632               | 59                 |

### Data Cleaning
We cleaned the raw data, addressing incomplete records and ambiguous fields. All results were stored in a MySQL database, and a dump of the database is available for reproducibility.

## 4. Data Analysis
We analyzed the corpus of One-Click Frauds to identify infrastructure loopholes, characteristics of the online criminal market, and whether fraudsters engage in other illicit activities.

### Registrar Analysis
We examined the registrars used in One-Click Frauds, comparing them to the overall market share. Table 3 shows the top registrars and their usage in One-Click Frauds.

| Registrar            | Market Share (%) | Proportion of Frauds (%) |
|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Go Daddy             | 29.08            | 47.56                    |
| ENom                 | 8.30             | 17.48                    |
| Tucows               | 6.82             | 5.14                     |
| Network Solutions    | 6.06             | 4.11                     |
| Schlund + Partners   | 4.38             | 3.34                     |
| Melbourne IT         | 4.34             | 2.83                     |
| Wild West Domains    | 2.89             | 1.54                     |
| Moniker              | 2.43             | 1.29                     |
| Register.com         | 2.40             | 1.03                     |
| Public Domain Registry | 2.17          | 1.03                     |
| OTHER                | -                | 13.62                    |

This analysis reveals that a few registrars are disproportionately used in One-Click Frauds, suggesting potential vulnerabilities in the registration process.

### Conclusion
Our analysis of One-Click Frauds provides valuable insights into the economic and structural aspects of online criminal activity. By identifying key players and infrastructure weaknesses, we hope to contribute to more effective countermeasures and law enforcement efforts.
