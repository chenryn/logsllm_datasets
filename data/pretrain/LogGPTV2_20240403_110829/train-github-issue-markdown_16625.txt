Request header keys are being encoded and then checked for later. In python 3
this is causing issues.
In an example use case, if `Content-Type` is explicitly set, when making a
post request, you end up getting both the user-set type and the default type,
eg: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

    headers = dict((name.encode('ascii'), value) for name, value in headers.items())
https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/blob/master/requests/models.py#L417
    # Add content-type if it wasn't explicitly provided.
    if (content_type) and (not 'content-type' in self.headers):
                self.headers['Content-Type'] = content_type
