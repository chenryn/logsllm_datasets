User: I use Windows XP and Python 2.5. I am trying to make a way for my python programs to secretly communicate with each other, I think the STARTUPOPTIONS class could hide the window, but I can't find out how I could communicate with them. On my python subprocess I tried using raw_input and on the parent I tried writing to the Popen.stdin and flushing it, but it diden't seam to work. I would use Popen.communicate, but that waits for the process to exit. Is there a way to do this? Thanks!
EDIT:
I am going to only make my program available for windows users so if there is a module that is only available for windows, I will not mind it can't run on other Operating Systems.
Assistant: Check this out: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/async_subprocess/0.2.1
"Provides an asynchronous version of Popen.communicate"
