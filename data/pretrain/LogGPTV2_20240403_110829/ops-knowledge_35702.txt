Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am interested in learning Python and Ruby, but I use Windows 7. Most of the online resources I have found focus on using these programming languages in a UNIX environment, which is not very helpful for me.

Could you recommend any articles or books that are more tailored to Windows users? I am looking for resources that will help me get started with Python and Ruby in a Windows environment.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations.

P.S. I have read "Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python," but it might be too basic for someone with some programming experience already.
