User: I am interested in learning python and ruby, but I use Windows 7. Most online articles I have seen out there are not really helpful to me since they are all explaining about python and ruby in UNIX environment.
I'd like to know if there are any good articles/books about Ruby/python programming languages that are more friendly to windows users that may be useful. 
Thanks in advance. any recommendations would be appreciated.
Assistant: Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python, I have read this but it might be too easy for people with some programming experience already
