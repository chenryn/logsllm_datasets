after 1 week, we asked them whether they had written down the
password after password recall process and explicitly told them
that the answer did not affect payment to reduce any intention of
deceiving. Approximately 80% indicated that they did not write
down the password or the sentence (in MneGenEx and MnePerEx)
and the ratio from the three conditions is similar, indicating that
participants using mnemonic strategy variants were as conﬁdent as
those in the control group that they could remember the passwords.
We analyzed the password memorability from the participants who
claimed that they did not write down passwords or sentences.
About 38% of participants recalled the passwords successfully
within ﬁrst two attempts, and an extra 7% of participants were able
to recall the passwords when the strategy was displayed as a hint.
The ﬁnal successful recall rate did not differ signiﬁcantly among

creased for each condition, which is in agreement with previous

ﬁnding [39]. And the increase in rates was larger for the mnemonic
strategy, especially for the MneGenEx variant.
Long-term recall time. The password recall time in Control
was shorter than that for MneGenEx (t = 3.24, p = 0.001) or
MnePerEx (t = 1.80, p = 0.073), whereas there was no signiﬁ-
cant difference between MneGenEx and MnePerEx (t = 0.73, p =
0.46). Whether or not short-term recall had been required did not
have any signiﬁcant impacts.
Workload. The workload of password recall evaluated by TLX is
illustrated in Fig 4(b). Comparing Fig 4(a) and Fig 4(b), perhaps
the most noticeable difference is that the subscale of performance in
Fig 4(b) is almost double that in Fig 4(a), which was mainly due to
large portion of failed recall. Except physical demand and temporal
demand, which are not directly related to the task, the average rates
of all the other 3 subscales also increased dramatically, suggesting
that password recall was more difﬁcult than password generation.
For the subscales, mental workload and frustration ratings of
mnemonics strategy variants were higher than those of the Control,
and no signiﬁcant difference was observed between MneGenEx
and MnePerEx, which is consistent with the ﬁrst phase results, sug-
gesting the overhead from the extra requirements of the mnemonic
strategy.
Password update. At the end of the task, we asked participants to
update the password, without any restriction except that the pass-
word could not be the same as the old one. For MneGenEx and
MnePerEx, after the password was created, we asked participants
whether they used the strategy we provided. About 70% of partici-
pants said “yes” to the question, and the percentage for MnePerEx
was slightly higher. The results indicated that most of the partici-
pants were willing to use the instructed strategy even if not forced
to do so.
Overall,
the study suggests that although workload required
for the mnemonic strategy variants is signiﬁcantly larger than
that for Control, no signiﬁcant difference in password recall be-
tween mnemonic strategy variants and the control group is ob-
served, which is consistent with the previous literature [44, 45].
MnePerEx, which shows advantage over MneGenEx in terms of
security, performs similar to MneGenEx in all the measurements
regarding usability.
6. DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the consequence of our security eval-
uation ﬁndings and also present our study limitations.
6.1
Impact of Security Assessment
We observed that the security of the mnemonic strategy is highly
sensitive to the exact instructions and examples presented to the
user. We showed that the generic and commonly suggested instruc-
tions and examples resulted in high β-guess-rates in both sentence
choices and the resulted passwords. As a result, if the mnemonic
strategy with generic instructions and examples is widely adopted
by a large population, the resulting passwords are not likely to be
stronger than the baseline passwords (i.e., passwords created by
users without following any particular strategy), which are consid-
ered to be weak and predictable. If an adversary is equipped with a
specially-designed cracking mechanism, such as the one presented
in Section 4.3, he will still be able to break into a large number
of password-protected user accounts within a limited number of
attempts. We also observed that explicitly requiring personalized
choices of sentences as well as providing good personalized ex-
amples signiﬁcantly enhance the security of the strategy. Notably,
in our study, we witnessed that no sentences or passwords were
chosen more than twice in MnePerEx. Even though with a larger
dataset we may observe duplicated passwords, the number of pass-
word repetition, however, is likely to be signiﬁcantly lower com-
pared to the baseline.
Our ﬁndings suggest the following recommendation: when of-
fering instructions for teaching the mnemonic sentence based pass-
word generation strategy, we recommend including the additional
requirement of personalized choice of sentences as well as concrete
example(s). More generally, one should pay attention to the exact
wording of instructions for describing other password generation
strategies, and for other messages aiming to communicate security-
relevant messages. Furthermore, using examples is an important
aspect of such communication, as apparently a portion of the users
do not follow what appear to be straightforward instructions with-
out concrete examples.
The fact that passwords generated under MneGenEx, using the
generic version of the instructions, are considered to be strong un-
der standard cracking methods, even though they contain a high
level of collisions, suggests that previous password studies that use
cracking as the only method to assess strength of passwords cre-
ated under different conditions (e.g., under different composition
policies) are limited. It would be interesting to revisit some of the
studies using statistical metrics.
6.2 Study Limitations
Ecological validity. We conducted our study with the MTurk popu-
lation, which is more diverse than the participants in typical labora-
tory studies [13]. The use of MTurk also allowed us to recruit more
participants and collect data from a larger and diverse population,
which is hard to achieve in a traditional in-person data collection
study. The downside is that the participants’ behavior in the simu-
lated study setting may be different from real-world scenarios. This
is a concern shared by all studies that use MTurk.
Why two separate studies. In this paper, the evaluation of the se-
curity and memorability of the mnemonic strategy were carried out
in two separate studies. When we were designing Study 1, we were
principally interested in the security of the resulting passwords, in
part because we believed that the usability of the mnemonic strat-
egy had been convincingly established by previous studies, e.g.,
Yan et al.’s [44, 45] study, which have participants actually using
passwords created under the strategy. We thus did not ask partici-
pants to come back after the study to assess the longer-term mem-
orability of the passwords. Only after Study 1 had been underway
did we realize that the precise instructions play an important role
in the level of security, and then the natural research question of
whether different instructions would also affect the usability comes
up. We thus carried out Study 2 to compare MnePerEx, the condi-
tion best for security, with MneGenEx and a control condition.
To make the situation in Study 2 to be as close to real-world sit-
uations as possible, we made a few changes in Study 2 compared
with Study 1. First, in Study 2 participants were presented with in-
formation about a ﬁctitious bank and asked to create a password for
that bank. Second, in Study 2, while participants were still asked to
type in the sentence they were using for creating the passwords (in
part to help ensure that they were following the strategy), when they
entered the password, the sentence was hidden from view. Third,
participants were told that they would be asked to return in one
week for another study during which they would be asked to re-
call the password. Due to these differences, we believe that these
two studies should be viewed as separate from each other, and data
should be compared only with those from the same study. Study 1
assessed the security of 6 variants, and Study 2 assessed the usabil-
ity, including creation mental workload and memorability, of 2 of
