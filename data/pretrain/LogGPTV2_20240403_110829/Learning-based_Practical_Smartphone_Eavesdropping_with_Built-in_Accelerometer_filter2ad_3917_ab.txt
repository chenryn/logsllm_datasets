more robust as we investigate a comprehensive set of factors
and address them with effective preprocessing approaches.
Moreover, we are the ﬁrst to implement accelerometer-based
speech reconstruction and report that accelerometers on recent
smartphones almost cover the entire fundamental frequency
band of adult speech.
C. Other Topics Related to AccelEve
In the literature, accelerometers and gyroscopes have been
extensively studied to sense vibrations in various application
scenarios. Marquardt et al. [29] use the accelerometer in a
smartphone to collect and decode vibration signals incurred
by the keypresses on a nearby keyboard, so as to infer the text
entered by the user. Owusu et al. [34], Miluzzo et al. [33],
Xu et al. [42] and Cai et al. [10] show that motion sensors
on a smartphone can be utilized to infer keystrokes on its
touch screen. Matovu et al. [31] show that a smartpone’s
accelerometer measurements can be used to detect and classify
songs played by the smartphone. Son et al. [37] explore
the possibility of incapacitating a drone through generating
a sound noise at the resonant frequencies of the gyroscope
on that drone. Feng et al. [17] propose an accelerometer-
based continuous authentication system for voice assistants
(e.g., Siri and Google Now). Through cross-checking the voice
input with a wireless accelerometer attached to the user’s
skin, the system enables the voice assistant to differentiate
the owner’s command from voice signals that originate from
others. VibWrite [28] enables ﬁngerprint-input on ubiquitous
surfaces leveraging vibration signals generated by a vibration
motor. They show that vibration signals on a solid surface
can be used to extract unique features that reﬂect the touching
location and force of a user’s ﬁnger pressing. Another line
of research has focused on accelerometer-based trajectory
recovery and activity recognition. Han et al. [21] demonstrate
that the accelerometer on a device can be used to determine
the trajectory and location of the device owner if he/she is
driving in a vehicle. [27], [30], [35] explore how smartphone
accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used to detect and
identify user activities (e.g., walking, jogging, bicycling etc).
III. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this paper, we consider the novel problem of launching
a side-channel attack against smartphone speakers: recognize
and reconstruct the speech signals played by the smartphone
speaker through exploiting the accelerometer on the same
device. Our attack mainly focuses on the Android system due
to its prevalence as the open source mobile operating system
(not taking its variants into account). Please note that the
proposed approach may also be extended to attack iOS since
the maximum sampling rate of the accelerometer in iOS is
also determined by the maximum frequency supported by the
hardware. The reason we prefer to use the accelerometer is
that it is more sensitive to vibrations than the gyroscope. A
comparison between the gyroscope and the accelerometer is
shown in Fig. 3.
A. Threat Model
We assume a victim user with a high-end smartphone.
The smartphone plays a speech signal that contains private
information. In this paper, we focus on private information
made up of numbers, letters, and hot words, such as social
security number, a password, a credit card number, etc. The
smartphone could be on a table or in the user’s hand.
The adversary is a spy app whose objective is to extract
the private information contained in the speech signal. The spy
app continuously collects accelerometer measurements in the
background and tries to extract speech information when the
smartphone speaker plays an audio signal (e.g., during a phone
call or voice message). The detection of the playing activity
can be achieved through checking the high-frequency compo-
nents of the collected accelerometer measurements. Although
the accelerometer can also be affected by daily activities, these
activities rarely affect frequency components above 80Hz (as
will be shown in section IV-C).
For the extraction of the private information, we implement
accelerometer-based speech recognition and speech recon-
struction. Speech recognition converts acceleration signals to

could lead to serious privacy leakage. 2) Location information:
because most navigation apps on current smartphones support
voice guidance, the spy app may track user location through
analyzing the geographical information emitted by the smart-
phone speaker. 3) Music and video preferences: our attacks
can be extended to detect the music or video played by a
smartphone, which could be further analyzed to construct the
user’s listening and watching habits.
The spy app can also eavesdrop on remote callers who
make phone calls or send voice messages to the victim’s
smartphone. For instance, Alice (the victim) makes a phone
call to Bob and request for a credit card number with its
CVV number. Because Bob’s voice will be played by Alice’s
smartphone, the spy app on Alice’s phone will be able to
extract the spoken digits and hot words. In this attack, the
adversary can only eavesdrop on the remote caller since
the voice of the smartphone owner will not be played by
his/her smartphone. Although listening to one side of the
conversation may miss important context information in one
phone call, the adversary can further identify the remote caller
through analyzing the accelerometer measurements (as will be
shown in section VI-B). This allows the adversary to link the
private information extracted across multiple phone calls to a
speciﬁc caller. Once the adversary gathers multiple pieces of
information for a speciﬁc contact (e.g., social security number,
credit card number, phone number, password, etc), the privacy
of that contact will be seriously threatened.
IV. FEASIBILITY STUDY
As mentioned earlier, our core idea is to exploit
the
accelerometer on a smartphone as a zero-permission “mi-
crophone” to eavesdrop on the speaker of the same device.
We now present our experimental validations to demonstrate
the feasibility (severity) of this attack from three aspects:
signiﬁcance, effectiveness and robustness.
We note that all the acceleration signals presented in IV-A
and IV-C are preprocessed with the interpolation approach
proposed in section V. We use this approach to resolve
the problem of unstable sampling interval so that spectrum
analysis can be applied. The resulting acceleration signals have
a ﬁxed sampling rate of 1000 Hz.
A. Signiﬁcance
The core intuition behind this attack is that the accelerom-
eter and speaker of the same device will always be in physical
contact with the same board and locate in very close proximity
to each other,
thereby enabling speech signals to always
produce signiﬁcant responses in accelerometer measurements.
In order to validate this hypothesis, we evaluate the re-
sponses of a smartphone’s accelerometer to its loudspeaker
at different volume levels. Speciﬁcally, we generate a single
tone signal at 200 Hz and play it on a Samsung S8 at 20%,
40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the highest volume supported
by the smartphone. For each setting, we place the smartphone
on a table and play the speech signals for one second. The
accelerometer readings are collected simultaneously through
the AccDataRec APP running in the background.
After recording the acceleration signals, we calculate the
continuous wavelet transform for each axis and generate the

same audio signal. The gyroscope can also response to speech signals emitted
by the speaker on the same device. However, the gyroscope exhibit much
lower audio response than the accelerometer.
text. It allows the adversary to recognize pre-trained numbers,
letters, and hot words from the accelerometer measurements.
Speech reconstruction reconstructs voice signals from accelera-
tion signals. It allows the adversary to double-check the recog-
nition results with human ears. Because the reconstruction
model mainly learns the mapping between signals rather than
the semantic information, it is more generalizable to untrained
words compared with recognition model.
The spy app could be disguised as any app running on the
smartphone since accessing the accelerometer does not require
any permission. Without loss of generality, in this paper, we
collect accelerometer readings (signals) through a third-party
Android application named AccDataRec running in the back-
ground. This application requires zero permission to record
three-axis accelerometer readings along with a timestamp. Ear
speakers and headphones are not considered in this paper as
they can hardly affect the accelerometer.
B. Attack Scenarios
The side channel attack described in this paper allows an
adversary to recognize pre-trained hot words emitted (played)
by a smartphone through analyzing its accelerometer mea-
surements. This attack will affect not only the owner of the
smartphone but also his/her contacts.
For the smartphone owner, the spy app on the smartphone
may steal the following information: 1) Voice memo: the spy
app can catch pre-trained key words when a user listens to
his/her voice memos. Because the voice memo is usually
used to record important private information (e.g., passwords,
phone number, and postcode), exposure of certain key words

corresponding scalograms, which show how the magnitude
of frequency components changes over time. The obtained
scalograms are depicted in Fig. 4, where a brighter region
in the scalogram indicates stronger frequency components.
It can be observed that, starting from the volume level at
20% of the highest volume,
the regions around 200 Hz
are becoming brighter (especially for the z axis), indicating
that the accelerometer successfully captures the voice signals
emitted by the loudspeaker.
To facilitate quantitative comparison between the ac-
celerometer’s response under different settings, we further
quantify the accelerometer’s audio response as:
ARdB = 10log10(
P (S)
P (N )
),
where P is the summed squared magnitude, S and N are two
acceleration signals recorded with and without the presence of
speech signals (played by the speaker). This ARdB is similar
to the deﬁnition of signal to noise ratio (SNR) except that the
signal (S) here is a mixture of the captured speech signal and
noise. In the ideal case where the noise signal remains constant
overtime, an audio response ARdB higher than zero indicates
that the speech signal under investigation has affected the
accelerometer. However, due to the changing nature of noise,
the ARdB calculated from pure noise signals (without any
audio information) could also ﬂuctuate within a small range
around zero. Through studying the pure noise signals from
several smartphone accelerometers, we observe that a threshold
of three can effectively determine if the accelerometer has been
signiﬁcantly affected by speech signals.
Table II lists the audio response calculated from each
speciﬁc setting. It can be observed that the accelerometer’s
audio response varies signiﬁcantly with axis and increases
with higher volume. The sensing units along the x-axis, y-
axis, and z-axis are able to capture speech signals above
60%, 60% and 20% volume level respectively. One important
observation is that, for each speech signal under investigation,
the tested accelerometer always has the strongest response
along the z-axis, followed by the y-axis, and then the x-
axis. In fact, this relationship remains constant regardless of
whether the smartphone is placed on the table or held by
hand. This consistency can be explained by the structure
of the accelerometer’s sensing unit shown in Fig. 2(a). For
each sensing unit, the seismic mass only vibrates along its
sensing axis and therefore is less sensitive to vibration signals
coming from other directions. Because the vibrations rendered

by the smartphone speaker will always transmit through the
motherboard of the smartphone and “hit” the smartphone
accelerometer from the same direction, the accelerometer will
always have the most signiﬁcant audio response along the same
axis. This consistency is important as it helps determine the
portion of the speech information captured from each sensing
axis. In this paper, we refer to the axis with strongest response
as the dominant axis of the smartphone.
B. Effectiveness
it
In the previous literature,
is a common sense that,
the sampling rates of the accelerometer and gyroscope in
Android-powered smartphones cannot exceed 200 Hz [32],
[44], [5]. Since the typical fundamental frequency for an adult
male and adult female respectively lie in the range 85-180Hz
and 165-255Hz [38], [7],
this common sense implies that
the sensors can only pickup a very small range of human
speech in the 85-100 Hz frequency band (according to Nyquist
Theorem) and thus the effectiveness of the attack is limited.
However, as stated in section II-A, if an Android application
selects SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST, the ofﬁcial documents
[2] claim that sensor measurements will be sent
to the
application as fast as possible. In this context, we hypothesize
that this fastest sampling rate for the recent smartphone
models may surpass 200Hz.
To verify the above hypothesis, we test eight smartphones
released in different years and list the actual sampling rates of
the accelerometers in table III. The results conﬁrm that the
actual sampling rate of the accelerometer increases rapidly
with the development of the smartphone models. For high-
end smartphones released after 2017, their accelerometers have
reached sampling frequencies above 400 Hz and therefore
should be able to pickup a considerable range of human
speech. In particular, for Huawei P20 Pro and Mate 20, the
sampling rate of their accelerometers have reached as high as
500 Hz, which allows them to pick up frequency components
up to 250 Hz. Because the highest fundamental frequency for
adult speech is just 255 Hz, these two smartphones almost can
cover the entire fundamental frequency band of adult speech.
The takeaway message is that the threat of motion sensors to

speech privacy has become a serious issue and will continue

C. Robustness
Accelerometers on smartphones are highly sensitive to the
environmental noise. In the adversarial setup under investiga-
tion, the noise may come from following sources: hardware
distortion, acoustic noise, human activities, self-noise and
surface vibration. We look into all
these kinds of noise,
and ﬁnd that most of these noises are either unlikely to
affect accelerometer readings or can be effectively eliminated,
except for the acoustic noise contained in the audio signal
played by the smartphone speaker. The impact of such noise
on the recognition accuracy is evaluated in section VI-C
Hardware distortion is a systematic distortion incurred
by manufacturing imperfection. Small variations in electro-
mechanical structures (e.g., gap between the ﬁxed electrodes
and the ﬂexibility of the seismic mass) result
in slightly
different measurement values [15]. For illustration, we place
four smartphones on the same table and record their responses
