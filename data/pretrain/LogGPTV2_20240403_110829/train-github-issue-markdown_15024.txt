The coverage of managed pointers should be removed from the tutorial and
perhaps replaced with a section mentioned shared ownership (in or after the
ownership/boxes sections) and linking to the tutorial.
The shared ownership tutorial should explain when and why you would use shared
ownership and the characteristics of the various available types.
