Abstract
Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is a packet-based telephony service
seamlessly integrated into the Long Term Evolution (LTE)
standard and deployed by most telecommunication providers
in practice. Due to this widespread use, successful attacks
against VoLTE can affect a large number of users worldwide.
In this work, we introduce REVOLTE, an attack that exploits
an LTE implementation ﬂaw to recover the contents of an
encrypted VoLTE call, hence enabling an adversary to eaves-
drop on phone calls. REVOLTE makes use of a predictable
keystream reuse on the radio layer that allows an adversary to
decrypt a recorded call with minimal resources. Through a
series of preliminary as well as real-world experiments, we
successfully demonstrate the feasibility of REVOLTE and
analyze various factors that critically inﬂuence our attack in
commercial networks. For mitigating the REVOLTE attack,
we propose and discuss short- and long-term countermeasures
deployable by providers and equipment vendors.
1 Introduction
Millions of people worldwide use the latest widely deployed
mobile communication standard LTE daily. Besides high-
speed Internet access, LTE also provides the packet-based
telephony service VoLTE. VoLTE promises low call-setup
times and high-deﬁnition voice quality while being seamlessly
integrated into the standard call procedure. With more than
120 providers worldwide and over 1200 different device types
supporting VoLTE [23], it is an essential part of our commu-
nication infrastructure. At the same time, the use of VoLTE
is fully transparent to the user and improves the call quality
without requiring any further interaction. Consequently, any
practical vulnerability in the VoLTE standard has far-reaching
consequences for users all over the world, without them even
realizing that they may be affected.
LTE not only improves the performance of prior mobile
network generations, but it also deﬁnes a series of fundamen-
tal security aims to protect further the sensitive information
of phone calls, web browsing, etc. One crucial aspect of these
security aims is providing data conﬁdentiality [8] for all voice
calls, which protects LTE communication from eavesdrop-
ping. This is achieved by implementing publicly reviewed
encryption algorithms like AES that protect the radio-layer
transmission. In addition, VoLTE can establish an additional
layer of security that further protects all signaling messages
(IPsec tunnel) and voice data (SRTP). We will later see how
these additional security features must be considered in the
design of our attack. Breaking these protection mechanisms
and thus the data conﬁdentiality of LTE, allows us to recover
the information of an arbitrary phone call. In a setting where
the underlying mobile network generation promises strong
security aims, this might reveal highly sensitive information
that was assumed to be protected.
While prior work demonstrates that the aims of location and
identity privacy [13,43] and an attacker can break the integrity
of user data [38], a technical report by Raza and Lu [36]
recently indicated that the data conﬁdentiality of LTE might
contain a fundamental ﬂaw. By jamming particular messages
and reinstalling a key, the authors introduce a concept that
theoretically allows eavesdropping on a VoLTE connection.
Although their work presents the foundation for breaking
the essential security aim—data conﬁdentiality—of the LTE
communication standard, their work only covers a theoretical
evaluation of the attack vector. It lacks any evidence that
the concept is actually feasible in a real-world setup and at a
sufﬁciently large scale.
In this work, we build upon the concept of key reinstal-
lation and break the data conﬁdentiality aim of LTE in a
commercial network setup. This attack vector is the starting
point for REVOLTE: An attack concept that uses a passive
downlink sniffer instead of active jamming, and provides in-
sights on numerous adjustments to the technical requirements
and challenges of a real-world implementation of the attack.
REVOLTE is a layer-two attack that allows us to Reuse En-
crypted VoLTE trafﬁc to eavesdrop on an encrypted voice call.
Keystream reuse can occur when two calls are made within
one radio connection.

Consequently, an attacker can decrypt the ﬁrst call when
she instantly calls the victim after the ﬁrst call ended. Even
though the speciﬁcation states that the network is in charge of
preventing such key reuse, we ﬁnd multiple networks reusing
the same keystream for subsequent calls. In addition to prov-
ing the general feasibility in commercial networks, we further
provide an extensive experimental evaluation of all technical
and operational requirements that allows us to understand the
attack vector better.
With millions of users potentially being at risk, we argue
that it is crucial to analyze LTE key reuse attacks beyond their
theoretical concept. By developing a better understanding of
the open attack vectors in our current mobile network genera-
tions, we can avoid the same issues in the speciﬁcation and
implementation of upcoming standards. With that said, we
can ﬁnd the same attack vector in the upcoming 5G networks.
Therefore, we additionally take a defensive perspective to
analyze and discuss short- and long-term countermeasure con-
cepts that protect from or circumvent the threat of REVOLTE.
In summary, our contributions are as follows:
• Attack with Real-World Impact. We
analyze
keystream reuse under real-world considerations and
present a practical attack called REVOLTE. REVOLTE
completely breaks the conﬁdentiality aim of LTE and
allows an attacker to eavesdrop phone calls.
• Preliminary and Real-World Experiments. We con-
duct several preliminary experiments to evaluate the var-
ious conditions that inﬂuence REVOLTE. In particular,
we conduct real-world experiments with three operators
on keystream reuse and ﬁnd two of them vulnerable.
Further, we assess the use of so-called comfort noise,
transcoding, and robust header compression.
• Discussion of Countermeasures. Our experimental
evaluation of REVOLTE provides clear evidence that
the conﬁdentiality aim of LTE is at risk. We thoroughly
discuss potential mitigations that can be deployed by
the providers and elaborate on how users can protect
themselves.
Disclosure Process. The keystream reuse vulnerability ex-
ploited by REVOLTE is an implementation ﬂaw and affects
a large number of deployments. Following the guidelines
of responsible disclosure, we have reported the vulnerability
via the GSMA CVD program (CVD-2019-0030) and actively
work together to ﬁx the problem.
2 Preliminaries
In this section, we introduce the basics of LTE networks with a
focus on security establishment and encryption features. Fur-
thermore, we take a closer look at the technical background
of the VoLTE standard.
Figure 1: LTE network with IMS
2.1 LTE and IMS Network
When establishing a VoLTE connection with an LTE network,
a series of different components assures the communication
between a user’s device and the core network components (cf.
Figure 1). In the following, we introduce all entities that are
relevant in the context of the proposed attack.
User Equipment (UE). The UE is the user’s endpoint of the
connection (e.g., a smartphone) and provides the technical
functionality for accessing the LTE network. It implements
the VoLTE stack that allows to access VoLTE services at the
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). On the second layer of the
network stack, the radio layer, the UE connects to one of
the base stations in the current radio cell. On the third layer,
the UE further executes the authentication and key agreement
procedure with the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and IMS. In
our attack, we eavesdrop the VoLTE call for the victim’s UE.
Evolved NodeB (eNodeB). eNodeBs are the base stations in
an LTE network and are responsible for controlled resource
allocation for all UEs in their cell. Furthermore, an eNodeB
applies encryption to user and control plane data and can use
additional compression for user plane packets. In this work,
we locate a sniffer in the range of the eNodeB and thus can
receive all frames.
EPC. The EPC is the LTE core network and responsible for
the authentication and key agreement, and mobility manage-
ment. The EPC also forwards user plane trafﬁc to the correct
packet data network, e. g., the Internet in case of web brows-
ing. In the case of a VoLTE call, the packet data network is
the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).
IMS. The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) is the IP-based
telephone service for LTE and consists of different sub-
components. One of the critical functions is the Proxy Call
Session Control Function (P-CSCF) that manages the incom-
ing and outgoing VoLTE calls.
2.2 VoLTE
The VoLTE speciﬁcation allows using the packet-based LTE
network and IP protocols to establish voice and media calls.
To this end, VoLTE uses modiﬁed Internet domain protocols:
the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to signal the call ﬂow, the
Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) to transport the actual
voice data, and the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) to control

crypt the encrypted payload of the RTP packets. In a VoLTE
setting, these protocol messages are treated as user data with
special transmission requirements. Two important character-
istics, the multimedia codecs and robust header compression,
inﬂuence the way data is transmitted in a VoLTE call. Fur-
thermore, the concept of data bearers allows matching the
speciﬁc transmission requirements of VoLTE calls.
2.2.1 Codecs and Comfort Noise
Multimedia codecs help to transform signals between differ-
ent representations and are a core component for mobile com-
munication. The technical characteristics of a codec depend
on its main goal and can either optimize the data consump-
tion or the perceived call quality (maximizing both would be
optimal but unrealistic). Once translated into the target repre-
sentation, VoLTE uses RTP to transmit data in packets. There
are three possible codec options for a VoLTE call: Enhanced
Voice Services (EVS), Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR), and
Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband (AMR-WB).
All three codecs are optimized to save bitrate in periods
where one calling partner is silent. In these periods, comfort
noise is generated based on a transmitted seed sent by the
silent calling partner. Comfort noise saves bitrate as the seed
is smaller and transmitted on a lower frequency. For example,
the AMR-WB codec encodes the seed of the comfort noise
with 40 bit every 160 ms. Actual voice is encoded with 477 bit
every 20 ms in the high-quality mode (23.85 kbit/s) [5].
Transcoding converts the voice data with a particular codec
sent by one calling partner into another codec that is sent to
the other calling partner. Although this results in the same
audio content (i. e., what the calling partner hears), it destroys
the bit pattern of the encoded voice data. Transcoding can
happen when the call is routed via an IP exchange (IPX) or
when radio-layer problems enforce a downsampling.
2.2.2 Robust Header Compression
Robust Header Compression (ROHC) is a technique to save
transmission bits in the headers of IP, TCP, UDP, and RTP
packets, and is primarily used in the context of wireless trans-
missions with high bit-error rates. The compression saves
bandwidth by removing redundancies from similarities in
packet headers of the same connection endpoints. Further-
more, compression becomes possible through the possibility
of predicting parts of the information across protocols.
The eNodeB can activate ROHC for radio transmissions
with different proﬁles that deﬁne the compressed data of the IP
packet. In the context of VoLTE, two proﬁles are commonly
used: Proﬁle 1 compresses RTP, UDP, and IP headers and only
transmits the payload of the RTP data with a ROHC small
header. Proﬁle 2 compresses UDP and IP headers and only
carries the UDP payload again with a small ROHC header.

purpose, and radio bearer IDs.

The REVOLTE attack extracts a keystream from the sniffed
radio packet and sent plaintext. The ROHC inﬂuences the
transmitted radio packets and is thus vital to consider a possi-
ble compression for the keystream computation.
2.2.3 Radio Connection and Radio Data Bearers
An active radio connection transports data over the air be-
tween the UE and the eNodeB. After reaching the threshold
of an inactivity timer, the eNodeB switches an active connec-
tion into the idle mode to save resources. When reactivating
the radio connection, both parties derive a new key which
is used for encrypting the data. For the REVOLTE attack,
the two subsequent calls must take place within one radio
connection, as only then the same encryption key is reused.
Part of the active radio connection are multiple radio bear-
ers, which represent a logical link between the UE and the
eNodeB and match certain transmission requirements. In
case of a VoLTE-capable UE, three radio data bearers are
required to provide Internet access and additional function-
ality for VoLTE voice calls. Table 1 provides an exemplary
overview of the bearers used for a radio connection. The de-
fault bearer (DRB1) transmits the Internet data. A second data
bearer (DRB2) is used for the SIP signaling trafﬁc sent to the
IMS. In case of a phone call, a third (dedicated) data bearer
transports the voice trafﬁc. This bearer is only established
for the phone call and is immediately removed after the call.
The eNodeB selects the used bearer ID and, thus, depends on
the implementation. REVOLTE targets the dedicated voice
bearer and exploits the fact that the same bearer ID (DRB3)
is reused for a second call within the same radio connection.
2.3 LTE Security
The LTE security aims include mutual authentication and
data conﬁdentially. A provably secure Authentication and
Key Agreement (AKA) achieves the ﬁrst aim on layer three
(Non-Access Stratum (NAS)) between the EPC and UE. For
this work, we focus on the radio-layer encryption, as it is
crucial to understand the attack vector of REVOLTE.
2.3.1 Radio Layer Encryption
Radio-layer encryption protects all user and control plane
data transmitted on the connection between the UE and the

2.4 VoLTE Security
Besides the LTE security measures, VoLTE itself implements
further security measures on layers three and four. While the
encryption of user plane data is optional but recommended on
layer two, the additional VoLTE security measures on higher
layers of the protocol stack are optional and depend on the
network conﬁguration of a speciﬁc country. In particular, we
discuss an additional AKA with the IMS, the IPsec protection
of SIP messages, and the protection of RTP trafﬁc.
2.4.1 Additional AKA
When the UE connects to the IMS via the SIP register proce-
dure, both parties perform an additional AKA. Again, this
AKA establishes mutual authentication and a key based on
the shared key on the SIM card. The established key can pro-
tect SIP messages with an IPsec tunnel that can be operated in
two modes: Authentication Header (AH) ensures the authen-
tication and integrity of the IP payload. The Encapsulating
Security Payload (ESP) additionally encrypts the IP payload.
