In previous studies, to assess putative antagonist of GPCR by ELISA
or radioisotope labeling, increased basal cAMP level is required by
using the agonist of adenylate cyclase (AC) such as forskolin due to
relatively low AC activity and cAMP level (Seamon et al., 1981).
However, in turn, the exogenous addition of forskolin would result in
increased uncertainties and errors (Gilissen et al., 2015; Hill et al.,
2010). The application of dual-luciferase reporter method in our study
could eﬀectively overcome these obstacles. Interestingly, we found that
although the basal cAMP level of pMC5R-F339A was unchanged com-
pared with the signiﬁcantly increased pMC5R-H342A, a dose-depen-
dent decrease signal caused by AgRP in pMC5R-F339A was also de-
tected. These results demonstrated that high basal activity of receptors
is not suﬃcient for the identiﬁcation of antagonists.
3.4. pERK1/2 levels of four MC5Rs and their mutants with two ligands
To further evaluate the signaling properties of c/d/g/pMC5R and
their mutants, we measured the eﬃcacy of two ligands in mitogen-ac-
tivated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling (Johnson and Lapadat, 2002;
Robinson and Cobb, 1997). During four types of MAPK cascade path-
ways, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are
the most widely reported, which play an important role in normal
physiological activities of human and animals (Kehat et al., 2011; Kehat
and Molkentin, 2010). Previous studies showed that the hMC5R would
activate the PKA signaling pathway and increase the phosphorylation
level of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells with the agonists (Rodrigues et al.,
2009). Despite of these eﬀorts, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 in
c/d/g/pMC5R and their mutants in the absence or presence of ligands
are still unknown.
After preliminary experiments, we chose 5 min as the stimulation
duration with 50 nmol/L NDP-MSH or AgRP for our next test due to a
better performance. We ﬁrst compared the basal phosphorylation level
of ERK1/2 between wide type and mutants in the absence of ligand
