#### 3.3. Evaluation of Putative Antagonists Using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay

In previous studies, the assessment of putative GPCR antagonists has often relied on ELISA or radioisotope labeling techniques, which require the use of an agonist such as forskolin to increase basal cAMP levels due to the relatively low activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) and cAMP levels (Seamon et al., 1981). However, the exogenous addition of forskolin can introduce increased uncertainties and errors (Gilissen et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2010). Our study employed the dual-luciferase reporter method, which effectively overcame these challenges. Interestingly, we observed that while the basal cAMP level in pMC5R-F339A remained unchanged compared to the significantly increased level in pMC5R-H342A, a dose-dependent decrease in signal caused by AgRP was detected in pMC5R-F339A. These findings suggest that high basal receptor activity alone is not sufficient for the identification of antagonists.

#### 3.4. Phosphorylation Levels of ERK1/2 in MC5Rs and Their Mutants with Two Ligands

To further evaluate the signaling properties of c/d/g/pMC5R and their mutants, we measured the efficacy of two ligands in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway (Johnson and Lapadat, 2002; Robinson and Cobb, 1997). Among the various MAPK cascade pathways, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) are the most widely studied and play a crucial role in normal physiological activities in both humans and animals (Kehat et al., 2011; Kehat and Molkentin, 2010). Previous research has shown that hMC5R activates the PKA signaling pathway and increases the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in HEK293 cells when stimulated with agonists (Rodrigues et al., 2009). Despite this, the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 in c/d/g/pMC5R and their mutants, both in the absence and presence of ligands, remain unexplored.

After preliminary experiments, we selected a stimulation duration of 5 minutes with 50 nmol/L NDP-MSH or AgRP, as this provided the best performance. We first compared the basal phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 between wild-type and mutant receptors in the absence of ligands.
