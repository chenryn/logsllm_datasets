INCIDENT HANDLING STEPS
6 STEPS ARE DEFINED TO HANDLE SECURITY INCIDENTS
1. Preparation: get ready to handle the incident
2. Identification: detect the incident
3. Containment: limit the impact of the incident
4. Remediation: remove the threat
5. Recovery: recover to a normal stage
6. Lessons learned: draw up and improve the process
IRM provides detailed information for each stepof the incident response process.The steps
come from NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide.
