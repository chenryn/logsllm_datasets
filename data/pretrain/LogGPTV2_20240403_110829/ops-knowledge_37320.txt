User: Not sure if anyone has run into this, but I'll take suggestions for troubleshooting and/or alternative methods.
I have a Windows 2008 server on which I am running several scheduled tasks.  One of those tasks is a python script that uses pscp to log into a linux box, checks for new files and if there is anything new, copies them down to a local directory on the C: drive.  I've put some logging into the script at key points as well and I'm using logging.basicConfig(level=DEBUG).  
I built the command using a variable, command = 'pscp -pw xxxx name@ip:/ c:\local_dir' and then I use subprocess.call(command) to execute the command.
Now here's the weird part.  If I run the script manually from the command line, it works fine.  New files are downloaded and processed.  However, if the Task Scheduler runs the script, no new files are downloaded.  The script is running under the same user, but yet yields different results.
According to the log files created by the script and on the linux box, the script successfully logs into the linux box.  However, no files are downloaded despite there being new files.  Again, when I run it via the command line, files are downloaded.
Any ideas? suggestions, alternative methods? 
Thanks.
Assistant: Brad's answer is right. Subprocess needs the shell context to work and the task manager can launch python without that. Another way to do it is to make a batch file that is launched by the task scheduler that calls python c:\path\to\script.py etc. The only difference to this is that if you run into a script that has a call to os.getcwd() you will always get the root where the script is but you get something else when you make the call to cmd from task scheduler.
