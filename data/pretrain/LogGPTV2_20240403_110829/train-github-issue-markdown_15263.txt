I am attempting to build the Atom editor from source on my Ubuntu 14.04 ARMHF machine, but I have encountered some issues. Specifically, the build process halts when it tries to download pre-built binaries for the ARM architecture, which do not yet exist. Here are the versions of Node and npm that I am using:

- Node: v0.10.32
- npm: v1.4.28

The build process proceeds as follows:
- Installing build modules...
- Installing apm...
- Installing modules ✓
- Deduping modules ✓
- Running "download-atom-shell" task
- **Error:** Cannot find `atom-shell-v0.17.1-linux-arm.zip` in atom-shell v0.17.1 release
- **Result:** Aborted due to warnings.

To resolve this, I attempted to build the `atom-shell` component manually. However, I encountered another issue while running the `script/bootstrap.py` script. The command `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the `vendor/node` directory failed with the following error:

```
fatal: reference is not a tree: a80a10c6a1f2c668d90eda4e2c9aab38e4dcd4a2
Unable to checkout 'a80a10c6a1f2c668d90eda4e2c9aab38e4dcd4a2' in submodule path 'vendor/node'
Traceback (most recent call last):

    raise e
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['git', 'submodule', 'update', '--init', '--recursive']' returned non-zero exit status 1
```

Can anyone provide guidance on how to resolve these issues?
