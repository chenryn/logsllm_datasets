**CANSPY: A Platform for Auditing CAN Devices**

**Authors:**
- Arnaud Lebrun
- Jonathan-Christofer Demay

---

### **Auditing Conventional IT Systems**

- **Penetration Testing:** A form of security audit that assesses the risks of intrusion through actual tests, rather than a review process.
  - **Approach:** The "black-box" method, which simulates the perspective of a real attacker.
  - **Benefits:**
    - Provides a relevant evaluation of impact and exploitability.
  - **Limitations:**
    - Limited time and resources.
    - Ethical constraints.
  - **Countermeasure:** The "grey-box" approach, which provides more context and information to the tester.

---

### **The CISOâ€™s Dilemma**

- **Challenges:**
  - Broad scope of responsibility.
  - Continuous changes in the threat landscape.
  - Major security threats with the potential for substantial damages.
  - Limited budget.
- **Response:**
  - Relying on penetration testing.
  - Embracing the "grey-box" approach.
  - Prioritizing risk analysis.
  - Dividing perimeters accordingly.

---

### **Car Manufacturers and Cyber-Security**

- **Trend:**
  - Car manufacturers are increasingly incorporating cyber-security alongside conventional safety measures.
- **Approach:**
  - For each vehicle:
    - Conduct risk analysis.
    - Prioritize Electronic Control Units (ECUs).
    - Perform targeted penetration tests.
    - Implement corrective actions.
  - Some ECUs may be common across multiple vehicles, making corrective actions challenging.

---

### **Entry Points for Attacks**

- **Consumer-Grade Connectivity:**
  - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB.
  - Nothing new here.
- **Infotainment and Navigation:**
  - Mobile broadband connectivity using conventional protocols (TCP, HTTP, etc.).
  - Setting up an IMSI catcher.
  - Again, nothing new here.
- **CAN Attacks:**
  - Bypassing CAN bus segmentation (architecture-dependent).
  - Reverse-engineering higher-layer protocols.
  - Breaking the Security Access challenge (ISO 14229).

---

### **CAN Architectures**

- **Single Bus:**
  - Less common today due to congestion issues.
- **Multiple Separate Buses:**
  - Some ECUs need to be connected to multiple buses, which can be used to bypass segmentation.
- **Multiple Interconnected Buses:**
  - A gateway routes frames between CAN buses, considering the vehicle's state and both safety and cyber-security.

---

### **Crafting CAN Attacks**

- **Attack Vectors:**
  - Misuse of intrinsic capabilities (e.g., remote diagnostic tools).
  - Exploiting higher-level parsing vulnerabilities.
  - Breaking the Security Access challenge.
- **Process:**
  - Unsolder EEPROM or identify debug interfaces (JTAG/BDM, UART/WDBRPC).
  - Extract firmware.
  - Reverse-engineer the components.
  - Craft and execute attacks.

---

### **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**

- **Client-Server Model:**
  - Insert yourself between the client and server.
  - Do not alter traffic until something interesting is detected.
  - Drop, alter, or replay traffic as needed.
  - Finalize with targeted reverse-engineering.
- **CAN Bus:**
  - Physically cut the bus and insert yourself between the split parts.
  - Forward traffic between the split parts.
- **Options:**
  - Emulate the car from the audited device's perspective.
  - Use an integration bench provided by the car manufacturer.

---

### **Existing Tools and Limitations**

- **Interface:**
  - Only one interface to connect to CAN buses.
  - Bridging two devices can introduce high latency.
- **Timing Constraints:**
  - CAN was designed for deterministic timing.
  - Low-end FTDI chips (UART over USB at 115,200 bauds) are insufficient for CAN speeds (up to 1 Mbit/s).
- **OBD-II:**
  - Operates at 250 or 500 kbit/s.
- **Framework:**
  - Lack of a mature and powerful framework.
  - Scapy compatibility is limited.
  - Higher-layers reverse-engineering efforts are fragmented.

- **STM32F4DISCOVERY Board:**
  - 168 MHz 32-bit ARM Cortex M4.
  - Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) at $20.
- **STM32F4DIS-BB Extension Board:**
  - RS232 interface.
  - Ethernet port.
  - SD card drive.

### **CAN over Ethernet**

- **SocketCAN Format:**
  - Ethertype 0x88b5.
  - Different MAC addresses.
  - Acknowledgments.
- **Wireshark Integration:**
  - Lua script for dissecting SocketCAN packets.

```lua
class SocketCAN(Packet):
  name = "SocketCAN"
  fields_desc = [
    BitEnumField("EFF", 0, 1, {0:"Disabled", 1:"Enabled"}),
    BitEnumField("RTR", 0, 1, {0:"Disabled", 1:"Enabled"}),
    BitEnumField("ERR", 0, 1, {0:"Disabled", 1:"Enabled"}),
    XBitField("id", 1, 29),
    FieldLenField("dlc", None, length_of="data", fmt="B"),
    ByteField("__pad", 0),
    ByteField("__res0", 0),
    ByteField("__res1", 0),
    StrLenField("data", "", length_from = lambda pkt: pkt.dlc),
  ]
  def extract_padding(self, p):
    return "",p
bind_layers(Ether, SocketCAN, type=0x88b5)
```

### **OBD-II Use Case**

- **Setup:**
  - No need to physically cut anything.
  - Use a Goodthopter-compatible OBDII-to-DB9 cable.
  - Build a female counterpart ($10 worth of components).
  - Set up the DUAL-CAN extension properly.
- **Applications:**
  - Professional/consumer car diagnostic tools.
  - Usage-based policies from insurance companies.
  - Air-pollution control by law enforcement.
  - Exposes sensitive networks/hosts.

**Note:** This setup should be used responsibly and ethically.
