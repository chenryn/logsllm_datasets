**ATT&CK ID:** T1562.006  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Indicator Blocking

An adversary may attempt to block the collection and analysis of indicators or events that are typically captured by host-based sensors. This can be achieved by maliciously redirecting or disabling these sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), through the manipulation of settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry. These settings may be stored in configuration files and/or the Windows Registry, and can also be accessed and modified using administrative utilities like PowerShell or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
