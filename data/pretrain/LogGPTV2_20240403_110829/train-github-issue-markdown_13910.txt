`Mismatch between outfeed output buffer shape u32[2]{0} and outfeed source
buffer shape f32[]`
All test cases seem to fail this way. It's a little hard to tell because after
a few test cases run and fail with this, the test will just hang until you
kill it (probably because computations are blocked waiting for infeed).
I haven't dug into this at all, but for now I'm planning to disable all of
host_callback_test on multi-GPU platforms in order to make our test suite
runnable on multi-GPU (since right now it hangs).
