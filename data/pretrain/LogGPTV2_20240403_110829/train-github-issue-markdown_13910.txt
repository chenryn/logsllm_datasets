When running the command `~/jax$ python3 tests/host_callback_test.py`, the following error occurs:

```
[ RUN      ] CallJaxTest.test_jax_grad
2021-04-15 00:16:53.333864: E external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/compiler/xla/status_macros.cc:56] Internal: RET_CHECK failure (external/org_tensorflow/tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/gpu/outfeed_thunk.cc:80) ShapeUtil::Equal(source_slices_[index].shape, output_shape) Mismatch between outfeed output buffer shape u32[2]{0} and outfeed source buffer shape f32[]
```

The specific error message is:
```
Mismatch between outfeed output buffer shape u32[2]{0} and outfeed source buffer shape f32[]
```

All test cases appear to fail in this manner. After a few test cases run and fail, the test suite hangs, likely because computations are blocked while waiting for infeed.

I have not yet investigated the root cause of this issue. As a temporary solution, I plan to disable all `host_callback_test` tests on multi-GPU platforms to ensure that our test suite can run without hanging.
