I try to include a common f77 block from legacy code.
some calculations in the conversion go wrong.
I have in my common block lines
          implicit real*8 (a-h,o-z)
          parameter ( nvar  = 3       )
          parameter ( jmz    = 1983 )
          common scmt(3*(jmz+1)), dbuf(nvar*(nvar+1) * (jmz+2))
resulting an a comlilation error
    /tmp/tmpcpniavle/src.linux-x86_64-3.4/_keplermodule.c:1386:22: error: ânvarâ undeclared here (not in a function)
       {"dbuf",1,{{5955 * nvar + 5955}},NPY_DOUBLE},
it seems a bad line is generated and f2py does not resolve multiple
occurrences (nvar) of the same parameter/variable in an expression? at least
inside sufficiently complex expressions?
If I define a parameter with nvar*(nvar+1) and use that new parameter, things
work, but maybe if you get a chance to fix this fluke as well, that would be
nice. (or let me me know in what function for crackfortran even to look...)
