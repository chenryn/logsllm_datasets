**What happened** :
Document doc/design/versioning.md describes official branches to be used in
Kubernetes project repositories: "master", "release-X.Y", "release-X.Y.Z".  
At the moment, we have in kubernetes/kubernetes repository bunch of branches
that are violating those naming conventions and most of them seems to be
accidental pushes by people who has direct push rights to the repository. I
think it is needed to be cleaned up from repository and potentially automatic
check to be implemented to automatically clean-up them on appearance.
