attack edges are placed either arbitrarily [32, 31, 27, 21] or
based on eigenvector centrality [11]6.
With the above initial overlay in place, a selective heuris-
tic would enable each node v to initiate a 2-hop link request
to every node y in its ranked list of k 2-hop neighbors. Recall
that the initiation of a link request from v does not neces-
sarily imply reciprocation from y. Only if y were to have v
in its ranked list of k 2-hop neighbors as well, the link (v, y)
would be created. We set k = 100 for each selective heuris-
tic. In contrast, the Two-Hop heuristic would add links from
each node to all its 2-hop neighbors.
6For clarity, we do not show the result of eigenvector centrality.

We now apply churn model to the system. We consider
an unavailability of c = 0.8, implying that 80% of all hon-
est nodes are considered oﬄine. The remaining 20% of all
honest nodes that are considered online are selected pro-
portional to the exponent γ of their degrees in the honest
region. We set a default value γ = 0.5, implying a small
bias toward (honest) nodes with higher degrees to be online
compared to the (honest) ones with lower degrees. In each
experiment, we consider all the Sybil nodes to be online all
the time. This would result in skewed distribution of hon-
est and Sybil nodes online at any given instance (Fig. 1(b)).
When the unavailability is c = 0.8, the system would contain
0.2n honest nodes and n Sybil nodes online at that instance.
Finally, we measure the system robustness with the above
metrics. Disconnection probability is computed as the ratio
of the number of online honest nodes in the LCC of the
online honest region to the total number of online honest
nodes. Escape probability is computed as the average of the
fraction of 1000 uniform random walks of length c ∗ log(n)
from each of 500 seeds in the LCC of the online honest region
escaping into the Sybil region. We report the results of both
the metrics averaged over 50 runs.
6.2 Impact of Various Parameters
With the above experimental setup, we examine how vary-
ing individual parameters aﬀects the system in terms of net-
work connectivity (disconnection probability) and attack re-
silience (escape probability).
Attack Edges. Figure 5 shows the impact of 1-hop at-
tack edges on the system. We observe that increasing 1-hop
attack edges has little impact on the connectivity of hon-
est nodes in the overlay network, while severely degrading
the security of random walks originating in the honest re-
gion.
In terms of disconnection probability, the Two-Hop
heuristic fares the best while the One-Hop heuristic fares the
worst. Note that our proposed heuristic (MinEC) has a com-
parable performance to the Two-Hop heuristic in all three
datasets. In terms of escape probability, the One-Hop and
