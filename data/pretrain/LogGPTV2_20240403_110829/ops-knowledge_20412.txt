User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I determine the size of my SQL Server database? Basic: what's the size on disk of my MS SQL Server DB?
More: can I quickly see where the data is? i.e. which tables, logs, etc

Assistant: You'll probably want to start with the sp_spaceused command.

For example:

sp_spaceused
Returns information about the total size of the database

sp_spaceused 'MyTable'
Returns information about the size of MyTable

Read the docs for all the things you can get information about. You can also use the sp_msforeachtable command to run sp_spaceused against all tables at once.

Edit: Be aware the command sometimes returns multiple datasets, each set containing a different chunk of stats.
