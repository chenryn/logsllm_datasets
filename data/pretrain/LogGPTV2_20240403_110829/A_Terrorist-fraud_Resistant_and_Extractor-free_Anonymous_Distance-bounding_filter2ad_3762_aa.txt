ABSTRACT
Distance-bounding protocols have been introduced to thwart
relay attacks against contactless authentication protocols.
In this context, veriﬁers have to authenticate the creden-
tials of untrusted provers. Unfortunately, these protocols
are themselves subject to complex threats such as terrorist-
fraud attacks, in which a malicious prover helps an accom-
plice to authenticate. Provably guaranteeing the resistance
of distance-bounding protocols to these attacks is complex.
The classical solutions assume that rational provers want to
protect their long-term authentication credentials, even with
respect to their accomplices. Thus, terrorist-fraud resistant
protocols generally rely on artiﬁcial extraction mechanisms,
ensuring that an accomplice can retrieve the credential of
his partnering prover, if he is able to authenticate.
We propose a novel approach to obtain provable terrorist-
fraud resistant protocols that does not rely on an accom-
plice being able to extract any long-term key. Instead, we
simply assume that he can replay the information received
from the prover. Thus, rational provers should refuse to
cooperate with third parties if they can impersonate them
freely afterwards. We introduce a generic construction for
provably secure distance-bounding protocols, and give three
instances of this construction: (1) an eﬃcient symmetric-key
protocol, (2) a public-key protocol protecting the identities
of provers against external eavesdroppers, and ﬁnally (3) a
fully anonymous protocol protecting the identities of provers
even against malicious veriﬁers that try to proﬁle them.

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, contactless communications have become
ubiquitous. They are used in access control cards, electronic
passports, payment systems, and numerous other applica-
tions, which often require some form of authentication. In
authentication protocols, the device to authenticate is typ-
ically an RFID tag, a contactless card or more and more
frequently an NFC-enabled smartphone, acting as a prover.
Before accessing some resources, this device has to authen-
ticate to a reader, which plays the role of a veriﬁer.
A crucial concern for contactless communications are re-
lay attacks, in which an adversary forwards the communica-
tions between a prover and a veriﬁer to authenticate [15, 4].
These attacks cannot be prevented by cryptographic tools
and mechanisms ensuring the physical proximity between
a veriﬁer and a prover must be used. Distance-bounding
(DB) protocols [10] have been proposed to allow the veriﬁer
to estimate an upper bound on his distance to the prover
by measuring the time-of-ﬂight of short challenge-response
messages (or rounds) exchanged during time-critical phases.
At the end of such a protocol, the veriﬁer should be able to
determine if the prover is legitimate and in his vicinity.
A typical scenario for contactless authentication devices
is a public transportation system in which users authenti-
cate to access buses or subway stations through their NFC-
enabled smartphones. The transportation company will de-
ploy controls to prevent misuses of its system but a legit-
imate user might be tempted to help a friend to use his
credentials illegally for a single trip, which is known as a
terrorist fraud (TF). Nevertheless, this user might not ac-
cept that his friend uses them afterwards as the original user
may get caught and be accountable. Note that this attack
targets the transportation company. Another threat against
DB protocols, known as a maﬁa fraud (MF), is a fraudster
using the presence of a legitimate user to authenticate. This
attack targets the transportation company as well as the end
user as he may have to pay for this extra fare. Both types of
attacks are typical relay attacks against contactless authen-
tication protocols. Another crucial aspect for such a system
is the protection of user privacy. Indeed, most users would
not accept that their whereabouts can be tracked down by
other users or by the transportation company due the wealth
of personal information that can be inferred from such data.
800Another simple scenario could be the access to a restricted
building. In this case, third parties may want to enter (MF
attacks), or legitimate workers may want to help friends to
access the building (TF attacks). However, the veriﬁer is
not directly a threat against the privacy of the workers.
In this paper, we propose a new approach for developing
provably secure DB protocols resisting to all classical threats
against such protocols. Its novelty relies on the fact that a
prover can control the responses to the time-critical chal-
lenges and still prove his proximity. This is particularly ap-
propriate for coping with terrorist-fraud attacks, since these
responses can be reused by malicious parties, only if they
have been helped by the prover beforehand. Moreover, this
approach is more ﬂexible than traditional countermeasures
to TF attacks, which rely on extraction mechanisms (e.g.,
zero-knowledge proofs, secret-sharing schemes or fuzzy ex-
tractors). In particular, these mechanisms are more complex
than the ones used in this paper and the DB protocols based
on them require more elaborated proofs. Furthermore, these
protocols rely on long-term secret keys, which expose the
privacy and the anonymity of provers.
Note that the TF-resistance property is a concept that
is diﬃcult to formalize and numerous attempts have been
made [16, 7, 17, 26]. Far from claiming that our approach
is the only viable alternative to achieving TF-resistance, it
expands the fundamental understanding of the problem and
how to counter it in practice. Eventually, the best approach
will emerge from all these attempts. Our main contributions
can be summarized as follows.
Novel approach. Our main contribution is to propose
a new approach for provable TF resistance in which the
prover selects unilaterally the binary responses used during
the time-critical challenge-response phases.
If a malicious
prover gives this information to his accomplice, the accom-
plice can then adapt and replay successfully the information
received during a new session. Since a rational prover is
not willing to allow an accomplice to impersonate him at
will, he will not attempt any TF attack in the ﬁrst place.
As a consequence, we obtain an intuitive TF resistance proof
without relying on any artiﬁcial extraction mechanism. Sur-
prisingly, this idea has not been considered in the literature
before. As shown in this paper, it can be used to design
protocols achieving the simulation-based TF resistance no-
tion [16], which is a stronger notion than the ones used for
most existing TF-resistant protocols.
Fortunately, even if the prover is responsible for selecting
the response vectors, this impacts only slightly the other se-
curity properties of our protocols. Intuitively, relaxing the
freshness of the information and allowing the replay of some
authenticated data may introduce a way for an attacker to
impersonate a legitimate prover.
In our context, such an
attack is typically referred to as a MF attack. Fortunately,
this attack would be successful only if the attacker could be
able to guess half of his missing responses to the veriﬁer’s
challenges. This explains why the MF-resistance of our so-
lution is not as strong as the best available solutions.
Generic construction. Our second contribution is the pro-
tocol TREAD (for Terrorist-fraud Resistant and Extractor-
free Anonymous Distance-bounding), which is a generic con-
struction implementing the proposed approach. It can be in-
stantiated in many ways including a more eﬃcient symmetric-
key protocol, a public-key protocol protecting the privacy of
provers in the presence of external eavesdroppers, and a pro-
tocol based on group signatures protecting the anonymity
of provers even against malicious veriﬁers trying to pro-
ﬁle provers. The latter one can be used for instance in the
public transportation scenario, whilst the ﬁrst two are more
adapted to the scenario of the restricted-access building.
Extension of DFKO. The ﬁnal contribution is to extend
the DFKO framework [16] to deal with distance-hijacking
(DH) attacks [14], in which a malicious prover tries to fool a
veriﬁer, by taking advantage of nearby honest provers. This
provides a framework to deal with all the potential attacks
against DB protocols and the security of TREAD is proven
in this extended framework.
Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of our results and
well-known solutions existing in the literature. These results
are grouped into three categories: best unproved protocols,
best formally-proven protocols and best privacy-preserving
formally-proven protocols.
Table 1: Summary of existing solutions. TF de-
notes the terrorist-fraud resistance. The probabil-
ities of successful maﬁa-fraud (MF) and distance-
fraud (DF) attacks depend on the number n of time-
critical rounds. P and A respectively denote privacy
with respect to an eavesdropper and anonymity with
respect to a malicious veriﬁer, while R indicates if a
user can be revoked easily.
