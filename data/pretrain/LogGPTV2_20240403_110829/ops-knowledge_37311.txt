User:  What are RESTful APIs?
Assistant: RESTful API is an API based on the REST (Representational State Transfer, representational state transfer) architectural style for communication and data interaction between clients and servers. It provides a predictable standard interface to the client through the HTTP protocol, and uses a unified HTTP request method, status code, and URI to operate and access resources. RESTful API has the characteristics of easy development, flexibility, scalability, cacheability, and good visibility. It has become one of the most popular API design styles for Internet applications.
