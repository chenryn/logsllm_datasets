### Dominant Contributor to Long Page Download Times

The primary factor contributing to long page download times is the DNS lookup. Figure 2 presents statistics from our measurements in Ghana in 2012, where the timing breakdown categories (i.e., "Blocking" and "Waiting") are consistent with those defined in Section 4. Our observations indicate that DNS requests account for 37-40% of the user-perceived latency. 

While the issues highlighted here underscore the extreme nature of latency problems in developing countries, Accra actually has one of the fastest internet infrastructures in Africa. Other regions, such as South Africa, East Africa, and Southeast Asia, suffer from even worse network conditions, with higher latencies and fewer major network cables.

### TLS/SSL Impact on Latency

Our 2012 traces from Ghana revealed that approximately 8% of overall object requests required a secure connection. By 2014, this number had nearly doubled to 15%, reflecting the growing trend of secure content exchange on the web. In developing regions like Ghana, establishing a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection can significantly impact user-perceived latency due to the lengthy procedure and high sensitivity to latency. The basic TLS handshake consists of up to 9 round trips, depending on whether only the server or both the server and client are authenticated.

### Speeding Up Page Loads

#### DNS Caching

To understand the potential benefits of DNS caching, we analyzed our traces in detail. Figure 4 illustrates an example of long DNS requests from one of the webpages in the Accra 2012 cellular traces. In this example, the page requests objects from eleven external domains, each requiring a DNS request. To evaluate the ratio of DNS request delays to total page load time, we used the Wprof tool [31] to identify the critical path and calculate the contribution of DNS requests. We found that DNS delays accounted for about 72% of the overall page load time in Figure 4.

#### HTTP Redirects

Examining the Ghana traces more closely, we observed that in approximately 80% of cases, the first HTTP GET request was redirected to another page. These redirects were typically caused by HTTP status codes 301 (Moved Permanently) or 302 (Found). Most redirections were due to directing the browser to the www URL of the same page. For instance, in the example shown in Figure 1, the client initially requests `craigslist.org` and is redirected to `www.craigslist.org`.

#### HTTP Blocking

Another significant issue we observed is blocking, which contributes to more than 10% of the page load time, as seen in Figure 2. This is due to the configured maximum number of TCP connections to a server within the web browser. For example, in Figure 3, the browser has already requested six objects simultaneously using six TCP connections, and the next object (e.g., `header left.jpg`) must wait until one of the previous objects is downloaded. Modern web browsers also use HTTP pipelining with 4-8 pipelined objects, but Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking may still occur due to these limits.

### DNS Performance Analysis

In 2012, Ghana's DNS Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) (Figure 5a Wi-Fi and cellular) showed two distinct regions: a low delay region in milliseconds and a high delay region in seconds. Cross-referencing the domains, we found that 15% of the low delay domains were also present in the high delay region, suggesting that the low delay region was likely due to DNS caching at the local ISP DNS server.

In 2014, we conducted new experiments in Ghana using Alexa's top 1000 global websites and top 500 local websites. We observed a clear improvement in Accra's Wi-Fi DNS performance due to better DNS caching on the university network. However, the DNS performance over cellular networks improved only in Accra, while Kumawu's cellular DNS performance remained poor (Figure 5a right side).

### DNS Server Placement

DNS server placement is crucial for reducing latency. There are over 300 root servers globally, operated by 12 different organizations, accessible via 13 anycast IP addresses. The distribution of root and Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers is uneven, leading to varying performance across different regions.

To better understand the high DNS delay region in Figure 5a, we used the `dig` command-line tool to trace the full DNS lookup process. The results, depicted in Figures 7 and 8, show that Accra's DNS performance is generally worse compared to locations like New York and Bremen, indicating that the physical distance to DNS resolvers remains a significant issue.

### Caching Redirects

Caching redirects, as discussed in Section 4.2, can reduce the overall page load time by about 20%. However, this approach can cause revocation problems, as cached redirects may persist even after the original redirection is removed, leading to clients being directed to outdated servers.

### Conclusion

There is significant potential for enhancing DNS performance in Ghana through better DNS caching and strategic placement of root and TLD servers. Additionally, caching redirects can further improve page load times, though careful management is needed to avoid revocation issues.
