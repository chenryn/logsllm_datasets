To enhance security, configure the "Increase Scheduling Priority" option to restrict this right to members of the Administrators group. This ensures that only authorized users can schedule a process with elevated priority. 

You can implement this setting via Group Policy Object (GPO) by following these steps:
1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration**.
2. Go to **Policies**.
3. Select **Windows Settings**.
4. Choose **Security Settings**.
5. Open **Local Policies**.
6. Under **User Rights Assignment**, find and configure the **Increase scheduling priority** policy.

This configuration helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized processes being given higher priority, which could potentially impact system performance or be exploited for malicious purposes.
