**Title: Black Hat Asia 2023 - Breaking the Chain: An Attacker's Perspective on Supply Chain Vulnerabilities and Flaws**

In this presentation, we will dissect the cloud development workflow into five key phases: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), Source Code Management (SCM), package managers, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and artifacts. We will demonstrate how supply chain attacks can impact organizations at each of these stages, highlighting the risks associated with cloud infrastructure, platforms, and application development. 

From an attacker's perspective, we will explore methods to exploit these areas and reveal vulnerabilities and flaws in popular platforms relevant to each phase. Additionally, we will discuss the broader ecosystem and the practices developers use when working with these platforms.

Our talk will also feature original research, where we will present newly discovered vulnerabilities and flaws across various platforms. For each finding, we will discuss its implications and provide actionable mitigation strategies.
