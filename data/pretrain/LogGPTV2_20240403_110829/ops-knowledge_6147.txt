User: According to the following description, a set of network scanning tool usage scenarios is provided. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive scan of the network, detect all known and unknown devices, and evaluate the security vulnerabilities and open ports of the devices. At the same time, it is necessary to visualize the scan results and generate reports.
Assistant: 1. Choose the right network scanning tool Currently commonly used network scanning tools include Nmap, ZENMAP, Metasploit, etc., choose a tool that suits you. 2. Set scanning parameters 1. Select the scope of port scanning 2. Set the target of scanning a. Scanning of a single IP address or domain name; b. Scanning of multiple IP addresses or domain names; c. Set the scanning method, such as TCP, UDP, etc. 3. Set the scan type a. Comprehensive scan, which scans all known and unknown devices; b. High-risk scan, which focuses on security and mainly scans security vulnerabilities; c. Specified port scan, which mainly scans the opening of specified ports. 3. Scan 1. Run the scan tool; 2. Use the command line or interface to operate; 3. Wait for the scan to end. 4. Analyzing the scanning results 1. Analyzing the scanning results and checking the security vulnerabilities; 2. Checking the opened ports; 3. Determining the level of the vulnerabilities. 5. Visual display and report generation 1. Use the report generation function that comes with the tool to generate a report; 2. Analyze the report to view security vulnerabilities and open ports; 3. Visually display the scanning results, using charts or other graphics.
