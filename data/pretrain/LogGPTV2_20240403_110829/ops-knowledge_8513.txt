User: I'm currently trying to build and install the mySQLdb module for Python, but the command 
python setup.py build
gives me the following error 
running build
running build_py
copying MySQLdb/release.py -> build/lib.macosx-10.3-intel-2.7/MySQLdb
error: could not delete 'build/lib.macosx-10.3-intel-2.7/MySQLdb/release.py': Permission denied
I verified that I'm a root user and when trying to execute the script using sudo, I then get a gcc-4.0 error: 
running build
running build_py
copying MySQLdb/release.py -> build/lib.macosx-10.3-fat-2.7/MySQLdb

Which is odd, because I'm using XCode 4 with Python 2.7. I've tried the easy_install and pip methods, both of which dont work and give me a permission denied error on release.py. I've chmodded that file to see if that was the problem but no luck. Thoughts?
Assistant: Make sure that gcc-4.0 is in your PATH. Also, you can create an alias from gcc to gcc-4.0.
Take care about 32b and 64b versions. Mac OS X is a 64b operating system and you should right flags to make sure you're compiling for 64b architecture.
