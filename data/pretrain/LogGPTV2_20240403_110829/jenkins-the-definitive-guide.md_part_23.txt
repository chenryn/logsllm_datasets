### A Simple Email Message

Jenkins offers robust support for instant messaging (IM) notifications, which can be a valuable tool for keeping developers informed about build statuses in real-time. The Instant Messaging plugin provides a generic framework for IM communication, while protocol-specific plugins, such as those for Jabber and IRC, extend this functionality to support various IM protocols.

#### 8.7.1. IM Notification with Jabber

Many modern instant messaging servers are based on Jabber, an open-source, XML-based protocol. Jenkins has excellent support for Jabber, allowing developers to receive real-time notifications of build failures. Additionally, the plugin includes an IM bot that listens to chat channels and enables developers to run commands on the Jenkins server via chat messages.

**Setting Up IM Support in Jenkins:**

1. **Install Plugins:**
   - Install the Jenkins Instant Messaging plugin and the Jenkins Jabber Notifier plugin using the standard plugin manager.
   - Restart Jenkins (see Figure 8.9, “Installing the Jenkins IM plugins”).

2. **Configure Your Jabber Server:**
   - You can use a public service like Google Chat or set up your own internal messaging server (e.g., OpenFire).
   - Using a public service for internal communications may face administrative and firewall restrictions. Setting up an internal chat service is often more suitable for development teams, providing a dedicated channel for technical discussions.

3. **Create a Dedicated Account:**
   - Create a dedicated account on your Jabber server for Jenkins (see Figure 8.10, “Jenkins needs its own dedicated IM user account”).

4. **Configure Jenkins for Jabber Notifications:**
   - Go to the main configuration page and enable Jabber notifications.
   - Provide the Jabber ID and password for the dedicated account.
   - If using group chat rooms, specify the room names to allow Jenkins to process instructions from these channels (see Figure 8.11, “Setting up basic Jabber notification in Jenkins”).

5. **Advanced Configuration:**
   - In the Advanced section, you can specify the Jabber server name and port, a default suffix for generating Jabber IDs, and secure credentials if your Jenkins server is secured (see Figure 8.12, “Advanced Jabber configuration”).

6. **Set Up Build Job Notifications:**
   - For each build job, configure the recipient list and notification strategy (e.g., all builds, failures, changes, etc.).
   - You can also notify specific users or groups, such as SCM committers, culprits, and fixers (see Section 8.3, “More Advanced Email Notification”).

7. **Interact with Jenkins via IM:**
   - Developers can use their preferred IM client to receive notifications and interact with the build server using simple commands (see Figure 8.13, “Jenkins Jabber messages in action”).

#### 8.7.2. IM Notification using IRC

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is another popular form of instant messaging, particularly for group discussions. The Jenkins IRC plugin allows you to receive notifications and issue commands via an IRC channel.

**Setting Up IRC Support in Jenkins:**

1. **Install Plugins:**
   - Install the IRC plugin and the Instant Messaging plugin.
   - Restart Jenkins (see Figure 8.14, “Install the Jenkins IRC plugins”).

2. **Enable and Configure the IRC Plugin:**
   - Enable the IRC plugin and provide the hostname, port, dedicated channel, and nickname.
   - Set up a dedicated channel for CI notifications to avoid disturbing other chat activities (see Figure 8.15, “Advanced IRC notification configuration”).

3. **Configure Build Job Notifications:**
   - For each build job, enable IRC notifications and set up the notification strategy.
   - Customize the channel and message content if needed (see Figure 8.16, “Advanced build job IRC notification configuration”).

4. **Receive and Interact with Notifications:**
   - The IRC plugin will join the specified channels and send notifications based on the configured strategy (see Figure 8.17, “IRC notification messages in action”).

#### 8.9. Desktop Notifiers

Desktop notification tools integrate seamlessly into the developer's daily work environment. These tools can run as standalone applications or as part of the developer's IDE.

- **Eclipse Plugin:**
  - The Jenkins Eclipse plugin displays a health icon in the Eclipse window, providing detailed views of Jenkins projects (see Figure 8.18, “Jenkins notifications in Eclipse”).

- **Tray Application:**
  - The Jenkins Tray Application runs in the system tray, showing the current state of builds and pop-up notifications for new build failures (see Figures 8.19 and 8.20, “Running the Jenkins Tray Application”).

#### 8.10. Notification via Notifo

Notifo is a fast and cost-effective service for sending real-time notifications to smartphones and desktops.

**Setting Up Notifo for Jenkins:**

1. **Create Notifo Accounts:**
   - Each team member who wants to receive notifications needs a Notifo account.
   - Install the Notifo client on each device (Windows, Mac, iPhone, etc.).

2. **Set Up a Notifo Service Account:**
   - Create a service account for your Jenkins server.
   - Fill in the required fields, including the unique Service Username, Site URL, and Default Notification URL (see Figure 8.21, “Creating a Notifo service for your Jenkins instance”).

3. **Subscribe to the Service:**
   - Add developers to the list of subscribers by sending them subscription requests.

4. **Configure Jenkins for Notifo Notifications:**
   - Provide the API username and API Secret from the Notifo Service Dashboard (see Figure 8.22, “Configuring Notifo notifications in your Jenkins build job”).

5. **Receive Notifications:**
   - Jenkins will send almost real-time notifications to any Notifo clients the developer is running (see Figure 8.23, “Receiving a Notifo notification on an iPhone”).

#### 8.11. Mobile Notification

If your Jenkins server is accessible over the Internet, you can monitor builds using mobile devices.

- **iPhone:**
  - Use the free Hudson Helper application to list and manage build jobs (see Figure 8.24, “Using the Hudson Helper iPhone app”).

- **Android:**
  - Install the Hudson Mood widget for updates and alerts about build failures.

#### 8.12. SMS Notification

SMS is a reliable communication channel for reaching developers even when they are out of the office.

**Setting Up SMS Notifications:**

1. **Use an SMS Gateway:**
   - Many mobile vendors and third-party services provide SMS gateways.
   - Add the special email addresses for SMS notifications to the normal notification list or set up a separate rule (see Figure 8.25, “Sending SMS notifications via an SMS Gateway Service”).

2. **Receive SMS Notifications:**
   - Users will receive prompt notifications of build results via SMS (see Figure 8.26, “Receiving notification via SMS”).

This approach, while not free, is effective for reaching developers who are out of internet range or do not have data-enabled smartphones.
