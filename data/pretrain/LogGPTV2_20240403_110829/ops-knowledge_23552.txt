User: I frequently find that I need to run a series of python scripts sequentially. The order and number of these scripts may vary, but instead of executing each script individually and sequentially, is there a preferred way of batch automating a series of Python scripts? My programs require multiple and complex file path and other argument combinations.
Assistant: Refactor them into modules, then make a new script that imports the relevant functions from each module and runs those.
The easiest way to do this is to write a main function per module and run all the main function serially.
