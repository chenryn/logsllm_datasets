### Offline Volume Command

#### Description
The `offline volume` command transitions a selected online volume to an offline state.

#### Important Notes
- A volume must be selected for the `offline volume` command to succeed. Use the `select volume` command to choose a disk and shift the focus to it.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
offline volume [noerr]
```

#### Parameters
- **noerr** (Optional): 
  - For scripting purposes only.
  - When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
  - Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

#### Examples
To take the volume with the current focus offline, type:
```plaintext
offline volume
```

This command will transition the currently selected volume to an offline state. Ensure that the correct volume is selected before executing this command.
