### 4.2 Effectiveness of De-Anonymization with Noisy Mobility Traces

In this experiment, we utilize location data from the St Andrews trace, which has been obfuscated. We note that in both the Smallblue and Infocom06 datasets, only contact information is available. Our objective is to evaluate the performance of our recursive sub-graph matching algorithm as we introduce increasing levels of noise to the mobility trace. Specifically, we add independent and identically distributed (IID) noise to the location of each user at every time point.

Previous research has shown that physical constraints on user movement speed, combined with aggregate mobility models, can be used to de-obfuscate mobility traces. In this study, we construct a Markovian mobility model for all users, defined as \( P(l_{t+1} | l_t) \), which represents the probability that a user will be at location \( l_{t+1} \) at time \( t+1 \), given that they were at location \( l_t \) at time \( t \).

To enrich the per-user mobility traces, we employ two techniques:
1. **Viterbi Decoding**: This method deduces the most likely sequence of locations for a user at each time point. The computational complexity of Viterbi decoding is quadratic in the number of states (i.e., the number of location identifiers).
2. **Kalman Filtering**: This technique is used for both backward and forward smoothing to refine the location estimates. The computational complexity of Kalman filtering is cubic in the number of states.

Both Viterbi decoding and Kalman smoothing are applied as pre-processing steps to enhance the mobility trace, which is then used as input for the recursive sub-graph matching algorithm.

**Figure 13** illustrates the effectiveness of adding location noise to:
- All nodes in the mobility trace.
- Only landmark nodes in the mobility trace.

We observe that more sophisticated smoothing and state estimation algorithms, such as the Kalman filter, improve the de-anonymization efficacy, albeit at an increased computational cost. Adding noise to the mobility traces of landmark nodes is less effective because these nodes are identified as outliers based on their high centrality scores. For example, in a star topology contact graph where all nodes \(\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}\) are connected to a central node \(v_0\) and there are no connections between any other nodes, even with added location noise, it is easy to identify the central node \(v_0\).

**Figure 13** also demonstrates the impact of making \( p\% \) of user mobility traces identical. We randomly select \( p\% \) of the nodes and set the mobility trace of each selected node \( v \) to be identical to a randomly chosen node \( v' \). This makes nodes \( v \) and \( v' \) automorphic in the contact graph, thereby reducing the effectiveness of de-anonymization. This approach is more effective in lowering the efficacy of our algorithm compared to adding IID location noise to user mobility traces. Notably, in this scenario, the use of Viterbi decoding or Kalman filtering does not enhance the de-anonymization effectiveness.

### 4.3 Known Node Mappings

In some cases, one may have prior knowledge of the mappings between a small subset of nodes in the social network and the contact graph. This information could be inadvertently leaked or provided by insiders who participated in the mobility trace. **Figure 14** shows the increase in de-anonymization accuracy as more node mappings are revealed. We add known node mappings, including high centrality node mappings, as seed mappings and use the recursive sub-graph matching algorithm to derive the mappings for other nodes in the contact graph. For instance, when 10% of node mappings are known a priori, the accuracy of de-anonymization exceeds 95% with about 30% random node mappings.

We find that knowing the mappings for high centrality nodes is not particularly useful for de-anonymization, as our algorithm can detect such mappings with high fidelity. Conversely, revealing low centrality nodes, which are harder to de-anonymize, significantly enhances the de-anonymization effectiveness.

In the next experiment, we sort nodes in ascending order of their centrality score. **Figure 14** shows that when 10% of the nodes with the lowest centrality scores are known, the de-anonymization algorithm achieves an accuracy of 83% for the Infocom06 dataset, while the same number of node mappings for low centrality nodes achieves an accuracy of 90%.

### 4.4 Which Social Network to Use?

**Figure 15** illustrates the effectiveness of de-anonymization using different social networks. For the Infocom06 dataset, we constructed social networks based on co-authorship information from 2003 to 2009. The de-anonymization effectiveness initially increases as we approach 2006-07 and then decreases. However, the most effective de-anonymization is achieved using the 2007 co-authorship social network. This is likely because authors who met at the 2006 conference collaborated and published papers in 2007, leading to a stronger causal relationship between the 2006 contact graph and the 2007 social network.

### 5. Related Work

Location privacy for mobile users requires that it be difficult to track a user's location given a mobility trace. Several studies have examined the predictability and uniqueness of user location traces using various methods. For example, 802.11 user fingerprinting [26] identifies users using implicit identifiers such as IP addresses or SSIDs. Other approaches include RF fingerprinting [5], triangulation based on signal strength [17], and historical location patterns [20]. Shokri et al. [30] proposed a framework to quantify location privacy, showing that the effectiveness of anonymized mobility traces depends on both the extent of obfuscation and the fidelity of auxiliary information.

Several studies have explored the use of auxiliary data to break privacy. A common template for violating privacy using auxiliary information is: anonymized data + auxiliary information = de-anonymized data. Side channels, such as timing analysis [10] and power analysis [18], have been extensively studied. More recently, side-channel information (e.g., zip code, age, and sex of users) has been used to de-anonymize the Netﬂix Prize dataset [24].

The closest related work is [23], which proposes graph de-anonymization for social networks. Our work builds on this by using node centrality to identify landmark nodes, reducing the problem to weighted graph matching and tree edit distance, and formulating it as a dynamic constraint satisfaction problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt to leverage social networks as a side channel to de-anonymize user mobility traces.

### 6. Summary

In this paper, we explore the use of inter-user correlations inferred from publicly available social networks to de-anonymize mobility traces. Unlike previous work that relied on detailed per-user models, we exploit structural similarities between the contact graph and the social network to deduce node mappings. We validate our approach using three real-world datasets and show that it achieves over 80% accuracy with a computational cost of a few minutes.
