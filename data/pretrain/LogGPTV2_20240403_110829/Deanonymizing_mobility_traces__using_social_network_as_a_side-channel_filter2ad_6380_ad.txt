the mobility trace is obfuscated. In this experiment we use the lo-
cation information available from the St Andrews trace. We note
that in both the Smallblue and Infocom06 dataset we only have
the contacts. We examine the efﬁcacy of our recursive sub-graph
matching algorithm as we add more noise to the mobility trace − in
our experiments we add IID (independent and identical distributed)
noise to the location of each user each point in time. As shown in
past work, one can use physical limitations on the speed at which a
user may move and aggregate mobility models to de-obfuscate the
mobility trace. In particular, we use the mobility trace to construct
a Markovian mobility model built over all users: P r(lt+1|lt), the
probability that a user may be location lt+1 at time t + 1 given that
the user was at location lt at time t.
We use the Markovian mobility model (built over all users) to en-
rich per-user mobility traces. In particular, we used two techniques
to reﬁne the obfuscated mobility trace: (i) using Viterbi decoding
[31] to deduce the location of user u at time t (this algorithm is
quadratic in the number of states = number of location identiﬁers)
and (ii) using Kalman ﬁltering [31] for both backward and forward
smoothing to deduce the location of user u at time t (this algorithm
is cubic in the number of states = number of location identiﬁers).
We note that these both Viterbi decoding and Kalman smoothing
is applied as a pre-processing to enrich the mobility trace − the
enriched mobility trace is then used as input by the recursive sub-
graph matching algorithm.
Figure 13 shows the effectiveness of adding location noise to: (i)
all nodes in the mobility trace and (ii) to only landmark nodes in the
mobility trace. We note that using more sophisticated smoothing
and state estimation algorithms (e.g., Kalman ﬁlter) enhances the
efﬁcacy of de-anonymization (at a added computational cost). We
also note that adding noise to the mobility traces of landmark nodes
is not quite effective; this is because we detect landmark nodes
that are outliers with respect to node centrality score. In general
the centrality score of landmark nodes are signiﬁcantly higher than
the remaining nodes; hence, even with added location noise the
centrality score of landmark nodes tend be outliers. For example,
consider a star topology contact graph, wherein all nodes {v1, v2,
··· , vn} are in contact with node v0 and there is no contact between
two nodes vi and vj such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Even with added
location noise we see that it is easy to identify node v0.
Figure 13 also shows the efﬁcacy of our algorithm when p% of
user mobility traces are identical, that is, we randomly select p%
nodes and for each selected node v we select a random node v(cid:48)
and set the mobility trace of v to be identical to that of v(cid:48). Doing
so makes the nodes v and v(cid:48) automorphic in the contact graph,
thereby, decreasing the effectiveness of de-anonymization. We note
that this approach is more effective in lowering the efﬁcacy of our
algorithm than adding IID location noise to user mobility traces.
Note that in this approach to location obfuscation the use of Viterbi
decoding or Kalman ﬁlter does not enhance the effectiveness of de-
anonymization.
4.3 Known Node Mappings
In certain cases one may a priori know the mappings between a
small subset of nodes in the social network and the contact graph.
This could be due to information that is inadvertently leaked or due
to insiders (who participated in the mobility trace) that reveal their
mapping information. Figure 14 shows the increase in effectiveness
of de-anonymization when more node mappings are revealed. We
simply add known node mappings in addition to high centrality
node mappings as a seed mapping and uses recursive sub-graph

could in part verify this conjecture by measuring the number of co-
authored papers in 2006 and 2007 respectively, by authors who met
frequently during the 2006 conference − indeed our dataset shows
a 12% increase in the number of such co-authored papers. Hence,
the effectiveness of 2007 social network (over the 2006 social net-
work) can be explained by its stronger causal relationship with the
contact graph in 2006. We remark that this observation serves as a
measure to quantify the effectiveness of conferences in increasing
collaborative research amongst authors.
5. RELATED WORK
Location privacy (as applied to mobile users) requires that it be
hard to track the location of a user given a mobility trace. In partic-
ular several authors have examined the predictability and unique-
ness of user location traces using diverse tools; for a survey on
past work we refer the readers to [19]. For example, 802.11 user
ﬁngerprinting [26] attempts to identify a user using implicit iden-
tiﬁers such as IP addresses or the service set identiﬁer (SSID) be-
ing actively searched by a user’s device; others have suggested RF
(Radio Frontend) ﬁngerprinting [5] to uniquely identiﬁer a user’s
device; others have proposed the use of triangulation (e.g., based
on received signal strength from multiple vantage points) to further
improve the precision of a user’s location [17]; others have sug-
gested that a user be ﬁngerprinted using a historical set of locations
visited by that user (e.g., a per-user Markovian mobility model as
discussed earlier in Section 1); [20] proposes a framework for rec-
ognizing mobile users’ activities based on the places they visit and
also the temporal patterns of their visit.
More recently, Shokri et al. [30] proposed a solution to quantify
location privacy with the goal of providing a uniﬁed framework that
can be used to evaluate various location obfuscation mechanisms.
Their paper presents solutions to quantify location privacy given an
obfuscated mobility trace and the Markovian mobility model. They
show that the effectiveness of an anonymized mobility trace in pro-
tecting location privacy not only depends upon the extent of obfus-
cation but also the ﬁdelity of the auxiliary information. However,
their location privacy metrics only apply to auxiliary information
of the type per-user Markovian mobility model.
Several authors have explored the use of auxiliary data (some-
times referred to as side channel information) to break privacy. A
generic template for violating privacy using auxiliary information
is often represented as follows [24]: anonymized data + auxiliary
information = de-anonymized data. Side channels in the form of
timing analysis [10] and power analysis [18] have been extensively
studied in literature. More recently, authors have used side-channel
information (e.g., zipcode, age and sex of users) to de-anonymize
the Netﬂix Prize dataset [24].

matching algorithm to derive the node mappings for other nodes
in the contact graph. For example, when Known Node Mappings
/ No of Nodes is 0.1 then 10% of node mappings are assumed to
be known a priori. We observe that given about 30% random node
mappings the accuracy of de-anonymization exceeds 95%.
We remark that knowing the node mappings for high centrality
nodes is not quite useful for de-anonymization since our algorithm
can detect such mappings with high ﬁdelity. On the other hand,
the ﬁgure shows the effectiveness of de-anonymization when low
centrality nodes are revealed (these are nodes that are hard to de-
anonymize).
In the next experiment we sort nodes in ascending order of their
centrality score. In Figure 14, when Known Low Centrality Nodes
/ No of Nodes equals 0.1 then the mappings of 10% of nodes that
have the least centrality score are assumed to be known a priori.
We observe that given 10% random node mappings in the Info-
com06 dataset the de-anonymization algorithm achieves an accu-
racy of 83%, while given the same number of node mappings for
low centrality nodes achieves an accuracy of 90% (see Figure 14).
4.4 Which Social Network to Use?
Figure 15 shows the effectiveness of de-anonymization when
we use different social networks. In particular, for the Infocom06
dataset we constructed social networks (from DBLP publication
database) based on co-authorship information from year 2003, 2004,
··· , 2009 (note that Infocom06 dataset is a mobility trace col-
lected from the Infocom conference conducted in 2006). Figure
15 shows that the effectiveness of de-anonymization initially in-
creases as we approach 2006-07 and then decreases. However,
we observed that the de-anonymization is most effective using the
2007 co-authorship social network. We conjecture that this is be-
cause authors who met at the 2006 conference collaborated and

The closest related work is [23] that proposes using graph dea-
nonymization for social networks. Their approach in principle is
similar to our recursive sub-graph matching approach. However,
our work presents various key solutions over prior work: (i) using
node centrality to identify landmark nodes and bootstrap deanony-
mization, (ii) reductions to weighted graph matching and tree edit
distance problem, (iii) dynamic CSP formulation can be viewed as
a alternate formulation of the approach presented in [23], and (iv)
lower bounds based on automorphism. Finally, to the best of our
knowledge, this paper presents the ﬁrst attempt to leverage social
networks as a side-channel to de-anonymize user mobility traces.
6. SUMMARY
In this paper we explored an alternate source of auxiliary infor-
mation − inter-user correlations which can be often inferred from
publicly available social networks to de-anonymize mobility traces.
A vast majority of past work developed detailed per-user models
(e.g., a per-user Markovian mobility model) and used such mod-
els to identify the most probable user that could have generated an
anonymized trace. In contrast, this paper studied the use of inter-
user correlation models to address this problem. In particular, we
exploited structural similarities between two sources of inter-user
correlations (the contact graph and the social network) and devel-
oped techniques to leverage such structural similarities to deduce
mapping between nodes in the contact graph with that in the so-
cial network, thereby de-anonymizing the contact graph (and thus
the underlying mobility trace). We validated our hypothesis using
three real world datasets and showed that the proposed approach
achieves over 80% accuracy, while incurring no more than a few
minutes of computational cost in de-anonymizing these mobility
traces.
