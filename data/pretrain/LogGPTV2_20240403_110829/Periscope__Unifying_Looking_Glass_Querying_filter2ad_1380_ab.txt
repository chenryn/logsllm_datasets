Periscope had automatically generated the conﬁguration for 262 of these LGs;
35 LGs were not based on any of these initial templates and we parsed them
manually. The LG-to-ASN mapping is not always readily available. In these cases
we determined the IP address of the LG host and mapped it to an ASN using the
longest preﬁx matching method. To get the IP address of the router that hosts
each LG, we execute traceroutes against a machine under our control on which
we run tcpdump to capture the incoming traceroute packets and extract the
source address. We use the same technique to determine the traceroute protocol
used by each LG. We found that 266 LGs use UDP probes, and 31 LGs use ICMP
Echo Request probes. Whenever an LG supports both protocols, Periscope uses
ICMP traceroute.
Each LG may allow the execution of its commands from diﬀerent vantage
points (VPs) inside the AS network, such as routers in diﬀerent cities or routers
that have diﬀerent purposes (e.g. peering versus transit routers). We apply the
same methodology we used for inferring the ASN of each LG, to geolocate an
LG to a city whenever the LG interface does not reveal this information. After
we determine the IP address of each vantage point, we map it to a city using
NetAcuity’s geolocation database [4]. Figure 3 shows the geographic distribution
of LG vantage points that Periscope automatically parsed: 1,691 VPs distributed
over 501 cities in 76 countries. As shown in Fig. 4, 40 % of the LGs have more than
one city-level vantage point and 20 % of the LGs have ten or more VPs. Figure 5
shows how many VPs support each LG command extracted by Periscope.

Over 75 % of the VPs oﬀer both data and control plane measurements; 60 %
of the VPs support IPv6 commands in addition to IPv4. To determine which
of the LG VPs are located in border routers, we check whether the AS of the
ﬁrst hop is diﬀerent from the AS of the LG host. We examine the 416 VPs that
sourced at least 1000 traceroutes; of those, 222 had all traces going to an internal
next hop, and 194 LGs had at least one trace that went directly to an IXP hop
or a diﬀerent ASN – these 194 are likely borders (Fig. 6).
3.2 Comparison of Topological Coverage from LGs and Atlas
To compare the topology visible from our set of LGs, Atlas, and Ark VPs,
we executed a traceroute campaign from each platform toward 2,000 targets in
October 2015. At the time of our measurements, Atlas had 7,292 public probes
in 2,779 diﬀerent ASes across 160 countries, while Ark hadf 107 probes in 71
ASes across 41 countries.
To get an unbiased set of targets, we ﬁrst collected the IP addresses found
in the iPlane dataset [25], and executed a ZMap scan to keep only IPs that
responded to both UDP and ICMP probes. We mapped IP addresses to their
owner AS, and for each AS we randomly selected one IP address until we had
a target set of 2,000 IP addresses each in a diﬀerent AS, and spanning 151
countries [4]. This small sample is not necessarily representative of the global
Internet, but it is required due to the probing rate restrictions on LG and Atlas
infrastructure. We executed measurements from all Atlas probes, more than 6
million traceroutes in 2 months, using an account with elevated probing quota.
With the default rate limit, this probing would have taken ﬁve years [8].
We compared the number of ASes, AS links and IXPs (based on a list of
IXP preﬁxes extracted from PeeringDB [5]) observed in each dataset. Traces
from LG vantage points to the target destinations traversed 3109 ASes, 29525
AS links, and 167 IXPs. The traces from Atlas probes to the same targets tra-
versed 3369 ASes, 55936 AS links, and 171 IXPs, while traces from Ark traversed
1608 ASes, 10237 AS links, and 136 IXPs. Table 2 shows the number of ASes,

AS links and IXPs per dataset, including those uniquely observed in each dataset.
Interestingly, close to half (47 %) of AS links seen in the LG traces (13,969 out of
29,525) did not appear in the Atlas or Ark traces, while 26 % (809 out of 3109)
of ASes observed in the LG traces were not in Atlas or Ark traces. Finally, 16
IXPs observed in the LG traces were not observed in Atlas or Ark traces.
We compared ASes in each dataset using the customer cone as a metric of AS
size. The customer cone is the number of ASes in the downstream path of a given
AS, namely the number of ASes that can be reached through a customer, and it
expresses the inﬂuence of an AS in the transit market [24]. Figure 7 shows the
distribution of the customer cone sizes of ASes uniquely visible in the LG, Atlas
and Ark datasets. ASes unique to each of the datasets signiﬁcantly diﬀer in cone
size. LGs tend to capture more peripheral and stub ASes, while Ark and Atlas
capture ASes with larger customer cones, due to the diﬀerences in the ASes that
host the VPs of each platform. LGs are typically hosted in large transit providers
that mainly access destination addresses through downstream paths. In contrast,
Atlas and Ark VPs tend to be in eyeball ASes that traverse upstream paths
to reach the same destinations. Comparison of topology visible from the LGs,

them with traceroutes can enable city-level geolocation of IP interfaces.
Atlas VPs and Ark VPs reinforces our observation that the LG infrastructure
provides a complementary view of topology compared to that visible from the
existing Atlas and Ark infrastructures.
4 Case Studies
The ability to run BGP and traceroute measurements from the same LG VPs
enables sophisticated studies that may not be feasible without combining control-
plane and data-plane routing data.
4.1 Validation of IP-to-AS Mapping
Validation of IP-to-AS mapping techniques typically requires comparison of BGP
and traceroute paths obtained from VPs inside the same AS [26]. However, even
among the PoPs of one AS, intra-domain routing may induce diﬀerent paths
to the same destination. Having traceroute and BGP VPs as closely located
as possible, minimizes this risk, and LGs often support both functions from
the same router. To investigate this potential, we used Periscope to study the
accuracy of IP-to-AS translation when using longest preﬁx match to map IP
interfaces to ASNs. We randomly selected 500 addresses from the experiments
in Sect. 3.1, and executed concurrent traceroute and show ip bgp measurements
from 10 geographically diverse LGs. We sanitized the collected BGP paths by
removing AS loops, private and reserved ASNs, and we discarded traceroute
paths with unresponsive or unresolved interfaces. We compared the sanitized
BGP and traceroute paths toward a given destination, ignoring IXP hops and
repeated AS hops. Most path mismatches derived from traceroute missed the
last AS-level hop that appears in the corresponding BGP path (Fig. 8), which
typically happens when a router interface in a customer AS has an address from
its provider’s IP range [22].
4.2 Geolocation of IP Interfaces of Border Routers
Network operators often use the optional BGP communities attribute to tag a
BGP route with the entry point where it was received by an external peer [18].
However, BGP communities provide only geographical location but not actual
Periscope: Unifying Looking Glass Querying

IP interfaces of the border routers. Combining BGP communities with tracer-
oute paths from the same VP allows us to associate the locations encoded in the
communities values to router interfaces, by identifying the interface that corre-
sponds to the border between two ASes (Fig. 9). We applied this technique for
the AS286 LG, by executing simultaneous BGP and traceroute queries toward
the same targets used in Sect. 4.1. We pinpointed 89 border interfaces, between
AS286 and 58 of its AS-level neighbours, in 18 diﬀerent cities. All of our infer-
ences agreed with DNS-based geolocation [21], but only 66 of the interfaces had
a corresponding hostname. In contrast, only 38 % of the locations derived from
the communities agreed with the NetAcuity database. Through follow-up RTT
measurements we conﬁrmed the errors in the NetAcuity database.
5 Discussion and Future Work
We presented Periscope, a system that provides a uniﬁed interface to thousands
of Looking Glass servers hosted by ISPs around the world. Periscope oﬀers the
capability for users to query any LG server without having to interact with
individual LGs themselves, deal with timeouts and rate-limit issues, or develop
code to automate issuing queries and parse LG responses. We showed that the
topological view obtained from Periscope complements Atlas and Ark, serving
as a valuable addition to the set of measurement platforms. Periscope respects
the user-level limitations imposed by LGs, (a minimum time between successive
queries by the same user to a given LG, and a maximum number of concur-
rent queries on the LG), and does not allow users to query at a rate faster
than the LGs allow. Persicope distributes query instances, but measurements
are dispatched through the API and a central Controller, which enforce LG rate
limitations that cannot be overridden by querying instances. Preventing abuse
is important, not only ethically but also because overwhelming the LGs would
likely lead to their decommissioning from public use.
We plan to open Periscope for use by the research and operational community.
We expect that allowing users into the system will be a (somewhat) manual
process initially, mostly to prevent users from gaming the system by registering
multiple user accounts. Beyond that we believe that the system can scale to
many users, primarily because Periscope enforces the same per-user query quotas
that the LGs themselves impose. Consequently, as long as Periscope can employ
more LG clients than the typical number of query slots on a LG, the system can
service user requests at the same rate oﬀered by the LG. CAIDA’s Archipelago [1]
infrastructure already provides 132 active VPs that could be employed as LG
clients. Cloud-hosted and crowdsourced LG clients can augment the set of clients,
and reduce the querying load on each client. We provide documentation on
how to obtain access and use the Periscope API at http://www.caida.org/tools/
utilities/looking-glass-api/.
