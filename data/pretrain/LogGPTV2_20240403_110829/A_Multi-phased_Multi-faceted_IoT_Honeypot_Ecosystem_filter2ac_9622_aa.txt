## Abstract
The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices underscores the critical need to understand real-world cybersecurity threats. Traditionally, honeypots have been employed as decoys to mimic real devices and help researchers and organizations comprehend threat dynamics. For a honeypot to provide valuable insights, it must convince attackers that they are interacting with genuine systems. However, IoT devices present unique challenges due to their diverse types and physical connectivity. In this work, we:
1. Introduced a multi-phased, multi-faceted honeypot ecosystem where the sophistication of low-interaction IoT honeypots is incrementally enhanced based on observed attacker behaviors.
2. Developed a low-interaction honeypot for IoT cameras, enabling researchers to gain a detailed understanding of attackers' objectives.
3. Designed a proxy instance, ProxyPot, which sits between IoT devices and the external network, facilitating the study of inbound and outbound communication.

ProxyPot was used to enhance the understanding of attacks on IoT cameras and to increase the honeypot's sophistication. Over a two-year deployment, our results showed that we attracted increasingly sophisticated attack data in each phase, including activities that appeared to involve direct human interactions rather than purely automated scripts.

## Introduction
In recent years, IoT devices have become integral to daily life. It is estimated that by 2025, there will be at least 41.6 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet, representing a 512% increase from 2018 (8 billion IoT devices). This exponential growth raises significant concerns about new security threats. Many IoT devices have simple, accessible vulnerabilities, such as default usernames and passwords, and open telnet/ssh ports. The exposure to attacks on IoT devices is now a reality, often more severe than traditional computing systems. Each new IoT device can provide a new entry point for adversaries, potentially compromising the entire network. For example, over 20% of companies globally have experienced at least one IoT-related attack in recent years.

Developing effective cybersecurity measures requires a thorough understanding of existing and potential threats. IoT has become an attractive target for adversaries, making it crucial to understand their objectives and methods. Honeypots have long been used by security researchers to study various types of attacker behaviors. By analyzing data captured by honeypots (e.g., network logs, downloaded files), researchers can uncover new tools, methods, and zero-day vulnerabilities, which are invaluable for improving cybersecurity, especially for resource-constrained organizations.

Creating useful IoT honeypots presents two main challenges:
1. The vast variety of IoT devices, each with unique features, makes it infeasible to build a single honeypot system that can capture all or even a significant portion of them. Therefore, we adopt a multi-faceted approach to IoT honeypot engineering.
2. The specific nature of attackers' activities towards IoT devices is largely unknown, and their focuses can vary significantly. Additionally, the richness of responses from IoT devices, due to their interaction with the physical world, requires substantial engineering effort to emulate. We address this by adopting a multi-phased approach, gradually increasing the sophistication of emulated responses as data is gathered and analyzed.

In this work, we present a comprehensive experimentation and engineering framework for capturing and analyzing real-world cyber-attacks on IoT devices using honeypots.

## IoT Honeypot Ecosystem
To create a successful honeypot environment for IoT security research, simply running emulated or real IoT devices is insufficient. Honeypots need to be carefully maintained and monitored to adapt their responses to different types of traffic, ensuring that attackers remain interested. Our goal was to design a well-integrated ecosystem where various honeypot devices work together with a vetting and analysis infrastructure. Figure 1 illustrates our implemented ecosystem, which consists of three key components:

1. **Honeypot Server Farms**: We utilized both on-premise servers and cloud infrastructures. Cloud servers provided vantage points in different countries, covering a wide geographic range.
2. **Vetting System**: A honeypot is only valuable if it remains undetectable. The vetting system ensures that servers are difficult for adversaries to identify as honeypots. We used various fingerprinting approaches, both manual and automatic (e.g., through Metasploit), and leveraged Internet device search engines like Shodan and Censys to ensure our honeypots appear authentic. We also analyzed honeypot logs to identify and counteract fingerprinting attempts.
3. **Analysis Infrastructure**: The success of a honeypot depends on both its development and implementation and the log analysis process. We used Splunk for log management and analysis, centralizing all logs on a Splunk server. We developed an app on Splunk to automate the analysis processes and integrate with services like VirousTotal, DShield, and AbuseIPDB.

This comprehensive approach allowed us to gather and analyze valuable data on real-world cyber-attacks targeting IoT devices.
