ABSTRACT
The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices makes it vitally
important to understand real-world cybersecurity threats to them.
Traditionally, honeypots have been used as decoys to mimic real de-
vices on a network and help researchers/organizations understand
the dynamic of threats. A crucial condition for a honeypot to yield
useful insights is to let attackers believe they are real systems used
by humans and organizations. However, IoT devices pose unique
challenges in this respect, due to the large variety of device types
and the physical-connectedness nature. In this work, we (1) pre-
sented an approach to create a multi-phased multi-faceted honeypot
ecosystem, where researchers gradually increase the sophistication
of a low-interaction IoT honeypot by observing real-world attack-
ers’ behaviors, (2) built a low-interaction honeypot for IoT cameras
that allowed researchers to gain a concrete understanding of what
attackers were going after on IoT camera devices, and (3) designed
a proxy instance, called ProxyPot, that sits between IoT devices and
the external network and helps researchers study the IoT devices’
inbound/outbound communication. We used PorxyPot as a means
to understanding attacks against IoT cameras and increasing the
honeypot’s sophistication. We deployed honeypots for more than
two years. Our preliminary results showed that we were able to
attract increasingly sophisticated attack data in each new phase.
Moreover, we captured activities that appeared to involve direct
human interactions rather than purely automated scripts.

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years, IoT devices have become an essential tool
in people’s daily activities. It was estimated that by 2025, there will
be at least 41.6 billion IoT devices connected to the Internet [1],
a 512% increase compared to 2018 (8 billion IoT devices) [2]. The
exponential growth poses grave concerns regarding new security
threats. Most IoT devices have simple accessible vulnerabilities
including default username and password and open telnet/ssh port,
to name just two. We are unfortunately at a time when exposure
to attacks against IoT devices has become a reality, if not worse
compared to traditional computing systems. Each new IoT device
could offer a new passageway to adversaries and expose the entire
network. For instance, more than 20% of companies around the
world have experienced at least one IoT-related attack in the past
few years [3, 4].
Creating an effectual cyber-security procedure or product needs
a thorough understanding of the existing and possible threats. IoT
has become an interesting new target for adversaries. It is thus
highly crucial to understand what those attackers want, as well as
their modus operandi. For a long time honeypots have helped secu-
rity researchers to understand various types of attacker behaviors.
By analyzing data captured by honeypots (network logs, down-
loaded files, etc.), researchers can uncover new tools and methods
used by hackers, attack trends, and zero-day vulnerabilities. This
information is highly valuable to improve cybersecurity measures,
especially when organizations are resource-strapped when it comes
to fixing security vulnerabilities.
There are two main challenges for creating IoT honeypots that
can yield useful data for research:
(1) The types of different IoT devices are vast, each of which
has unique features that an attacker may wish to access. It
is infeasible to build one honeypot system that can capture
even a significant portion of all IoT devices. Thus, we adopt
a multi-faceted approach to IoT honeypot engineering.
(2) The specific nature of attackers’ activities towards IoT de-
vices is largely unknown at this point, and there could be
very different focuses on the attacker’s side. Moreover, rich-
ness of the response from an IoT device is much greater than
traditional IT systems due to the interaction with the physi-
cal world. It would require significant amount of engineering
work to emulate those different types of responses for differ-
ent devices. Thus, we adopt a multi-phased approach where
the sophistication of the emulated responses are gradually
increased as data is gathered and analyzed to understand
what the attackers might be going after.
In this work, we present our approach towards a comprehensive
experimentation and engineering framework for capturing and
analyzing real-world cyber-attacks on IoT devices using honeypots.

To have a successful honeypot environment for research in IoT secu-
rity, just having boxes running different emulated or real IoT devices
is not sufficient. The honeypots need to be carefully maintained and
monitored to allow intelligent adaptation on the way they respond
to different types of traffic, so an attacker can be “hooked” and
made interested in further exploring it. Our goal was to create a
carefully designed ecosystem where a variety of honeypot devices
working together with a “vetting” and “analysis infrastructure” by
their side. Figure 1 illustrates our implemented ecosystem, which
consists of three separate components.
1) Honeypot server farms: In this study, we used both an on-
premise server and cloud infrastructures. Using cloud servers helped
us gain vantage points in different countries and cover a wide range
of geographic locations.
2) Vetting system: A honeypot is valuable only as long as it re-
mains undetectable. The vetting system ensures servers are suffi-
ciently difficult for an adversary to detect them as a honeypot. For
this purpose, we tried a number of fingerprinting approaches to vet
any new honeypot instance. Both manual and automatic vetting
were used (e.g., through Metasploit). In addition, we used Internet
device search engines Shodan [5] and Censys [6] to make sure they
look like the real ones they imitate. Most importantly, we analyzed
our honeypot logs to identify fingerprinting attempts. We then
adapt our honeypots to render those fingerprinting approaches
ineffective.
3) Analysis infrastructure: The success of a honeypot depends
on two factors: 1) the way the honeypot software is developed and
implemented; and 2) the log analysis process. Carefully analyzing
the logs is as important as the honeypot development and imple-
mentation. We utilized Splunk [7] for log management and analysis.
All the logs captured in our ecosystem are sent to our centralized
Splunk server. We designed an app on Splunk that automated the
analysis processes and used VirousTotal, DShield, and AbuseIPDB 1
