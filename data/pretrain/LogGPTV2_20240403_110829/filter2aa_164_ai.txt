### Configuring Boot Options
3. To answer the question "Should we boot straight to desktop?", type either `Yes` (to enable GUI boot at launch) or `No` (to disable GUI autolaunch).
4. When exiting Raspi-Config, respond to the prompt "Would you like to reboot now?" by typing `Yes` and pressing Enter.

### Touring the LXDE Interface
Using Figure 6.1 as a guide, let's review the Desktop icons and user interface elements in LXDE. For now, focus on the icons along the left-hand side of the screen, and ignore the annotations at the bottom; we will cover those later.

#### Left-Hand Side Icons
- **Midori**: A shortcut to Midori, a minimalist web browser that conserves system resources.
- **Scratch**: A link to Scratch 1.4. You will learn how to create Scratch programs in Chapters 8 and 9.
- **Pi Store**: A marketplace for Pi-compatible apps, which will be covered in more detail later.
- **WiFi Config**: A tool for setting up a WiFi connection. Networking options are discussed in Chapter 7.
- **Debian Reference**: Opens the Dillo web browser to display Debian reference pages in HTML format. These files are stored locally, so no internet connection is required.
- **IDLE 3**: The integrated development environment (IDE) for Python 3. Raspbian includes both Python 2 and Python 3, with Python being the recommended programming language for Raspberry Pi.
- **LXTerminal**: The command-line interface for the Pi.
- **OCR Resources**: A shortcut that opens Midori and navigates to the ICT and Computing page of the Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR) website, providing resources for integrating Raspberry Pi into academic curricula.
- **IDLE**: The IDE for Python 2.
- **Python Games**: An app launcher for trying out simple Python games.

#### Bottom Task Bar Annotations
The annotations at the bottom of Figure 6.1 are numbered for clarity:

1. **Main Menu**: Functions similarly to the Windows 7 Start menu.
2. **PCManFM**: A lightweight file manager, similar to Windows Explorer or OS X Finder.
3. **Midori**: The lightweight web browser.
4. **Minimize All**: Minimizes all onscreen windows to the LXPanel.
5. **Virtual Desktops**: Linux feature allowing multiple desktops. Customize this by right-clicking one of the virtual desktop icons and adjusting settings in the Openbox Configuration Manager.
   - **Note**: Virtual desktops extend your desktop environment beyond the physical monitor, allowing multiple desktops with separate application or document windows.
6. **LXPanel (bottom bar)**: Behaves like the Task Bar in Windows 7. Customize it by right-clicking an empty part of the task bar and selecting Panel Settings.
7. **CPU Usage Monitor**: Displays real-time CPU usage data.
8. **Digital Clock**: Right-click to edit clock settings. The clock format uses a unique style; visit [http://is.gd/XHcNwN](http://is.gd/XHcNwN) for more details.
9. **Screenlock**: Protects your Pi against unauthorized access when not in use.
10. **Logout**: Use this to leave the graphical environment, reboot, or shut down the Pi.

#### Application Launch Bar
Buttons B–D represent the Application Launch Bar. Add additional shortcuts by right-clicking one of the app shortcuts and selecting Application Launch Bar Settings.

### Delving into the Main Menu
The LXPanel Main Menu is a central part of the LXDE user experience. It functions similarly to the Windows 7 Start menu. Here’s a breakdown of the top-level navigation:

- **Accessories**: Tools such as an image viewer, Leafpad text editor, LXTerminal, and Xarchiver.
- **Education**: Links to Scratch and Squeak, the underlying management tool for Scratch.
- **Graphics**: View PDF files using the open-source xpdf viewer.
- **Internet**: Open Midori and Dillo browsers, and configure Wi-Fi settings.
- **Office**: Includes Orage Calendar and Orage Globaltime utilities.
- **Other**: A catch-all category for various tools.
- **Programming**: Launch Scratch or Python 2/3 IDLE development environments.
- **Sound & Video**: Configure the Pi’s onboard audio.
- **System Tools**: File renaming, task management, and Thunar File Manager.
- **Preferences**: System and file management utilities.
- **Run**: Issue terminal commands from the GUI.
- **Logout**: Exit the graphical environment.

### Customizing the Main Menu
The ordering and organization of the Main Menu can feel haphazard. There is no graphical method for customization, but you can manage the `.desktop` files in the `/usr/share/applications` directory. See [http://is.gd/OTcpFy](http://is.gd/OTcpFy) for more details.

### Installing, Updating, and Removing Software
In Chapter 5, you learned to use `apt-get` commands to update software repositories and installed software. Let’s revisit the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT).

#### Repositories
A repository is an online source of regularly updated installation packages. View the list of Raspbian repositories by opening LXTerminal and typing:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Update the repository with:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
```

#### Installing and Searching for Software
Install a package (e.g., XFCE):
```sh
sudo apt-get install xfce4
```
Search for a package:
```sh
sudo apt-cache search xfce4
```
List installed packages:
```sh
sudo dpkg --get-selections > ~/Desktop/packages
```
View the list:
```sh
nano ~/Desktop/packages
```

#### Uninstalling Software
Uninstall a package:
```sh
sudo apt-get remove xfce4
```
To completely remove an application and its configuration files:
```sh
sudo apt-get --purge remove pkgname
```

#### Periodic Updates
Periodically update the repositories and install detected updates:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Accessing the Pi Store
The Pi Store, shown in Figure 6.5, is a platform for finding and sharing Raspberry Pi-specific software. Create a free account to download or upload software.

#### Downloading a Free App
1. Double-click the Pi Store icon to open the program.
2. Click Login, then Register to create a free user account.
3. Navigate to the Games section and find a free app (e.g., CrazyWorms2).
4. Click Free Download to add the game to your library.
5. Select the game in My Library and click Launch to play.

### Tweaking the LXDE UI
Customize the LXDE interface to suit your preferences.

#### Changing the Desktop Background
1. Right-click an empty area of the desktop and select Desktop Preferences.
2. Adjust the wallpaper and background color, and customize icon label text.

#### Customizing LXTerminal
1. Open LXTerminal and click Edit, Preferences.
2. Customize the terminal font, colors, cursor style, and scrollback value.

#### Customizing LXPanel
1. Right-click an applet in the panel and select the first option to customize it.
2. Select Panel Settings to open the global configuration dialog. Customize the position, appearance, and applets included on the panel.

### Openbox
Openbox is the Window Manager behind LXPanel. Access the Openbox Configuration Manager from the Main Menu to make further tweaks.

### Editing Configuration Files
Despite the control provided by GUIs, many configurations require editing text files. For example, to disable the screensaver, edit the LXDE autostart file:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
```
Remove the line:
```sh
@xscreensaver -no-splash
```
Save and exit the file.

### Networking Raspberry Pi
#### Basic Networking Concepts
- **Ethernet**: The standard protocol for local area networks (LANs) and the Internet.
- **IP Address**: Each device must have a unique IP address for meaningful communication.
- **IPv4**: The current standard, represented as `192.168.1.204`.
