Hello,
I run scrapy v1.1.0
I need some parts of the url to create some ids. Lately I have been noticing
that response.request.url is returning a different url that the one that is
used to scrape.
In my code I use the item['LINK'] = response.request.url but that is putting
in the wrong link on some scrapers like 2/10 approximately.
Is there a better way to fetch the url? The one that is displayed in the debug
scrapy output is correct.
Thank you.
This one outputted in the debug window is correct:

The one I fetch with response.request.url is different and wrong.
