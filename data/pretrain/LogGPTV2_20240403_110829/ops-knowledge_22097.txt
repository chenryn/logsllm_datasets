User: I have a python module that is shared among several of my projects (the projects each have a different working directory).  One of the functions in this shared module, executes a script using os.spawn.  The problem is, I'm not sure what pathname to give to os.spawn since I don't know what the current working directory will be when the function is called.  How can I reference the file in a way that any caller can find it?  Thanks!
Assistant: So I just learned about the __file__ variable, which will provide a solution to my problem. I can use file to get a pathname which will be constant among all projects, and use that to reference the script I need to call, since the script will always be in the same location relative to __file__. However, I'm open to other/better methods if anyone has them.
