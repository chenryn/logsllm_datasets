FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION
Minutiae and Typica
FINGERPRINT SENSORS
OPTICAL FINGERPRINT SENSOR
Optical fingerprint sensors 
are the oldest method of 
capturing and comparing 
fingerprints. this technique 
relies on capturing an 
optical image, essentially a 
photograph, and using 
algorithms to detect unique 
patterns on the surface, 
such as ridges or unique 
marks, by analyzing the 
lightest and darkest areas of 
the image.
CAPACITIVE FINGERPRINT SENSOR
Capacitive fingerprint sensors 
use tiny capacitor circuits to 
collect data about a fingerprint. 
As capacitors can store electrical 
charge, connecting them up to 
conductive plates on the surface 
of the scanner allows them to be 
used to track the details of a 
fingerprint. 
The charge stored in the 
capacitor will be changed slightly 
when a finger’s ridge is placed 
over the conductive plates, while 
an air gap will leave the charge 
at the capacitor relatively 
unchanged. An integrator circuit 
is used to track 
these changes.
ULTRASONIC FINGERPRINT SENSOR
The hardware consists of an 
ultrasonic transmitter and a 
receiver. An ultrasonic pulse 
is transmitted against the 
finger that is placed over the 
scanner. Some of this pulse 
is absorbed and some of it 
is bounced back to the 
sensor, depending upon the 
ridges, pores and other 
details that are unique to 
each fingerprint.

MATERIALS NEEDED FOR THE TESTS (THESE AND 
A LOT MORE)
GREASE ATTACKS 
Preconditions for the attack
For using this kind of attack one needs to have a clear 
grease stain left on the surface of the scanner. This stain 
has to have most of the important characteristics of the 
fingerprint left on the pad so that the scanner can reliably 
read the same line-ends and curves that it detected on the 
previous user
Requirements:
● Fingerprint scanner
● Legitimate user enrolled fingerprint
● Applicable fingerprint stain on the scanner's pad left by 
the previous user
● Temperature between 0-50°C (scanners operating 
temperature)
● Gummy bears, silicone fingertips, playdoh, latex gloves
GREASE ATTACK RESULTS
Materials Tested and Results:
•
Gummy Bears: Finger recognized
•
Playdoh: Finger recognized
•
Latex Glove: Finger recognized
•
Moist Breathe: No Finger recognized
•
Silicon Fingertip: Finger recognized
“ENHANCED” GREASE ATTACKS AND RESULTS
The problem with grease attacks is that in most cases, a regular grease stain on the scanner surface is not 
enough to fool the sensor. We need to enhance it with other substances to obtain better results 
impersonating legitimate users, these substances must be transparent so that the user does not notice 
them and with ointment consistency to better enhance the fingerprint stain. This substance could be spread 
in the legitimate user fingerprint or on the fingerprint sensor.

CONSENSUAL ATTACKS (WITH COOPERATION)
Preconditions for the attack
The term consensual suggests the user we are taking the 
fingerprint from is aware of the process and actively participates by 
pressing his finger into some kind of a mold.
Even though we have classified this approach as “consensual”, 
there are unconsensual ways to go about achieving the same.

•
Alginate
•

•

•

CONSENSUAL ATTACKS RESULTS
UNCONSENSUAL ATTACKS (WITHOUT 
COOPERATION)
In these attacks the user does not participate actively and latent 
fingerprints are obtained in a non-cooperative way. Assuming the 
correct latent fingerprint has been identified, the following are the 
steps to follow:
Procedure
1.
Enhancing the latent fingerprint
      with glue fumes or fingerprint powder
2.   Lifting the latent fingerprint with
      digital camera or transparent tape
3.   Digitally enhancing the fingerprint
      with software
4.   Creating a mold
5.   Casting artificial fingers with
      silicone, liquid latex or wood glue

UNCONSENSUAL ATTACKS WITH 3D PRINTING: 
MATERIALS AND SOFTWARE
The precision of a domestic UV Resin printer is 25 microns. Human papillary ridges in 
general have a height between 20-60 microns.
UNCONSENSUAL ATTACKS WITH 3D PRINTING
Procedure
1. Lift the latent fingerprint with a digital camera with macro functionality
2. Use a tool for digitally enhance the fingerprints, for example this Python tool based on the 
Utkarsh-Deshmukh tool: https://github.com/ylevalle/Fingerprint-Enhancement-Python
3. Convert the enhanced JPG file to an SVG file, import the SVG file into Tinkercad to create 
a 3D model of the fingerprint
4. Configure the fingerprint length and width according to the measures of the original latent 
fingerprint, put a thin back block behind the fingerprint, configure the ridge height and create 
two different 3D models: one negative or hollow for casting and one positive for direct tests. 
5. Export the 3D models file in a 3D printable file format (STL) and upload it on the Anycubic 
Photon 3D Printer. 
6. Once the printing is completed, the 3D printed molds require rinsing in Isopropyl alcohol. 
After rinsed parts dry, the molds require post-curing using an UV lamp or direct sunlight.
7. Fill the 3D printed negative or hollow molds with:

liquid latex or wood glue
