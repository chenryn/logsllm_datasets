# Bypassing Biometric Systems with 3D Printing
**Yamila Levalle @ylevalle**

## What is a Biometric System?
Biometric systems use unique physical or behavioral traits to identify individuals. These traits can be broadly categorized into:

### Behavioral Traits:
- Gait
- Voice
- Signature

### Physical Traits:
- Iris
- Fingerprint
- Ear Shape
- DNA
- Face
- Vein Pattern

## How Biometric Systems Work
Biometric systems capture and analyze these traits to verify an individual's identity. The process typically involves:
1. **Enrollment**: Capturing the biometric data.
2. **Storage**: Storing the biometric template.
3. **Comparison**: Comparing the captured data with the stored template during verification.

## Biometric System Attacks
Biometric systems are not immune to attacks. Presentation attacks, where an attacker presents a fake biometric sample, are a significant threat. Here are some real-life examples:

### United States 2010
- **Bank Robbery**: A bank robbery involving the use of a mask to bypass facial recognition.
- **Masked Plane Passenger**: A passenger using a mask to board a plane.

### Canada 2014
- **Suspects on the Left and Suspects Wearing Masks on the Right**: Images showing suspects both with and without masks.

### United States 2015
- **Bank Robbery**: Another instance of a bank robbery using a mask.

### China 2011
- **Masked Suspects**: Suspects wearing masks to evade detection.

## Presentation Attacks in Real Life: Fake Fingers
Fake fingers can be used to bypass fingerprint recognition systems. This section explores how 3D printing can facilitate such attacks.

## Making My Own Experiments to Bypass Biometric Systems
### Fingerprint Recognition
Fingerprints have unique features called minutiae, which include ridge endings and bifurcations. These are the key elements that fingerprint sensors analyze.

### Fingerprint Sensors
#### Optical Fingerprint Sensor
- **Description**: The oldest method, capturing an optical image (essentially a photograph) of the fingerprint.
- **Functionality**: Uses algorithms to detect unique patterns on the surface by analyzing the lightest and darkest areas of the image.

#### Capacitive Fingerprint Sensor
- **Description**: Uses tiny capacitor circuits to collect data about the fingerprint.
- **Functionality**: The charge stored in the capacitors changes when a finger’s ridge is placed over the conductive plates, while an air gap leaves the charge relatively unchanged. An integrator circuit tracks these changes.

#### Ultrasonic Fingerprint Sensor
- **Description**: Uses an ultrasonic transmitter and receiver.
- **Functionality**: An ultrasonic pulse is transmitted against the finger. Some of the pulse is absorbed, and some is bounced back, depending on the ridges, pores, and other details unique to each fingerprint.

### Devices to Test
- **Hysoon FF395**: Optical Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition
- **Samsung Galaxy S10**: Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition
- **Samsung Galaxy A30**: Capacitive Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition
- **TA040**: Optical Fingerprint Scanner

### Materials Needed for the Tests
- Fingerprint scanner
- Legitimate user enrolled fingerprint
- Temperature between 0-50°C (operating temperature)
- Gummy bears, silicone fingertips, playdoh, latex gloves

## Grease Attacks
### Preconditions for the Attack
- Clear grease stain on the scanner surface with most of the important characteristics of the fingerprint.
- Temperature between 0-50°C.

### Requirements
- Fingerprint scanner
- Legitimate user enrolled fingerprint
- Applicable fingerprint stain on the scanner's pad left by the previous user
- Temperature between 0-50°C
- Gummy bears, silicone fingertips, playdoh, latex gloves

### Grease Attack Results
- **Gummy Bears**: Finger recognized
- **Playdoh**: Finger recognized
- **Latex Glove**: Finger recognized
- **Moist Breathe**: No finger recognized
- **Silicon Fingertip**: Finger recognized

### Enhanced Grease Attacks and Results
- **Problem**: Regular grease stains are often insufficient to fool the sensor.
- **Solution**: Enhance the stain with transparent substances of ointment consistency to better mimic the fingerprint.

## Consensual Attacks (With Cooperation)
### Preconditions for the Attack
- The user is aware and actively participates by pressing their finger into a mold.

### Materials for Molds
- Alginate
- Epoxy putty
- Playdoh
- Hot glue
- Candle wax

### Materials for Casting
- Silicone
- Ballistic gelatin
- Liquid latex
- Synthetic resin
- Wood glue

2. Lift the latent fingerprint with a digital camera or transparent tape.
3. Digitally enhance the fingerprint with software.
4. Create a mold.
5. Cast artificial fingers with silicone, liquid latex, or wood glue.

## Unconsensual Attacks with 3D Printing
### Precision
- Domestic UV Resin printer precision: 25 microns
- Human papillary ridges height: 20-60 microns

### Procedure
1. Lift the latent fingerprint with a digital camera with macro functionality.
2. Use a tool for digitally enhancing the fingerprints, e.g., this Python tool: [Fingerprint-Enhancement-Python](https://github.com/ylevalle/Fingerprint-Enhancement-Python).
3. Convert the enhanced JPG file to an SVG file, import it into Tinkercad to create a 3D model of the fingerprint.
4. Configure the fingerprint length and width according to the original latent fingerprint, add a thin back block behind the fingerprint, configure the ridge height, and create two different 3D models: one negative or hollow for casting and one positive for direct tests.
5. Export the 3D models in STL format and upload them to the Anycubic Photon 3D Printer.
6. Rinse the 3D printed molds in Isopropyl alcohol, dry them, and post-cure using an UV lamp or direct sunlight.
7. Fill the 3D printed negative or hollow molds with liquid latex or wood glue.
