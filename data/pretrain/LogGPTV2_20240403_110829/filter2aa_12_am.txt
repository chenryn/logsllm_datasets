400
Bad   request
The   request could not be understood by the server due to a syntax problem.   The request should be modified by the client before resending to it.
Check the   website address. This can also happen due to a site error.
401
Authorization   required
The   client is denied access due to the lack of authentication codes.
Check   your username and password.
402
Payment   required
Reserved   for future use.
403
Forbidden
The   client is not allowed to see a specific file. This can be due to the server   access limit.
Check the   credentials. Also, there are fewer chances that the server is loaded.
404
Not found
The   requested resource could not be found.
This can   be because the resource was deleted, or it never existed before. It can also   be due to URL misspellings.
405
Method   not allowed
The   method you are using to access the file is not supported or not allowed by   the resource.
406
Not   acceptable
Content   generated by the resource is not acceptable according to the client request.
Check/update   your browser.
407
Proxy   authentication required
Request   authentication is required before it can be performed.
The   client must first authenticate itself with the proxy.
408
Request   timed out
It took   the server longer than the allowed time to process the request.
Check   response time and load on the network.
409
Conflict
The   request submitted by the client cannot be completed because it   conflicts with some established rules.
Can be   because you try to upload a file that is older that the existing one or   similar problems. Check what the client is trying to do.
410
Gone
The URL   requested by the client is no longer available from that system.
Usually   this is a server problem. It can be due to a file that was deleted or   location was forwarded to a new location.
411
Content   length required
The   request is missing itsContent-Length header.
Compatibility   issue on a website. Change/update your browser.
412
Precondition   failed
The   client has not set up a configuration that is required for the file to be   delivered.
Compatibility   issue on a website. Change/update your browser.
413
Request   entity too long
The   requested file was too big to process.
Server   limitation.
414
Request   URI too long
The   address you entered was overly long for the server.
Server   limitation.
415
Unsupported   media type
The file   type of the request is not supported.
Server   limitation.
以下示例是一个简单的客户端报错。按照以下步骤进行操作：
右键有报错的报文。
选择Follow TCP stream，会看到以下窗口：
显示以下内容：
客户端尝试浏览URI/poker-client/broadcast.htm（如截屏中1和3所示）
URI通过http://www.888poker.com/poker-client/promotions.htm转发（截屏中2所示）
状态码为404 Not Found（如截屏中4所示）

Explanation
What    to do
500
Internal   server error
The web   server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from   carrying out the client request for access to the requested URL.
Response   that is usually caused by a problem in your Perl code when a CGI program is   run.
501
Not   implemented
The   request cannot be executed by the server.
A server   problem.
502
Bad   gateway
The   server you're trying to reach is sending back errors.
A server   problem.
503
Service   unavailable
The   service or file that is being requested is not currently available.
A server   problem.
504
Gateway   timeout
The   gateway has timed out. This message is like the 408 timeout   error, but this one occurs at the gateway of the server.
Server is   down or nonresponsive.
505
HTTP   version not supported
The HTTP   protocol version that you want to use for communicating with the server is   not supported by it.
Server   does not support the HTTP version.
服务器不可用（错误代码503）可能有多种原因。以下示例是一个小办公室碰到的问题：员工能够访问Facebook，但当他们点击站点上的链接，则显示页面被拦截。以下截屏中，可看出页面被防火墙拦截：
工作原理:
标准的HTTP浏览模式如下：
TCP打开连接（三路握手信号）
HTTP发送GET命令
数据下载到浏览器
在一个网页打开多个连接的情况下（大多数网页都是如此）。每个连接需要一个DNS 查询，响应，TCP SYN-SYN/ACK-ACK，以及HTTP GET。之后数据才会出现在显示屏上。
当你在packet detail面板没有看到显示内容时，右键报文并选择Follow TCP stream，会看到连接的细节数据。另一个广泛应用的工具是Fiddler，Fiddler是HTTP故障排查的免费工具。
