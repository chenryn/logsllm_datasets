 **Juergen Hoeller** opened **SPR-5587** and commented
Spring 3.0 provides compatibility with Servlet 3.0 containers such as
GlassFish V3 already. Spring 3.1 (Q2 2011) is likely to provide optional
support for Servlet 3.0's multipart form handling (#11210), and possibly for
other Servlet 3.0 features that we can provide fallback solutions for as well.
Also to consider is support for Servlet 3.0 async processing in Spring MVC and
for Servlet 3.0 auto-registration in Spring's general web deployment.
