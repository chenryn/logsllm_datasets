When I run flutter doctor, "Android licenses not accepted. To resolve this,
run: flutter doctor --android-licenses" is the only thing it's cranky about.
When I run the command, and hit "y" to accept each license and rerun flutter
doctor, it still complains about the android licenses.
    flutter doctor -v

I posted the same thing on the Google groups for flutter, and it was suggested
this is a bug and that I should post it here.
