# What is RSS (Really Simple Syndication)?

Imagine a more open and user-controlled version of Twitter or Facebook's News Feed, free from manipulative algorithms, intrusive ads, and corporate ownership. Envision a newsletter system where your email isn't sold to spammers, and you don't have to navigate through complex unsubscribe processes. Now, picture that this already existed and was extremely popular 15 years ago, before we were lured into the walled gardens of social media.

It's time to return to a simpler, more user-empowering web experience with RSS.

# How Does RSS Work?

Unlike newsletters, where you share your email address with each publisher (who may abuse that trust), RSS operates on a "don't call me, I'll call you" principle. An RSS feed is a simple text file on a website, containing a list of posts without any tracking or personalization, much like a printed newspaper.

Using an RSS reader app of your choice, you can subscribe to specific feeds. The app will fetch updates from these feeds, and the websites cannot force content upon you. Your app then displays the posts in reverse chronological order, and some apps allow you to add extra filters, which you control. Additionally, the app enhances the formatting to make the posts more visually appealing.

Indeed, itâ€™s really simple!

# Getting Started with RSS

To begin, you need an RSS reader app. Popular options include Inoreader, Feedly, and The Old Reader. You can find a comprehensive list of RSS readers [here](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/).

Adding a feed to your app is straightforward: simply paste the link to the blog or website, and the app will automatically find and add the feed. RSS also allows you to follow creators on platforms like YouTube, Substack, and Medium.

# Tips for Using RSS Wisely

- **Avoid Hoarding:** Resist the urge to subscribe to too many feeds "just in case." This can quickly become overwhelming. Regularly review and unsubscribe from feeds that do not consistently enrich your life.
- **Full-Text Feeds Only:** Some feeds provide only excerpts, requiring you to click through to the full post. Avoid these, as they disrupt the reading experience and can lead to time-wasting on the original site.
- **Moderate Update Frequency:** Stick to feeds that update once a day or less. Opt for daily or weekly digests to keep your reading manageable.

# Why Did RSS Decline?

In 2013, Google discontinued Google Reader, the leading RSS reader at the time, to promote Google Plus, which ultimately failed. This move, along with the broader shift towards Web 2.0 platforms, contributed to the decline of RSS. Many users, including myself, found the new platforms more fun and convenient.

However, in recent years, social media has become less enjoyable and more intrusive. This has led to a renewed interest in RSS, which offers a more controlled and ad-free experience.

RSS did face two main challenges:
1. **Overwhelming Feeds:** The solution is to be selective and regularly prune your subscriptions.
2. **Revenue Model:** RSS supports text, link, and image ads but not the invasive, user-tracking ads. In 2013, this was a drawback, but today, subscription models like Patreon and Substack are thriving, making RSS a viable alternative again.

# Conclusion

By embracing RSS, you can escape the attention-draining, empathy-killing, and critical-thought-suffocating effects of algorithm-driven social media. Enjoy a cleaner inbox and a kinder, better web experience. 

Here's to a renaissance of a more user-friendly and ethical internet. ðŸ’–
