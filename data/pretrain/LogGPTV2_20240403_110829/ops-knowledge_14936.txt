User: In a large development team, how to effectively work together and manage code?
Assistant: The following are several effective collaborative work and code management methods: 1. Use version control tools: Use a version control tool (such as Git, SVN, etc.) to manage code, which allows team members to track each other's work progress and avoid code conflict and duplication of effort. 2. Follow consistent coding conventions: Develop consistent coding conventions and make sure all team members follow them. This can make the code easier to read, maintain and modify. 3. Use code review tools: Use code review tools (such as GitHub, GitLab, etc.) to check and verify code to ensure code quality and consistency. 4. Follow the agile development process: follow the agile development process, including story points and iteration planning. This helps team members better understand the overall project scope and schedule, and collaborate better. 5. Track tasks in project management tools: Use project management tools such as Jira, Trello, etc. to track and assign tasks. This helps team members understand their tasks and priorities, and plan and collaborate better. 6. Regular continuous integration: Continuous integration is an important process that automatically runs tests and builds after code commits. This helps team members detect and correct bugs, and keep code errors from making their way into the master branch. 7. Regular code refactoring: Regular code refactoring to maintain code quality and maintainability. This makes it easier for team members to modify and maintain the code, and makes the overall development process smoother.
