### 4. Effect of Device Hardware

The testing was conducted on four different smartphones. The overall success rate (TSR) for these devices generally remained at a reasonable level (80%). However, we observed a significant drop in TSR (to 50%) for one particular smartphone, likely due to its inferior hardware components. When the Meta-Enha method was used to train adversarial phrases, the TSR for this smartphone improved from 50% to approximately 65%. In the same setting, the TSR for the HTC smartphone even increased to around 100%. Conversely, both the iPhone and Samsung smartphone maintained consistently high TSR and CSR (Command Success Rate). These results demonstrate that Metamorph achieves robust performance on mid-range and high-end smartphones, while its performance degrades on low-end devices. Addressing this issue for low-end devices is a focus for future work.

### 5. Effect of Ambient Noise

Next, we examined the impact of ambient noise. The experimental setup was identical to the previous one, with the attacker's speaker playing adversarial examples at 75 dBSPL. We introduced background music as additional noise and evaluated system performance at different noise levels ranging from 35 dBSPL to 50 dBSPL, corresponding to SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) values from 40 to 25. As shown in Figure 19, Meta-Qual achieved consistently high TSR and CSR in environments with 35 dBSPL and 40 dBSPL noise floors (e.g., a quiet room). The TSR slightly decreased to 85% when the noise floor increased to 45 dBSPL (e.g., in a typical human conversation), and further dropped to around 60% at 50 dBSPL. On the other hand, the TSR for the Meta-Enha method remained high across all four noise floor settings. This indicates that Metamorph is robust to moderate ambient noise levels, particularly when the SNR is greater than 25.

### 6. Effect of Speaker Volume

We also varied the transmission power from 45 dBSPL to 75 dBSPL and evaluated system performance with an ambient noise level of 35 dBSPL. Figure 20 shows the performance of both Meta-Enha and Meta-Qual. At speaker volumes of 65 dBSPL and 75 dBSPL (SNR of 30 and 45, respectively), both TSR and CSR were nearly 100%. When the speaker volume was reduced to 55 dBSPL (SNR of 20), the attack performance slightly degraded, with the TSR of Meta-Enha dropping to 0.9 and the TSR of Meta-Qual to around 0.82. Further reducing the speaker volume to 45 dBSPL (SNR of 10) resulted in significantly lower attack success rates.

### 7. Effect of Victim Device Movement

Finally, we investigated the effectiveness of attacks when the victim device is moving, which is a natural and practical scenario. In this experiment, the attacker's speaker was placed on a table, and adversarial examples generated by Meta-Qual and Meta-Enha were played. The victim device was held in hand and moved towards and away from the table at different but relatively constant speeds (0.1 m/s, 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s, and 1.5 m/s). The results, shown in Figure 21, indicate that the CSR for Meta-Qual remained consistently high (>90%) at both low (0.5 m/s) and normal (1.5 m/s) speeds. The TSR for Meta-Qual, however, decreased slightly at 1.5 m/s. Both CSR and TSR for Meta-Enha were around 100% across all four speed settings. This demonstrates that both versions of Metamorph are robust to the victim’s normal movement.

#### Audio Adversarial Examples

Early studies [50] revealed the possibility of conducting adversarial attacks on speech recognition (SR) systems, though the generated adversarial examples were easily perceptible to humans [46]. Alzantot et al. [14] later developed an attack on a command word recognition model without the listener's perception. Motivated by [14], Taori et al. [49] extended the attack to DeepSpeech [27], but their recognized commands were limited to two words [56]. Carlini et al. [16] then realized an attack on general HMM-based RS systems without constraints on the number of words, and later introduced a targeted audio adversarial attack on DeepSpeech [17]. Liu et al. [36] proposed a weighted-sampling method to reduce the search space, while Qin et al. [42] introduced frequency masking algorithms to improve the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks. Felix et al. [33] designed adversarial examples to attack voice authentication systems, and Moustapha et al. [18] proposed a general adversarial example generation method for gradient-based machine learning models. Some works leveraged evolutionary algorithms for black-box attacks [43, 47], but the generated adversarial examples could not survive over-the-air transmission. Subsequent research aimed to make these attacks work in real-world scenarios (see Table 3). Yuan et al. [57] integrated commands into songs, and Abdullah et al. [12] used similar frequency domain feature vectors from multiple source audios to generate adversarial examples that could succeed after over-the-air transmission. Yakura et al. [56] further proposed injecting CIR collected at other places into the training model, achieving decent success rates, but their work was primarily effective in short ranges (0.3 m to 1 m) and required the physical presence of attack devices.

#### Embedding Bits into Audio

In the literature, there are existing works that propose embedding bits into audio for various applications. For example, Dhwani [38] uses acoustic signals for secure near-field communication, while GeneWave [54] proposes an efficient authentication design for mobile devices. Another study [58] introduces a secure communication design without using keys. These works focus on security-related applications. Other prior works have proposed more general methods to embed bits into sounds for side-channel information delivery [35, 40, 52], typically embedding bits in the high-frequency band (18 kHz – 20 kHz) to minimize human perception. In contrast, audio adversarial examples, including those generated by Metamorph and prior attacks, add bits in the audible range (0 kHz – 8 kHz) because SR systems primarily use this range for recognition. Therefore, maintaining audio quality is a crucial consideration in the generation of adversarial examples.

#### Microphone Non-linearity

Recent studies, such as [44, 45, 59], have successfully realized inaudible attacks on speech recognition by exploiting the non-linearities of microphone diaphragms and receiver power amplifiers [44]. These attacks can inject sneaky voice commands into the victim's speech recognition system without the owner's awareness. However, these inaudible attacks require special speaker hardware to play ultrasonic acoustic signals, adding extra hardware requirements. Moreover, they have been successfully defended against [45]. These works do not fall under the category of adversarial attacks and do not address the unique challenges faced by Metamorph.

#### Assorted Topics Related to Metamorph

There are other types of adversarial examples, with image-based ones being the most representative [15, 34]. For image adversarial example generation, a similar problem exists: whether the adversarial images can survive when captured by a camera. RP2 [20] reported a successful attack by considering the varying distances and angles between the camera and the adversarial image in the perturbation training. However, the technical challenges in acoustic channels differ from those in image-based adversarial attacks. To improve the attacking distance, we utilized domain discriminator training methods [29, 60]. Inspired by these works, we proposed a dedicated domain discriminator to exclude device- and environment-dependent features from the prior measurements in the training of adversarial example perturbations.

### VI. Conclusion

This paper presents Metamorph, a system for generating over-the-air audio adversarial examples. We conducted extensive empirical studies to understand the attack in over-the-air settings and observed that the primary challenge is the frequency-selectivity caused by both the device and channel. To address this, we proposed a "generate-and-clean" two-phase design and considered the audio quality of the generated adversarial examples. The evaluation shows the efficacy and good performance of Metamorph.
