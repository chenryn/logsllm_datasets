**ATT&CK Technique Name: Hooking**

Adversaries may employ hooking techniques to intercept and redirect calls to application programming interface (API) functions, often for the purpose of execution and privilege escalation. Windows processes frequently use these API functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources. These API functions are typically stored as exported functions within dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). By hooking into these functions, adversaries can manipulate or monitor the behavior of legitimate processes, potentially gaining elevated privileges or executing malicious code.
