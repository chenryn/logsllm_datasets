## ❓ Questions & Help
When using En-Fr XLMModel in transformers library,  
I found that result from tokenizing a whole sentence is different from
tokenizing words in the sentence and then concatenate.
My configuration is as below  
**(XLMModel, XLMTokenizer, XLMConfig, 'xlm-mlm-enfr-1024')**
The result is as below

The ultimate goal is to 'detokenize' tokenized sentence which is  
['I', 'love', 'swim', '##ing'] -> ['I', 'love', 'swimming']  
In order to do this, I have to know the raw token's index for each tokenized
tokens.
It would be great if anyone can help with this problem.
