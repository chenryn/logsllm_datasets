User: When I use gdb to debug my C++ program with segmentation fault, I come with this error in gdb. 

Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "/usr/share/gdb/auto-load/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-  gnu/libstdc++.so.6.0.19-gdb.py", line 63, in 
      from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
  ImportError: No module named 'libstdcxx'

I am using Gdb 7.7.1 and g++ version 4.8.4. I have googled around but haven't get answers. Can any one solve my error? Thank you very much.
Assistant: If you used sudo to start the gdb, make sure you have the PATH correct.
Try this sudo PATH=$PATH gdb ...
