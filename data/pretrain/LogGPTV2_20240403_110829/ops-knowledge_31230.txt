I understand that you encountered an issue with WingIDE not recognizing the newly installed Python 3.2, and instead, it was showing the older Python 2.6.1. However, it seems that the problem resolved itself when you launched WingIDE again, and it now correctly identifies Python 3.2 as the active version. 

Nevertheless, you mentioned that the terminal still only recognizes Python 2.6. If you want to run your Python scripts using Python 3.2 via the command line, you can do so by specifying `python3.2` followed by the name of your script, like this:

```bash
python3.2 ./filename.py
```

This will ensure that your script is executed using the Python 3.2 interpreter.
