User: I installed python 3.2 edition, but when I opened wingIDE, my MAC still only show the old edition phthon 2.6.1. I tried to use "configure python"-enter python3.2 in "python executable", then found nothing changed, python 2.6.1 still appeared in wingIDE. Any suggestion?

I just tried to launch WINGIDE again and this time it indicates the python 3.2, the newest edition i installed. hmmmm, funny, i didn't change anything and it recognized it now! But when i use terminal, it still only recognize python 2.6.
Assistant: trying to fix wing myself, but if you want to just execute it via commandline...
in terminal:
python3.2 ./filename.py
enjoy
