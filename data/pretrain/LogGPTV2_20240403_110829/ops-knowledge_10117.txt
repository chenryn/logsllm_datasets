To make your `.pdbrc` file, which contains debugging aliases, available globally on a Windows system, you should place it in the following directory:

```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.pdbrc
```

Replace `<YourUsername>` with your actual Windows username. This location ensures that the file is accessible system-wide when using the Python debugger (PDB).
