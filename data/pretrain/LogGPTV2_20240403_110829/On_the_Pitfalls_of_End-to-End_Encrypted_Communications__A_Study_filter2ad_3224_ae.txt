### A.4 Statistical Analysis of Remote vs. Proximity Setting

The non-parametric Friedman test followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction was conducted to compare the error rates and the user perception among different code verification methods in remote and proximity settings. The results are summarized in Table 5.
