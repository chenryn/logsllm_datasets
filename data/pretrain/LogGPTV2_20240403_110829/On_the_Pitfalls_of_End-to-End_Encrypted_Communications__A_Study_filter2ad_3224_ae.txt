A.4 Statistical Analysis of Remote vs.
Proximity Setting
The non-parametric Friedman test followed by the Wilcoxon signed-
rank test with Bonferroni correction was conducted to compare
the error rates and the user perception among different code veri-
fication methods in remote and proximity setting. The results are
summarized in Table 5.
