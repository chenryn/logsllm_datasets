While creating a distplot on 'Tips' dataset on 'Total_Bills' column the Y axis
values in the chart appear in decimal while I am expecting it to provide the
counts.
I am using the following code:
`import seaborn as sns %matplotlib inline tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
sns.distplot(tips['total_bill'],bins=10,norm_hist=False)`
which gives following output:

while I am expecting the y axis to show the values as per below.

Following Troubleshooting steps were performed:
  1. Restart Kernel and Run All Cells
  2. Copy the entire code in One Cell
  3. Open a new Jupyter Notebook to wrote the code again.
  4. Explicitly mentioned norm_hist = False in the argument
But none of these work. Why by default does it show values like 0.01, 0.02,
0.03 .... 0.06 on the y-axis?
