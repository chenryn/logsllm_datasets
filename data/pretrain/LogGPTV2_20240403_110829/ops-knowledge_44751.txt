User: I have installed the new python release and would like to run .py files from the terminal.
How is this done from the terminal? I dont want to include the path in each command to run a .py file.
Assistant: Have a look at the Python package under Applications. There is a shell script there called Update Shell Profile.command
Run this and it should set your path up properly.
Unless you mark you script as executable with chmod +x, you'll need to run python over it first. e.g. `python myscript.py'
