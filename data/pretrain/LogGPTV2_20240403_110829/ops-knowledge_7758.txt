User: I want to run a process (a python program) on a remote machine. I have both Canopy and Anaconda installed. 
After I SSH into the remote machine, if I type 'python', I get the python prompt - the Canopy version.
If I type 'screen', hit 'enter', then type 'python', I get the python prompt - the Anaconda version.
I want to use the Canopy version when I'm in 'screen'. How can I do so?
Assistant: Solved! Here's how:
1) In terminal, after SSHing into the remote machine, type 'which python' (thanks @furas!). This gives path/to/Canopy/python
2) In terminal, type 'screen path/to/Canopy/python program.py' to run the desired program (called program.py) in the Canopy version of python.
