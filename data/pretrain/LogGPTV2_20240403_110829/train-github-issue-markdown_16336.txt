in the latest version of source-to-image we had to bump the docker engine-api
to resolve a bug,  
see this: openshift/source-to-image#612 (comment)  
wanted to kick the conversation about bumping it here so we can bump it in
origin. i already looked into it and it seems that the docker team also broke
API compatibility by removing some fields from the types.go so now, cadvsior
needs to be bumped to solve that (and who knows what else). not to mention
that they also deprecated the docker engine-api altogether.
@mfojtik @kargakis what do you guys think?
