runtime (over all permission events where we recorded both
install-time and runtime expectations) was 25% (1,233/4,892)
demonstrating that users sometimes revise their expectations
as a result of additional context acquired through use and in-
teraction with an app. The deny rate for permissions expected
at runtime was 12.2% whereas the deny rate for runtime unex-
pected permission requests was 26.9%. This ∼15% difference
in deny rates is 3× larger than the ∼4% discrepancy observed
for install-time expectations—participants are 2× more likely
to deny permission requests they did not expect at runtime
than at install-time. Figure 3 shows that the deny rate for unex-
pected permission requests is roughly double that of expected
requests, across all the permission types. In the case of the
Phone permission, the deny rate tripled, going from 9% to
27%. The ensemble of these observations shows that expecta-
tions do inﬂuence participant behavior, and also suggests that
better understanding and more accurate expectations gained
through context cause users to grant permissions.
Similar to our assessment of the inﬂuence of install-time
expectations, we check if the participants’ run-time expec-
tations affect their permission decisions via a mixed effects
logistic regression analysis. We again modeled run-time ex-
pectation as a categorical feature with three levels – Yes, No
and Not Surveyed; and used Yes as the reference level. We
modeled run-time expectation as the independent feature and
the permission decision (recall, ‘1’ represents a deny) as the
dependent feature. Similar to the earlier analysis, we include
the permission type as a ﬁxed effect and the participant and
app as random effects. The trained model shows a signiﬁcant
difference between expecting and not expecting a permission
at run-time (β = 1.21, p-value = < 2e− 16 for No categorical
response). An ANOVA test between this model and a base
model differing in only the run-time expectation categorical
feature has shown that including the run-time expectation
did lead to a better model ﬁt (p-value = < 2.2e− 16). These
results indicate that an unexpected permission at run time
makes it more likely to be denied. Our ﬁndings corroborate
the ﬁndings in [48], although as pointed out in Section 2, our
study mechanisms are quite different and our study size here
is two orders of magnitude larger.
5.4 Cross Country Analysis
We now look at behaviors according to country and regional
differences. We acknowledge that understanding country to
country comparisons is challenging as it is not possible to
control for all factors inﬂuencing such comparisons. Cultural

values [3, 7, 27] and regulatory frameworks [33] are consid-
ered macro-environmental factors that have been shown to
inﬂuence users’ privacy concerns and their behavior in re-
sponse to data requests. One aspect of culture, namely indi-
vidualism versus collectivism, has been demonstrated [30]
to inﬂuence self-disclosure. Views towards government [8]
also inﬂuence privacy attitudes. A study of 7 European coun-
tries [27] showed how local culture inﬂuences privacy atti-
tudes and stated behavior, while [7] made similar observations
for large cities in 4 Asian countries. Studying cultural issues is
complex in part because privacy attitudes are evolving world-
wide [14]. For example, [14] reports that differences across
25 countries, in terms of how important privacy is, are mi-
nor. However, views about how privacy will improve over
the next decade are signiﬁcantly different across countries.
While all of these factors may inﬂuence participant behavior,
we could only control for the gender of our participants, and
thus exogenous factors, such as Android phone popularity,
and the economic value of $10 within a country, may bias the
set of participants in our survey. While we may refer to the
participants by the country they are from, we acknowledge -
as a result of the above limitations - that we can only make
observations about the participants in our study, and that dis-
ambiguating the effect of a country’s culture from the other
mentioned factors is beyond the scope of this paper.
Our cross country comparison includes 9 countries (recall
that we leave Hong Kong out here since we were unable to
recruit at least 50 female participants). Table 2 shows the deny
rates across different countries, as well as (for completeness),
gender and education. The aggregate deny rate per country
varies from 12% for the United States to 25% for Argentina.
It is noteworthy that some regions (Argentina and Spain) have
deny rates that were twice as high as other regions (the US and
India). However this aggregate deny rate may hide variation
among participants within countries.
We perform country pairwise ANOVA tests to determine
if the participants from two countries are drawn from popu-
lations with the same mean deny rates. After doing this for
all pairs of countries, we identiﬁed 2 distinct cliques of coun-
tries; for all pairs within the same clique, the null hypothesis
holds, indicating that the countries within a clique are similar
with respect to their means. However for all pairs of countries
from different cliques, the null hypothesis is rejected indi-
cating that their populations have different mean deny rates.
The US, India and South Africa formed one clique and these
3 countries have an average deny rate of 13.07%. Canada,
Argentina, Spain and France belong to the second group with
an average deny rate of 21.65%. Singapore and the UK did
not ﬁt cleanly into either clique. For example, although the
UK was statistically similar to both France and South Africa,
it differed from both the US and Spain.
Figure 5 presents the deny rates for individual permissions
by country. We see that the permission type that a popula-
tion is most sensitive too (highest deny rate) varies across
countries. For example, Microphone is the most frequently
denied permission in 5 countries, Calendar is the top denied
permission in 3 countries, and Location has the highest deny
rate only in Spain. Within individual countries, we see certain
permissions are more vigorously denied than others (e.g. the
French deny Calendar twice as often as Camera).
5.5 Factors Inﬂuencing Deny Rate
In Section 5.3, we used mixed effects logistic regression to
study the inﬂuence of a single factor on the permission deci-
sion. In this section, we now build a larger model, that helps
determine the inﬂuence of each of the dozen factors collected
in the study while controlling for other factors. Similar to
the earlier exercises, we consider permission decision as the
binary response variable (‘1’ represents a deny and ‘0’ an ac-
cept), and include the participant and app as random effects.
We consider the following factors. Each participant in our
study was required to answer an exit survey that measured
their privacy attitudes along the 4 dimensions of Control,
Awareness, Collection and Secondary use of private informa-
tion, as described in Section 4.2. Based on their responses
to these questions, participants are assigned a score on a
scale between [−2,2] in each dimension, with positive scores
indicating higher sensitivity to privacy loss in that dimen-
sion. We included these four privacy dimensional scores (con-
trol, awareness, collection and secondary_use) as quantitative
variables. The presence/absence of a permission explanation
string (has_explanation) and the permission change happen-
ing from the settings menu (settings_menu) are included as
binary variables. The rest of the 6 variables are included as
categorical variables with reference levels. The reference lev-
els were selected randomly to prevent any bias: “US” for
country, “Bachelor´s degree (e.g. BA, BS) or higher” for ed-
ucation, “Male” for gender, “Below 30” years for age, “Lo-
cation” for permission, and “Yes” for runtime_expected. We
include all the users who answered demographic questions
and their permission decision events in this analysis, and not
just the surveyed ones. For the unsurveyed decisions, the run-
time_expected variable is speciﬁed as ‘Not Surveyed’. Some
of the categorical levels for age and education have been
merged to account for low response volumes, and rows cor-
responding to ‘Other’ and ‘Prefer not to say’ in the gender
category have been excluded from the analysis.
We performed Variance-Inﬂation Factors (VIF) analysis to
check for multicollinearity among the 12 chosen variables.
VIF measures how much the variance of any one of the coefﬁ-
cients is inﬂated due to multicollinearity in the overall model.
VIF values above 5 are considered problematic. All of our 12
variables have VIF values below 5. In fact, almost all of the
variables have values close to 1, except for the four privacy
dimensional scores which have scores close to 4. Overall this
indicates that participant demographics, their privacy attitudes,
expectations, country as well as explanations and permission

types all play a role in permission denial decisions.
The results of the mixed effect logistic regression analysis
with all the 12 variables and the random effects is shown in
Table 3. Each row contains a factor, its accepted values, the
identiﬁed β coefﬁcient value indicating directional change in
the permission deny rates with respect to the baseline of the
given factor, and the p-value indicating statistical signiﬁcance.
Many of the factors have statistical signiﬁcance with p-values
< 0.001. The model has a conditional R2 value of 0.576. The
intraclass correlation coefﬁcient (ICC) for the user random
effect is 0.256 and for the app random effect is 0.271, indicat-
ing that the permission decisions from a particular user or app
are not strongly correlated with other decisions from the same
user or app. The table corroborates a number of our earlier
ﬁndings. In Table 2 we reported higher average deny rates for
women than men. With our current larger regression model,
we see that females are more likely to deny a permission (β =
0.299) compared to the reference male category, when con-
trolling for other variables. Section 5.3.1 indicated that the
presence of an explanation reduces the deny rate. Our larger
regression model again shows that providing a permission
explanation string makes it less likely to deny the request (β
= -0.725) when compared to the case where there is no expla-
nation. Section 5.3.1 showed statistical signiﬁcance between
runtime expectations and the denial rate. The current larger
model again shows that an unexpected runtime permission is
more likely to be denied (β = 1.216), even when controlling
for other factors. These results strengthen our earlier ﬁndings,
as they remain true even when controlling for other variables.
Table 3 also provides additional insights. Controlling for
other variables, a permission change happening from the set-
tings menu is more likely to denied (β = 2.04). Looking at
the privacy scores, users with higher sensitivity across collec-
tion (β = 0.404) dimension are more likely to deny requests,
and those with higher sensitivity across secondary use (β =
-0.264) are less likely to deny. When we look at the inﬂuence
of a country in our data, compared to a user in the US, those
coming from Argentina, Canada, Spain, France, UK and Sin-
gapore are more likely to deny a permission. India and South
Africa don’t exhibit statistical signiﬁcant difference compared
to the reference country US, perhaps because they are both
in the same clique (see Section 5.4). We tested other models
using different references countries (e.g. Argentina, France)
and in those models, India does exhibit statistically signiﬁcant
different behavior. This shows that country plays an important
role in permission decisions.
Users with less than high school diploma education level
are less likely to deny permissions compared to those with
a Bachelor’s or higher degree. This ﬁnding indicates that ed-
ucation level does have an inﬂuence on a user’s permission
choices. When comparing across different permission types,
our model shows that Android users’ behavior does vary by
permission. We see that Contacts and Microphone are gener-
ally denied more often than Location—even when controlling
for a multiplicity of factors. Overall participants deny Storage
less often than any other permission.
We explored whether permissions are treated differently in
different countries by training a second mixed effect logistic
regression model of permission deny rates with the ‘coun-
try:permission’ interaction effect. An ANOVA test between
this model and the earlier model without the interaction term
shows that the second model has better ﬁt (p-value = 8.8e-13).
This demonstrates there is an interplay between how different
permissions are perceived across countries.
From this second model, we observe that some coun-
try:permission interaction variables diverge signiﬁcantly (p-
value < 0.05) from overall country patterns. For example, our
Spanish participants generally deny permissions more com-
pared to those in the US, yet they deny individual permissions
such as Camera, Contacts, Microphone, and Storage less com-
pared to the US. Similarly our Argentinian participants deny
more than their US counterparts, but have lower denial rates
for Contacts and Microphone. In conclusion, it is interesting
to note that there are not just a couple of factors that inﬂuence
a user’s permission decision, and the ﬁnal observed decision
is a combined effect of many factors put together.
