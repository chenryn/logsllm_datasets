This is a bit of a weird one cropping up under very particular circumstances,
but I spent a while last week puzzling over the issue. Probably best explained
through the example.

### Expected Behavior
Entering "Todd" into the form field in this simple example app and submitting
the form takes the user to /hello/Todd, just like clicking the "Click here if
your name is Todd" link does.
    from flask import Flask, redirect, request, url_for
    app = Flask(__name__)
    @app.route("/")
    def form():
        return """
            Click here if your name is Todd
                This is my name!
        """.format(
            url_for("hello", name="Todd"),
            url_for("hello")
        )
    @app.route("/hello", methods=["GET", "POST"])
    @app.route("/hello/")
    def hello(name=None):
        if request.method == "POST":
            return redirect(url_for("hello", name=request.form.get("name")))
        if name:
            return "Hello {}!".format(name)
        else:
            return "Hello World!"
### Actual Behavior
Submitting the form instead takes you to /hello?name=Todd.
Through my own testing I've concluded that `url_for("hello", name="Todd")`
will return `/hello?name=Todd` if
  * we are currently processing a POST request, _and_
  * the target endpoint has a parameter-less route with the POST method allowed (`/hello`), _but_ the route we actually want (`/hello/`) only allows GET requests.
This seems obviously bizarre and counterintuitive.
### Environment
  * Python version: 3.6.4
  * Flask version: 0.12.2
  * Werkzeug version: 0.13
