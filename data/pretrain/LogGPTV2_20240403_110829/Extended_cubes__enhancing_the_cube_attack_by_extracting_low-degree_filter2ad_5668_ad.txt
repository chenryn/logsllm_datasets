state is moved to bit position P (i).
The di(cid:11)erence between the 80-bit key and the 128-bit key
variants of PRESENT is on the key schedule.
For the 80-bit key variant, the user-supplied key that is
stored in key register K is represented as k79k78 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k0. The
64-bit round key Ki = κ63κ62 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) κ0 consists of the leftmost
bits of the current contents (i.e. at round i) of register K.
Thus the round key at round i can be depicted as:
Ki = κ63κ62 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) κ0 = k79k78 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k16
For each round i, after applying addRoundKey, the key reg-
ister K is updated as in the following steps:
1. [k79k78 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k1k0] = [k18k17 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k20k19]
2. [k79k78k77k76] = S[k79k78k77k76]
3. [k19k18k17k16k15] = [k19k18k17k16k15](cid:8)round_counter
For the 128-bit key variant, the user supplied key that
stored in a key register K is represented as k127k126 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k0.
Similarly, the 64-bit round key Ki = κ63κ62 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) κ0 consists
of the leftmost bits of the current contents (i.e. at round i)
of register K. Thus the round key at round i for 128-bit key
variant can be depicted as:
Ki = κ63κ62 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) κ0 = k127k126 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k64
After applying addRoundKey in each round, the key register
K is updated as in the following steps:
1. [k127k126 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k1k0] = [k66k65 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k68k67]
2. [k127k126k125k124] = S[k127k126k125k124]
3. [k123k122k121k120] = S[k123k122k121k120]
4. [k66k65k64k63k62] = [k66k65k64k63k62](cid:8)round_counter

In this section, we explain our side channel cube attack a-
gainst PRESENT using the Hamming weight leakage model
and our extended cube method.
Hamming Weight. Let B = bβ(cid:0)1 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) b0 be the binary string
of length β bits, representing the internal state of the cipher.
The Hamming weight of B is the number of bits with value
1 in the binary representation of B, which can be comput-
β(cid:0)1
ed as HW (B) =
j=0 bj and has a value between 0 and
β. Clearly, the Hamming weight can also be viewed as a
boolean vector mapping HW : f0, 1gb ! f0, 1gxlog2 by+1,
where the (cid:12)rst bit of HW (B), i.e. the least signi(cid:12)cant bit
(LSB), is the XOR of all bits from B; the MSB of HW (B)
is the AND of all bits from B; and each bit in between is a
boolean function whose degree increases as the bit position
gets closer to the MSB.
5.1 Application to the PRESENT Block
Cipher
The di(cid:11)erence between the two variants of PRESENT is
in the key schedule algorithm as described in Sec. 4. Note
that, at each round i the addition of the round key ki to
the internal state using addRoundKey is performed before
updating the key register K. Therefore, the (cid:12)rst 64 bits of
the secret key for both variants (i.e. k79 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k16 for the 80-bit
key variant PRESENT-80 and k127 (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) k64 for the 128-bit key
variant PRESENT-128) are applied directly to the internal
state at the (cid:12)rst round. Hence, both variants are equally
susceptible to any attack that can recover the (cid:12)rst 64 bits
of the secret key, e.g. by considering the Hamming weight
leakage after the (cid:12)rst round as is the case for our attack.
Assuming access to the value of the Hamming weight of
the internal state after the (cid:12)rst round, which can be repre-
sented as a byte, we consider all bits starting from the LSB
position towards the MSB position (of the 8-bit binary repre-
sentation of the Hamming weight). To search for maxterms,
we use various cube sizes which increase as we consider more
bits towards the MSB. We follow the technique which is a
variant of the random walk [20] as used also in [16] to (cid:12)nd
the implicit degree d of the master polynomial p. Knowing
the degree d of the master polynomial enables us to (cid:12)nd
the maxterms easily, as the maxterms are expected to be
found when we choose the cube of size s = d (cid:0) 1. To know
whether a particular selected monomial tI is a maxterm,
we apply the BLR test by choosing 100 pairs of vectors x,
y 2 f0, 1gn (where n is the length of the secret key which
is either 80 for PRESENT-80 or 128 for PRESENT-128),
and verify tI as a maxterm only if all the 100 pair of vec-
tors (x, y) satisfy relation (2). The linear equation is then
derived by (cid:12)nding all terms within the equation. To (cid:12)nd
whether a secret variable ki is a term of the linear equation,
pjw will change
we check whether the value of pI =
if we change the value of ki to either 0 or 1, while setting all
other variables (i.e. secret and public variables) which are
not in the monomial tI to (cid:12)xed values. If changing the value
of the secret variable ki changes the value of pI , one can tell
that ki is a term in the linear equation. To check whether a
constant term exists in the equation, we set all the variables
not in the monomial tI to zero and compute pI and check if
it is equal to 1 that indicates the existence of the constant
term in the equation.

We ran our simulation for several weeks to (cid:12)nd maxterms;
i.e., tI s with \linear" superpoly. However, it was not possible
to (cid:12)nd enough linearly independent equations. Then, using
the extended cube method, we continued (cid:12)nding some ad-
ditional quadratic equations. To do this we chose the cube
of size s = d (cid:0) 2. This time, to know whether a particular
monomial tI which we select has a superpoly pS(I) of degree
2, we apply the generalized BLR test (cf. Sec. 3.1) by select-
ing 100 samples of vectors x, y, z 2 f0, 1gn and verify that
pS(I) is of degree at most 2 only if all the 100 samples of
vectors x, y, z satisfy relation (4). The quadratic equation
is then derived using two steps. First, we (cid:12)nd the secret
