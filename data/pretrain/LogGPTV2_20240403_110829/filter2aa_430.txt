# Lockpicking Forensics
## Defcon 17, 2009

### Agenda
- How locks and picks work
- Normal wear
- Lock analysis
- Key analysis
- Investigative process

### Introduction
- Destructive entry remains the most common method of unauthorized access.

### How Locks Work
- **Pin Binding:**
  - When a key is inserted, the pins align at the shear line, allowing the plug to rotate.
- **Picking a Lock:**
  - Apply tension to the lock.
  - Find the binding pin.
  - Raise the pin to the shear line.
  - Repeat until all pins are set.

### Forensic Locksmithing
- **Historical Context:**
  - 1976: Art Paholke, Chicago PD
  - "Locks, Safes, Security" by Tobias
  - "Werkzeugspur" by Goth
  - Impressioning techniques by Diederichsen
- **Key Responsibilities:**
  - Determine the method of entry.
  - Identify evidence, tool marks, and techniques.
  - Provide expert testimony.

### Wear Analysis
- **New Components:**
  - Pins, key, and plug show minimal wear.
- **After 100 Uses:**
  - Pins, key, and plug show slight wear.
- **After 1,500 Uses:**
  - Pins (pin 1 and pin 5), key, and plug show moderate wear.
- **After 5,000 Uses:**
  - Pins (pin 1 and pin 5), key, and plug show significant wear.

### Forensic Analysis
- **Components:**
  - Pins, springs, plug, cylinder, cam/actuator, keys, bolt, door, window, wall, etc.
- **Lockpicking:**
  - Focus on pins, plug, tension, and cam.
- **Pick Guns:**
  - Analyze pins and cam.
- **Key Bumping:**
  - Examine pins and plug.
- **Impressioning:**
  - Manipulation, plug, and UV residue.
- **Decoding:**
  - Techniques include covert vs. surreptitious, decoder pick, manipulation, visual/optical, thermal, radiological, and disassembly.
  - **Visual Decoding:**
    - Detailed visual inspection.

### Bypass Techniques
- Various methods for bypassing locks.

### Key Analysis
- **Material, Keyway, Cuts, and Codes:**
  - Original or duplicate.
  - Hand cut or machined.
  - Recent cutting or copying.
  - Material transfer.
- **Plating:**
  - Original vs. copied.
  - Stylus striae.
  - Hand-made and filed keys.
  - Use of cutting wheels.
  - Comparison of keys.
  - Tool marks and residues (clay, wax, UV).

### Anti-forensics Tools
- Possible but difficult to use.
- Limited durability and expensive.

### Safe/Vault Forensics
- Drill points, writing/marking, magnetic/adhesive, and tool marks.

### Investigative Process
- **Crime Scene Investigation:**
  - Photographs, sketches, permission issues, evidence preservation, chain of custody, and police vs. insurance considerations.
- **Initial Questions:**
  - Purchase/installation, daily usage, security ratings, key/combo distribution, lock condition (working, repaired, replaced).
- **Forensic Examination:**
  - Lock specifications, operation, security rating, tool marks, material transfer, and key analysis.
  - Do your homework!
- **Disassembly:**
  - Chamber casings, use of keys, shimming, and destructive methods.
- **Shimming:**
  - Detailed examination.

### Forensic Workspaces
- Separate clean area with new tools (tweezers, followers, shims, saws, clay, hands, etc.).

### Cleaning of Components
- Consider whether to clean components.
- Always look first to avoid evidence destruction or false evidence creation.

### Investigative Report
- **Findings:**
  - Supporting pictures.
  - Mirrored locks (picked, pick gun, bumped, impressioned).

### Licensing & Certification
- International Association of Investigative Locksmiths (IAIL)
