User: I'm running Windows and the shell/OS automatically runs Python based on the registry settings when you run a program on the command line. Will this break if I install a 2.x and 3.x version of Python on the same machine?
I want to play with Python 3 while still being able to run 2.x scripts on the same machine.
Assistant: I am just starting out with python now. I'm reading Zed Shaw's book "Learn Python the Hard Way" which requires python version 2.x but am also taking a class that requires python 3.x
So here is what I did. 

Download python 2.7
run power shell (should already be installed on windows)
run python IN POWERSHELL (if it doesn't recognize then go to step 4)
Only if powershell doesn't recognize python 2.7 type in the following: 

"[ENVIRONMENT]::SETENVIRONMENTVARIABLE("PATH", "$ENV:PATH;C:\PYTHON27", "USER")"
(no outside quotes)

Now type python and you should see it say python 2.7 blah blah blah

NOW for python 3.x
Simple, python 3.x download comes with python for windows app. SO simply pin the Python for Windows app to your task bar, or create shortcut to the desktop and you are done!
Open Python for Windows for 3.x
Open Powershell for python 2.x
I hope this helps!
