I'm trying to highlight the current item in my menu by checking the
Router.pathname but I'm getting the error
    No router instance found. You should only use "next/router" inside the client side of your app.
    Error: No router instance found.

When I remove the code and add it after my page has loaded the code is
working(with HMR). However, when I refresh the page it gives me that error.
To reproduce:
    import Router from 'next/router'
    export default () => (
        {JSON.stringify(Router.pathname)}
    )
Using next `2.1.1`
