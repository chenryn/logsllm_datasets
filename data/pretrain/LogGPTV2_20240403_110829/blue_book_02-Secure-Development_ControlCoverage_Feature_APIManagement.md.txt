APIManagementDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomated
All users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesMetric alert rules must be configured for critical actions on API Management serviceMetric alert for occurrence of unauthorized gateway requests help the admin to identify security breach attempts.MediumYesDiagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 daysLogs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.MediumYesBackend API must only be accessible over HTTPS via API Management serviceUse of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer eavesdropping attacks.HighYesAPI Management service instance should be backed up periodicallyThe service 'backup and restore' feature provides facility to recover from availability problems affecting the region where your API Management service is hosted.MediumNo'Named Values' that contain sensitive data must be encrypted by marking as 'secret'Encrypted 'Named Values' are stored securely by the Azure platform.HighYesEnsure that only the most secure and up to date version of TLS is enabled on the API gatewayTLS 1.2 is the latest and most secure protocol. Using 3DES Ciphers, TLS protocols (1.1 and 1.0) and SSL 3.0 exposes the API to meet-in-the-middle attack, chosen-plaintext or known-plaintext attacks.HighNoDelete the two sample products 'Starter' and 'Unlimited' to avoid accidental exposure of APIsBy default, each API Management instance comes with two sample products: Starter and Unlimited. Unless the access control of these sample products is being strictly regulated, associating APIs to these products stands the chance of exposing APIs to unauthenticated users.MediumYesAny header containing sensitive data such as authorization token should not be logged in Application InsightsAPIM provides an option to log request and response headers in Application Insights. Any header containing sensitive data such as authorization token should not be logged. This minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and also helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.MediumYesEnsure that CORS access is granted to a minimal set of trusted origins and only required verbs are supportedCORS enables an operation or an API to allow cross-domain calls from browser-based clients. Using '*' (allow all) for CORS setting means that all cross-origin requests are allowed. Restricting allowed origins to the specific set that needs access aligns with the principle of least privilege.MediumYesIf delegated authentication is enabled, ensure that it is implemented securelyDelegation allows you to use your existing website for handling developer sign-in/sign-up and subscription to products as opposed to using the built-in functionality in the developer portal. It is the API publisher's responsibility to ensure protection of user data.HighYesConsider hosting APIM within a virtual network for improved isolationAzure Virtual Network (VNet) deployment provides enhanced security and isolation for API management instance, as well as backend service, access control policies, and other features to further restrict access.MediumYesCustom domain with SSL binding must be configured for Proxy and Portal endpoints of Azure API Management instanceUse of custom domain protects a backend service from common attacks such as phishing, session hijacking and other DNS-related attacks.MediumNoEnsure that JWT validation is enabled if using OAuth 2.0 or OpenID connectIf 'validate-jwt' policy is not configured, client can call the API without the OAuth/OpenID connect authorization token. This policy enforces existence and validity of a JWT extracted from either a specified HTTP Header or a specified query parameter.HighYesUse Restrict caller IPs policies for additional protectionUsing the IP filter policy feature ensures that access to the backend service is restricted to a specific set/group of clients. While this may not be feasible in all scenarios, when it can be used, it provides an extra layer of access control protection for critical assets.MediumYesDo not use API Management REST APIThe credentials used to access API Management REST API provide admin-level access without support for role-based access control and without recording audit logs. For better security it is recommended to make calls through the ARM-based REST APIHighYesEnsure that either OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect are used to authorize developer accounts in API ManagementEnabling OAuth/OpenID connect user authorization ensure that only valid users have access, and they can only access resources to which they are entitled.HighYesEnterprise applications using APIM must authenticate developers/applications using Azure Active Directory backed credentialsUsing the native enterprise directory for authentication ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control. All Enterprise subscriptions are automatically associated with their enterprise directory (xxx.onmicrosoft.com) and users in the native directory are trusted for authentication to enterprise subscriptions.HighYesUse transform policies to hide backend/implentation details in API responsesInformation such as technology stack that is running on the backend and the original URLs that appear in the body of API's HTTP response are private backend info and should be hidden from external customers.MediumNoDo not include secrets directly in API configuration and policiesWhen using Git to save and configure your API Management service configuration, any secrets that are not defined as properties will be stored in the repository and will remain in its history until you disable and re-enable Git access. Properties (Named values) provide a secure place to manage constant string values, including secrets, across all API configuration and policies, so you don't have to store them directly in your policy statements.HighYesUse client certificates for authentication between gateway and backend APIsUse client certificates to secure access to the back-end service of an API and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.HighYes'Requires Subscription' option must be turned on for all products in an API Management instanceWhen publishing APIs through Azure API Management (APIM), the easiest and most common way to secure access to the APIs is by using Subscription Keys. To obtain a Subscription Key for accessing APIs, a Subscription is required. This ensures that a Client applications that need to consume the published APIs must subscribe before making calls to those APIs.HighYesCritical APIs must not be exposed to Guest usersGuest users or unauthenticated developer portal users, such as prospective customers visiting the developer portal of an API Management instance can be granted certain read-only access, such as the ability to view APIs but not call them.MediumYesUse Managed Service Identity (MSI) for accessing other AAD-protected resources from the API management instanceManaged Service Identity (MSI) allows your API Management instance to easily access other AAD-protected resources, such as Azure Key Vault. The identity is managed by the Azure platform and eliminates the need to provision/manage/rotate any secrets thus reducing the overall risk.MediumYesUse the 'Requires Approval' option for APIs where additional checks/manual review is necessaryEnabling 'Requires Approval' ensures that only users approved by API publisher can subscribe to a product.HighNo
