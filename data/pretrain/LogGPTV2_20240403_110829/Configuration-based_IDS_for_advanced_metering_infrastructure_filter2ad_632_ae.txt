### Third and Fourth Order Markov Chains

The third and fourth order Markov chains are illustrated in Figures 8(c) and (d), respectively. It is evident that the state space grows exponentially with an increase in the number of meters for both orders. Specifically, the third-order Markov chain can handle up to 108 meters, while the fourth-order Markov chain can manage up to 16 meters.

Given that many vendors, including our smart grid provider collaborator, typically use between 8 and 16 smart meters per collector, we determined that the fourth-order Markov chain is the optimal choice for maximizing accuracy. This limitation on the number of meters per collector is often due to constraints in bandwidth or coverage in power line communication and WiFi [1, 7]. However, some vendors offer different AMI technologies that can support a higher number of meters per collector, potentially reaching hundreds [7].

### Scalable Solutions

To address the scalability issue, we propose two approaches that provide more scalable solutions with a reasonable trade-off in accuracy:

1. **Third-Order Markov Chain:**
   - The third-order Markov chain also exhibits low conditional entropy, as shown in Figure 2(b).
   - It offers acceptable prediction accuracy, with only a slight increase in false predictions compared to the fourth-order Markov chain, as depicted in Figure 6(b).

2. **State Compression:**
   - We extend the fourth-order Markov chain approach to handle more meters by compressing the state space.
   - Additionally, logs can be divided into groups of 16 meters each for analysis, which can be achieved by filtering the log based on meter IDs.

### State Space Analysis

Figure 8 illustrates the relationship between the number of meters and the number of states for different orders of Markov chains:

- **First Order:** Shown in Figure 8(a)
- **Second Order:** Shown in Figure 8(b)
- **Third Order:** Shown in Figure 8(c)
- **Fourth Order:** Shown in Figure 8(d)

From Figure 3(d), it is clear that only a small fraction (less than 10%) of the states are highly probable. Therefore, after constructing the graph using Algorithm 1, we apply a compression algorithm to remove nodes with lower probabilities. The compressed model maintains detection accuracy but slightly increases the false positive rate from 0.2% to 0.3%. This compressed model can scale to over 1000 meters per collector.

### Limitations

1. **Scalability:**
   - The original fourth-order Markov chain approach scales up to only 16 meters per collector.
   - To handle more meters, we discussed an alternative approach in the scalability section, which supports up to 1000 meters per collector with a slight increase in the false alarm rate.
   - Another option is to divide the smart collector's log into multiple chunks, each containing up to 16 meters, based on meter IDs.

2. **Detection Scope:**
   - Attacks that do not involve communication with the smart collector will not be detected. Such attacks are likely to have limited impact, confined to a specific area.

3. **Evasion Robustness:**
   - Evasion robustness depends on the key used for interval randomization. If the key is compromised, an attacker can generate traffic at expected intervals, evading detection.
   - We assume the key is secure, but if it is compromised, the detection algorithm can be bypassed.

4. **Re-training:**
   - Since AMI uses static configurations with limited protocols and applications, re-training is not required. However, if re-training data includes malicious activities, attackers may evade the proposed technique. This is unlikely if retraining is performed on a large number of smart collectors.

5. **Robustness:**
   - The technique provides robustness against evasion, but an attacker with full access and complete knowledge of the AMI may still be able to evade it.

### Conclusion

In this work, we present a fourth-order Markov chain-based model for intrusion detection, which offers lower conditional entropy and higher prediction accuracy. This model fits the state space requirements of the AMI network under consideration. The novelty lies in the configuration-based stochastic modeling of the AMI using logs collected at the smart collector and device configurations. The proposed approach is practical, requiring minimal computation power and memory, and can be deployed offline in the substation. It achieves an acceptable detection accuracy of over 95% with a false alarm rate close to 0.2%. The model can be extended and customized based on the specific AMI network using additional information in the logs and configurations.

#### Background

Smart grids consist of two major networks: the power distribution network and the communication network. The power distribution network is responsible for power generation, transmission, and distribution to consumers. The communication network monitors various devices in the smart grid, facilitating management and efficient energy consumption. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is a core component of the smart grid, enabling bidirectional communication between the headend and the meter. The basic architecture of AMI includes three main components: Home Area Network (HAN), Neighborhood Area Network (NAN), and Wide Area Network (WAN).

- **HAN:** The customer home network connected to the smart meter, which acts as an interface between the HAN and AMI.
- **NAN:** Responsible for communication between smart collectors and smart meters, scaling from hundreds to thousands of nodes.
- **WAN:** Provides backhaul connectivity for NAN to the headend system, using high-range and bandwidth technologies like cellular or dedicated communication media.

Different communication channels can be used by AMI for different components. For example, NAN may use wireless or power line communication, while WAN uses high-range and bandwidth technologies. Utility providers often utilize existing third-party networks to connect NAN to the headend.
