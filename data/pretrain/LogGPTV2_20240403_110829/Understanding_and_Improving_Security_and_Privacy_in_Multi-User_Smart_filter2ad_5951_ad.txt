locks and lights — again showing physical-world household
social norms reﬂected in the conﬁguration of the smart home.
6.3 Limited Utility from Activity Notiﬁcations
We found varied use of activity notiﬁcations among our par-
ticipants. From our log data, we observe that 14 participants
had activity notiﬁcations on at all times for all devices, while
4 participants used a combination of settings: on, off, and
proximity scoped for various devices. This data suggests that
proximity scoping provided utility for some participants. (One
child participant did not have the app installed.)
But having notiﬁcations enabled does not necessarily mean
that participants found them useful; we now dig further into
our qualitative interview data to understand whether and how
the notiﬁcations were useful to participants. Our participants
found notiﬁcations useful for a few speciﬁc use cases, like
home security and sanity checking their smart home automa-
tions. However, we did not ﬁnd much evidence that our notiﬁ-
cations provided beneﬁts for transparency and agency.
Monitoring and Home Security. Participants found notiﬁ-
cations to be most useful for home security and monitoring
purposes. H1, H6, H7, and H8 used our prototype’s notiﬁca-
tions in conjunction with sensors on their exterior doors and
windows, to passively monitor their home’s security. H3C
used notiﬁcations to monitor devices in their bedroom, to
check if others were entering the room.
Proximity Scoping for Activity Notiﬁcations. While partic-
ipant H8D found proximity scoping useful, as she did not
want to be notiﬁed about devices while away from home,
other participants said that the feature would be more useful
if they could be notiﬁed only when not at home — either as a
home security measure (H8A), or because they could already
tell when their devices changed while at home (H4B).
Conﬁrmation of Home Behaviors. Some participants found
the notiﬁcations to be comforting because they conﬁrmed that
both people and automations were behaving as expected.
It was nice to know it was at that point in the day,
and really what I had it set on were essentially the
lights to come on and go off at appropriate times,
and so it was a notice that, yes, today is progressing
as it should. (H6A-Exit)
Desire for Contextual Notiﬁcations. Our activity notiﬁ-
cations prompted participants to propose more advanced,
context-dependent notiﬁcations that would be more useful
to them. For example, H3C suggested notiﬁcations which
would suggest turning off the lights to save energy. H6A
wanted more intrusive notiﬁcations when something incorrect
happens (e.g., a window is open when it should not be).
We were not able to test whether notiﬁcations would be
helpful for identifying actions caused by speciﬁc automations,
because limitations of the SmartThings API did not let us see
which automation caused an event to happen. None of our
participants mentioned encountering a situation in which they
wanted more speciﬁc information about provenance.
Quick Access via Discovery Notiﬁcations. Most partici-
pants did not notice or see discovery notiﬁcations. (Unfortu-
nately, persistent notiﬁcations of this sort are not supported
on iOS, and few of our participants were Android users.) One
participant, H8D, was interested in these notiﬁcations, but for
convenience, not device discoverability, as it allowed him to
toggle the state of the device without opening the app.
Limited Concern about Privacy. No participants reported
that the notiﬁcations affected their sense of privacy, nor that
they changed their behavior as a result of knowing that noti-
ﬁcations would be shown to others. Participants also did not
report learning new information about others via notiﬁcations.
Notiﬁcations Were Overwhelming or Not Useful. For
some participants, the notiﬁcations were annoying and over-
whelming. H1A said she just did not care when other people,
like her husband and nanny, used devices. H7A complained
about redundant notiﬁcation: each time someone walked
through the front door, their doorbell and contact sensor would
both trigger notiﬁcations, resulting in four notiﬁcations.
Other participants said that the notiﬁcations were not useful
when at home, because it was information that was already
apparent. Participants in H3 and H4 lived in small apartments,
and could naturally observe all of the information from the
notiﬁcations (e.g., the sound of others walking around and the
glow of lights in other rooms). And H7A said that their dogs
already notiﬁed them when people were at the front door.
6.4 Usability and Conﬁguration Complexity
Hands-on experience with our app revealed that the complex-
ity of access controls and other smart home features were
adversely affecting the usability of the system. The complex-
ity came from both the granularity of the settings, and the
number of different devices managed by the home.
Complexity as a Barrier to Access Control Use. While we
168    28th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
aimed to make our prototype’s access controls as easy to
understand as possible, the inherent complexity in the matrix
of options may have still been too much of a barrier for novice
users to conﬁgure them. For example, usability may have been
an issue for H8A/B, where both expressed interest in setting
various access controls during the feature walkthrough in the
initial interview, but did they did not ending up using them.
When we asked about other goals they might have for access
controls and the smart home in general, H8A said:
passwordless public key authentication system for additional
users. However, even this barrier was too much for some
users — H1A did not want to go to the effort for adding their
nanny (despite stating the desire to set access controls for
her), and H8A did not feel conﬁdent in being able to add
her mother-in-law without our guidance. As a result, these
household members were either shut out of the smart home, or
accessed it via other means (i.e. Amazon Echo), bypassing our
prototype’s access controls and losing access to notiﬁcations.
It interests me, but you have to think it through,
what you want to do, how it would beneﬁt you...
part of the Smart Things is you’re taking on a bit of
a responsibility, getting it set up, getting it working,
it’s kind of like getting a new computer, but there’s
a bit of the downside, you have more options but
it’s complicated. (H8A-Exit)
Design Complexity from Combinations of Settings. Dur-
ing the study, participants requested more ﬁne-grained options
for the access control and notiﬁcation features. Based on this
feedback, we iterated on the implementation of our prototype
and released updates. However, we struggled with adding
these features, as each additional access control dimension
compounded the complexity of the interface.
One example was for location-based access controls. Ini-
tially, these access controls were set per-device. However,
H1A and H8B wanted to set these access controls per-user in
addition to per-device, so that they could restrict their nanny
and kids (respectively), but not themselves. To fulﬁll this re-
quest, we had to surface more options (3n options per device,
where n is the number of users, instead of 3 options per de-
vice). As another example, if we wanted to add toggles for
supervisory and reactive access controls to location-based
access control when users are not nearby and try to use the de-
vice, there would not be enough space to display these options
without an additional submenu, making it more laborious to
set policies for each user and device (see Figure 1c).
Usability is fundamentally in tension with the desire to sup-
port access control ﬂexibility and surface all of these options
to users - we discuss this issue further in Section 7.
Displaying Access Control Policies. Participants remarked
that it would have been helpful if the main device control page
(Figure 1a) surfaced each device’s access control policies. Liv-
ing in a home with 14 devices, H1B struggled with identifying
and remembering which devices had access controls:
Seeing the list of all of the devices in the room,
and knowing which ones he could click, and which
ones he couldn’t, and which ones had to ask for
permission... (H1A-Exit)
H1 suggested an interface for favorite devices (a feature
supported by Vera), while H3 suggested that devices that you
did not have access to would simply be hidden.
Install Barrier. We attempted to make the install process as
painless as possible for our app, implementing a QR-code

7.1 Lessons on Smart Home User Behaviors
Based on our in situ prototype evaluation, we surface lessons
about users’ security and privacy behaviors in smart homes,
including how they interact with concrete security and pri-
vacy features in practice, and how our observations of actual
behavior align with user preferences identiﬁed in prior work.
Limited Usage of Access Controls. Though our participants
mentioned multiple use cases for access controls in our initial
interviews, such as restrictions on guests, domestic workers,
and children, in practice, few of them made use of the access
controls we implemented. There are several possible reasons
for this. In two cases, usability was a barrier; one household
was discouraged by the complexity of the access control in-
terface, and the other by the difﬁculty of onboarding guests.
More commonly, participants did not have a strong need to
use access controls, either because they were unconcerned
about restricting access to mundane devices, or that existing
social norms and trust in their household checked against bad
behavior. Lastly, some participants chose not to use access
controls because it would interfere with other desired func-
tionality, like occasionally allowing children remote access.
These ﬁndings suggest that while at ﬁrst glance there are
many user goals that could be achieved with access controls,
there are only a few speciﬁc use cases that access controls
are well suited for in practice, like limiting access for domes-
tic workers. But for other use cases where users have weak
or subtle preferences, access controls can be too rigid, com-
plex, or simply not useful, even with reactive and contextual
mechanisms, such as parental controls.
Importance of Social Norms. Among our study population,
we observed that in circumstances where prior work has
shown the potential for multi-user conﬂicts and privacy is-
sues, our participants often did not experience these problems
due to the norms of interpersonal behavior in their home.
For example, children were trusted to follow rules, room-
mates respected each others’ spaces, and people were not con-
cerned about information revealed by the smart home when it
matched their household’s privacy norms. This ﬁnding sug-
gests that in generally cooperative households, multi-user
security and privacy issues may be able to be addressed in
USENIX Association
28th USENIX Security Symposium    169
part by cultivating good norms around usage of the smart
home. We discuss this topic further below.
Acceptance of Security and Privacy Tradeoffs. As we ex-
pected from prior work [41], participants were willing to
accept (multi-user) security and privacy risks posed by usage
of the smart home because of the convenience and utility it
provided. Participants often explicitly mentioned the tradeoff
between convenience and privacy, when asked about their
concerns about data privacy. H8 decided against setting up
access controls (for parental controls) because the smart home
would be less convenient for the household, and H1 decided
against using access controls for their nanny because the setup
process would be inconvenient. While this ﬁnding is not new,
it re-emphasizes that when designing security and privacy
features for smart homes, these features must work with, and
not limit, users’ primary use cases for the smart home.
7.2 Revisiting our Design Principles
In Section 4, we proposed a set of design principles which we
hypothesized could help address multi-user security and pri-
vacy issues. Based on the insights provided by our evaluation
and user study, we revisit these principles:
Access Control Flexibility: Important But Not a Panacea.
Our results suggest that while access controls might not be
suitable for satisfying all user preferences, the ﬂexible access
control mechanisms we implemented, such as location-based
access controls and per-device ownership, can help users in
clear-cut use cases, like guest access. However, we also found
that increasing ﬂexibility also increases the complexity of
the interface, and as we discuss below, a challenging open
question remains how to support such a complex array of
options in a usable and useful way.
User Agency and Respect: Dominated by Social Norms.
Contrary to our initial hypotheses, we found that our par-
ticipants relied more heavily on household social norms to
support user agency and minimize conﬂicts than the access
control, notiﬁcation, and device discovery features we de-
signed in our prototype. While such norms would not exist in
abusive or adversarial households, for generally cooperative
households, we propose a new research and design question
that we discuss further below: how can a multi-user smart
home be designed to support and leverage positive social
norms, rather than existing alongside or supplanting them?
Transparency of Smart Home Behaviors: Inconclusive.
Our results suggest that smart home transparency features did
not provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts for our participants, in terms of
our design principles (user agency and respect among users).
Participants were generally indifferent to the information pro-
vided by the activity and discovery notiﬁcations, though some
participants found them to be useful for other reasons: home
security and verifying that their automations were working.
However, our investigation is not sufﬁcient to conclude that
transparency might not be valuable in other contexts, e.g.,
with cameras or voice assistants, or among people with more
adversarial relationships. It is also possible that our imple-
mentation of transparency via notiﬁcations was not effective,
and that another design, like calendar [26] or dashboard [5]
interfaces, would provide different reactions.
7.3 Design Recommendations and Challenges
Based on our ﬁndings and revised design principles, we sur-
face several design recommendations for multi-user smart
home systems, particularly for platforms that can orchestrate
access controls and features across all devices of the home.
Support Smart Home-Speciﬁc Access Control Needs. Our
study highlights a number of use cases for access controls
that appear to be common in smart home settings, includ-
ing restrictions on visitors, and different policies for dif-
ferent rooms. To support these use cases, we recommend
that smart home platforms support the following primitives:
(1) Location/proximity-based access control, for handling
guests and domestic workers, as well as restricting access to
media devices, (2) Time-based access control, also for guests,
(3) per-device roles for private rooms, (4) and per-user roles,
for limiting access to device and access control conﬁguration.
Simplify Access Control Conﬁguration. A system with all
of the above access control mechanisms will run into serious
usability challenges if it simply surfaces a large matrix of
multi-dimensional per-user, per-device options. In fact, such
complexity risks increasing the access gap between the smart
home’s primary user and others with less technical or inter-
personal power. It could also put the use of access control out
of reach for novice users. Moreover, complex policies could
introduce errors or conﬂicts between access control rules.
A good ﬁrst step towards simplifying smart home access
control could be to use sensible defaults based on data on
people’s access control preferences, as suggested by He et
al. [16]. However, our results suggest that individual factors,
social norms, and conﬂicting use cases may cause household
needs to diverge from these broad preferences, so it is still
important to have a usable conﬁguration interface. However,
it is not clear what kind of interface would be effective in this
context. In Section 7.4, we recommend that future work inves-
tigate systems for simplifying access control conﬁguration in
smart homes, such as natural language-based policy creation.
Incorporate Voice Assistants into Access Control Sys-
tems. A major limitation of our prototype was that our access
control system could be (intentionally or unintentionally) by-
passed by sending a command through a voice assistant, such
as the Amazon Echo. This is likewise a challenge for current
smart home platforms: in platforms like SmartThings, voice
assistants and other third party apps like IFTTT are given
unrestricted access to smart home devices via OAuth integra-
tions. Additionally, current voice assistants do not explicitly
170    28th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
perform voice recognition, so a smart home would not be able
to identify who is issuing a command. In order for access
controls to be consistently applied, voice assistants should
support voice-based authentication, and voice assistant manu-
facturers should work with smart home platforms to develop a
federated access control system. This is particularly important
as adoption of voice assistants increases and they become a
popular way to interact with smart homes.
