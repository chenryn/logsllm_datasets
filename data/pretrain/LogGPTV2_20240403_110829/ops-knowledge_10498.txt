User: Which linux distro is better suited for Python web development?
Background:
I currently develop on Windows and it's fine, but I am looking to move my core Python development to Linux. I'm sure most any distro will work fine, but does anyone have any reasons to believe one distro is better than another?
Assistant: I use RHEL and have been very happy, so from that I would say Fedora would be fine.  I use Debian at home, and it's great (headless though, so no web there).
That said, I think you should probably just pick one based on what your company uses, or any number of non-Python reasons.  I don't think you are going to find Python tool availability an issue with any Linux distribution.
