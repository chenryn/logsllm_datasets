For Kotlin projects, Glide currently makes use of KAPT. This is generally
quite slow since it requires generating Java stubs before the annotation
processing step.
KSP offers an alternative to this by making it easier for annotation
processors like Glide to more directly use Kotlin's compiler plugin
infrastructure. Based on initial benchmarks, using KSP can speed up build
times by as much as 2x.
