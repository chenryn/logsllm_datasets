hops. A reverse traceroute works by guessing the TTL distance to
the end host, sending a probe, and then searching with larger TTL
if the destination was not reached, or with smaller TTL if it was.
Once the TTL distance to the end host is known, the last three hops
are determined by decrementing the TTL.
The stoplist is then distributed among sources. As each node
traces towards a destination, it stops when an IP on the stoplist
is discovered. Using this technique, we received no abuse reports
either in generating or using the stoplist.
6.3 Routing Loops
Routing loops are a symptom of network misconﬁguration and
can frustrate topology inference. DisCarte found a surprisingly
high number of routing loops: 8,550 source-destination pairs con-
tained a persistent routing loop which prevented packets from reach-
ing the destination. These pairs were re-tested three weeks later.
We were not able to retest 2,071 (24.1%) of these pairs, because the
conﬁguration of the source nodes had changed. At the later date,
4,501 (52.6%) of the loops were resolved, while 1,976 (23.1%) re-
mained.
Of the routing loops that persisted through both tests, 689 unique
routers appear 4,544 times in some part of a loop. China Railway
Internet (CRNET, AS 9394) has more of these routers (61) than
any other AS. Korea Telecom follows with 47 routers, and Level
3 with 35. When weighted by the number of traces that contain
these loops, almost 10% of the routers again belong to CRNET,
almost twice as many as the next-most frequent location, Frontier
Communications of America (AS 5650).
7. VALIDATION
In this section, we validate the output of DisCarte in terms of
accuracy and completeness. We ﬁrst compare the aliases produced
by DisCarte to those produced by Rocketfuel’s ally tool [40]. Then,
we compare the routers, links, and degree distribution of topologies
inferred by DisCarte and the Rocketfuel and Passenger techniques
against four published topologies.
Of course, any active IP-probing methodology will suffer from
inherent shortcomings:
that backup paths and link-layer redun-
dancy are not visible, and that multiple-access network links are
not differentiated from point-to-point links. DisCarte does not ad-
dress these problems, so we do not consider them further.
7.1 RR Aliases
We use the IP-identiﬁer [21, 40] and source-address matching [29,
12] alias resolution techniques to verify the aliases inferred by Dis-
Carte. DisCarte over the BGP-preﬁxes data set found 374,337
aliases, 42,284 (11.2%) of which were not found by direct probe-
based techniques in Rocketfuel’s ally.
We then re-applied ally to conﬁrm the aliases asserted by Dis-
Carte: 88.3% were conﬁrmed to be correct, 3.8% were claimed
to not be aliases by the IP-identiﬁer technique, and the remaining
7.8% were from unresponsive routers and could not be conﬁrmed.
91.2% of the aliases found by DisCarte involved IP addresses dis-
covered only by adding the RR option.
7.2 Comparison to Published Topologies
Research networks including Abilene1, Géant2, National Lamb-
daRail (NLR)3, and Canarie (CANET)4 publish the conﬁguration
ﬁles of their routers, which makes determining a “correct” topology
possible. We compare DisCarte’s inferred map to these true topolo-
gies as well as the topologies produced by the Rocketfuel [40] and
Passenger [38] techniques. To build the correct topology, we parse
the “show interfaces” information available for each router from
each network’s web site. We use publicly available software to
generate Rocketfuel5 and Passenger6 topologies. In each network,
we consider the number and accuracy of discovered routers, the
degree distribution, and completeness of the discovered links.
For each network, we classify each inferred router into one of
four accuracy categories: good, merged, split, and missed.
Good: There is a one-to-one mapping between this inferred router
and a router in the correct topology. All of this router’s dis-
covered interfaces are correctly aliased.
In a perfectly in-
ferred topology, all routers would be good.
Merged: There is a one-to-many mapping between this inferred
router and routers in the correct topology. In this case, mul-
tiple real-world routers are incorrectly inferred as a single
router. Merged routers result from inaccurate alias resolu-
tion, artiﬁcially deﬂate the router count, and inﬂate the node
degree distribution.
Split: There is a many-to-one mapping between routers in the
inferred topology and a single router in the correct topol-
ogy. In this case, a single router from the correct topology
appears split into multiple routers in the inferred topology.
Split routers result from incomplete alias information, inﬂate
the router count, and deﬂate the node degree distribution.
Missed: This router was not found: none of the router’s interfaces
were discovered by the inferred topology. Missing routers
result from insufﬁcient vantage points or from data discarded
due to unresolved conﬂicts (Section 5.2). Missing routers
deﬂate the router count and bias the node degree distribution
towards observed routers.
Classifying the number of inferred routers by accuracy (Figure 7)
illustrates three interesting characteristics. First, although all three
inference schemes tend to have substantial numbers of “split” routers,
Rocketfuel has so many split routers that it incorrectly over-estimates
the router count by as much as seven times the true value. This is a
result of routers that are unresponsive to direct alias probing, so no
aliases are found (recall Figure 1). So, although aliases from Dis-
Carte result in a more accurate topology, more complete alias reso-
lution techniques are still required. Second, for each topology, Dis-
Carte has more “good” nodes than other techniques, except for Pas-
senger in the Géant network. In this exception, Passenger ﬁnds two
more “good” nodes than DisCarte, at the cost of four incorrectly
merged nodes. We demonstrate below that the presence of merged
routers alters the topology’s degree distribution. Third, DisCarte-
inferred topologies have no merged routers and fewer split routers
than Rocketfuel.
Next, we consider the degree distribution of inferred topologies.
Degree distribution affects the accuracy of Internet-modeling [22]
and path diversity studies [44], and has been studied in its own
right [9]. We plot the degree distribution of the topologies inferred

by Rocketfuel, Passenger, and DisCarte along with the actual de-
gree distribution for each published topology (Figure 8). In all net-
works, the DisCarte inferred topology most closely tracks the ac-
tual degree distribution relative to the other two techniques. Also,
the effect of merged routers on the degree distribution is apparent:
Passenger deviates signiﬁcantly from reality in the Géant data set
due to the four merged routers it infers.
Of four published topologies, our inferred topology has no false
links (Table 2), and discovers at least 63% of existing links. We
believe the only way to improve the completeness of the link cov-
erage is to increase the number of measurement vantage points and
their network diversity.
Comparison to research networks at ﬁrst does not appear inher-
ently challenging: their openness, homogeneity, and proximity to
most PlanetLab vantage points make them relatively easy valida-
tion cases. However, each research network is distant from several
vantage points, which are often behind interesting conﬁgurations
(speciﬁcally those sites in China and Israel) that can introduce false
links and aliases. Further, routers of speciﬁc research networks
(Abilene, NLR, CANET) do not respond to alias resolution probes,
which confounds topology inference.
8. TOPOLOGY ANALYSIS
In this section, we consider the degree distribution and sampling
bias apparent in our DisCarte-inferred topology. We chose these
properties because they could be affected by the missing or erro-
neous aliases.
Lakhina et al. [18] introduce a method for evaluating measured
network topologies to see sampling bias in the degree distributions
of routers. The fundamental assumption is that high-degree routers
are equally likely to be anywhere in the topology, and speciﬁcally,
are no more likely to be near to the sources than farther away. A bi-
ased sample would tend to see many of the links incident to nearby
routers, because the shortest path tree from a source is more likely
to include the links of nearby routers, and less likely to include
more than two links on distant routers.
We repeat the analysis of Lakhina et al. and ﬁnd sampling bias
in both DisCarte- and Rocketfuel-inferred topologies. We show the
complementary cumulative distribution of the router out-degrees
(Figures 9 and 10) in the near set (those within the median distance
from a vantage point), in the far set (those of median or greater
distance), and overall. That the near set has somewhat higher de-
gree demonstrates sampling bias in the topology. This suggests that
more data rather than higher-quality topologies are required to re-
move bias.
We expect sampling bias to be present in the topology we mea-
sure. The best approach to eliminating such a bias is most likely
to wildly increase the number of vantage points relative to the des-
tinations as performed in Rocketfuel [40]. Even when doing so,
sampling bias is not eliminated: Lakhina’s test found bias in all
studied topologies.

9. RELATED WORK
We classify related work into four categories: network map-
ping techniques, measurement-based inferences, error-avoidance in
traceroute, and error characterization in network maps.
9.1 Internet Mapping
Techniques for Internet mapping present various methods for se-
In 1995,
lecting traceroute measurements and resolving aliases.
Pansiot and Grad [29] pioneered network mapping by tracerouting
to approximately 3000 destinations and introduced alias resolution
by source address. Mercator [12] revolutionized mapping through
source-routed probes, alias discovery by source routing, and vali-
dation against real-world networks CalREN and Los Nettos. Rock-
etfuel [40] sought ﬁdelity of ten ISP maps by exploiting traceroute
servers and added alias resolution by IP address. Skitter [7] and
iPlane [21] apply many of these techniques continuously, making a
current reference topology available to researchers.
DisCarte is comparable to these projects in that it introduces a
new and more complete technique for improving the correctness
of the network mapping and a novel method for alias resolution.
We approached correctness in the measured topology by measur-
ing each path using two methods (RR and TR) so that we can de-
tect and remove disputed conclusions. These features are crucial to
continued network instrumentation because (a) security concerns
cause administrators to ﬁlter trafﬁc destined for routers and (b) the
scale of the network demands such a large scale measurement that
some collected traces are certain to have errors, and unlike in the
natural sciences, these errors are not averaged out by further mea-
surements.
9.2 Learning and Inference Techniques
Techniques to interpret raw network measurements are some-
times required; these often involve learning techniques to manage
the scale of the problem. Padmanabhan used Gibbs sampling and
Bayesian learning to discover lossy links [28]. Mahajan et al. [23]
used linear constraints to model intra-domain link weights: a study
that could imply a means of detecting and removing false links
(those that have too high a cost to be used). Yao et al. [45] present
a technique for merging anonymous routers—those that do not re-
spond to traceroute that might otherwise be ignored in a topology
(potentially partitioning the network) or thought unique on each ob-
servation (wildly inﬂating the path diversity). Finally, Gunes and
Sarac [14] use the addressing structure of the network to deduce
the preﬁxes to which interface addresses belong and infer aliases.
9.3 Traceroute Error Avoidance
Although we apply the paired measurement of TR and RR to
bolster uncertain measurements, an alternate, but complementary,
approach is to reduce the likelihood of error in the ﬁrst place. Au-
gustin et al. [3] observe that router load balancing is typically ﬂow
based:
to restrict a traceroute to a single path requires only re-
designing the tool to preserve the ﬁve-tuple of protocol with source
and destination address and port.
Our previous work showed that RR had the potential to detect
route changes and could be applied toward a more reliable trace-
route [38]. However, we found that simple methods were intractable
and were unable to process almost 40% of our data.
9.4 Network Map Errors
Some errors in network maps may be avoided through improved
techniques. Teixeira et al. [44] noted a lack of ﬁdelity in Rocketfuel
maps: measurements were incomplete (backup links were missing)
and aliases were missing or erroneous (some addresses were split
and merged). In estimating path diversity, these factors somewhat
canceled each other, but the result was not reliable.
10. RECORD ROUTE REDESIGN
If the record route IP option were designed today, it would bene-
ﬁt from more precise standardization and the ability to sample paths
longer than 9 hops.
