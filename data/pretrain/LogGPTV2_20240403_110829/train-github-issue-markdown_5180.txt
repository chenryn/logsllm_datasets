##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
The shell module is ignoring proxy environment  
I'm working on some server with limited internet connexion (need to use proxy
settings)
On some module, i need to set environment otherwise i get a timeout.  
It's a main issue for me as i don't want to have duplication code and/or
specific code for limited internet machine (just need to specifigy http_proxy
on them)
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.3.2.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
      python version = 2.7.14 (default, Nov  3 2017, 10:55:25) [GCC 7.2.1 20170915 (Red Hat 7.2.1-2)]
##### CONFIGURATION
