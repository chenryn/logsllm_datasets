Question: "A development team has implemented session validation to secure form submissions in their web application. Despite this measure, you are concerned about the threat of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. What are the primary reasons why session validation alone is insufficient to prevent CSRF, and what additional steps should be taken to enhance security?"
 "A": "Session validation does not prevent CSRF because the attacker can forge a request from a user's browser with a valid session; additional steps include using anti-CSRF tokens and ensuring no cross-site scripting vulnerabilities."
 "B": "Session validation is sufficient on its own; no further action is required."
 "C": "Session validation is only effective for stateless applications; for stateful applications, implement secure socket layer (SSL) encryption."
 "D": "CSRF attacks can bypass session validation by exploiting open redirect vulnerabilities; it is essential to use the HTTP Referer header for validation."
Answer: A
