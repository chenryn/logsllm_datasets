When loading an obj file such as the following:
    v  0 1 1
    v  1 1 0
    v  1 0 1
    v  1 1 1
    f  1 2 3
    f  1 2 4
The resulting `THREE.Geometry` contains 10 vertices, rather than the expected
4. This is because a new set of vertices are created for every face, rather
than the same vertex reused.
