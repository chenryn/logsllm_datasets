### System info
  * Playwright Version: v1.24.2
  * Node version: 18.12.1
  * Operating System: windows server 2019
  * Browser: Chromium
### Issue
The download event is not triggered when I am using the machine to reach some
internal site. If I open the chromium.exe manually, I can download the file
with the same button clicked.
This issue only happens when I go to the internal sites, if I go to some
public website and perform a button click download, the program works well. I
have another server running the same node and playwright version with windows
server 2016, which can download file no matter which website it is using the
same program.
I would like to know is there something I configure playwright wrong or only a
permission issue. As the code I am using, I only know that I perform a button
click successfully and don't know if the download event emit or not.
### Code Snippet
       const browser = await chromium.launch({
        headless: true,
        args: ["--no-sandbox"],
        downloadsPath: path_to_data,
        executablePath: path.resolve(
          "./node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-win/chrome.exe"  
        ),
      });
      const context = await browser.newContext({acceptDownloads: true });
      const page = await context.newPage();
    // some code here
      page.on("download", async (dl) => {
               const downloaded = await dl.path();
               console.log("Download Finished");
               var real_file_name = startDate +"_"+ endDate;
              real_file_name = "Download - "+real_file_name.replace(/-/g, '')+".xlsx"; 
              renameSync(downloaded, `${path_to_data}/${real_file_name}`);
              console.log("Rename Finished");
              await browser.close();
              success = true;
             });
      await page.click('button:text("Export")', { force: true });
      console.log("Start Downloading");
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10000));

    				Download
When I run the internal site, the code will stop at Start Downloading and then
end whten the timeout end, while when the code is run on another server, it
will trigger the download event.
