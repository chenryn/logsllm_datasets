User:  Operation and maintenance personnel need to deploy and update code between multiple sites. How to use Git to implement code version control and automatic deployment?
Assistant: The steps are as follows: 1. Create a repository in Git, and submit the code to the repository for management. 2. Install the Git client in each site and connect it to the repository on the Git server. 3. Establish automated deployment scripts in each site, such as using Git hooks to trigger automatic code updates when codes are updated. 4. Configure Git Webhook and associate it with an automation script to automatically execute the script after the code is updated to perform code deployment and update operations. 5. Create a GIt warehouse on the server and configure hooks to realize automatic updates after code modification. Through the above steps, operation and maintenance personnel can achieve the goal of automatically deploying and updating code, and improve work efficiency and code quality. At the same time, Git's version control function can also help operation and maintenance personnel to better manage code versions, quickly roll back code and other operations.
