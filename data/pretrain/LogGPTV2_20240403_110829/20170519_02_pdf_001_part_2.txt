### Introduction to Pointcloud and PostgreSQL Integration

To manage and analyze point cloud data effectively, we can utilize the `pointcloud` extension in PostgreSQL. This extension provides a set of functions and types to handle point cloud data, including JSON output for easy integration with existing parsing functions.

#### Retrieving and Manipulating Point Data

1. **Retrieving Point Data:**
   You can retrieve specific dimensions from a point using the `PC_Get` function. For example, to get the 'z' dimension:
   ```sql
   SELECT PC_Get(pt, 'z')
   FROM pcpoints;
   ```

2. **Casting to PostGIS Geometry:**
   If you have the `pointcloud_postgis` extension enabled, you can cast point cloud points to PostGIS geometry for visualization or spatial analysis:
   ```sql
   SELECT ST_AsText(pt::geometry)
   FROM pcpoints;
   ```
   This will return a PostGIS geometry representation, such as:
   ```
   POINT Z (-126 45 34)
   ```

#### Adding and Aggregating Points

1. **Adding Points:**
   To add a new point to the `pcpoints` table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO pcpoints (pt)
   VALUES (PC_MakePoint(1, ARRAY[-127, 46, 35, 5]));
   ```

2. **Creating Patches:**
   To aggregate multiple points into a patch, you can use the `PC_Patch` function:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE pcpatches AS
   SELECT PC_Patch(pt) AS pa
   FROM pcpoints;
   ```

3. **Viewing Patches in JSON:**
   To view the patch in JSON format:
   ```sql
   SELECT PC_AsText(pa)
   FROM pcpatches;
   ```
   The output will be a JSON representation of the patch:
   ```json
   {
     "pcid": 1,
     "pts": [
       [-126, 45, 34, 4],
       [-127, 46, 35, 5]
     ]
   }
   ```

#### Exploding Patches and Filtering Points

1. **Exploding Patches:**
   To break down a patch into individual points:
   ```sql
   SELECT PC_AsText(PC_Explode(pa))
   FROM pcpatches;
   ```
   This will return each point in the patch as a separate JSON object:
   ```json
   {"pcid":1, "pt":[-126,45,34,4]}
   {"pcid":1, "pt":[-127,46,35,5]}
   ```

2. **Filtering Points:**
   You can filter points based on any attribute or pass them through PostGIS for spatial filtering. For example, to filter by the 'z' dimension:
   ```sql
   SELECT PC_Get(pt, 'z') AS z
   FROM (
     SELECT PC_Explode(pa) AS pt
     FROM pcpatches
   ) AS points
   WHERE PC_Get(pt, 'z') > 2500;
   ```

### Real-World Data Loading and Processing

To load real-world data into the database, we use the PDAL (Point Data Abstraction Library), an open-source LIDAR processing tool. PDAL supports various input and output formats and allows for processing chains.

#### Example: Loading Mt. St. Helens Data

1. **PDAL Pipeline:**
   For the Natural Resources Canada project, I wrote a PostgreSQL Pointcloud driver for PDAL. The pipeline file for loading a 420MB LAS file of Mt. St. Helens with 12 million points looks like this:
   ```ini
   host='localhost' dbname='pc' user='pramsey'
   mtsthelens
   26910
   400
   3
   32184
   st-helens.las
   EPSG:26910
   ```

2. **Chipping the Data:**
   The pipeline uses a chipping filter to break the file into smaller patches suitable for database storage. The writer driver requires a connection string and destination table name.

3. **Verifying the Load:**
   After loading, the `mtsthelens` table contains 12 million points in 30,971 patches:
   ```sql
   SELECT Count(*), Sum(PC_NumPoints(pa))
   FROM mtsthelens;
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   count | sum
   -------+----------
   30971 | 12388139
   ```

### Analyzing the Data

#### Calculating the Average Elevation of the Rim

1. **Digitizing the Rim:**
   I digitized a line around the rim to calculate the average elevation within a 15-meter buffer.

2. **Multi-Stage Query:**
   Using the `WITH` clause, we can perform a multi-stage query to find the average elevation:
   ```sql
   WITH patches AS (
     SELECT pa
     FROM mtsthelens m, mtsthelens_rim r
     WHERE PC_Intersects(m.pa, ST_Buffer(r.geom, 15))
   ),
   points AS (
     SELECT PC_Explode(pa) AS pt
     FROM patches
   ),
   filtered_points AS (
     SELECT PC_Get(pt, 'z') AS z
     FROM points, mtsthelens_rim r
     WHERE ST_Intersects(pt::geometry, ST_Buffer(r.geom, 15))
   )
   SELECT avg(z), count(z)
   FROM filtered_points;
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   avg | count
   -------------------
   2425.086 | 108736
   ```

3. **Analyzing Elevation Above 2500 Meters:**
   To find all points above 2500 meters:
   ```sql
   WITH points AS (
     SELECT PC_Explode(pa) AS pt
     FROM mtsthelens
   )
   SELECT pt::geometry
   FROM points
   WHERE PC_Get(pt, 'z') > 2500;
   ```

### Compression and Performance

#### Compression Modes

1. **None:**
   - Stores data as packed bytes.
   - No compression.

2. **Dimensional:**
   - Default mode.
   - Compresses each dimension separately.
   - Uses run-length, common bits, or zlib.
   - 4-5 times smaller than uncompressed LAS.

3. **GeohashTree (Experimental):**
   - Orders points into a prefix tree based on geohash code.
   - 2-4 times smaller depending on parameters.

### Future Work

Several new functions and improvements are planned, including:
- `PC_Transform`, `PC_Intersection`, `PC_Raster`, and `PC_FilterBetween`.
- Enhanced flexibility in PDAL reader and writer queries.
