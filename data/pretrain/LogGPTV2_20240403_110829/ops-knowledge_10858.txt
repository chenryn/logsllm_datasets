User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题yahoo cannot deliver e-mail to my server over TLS I am getting the following error in the logs for inbound yahoo e-mails:

postfix/smtpd[8679]: SSL_accept error from sonic324-12.consmr.mail.gq1.yahoo.com[98.137.70.36]: 0
postfix/smtpd[8679]: warning: TLS library problem: error:14094416:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3 alert certificate unknown:s3_pkt.c:1278:SSL alert number 46:
postfix/smtpd[8679]: lost connection after STARTTLS from sonic324-12.consmr.mail.gq1.yahoo.com[98.137.70.36]


It only happens with yahoo and their client reconnects in plaintext. 
I am on Postfix 2.11.0 and OpenSSL 1.0.2h. I am using a Let's Encrypt certificate.

Assistant: For the record, this is absolutely a Yahoo SMTP issue. They fail to implement opportunistic TLS correctly, and shoot themselves in the foot by sending in the clear (without TLS) when WebPKI authentication fails. That makes no sense, sending in the clear is never more secure, and still not authenticated. Yahoo engineers have on a few occasions promised to fix this, but it has not (August 2018) happened as yet.
