### Research Methods for IT Shared Service Centers

The research into the operations and effectiveness of an IT shared service center can be conducted using a combination of several methods, including:

1. **Questionnaires:**
   - **Objective:** To gather structured data on the current state and future expectations of the IT shared service center.
   - **Method:** Standardized questionnaires are distributed to relevant stakeholders. These questionnaires are designed to capture quantitative and qualitative data, providing a broad overview of the center's performance and areas for improvement.

2. **Interviews:**
   - **Objective:** To gain in-depth insights and detailed feedback from key individuals.
   - **Method:** Face-to-face or virtual interviews are conducted with stakeholders at various levels, such as executives, managers, and end-users. This method allows for a more nuanced understanding of the center's strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for enhancement.

3. **Meetings:**
   - **Objective:** To collect information and perspectives from a group setting.
   - **Method:** Participate in or convene meetings with relevant departments or a select group of stakeholders. These meetings facilitate open discussions and provide a platform for sharing experiences and expectations.

4. **On-site Inspections:**
   - **Objective:** To observe the actual working environment and user experience.
   - **Method:** Conduct on-site visits to the IT shared service center. This involves direct observation, interaction with users, and assessment of the physical and digital infrastructure. The goal is to understand the operational realities and identify any discrepancies between the reported and observed conditions.

5. **Document Review:**
   - **Objective:** To analyze existing documentation and reports.
   - **Method:** Review available documents, reports, and other relevant materials. This method helps in understanding the historical context, current practices, and documented policies and procedures of the IT shared service center.

6. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - **Objective:** To quantify and interpret the collected data.
   - **Method:** Organize and analyze the data gathered through the above methods. Statistical tools and techniques are used to derive meaningful insights and draw conclusions that can inform decision-making and strategic planning.

### Stakeholder Involvement
To ensure the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the research, it is essential to involve stakeholders at different levels:
- **Executive Level:** Senior leaders who provide strategic direction and oversight.
- **Management Level:** Middle managers who oversee day-to-day operations and implement strategies.
- **Decision-Making Level:** Key personnel involved in making critical decisions and driving change.

### Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the current state, identifying pain points, and defining requirements. This approach involves:
- **Problem Identification:** Clearly define the issues or challenges faced by the IT shared service center.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Place the identified problems within their specific scenarios, considering participants, internal and external environments, process factors, tool platforms, and role responsibilities.
- **Expectation Setting:** Identify and articulate the expectations of stakeholders.
- **Requirement Definition:** Define requirements using the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) principle to ensure they are clear, actionable, and realistic.

By combining these research methods and involving multiple stakeholder levels, the study can provide a comprehensive and actionable understanding of the IT shared service center's operations and potential improvements.
