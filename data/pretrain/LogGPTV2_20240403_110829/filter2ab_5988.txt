**ATT&CK ID:** T1548.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Elevated Execution with Prompt

Adversaries may exploit the `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` API to escalate their privileges by prompting the user for credentials. This API is designed to provide application developers with a straightforward method to execute operations that require root privileges, such as during application installation or updates. However, the API does not verify whether the program requesting these elevated privileges originates from a trusted source or has been tampered with maliciously.
