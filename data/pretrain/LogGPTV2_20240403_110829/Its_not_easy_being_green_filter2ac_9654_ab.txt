recent years. Attracting outsiders, both residential and commercial, can be one of the most 
important economic impacts local parks can have on a community. 
The traditional way of thinking was that a workforce would follow wherever companies 
choose to locate. Studies indicate a paradigm shift in that approach, particularly as technology has 
become a more integral part of operational efficiencies in the business world. Companies now tend 
to locate where they can find pools of experienced, tech-savvy workers who are influenced directly 
in where they choose to live by quality of life amenities. 
This theory is supported in an assessment of the economic impact of parks on business 
activity prepared by Dr. Ray Perryman, a renowned Texas economist. The report, entitled 
“Sunshine, Soccer and Success”, mentions surveys of knowledge workers who claim that the quality 
of life in a community increased the attractiveness of a job by 33%. The study also contends that the

attraction of knowledge workers to an area is influenced by the quality of the location, particularly 
the variety and accessibility of natural, recreational, and lifestyle amenities. Additionally, 
Perryman’s study references a poll taken in 2001 of 50 senior executives in Fortune 500 companies 
who rated quality of life issues (such as parks and recreation, traffic, and climate) as one of the most 
important attributes of cities being considered for company relocations. The factor rated most 
important was the availability of highly skilled workers who, according to the study, are influenced 
by the quality of local parks, among other things. (Perryman, 2006) 
The idea of parks and recreation amenities serving as business attractors is not new. In an 
effort to provide a competitive edge for cities in Texas to attract new primary businesses, Texas 
legislators enacted a law in 1979 entitled the Development Corporation Act. The Act allows 
municipalities to use, after voter approval, ½ cent of their local sales tax for economic (Type A) and 
community (Type B) development projects that will attract new and expanded business 
enterprises. Many communities use Type B funds to build parks, trails, stadiums, and other 
amenities that will not only attract tourists, but make them more appealing when competing for 
educated and highly skilled workers.
Some public officials are recognizing the importance recreational amenities play in creating 
vibrant, attractive communities that appeal to the highly sought knowledge workforce. This point 
was driven home by the city of Austin’s chief of staff, Anthony Snipes, at a roundtable discussion of 
the value of parks with a group of city managers during the 2009 Texas Recreation and Parks 
Society Annual Institute in Frisco, TX. Snipes told a story about a family member who was 
graduating from college and was asked what he was going to do afterward. The graduate said, “I’m 
moving to Austin.” When asked where he was going to work, he said “I don’t know yet. I just want to 
live there….it’s a fun city. I’ll find a job after I get there!” Snipes finished the story by stating that this 
is a generational trend with new college graduates. “They decide where they want to live first, and 
then they look for a job. Of course we say, choose Austin!” (Snipes, 2009). A logical conclusion is 
that, to be competitive in attracting workers and companies, successful economic development 
endeavors must include an investment in parks and other quality of life features in the strategy.
Throughout this exploration of the economic value of parks, the health benefits they 
provide cannot be ignored.  One of the biggest challenges facing our country is the rising cost of 
Impact on Health Care Costs

health care due to the obesity epidemic. The negative impact of health care costs on companies was 
researched and identified in a recent report from Susan Combs, Texas State Comptroller, entitled 
Gaining Costs, Losing Time: The Obesity Crisis in Texas.  The report states that obesity related health 
care including absenteeism, decreased productivity, and increased disabilities, costs Texas 
businesses $9.5 billion annually. If the obesity rate and cost of health care continues as projected, 
the price tag for businesses could reach $32.5 billion by 2030.  The report states “Texas businesses 
are paying an enormous price for obesity, diverting tax dollars that could be invested in business 
expansion, job creation and building a strong Texas economy.” The study found that in 2009, two-
thirds of adult Texans (66.7%) were overweight or obese, slightly higher than the national rate of 
63.2%. Additionally, of Texas children aged 10-17, 20.4% were obese compared to 16.4% of 
children in America. (Combs, 2011)
The negative impact of obesity reaches beyond just the Texas economy. For instance, in an 
article in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine in 2004, researchers found the airline 
industry consumes 350 million more gallons per year of fuel at an extra cost of $275 million 
annually, due to an increase in the average weight of passengers. (Dannenberg, Andrew L.; Burton, 
Deron C.; Jackson, Richard J., 2004)  Additionally, the manufacturing industry has been forced to 
expand product lines such as clothing, furniture, and health care equipment, to name a few, to 
accommodate overweight consumers. The impact obesity has on the U.S. economy is too extensive 
to explore in this paper, but with certainty, efforts by both the public and private sector must be a 
focus to address the problem, and parks play an important role in the solution.
The number one opportunity to combat obesity is prevention. Healthy lifestyles, including 
proper diet and physical activity, are critical parts of the prevention solution. Play spaces for 
physical activity are typically one of the first benefits people associate with parks. Trails, 
playgrounds, ball fields, and open space, play a critical role in the fight against health problems and 
their associated costs. Perryman’s report reflects this by stating: “Research shows that availability 
of open space improves psychological health, and those with access to parks tend to exercise more.” 
It goes on to note how the increase in organized youth sports over the past decade has placed a 
higher demand on affordable access to municipal sports facilities. “Nationally, 52% of youth sports 
organizations offered sports in indoor community owned facilities and 83% offered activities in 
community-owned outdoor facilities” Perryman reported. Additionally his study states that “more 
than 72% of Americans over the age of 16 participated in outdoor activities, and people with good 
Wellness and Parks
10
Tourism and Parks
access to both built and natural facilities are 43% more likely to exercise 30 minutes multiple days 
of the week.” (Perryman, 2006) 
Investing in parks, trails, and spaces for active recreation is critical if government is to be a 
part of an effective solution to address the rising cost of health care. Facilities must be convenient, 
accessible, safe, and well-maintained to attract both children and adult users. Some tax payers may 
question whether government should be in the business of providing these types of facilities, 
especially if not everyone in the community uses them. What must be considered is that everyone 
benefits from them directly or indirectly, due to the role they play in keeping citizens active and 
healthy. This can help lower health care costs with an overall positive impact on the economy.
The final and perhaps most compelling argument for how “green” parks can be, exists in the 
role they play in attracting visitors to spend outside dollars in a community, region, or state. In a 
study by Dr. John Crompton entitled Measuring  the Economic Impact  of Parks  and  Recreation  
Services, the role parks play in tourism was explored with quantifiable measuring tools. Crompton 
states in the report: “Tourism depends on attractions. Rarely do people travel because they enjoy 
the car or airplane ride, or because they want to stay in a particular hotel or dine at a restaurant in 
a different city. The desire to go to another place is stimulated by attractions.” (Crompton, 2010).
Attractions fall in many categories. Scenic and natural attractions such as beaches or 
mountains may come to mind first when choosing a travel destination. Some may journey with a 
cultural or historical destination involving festivals, museums, or landmarks. Others may choose 
entertainment options such as amusement parks, professional sports venues, casinos or theaters. 
Not every city is fortunate enough to have large scale tourist attractions; however, a more common 
opportunity for communities to capitalize on tourism dollars is through activities such as local, 
regional, or state amateur athletic competitions, large festivals or other events at community 
owned facilities.
Often, events hosted at publicly owned and operated facilities are viewed as a drain on 
municipal budgets. This can be very short-sided as it typically only takes into account the direct 
revenue generated by the event and compares it to the overall operational expenditures of the 
facility. What is frequently overlooked is the opportunity to identify what the actual economic 
impact a local attraction, such as a sports complex, has on a municipality.
11
Economic Impact Studies
Economic impact studies are an important tool when determining the true value of parks on 
a community. However, results can be skewed in a way that can call their meaning and credibility 
into question, especially if they are used to “sell” large bond packages to stakeholders. A viable 
economic impact study can show how an attraction brings outside dollars to be spent on the local 
economy, which helps create jobs and income for local residents. Residents, in turn, spend money 
and pay taxes locally which provide more income for businesses and revenue to support 
government services. The cycle of tourism spending and resulting local job income and tax revenue 
can be multiplied to several levels depending on the types of businesses located in a particular 
community. 
Crompton’s research provides an in-depth report on the proper methodology for 
conducting these studies. One example from his research (Figure 3) shows the rate of economic 
return tournaments that a $12 million softball complex can have on a community. (Crompton, 
2010).

1810 players on 133 teams participated in the tournament. All were from out-of-town. Because it was an 
elimination tournament, the length of time the teams stayed varied from 4-7 nights. 697 players’ parents 
were surveyed.

There is no doubt that a park, used as a destination facility, can create a significant 
economic return on the investment. On the other hand, quantifying that return should be done 
carefully using multipliers that are relevant to the locality in which the facility is located. These 
should include on-site surveys to determine the actual average per day spending that has taken 
place as a result of the event. Additionally, it’s important to identify the number of local participants 
for an event since locals will spend less per day than visitors in town. Properly done, economic 
impact reports are important tools for helping determine the true value a destination park facility 
has on a community by showing how visitor dollars support the local economy.
There are many ways to show how “green” parks can be for communities, several of which 
were covered in this research. Beyond just their aesthetic or environmental value, parks provide 
significant economic benefits through increased property values, business and workforce 
attraction, reduction in health care costs, and bringing tourism dollars to communities. 
Unfortunately, they tend to remain undervalued and are not always viewed as an “essential” service 
that helps solve social or economic problems. 
Although Kermit began his song “Bein’ Green” by lamenting the downside of his color, he 
went on to sing about the positive aspects of his existence. (Raposo, 1970)
Conclusion
“But green's the color of spring
And green can be cool and friendly-like
And green can be big like a mountain
Or important like a river
Or tall like a tree…..” 
13
Like Kermit, the research included in this paper shows that parks can and should be looked 
on as being “big like a mountain, important like a river, and tall like a tree”. When budgets are 
tightened, public managers and elected officials are short-sighted if they make deeper cuts to parks 
funding without understanding the bigger picture and true impact parks play in positively 
influencing the local economy. Increasing efficiencies in all service sectors, through process 
improvement initiatives, exploring partnerships with the private sector, creatively generating more 
revenue, or finding other ways to do more with less, are more effective ways to deal with budget 
shortages in the long term. Parks departments have been operating this way for decades as a 
matter of survival, but remain undervalued as the economic engines they are or could be. Because 
of this, parks professionals know only too well……….it’s not easy being green.
