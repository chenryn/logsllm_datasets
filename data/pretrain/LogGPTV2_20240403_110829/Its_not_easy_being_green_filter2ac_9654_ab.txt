In recent years, the ability to attract both residential and commercial outsiders has emerged as one of the most significant economic impacts local parks can have on a community. Traditionally, it was believed that a workforce would follow wherever companies chose to locate. However, studies now indicate a paradigm shift in this approach, particularly as technology has become more integral to operational efficiencies in the business world. Companies now tend to locate where they can find pools of experienced, tech-savvy workers, who are influenced by the quality of life amenities available in their potential new home.

This theory is supported by an assessment of the economic impact of parks on business activity, prepared by Dr. Ray Perryman, a renowned Texas economist. The report, titled "Sunshine, Soccer, and Success," cites surveys of knowledge workers who claim that the quality of life in a community increases the attractiveness of a job by 33%. The study also contends that the attraction of knowledge workers to an area is significantly influenced by the quality of the location, particularly the variety and accessibility of natural, recreational, and lifestyle amenities. Additionally, Perryman’s study references a 2001 poll of 50 senior executives in Fortune 500 companies, who rated quality of life issues (such as parks and recreation, traffic, and climate) as one of the most important attributes of cities being considered for company relocations. The factor rated most important was the availability of highly skilled workers, who, according to the study, are influenced by the quality of local parks, among other things (Perryman, 2006).

The concept of parks and recreational amenities serving as business attractors is not new. In 1979, Texas legislators enacted the Development Corporation Act, which allows municipalities, with voter approval, to use half a cent of their local sales tax for economic (Type A) and community (Type B) development projects. Many communities use Type B funds to build parks, trails, stadiums, and other amenities that not only attract tourists but also make them more appealing when competing for educated and highly skilled workers.

Some public officials recognize the importance of recreational amenities in creating vibrant, attractive communities that appeal to the highly sought-after knowledge workforce. This point was highlighted by Anthony Snipes, Chief of Staff for the City of Austin, during a roundtable discussion at the 2009 Texas Recreation and Parks Society Annual Institute in Frisco, TX. Snipes shared a story about a family member who, upon graduating from college, decided to move to Austin because it was a fun city, even though he did not yet have a job. Snipes concluded that this is a generational trend, with new college graduates deciding where they want to live first and then looking for a job (Snipes, 2009). Therefore, to be competitive in attracting workers and companies, successful economic development strategies must include investments in parks and other quality-of-life features.

Beyond the economic benefits, the health benefits provided by parks cannot be overlooked. One of the biggest challenges facing the country is the rising cost of healthcare due to the obesity epidemic. According to a report by Susan Combs, the Texas State Comptroller, titled "Gaining Costs, Losing Time: The Obesity Crisis in Texas," obesity-related healthcare costs, including absenteeism, decreased productivity, and increased disabilities, cost Texas businesses $9.5 billion annually. If the obesity rate and healthcare costs continue to rise as projected, the price tag for businesses could reach $32.5 billion by 2030 (Combs, 2011). The report emphasizes that Texas businesses are paying an enormous price for obesity, diverting tax dollars that could otherwise be invested in business expansion, job creation, and building a strong Texas economy.

The negative impact of obesity extends beyond the Texas economy. For example, a 2004 article in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine found that the airline industry consumes 350 million more gallons of fuel per year, at an extra cost of $275 million annually, due to the increase in the average weight of passengers (Dannenberg, Burton, & Jackson, 2004). Additionally, the manufacturing industry has had to expand product lines, such as clothing, furniture, and healthcare equipment, to accommodate overweight consumers. The impact of obesity on the U.S. economy is extensive, and efforts by both the public and private sectors must focus on addressing the problem, with parks playing a crucial role in the solution.

Prevention is the number one opportunity to combat obesity. Healthy lifestyles, including proper diet and physical activity, are critical parts of the prevention solution. Play spaces for physical activity, such as trails, playgrounds, ball fields, and open spaces, play a critical role in fighting health problems and their associated costs. Perryman’s report reflects this by stating that the availability of open space improves psychological health and that those with access to parks tend to exercise more (Perryman, 2006). The increase in organized youth sports over the past decade has also placed a higher demand on affordable access to municipal sports facilities. Nationally, 52% of youth sports organizations offered sports in indoor community-owned facilities, and 83% offered activities in community-owned outdoor facilities (Perryman, 2006). Furthermore, more than 72% of Americans over the age of 16 participated in outdoor activities, and people with good access to both built and natural facilities are 43% more likely to exercise 30 minutes multiple days of the week (Perryman, 2006).

Investing in parks, trails, and spaces for active recreation is critical if the government is to be part of an effective solution to address the rising cost of healthcare. Facilities must be convenient, accessible, safe, and well-maintained to attract both children and adult users. While some taxpayers may question whether the government should provide these types of facilities, especially if not everyone in the community uses them, it is important to consider that everyone benefits directly or indirectly from the role these facilities play in keeping citizens active and healthy, which can help lower healthcare costs and have an overall positive impact on the economy.

Finally, perhaps the most compelling argument for the value of parks is their role in attracting visitors to spend outside dollars in a community, region, or state. In a study by Dr. John Crompton, titled "Measuring the Economic Impact of Parks and Recreation Services," the role of parks in tourism was explored using quantifiable measuring tools. Crompton states that tourism depends on attractions, and while not every city has large-scale tourist attractions, many communities can capitalize on tourism dollars through activities such as local, regional, or state amateur athletic competitions, large festivals, or other events at community-owned facilities (Crompton, 2010).

Economic impact studies are an important tool for determining the true value of parks on a community. However, results can be skewed, especially if they are used to "sell" large bond packages to stakeholders. A viable economic impact study can show how an attraction brings outside dollars to be spent on the local economy, which helps create jobs and income for local residents. Residents, in turn, spend money and pay taxes locally, providing more income for businesses and revenue to support government services. The cycle of tourism spending and resulting local job income and tax revenue can be multiplied depending on the types of businesses located in a particular community (Crompton, 2010).

There is no doubt that a park, used as a destination facility, can create a significant economic return on investment. Quantifying that return should be done carefully using multipliers relevant to the locality in which the facility is located. These should include on-site surveys to determine the actual average per day spending that has taken place as a result of the event. Additionally, it is important to identify the number of local participants for an event since locals will spend less per day than visitors in town. Properly conducted, economic impact reports are important tools for helping determine the true value a destination park facility has on a community by showing how visitor dollars support the local economy.

In conclusion, parks provide significant economic benefits through increased property values, business and workforce attraction, reduction in healthcare costs, and bringing tourism dollars to communities. Unfortunately, they tend to remain undervalued and are not always viewed as an "essential" service that helps solve social or economic problems. Like Kermit the Frog, who lamented the downside of his color but went on to sing about the positive aspects of his existence, parks can and should be looked upon as "big like a mountain, important like a river, and tall like a tree." When budgets are tight, public managers and elected officials are short-sighted if they make deeper cuts to parks funding without understanding the bigger picture and the true impact parks play in positively influencing the local economy. Increasing efficiencies, exploring partnerships with the private sector, and creatively generating more revenue are more effective ways to deal with budget shortages in the long term. Parks departments have been operating this way for decades, but they remain undervalued as the economic engines they are or could be. As parks professionals know all too well, it's not easy being green.
