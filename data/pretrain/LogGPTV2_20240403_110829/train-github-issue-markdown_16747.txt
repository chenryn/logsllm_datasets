### Context
- **Playwright Version:** ^1.29.1
- **Operating System:** Windows 11
- **Node.js Version:** v19.0.1
- **Browser:** Chromium

### Code Snippet
```javascript
test("repro", async ({ page, context }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:8080');
  await page.locator('#theForceIsStrongWithThisOne').click({ timeout: 3000 });
});
```

### HTML
```html
Keep On Darthin' In The Free World
These are the blog articles you are looking for, if not, use the filter button above.
```
CSS for the "filter" class:
```css
.filter:after {
  position: absolute;
  border-left: .25em solid;
  left: -.125em;
  top: -.2em;
  height: .4em;
  content: ' ';
}
```

### Bug Description
When running this test in Chromium, Playwright correctly highlights the filter control but attempts to perform the click elsewhere, resulting in the error: "intercepts pointer events". 

Here is the trace output:

### Additional Notes
I suspect that this issue may be related to Chromium rather than Playwright, but I am unable to determine the root cause beyond this point.
