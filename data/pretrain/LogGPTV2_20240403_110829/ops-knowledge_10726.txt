User: How to use Python to write a task scheduler to achieve the purpose of automatically executing scheduled tasks?
Assistant: There are various libraries and tools available in Python to write task schedulers, two of the most commonly used are APScheduler and Celery. 1. Use APSchedulerAPScheduler is a simple task scheduling library, which is very convenient to use. The purpose of automatically executing planned tasks can be realized. The sample code is as follows: ```from apscheduler.schedulers.blocking import BlockingScheduler from datetime import datetimedef job(): print('Hello World!', datetime.now())scheduler = BlockingScheduler()scheduler.add_job(job, 'interval' , minutes=1) #Execute a task every minute scheduler.start()```This code defines a task scheduler, which contains a scheduled task, which will be scheduled for execution every minute. Different scheduled tasks can be achieved by adding more tasks. Refer to the official documentation of APScheduler for more operating instructions. 2. Use Celery Celery is a more powerful task queue tool that can achieve more complex task scheduling and distributed execution. The sample code is as follows: First, you need to install Celery and Redis```pip install celerypip install redis``````from celery import Celery from datetime import datetimeapp = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/ 0')@app.taskdef job(): print('Hello World!', datetime.now())```This code defines a Celery task, which can be used to call very complex tasks, including distributed perform tasks. It should be noted that Celery needs to use message queues to implement task distribution and execution, so message queue tools such as Redis need to be installed, and Celery's Broker properties must be set. Implementing a task scheduler requires writing more code to define tasks and add them to the Celery queue. For specific operations, please refer to the official Celery documentation.
