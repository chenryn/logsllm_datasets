### Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management (C-SCRM) Practices for Systems and Organizations

#### 2.3.1. Overview of C-SCRM Levels

C-SCRM activities should be carried out across three risk management levels, with the overall objective of continuously improving the enterprise’s risk-related activities and ensuring effective communication both within and between these levels. This approach integrates strategic and tactical activities among all stakeholders who share an interest in the mission and business success of the enterprise.

**Key Activities:**
- **Develop C-SCRM plans.**
- **Implement C-SCRM policies and requirements.**
- **Adhere to constraints provided by Level 1 and Level 2.**
- **Tailor C-SCRM to the context of the individual system and apply it throughout the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).**
- **Report on C-SCRM to Level 2.**

This figure illustrates the relationship between key C-SCRM documents across the three levels.

#### 2.3.2. Level 1 – Enterprise

Effective C-SCRM requires commitment, direct involvement, and ongoing support from senior leaders and executives. Enterprises should designate an executive-level individual, office, or group to lead agency-wide SCRM activities, regardless of the specific organizational structure.

**Key Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Executive Oversight:** Establish a governance structure that enables senior leaders and executives to collaborate on C-SCRM.
- **C-SCRM Strategy, Policy, and High-Level Implementation Plan:** Develop and implement these to shape and constrain C-SCRM activities at Level 2 and Level 3.
- **Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Council:** Form an ERM council to evaluate and mitigate risks across the enterprise, involving key leaders such as the CEO, CRO, CIO, CLO, CISO, and CAO.
- **C-SCRM Council:** Create a dedicated body to provide in-depth analysis and inform the executive board’s ERM council.
- **Risk Framing:** Define assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, and priorities that guide C-SCRM decisions.
- **C-SCRM Policy:** Establish the program's purpose, outline responsibilities, define roles, and set compliance expectations.
- **Risk Assessment:** Assess, respond to, and monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.
- **Reporting:** Provide reports on the implementation, effectiveness, and conditions related to C-SCRM.

#### 2.3.3. Level 2 – Mission and Business Process

Level 2 addresses how the enterprise mission and business processes assess, respond to, and monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Activities are performed in accordance with the C-SCRM strategy and policies provided by Level 1.

**Key Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Mission and Business Process Representatives:** Include program managers, research and development, and acquisitions/procurement.
- **Tailored Strategies and Policies:** Develop specific strategies, policies, and procedures to fit the requirements of each mission and business process.
- **Third-Party Relationships:** Manage relationships with suppliers, developers, system integrators, and other service providers.
- **Risk Assessment:** Tailor and apply the enterprise’s C-SCRM frame to fit the specific threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, and likelihoods.
- **C-SCRM Implementation Plan:** Develop and execute a detailed plan for operationalizing the C-SCRM strategy.
- **Reporting:** Provide metrics and insights to manage C-SCRM within the scope of the mission and business processes.

#### 2.3.4. Level 3 – Operational

Level 3 is comprised of personnel responsible for operational activities, including conducting procurements and executing system-related C-SCRM activities as part of the SDLC.

**Key Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Operational Personnel:** Include system owners, contracting officers, architects, system engineers, information security specialists, and developers.
- **C-SCRM Plans:** Develop and implement plans that address the management, implementation assurance, and monitoring of C-SCRM controls.
- **Risk Assessment and Response:** Analyze the likelihood and impact of potential supply chain cybersecurity threats and select, tailor, and monitor C-SCRM controls.
- **Reporting:** Focus on the implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, and overall level of exposure to cybersecurity risks for the particular system.
- **Continuous Hygiene:** Maintain and regularly review the C-SCRM plan to ensure continuous monitoring of implemented controls.

#### 2.3.5. C-SCRM Program Management Office (PMO)

A C-SCRM PMO can facilitate C-SCRM activities across the enterprise and its mission and business processes. The PMO acts as a service provider, offering a range of beneficial services:

**Services Provided by the C-SCRM PMO:**
- **Advisory Services and Subject Matter Expertise**
- **Chair for Internal C-SCRM Working Groups and Coordination Bodies**
- **Centralized Hub for Tools, Job Aids, Awareness, and Training Templates**
- **Supplier and Product Risk Assessments**
- **Liaison to External Stakeholders**
- **Information-Sharing Management**
- **Management of C-SCRM Risk Register**
- **Secretariat/Staffing Function for Enterprise C-SCRM Governance**
- **C-SCRM Project and Performance Management**
- **C-SCRM Briefings, Presentations, and Reporting**

The C-SCRM PMO typically consists of C-SCRM subject matter experts (SMEs) and may include or report to a dedicated executive-level official. The PMO should consist of dedicated personnel or matrixed representatives from various enterprise processes, including information security, procurement, risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, and HR.
