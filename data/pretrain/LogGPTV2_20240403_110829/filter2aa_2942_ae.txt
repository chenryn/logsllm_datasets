etc. 
• Develop C-SCRM plans. 
• Implement C-SCRM 
policies and 
requirements. 
• Adhere to constraints 
provided by Level 1 and 
Level 2.  
• Tailor C-SCRM to the 
context of the individual 
system, and apply it 
throughout the SDLC.  
• Report on C-SCRM to 
Level 2.  
The C-SCRM process should be carried out across the three risk management levels with the 
overall objective of continuous improvement of the enterprise’s risk-related activities and 
effective inter- and intra-level communication, thus integrating both strategic and tactical 
activities among all stakeholders with a shared interest in the mission and business success of the 
enterprise. Whether addressing a component, system, process, mission process, or policy, it is 
important to engage the relevant C-SCRM stakeholders at each level to ensure that risk 
management activities are as informed as possible. Figure 2-5 illustrates the relationship between 
key C-SCRM documents across the three levels.

The next few sections provide example roles and activities at each level. Because every 
enterprise is different, however, activities may be performed at different levels than listed and as 
individual enterprise context requires. 
2.3.2. Level 1 – Enterprise 
Effective C-SCRM requires commitment, direct involvement, and ongoing support from senior 
leaders and executives. Enterprises should designate the responsibility for leading agency-wide 
SCRM activities to an executive-level individual, office (supported by an expert staff), or group 
(e.g., a risk board, executive steering committee, or executive leadership council) regardless of 
an agency’s specific organizational structure. Because cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain can be present across every major business line, enterprises should ensure that C-SCRM 
Appendix A provides a number of mission and business C-SCRM controls that organizations 
can utilize in a tailored capacity to help guide Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 C-SCRM 
activities. Note that the tailoring should be scoped to the organization’s risk management 
needs, and organizations should analyze the cost of not implementing C-SCRM policies, 
capabilities, and controls when evaluating alternative risk response courses of action. These 
costs may include poor quality or counterfeit products, supplier misuse of intellectual 
property, supplier tampering with or compromise of mission-critical information, and 
exposure to cyber attacks through vulnerable supplier information systems.

roles and responsibilities are defined for senior leaders who participate in supply chain activities 
(e.g., acquisition and procurement, information security, information technology, legal, program 
management, and supply chain and logistics). Without establishing executive oversight of C-
SCRM activities, enterprises are limited in their ability to make risk decisions across the 
organization about how to effectively secure their product and services.  
Level 1 (Enterprise) sets the tone and direction for enterprise-wide C-SCRM activities by 
providing an overarching C-SCRM strategy, a C-SCRM policy, and a High-level 
Implementation Plan that shapes how C-SCRM is implemented across the enterprise. Within 
Level-1, governance structures are formed to enable senior leaders and executives to collaborate 
on C-SCRM with the risk executive (function), make C-SCRM decisions, delegate decisions to 
Level 2 and Level 3, and prioritize enterprise-wide resource allocation for C-SCRM. Level 1 
activities help to ensure that C-SCRM mitigation strategies are consistent with the strategic goals 
and objectives of the enterprise. Level 1 activities culminate in the C-SCRM Strategy, Policy, 
and High-Level Implementation Plan that shape and constrain how C-SCRM is carried out at 
Level 2 and Level 3. 
C-SCRM requires accountability, commitment, oversight, direct involvement, and ongoing 
support from senior leaders and executives. Enterprises should ensure that C-SCRM roles and 
responsibilities are defined for senior leaders who participate in supply chain activities (e.g., 
acquisition and procurement, information security, information technology, legal, program 
management, and supply chain and logistics). At Level 1, an executive board is typically 
responsible for evaluating and mitigating all risks across the enterprise. This is generally 
achieved through an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) council. Effective C-SCRM gathers 
perspectives from leaders, all generally within the ERM council – such as the chief executive 
officer (CEO), chief risk officer (CRO), chief information officer (CIO), chief legal officer 
(CLO)/general counsel, chief information security officer (CISO), and chief acquisition officer 
(CAO) – and informs advice and recommendations from the CIO and CISO to the executive 
board.  
CIOs and/or CISOs may form a C-SCRM oriented-body to provide in-depth analysis to inform 
the executive board’s ERM council. The C-SCRM council serves as a forum for setting priorities 
and managing cybersecurity risk in the supply chain for the enterprise. The C-SCRM council or 
Ownership and accountability for cybersecurity risks in the supply chain ultimately lie with 
the head of the organization. 
• Decision-makers are informed by an organization’s risk profile, risk appetite, and risk 
tolerance levels. Processes should address when and how the escalation of risk 
decisions needs to occur. 
• Ownership should be delegated to authorizing officials within the agency based on 
their executive authority over organizational missions, business operations, or 
information systems. 
• Authorizing officials may further delegate responsibilities to designated officials who 
are responsible for the day-to-day management of risk.

other C-SCRM-oriented body are responsible for developing the C-SCRM enterprise-wide 
strategy. The C-SCRM strategy makes explicit the enterprise’s assumptions, constraints, risk 
tolerances, and priorities/trade-offs as established by the ERM council. C-SCRM is integrated 
into the organization’s overall enterprise risk management through the CIO and/or CISO 
membership within the executive board’s ERM council.  
These leaders are also responsible and accountable for developing and promulgating a holistic 
set of policies that span the enterprise’s mission and business processes, guiding the 
establishment and maturation of a C-SCRM capability and the implementation of a cohesive set 
of C-SCRM activities. Leaders should establish a C-SCRM PMO or other dedicated C-SCRM-
related function to drive C-SCRM activities and serve as a fulcrum for coordinated, C-SCRM-
oriented services and guidance to the enterprise. Leaders should also clearly articulate the lead 
roles at the mission and business process level that are responsible and accountable for detailing 
action plans and executing C-SCRM activities. Enterprises should consider that without 
establishing executive oversight of C-SCRM activities, enterprises are limited in their ability to 
make risk decisions across the organization about how to effectively secure their product and 
services.   
The C-SCRM governance structures and operational model dictate the authority, responsibility, 
and decision-making power for C-SCRM and define how C-SCRM processes are accomplished 
within the enterprise. The best C-SCRM governance and operating model is one that meets the 
business and functional requirements of the enterprise. For example, an enterprise facing strict 
budgetary constraints or stiff C-SCRM requirements may consider governance and operational 
models that centralize the decision-making authority and rely on a C-SCRM PMO to consolidate 
responsibilities for resource-intensive tasks, such as vendor risk assessments. In contrast, 
enterprises that have mission and business processes governed with a high degree of autonomy 
or that possess highly differentiated C-SCRM requirements may opt for decentralized authority, 
responsibilities, and decision-making power. 
In addition to defining C-SCRM governance structures and operating models, Level 1 carries out 
the activities necessary to frame C-SCRM for the enterprise. C-SCRM framing is the process by 
which the enterprise makes explicit the assumptions about cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain (e.g., threats, vulnerabilities, risk impact,21 risk likelihood), constraints (e.g., 
enterprise policies, regulations, resource limitation, etc.), appetite and tolerance, and priorities 
and trade-offs that guide C-SCRM decisions across the enterprise. The risk framing process 
provides the inputs necessary to establish the C-SCRM strategy that dictates how the enterprise 
plans to assess, respond to, and monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. A high-
level implementation plan should also be developed to guide the execution of the enterprise’s C-
SCRM strategy. The risk framing process is discussed in further detail in Appendix C.  
Informed by the risk framing process and the C-SCRM strategy, Level 1 provides the 
enterprise’s C-SCRM policy. The C-SCRM policy establishes the C-SCRM program’s purpose, 
outlines the enterprise’s C-SCRM responsibilities, defines and grants authority to C-SCRM roles 
across the enterprise, and outlines applicable C-SCRM compliance and enforcement expectations 
21 Risk impact refers to the effect on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation (including the 
national security interests of the United States) of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or a system [800-53 R5].

and processes. Appendix C provides example templates for the C-SCRM Strategy and C-SCRM 
Policy.  
Risk assessment activities performed at Level 1 focus on assessing, responding to, and 
monitoring cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Level 1 risk assessments may be 
based on the enterprise’s Level 1 Frame step (i.e., assumptions, constraints, appetite, tolerances, 
priorities, and trade-offs) or may be aggregated enterprise-level assumptions based on risk 
assessments that are completed across multiple mission and business processes. For example, a 
Level 1 risk assessment may assess the exposure to threats to enterprise objectives that arise 
through supply chain products or services. Level 1 risk assessments may also aim to aggregate 
and recontextualize risk assessments completed at Level 2 to describe risk scenarios against the 
enterprise’s primary objectives.  
Reporting plays an important role in equipping Level 1 decision-makers with the context 
necessary to make informed decisions on how to manage cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain. Reporting should focus on enterprise-wide trends and include coverage of the 
extent to which C-SCRM has been implemented across the enterprise, the effectiveness of C-
SCRM, and the conditions related to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. C-SCRM 
reports should highlight any conditions that require urgent leadership attention and/or action and 
may benefit from highlighted C-SCRM risk and performance trends over a period of time. Those 
responsible and accountable for C-SCRM within the enterprise should work with leaders to 
identify reporting requirements, such as frequency, scope, and format. Reporting should include 
metrics discussed further in Section 3.5.1.   
Level 1 activities ultimately provide the overarching context and boundaries within which the 
enterprise’s mission and business processes manage cybersecurity risks throughout the supply 
chain. Outputs from Level 1 (e.g., C-SCRM Strategy, C-SCRM Policy, Governance, and 
Operating Model) are further tailored and refined within Level 2 to fit the context of each 
mission and business process. Level 1 outputs should also be iteratively informed by and updated 
as a result of C-SCRM outputs at lower levels.  
Note that, in complex enterprises, Level 1 activities may be completed at an enterprise level and 
at an individual organization level. Enterprise Level 1 activities should shape and guide 
Organization Level 1 activities.

2.3.3. Level 2 – Mission and Business Process 
Level 2 addresses how the enterprise mission and business processes assess, respond to, and 
monitor cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. Level 2 activities are performed in 
accordance with the C-SCRM strategy and policies provided by Level 1.22 In this level, process-
specific C-SCRM strategies, policies, and implementation plans dictate how the enterprise’s C-

SCRM goals and requirements are met within each mission and business process. Here, specific 
C-SCRM program requirements are defined and managed and include cost, schedule, 
performance, security, and a variety of critical non-functional requirements. These non-
functional requirements include concepts such as reliability, dependability, safety, security, and 
quality.  
Level 2 roles include representatives of each mission and business process, such as program 
managers, research and development, and acquisitions/procurement. Level 2 C-SCRM activities 
address C-SCRM within the context of the enterprise’s mission and business process. Specific 
strategies, policies, and procedures should be developed to tailor the C-SCRM implementation to 
fit the specific requirements of each mission and business process. In order to further develop the 
high-level Enterprise Strategy and Implementation Plan, different mission areas or business lines 
within the enterprise may need to generate their own tailored mission and business-level strategy 
and implementation plan, and they should ensure that C-SCRM execution occurs within the 
constraints defined by higher level C-SCRM strategies and in conformance C-SCRM policies. 
To facilitate the development and execution of Level 2 Strategy and Implementation plans, 
enterprises may benefit from forming a committee with representation from each mission and 
business process. Coordination and collaboration between the mission and business processes 
can help drive risk awareness, identify cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain, and 
support the development of an enterprise and C-SCRM architecture. A C-SCRM PMO may also 
assist in the implementation of C-SCRM at Level 2 through the provision of services (e.g., policy 
templates, C-SCRM subject matter expert [SME] support). 
Many threats to and through the supply chain are addressed at Level 2 in the management of 
third-party relationships with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Because C-SCRM can both directly and 
indirectly impact mission processes, understanding, integrating, and coordinating C-SCRM 
activities at this level are critical. Level 2 activities focus on tailoring and applying the 
enterprise’s C-SCRM frame to fit the specific mission and business process threats, 
vulnerabilities, impacts,23 and likelihoods. Informed by outputs from Level 1 (e.g., C-SCRM 
strategy), mission and business processes will adopt a C-SCRM strategy that tailors the 
enterprise’s overall strategy to a specific mission and business process. At Level 2, the enterprise 
may also issue mission and business process-specific policies that contextualize the enterprise’s 
policy for the process.  
In accordance with the C-SCRM strategy, enterprise leaders for specific mission and business 
processes should develop and execute a C-SCRM implementation plan. The C-SCRM 
implementation plan provides a more detailed roadmap for operationalizing the C-SCRM 
strategy within the mission and business process. Within the C-SCRM implementation plans, the 
mission and business process will specify C-SCRM roles, responsibilities, implementation 
milestones, dates, and processes for monitoring and reporting. Appendix D of this document 
23 These impacts refer to the effects on organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation (including 
the national security interests of the United States) of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or a system [SP 800-53, 
Rev. 5].

provides example templates for the C-SCRM Strategy, Implementation Plan, and the C-SCRM 
Policy. 
C-SCRM activities performed at Level 2 focus on assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk 
exposure arising from the mission and business process dependencies on suppliers, developers, 
system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service 
providers. Risk exposures to the supply chain may occur as a result of primary dependencies on 
the supply chain or secondary dependencies on individual information systems or other mission 
and business processes. For example, risk exposure may arise due to a supplier providing critical 
system components or services to multiple information systems on which critical processes 
depend. Risk may also arise from vendor-sourced products and services unrelated to information 
systems, as well as the roles that these products and services play in the overall mission and 
business process objectives. Enterprises should consider non-traditional sources of cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain. These risks may circumvent or escape C-SCRM processes, 
such as those arising from the use of open source software. Enterprises should establish policies 
and controls to manage non-traditional cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain.  
Reporting at Level 2 plays an important role in equipping mission and business process leaders 
with the context necessary to manage C-SCRM within the scope of their mission and business 
processes. Topics covered at Level 2 will reflect those covered at Level 1 but should be reshaped 
to focus on the specific mission and business process that they correspond to. Level 2 reporting 
should include metrics that demonstrate the mission and business process performance in 
contrast to the enterprise-defined risk appetite and risk tolerance statements defined at Level 1 
and Level 2. Reporting requirements should be defined to fit the needs of leaders in mission and 
business processes and at Level 1.  
Outputs from Level 2 activities will significantly impact how C-SCRM activities are carried out 
at Level 3. For example, risk tolerance and common control baseline decisions may be defined at 
Level 2 then tailored and applied within the context of individual information systems at Level 3. 
Level 2 outputs should also be used to iteratively influence and further refine Level 1 outputs.  
Additional information can be found in Appendix A of this document and SR-1, SR-3, SR-6, PM-
2, PM-6, PM-7, PM-30, PM-31, and PM-32 of NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5. 
2.3.4. Level 3 – Operational 
Level 3 is comprised of personnel responsible and accountable for operational activities, 
including conducting procurements and executing system-related C-SCRM activities as part of 
the enterprise’s SDLC, which includes research and development, design, manufacturing, 
delivery, integration, operations and maintenance, and the disposal/retirement of systems. These 
personnel include system owners, contracting officers, contracting officer representatives, 
architects, system engineers, information security specialists, system integrators, and developers. 
These personnel are responsible for developing C-SCRM plans that address the management, 
implementation assurance, and monitoring of C-SCRM controls (to include those applicable to 
external parties, such as contractors) and the acquisition, development, and sustainment of 
systems and components across the SDLC to support mission and business processes. In

enterprises where a C-SCRM PMO has been established, activities such as product risk 
assessments may be provided as a centralized, shared service.  
Within Level 3, outputs provided by C-SCRM activities completed at Level 1 and Level 2 
prepare the enterprise to execute C-SCRM at the operational level in accordance with the RMF 
[NIST 800-37r2]. C-SCRM is applied to information systems through the development and 
implementation of C-SCRM plans. These plans are heavily influenced by assumptions, 
constraints, risk appetite and tolerance, priorities, and trade-offs defined by Level 1 and Level 2. 
C-SCRM plans dictate how C-SCRM activities are integrated into all systems in the SDLC: 
acquisition (both custom and off-the-shelf), requirements, architectural design, development, 
delivery, installation, integration, maintenance, and disposal/retirement. In general, C-SCRM 
plans are implementation-specific and provide policy implementation, requirements, constraints, 
and implications for systems that support mission and business processes.   
Level 3 activities focus on managing operational-level risk exposure resulting from any ICT/OT-
related products and services provided through the supply chain that are in use by the enterprise 
or fall within the scope of the systems authorization boundary. Level 3 C-SCRM activities begin 
with an analysis of the likelihood and impact of potential supply chain cybersecurity threats 
exploiting an operational-level vulnerability (e.g., in a system or system component). Where 
applicable, these risk assessments should be informed by risk assessments completed in Level 1 
and Level 2. In response to determining risk, enterprises should evaluate alternative courses of 
action for reducing risk exposure (e.g., accept, avoid, mitigate, share, and/or transfer). Risk 
response is achieved by selecting, tailoring, implementing, and monitoring C-SCRM controls 
throughout the SLDC in accordance with the RMF [NIST 800-37r2]. Selected C-SCRM controls 
often consist of a combination of inherited common controls from the Level 1 and Level 2 and 
information system-specific controls at Level 3.   
Reporting at Level 3 should focus on the C-SCRM’s implementation, efficiency, effectiveness, 
and the overall level of exposure to cybersecurity risks in the supply chain for the particular 
system. System-level reporting should provide system owners with tactical-level insights that 
enable them to make rapid adjustments and respond to risk conditions. Level 3 reporting should 
include metrics that demonstrate performance against the enterprise risk appetite statements and 
risk tolerance statements defined at Levels 1, 2, and 3.  
A critical Level 3 activity is the development of the C-SCRM plan. Along with applicable 
security control information, the C-SCRM plan includes information on the system, its 
categorization, operational status, related agreements, architecture, critical system personnel, 
related laws, regulations, policies, and contingency plan. In C-SCRM, continuous hygiene is 
critical, and the C-SCRM plan is a living document that should be maintained and used as the 
reference for the continuous monitoring of implemented C-SCRM controls. C-SCRM plans are 
intended to be referenced regularly and should be reviewed and refreshed periodically. These are 
not intended to be documents developed to satisfy a compliance requirement. Rather, enterprises 
should be able to demonstrate how they have historically and continue to effectively employ 
their plans to shape, align, inform, and take C-SCRM actions and decisions across all three 
levels.

activities completed within Level 1 and Level 2 to further refine C-SCRM strategies and 
implementation plans.

2.3.5. C-SCRM PMO 
A variety of operating models (e.g., centralized, decentralized, hybrid) facilitate C-SCRM 
activities across the enterprise and its mission and business processes. One such model involves 
concentrating and assigning responsibilities for certain C-SCRM activities to a central PMO. In 
this model, the C-SCRM PMO acts as a service provider to other mission and business 
processes. Mission and business processes are then responsible for selecting and requesting 
services from the C-SCRM PMO as part of their responsibilities to meet the enterprise’s C-
SCRM goals and objectives. There are a variety of beneficial services that a PMO may provide:   
• Advisory services and subject matter expertise 
• Chair for internal C-SCRM working groups, council, or other coordination bodies 
• Centralized hub for tools, job aids, awareness, and training templates 
• Supplier and product risk assessments  
• Liaison to external stakeholders 
• Information-sharing management (e.g., intra department/agency and to/from FASC) 
• Management of C-SCRM risk register 
• Secretariat/staffing function for enterprise C-SCRM governance 
• C-SCRM project and performance management 
• C-SCRM briefings, presentations, and reporting   
A C-SCRM PMO typically consists of C-SCRM SMEs who help drive the C-SCRM strategy 
and implementation across the enterprise and its mission and business processes. A C-SCRM 
PMO may include or report to a dedicated executive-level official responsible and accountable 
for overseeing C-SCRM activities across the enterprise. A C-SCRM PMO should consist of 
dedicated personnel or include matrixed representatives with responsibilities for C-SCRM from 
several of the enterprise’s processes, including information security, procurement, risk 
management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, and HR. Regardless of whether a C-
