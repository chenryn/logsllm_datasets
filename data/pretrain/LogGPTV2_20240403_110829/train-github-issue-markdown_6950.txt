**What happened** :  
`cluster/gce/util.sh` uses the `gcloud` cli a lot and does a `gcloud
components update` (in the commonly used function `verify-prereqs`) before
doing things like `kube-down`. `gcloud` updates can introduce breaking changes
(for example in the recent 132.0.0 release it removed a bunch of flags). This
has caused cross-the-board test failures like #35654.
But this is not limited to just tests. Any kubernetes GCE users who rely on
the `kube-up` and `kube-down` commands could have been broken.
**What you expected to happen** :
Stop updating gcloud automatically. We could either warn user to have the
required dependencies installed, or pin to specific versions of dependencies
like gcloud.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
download 1.4.4 release tarball  
run `kube-up` and `kube-down`
