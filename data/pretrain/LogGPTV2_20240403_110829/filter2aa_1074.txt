### Trooping to Taiwan: Technical Sophistication and Connections in Closed Espionage Ecosystems
**Author:** Matt Brooks, Citizen Lab

#### Campaign Overview
- **Campaign Success:**
  - At least one target was compromised.
  - An interesting post-compromise tactic was observed.
  - The campaign may have employed advanced detection avoidance techniques.
  - There was a possible improvement in the server-side component.
  - A hand-off to another actor or system was noted.

- **Campaign Takeaways:**
  - The campaign largely relied on publicly available content.
  - Excellent social engineering tactics were used, but the technical sophistication was average.
  - No zero-day vulnerabilities were exploited.
  - Custom implants were utilized.
  - Despite the average technical level, the campaign was still successful.

#### Connections
- **First Order:**
  - Directly observed connections.
- **Second Order:**
  - Infrastructure-based connections.
- **Nth Order:**
  - Potential code reuse.
  - Shared development techniques.
  - Uncommon naming conventions.

#### Challenges
- **Closed Espionage Ecosystems:**
  - These ecosystems make it difficult to accurately segment and describe the harms caused by various actors.
  - Future work could focus on formal methods to better understand and map these connections.

#### Case Study: Su Bin
- **Arrested:** June 28, 2014
- **Sentenced:** July 13, 2016
- **Collaborators:** Worked with two unnamed co-conspirators to identify and sell information stolen through malware intrusions.
- **Insight:** This case provides a glimpse into the resources and capabilities of individuals and organizations involved in malware intrusions.

#### Parting Thoughts
- **Public Tools:**
  - There are enough public, basic tools available that even average actors can cause significant harm.
- **Future Work:**
  - More research is needed on formal methods and campaign connections within closed espionage ecosystems.

#### Civil Society Coordination Problem
- **Victims to Researchers:**
  - **Awareness:** Victims often lack awareness of the risks and how to seek help.
  - **Lack of Trusted Contacts:** Victims may not know who to trust.
  - **Privacy Concerns:** Victims may be hesitant to share sensitive information.
  - **Researcher Incentives:** Researchers may have different motivations and priorities.

- **Researchers to Victims:**
  - **“Nexus-Only” Knowledge:** Researchers may only have partial knowledge.
  - **Lack of Trusted Contacts:** Researchers may struggle to find reliable contacts.
  - **Cannot Close the Loop:** It can be challenging to provide complete support to victims.
  - **Investigative Concerns:** Ongoing investigations may limit the information researchers can share.

#### The Public’s Problem
- **Public Interest:**
  - The public interest lies in maintaining a safe, healthy, and fully-functioning society.
- **Role of Civil Society:**
  - Civil Society has long played a crucial role in pushing societal limits.
- **Importance of the Internet:**
  - The internet plays an increasingly critical role in modern life.
- **Awareness:**
  - Raising awareness about the impacts of targeted surveillance on civil society organizations (CSOs) is essential.
