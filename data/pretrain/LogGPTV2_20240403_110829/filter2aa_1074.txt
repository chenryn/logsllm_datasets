Conclusion
Parting Thoughts
● There are enough public, basic tools enabling average actors 
to cause harm
● Closed espionage ecosystems make it difficult to accurately 
segment and describe harms
● Interesting future work to be done on formal methods and 
campaign connections
Civil Society Coordination Problem
Victims -> Researchers
● Awareness
● Lack of trusted contacts
● Privacy concerns
● Researcher incentives
Researchers -> Victims
● “Nexus-only” knowledge
● Lack of trusted contacts
● Cannot close the loop
● Investigative concerns
The Public’s Problem
● The public interest is in having a safe, healthy, and 
fully-functioning society
● Civil Society has long been a part of pushing societal limits
● Internet plays an increasingly critical role
● Awareness of targeted surveillance impacts to CSOs is 
important
