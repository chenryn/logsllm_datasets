User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nagiosgraph mouseover fails I have setup Nagios 4 together with Nagiosgraph and they are both working perfect.

However the javascript Mouseover effect does not work.

I have copied the following line in ../nagios/share/ssi/common-header.ssi as mentioned in Nagiosgraph Documentation and it is the only line:

&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/nagiosgraph/nagiosgraph.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


However when I make a Mouseover effect over the Nagiosgraph icon I get the following error in apache error.log: 

[Thu Nov 27 11:48:21 2014] [error]  ../nagios/share/ssi/common-header.ssi: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `&lt;'
[Thu Nov 27 11:48:21 2014] [error]  ../nagios/share/ssi/common-header.ssi: line 1: `&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="/nagiosgraph/nagiosgraph.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;'


Are there any ideas on how to resolve this?

Assistant: Finally managed to resolve the issue.
The following steps should be followed:


The ../nagios/share/ssi/common-header.ssi file should be in shell script format:

 #!/bin/bash
 echo "&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/nagios/nagiosgraph.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;"

Also the file ../nagios/share/ssi/common-header.ssi should be readable and executable, which means I had to run the following command:

chmod a+rx common-header.ssi
