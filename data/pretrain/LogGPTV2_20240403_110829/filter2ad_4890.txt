Authenticating a Message
We are interested in securing interactions with a 
server via an work station using a mobile device.

However, it does not verify the transaction 
content, thus the work station is able to 
modify the transaction.

Related Work
• [Clarke2002] : Capture every pixel and verify 
the pixels (or perform OCR and verify the 
message) with a MAC barcode on the screen.

Two Adversary Models
• Model 1: the mobile device is honest the 
terminal is could be compromised, we want to 
achieve confidentiality and authenticity;
• Model 2: both the mobile device and the 
terminal could be compromised, but they 
cannot collude, we want to achieve 
authenticity.

Model 1 (Mobile Device is Honest)
Sensitive 
information to 
be presented 
to the user.

Model 1 Solution
Transaction Date

Description
Amount
(1)Non sensitive 
portions will be 
displayed as they 
are.  
(2) Sensitive 
information are 
replaced by specially 
designed 2D 
barcodes.

(1)User verifies the 
order of the barcodes.
(2) User moves the 
mobile device over the 
barcode.
(3) Mobile device 
captures and verifies 
the barcodes, and 
displays the content.

Model 2 (Both Could Cheat)
Information 
which requires 
protection on 
authenticity.

Model 2 Solution
The transaction 
information is 
displayed together 
with their barcodes.

Model 2 Solution
(1)User verifies the 
order of the barcodes.
(2) User moves the 
mobile device over 
the barcode.
(3) Mobile device 
captures and verifies 
the barcodes, and 
displays the content.
(4) User verifies the 
transactions are 
consistent in device 
and work station.

Rearrangement Attacks
ACSAC 2010

Sub-Region Authentication
• Capture and decode one small region at a time.
– It is subjected to rearrange/delete/duplicate attack
• Hardware limitation of mobile’s camera
– It cannot capture a whole screen with sufficient 
precision.
• Sub-region authentication problem: 
– how to authenticate the whole message using a 
device that can only verify one small region at a time.

Visual Inspection of Visual Cues
• Idea: bind the location information to the 
appearance of the barcodes.
• Example:
Last block of
the line

Our Design
• The arrangement is derived from session key.  
Hence, a malicious terminal who change a 
Black L-block to  White L-block has 3/4 chance 
of introducing error. 
• To change the visual appearance, the 
adversary will need to change many L-blocks. 
This will destroy the barcode with high 
probability.

Alternative 1
• Use camera as a channel to send everything, 
then start browsing in mobile device.
(1) Less user-friendly 
to browse with 
small display.
(2) Not easy to extend 
to cater dishonest 
mobile device.

Alternative 2
• Store location information (e.g. row names, 
column names) in the payload.  
(1) Not easy to 
prevent deletion 
and duplication 
attacks.
(2) Only applicable for 
some table data.

Comparison with Existing Work
• It can:
– authenticate transaction content,
– provide confidentiality when mobile is trusted.
• It requires:
– mobile device has camera and display.
• It does NOT require:
– installation in work station;
– out-of-band channel;
– mobile device to be trusted when confidentiality is 
not required.

Proof-of-Concept Implementation
Programmed using Android API 1.6.
Tested on 3 phones: Acer Liquid, Motorola Milestone XT, HTC Legend;
Tested on 3 monitors:
• An 19 inch at TFT monitor in Dell model Optiplex 755; 
• A 13.3 inches display of a Toshiba portege M900 laptop; 
• A 15 inch Dell CRT monitor.

Performance
• Decoding rate:  around 5 frames per second. 
• Bit error rate:
• A barcode of 50 by 50 can carry around 952 
bits message, and is able to correct 8% errors.

Proof-of-Concept Demo
• Proof-of-concept program running on Acer Liquid 
model,
• the webpage is render in a Dell model “Optiplex 755”, 
19 inch TFT monitor. 
• To improve user experience, 
we employ augmented 
reality framework, instead 
of requiring the user to 
manually take pictures.

Conclusions and Future works
• We designed a visual cue technique and show 
that this technique can help securing interactions.
• Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that 
such system is feasible to run in mobile devices.
• Our solution serves as an interesting example 
where authentication is carried out by coupling 
computer processing power and human 
perceptual system. 
• The visual cue technique could potentially have 
other applications.
