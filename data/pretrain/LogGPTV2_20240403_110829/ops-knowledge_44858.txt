User: I'm new to using mac and tornado. I have installed easy_install and tried installing tornado but I am keep getting "Permission denied"
easy_install tornado
Searching for tornado
Best match: tornado 2.3
Processing tornado-2.3-py2.7.egg
Adding tornado 2.3 to easy-install.pth file
error: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/easy-install.pth: Permission denied
What is going wrong?
Assistant: You might want to try running that command as root if you want to install tornado system-wide or take a look at virtualenv for installing python packages in a sandboxed environment. Also, I recommend pythonbrew if you want to experiment with various versions of Python.
