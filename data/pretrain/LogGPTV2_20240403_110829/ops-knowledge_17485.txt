User: I'm new to Python (relatively new to programing in general) and I have created a small python script that scrape some data off of a site once a week and stores it to a local database (I'm trying to do some statistical analysis on downloaded music). I've tested it on my Mac and would like to put it up onto my server (VPS with WiredTree running CentOS 5), but I have no idea where to start.
I tried Googling for it, but apparently I'm using the wrong terms as "deploying" means to create an executable file. The only thing that seems to make sense is to set it up inside Django, but I think that might be overkill. I don't know...
EDIT: More clarity
Assistant: Copy script to server
test script manually on server
set cron, "crontab -e" to a value that will test it soon
once you've debugged issues set cron to the appropriate time.
