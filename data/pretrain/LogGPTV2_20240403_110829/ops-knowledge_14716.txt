User:  In a high concurrent web application, how to deal with the database deadlock problem?
Assistant: Here are some ways to deal with database deadlocks: 1. Increase the size of the database connection pool to reduce the probability of database connection timeouts, thereby reducing the probability of deadlocks. 2. Use the "lock timeout" mechanism in the database to automatically terminate a deadlocked transaction when the lock times out. 3. Avoid deadlocks by having transactions request locks in the same order. This approach ensures that each transaction requests locks in a specific order and prevents two transactions from simultaneously requesting the same resource from deadlocking while waiting for each other to complete. 4. Handle deadlocks at the code level of the application. For example, after catching a deadlock exception, one of the transactions can be rolled back and tried again. 5. When designing the database structure, consider using fewer indexes. Multiple indexes will increase the lock time of write operations, bringing the risk of deadlock. 6. Use the database's own cluster and distributed functions to distribute the transactions that lock different resources to different nodes, thereby reducing the probability of deadlock.
