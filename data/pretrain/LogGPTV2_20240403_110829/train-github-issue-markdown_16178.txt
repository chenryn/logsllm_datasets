When tooltip is active/focused and `destroy` event is called the tooltip gets
opacity 0, but still clickable and its element still in the DOM.
It's reproduced in this example: http://jsfiddle.net/jeRub/  
When test button is clicked the tooltip gets "destroyed", but it still in the
DOM and blocks click events on the text input.
