Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```plaintext
Log Entry:
- Timestamp: 1118193358

- Node: R11-M0-NC-I:J18-U01

- Component: APP
- Severity: FATAL
- Message: ciod: LOGIN chdir(/p/gb2/glosli/8M_5000K/t800) failed: No such file or directory
```

This format clearly separates each piece of information, making it easier to read and understand.
