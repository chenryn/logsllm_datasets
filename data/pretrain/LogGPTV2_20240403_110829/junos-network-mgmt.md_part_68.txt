### Configuration and Verification of Chassis Cluster Redundancy Group

1. **Command Execution:**
   - If the output does not display the intended configuration, repeat the configuration instructions in this example to correct it.
   - For brevity, the `show` command output includes only the configuration relevant to this example. Any other configuration on the system is represented by ellipses (...).

2. **Configuration Example:**
   ```plaintext
   {primary:node0}[edit]
   user@host# show chassis cluster redundancy-group 1
   ip-monitoring {
       global-weight 100;
       global-threshold 200;
       family {
           inet {
               10.1.1.10 {
                   weight 100;
                   interface reth1.0 secondary-ip-address 10.1.1.101;
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Committing the Configuration:**
   - If you are done configuring the device, enter `commit` from configuration mode.

### Verifying the Status of Monitored IP Addresses for a Redundancy Group

**Purpose:**
- Verify the status of monitored IP addresses for a redundancy group.

**Action:**
- From operational mode, enter the `show chassis cluster ip-monitoring status` command.
- For information about a specific group, use the `show chassis cluster ip-monitoring status redundancy-group` command.

**Example Output:**
```plaintext
{primary:node0}
user@host> show chassis cluster ip-monitoring status
node0:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundancy group: 1
Global threshold: 200
Current threshold: -120
IP address    Status    Failure count    Reason    Weight
10.1.1.10     reachable 0                n/a       100
10.1.1.101    reachable 0                n/a       100

node1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Redundancy group: 1
Global threshold: 200
Current threshold: -120
IP address    Status    Failure count    Reason    Weight
10.1.1.10     reachable 0                n/a       100
10.1.1.101    reachable 0                n/a       100
```

### sFlow Monitoring Technology

#### Overview
- **sFlow Technology:** A monitoring technology for high-speed switched or routed networks that collects samples of network packets and sends them in a UDP datagram to a monitoring station (collector).
- **Junos OS Support:** Supports the sFlow standard described in RFC 3176.

#### Sampling Mechanisms
- **Packet-based Sampling:** Samples one packet out of a specified number of packets from an interface enabled for sFlow. Only the first 128 bytes of each packet are sent to the collector.
- **Time-based Sampling:** Samples interface statistics at a specified interval from an interface enabled for sFlow.

#### Benefits
- **Scalability:** Can monitor tens of thousands of switch or router ports simultaneously.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Uses network sampling, which is less resource-intensive and more accurate.

#### sFlow Support on Switches
- **Architecture:** Distributed sFlow architecture with subagents associated with each Packet Forwarding Engine.
- **EX Series Switches:** Recommend configuring the same sample rate for all ports in a line card.

#### sFlow for EVPN-VXLAN
- **QFX10000 Series Switches:** Supports sampling known multicast traffic carried over EVPN-VXLAN.
- **Configuration:** Enable sFlow on the interface in the egress direction and include the `egress-multicast enable` option.

### Example: Configure sFlow for EVPN-VXLAN Networks

#### Requirements
- **Hardware:** QFX10002-60C, QFX10002, QFX10008, or QFX10016 switch.
- **Software:** Junos OS Release 21.3R1, 21.2R2, and later.

#### Overview and Topology
- **Topology:** Figure 31 depicts the sFlow support in an EVPN-VXLAN network environment with an IPv4 underlay.
- **Configuration:** Configure sFlow on the physical port of the hardware switch and logical interface where VTEPs are configured.

#### CLI Quick Configuration
```plaintext
[edit protocols sflow]
set polling-interval 20
set sample-rate ingress 10
set source-ip 10.1.12.0
set collector 10.102.70.200
set interfaces et-0/0/1.1 sample-rate ingress 100 egress 100
```

#### Step-by-Step Procedure
1. **Polling Interval:**
   ```plaintext
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set polling-interval 0
   ```

2. **Ingress Sample Rate:**
   ```plaintext
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set sample-rate ingress 100
   ```

3. **Source IP Address:**
   ```plaintext
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set source-ip 10.1.12.0
   ```

4. **Collector IP Address:**
   ```plaintext
   [edit protocols sflow]
   user@switch# set collector 192.168.200.100
   ```
