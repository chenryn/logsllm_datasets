User: I'm looking to use a local webserver to run a series of python scripts for the user. For various unavoidable reasons, the python script must run locally, not on a server. As a result, I'll be using HTML+browser as the UI, which I'm comfortable with, for the front end.
I've been looking, therefore, for a lightweight web server that can execute python scripts, sitting in the background on a machine, ideally as a Windows service. Security and extensibility are not high priorities as it's all running internally on a small network. 
Should I run a native python webserver as a Windows service (in which case, how)? Or is it just as easy to install Apache onto the user's machine and run as CGI? Since this is all local, performance is not an issue either.
Or am I missing something obvious?
Assistant: Best way is to make your own local server by using command prompt.

Make a new folder say Project
Make a new folder inside project & name it as "cgi-bin"(without quotes)
Paste your .py file inside the cgi-bin folder
Open cmd and change to the directory from which you want to run the server and type "python -m CGIHTTPServer"(without quotes)
Minimize the cmd window & open your browser and type "localhost:8000/cgi-bin/yourpythonfilename.py"(without quotes).
