"B": "The threat model adequately considers all necessary precautions by focusing on password guessing attacks.",
"C": "The threat model has overlooked the potential for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the software used by the storage system.",
"D": "The threat model fails to consider the risk of attackers intercepting file transmissions over the network."
