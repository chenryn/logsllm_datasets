Question: "A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) implementer is deciding on the appropriate tooling for specifying hardware interfaces within an Android environment. They want to ensure that the chosen tooling will allow for efficient and language-independent interface specification. Which tooling should the implementer select and why might the other options not be as suitable?"
 "A": "Java interfaces because they provide a more secure environment for TEE implementation."
 "B": "C++ tooling provided by HIDL as it is expected to be more convenient for TEE implementers."
 "C": "Python tooling because it simplifies the process of code maintainability and readability."
 "D": "Kotlin interfaces as they offer better integration with modern Android development practices."
Answer: B
