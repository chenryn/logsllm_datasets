**ATT&CK ID:** G0139  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** TeamTNT

TeamTNT has achieved persistence by creating a cryptocurrency mining service using `systemctl`.[12][13]

### Explanation:
- **Persistence:** This refers to the technique used by malicious actors to maintain long-term access to a compromised system, even after reboots or other interruptions.
- **Cryptocurrency Mining Service:** A service that runs in the background and uses the victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency, generating profit for the attackers.
- **`systemctl`:** A system and service manager for Linux operating systems. It is used to manage services, including starting, stopping, and enabling them to run at system startup.

By leveraging `systemctl`, TeamTNT ensures that their cryptocurrency mining operation continues to run even after the system is restarted, thus maintaining their presence and ongoing financial gain.
