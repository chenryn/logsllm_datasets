### Discrimination Faced by Tor Exit Relays

**Figure 7a** illustrates the distribution of discrimination (for any interaction) faced by relays from websites in the Alexa Top 500. Our findings indicate that no relay experiences discrimination by more than 32.6% of the 500 websites. However, 50% of the exit relays are discriminated against by more than 27.4% of the 500 websites.

**Figure 7b** shows the distribution of discrimination performed by websites against Tor exit relays. We observe that 51% of the websites discriminate against fewer than 5% of our studied exits, while 11% of websites discriminate against over 70% of our studied exits.

### Factors Associated with Tor Discrimination

To examine various factors associated with Tor discrimination, we note that we did not (and in many cases cannot) randomly assign these factors to websites or relays. Therefore, the associations identified may not be causal.

#### Hosting Provider

**Figure 8** presents the fraction of relays discriminated against by websites hosted on four of the six most-used hosting platforms. We find that Amazon- and Akamai-hosted websites exhibit the most diversity in discrimination policies, suggesting that these websites implement their own individual policies and blacklists. In contrast, CloudFlare has several clusters of websites, each employing a similar blacklisting policy. This pattern aligns with CloudFlare’s move to allow individual website administrators to choose from one of several blocking policies for Tor exit relays [1]. Additionally, 80% of China169- and CloudFlare-hosted websites perform discrimination against at least 60% of our studied relays.

#### Relay Characteristics

Our analysis of the association between exit-relay characteristics and the discrimination faced by them found no significant correlations when accounting for relay openness (fraction of ports for which the exit relay will service requests) or the age of the relay. We observed a small positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.147) between the relay bandwidth and the degree of discrimination faced, but this result was not statistically significant (p-value: 0.152). **Figure 9** graphically represents these results. Further analysis of the impact of relay characteristics on discrimination performed by websites using popular hosting providers revealed that only Amazon has a statistically significant positive correlation between discrimination observed and relay bandwidth (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.247, p-value: 0.015). These results are illustrated in **Figure 10**.

#### Service Category

We analyzed how aggressively different categories of sites—search engines, shopping, news, and social networking—discriminate against Tor exit relays. Using the McAfee URL categorization service [34], we found that search engines are the least likely to discriminate against exit relays, with 83% of all search engines discriminating against fewer than 20% of our studied exit relays. In comparison, 30% of social networking sites, 32% of shopping sites, and 53% of news sites discriminate against fewer than 20% of our studied exit relays. Social networking and online shopping sites share similar blocking behavior, with 50% of them blocking over 60% of the chosen relays. **Figure 11** illustrates these results.

### The Evolution of Tor Discrimination

We focused on changes in discrimination over time by conducting four crawls via our own ten exit relays to the Alexa Top 500 websites. Let Day 0 denote the day when we set the relay’s exit flag. Crawls were conducted on Day -1, Day 0, and once a week thereafter. **Table 7** shows the fraction of websites found to discriminate against each exit set during each crawl. We observed increases in discrimination when the exit flag is assigned, which can be attributed to our improved crawling methodology deployed on Day 0 (the Day -1 crawl utilized the crawler from Khattak et al.; see below). The high amount of discrimination observed on our Day-0 crawl for all exit relays indicates proactive discrimination against Tor exit relays. Our results do not indicate differences due to relay category in the amount of discrimination experienced.

### Measurement Methodology

We measured the impact of changes in our discrimination identification methodology compared to previous work by Khattak et al. [2]. The key differences are:
1. Khattak et al. limited their measurements to identifying front-page discrimination, whereas our crawler also tests search and login interactions.
2. Khattak et al. used the difference in HTTP status codes returned by control and test nodes, which can underestimate discrimination due to the inability to detect block pages that return an HTTP 200 OK status code. Our method relies on screenshot differences and HTTP status codes as signals for discrimination.
3. Khattak et al. used the Python urllib2 library to send HTTP requests for front pages, which can be easily identified as irregular user activity. In contrast, we perform complete page loads, including third-party content and JavaScript execution.

**Figure 12** confirms that previous work underestimates the amount of discrimination.

### Privacy-Sensitive Exit Logging

To understand the discrimination experienced by actual Tor users, we performed privacy-sensitive logging on our deployed exit relays. This observational dataset, based on real Tor-user web traffic distributions and user interactions, provides a picture of the discrimination actually encountered by users.

#### Logging Approach

We developed a custom logger to measure the number of failed TLS handshakes and HTTP requests. Our approach, designed after consultation with the Tor developer community, takes precautions to avoid de-anonymization of users. We use bucketing to split the Alexa Top 1M websites into exponentially growing sets based on their Alexa ranks. Event counters are maintained in memory and written to disk only once a day, rounded up to the nearest multiple of eight before writing to disk to increase anonymity-set sizes.

#### Results

**Table 8** shows the percentage of failed HTTP requests and incomplete HTTPS handshakes encountered by users of our exit relays. We find that the fraction of incomplete handshakes steadily increases over time. The steep increase in HTTP error codes during weeks four and five is attributed to our relays being (ab)used in a scraping attempt on a popular website. Besides this sudden increase, the fraction of HTTP errors accords with data observed through our crawls, but the fraction of incomplete HTTPS handshakes runs higher, likely due to natural occurrences.

### Discussion and Future Work

Our studies have limitations, some resulting from our desire to protect the privacy of Tor users, and others from the limited datasets available. Our crawls, while more in-depth than prior efforts, were too time-consuming to run often enough to gain statistical guarantees about discrimination by any one website. Nevertheless, they show that discrimination is common and sometimes subtle.

The large amounts of blocking and discrimination identified by our crawling and privacy-sensitive measurements suggest that Tor’s utility is threatened by online service providers opting to stifle Tor users’ access to their services. Some blacklists proactively add Tor exit IP addresses, highlighting that Tor users fate-share with all Tor users—present and past. Other blacklisting appears to be reactive, suggesting that blocking may decrease if Tor can reduce the amount of abuse it emits.
