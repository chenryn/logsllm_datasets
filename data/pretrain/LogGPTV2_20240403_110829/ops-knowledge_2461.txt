User: How to configure routers and switches to implement VLAN-based network segmentation?
Assistant: 1. Determine the VLAN division scheme, assign different network devices, hosts, and servers to different VLANs; 2. Create VLANs on the router, and assign a unique VLAN ID to each VLAN; 3. Enable it on the switch VLAN function, and divide the corresponding ports into different VLANs; 4. Set the port connecting the router and the switch to Trunk mode, so that the router can identify and process different VLAN data transmitted from the switch; 5. Configure each Parameters such as the IP address and gateway of each VLAN, as well as the interface and routing rules with the external network; 6. Configure the basic information such as the name and ID of each VLAN in the switch, and the binding relationship with the port. After completing the above steps, VLAN-based network segmentation can be realized. Different VLANs can communicate with each other, but they cannot directly access devices in other VLANs. At the same time, through the routing rules of the router, the data flow and access rights between different VLANs can be controlled.
