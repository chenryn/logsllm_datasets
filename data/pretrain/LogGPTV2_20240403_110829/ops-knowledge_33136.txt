User: How to use the SSH protocol to realize remote login and file transfer? Please describe the steps in detail.
Assistant: SSH (Secure Shell) is an encrypted network protocol for remotely controlling computers and transferring files. It can guarantee the security in the communication process, making sensitive information not easy to be stolen. The following will describe in detail the operation steps of using the SSH protocol to realize remote login and file transfer. Remote login: 1. First install the SSH client (such as PuTTY) on the local computer and the IP address and port number of the remote server that needs to be logged in remotely. 2. Open the SSH client, enter the IP address and port number of the remote server, and click the "Open" button. 3. In the login interface, enter the user name and password of the remote server for authentication. Note that the system will hide the password you enter and will not display it. 4. After entering the correct user name and password, you can successfully log in to the remote server. At this time, you can execute remote commands in the SSH client, or use a graphical interface to operate. File transfer: 1. Install the SSH client and SCP tool on the local computer. 2. Open the command line window or terminal, enter the SCP command, and specify the path of the local file to be transferred and the target path of the remote server. 3. Enter the correct user name and password, and the system will automatically establish an encrypted tunnel between the local and remote servers to ensure the security of the file transfer process. 4. After the command is executed, you can see the successfully transferred file on the remote server. It should be noted that in order to ensure the security of SSH protocol communication, it is necessary to configure the SSH service on the Linux server and open the SSH port (usually the default port is 22), and ensure that the user name and password have sufficient strength and randomness to avoid being The attacker cracks. At the same time, the SSH connection should be closed after each operation to prevent the attacker from using the unclosed SSH connection to attack.
