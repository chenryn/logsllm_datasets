The Right to Be Forgotten
More Than a Pandora’s Box?

Abstract:  
Recently,  political  voices  have 
stressed the need to introduce a right to be forgot-
ten as new human right. Individuals should have the 
right to make potentially damaging information dis-
appear  after  a  certain  time  has  elapsed.  Such  new 
right, however, can come in conflict with the princi-
ple of free speech. Therefore, its scope needs to be 
evaluated in the light of appropriate data protection 
rules.  Insofar,  a  more  user-centered  approach  is  to 
be realized. “Delete” can not be a value as such, but 
must be balanced within a new legal framework.

A. Introduction
1	
In 2010 a first legislative project was developed in 
France that envisaged the creation of a “right to be 
forgotten” online.1 Subsequently, not much concrete 
information was made available about the proposed 
law, which was intended to force online and mobile 
firms to dispose of e-mails and text messages after 
an agreed-upon length of time or at the request of 
the individual concerned. In November 2010, the EU 
Commission took up the idea of introducing a right 
to be forgotten in the context of the ongoing revision 
of the Data Protection Directive 95/46;2 the outcome 
of the vague proposal is still uncertain. 
2	 The right to be forgotten in the context of digital 
memory and/or data retention was only recently 
proposed as a fundamental right; however, its in-
herent background concept has been a discussion 
topic in Continental Europe and in the United States 
for many years. The main example in court prac-
tice and legal doctrine concerned persons who were 
convicted in court and who wanted to make this in-
formation disappear after a certain time period had 
elapsed.3 In the United States, the lists of sexual of-
fenders living in the neighborhood that are partly 
published on the Internet are topics of debate. A 
specific “case” is described in Mayer-Schönberg-
er’s book Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital 
Age.4 Stacy Snyder, a 25-year-old former education 
student at Millersville University School of Educa-
tion in Pennsylvania, was confronted with a pro-
fessor who became aware of a picture of her from 
a party posted on her MySpace web page, showing 
her drinking from a plastic cup and wearing a pi-
rate’s hat (captioned “drunken pirate”). The profes-
sor informed the school authorities dealing with Sta-
cy’s file, who thereupon refused to grant the young 
woman the diploma she had earned, stating that her 
conduct was “unprofessional” and that she had, al-
beit indirectly, encouraged young people to drink. 
Stacy’s attempt to reverse the decision in court on 
the basis of her right of free speech failed.5
3	 As mentioned, the term “right to be forgotten” has 
only recently been created. A decade ago, however, 
a similar term, namely the “right to forget,” was al-
ready a topic of debate.6 But viewed precisely, the 
active and the passive side of the “forget” medal are 
not identical, and the right to be forgotten should not 
be confused with the right to forget as happens fre-
quently in blog discussions:7 The “right to forget” 
refers to the already intensively reflected situation 
that a historical event should no longer be revital-

ized due to the length of time elapsed since its occur-
rence; the “right to be forgotten” reflects the claim 
of an individual to have certain data deleted so that 
third persons can no longer trace them.8 Therefore, 
the right to be forgotten is based on the autonomy 
of an individual becoming a rightholder in respect of 
personal information on a time scale; the longer the 
origin of the information goes back, the more likely 
personal interests prevail over public interests. 
4	 This contribution looks at the direct and indirect tra-
ces that lead from the general personality right to a 
specific right to be forgotten, it analyzes some key 
data protection concepts in light of the actual im-
plementation of such a new and fundamental right, 
and finally it takes possible legal and technological 
limits of this proposed right into account. 
B. Substance of the Right 
to Be Forgotten
I.  Basis in the Right of 
the Personality
1.  Continental Europe
5	
In Continental Europe, the right to be forgotten can 
be considered as being contained in the right of the 
personality, encompassing several elements such as 
dignity, honor, and the right to private life. Manifold 
terminologies are used in the context of the right 
of personality – mainly the right for the (moral and 
legal) integrity of a person not to be infringed and 
for a sphere of privacy to be maintained and distin-
guished. The (privacy) right to indeed keep certain 
things secret has already been arguably extended 
to the right of Internet users not to make their ac-
tivity trails available to third persons.9 Essentially, 
rightholders are relying on their own autonomy to 
individually decide on the possible use of their own 
data.10
6	
In most Continental European countries, there is 
wide court practice available delineating the extent 
to which (Internet) media have a right of their own 
to reveal information about a specific person, who 
in turn may claim the right to enjoy the protection 
of private life (privacy).11
7	 Switzerland is a good example for the development 
of the right to be forgotten. After a first ground-
breaking decision forbidding an artist to present a 
painting of the famous late Swiss painter Hodler in 
an art gallery,12 courts have mainly dealt with situ-
ations in which a convicted person wanted to avoid 
information about earlier criminal records (of an of-
ficial or unofficial nature) being drawn to public at-
tention:13 Since criminals do not remain of interest 
to the public indefinitely, the public should not have 
access to the respective records after a certain time 
period.14 Insofar, court practice acknowledges an in-
dividual’s right to be forgotten as a criminal.15 For 
the courts, the discretion in interpreting the term 
“substantial amount of time” that has passed since 
the occurrence of criminal activity, therefore remov-
ing the interest of the public in being reminded of 
these events, is rather broad; obviously the evalua-
tion depends upon the circumstances, such as which 
information is no longer of public interest and pos-
sibly counterproductive to the goal of rehabilitat-
ing the person in question.16 Consequently, privacy 
concerns might preclude the media from revealing 
certain truths and previously publicized facts if the 
information is no longer newsworthy, but when the 
information about the past is still needed to protect 
the public in present times, a right to be forgotten 
cannot be invoked.17
8	 Similar discussions are also being held in other Con-
tinental European countries. In Germany, for exam-
ple, following the famous Lebach decision of the Con-
stitutional Court,18 several court proceedings have 
taken place in view of a possible interpretation of the 
right to be forgotten;19 court practice has thereby ap-
plied a differentiated approach, evaluating the cir-
cumstances of the case (push or pull service, im-
portance of criminal activity, etc.). Apart from the 
question how relevant criminal records should be af-
ter the expiration of a certain time period, aspects 
of involvement in political movements (for exam-
ple, during World War II or as a member of the rul-
ing party in the former German Democratic Repub-
lic) are also debated issues. Furthermore, the Spanish 
Data Protection Authority (EAPD) recently accused 
Google of invading the personal privacy of users, ar-
guing that the company was in breach of the right to 
be forgotten as acknowledged in the laws of Spain.20
9	 During the last decades, national court practice has 
been condensed and further developed in the judg-
ments of the Human Rights Court in Strasbourg 
based on the European Convention on Human Rights 
(hereinafter ECHR).21 The Human Rights Court in 
Strasbourg has rendered many decisions by apply-
ing a balance-of-interests test between the funda-
mental right to privacy (Art. 8 ECHR) and the free-
dom of speech (Art. 10 ECHR); however, the right to 
be forgotten has not yet been specifically addressed. 
In the case of Caroline von Hannover, who (unsuc-
cessfully in Germany) initiated legal actions against 
photographers who took pictures from her daily life 
involving activities of a purely private nature, the 
Human Rights Court at least expressed the opinion 
in the field of traditional media that the information 
distribution should be limited by the interest of the 
concerned person not to make public very personal 
or even intimate information, and that the state

would be obliged to protect this interest.22 Closer to 
the “forgetting” topic, the Human Rights Court re-
cently clarified the relation of the freedom of media 
vis à vis the rights of privacy in a specific case (relat-
ing to Norway) in which a person with a criminal re-
cord invoked the presumption of innocence and the 
“right to be forgotten.” The Court concluded that the 
publication had gravely damaged the person’s repu-
tation and honor and had been especially harmful to 
the person’s moral and psychological integrity; the 
reasoning was based on privacy considerations in 
general, not on the right to be forgotten.23
2.  United States 
10	 In Anglo-American court practice, particularly in the 
United States, the right of free speech according to 
the First Amendment has been applied in favor of the 
dissemination of truthful information relevant to the 
public interest about convicted persons.24 Since the 
First Amendment to the US Constitution plays a par-
ticularly important role in court practice and seems 
to have reached a prevailing level as an entrenched 
right in comparison with other fundamental rights,25 
US courts rather tend to the statement that restric-
tions to the right of free speech would “invite timid-
ity and self-censorship and very likely lead to the 
suppression of many items that would otherwise be 
published and that should be available to the pub-
lic.”26 For decades, court practice defined the poten-
tial scope of a right to be forgotten in quite a narrow 
way since the justification for limiting the freedom 
of speech was tied to the constitutional scrutiny of 
“highest order” of public confidentiality interest, 
making it very difficult to satisfy this standard.27
11	 Theoretically, disclosure could also constitute a tort 
according to the Second Restatement of Torts;28 how-
ever, the Supreme Court did overturn a decision of 
a Florida court granting compensatory and punitive 
damages to a victim of disclosure.29 Legal doctrine 
has shed light on the “public significance test” as 
developed by the Supreme Court and applied under 
the Restatement’s public disclosure tort; however, 
the interests-balancing test between the right of a 
democratic society to be informed and the claim of 
an individual to have a right to be forgotten is usu-
ally interpreted in the favor of society and civic val-
ues.30 The privacy right seems to prevail only if sen-
sitive information is disclosed after interventions 
into the private sphere have been done in frivolous 
and socially irredeemable forays.31
12	 This restrictive approach also seems to be the reason 
why the case of Andrew Feldmar, who had a criminal 
record because of violating anti-drug laws by taking 
LSD in his younger years, is discussed at length by 
Mayer-Schönberger from a US perspective under a 
data retention angle;32 if this case had happened in 
Continental Europe, the appreciation would “natu-
rally” have been done under the aspects of person-
ality rights as described above (and would probably 
not have caused any specific problems related to the 
digital memory of the Internet). 
II.  Limits of the Right to Be Forgotten 
13	 The EU approach mentioned above (similarly to the 
earlier French approach) would introduce a right to 
be forgotten that would allow an individual to have 
his or her data deleted. However, the proposal so far 
does not clearly explain how this right could actu-
ally be enforced or how the deletion could be done 
in practice. Various problems in this context must 
be taken into account:
14	 Privacy or a right to keep personal information con-
fidential can be in conflict with other rights, such as 
free speech, and other privileges related to the free 
use of the web. Obviously, as already outlined, there 
is a court practice that balances the interests of pri-
vacy advocates against the freedom-of-speech de-
fenders, and trade-offs are also needed in the real 
world.33 Nevertheless, in the context of Internet 
communications, legal doctrine clearly refers to the 
fact that protection of the right to privacy is so dif-
ficult since it would mean “a right to have the gov-
ernment stop you from speaking about me.”34 Fur-
thermore, this traditional concept is increasingly 
confronted with the fact that social networks such as 
Facebook are assuming an information-transporting 
function that might extend the implied consent of 
the person concerned (like Stacy Snyder) to upload 
a photo. In addition, the question remains whether 
the right to be forgotten is actually a “privacy” right 
since privacy concerns information that is not pub-
licly known. In contrast, the right to be forgotten 
would turn public information into private infor-
mation at a certain time by no longer allowing third 
persons to access such information.35
15	 A further (practical) obstacle consists in the fact that 
Internet users consider censorship damaging and go 
to lengths to circumvent it. As recent experiences 
with the attempt of many governments to block ac-
cess to the Internet have shown,36 interested persons 
generally find a way to communicate electronically. 
With improved technology, it is becoming increas-
ingly difficult for governments and private persons 
to contain certain information.
16	 Finally, a cultural aspect must be taken into account:
