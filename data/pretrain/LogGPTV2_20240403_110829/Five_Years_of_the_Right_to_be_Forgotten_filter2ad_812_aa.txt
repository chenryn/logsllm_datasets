### The Right to Be Forgotten: More Than a Pandora’s Box?

**By Rolf H. Weber, Dr.; Chair Professor for International Business Law at the University of Zurich and Visiting Professor at the University of Hong Kong**

#### Abstract:
Recently, political voices have emphasized the need to introduce the right to be forgotten as a new human right. This right would allow individuals to make potentially damaging information disappear after a certain period. However, such a right can conflict with the principle of free speech. Therefore, its scope must be evaluated in light of appropriate data protection rules. A more user-centered approach is necessary, where "delete" cannot be an absolute value but must be balanced within a new legal framework.

### A. Introduction

In 2010, France initiated a legislative project to create a "right to be forgotten" online. Although specific details were limited, the proposed law aimed to require online and mobile firms to delete emails and text messages after a specified period or upon request. In November 2010, the EU Commission considered introducing this right during the revision of the Data Protection Directive 95/46, but the outcome remains uncertain.

The concept of the right to be forgotten in the context of digital memory and data retention has been discussed in Continental Europe and the United States for many years. Notable examples include court cases where convicted individuals sought to remove their criminal records from public view. In the U.S., the publication of lists of sexual offenders on the Internet has also sparked debate. A specific case is described in Viktor Mayer-Schönberger's book, *Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age*, involving Stacy Snyder, a former education student whose diploma was withheld due to unprofessional conduct documented on her MySpace page.

The term "right to be forgotten" is relatively new, but a similar concept, the "right to forget," has been debated for over a decade. The "right to forget" refers to the idea that historical events should no longer be revived after a significant period, while the "right to be forgotten" involves an individual's claim to have certain data deleted so that third parties can no longer access it. This right is based on the autonomy of the individual, with personal interests prevailing over public interests as time passes.

This paper examines the evolution of the right to be forgotten from the general personality right, analyzes key data protection concepts, and considers the legal and technological limits of this proposed right.

### B. Substance of the Right to Be Forgotten

#### I. Basis in the Right of Personality

##### 1. Continental Europe

In Continental Europe, the right to be forgotten is often seen as an extension of the right to personality, which includes dignity, honor, and the right to private life. Various terminologies are used, but the core concept is the protection of an individual's moral and legal integrity and the maintenance of a private sphere. This right has been extended to include the right of internet users to keep their activity trails confidential. Essentially, individuals rely on their autonomy to decide how their data is used.

In most Continental European countries, there is extensive court practice defining the extent to which media can reveal information about a person, who in turn may claim the right to privacy. Switzerland, for example, has a well-developed jurisprudence on the right to be forgotten, particularly in cases where convicted individuals seek to remove information about their criminal records. Courts generally acknowledge that criminals do not remain of public interest indefinitely and should have the right to have their records removed after a certain period. The discretion in determining when this period ends is broad and depends on the circumstances, such as the nature of the information and the goal of rehabilitation.

Similar discussions occur in other Continental European countries. In Germany, the Constitutional Court's Lebach decision has led to several court proceedings on the right to be forgotten, with a differentiated approach evaluating the specifics of each case. In Spain, the Data Protection Authority (EAPD) recently accused Google of violating the right to be forgotten, arguing that the company was breaching Spanish laws.

The Human Rights Court in Strasbourg has issued numerous decisions balancing the fundamental right to privacy (Article 8 ECHR) and the freedom of speech (Article 10 ECHR), though it has not specifically addressed the right to be forgotten. In the case of Caroline von Hannover, the Court expressed the opinion that the distribution of very personal information should be limited by the individual's interest in privacy. In another case, the Court ruled that the publication of a person's criminal record had gravely damaged their reputation and honor, based on general privacy considerations.

##### 2. United States

In the United States, the First Amendment's protection of free speech has been a significant factor in court decisions. US courts tend to favor the dissemination of truthful information relevant to the public interest, even if it concerns convicted individuals. The First Amendment's importance in court practice makes it difficult to restrict free speech, as such restrictions could lead to self-censorship and suppression of important information.

Theoretically, disclosure of private information could be considered a tort under the Second Restatement of Torts, but the Supreme Court has overturned decisions granting damages for such disclosures. Legal doctrine generally balances the public's right to be informed against an individual's right to be forgotten, typically favoring the former unless the information is sensitive and obtained through frivolous means.

The restrictive approach in the US is evident in the case of Andrew Feldmar, who had a criminal record for taking LSD in his youth. If this case had occurred in Continental Europe, it would likely have been evaluated under the right to personality and might not have raised significant issues related to digital memory.

#### II. Limits of the Right to Be Forgotten

The EU's approach, similar to the earlier French proposal, would allow individuals to have their data deleted. However, the proposal does not clearly explain how this right could be enforced or how deletion could be implemented. Several challenges must be addressed:

- **Conflicts with Free Speech:** Privacy rights can conflict with free speech and other web-related privileges. Legal doctrine recognizes the difficulty in protecting privacy, as it often requires limiting the ability of others to speak about an individual. Additionally, social networks like Facebook complicate the issue by extending the implied consent of users to share information.
- **Practical Obstacles:** Internet users generally oppose censorship and find ways to circumvent it. Recent attempts by governments to block internet access have shown that interested parties can still communicate electronically. Technological advancements make it increasingly difficult to contain certain information.
- **Cultural Aspects:** Cultural differences also play a role. In some societies, the right to be forgotten may be more readily accepted, while in others, the emphasis on transparency and accountability may make it less palatable.
