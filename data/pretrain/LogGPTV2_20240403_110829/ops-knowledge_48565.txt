User: I am trying to start a background job in elastic beanstalk, the background job has an infinite loop so it never returns a response and so I receive this error:" Some instances have not responded to commands.Responses were not received from [i-ba5fb2f7]."
I am starting the background job in the elastic beanstalk .config file like this:
  06_start_workers:
    command: "./workers.py &"
Is there any way to do this? I don't want elastic beanstalk to wait for a return value of that process ..
Assistant: fixed it, just needed to write this command instead:  

command: "nohup ./workers.py > foo.out 2> foo.err < /dev/null &"
