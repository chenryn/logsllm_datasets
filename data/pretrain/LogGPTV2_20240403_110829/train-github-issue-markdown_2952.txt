When you are building components, you often want to support both valueLink and
value/onChange, which means you need a function like this:
    getValueLink: function(props) {
      return props.valueLink || {
        value: props.value,
        requestChange: props.onChange
      };
    },
This easily end up being duplicated between components. Would it be an idea to
include it in the LinkedState mixin?
