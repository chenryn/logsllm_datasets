Visualization tools: Tableau, Echarts, etc.\n\nAssistant: Based on the above requirements and data technology options, we can design a big data analysis platform with the following characteristics: 1. Architecture design: adopt microservice architecture, distribute data flow through message queue, realize real-time processing, support high throughput and low Delay. Among them, the Spark-based stream processing engine can quickly process data streams and provide powerful data computing and processing capabilities. 2. Data storage: HDFS is used as the main data storage medium, which can efficiently store and manage large amounts of data. At the same time, distributed databases such as Cassandra and HBase are used to meet the needs of multi-dimensional data storage and fast query. 3. Data mining and machine learning: In terms of data mining and machine learning, combine Scikit-learn, TensorFlow and other libraries to realize data analysis, prediction, classification and other functions, and use natural language processing technology to perform text analysis and semantic understanding. 4. Distributed deployment and horizontal expansion: The platform independently deploys each microservice through containerization technology, and realizes distributed deployment and horizontal expansion through Kubernetes and other management tools to improve the stability and scalability of the system. 5. Visualization tools: In terms of visualization, tools such as Tableau and Echarts are used to display the analysis results in charts to help users better understand the data. The platform is characterized by efficient, controllable and scalable data processing and storage through distributed computing framework and data storage technology. In terms of data mining and machine learning, advanced algorithms and technologies are used to realize diversified data analysis and processing. At the same time, through visualization tools, the interpretability of analysis results is improved, helping users better understand data and supporting data-driven decision-making.
