Question: You are analyzing a web application for security vulnerabilities and come across a feature that allows users to post content to a public forum. You suspect that this feature could be exploited to perform an incubated attack. Considering the nature of incubated vulnerabilities, which two factors would you prioritize in your assessment to determine the potential for such an attack to be successful?
"A": "Ensuring that the forum's content posting feature sanitizes user input to prevent stored injections.",
"B": "Confirming that the application has a recall mechanism that retrieves and displays user-generated content.",
"C": "Verifying that the server hosting the application is configured to deny installation of new Java packages.",
