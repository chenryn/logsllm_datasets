User: I am about to start a personal project using python and I will be using it on both Linux(Fedora) and Windows(Vista), Although I might as well make it work on a mac while im at it. I have found an API for the GUI that will work on all 3. The reason I am asking is because I have always heard of small differences that are easily avoided if you know about them before starting. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions that fall along these lines?
Assistant: You should take care of the Python version you are developing against. Especially, on a Mac, the default version of Python installed with the OS, is rather old (of course, newer versions can be installed)
Don't use the OS specific libraries
Take special care of 'special' UI elements, like taskbar icons (windows), ...
Use forward slashes when using paths, avoid C:/, /home/..., ... Use os.path to work with paths.
