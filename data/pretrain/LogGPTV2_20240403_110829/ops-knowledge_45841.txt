I am about to start a personal project using Python, and I plan to develop it on both Linux (Fedora) and Windows (Vista). Additionally, I would like to ensure that the project is also compatible with macOS. I have already identified a cross-platform GUI API that should work across all three operating systems. However, I am aware that there can be subtle differences between these platforms, which, if known in advance, can be easily managed. 

Could anyone provide tips or suggestions to help me navigate these potential issues?

When developing a cross-platform Python application, here are some key considerations:

1. **Python Version**: Be mindful of the Python version you are developing against. On macOS, for instance, the default version of Python installed with the OS may be quite outdated. It is advisable to install a more recent version of Python, such as the one provided by Homebrew or the official Python website.

2. **Avoid OS-Specific Libraries**: Refrain from using libraries that are specific to a particular operating system. Instead, opt for cross-platform libraries that are designed to work seamlessly across different environments.

3. **UI Elements**: Pay special attention to 'special' UI elements that may differ between operating systems. For example, taskbar icons on Windows, dock icons on macOS, and panel icons on Linux. Ensure that your GUI is consistent and functional across all platforms.

4. **File Paths**: Use forward slashes (`/`) for file paths instead of backslashes (`\`), which are specific to Windows. To handle file paths in a cross-platform manner, use the `os.path` module. This will help you avoid issues related to path separators and other platform-specific conventions.

By following these guidelines, you can minimize the differences and ensure a smoother development process across Linux, Windows, and macOS.
