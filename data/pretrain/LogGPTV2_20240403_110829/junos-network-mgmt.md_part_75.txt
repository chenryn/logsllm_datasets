**Monitor Interfaces:**

**Purpose:**
View general information about all physical and logical interfaces for a device.

**Action:**
Enter the following show commands in the CLI to view interface status and traffic statistics:
- `show interfaces terse`
- `show interfaces extensive`
- `show interfaces interface-name`

**Note:**
On SRX Series Firewalls, configuring identical IPs on a single interface will not generate a warning message; instead, a syslog message will be generated.

**J-Web User Interface:**
- **Port:** Indicates the interface name.
- **Admin Status:** Indicates whether the interface is enabled (Up) or disabled (Down).
- **Link Status:** Indicates whether the interface is linked (Up) or not linked (Down).
- **Address:** Indicates the IP address of the interface.
- **Zone:** Indicates whether the zone is an untrust zone or a trust zone.
- **Services:** Indicates services that are enabled on the device, such as HTTP and SSH.
- **Protocols:** Indicates protocols that are enabled on the device, such as BGP and IGMP.
- **Input Rate Graph:** Displays interface bandwidth utilization in bytes per second.
- **Output Rate Graph:** Displays interface bandwidth utilization in bytes per second.
- **Error Counters Chart:** Displays input and output error counters in the form of a bar chart.
- **Packet Counters Chart:** Displays the number of broadcast, unicast, and multicast packet counters in the form of a pie chart. (Supported only for interfaces with MAC statistics.)

**Options to Change Interface Display:**
- **Port for FPC:** Controls the member for which information is displayed.
- **Start/Stop Button:** Starts or stops monitoring the selected interfaces.
- **Show Graph:** Displays input and output packet counters and error counters in the form of charts.
- **Pop-up Button:** Displays the interface graphs in a separate pop-up window.
- **Details:** Displays extensive statistics about the selected interface, including its general status, traffic information, IP address, I/O errors, class-of-service data, and statistics.
- **Refresh Interval:** Indicates the duration after which the data on the page is refreshed.
- **Clear Statistics:** Clears the statistics for the selected interface.

#### PPP Monitoring

**Purpose:**
Display PPP monitoring information, including PPP address pool information, session status for PPP interfaces, cumulative statistics for all PPP interfaces, and a summary of PPP sessions.

**Note:**
PPP monitoring information is available only in the CLI. The J-Web user interface does not include pages for displaying PPP monitoring information.

**Action:**
Enter the following CLI commands:
- `show ppp address-pool pool-name`
- `show ppp interface interface-name`
- `show ppp statistics`
- `show ppp summary`

#### Network Analytics

**Summary:**
This section describes the network analytics feature, which provides visibility into the performance and behavior of the data center infrastructure. It collects data from the switch, analyzes it using sophisticated algorithms, and captures the results in reports. Network administrators can use these reports to troubleshoot problems, make decisions, and adjust resources as needed.

**Topics Covered:**
- Network Analytics Overview
- Understand Network Analytics Streaming Data
- Understand Enhanced Analytics Local File Output
- Understand Network Analytics Configuration and Status
- Configure Queue and Traffic Monitoring
- Configure a Local File for Network Analytics Data
- Configure a Remote Collector for Streaming Analytics Data
- Example: Configure Queue and Traffic Statistics
- Example: Configure Queue and Traffic Monitoring

**Network Analytics Overview:**

**Enhancements in Junos OS Release 13.2X51-D15:**
- **Resources:** Consist of interfaces and system. The interfaces resource allows you to configure an interface name and an associated resource profile name for each interface. The system resource allows you to configure polling intervals for queue and traffic monitoring, and an associated resource profile for the system.
- **Resource Profile:** A template containing configurations for queue and traffic monitoring, such as depth and latency threshold values, and whether each type of monitoring is enabled or disabled. Once configured, a resource profile can be applied to a system or interfaces resource.
- **Collector:** A server for collecting queue and traffic monitoring statistics, which can be local or remote. You can configure a local server to store monitoring statistics in a log file or a remote server to receive streamed statistics data.
- **Export Profile:** Required if you wish to send streaming data to a remote collector. In the export profile, you define the category of streamed data (system-wide or interface-specific) to determine the stream type the collector will receive. You can specify both system and interface stream categories.
- **Google Protocol Buffer (GBP) Stream Format:** A new streaming format for monitoring statistics data sent to a remote collector in a single AnRecord message. The format provides nine types of information, including system information, queue and traffic status, and interface-specific data.
- **analytics.proto File:** Provides a template for the GBP stream format. This file can be used for writing your analytics server application. To download the file, visit: `/documentation/en_US/junos13.2/topics/reference/proto-files/analytics-proto.txt`
- **Use of Threshold Values:** The Analytics Manager (analyticsm) generates a queue statistics record when the lower queue depth or latency threshold value is exceeded.
- **User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** Additional transport protocol you can configure, in addition to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), for the remote streaming server port.
- **Single File for Local Logging:** Replaces the separate log files for queue and traffic statistics.
- **Change in Latency Measurement:** Configuration and reporting of latency values have changed from microseconds to nanoseconds.
- **Change in Reporting of Collection Time in UTC Format:** Statistics collection time is reported in microseconds instead of milliseconds.
- **New Operational Mode Command:** `show analytics collector` replaces the `show analytics streaming-server` command.
- **Changes in Command Output Format:** Include the addition of unicast, multicast, and broadcast packet counters in queue and traffic statistics, reversal of the sequence of statistics information in the output, and removal of traffic or queue monitoring status information from the global portion of the `show analytics configuration` and `show analytics status` command output if there is no global configuration.
