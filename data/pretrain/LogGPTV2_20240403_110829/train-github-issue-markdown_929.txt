Subject: Clarification on Symfony Annotation Error

Hello,

I would like to bring attention to an error that may be confusing for some developers. When you do not include the correct namespace in a controller using annotations, such as:

```php
use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Method;
```

and then use the `@Method` annotation, for example:

```php
/**
 * @Method({"GET"})
 */
```

Symfony will throw an exception with the following message:

```
Whoops, looks like something went wrong.
1/1 FileLoaderImportCircularReferenceException in FileLoader.php line 97:
...
```

This error message can be misleading and does not clearly indicate the actual issue, which is the missing `Method` namespace.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
