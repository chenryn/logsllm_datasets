Hi this is an error that for some people must be confusing, when you dont add
in a controller using annotations route the correct namespaces like:
    use Sensio\Bundle\FrameworkExtraBundle\Configuration\Method;
and then you use :
        * @Method({"GET"})
In some anotattion in a controller Symfony throw an Exception that says:
    Whoops, looks like something went wrong.
    1/1 FileLoaderImportCircularReferenceException in FileLoader.php line 97:
    ...
witch is wrong and confusing, thanks
