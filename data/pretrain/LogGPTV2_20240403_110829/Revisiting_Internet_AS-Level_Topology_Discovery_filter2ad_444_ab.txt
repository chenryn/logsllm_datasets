### Figure 7: Ratio of Links in GBT D to G12

Figure 7 shows the contour plot of the ratio of the number of links in GBT D over the number of links in G12, connecting Autonomous Systems (ASs) of corresponding degrees. The dark region between 0.5 and 1.5 on the x and y axes indicates that BGP updates contain additional links compared to BTDs, particularly between low and medium-degree ASs near the periphery of the graph.

### Link Betweenness in AS-Links

In the context of a graph \( G(V, E) \), the betweenness \( B(e) \) of a link \( e \in E \) is defined as:

\[
B(e) = \sum_{i, j \in V} \frac{\sigma_{ij}(e)}{\sigma_{ij}},
\]

where \( \sigma_{ij}(e) \) is the number of shortest paths between nodes \( i \) and \( j \) that pass through link \( e \), and \( \sigma_{ij} \) is the total number of shortest paths between \( i \) and \( j \). This definition implies that link betweenness is proportional to the traffic load on a given link, assuming uniform traffic distribution and shortest-path routing.

### Figure 8: Betweenness Distribution

Figure 8 illustrates the betweenness distribution of G12 and GBT D, revealing that our updates-constructed graph has more links with small betweenness. Links with small betweenness have lower communication importance in a graph-theoretic context, indicating that our methodology uncovers backup links and links used for local communication in the periphery of the graph.

### Topological Analysis Summary

Overall, our topological analysis demonstrates that the augmented graph remains a power-law network and includes more links between low and medium-degree nodes. This finding suggests that our method effectively identifies links of lower communication importance, which are likely used for backup and local communication purposes in the periphery of the Internet.

### Conclusions

In this work, we leverage previously untapped topological information from a well-known and easily accessible source of interdomain routing data. We show that the Internet topology is significantly larger than commonly derived BTD topologies and demonstrate how an undesirable aspect of the interdomain architecture can be constructively utilized. Our findings indicate that the substantially larger AS-graph retains the power-law property of the degree distribution. Additionally, our method discovers links of small communication importance, suggesting their use for backup and local communication in the periphery of the Internet.

We emphasize that this work highlights a significant gap in our understanding of the Internet topology. Therefore, we stress the need for more focused efforts on measuring the Internet topology before drawing far-reaching conclusions based on currently available, yet incomplete, AS-level topology data.

### Appendix: Detection of Session Resets

The problem of detecting BGP session resets has been addressed by others. For example, Maennel et al. [25] propose a heuristic to detect session resets on AS-links by monitoring BGP updates in RV. Our focus is on a less demanding task: detecting session resets with immediate neighbors of RV. Our algorithm consists of two components. The first detects surges in BGP updates from the same peer over a short time window of \( s \) seconds. If the number of unique prefixes updated in \( s \) exceeds a significant percentage \( p \) of the previously known unique prefixes from the same peer, a session reset is inferred. The second component detects periods of significant inactivity when a threshold \( t \) is passed from otherwise active peers. Combining both approaches with low thresholds (\( t = 4 \) minutes, \( p = 80\% \), \( s = 4 \) seconds) results in an aggressive session reset detection algorithm. We calculate NP and NL over a month with and without aggressive session reset detection enabled, finding that the calculated statistics are virtually the same, with less than 0.1% variation. This implies that the short time scale of session resets does not affect the span of the NP and NL statistics. Therefore, we exclude session reset detection in the remaining NP and NL measurements.
