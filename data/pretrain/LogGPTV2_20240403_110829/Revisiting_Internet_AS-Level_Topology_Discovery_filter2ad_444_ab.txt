Figure 7 depicts the contourplot of the ratio of the number of links in GBT D
over the number of links in G12 connecting ASs of corresponding degrees. The
dark region between 0.5 and 1.5 exponents on the x and y axes, signiﬁes the
fact that BGP updates contain additional links, compared to BTDs, between
low and medium-degree ASs close to the periphery of the graph.

where σij(e) is the number of shortest paths between nodes i and j going through
link e and σij is the total number of shortest paths between i and j. With this
deﬁnition, link betweenness is proportional to the traﬃc load on a given link
under the assumptions of uniform traﬃc distribution and shortest–path routing.
Figure 8 illustrates the betweenness distribution of G12 and of GBT D
and reveals
that our updates–constructed graph yields more links with small betweenness.
Links with small betweenness have lower communication importance in a graph
theoretic context, demonstrating that our methodology unveils backup links and
links used for local communication in the periphery of the graph.

Overall, our topological analysis shows that our augmented graph remains a
power-law network and has more links between low and medium–degree nodes

5 Conclusions
In this work we exploit the previously unharnessed topological information that
can be extracted from the most well–known and easily accessible source of Inter-
net interdomain routing data. We evidence that the Internet topology is vastly
larger than the common BTD–derived topologies and we show how an unde-
sired aspect of the interdomain architecture can be used constructively. We ﬁnd
that our substantially larger AS–graph retains the power–law property of the
degree distribution. Finally, we show that our method discovers links of small
communication importance connecting low and medium–degree ASs, suggesting
AS–links used for backup purposes and local communication in the periphery of
the Internet.
Closing, we highlight that our work is a step forward showing a large gap
in our knowledge of the Internet topology. For this reason, we pronounce the
need to focus more on the perpetual problem of measuring Internet topology
before accepting far–reaching conclusions based on currently available AS–level
topology data, which are undeniable rich but substantially incomplete.

Detection of Session Resets
The problem of detection of BGP session resets has also been addressed by
others. In [25] Maennel et al. propose a heuristic to detect session resets on AS–
links in arbitrary Internet locations by monitoring BGP updates in RV. We are
concerned with a seemingly less demanding task: detection of session resets with
immediate neighbors of RV. Our algorithm is composed of two components. The
ﬁrst detects surges in the BGP updates received from the same peer over a short
time window of s seconds. If the number of unique preﬁxes updated in s are
more than a signiﬁcant percent p of the previously known unique preﬁxes from
the same peer, then a session reset is inferred. The second component detects
periods of signiﬁcant inactivity when a threshold t is passed from otherwise
active peers. We combine both approaches and set low thresholds (t = 4mins,
p = 80%, s = 4secs) to yield an aggressive session reset detection algorithm.
Then, we calculate NP and NL over a period of a month with and without
aggressive session reset detection enabled. We ﬁnd that the calculated statistics
are virtually the same with less then 0.1% variation. Implying that the short
time scale of the lifetime of session resets does not aﬀect the span of the NP and
NL statistics. Hence, we leave out the detection of session resets in the remaining
NP and NL measurements.
