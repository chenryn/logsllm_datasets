User: Please introduce some common web application attack methods (such as SQL injection, XXE, CSRF), and provide some defense measures and best practices.
Assistant: 1. SQL injection (SQL Injection) Attack method: The attacker injects SQL code into the input box to bypass authentication and obtain or modify data in the database. Defensive measures: use parameterized queries, limit user permissions, filter malicious input, implement strict access control to the database, use security authentication, etc. 2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack method: The attacker injects a malicious script on a website, and when the user visits the website, the script will run in the victim's browser. Defensive measures: filter and escape user input, enable XSS protection of the browser, set Content-Security-Policy (CSP) in the HTTP header, and perform security assessment on the code. 3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack method: the attacker tricks the user into clicking a seemingly harmless link, but in fact the link is a fraudulent link. After the user logs in to his account, the attacker will send any ask. Defensive measures: Use randomized tokens for authentication, enable CORS, follow the principle of least privilege, restrict access to sensitive operations, disable third-party resources, etc. 4. XML External Entity Attack (XXE) Attack method: Attackers take advantage of the vulnerabilities of XML processors (parsers) to decisively affect the processing of XML data in the attacked system by constructing some specific entities in malicious XML files. Defensive measures: disable entity resolution, restrict access to external entities, filter malicious input, restrict file access, etc. 5. File upload vulnerability attack method: The attacker uses the file upload function to upload a file containing malicious code to the server, and then executes the code of the file on the server. Defensive measures: limit uploaded file type, size and quantity, verify and scan all uploaded files, store uploaded files in different file systems or databases, disable executable files on the server, etc. Best practices: use the latest software and patches, strengthen the installation and configuration of network firewalls and intrusion detection systems, organize security training and awareness education for employees, adopt secure coding practices, conduct regular vulnerability scans and penetration tests on the system, etc.
