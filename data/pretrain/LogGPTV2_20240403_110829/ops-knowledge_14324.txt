I am currently attempting to add Tesseract to my system in order to install pytesseract. I am using Windows 7 and have added the following path to my PATH environment variable:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```

However, when I run the command `tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out` or simply `tesseract` from the command line, I receive the error message: 

```
'tesseract' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

Here is a portion of my current PATH environment variable:

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;
```

Could you please provide any suggestions on what might be causing this issue? 

Thank you.

**Response:**

After adding Tesseract to your PATH, it's important to ensure that you restart your PC. In many cases, changes to the environment variables do not take effect until after a system restart. This should resolve the issue, and the `tesseract` command should then be recognized.
