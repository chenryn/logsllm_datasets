User: I am transferring a Python based development system from PC to Mac.  I need to create a virtualenv / directory to store this system.  Where is a good place to put the directory (somewhere easily accessible from a terminal window)?  I am not so savvy on the Mac as the PC, although I could probably write a bash script to change directory and activate the virtualenv.  I am running OS X Mountain Lion (v10.8) and I'm the only user on the system.
Assistant: You can have as many as you like and put them where it's convenient.  A common arrangement is to have a dedicated environment for each project; then if each project is in ~/projects/<project> you could have a virtualenv directory in each project's respective root directory.  So ~/projects/foo/.env for the virtualenv for project foo, ~/projects/bar/.env for the one for bar, etc.  (The use of .env is just a convention; again, you can name them any way you like.)
