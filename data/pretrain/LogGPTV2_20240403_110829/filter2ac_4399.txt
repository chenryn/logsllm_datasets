**ATT&CK ID:** S0483  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** IcedID

IcedID has employed web injection attacks to redirect victims to spoofed websites designed to harvest banking and other credentials. During these attacks, IcedID can use a self-signed TLS certificate in conjunction with the spoofed site. Additionally, it maintains a live connection with the legitimate site to ensure that the correct URL and certificates are displayed in the victim's browser. This technique enhances the credibility of the spoofed site, making it more difficult for users to detect the fraudulent activity.
