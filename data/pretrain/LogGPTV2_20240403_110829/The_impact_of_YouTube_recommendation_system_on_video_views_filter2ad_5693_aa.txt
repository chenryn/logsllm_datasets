## Abstract
YouTube hosts millions of videos and offers several features to help users discover content, such as video search, related video recommendations, and front-page highlights. Understanding how these features drive video views is crucial for creating strategies to boost video popularity. In this paper, we conduct a measurement study using data sets crawled from YouTube. Our findings indicate that the related video recommendation system is one of the most important sources of video views. Despite YouTube's video search being the primary source of views in aggregate, related video recommendations are the main source of views for the majority of videos. We also find a strong correlation between a video's view count and the average view count of its top referrer videos, suggesting that placement in the related video lists of popular videos can significantly increase a video's visibility. Additionally, the position of a video in a related video list plays a critical role in the click-through rate. Finally, our evaluation shows that the current recommendation system helps to increase the diversity of video views in aggregate.

## 1. Introduction
Since its establishment in early 2005, YouTube has become one of the most successful user-generated video sharing sites, with over 100 million videos. To help users find interesting content, YouTube provides features such as a search engine, front-page highlights, and related video recommendations. Understanding how these features drive video views is valuable for researchers, advertisers, and content providers. For researchers, it provides insights into content discovery in large repositories. For content providers and advertisers, it aids in strategic planning to increase video popularity and predict advertising effectiveness. Recently, YouTube has started allowing video content providers to monetize their content through ad revenue and rental fees, further emphasizing the need to understand how to drive video views.

In this paper, we perform a measurement study on data sets of hundreds of thousands of videos crawled from YouTube. We investigate how videos are discovered, the major sources driving video views, and the correlation between related video views. Our key findings include:
- The related video recommendation system is a significant source of views.
- There is a strong correlation between a video's view count and the average view count of its top referrer videos.
- The position of a video in a related video list significantly affects its click-through rate.
- The recommendation system increases the diversity of video views in aggregate.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data sets used in the study. Section 3 examines the sources of video views. Section 4 investigates the impact of the related video recommendation system on video views. Section 5 evaluates the effect of the recommendation system on the diversity of video views. Section 6 discusses related work, and Section 7 concludes the paper.

## 2. Data Description
Our study is based on data sets crawled from YouTube. This section describes the three main elements of the data and the methods used to collect them.

### 2.1 Data Source
On YouTube, a video is viewed on a "watch page," which includes valuable data about the video. We focus on three elements:
- **Video Metadata:** Basic information such as title, upload time, and total view count.
- **Related Video List:** Videos recommended by the YouTube recommendation system.
- **View Statistics & Data:** Includes the view count sequence over time, top ten view sources, and the date of the first referral and the number of views from each source (Figure 1). YouTube classifies sources into 14 categories, including YouTube Search, Related Video, and Mobile Device. The "Other/Viral" category includes all other sources. For the "Related Video" category, the referrer video is also shown.

### 2.2 Data Collection
We collected two data sets using different sampling methods to minimize bias. The trends from both data sets are consistent. For D1, we captured and parsed YouTube video requests at a university network gateway. For D2, we retrieved 400 featured videos via API, then recursively crawled their related videos and referrer videos. The collection methods and data amounts are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

| Collected Data | Metadata | Related Videos | Statistics & Data | Related Videos of Referrers |
|---------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| D1            | Y        | Y              | Y                 | N                            |
| D2            | Y        | Y              | Y                 | Y                            |

| Data Set | Start Date | Duration | # Videos with Metadata | # Videos with Related Videos | # Videos with S&D | # Referrer Videos |
|----------|------------|----------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| D1       | 28-Jan-10  | 21 days  | 498,233                | 154,363                     | 111,351           | 348,059           |
| D2       | 17-Mar-10  | 14 days  | 202,428                | 202,428                     | 55,280            | 133,114           |

## 3. Sources of Video Views
YouTube videos can be accessed through various channels, including Google search, Facebook, mobile devices, and YouTube's own features. This section investigates the main sources of video views.

### 3.1 Representativeness of Tracked Views
To ensure the representativeness of tracked views, we calculate the percentage of tracked views from the total views and the correlation between them. The average percentage of tracked views for D1 and D2 is 56.7% and 63.1%, respectively. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the percentage of tracked views (Figure 2) shows that around 70% of videos have more than 50% of their views recorded in the view statistics. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients for D1 and D2 are 0.81 and 0.84, respectively, indicating a strong linear correlation (Figure 3).

### 3.2 Main Sources of Overall Views
We examine the view statistics to determine the main sources of overall views. Figure 4 shows that YouTube Search and Related Video are the top two categories, accounting for 66.88% and 56.06% of views in D1 and D2, respectively. External sources like Google search, Facebook, and other sites account for only 7.6% and 5.6% of views. The related video recommendation system contributes about 30% of overall views, second only to YouTube Search.

### 3.3 Dominant Sources for Individual Videos
We also investigate the dominant view sources for individual videos. For each video, we identify the category contributing the largest proportion of views. Figure 5 shows that more videos are dominated by Related Video than YouTube Search. Table 3 summarizes the percentage of videos dominated by each category. The number of videos dominated by Related Video is the largest for both data sets (Figure 7).

## 4. Impact of Related Video Recommendations on Video Views
We further investigate the impact of the related video recommendation system on video views. Figure 6 shows the number of videos dominated by each type for different view count ranges. Among less popular videos, the number of Related dominated videos is the largest. For videos with view counts in the range of one thousand to one million, the number of Related dominated videos is also the largest (Figures 8 and 9).

## 5. Evaluation of View Diversity
We evaluate the impact of the recommendation system on the diversity of video views. Unlike recent results on book/CD sales, we find that YouTube's recommendation system increases the diversity of video views in aggregate. This suggests that the recommendation system helps viewers discover a wider range of videos, not just the most popular ones.

## 6. Related Work
[This section would discuss previous research on recommendation systems, video sharing platforms, and related studies.]

## 7. Conclusion
In conclusion, the related video recommendation system is a significant source of video views on YouTube. Placement in the related video lists of popular videos can significantly increase a video's visibility. The position of a video in a related video list and the correlation between a video's view count and the average view count of its top referrer videos are also important factors. Additionally, the recommendation system helps to increase the diversity of video views in aggregate. Future work could explore more detailed aspects of the recommendation algorithm and its impact on user engagement and content discovery.
