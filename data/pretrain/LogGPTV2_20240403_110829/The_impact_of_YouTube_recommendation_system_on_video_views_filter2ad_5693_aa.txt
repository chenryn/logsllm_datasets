ABSTRACT
Hosting a collection of millions of videos, YouTube oﬀers
several features to help users discover the videos of their in-
terest. For example, YouTube provides video search, related
video recommendation and front page highlight. The under-
standing of how these features drive video views is useful for
creating a strategy to drive video popularity.
In this pa-
per, we perform a measurement study on data sets crawled
from YouTube and ﬁnd that the related video recommenda-
tion, which recommends the videos that are related to the
video a user is watching, is one of the most important view
sources of videos. Despite the fact that the YouTube video
search is the number one source of views in aggregation, the
related video recommendation is the main source of views
for the majority of the videos on YouTube. Furthermore,
our results reveal that there is a strong correlation between
the view count of a video and the average view count of its
top referrer videos. This implies that a video has a higher
chance to become popular when it is placed on the related
video recommendation lists of popular videos. We also ﬁnd
that the click through rate from a video to its related videos
is high and the position of a video in a related video list
plays a critical role in the click through rate. Finally, our
evaluation of the impact of the related video recommenda-
tion system on the diversity of video views indicates that
the current recommendation system helps to increase the
diversity of video views in aggregation.

INTRODUCTION
YouTube has been one of the most successful user-generated
video sharing sites since its establishment in early 2005. It is
estimated that there are over 100 million videos on YouTube
[9], which makes the exploration of the desired videos a
daunting task. In order to help users ﬁnd interesting videos
from a huge number of videos, YouTube provides several fea-
tures such as search engine, front page highlight, and related
videos recommendation.
YouTube can obtain the data on how users use these fea-
tures, which can be useful for improving its service. How-
ever, the understanding of how video views are driven by
these features is also helpful and interesting to outsiders
such as researchers, advertisers, and content providers. For
researchers, this is a case study of how contents in a large
repository are discovered and the evidence for the impor-
tance of content discovery tools. For content providers and
advertisers, this is useful for planning strategically to in-
crease their videos’ popularity and predicting the eﬀective-
ness of advertising. More recently, YouTube started to let
video content providers be partners to cash in on the videos
posted by sharing ad revenue and charging rental fees to
viewers [2]. This underscores the need to understand how
one can drive the views of a video.
In this paper, we perform a measurement study on data
sets of hundreds of thousands of videos crawled from YouTube
website. We study how videos are discovered by users, what
are the major sources that drive the views of a video, and
how well related video views are correlated. We summarize
our ﬁndings as follows.
• The related video recommendation is one of the most
important view sources of a video. Despite the fact
that the YouTube video search is the number one source
of views in aggregation, the related video recommenda-
tion is the main source of views for the majority of the
videos on YouTube. In particular, for a large portion
of videos with lukewarm popularity, the major source
of their views is from users clicking related videos.
• There is a strong correlation between the view count of
a video and the average view count of its top referrer
videos. This means that if the top referrer videos are
popular, then the video is also popular. This implies
a video has a higher chance to become popular when
404it is placed on the related video recommendation lists
of popular videos. Furthermore, the position that a
video is placed on the related video list plays a critical
role in the click through rate of the video.
• We evaluate the impact of the video recommendation
system on the diversity of video views.
In contrast
of recent results on the recommendation on book/CD
sales [6], we ﬁnd that YouTube recommendation pro-
vides more diversity on video views in aggregation than
that without the recommendation. This means that
YouTube recommendation helps viewers discover videos
of their interest rather than popular videos only.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2,
we describe the data sets used in this study. In Section 3, we
study the view sources for overall videos as well as individual
videos. In Section 4, we investigate how the related video
recommendation system aﬀects video views. The evaluation
of the impact of the related video recommendation system on
the diversity of video views is studied in Section 5. Related
work is described in Section 6 and ﬁnally, Section 7 concludes
the paper.
2. DATA DESCRIPTION
Our study is based on the data sets crawled from YouTube.
In this section, we ﬁrst describe three elements of data pro-
vided by YouTube. We then describe how we collected the
data sets.
2.1 Data Source
On YouTube, a video is viewed on a page named watch
page, which not only shows the video itself, but also includes
valuable data about the video. We focus on three elements of
the data. The ﬁrst element is video metadata, which includes
the basic information about the video, such as title, upload
time, and total view count. The second element is a related
video list, which contains the related videos recommended
by YouTube recommendation system. The third element is
view statistics & data, which includes the particular video’s
view count sequence over time, top ten view sources, and
the date of the ﬁrst referral and the number of views from
each source, as shown in Figure 1. By investigating the view
statistics & data, we ﬁnd that YouTube classiﬁes the sources
into 14 categories, such as YouTube Search, Related Video,
and Mobile Device. Each of them indicates a speciﬁc kind of
source, except for the Other/Viral category, which includes
all the view sources that do not fall into other categories.
For the category of Related Video, it also shows the video
that leads users to the current video. We refer to this video
as a referrer video of the current video.
2.2 Data Collection
In this section, we describe how we collected the two data
sets in this study. We start by describing how the data can
be obtained. The video metadata and related video list can
be retrieved through HTML scraping as well as YouTube
Data API, while the view statistics & data can only be re-
trieved through HTML because it is not supported by the
API.
We used two diﬀerent video sampling methods to obtain
our data sets to minimize the bias from data sampling. Our
results in the next section show that the trends of the results
from the two data sets are consistent with each other despite

the diﬀerent methods of video sampling. In the following,
we describe the crawling process for each data set. For D1,
we selected the videos by capturing and parsing YouTube
video requests at a university network gateway, and the three
elements of data associated with each video was collected
through crawling. For D2, we retrieved 400 featured videos
via API as the initial set, crawled their associated data, and
then crawled the data for their related videos. We did this
recursively in a breadth ﬁrst search manner for three levels.
Additionally, we crawled the metadata of referrer videos for
both D1 and D2 and the related video lists of referrer videos
for D2.
The data we collected and the approaches we used in the
collection are shown in Table 1, and the amount of data we
collected is shown in Table 2.

3. SOURCES OF VIDEO VIEWS
YouTube videos are accessed in a variety of ways, such
as through Google search, Facebook, mobile device, and
through the features provided on YouTube itself.
In this
section, we study which view source is the most frequently
used and which one is the major contributor of views for the
majority of the videos by investigating video view statistics
& data. As mentioned in Section 2.1, view statistics & data
405contains the top ten view sources and the number of views
from each source. We refer to the total views driven by the
top ten sources as the tracked views of a video. It is necessary
to verify ﬁrst whether the tracked views are representative.
3.1 Representativeness of Tracked Views
To justify that the tracked views are representative, we
use the percentage of tracked views from the total views of
a video, and the correlation between them as the criteria.
We calculate the percentage of tracked views for each video
in D1 and D2, and the average is 56.7% and 63.1%, respec-
tively. This means that, on average, the tracked views are
the majority of the total views. Further, the Cumulative
Distribution Function (CDF) of the percentage of tracked
views is shown in Figure 2. From the ﬁgure, there are around
70% of videos whose tracked views are larger than 50% of
the total views, which means that for the majority of videos,
more than half of their views are recorded in view statistics
& data.
In addition, we compute the Pearson’s correlation coeﬃ-
cient between tracked views and total views to measure the
linear correlation between them. The deﬁnition of Pearson’s
correlation coeﬃcient is given by
E[(X − μX )(Y − μY )]
,
ρX,Y =
cov(X, Y )
σX σY
=
σX σY
where ρX,Y is the correlation coeﬃcient between total views
X and tracked views Y with the expected value μX and μY ,
and the standard deviation σX and σY , respectively. The
Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients for D1 and D2 are 0.81 and
0.84, respectively. This indicates a strong linear correlation
between tracked views and video views in both data sets.
The correlation can be seen clearly in Figure 3, in which we
plot the number of tracked views and total views for each
video.
The high percentage of tracked views and the strong linear
correlation between tracked views and total views lead to our
conclusion that the tracked views can represent the total
video views well. We believe that the view pattern explored
by analyzing the tracked views is a good approximation of
the overall view pattern on YouTube.

Figure 3: Video views vs. tracked views.
views from each category of view sources is shown in Fig-
ure 4, which clearly shows that YouTube Search and Re-
lated Video are the top two categories. Views from YouTube
Search and Related Video together account for 66.88% and
56.06% of views in D1 and D2, respectively, while views
from sources outside YouTube such as Google search, Google
video search, Facebook and other sites only account for 7.6%
and 5.6% of views in D1 and D2, respectively. From the ﬁg-
ure, the percentage of views from Featured in D2 is much
higher than that in D1. This is probably due to the fact
that D2 was crawled with featured videos as the initial set.
Comparing the contribution made by Related Video and
YouTube Search, the results show that Related Video con-
tributed a bit less views (2.6% in D1 and 1.2% in D2) than
YouTube Search.
In conclusion, the related video recommendation is one of
the main sources of the video views. It accounts for about
30% of the overall views on YouTube, and is only second to
the YouTube Search by a small percentage.
Figure 4: Percentage of tracked views from each
category.
3.3 Dominant Sources for Individual Videos
Besides examining the main sources of overall views, we
also investigate view sources for each individual video. For
each video, we determine the category which contributes the
largest proportion of views, and call it the dominant cate-
gory. For example, if the YouTube Search contributes the
largest proportion of views to a video among all sources, then
YouTube Search is the dominant category of the video, in
other words, the video is dominated by YouTube Search.
The percentage of videos dominated by each category is
shown in Figure 5. In contrast to Figure 4, Figure 5 shows
406that more videos are dominated by Related Video than YouTube
Search. To show this clearly, we aggregate videos into three
types, which are Related dominated, Search dominated, and
Others. Table 3 shows the percentage of videos of each type
for D1 and D2. We can see that the percentage of videos
dominated by Related Video is the largest for both data sets.
Figure 5: Percentage of videos dominated by each
category.
For the disparity between the dominant category of over-
all views and individual video views, we further investigate
the union set (D1&D2) of D1 and D2 to ﬁnd out whether
the dominant categories are diﬀerent for videos with diﬀer-
ent popularity. We ﬁrst aggregate videos into groups with
view count range of one thousand views. Figure 6 shows
the number of videos of each type for diﬀerent view count
ranges. Among the unpopular videos (left part of the ﬁg-
ure), the number of Related dominated videos is the largest
among the three types.

Figure 7: Number of videos for each type after ag-

videos have the view count in the range of one thousand to
one million, and the number of Related dominated videos is
distinctly the largest in this range. Similarly, we aggregate
the videos by their view rates with the constant view rate
range of 100 views per day and diﬀerent view rate range.
As shown in Figure 8 and 9, the number of Related domi-
nated videos is always the largest, except for the extremely
popular videos which account for 1.2% of total videos.
