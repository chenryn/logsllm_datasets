When determining which method of a controller to invoke it can be important to
not decode url encodings, especially if the data on the REST request path
contains the / (forward slash) character. However once this data is passed to
the method as a parameter it would be nice to have it restored to its original
encoding. I propose adding an additional boolean which optionally url decodes
the return value from
AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.ServletHandlerMethodInvoker.resolvePathVariable
. This issues is particularly tricky as
AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter.ServletHandlerMethodInvoker is a private inner
class and cannot easily be overridden.
