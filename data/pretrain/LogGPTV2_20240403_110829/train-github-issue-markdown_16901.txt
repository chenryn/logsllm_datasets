# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**
`import.meta.url` is replaced by the current file location at the build time.  
https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/dependencies/ImportMetaPlugin.js#L99
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
If you build
    console.log(import.meta.url)
it will ouput a constant string (le location of the file on the current
system).
This is problematic to build a project using yargs
(https://github.com/yargs/yargs), as it uses `meta.import.url`
(https://github.com/yargs/yargs/blob/main/lib/platform-shims/esm.mjs#L18).
When building under an Unix file system, `meta.import.url` is replaced by
something like `file:///path/to/your/project/src/index.js`. When trying to run
the built code under a Windows filesystem, a `TypeError
[ERR_INVALID_FILE_URL_PATH]: File URL path must be absolute` is thrown, as the
filename doesn't contain `file://C:/...`.
Making the `meta.import.url` variable dynamic (based on __dirname) should
solve the problem.
**What is the expected behavior?**
`import.meta.url` should be based on `__dirname` for cjs build, to keep the
original intended behavior of the application developer.
