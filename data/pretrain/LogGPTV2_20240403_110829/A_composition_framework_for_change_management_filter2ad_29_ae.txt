### Leadership Support

#### 2.2 Leadership Support
**Concept Phase:**
- **Initiating**
- **Planning**
- **Executing**
- **Closing**

**Leadership Support** ensures that leaders at all organizational levels demonstrate visible support for the project. This begins in the Concept Process Phase with the identification and selection of a Project Sponsor. As the project progresses, key leaders are engaged to provide visible support, model change, and communicate the importance of the project to employees and stakeholders.

#### 2.2.1 Inputs
To complete the Concept Process Phase Leadership Support activities, the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:
- **Business Need:** The business need serves as the justification for the project and guides its direction.
- **Organization Chart:** The organization chart provides an accurate representation of the organization, its groups, and its people, demonstrating the structure and potential impact of leaders.

#### 2.2.2 Roles
The following roles and their associated responsibilities are involved in Leadership Support activities during the Concept Process Phase:

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **OCM Practitioner** | Conducts the Project Sponsorship Assessment. |
| **Executive Leadership** | Provides input for the Project Sponsorship Assessment and makes the final determination for the Project Sponsor role. |

#### 2.2.3 Activities
The primary activity of Leadership Support during the Concept Process Phase is to identify the Project Sponsor. This is completed using the Project Sponsorship Assessment, which is an informal working document designed to identify and evaluate potential Project Sponsor candidates.

**Identify the Project Sponsor:**
- The Project Sponsor plays a crucial role throughout the project lifecycle. The right sponsor can greatly increase the likelihood of success by influencing outcomes, securing resources, making decisions, and taking ownership of the project.
- If a Project Sponsor has already been selected, the assessment may not be necessary. However, it remains beneficial in situations where a new Project Sponsor needs to be chosen due to staff turnover or other factors.

**Assess Project Sponsor Candidates:**
- The OCM Practitioner should review the Organization Chart and business need, and complete the Project Sponsorship Assessment. This assessment helps to answer questions regarding the candidates' interests, influence, expectations, and availability.

**Select Project Sponsor:**
- After completing the Project Sponsorship Assessment, the OCM Practitioner analyzes the results by evaluating all Project Sponsor candidates against the eight criteria identified in the assessment. The OCM Practitioner should determine who best meets the criteria and work with executive leadership to make the final determination.

#### 2.2.4 Tools
The tool used by the OCM Practitioner within Leadership Support during the Concept Process Phase includes:
- **Project Sponsorship Assessment Template**

#### 2.2.5 Outputs

### Initiating Process Phase

#### 1.1 Introduction
The Initiating Process Phase is the second phase of the California Project Management Framework (CA-PMF) Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC). In this phase, OCM is formally initiated, and the OCM Practitioner begins to apply tools and techniques to the project. OCM efforts focus on addressing the OCM priorities identified in the Concept Process Phase, engaging the Project Sponsor and executives, and setting the foundation for a collaborative work environment for the project team.

#### 1.2 Recommended Practices
- **Focus OCM Efforts on Activities and Actions:** Completing project documents such as assessments, strategies, and plans is important, but creating a persuasive strategic vision and set of initiatives linked to that vision is key to developing and maintaining support.
- **Develop Active and Sustained Executive Support for Project Success:** Early and sustained executive leadership helps gain momentum for project approval and future phases. Engaged executives also provide visible support, encouraging employees and stakeholders to accept the change.
- **Keep Lessons Learned in Mind Throughout the Project:** Reviewing and implementing lessons learned from other projects reduces the chance of repeating mistakes and builds on successes. Project team members should document their own lessons learned informally as they execute the project.

#### Knowledge Areas
- **OCM Lifecycle Management:** Continues to address the organization's readiness for change and the areas needing OCM focus.
- **Leadership Support:** Focuses on the Project Sponsor and executive leaders who need to provide support and approval for the project.
- **Team Dynamics:** Defines the work environment for the project team, including identifying behavior guidelines.

Once the required activities in all active knowledge areas are completed, the OCM Practitioner will complete the OCM Initiating Process Phase Checklist, as described in section 3 of this chapter.
