Ensure Leadership Demonstrates Visible Support
Leadership Support ensures that the leadership at all levels of the organization 
demonstrate visible project support. This begins in the Concept Process Phase 
with identifying and/or selecting a Project Sponsor. As the project progresses 
and the Project Sponsor becomes engaged, leaders at all organizational levels 
are brought on board to provide visible support for the change. These leaders will 
be key in modeling support for the change and communicating the importance 
of the effort to employees and Stakeholders. The process phase goal and overall 
project goals related to Leadership Support are shown in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-5 summarizes the inputs, roles, skills, activities, tools, and outputs for 
Leadership Support in the Concept Process Phase.

2.2.1 Inputs
In order to complete the Concept Process Phase Leadership Support activities, 
the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:
Business Need: The business need serves as the justification for the project and 
guides its direction. The OCM Practitioner should have a clear understanding of 
the business need or problem in order to begin planning for the change.
Organization Chart: The organization chart provides an accurate representation 
of the organization, its groups, and its people. It demonstrates the organization’s 
structure and a leader’s potential impact and reach.

determination for the Project Sponsor role
2.2.3 Activities
The primary activity of Leadership Support during the Concept Process Phase 
is  to  identify  the  Project  Sponsor.  This  is  completed  by  using  the  Project 
Sponsorship Assessment. This assessment is designed to be an informal working 
document that identifies and evaluates potential Project Sponsor candidates.
It is important to note that an organization may have already selected a Project 
Sponsor for the effort. In this case, it is not necessary to complete the Project 
Sponsorship Assessment to select a Project Sponsor. However, the activity listed 
below remains beneficial in a situation where a new Project Sponsor needs to 
be chosen, either for subsequent phases, due to staff turnover, or other factors. 
The OCM Practitioner may need to revisit this activity in future process phases 
as the need arises.
Identify the Project Sponsor
The Project Sponsor plays an important role throughout the project lifecycle 
and choosing the right one can greatly increase the likelihood of success. The 
Project  Sponsor  needs  to  have  many  capabilities,  including  the  abilities  to 
influence outcomes, secure resources and funding, make influential decisions, 
and  take  ownership  in  the  project.  The  Project  Sponsor  advocates  for  the 
project by continually communicating commitment to it. Ultimately, the Project 
Sponsor is responsible for the realization of the project’s benefits.

Assess Project Sponsor Candidates
To identify Project Sponsor candidates, the OCM Practitioner should review the 
Organization Chart and business need, and complete the Project Sponsorship 
Assessment.  This  assessment  helps  to  answer  questions  regarding  Project 
Sponsor  candidates’  interests,  influence,  expectations,  and  availability.  The 
assessment should be completed thoughtfully in order to provide the information 
necessary for selecting a Project Sponsor. The OCM Practitioner will need to work 
with the appropriate executive leadership of the organization to complete this 
activity.
Select Project Sponsor
Once the Project Sponsorship Assessment is complete, the OCM Practitioner 
will  analyze  the  results  by  evaluating  all  Project  Sponsor  candidates  against 
the  eight  criteria  identified  in  the  assessment.  The  OCM  Practitioner  should 
determine who best meets the criteria using careful and thoughtful evaluation. 
One candidate may not be the best Project Sponsor due to limited availability. 
Another  candidate  may  not  be  suited  due  to  a  lack  of  influence.  The  OCM 
Practitioner should use his/her knowledge of the organization, the environment, 
and the Project Sponsor candidates to identify and influence the selection of 
the  Project  Sponsor  moving  forward.  Once  the  OCM  Practitioner  identifies  a 
suitable Project Sponsor candidate, he/she should work with the appropriate 
executive leadership of the organization make a final determination for the role.

Process Phase Checklist
3.1  Complete the Checklist
Once all of the OCM activities within the Concept Process Phase are accomplished, 
the process phase checklist should be completed. The checklist provides a list 
of questions built around why, how, what, who, where, and when, which can 
help verify if everything required for completing the process phase is in place.
The process phase checklist helps to identify and document r
epeatable steps, 
from project to project, to ensure that the correct activities are completed at 
the right time, every time. Process phase checklists assist the OCM Practitioner 
in  quickly  and  confidently  identifying  incomplete  areas  within  this  process 
phase. The checklist provides a clear milestone that the Concept Process Phase 
is complete, including:

The  Initiating  Process  Phase  is  the  second  phase  of  the  California  Project 
Management Framework (CA-PMF) Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC). In this 
process phase, OCM is formally initiated and the OCM Practitioner begins to apply 
tools and techniques to the project. OCM efforts focus on addressing the OCM 
priorities identified in the Concept Process Phase, engaging the Project Sponsor 
and executives, and setting the foundation for a collaborative work environment 
for the project team.
1.1  Introduction
The Initiating Process Phase signals the start of business analysis and building a 
compelling business case with the Problem Statement developed in the Concept 
Process Phase. It is also the time to integrate OCM efforts into the overall change 
initiative. It is important to begin OCM activities early in the project lifecycle to 
engage  leaders  and  plan  for  activities  that  inform  and  engage  Stakeholders. 
OCM efforts completed in this process phase will prepare the organization and 
its people for the change initiative. Three knowledge areas are active during the 
Initiating Process Phase: OCM Lifecycle Management, Leadership Support, and 
Team Dynamics.
Initiating | Page 3

Organizational Change Management Framework
OCM Lifecycle Management
In  the  Concept  Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  began  to  identify  the 
organization’s readiness for change and the areas needing OCM focus. This work 
continues in the Initiating Process Phase to address the change magnitude and 
priorities.
Leadership Support
As the Initiating Process Phase occurs relatively early in the PMLC, Leadership 
Support  activities  continue  to  focus  on  the  Project  Sponsor  and  executive 
leaders who need to provide support and approval for the project to proceed. 
The OCM Practitioner will focus efforts on informing and engaging the Project 
Sponsor in the change initiative during this process phase. The OCM Practitioner 
will work with the Project Sponsor to detail an approach to address the needs of 
other key executive leaders.
Team Dynamics
The Initiating Process Phase signals the need to define the work environment 
for the project team. During this process phase, the OCM Practitioner identifies 
the team’s behavior guidelines in preparation for establishing the formal project 
team.
Once the required activities in all active knowledge areas are completed, the 
OCM  Practitioner  will  complete  the  OCM  Initiating  Process  Phase  Checklist, 
as described in section 3 of this chapter. Figure 1-2 illustrates the overarching 
goals, as well as inputs, activities, and outputs of the three knowledge areas 
that occur in this process phase.

1.2  Recommended Practices
The following recommended practices will help ensure that appropriate OCM 
activities are taking place in the Initiating Process Phase.
Focus OCM Efforts on Activities and Actions
OCM is a vital component of project success; however, it is important to note 
that completing project documents such as assessments, strategies, and plans 
will not guarantee the success of an OCM effort. Creating a persuasive strategic 
vision  and  set  of  initiatives  linked  to  that  vision  are  key  to  developing  and 
maintaining an effective collation of support. Once support is enlisted, the OCM 
Practitioner should lead and monitor OCM activities and tasks as prescribed in 
the project documentation.
Develop Active and Sustained Executive Support for  
Project Success
Executive leadership that is developed early and maintained throughout the 
project lifecycle will help a project gain the momentum it needs for approval, 
as well as for future process phases. Engaged executives also provide visible 
support, which demonstrates their commitment to the project and encourages 
employees and Stakeholders to accept the change.
Keep Lessons Learned in Mind Throughout the Project
Early  in  the  OCM  effort,  it  is  important  to  take  the  time  to  seek  out  lessons 
learned that have been developed by other projects or different parts of the 
organization. By reviewing and implementing these lessons learned, it reduces 
the chance of repeating the mistakes others have experienced and build upon 
their successes.
On an ongoing basis, project team members should be encouraged to informally 
document their own lessons learned as they are executing the project. Lessons 
learned sessions are normally conducted at the end of the project or with the 
completion of a phase or milestone; in some cases, a lot of time may have passed 
from when an event occurred to when a lessons learned session takes place. 
Individually documenting the lessons learned ahead of time will ensure that 
project team members are able to remember all the successes and challenges 
that have happened.
