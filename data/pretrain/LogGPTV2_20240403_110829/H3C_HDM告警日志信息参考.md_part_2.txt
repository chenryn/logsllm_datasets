简介
1
本文档主要介绍HDM告警日志的相关信息。
1.1 使用场景
当设备发生故障或某些原因导致系统处于不正常的工作状态时，系统能够根据不同模块出现的故障
产生告警，同时生成事件日志信息。用户获取到日志信息后，再通过日志信息中的相应字段在本文
档中搜索定位到该日志信息，即可了解该日志信息的详细内容和处理建议，从而方便维护服务器的
正常运行。
1.2 获取方式
• 通过HDM Web页面获取：登录到HDM Web页面，单击[远程运维/日志]菜单项，选择“一键
收集”页签，进入一键收集页面，根据需要下载日志。
• 通过告警邮件获取：若用户已完成告警邮件的相关配置，可通过告警邮件获取设备告警信息。
• 通过第三方平台获取：若用户已完成SNMP的相关配置，实现了HDM与第三方管理平台对
接，则可通过第三方管理平台获取设备告警信息。
• 通过Redfish事件订阅服务器获取：若用户已完成远程订阅服务器的配置，当触发告警时，
Redfish会将接收到的告警信息上传到远程订阅服务器。
• 通过IPMI命令获取：通过IPMItool以命令行的方式访问HDM的IPMI接口，输入获取SEL
日志的命令，可以获取事件日志信息。
1.3 告警级别
服务器系统的告警包含服务器系统所有部件产生的告警，当产生告警时，需要根据告警信息来定位
告警产生的具体原因，告警信息按严重性分为四个等级。
• 正常（Info）：
服务器正常运行产生的事件日志，不影响服务器正常运行，无需处理。
• 轻微（Minor）：
当前未对系统产生大影响，但可能存在一定风险和隐患，可对相关事件进行观察，必要时采取相应
的措施，防止故障升级。
• 严重（Major）：
已对系统产生较大的影响，有可能中断系统或业务模块（计算、存储、通信、用户数据安全性）的
正常运行，导致业务中断。
• 紧急（Critical）：
因出现系统处理单元能力严重下降、系统可用资源明显减少、业务处理能力严重下降、业务模块大
面积中断、存储设备不可用等现象，导致（或极可能导致）服务器失效、系统宕机、业务数据丢失
等情况出现的，需要立即进行处理的告警。

1.4 内容说明
本文以表格的形式对告警日志信息进行介绍，各项的含义请参见表1-1。
表1-1 告警日志信息说明
表项 说明 举例
0x02900002
可以通过事件码的最后一位的奇偶性来
判断是告警触发还是告警解除。
事件码 唯一标识一条告警日志信息，用16进制数来表示
• 偶数：告警触发
• 奇数：告警解除
显示日志信息的具体内容。
Exceeded the upper major
日志内容 如出现多条内容一样的日志，可以通过上报的传 threshold.---Current
感器类型来区分 reading:$1---Threshold reading:$2
• $1：电压传感器的当前读数
对日志中出现的参数进行解释，参数名称用“$数
参数解释 字”表示，如$1：XXXX • $2：电压传感器的严重高压告警阈
值
日志等级 日志等级 严重
Exceeded the upper major
举例 日志真实举例内容 threshold.---Current
reading:2.58---Threshold reading:2.56
整机输入电压高于严重级别的电压告警
日志说明 解释日志信息的含义和生成原因 阈值，告警触发部件请参见HDM Web“事
件日志”页面的传感器名称
1. 检查服务器外部供电环境是否处于
正常状态，如果否，请检修外部供
电环境问题；如果是，请执行下一
步操作
建议用户应采取哪些处理措施，对于建议措施无
处理建议 2. 登录HDM Web页面确认电源模块
法解决的问题，请联系技术支持
是否处于正常状态，如果否，请更
换电源模块；如果是，请执行下一
步操作
3. 若问题仍然存在，请联系技术支持
