Using  the  asymptotic  formulas  of  Theorem  1,  we  can 
distinguish  five  different  domains  such  that  n,C→∞,  for 
which  the asymptotic distribution of the random variable 
µ(n,C) is different. These domains are: 
- the central domain (CD for short), when n=Θ(C);

- the  right-hand  domain  (RHD  for  short),  when  n= 
Θ(ClogC); 
- the left-hand domain (LHD for short), when n=Θ( C ); 
- the  right-hand  intermediate  domain  (RHID  for  short), 
when n=Ω(C) but C logC >> n;2 
- the  left-hand  intermediate  domain  (LHID  for  short), 
when n=O(C) but n>> C . 
The following theorem describes the limit distribution 
of µ(n,C) in the different domains. 
Theorem 2. The limit distribution of the random variable 
µ(n,C) is:  
- the  normal  distribution  of  parameters  (E[µ(n,C)],

Consider 
3  Probabilistic analysis of MTR for 
stationary networks 
the  probability  space 
(Ωl,Fl,Pl),  where 
Ωl=[0,l], Fl is the family of all closed subsets of Ωl and Pl 
is a probability distribution on Ωl. In this paper, we assume 
that Pl is the uniform distribution on Ωl. Under this setting, 
nodes  in  N  can  be  modeled  as  independent  random 
variables  uniformly  distributed  in  [0,l],  which  will  be 
denoted Z1,…,Zn. 
We  say  that  an  event  Vk,  describing  a  property  of  a 
random  structure  depending  on  a  parameter  k,  holds 
asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s. for short), if P(Vk) →1 
as  k→∞.  In  the  following  we  consider  the  asymptotic 
behavior  of  the  event  CONNECTEDl  on  the  random 
structures  (Ωl,Fl,Pl)  as  l→∞.  Informally  speaking,  event 
CONNECTEDl corresponds to all the values of the random 
variables  Z1,..,Zn  for  which  the  communication  graph  is 
connected.  
The  following  upper  bound  on  the  magnitude  of  rn 
ensuring a.a.s. connectedness has been derived in [1]. 
Theorem 3. Suppose n nodes are placed in [0,l] according 
to the uniform distribution. If rn∈Θ(l log l) and r>>1, then 
the communication graph is a.a.s. connected. 
2  Notation  f(x)>g(x))  is  used  to  denote  the  fact  that 
f(x)/g(x)→0 (resp., ∞) as x→∞. 
Observe that the constraint r>>1 in the statement of the 
theorem  is  not  restrictive,  since  we  are  interested  in 
investigating the magnitudes of r such that 1=
