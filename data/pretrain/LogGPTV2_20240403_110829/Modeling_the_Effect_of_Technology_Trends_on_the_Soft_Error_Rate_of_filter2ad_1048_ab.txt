Figure 2. Process for determining the Soft Error Rate in a logic chain
	 refers to the amount of charge collected due to the
particle strike. The parameter T is the time constant for the
charge collection process and is a property of the CMOS
process used for the device. If T is large it takes more time
for the charge to recombine. If T is small, the charge re-
combines rapidly, generating a current pulse with a short
duration. The time constant decreases as feature size de-
creases, and Hazucha & Svensson developed a method for
scaling the time constant based on feature size [10]. The
rapid rise of the current pulse is captured in the square root
function and the gradual fall of the current pulse is produced
by the negative exponential dependence.
The current pulse produced by a particle strike results in
a voltage pulse at the output node of the device. We use a
Spice simulation to determine the rise time, fall time and
effective duration of this voltage pulse. These three values
are the ﬁnal result of this stage and become the input for the
next phase, the electrical masking analytical model.
4.3 Electrical masking model
Electrical masking is the composition of two electri-
cal effects that reduce the strength of a pulse as it passes
through a logic gate. Circuit delays caused by the switch-
ing time of the transistors cause the rise and fall time of
the pulse to increase. Also, the amplitude of a pulse with
short duration may decrease since the gate may start to turn
off before the output reaches its full amplitude. The combi-
nation of these two effects reduces the duration of a pulse,
making it less likely to cause a soft error. The effect cas-
cades from one gate to the next because at each gate the
slope decreases and hence the amplitude also decreases.
We constructed a model for electrical masking by com-
bining two existing models. We use the Horowitz rise and
fall time model [13] to determine the rise and fall time of
the output pulse, and the Logical Delay Degradation Effect
Model [3] to determine the amplitude, and hence the dura-
tion, of the output pulse.
Horowitz rise and fall time model: The Horowitz model
calculates the rise and fall time of the output pulse based
on the the input rise and fall time, the CMOS model param-
eters, and the gate switching voltages. The gate switching
voltages are determined using an iterative bisection method.
This procedure adjusts the switching voltages until the rise
and fall times predicted by the model are within 15% of
values obtained from Spice simulations.
Delay degradation model: Delay degradation occurs
when an input transition occurs before the gate has com-
pletely switched from its previous transition. When this
occurs, the gate switches in the opposite direction before
reaching the peak amplitude of the input pulse, thus de-
grading the amplitude of the output pulse. We use the “De-
lay Degradation Model” proposed and validated by Bellido-
Diaz et al. [3] to determine how a voltage pulse degrades as
it passes through a logic gate. This model determines the
amplitude of the output pulse based on the time between
the output transition and the next input transition, and the
time needed for the gate to switch fully.
4.4 Pulse latching model
Recall that our deﬁnition of a soft error in combinational
logic requires an error pulse to be captured in a memory
circuit. Therefore, in our model a soft error occurs when
the error pulse is stored into the level-sensitive latch at the
end of a logic chain. We only consider a value to be stored
in the latch if it is present and stable when the latch closes,
since this value is passed to the next pipeline stage.
When a voltage pulse reaches the input of a latch, we
use a Spice simulation to determine if it has sufﬁcient am-
plitude and duration to be captured by the latch. By keeping
the rise and fall time constant, but varying the duration, the
simulation determines the minimum duration (measured at
the threshold voltage) pulse that could be latched. If the du-
ration of the pulse at the latch input exceeds this minimum
duration, it has the potential to cause a soft error.
This method determines if a particle-induced pulse in an
otherwise stable, correct input signal is strong enough to
be latched. It is also possible that a particle-induced pulse
could delay the correct input signal from arriving at the latch
input in time to be latched, thus causing an error. This type
of error is referred to as a delay fault. Due to the complexity
of modeling these faults, we have chosen to exclude them
from our study. Bernstein found that delay faults are neg-
ligible in current technologies due to the common design
practice of incorporating a 5%-10% safety margin into the

clock cycle [4]. However, such faults could become much
more common as clock frequency increases and safety mar-
gins are squeezed to increase performance.
4.5 Latching-window masking model
A latch is only vulnerable to a soft error during a small
window around its closing clock edge. The size of this
latching window is simply the minimum duration pulse that
can be latched, which depends on the pulse rise and fall
time. A pulse that is present at the latch input through-
out the entire latching window will be latched and causes
a soft error. If a pulse partially overlaps the latching win-
dow, there is the possibility that it may also cause a soft er-
ror, since it could prevent the data from satisfying the latch
setup and hold time requirements. We believe this is a sec-
ondary effect and therefore we have ignored it in our model.
This simpliﬁcation results in a more conservative estimate
of SER. Figure 3 illustrates our model of latching window
masking. Only a pulse that completely overlaps the latch-
ing window results in a soft error. If the pulse either arrives
after the latching window has opened, terminates before the
latching window closes, or does not have sufﬁcient duration
to cover the whole window, we assume that the pulse will
be masked.
Let d represent the duration of the pulse on arrival at the
latch input at time . The pulse arrival time  can occur at
any point in the clock cycle with equal probability. Let w
represent the size of the latching window for this pulse, and
let c represent the clock cycle time. If a latching window
for the latch starts after time  and ends before time   d,
the pulse is present at the latch input throughout the entire
latching window and results in a soft error. Otherwise the
pulse is masked and no soft error occurs.
We can determine the probability that the pulse causes
a soft error by computing the probability that a randomly
placed interval of length d overlaps a ﬁxed interval of length
w within an overall interval of length c. This probability is
given in by the following equation:
Prfsoft errorg = 8 c  w
Note that when d < w, the probability of a soft error
is zero, but this is not an effect of latching window mask-
ing, since the pulse does not have sufﬁcient duration to be
latched. On the other hand, when the pulse duration ex-
ceeds c  w, it is assured to overlap at least one full latching
window of size w and hence has probability 1 of causing a
soft error. Note that a smaller pulse could partially overlap
the latching windows in two consecutive clock cycles with-
out fully containing either one. Since pulse arrival times
are distributed uniformly at random over the clock cycle,
the probability of an error for a pulse with any intermedi-
ate duration is a simple linear function between these two
endpoints.
4.6 Estimating SER for combinational logic
We assume that the probability of concurrent particle
strikes in a single logic chain is negligible, and thus the
SER for the circuit is simply the sum of the SER’s for a
particle strike at each gate in the logic chain. To compute
the SER contribution for a given gate in the logic chain, we
simulate a particle strike to the drain of the gate using our
charge to voltage pulse model. Then we apply our electrical
masking model to determine the characteristics of the volt-
age pulse when it reaches the latch input. We use the pulse-
latching model to determine if the pulse that reaches the
latch input has sufﬁcient amplitude and duration to cause a
soft error. As in memory circuits, the smallest charge that
can generate a pulse that results in a soft error is the critical
charge (	CR T ) for the circuit. For combinational logic, we
are also interested in 	C AX, the smallest charge that has
probability of 1 of being latched according to our latching-
window masking model. Charge values between 	CR T
and 	C AX have the potential to be masked by latching-
window masking, but charge values of 	C AX or greater
always result in a soft error.
To complete the calculation of SER for a given gate
in the logic chain, we divide the charge values between
	CR T and 	C AX into  equal-size intervals. We used
 = 20 for the results presented in this paper; using sep-
arate experiments we validated that using a higher granu-
larity has only a marginal effect on the resulting SER es-
timates. We compute the SER corresponding to each in-
terval using the model of Hazucha & Svensson. Since the
Hazucha & Svensson model gives a cumulative SER value,
we compute the SER for an interval by subtracting the SER
of the right endpoint of the interval from that of the left. The
SER for the interval is then weighted by the probability that
a soft error occurs as given by our latching-window mask-
ing model. The contribution to SER for the gate is then the
sum of the weighted SER’s for each interval plus the SER
for 	C AX. This calculation is summarized with the fol-
lowing formula:
