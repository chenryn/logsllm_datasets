User: is it bad to output many files to the same directory in unix/linux? I run thousands of jobs on a cluster and each outputs a file, to one directory.  The upper bound here is around ~50,000 files.  Can IO be limited in speed in light of this?  If so, does the problem go away with a nested directory structure?
Thanks.
Assistant: My suggestion is to use nested directory structure (ie categorization). You can name them using timestamps, special prefixes for each application etc. This gives you a sense of order when you need to search for specific files and for easier management of your files.
