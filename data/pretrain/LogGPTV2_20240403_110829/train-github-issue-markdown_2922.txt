`deno run [OPTIONS] ...` doesn't use import maps to resolve
``. For example, consider:
    $ deno run https://deno.land/std@0.148.0/examples/welcome.ts
    Welcome to Deno!
This could be rewritten to use an import map but that's unsupported:
    $ cat > mods.json ` to use the import map resolution like the rest of a
Deno project is useful for users wishing to keep all their dependency versions
in one file. For example, I have a repo with an import map pinned to a
specific standard library version:
    {
      "imports": {
        // many other imports
        "std/": "https://deno.land/std@0.148.0/"
      }
    }
And a deno.json with tasks that try to duplicate that version but they often
get out of sync and I lose that nice view into seeing all my dependencies in
one place:
    {
      "tasks": {
        "dev:serve": "deno -q run --allow-read=. --allow-net https://deno.land/std@0.149.0/http/file_server.ts dist",
      }
    }
I'd like it to be:
    {
      "tasks": {
        "dev:serve": "deno -q run --allow-read=. --allow-net std/http/file_server.ts dist",
      }
    }
