User: I have made a simple python script and built a 64-bit Windows executable from it via pyinstaller. However, most computers at my office run 32-bit Windows operating systems, thus my program does not work. From what I have read, it is possible to make an executable for 32-bit systems as long as I use the 32-bit version of python. So I went ahead and installed the 32-bit version of python 3.5, but I can't find the way to link pip to the 32-bit version of python so I can install all the necessary modules. Every time I call pip it displays all the modules that are installed on the 64-bit version, even though by default I am running the 32-bit version python.
Assistant: I had a similar problem with both 32 and 64-bit versions of Python installed. I found if I ran the pip install in the command prompt from the location of pip.exe it worked fine. In my case, the file path was the following:
C:\Program Files\Python\3.5\Scripts
