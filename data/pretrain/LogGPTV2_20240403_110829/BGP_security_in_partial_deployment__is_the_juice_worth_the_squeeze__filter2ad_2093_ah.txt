Our metric is:
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
m∈M
d∈D\{m}
HM,D(S) =
|D|(|M|−1)(|V |−2)
1
H(m, d, S)
Since we cannot predict where an attack will come from, or
which ASes it will target, the metric averages over all attack-
ers in a set M and destinations in a set D; we can choose M
and D to be any subset of the ASes in the graph, depend-
ing on (i) where we expect attacks to come from, and (ii)
which destinations we are particularly interested in protect-
ing. When we want to capture the idea that all destinations
are of equal importance, we average over all destinations;
note that “China’s 18 minute mystery” of 2010 [14] ﬁts into
this framework well, since the hijacker targeted preﬁxes orig-
inated by a large number of (seemingly random) destination
ASes. However, we can also zoom in on important destina-
tions D (e.g., content providers [9,31,42]) by averaging over
those destinations only. We can, analogously, zoom in on
certain types of attackers M by averaging over them only.
Averaging over ﬁxed sets D and M (that are independent
of S) also allows us to compare security across deployments
S and routing policy models.

ing decision up to the tiebreak step TB of its routing pol-
icy. Since computing HM,D(S) only requires us to distin-
guish between “happy” and “unhappy” ASes, the tiebreak
step matters only when a source AS s has to choose be-
tween (1) an insecure route(s) to the legitimate destination
d (that makes it happy), and (2) an insecure bogus route(s)
to m (that makes it unhappy). Importantly, s has no idea
which route is bogus and which is legitimate, as both of
them are insecure. Therefore, to avoid making uninformed
guesses about how ASes choose between equally-good inse-
cure routes, we will compute upper and lower bounds on
our metric; to get a lower bound, we assume that every AS
s in the aforementioned situation will always choose to be
unhappy (i.e., option (2)); the upper bound is obtained by
assuming s always chooses to be happy (i.e., (1)). See also

Algorithms.
Our metric is determined by computing
routing outcomes, each requiring time O(|V |), over all pos-
sible |M||D| attacker and destination pairs. We sometimes
take M = D = V so that our computations approach O(|V |3);
the parallel algorithms we developed for this purpose are
presented in Appendix B, H.
4.2 Origin authentication gives good security.
At this point, we could compute the metric for various
S*BGP deployment scenarios, show that most source ASes
are “happy”, argue that S*BGP has improved security, and
conclude our analysis. This, however, would not give us the
full picture, because it is possible that most of the happy
ASes would have been happy even if S*BGP had not been de-
ployed. Thus, to understand if the juice is worth the squeeze,
we need to ask how many more attacks are prevented by a
particular S*BGP deployment scenario, relative to those al-
ready prevented by RPKI with origin authentication. More
concretely, we need to compare the fraction of happy ASes
before and after the ASes in S deploy S*BGP. To do this, we
compare the metric for a deployment scenario S against the
“baseline scenario”, where RPKI and origin authentication
are in place, but no AS has adopted S*BGP, so that the set
of secure ASes is S = ∅.
In [22], the authors evaluated the eﬃcacy of origin authen-
tication against attacks that it was not designed to prevent
— namely, the “m, d” attack of Section 3.1. They randomly
sampled pairs of attackers and destinations and plotted the
distribution of the fraction of “unhappy” source ASes (ASes
that route through the attacker, see Table 2). Figure 3 of [22]
