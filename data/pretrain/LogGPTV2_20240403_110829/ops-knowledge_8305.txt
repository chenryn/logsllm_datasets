User: How to implement dtls protocol using twisted with m2crypto (or pyopenssl)?
Assistant: Neither pyOpenSSL nor M2Crypto exposes OpenSSL's DTLS features (as far as I know).  So, the first step would be to extend one of these libraries to support it.  After that, you could extend Twisted to use the new features you just added to the underlying SSL library.
