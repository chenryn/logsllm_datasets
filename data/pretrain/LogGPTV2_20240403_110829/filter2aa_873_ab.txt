For one example of how low one can limbo, see recent revelations of the Murdoch caper, 
imagine much more, then know that you can’t begin to imagine what they do. Or ... 
perhaps you can. If it is your work, too.   
The nature of intelligence work has been changed by evolving technologies. 
In my presentation for the New Paradigms in Security Workshop, CHANGING 
CONTEXTS OF SECURITY AND ETHICS: YOU CAN’T HAVE ONE 
WITHOUT THE OTHER (NPSW 2008), I said: 
“Information security as one task, both offensive and defensive, of the intelligence 
community sanctions breaking foreign laws while prohibiting similar activities on 
American soil. But simple distinctions of “foreign” and “domestic” no longer hold. The 
convergence of enabling technologies of intrusion, interception, and panoptic reach, 
combined with a sense of urgency about the counter terror imperative and a clear 
mandate from our leaders to do everything possible to defeat an amorphous non-state 
entity defined by behaviors rather than boundaries, borders, or even a clear ideological 
allegiance, has created an ominous but invisible and seemingly inevitable set of 
conditions that undermine previous cornerstones of law, ethics, even religious traditions. 
therefore: Security professionals exercise an implicit, de facto thought leadership 
because they create structures that bind and inform society and civilization. Their real 
implicit charge is not “to defend and protect a nation” but to stabilize a world. 
The dire possibility of societal disintegration elevates the moral responsibility of the 
security and intelligence communities to a higher level. Linked in cooperative activity, 
they are responsible for maintaining social and global order at a level of understanding 
far beyond that formulated in the past by any one nation. These communities in the 
aggregate constitute a global community of practitioners who share an ethos and 
modalities of operation not available to ordinary citizens; they have thereby created for 
themselves an intrinsic vocation or calling to maintain global order in a way that 
is consistent with the ethical norms and moral order articulated by the great cultural 
traditions even as those traditions are also transformed by diverse technologies—and 
even though they and we recognize that in practice that moral order and those ethical 
norm are often violated as a matter of practice. 
9 
A primary goal of security and intelligence work, as it is practiced, is to tell people that 
the world in which they will wake up will be pretty much the world in which they fell 
asleep.  
IOW, stability, persistence of structures even as they morph, continuity of identities (even 
as they morph) – the same work as that done by the human organism, in effect, as it has 
evolved, managing cellular changes, environmental disruptions, and genetic mutations. 
Next: we do this in the context of a world within the world, a secretive world if not a 
secret world, which since 9/11 has grown and grown ... and grown ...  
Dana Priest and William Arkin wrote in the Washington Post, 7/19/2010 – of a hidden 
world, growing beyond control – “The top-secret world the government created in 
response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, has become so large, so unwieldy 
and so secretive that no one knows how much money it costs, how many people it 
employs, how many programs exist within it or exactly how many agencies do the 
same work. 
* 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs 
related to counter terrorism, homeland security and intelligence in 10,000 locations 
across the United States. 
* 854,000 people, nearly 1.5 times as many people as live in Washington, D.C., hold 
top-secret security clearances. 
* In Washington and the surrounding area, 33 building complexes for top-secret 
intelligence work are under construction or have been built since September 2001. 
They occupy the equivalent of three Pentagons or 22 U.S. Capitol buildings - 17 million 
square feet of space. 
* Many security and intelligence agencies do the same work, creating redundancy and 
waste. For example, 51 federal organizations and military commands, operating in 15 
U.S. cities, track the flow of money to and from terrorist networks. 
Analysts who make sense of documents and conversations obtained by foreign and 
domestic spying publish 50,000 intelligence reports each year, a volume so large that 
many are routinely ignored. 
As a corollary, read my short story, Break, Memory, in “Mind Games,” which illuminates 
how the masters of society manage the humplings – the 80% in the hump of the bell 
curve – and maintain the dregs as an example to the humplings. They do this in a world 
of increasing longevity by distributing memories throughout the population so all the 
memories are there, but only they have the algorithms and keys to the code for recovery 
and reassembly, thereby preventing older wiser people (silverbacks, we call ourselves) 
from talking to one another about relevant events and building the Big Picture. 
10 
In addition - recent US political discourse is about how much money must be cut by the 
government – but wars and empire and the big money for “defense” (fighting in Iraq, 
Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia etc.) are seldom discussed. 
“For the 2010 fiscal year, the president's base budget of the Department of Defense rose 
to $533.8 billion. Adding spending on "overseas contingency operations" brings the sum 
to $663.8 billion.  When the budget was signed into law on October 28, 2009, the final 
size of the DoD’s budget was $680 billion, $16 billion more than President Obama had 
requested. Defense-related expenditures outside DoD constitute $216 billion - $361 
billion in additional spending, bringing total defense spending to $880 billion - $1.03 
trillion in fiscal 2010 
The U.S. DoD budget accounted in fiscal 2010 for 19% of the US federal budgeted 
expenditures and 28% of estimated tax revenues. Including non-DOD expenditures, 
defense spending was approximately 25–29% of budgeted expenditures and 38–44% 
of estimated tax revenues. According to the Congressional Budget Office. defense 
spending grew 9% annually on average from fiscal year 2000–2009.” 
A friend recalled a conversation with the late great Bob Abbot. My friend said: "Ahhh... 
I get it, you're a spy." Abbot corrected me and said, "no, spies *work* for me...".  
THE LESSON  YOU CAN NOT SEPARATE SECURITY FROM THE VAST DARK 
CAVE IN WHICH IS TAKES PLACE, THE WORLD OF BLACK AND GRAY 
OPERATIONS, MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE WORK, A WORLD WITHIN THE 
WORLD, WITH MASSIVE ENGINES OF FUNDING AND THEREFORE 
DIRECTION OF THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL-ENTERTAINMENT-MEDIA-
EDUCATIONAL COMPLEX.  
In this context, let’s discuss INFORMATION SECURITY. 
First, “vendor-space.” (all of these quotes and subsequent quotes are from friends 
chatting about their work. They are anonymized to protect the innocent and guilty. They 
are spontaneous and based on long experience, and you can recognize I hope that they are 
“what’s so.”  
What is the security business? It is what it is. 
An example from vendorspace: 
We deal with vendors every day.  The vendor is brought to us by an enterprise that is 
licensing code from the vendor either to deploy internally, use in software they are 
building, or bundle.  We analyze their code. There is typically resistance from the vendor 
to send their code to us that ranges from, "this is a pain in the ass but I guess I have to 
make my sale" to "I am going to complain and drag my feet, threaten things but give in 
with some small concessions" to "no way, I am the big cheese, I am not going to let you 
have a 3rd party assessment".  Where a vendor falls along this spectrum parallels the 
11 
economic leverage the enterprise customer has over the vendor.  If the enterprise is the 
size of a Barclays or a Dell and the vendor is small, the vendor capitulates quickly. If the 
vendor and customer are the same size (think midsize bank and big Indian outsourcer) 
then there is more hemming and hawing but the vendor eventually gives in.  If the vendor 
is huge and the customer is smaller than the US govt the vendor says no since they have 
market power. This is sort of like the US not going along with international treaties. They 
don't go along because they can get away with it. 
Let’s port a metaphor from the world of cyber security to the social political world: 
“You do not know what assumptions the system is making,.” says a security expert 
retired from CIA. “What assumptions are implicit in the architecture of the system? 
You can not query the system about assumptions, hence you can’t query it to reveal its 
flaws (or back doors.). The system is not self-aware. What does the system think it knows 
that it may not know? People who build systems do not understand that principle.” 
OR THEY DO UNDERSTAND IT AND MAKE USE OF IT 
“The environment in which the logic is running is simply an unknown from a 
security standpoint.  This means the environment needs to be audited too. It is not a 
good idea to use new environments for security critical code. When PHP came out 
people rushed to it because it was easy to use but look at all the problems that came down 
the road.” 
We’re talking about nested levels of unconscious assumptions about the security 
industry, the security enterprise .... security, period, as a “mind space” that is 
leveraged for economic, political, and social advantage.  
The internet was built on an “US” model. It was built for trust and ease of access. The 
context of security is predicated on an us/them model – us is good, them is bad. Us is 
safety, them is threat. But as Pogo said, we have met the enemy and it is us. 
In this context, what does the word “security” really mean?  
A security expert with decades of experience surveyed that vendor expo floor out there –
vendorspace - a couple of years ago  and said: “every single one is selling something 
that can’t do what they claim, which is protect the enterprise.” 
An editor of a national publication replied, when I suggested a particular application was 
built on smoke and mirrors: “Our entire industry is based on smoke and mirrors.” 
Ten years ago Neal Stephenson made this point at CFP about code: Without a 
sociopolitical context, cryptography is not going to protect you. Relying on an 
encryption scheme is like trying to protect your house with a fence consisting of a 
single, very tall picket. (his slide shows a lone picket rising into the sky, a bird 
considering it with bulging eyes.) 
12 
We identify the threats that we can fight, not the threats we cannot fight. 
“cryptography is the opiate of the naive.”  
A noted cryptographer told Peter Neumann that the crypto built into a particular voting 
machine was solid. Neumann acknowledged that but pointed out that the voting machine 
in question was compromised: the system was broken. That’s not my problem, said the 
cryptographer, turning it into what economists call “an externality,” i.e. kicking the 
consequences down the road.. 
Another colleague said: “Security vendors sell “solutions” that address our fears, real or 
imaginary, and tools that can do what they can do and not what they can’t do. AV does 
not stop at least 20%. Once you are owned you are owned.  Making security powerful 
and invisible to the user is not the first imperative.”  
And another said: I remember X laughing at the ATM  and other embedded device code 
he was looking at because it was so simple  and easy to exploit, in my non-expert opinion 
I would say that the cell  phone stuff is even easier.” 
To which another said:   "Mobile device security implementations currently suck more 
ass than the abomination that we call mainstream software."  
AND THIS IS ALL HAPPENING INSIDE THE DARK CAVE  
Where the intelligence community, security-world, and meta-national corporations 
cooperate in behaviors mandated by definitions of success (political, economic, 
social) in which they have become complicit. But what does it have to do with ... 
“security?” 
As one noted: if warrantless tapping of the phone system and internet is OK and can be 
secret, what assurances can Google give us that they aren't the NSA's largest database. 
Why bother with SSL to connect to gmail and google apps when the backend can be 
queried by NSA? 
And warrantless wiretapping of Americans IS ok, according to Gen. Michael Hayden. 
When asked if there might be ethical or legal issues around intercepting the 
communications of Americans without court warrants, Hayden said, no, because “we 
have the power.” 
Building the information systems we have built is permission for using them to do 
whatever they can be used to do, by anyone and everyone, regardless of the 
intention of the builders. Attribution of an attack in cyberspace is child’s play 
compared to attribution of moral and legal responsibility for building a system so 
complex that no one can possibly understand it (see the financial system for another 
example). If everybody does it, then nobody does it. Collusion between 
Murdochians, politicians and police was not a problem until ANOTHER POINT OF 
REFERENCE EMERGED that challenged their collusion. 
13 
Identifying that point of reference is one theme of this presentation. 
Dan Geer: The financial world has proven by 
demonstration that we humans are abundantly capable 
of building systems we can neither then understand 
nor control.  The digital world is insisting on a 
second round of proof.  Just as the greatest enemy 
of our personal health is ubiquitous cheap food, 
the greatest enemy of our national health is 
ubiquitous cheap interconnectivity.   
A senior information practitioner said, after a long discussion years ago with a ranking 
FBI gent: 
   Your choice is not Big Brother or no Big Brother. Your choice is one Big Brother 
or many Little Brothers.  
   Think carefully before you choose. 
Clipper chip was motivated for some as much by a fear of the FBI as it was a means to 
enable panoptic surveillance. And for a reason: COINTELPRO 2.0 is currently in full 
swing. 
Report Prepared by the Electronic Frontier Foundation - January 2011 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
In a review of nearly 2,500 pages of documents released by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation as a result of litigation under the Freedom of Information Act, 
EFF uncovered alarming trends in the Bureau’s intelligence investigation 
practices. The documents consist of reports made by the FBI to the Intelligence 
Oversight Board of violations committed during intelligence investigations from 
2001 to 2008. The documents suggest that FBI intelligence investigations have 
compromised the civil liberties of American citizens far more frequently, and to a 
greater extent, than was previously assumed. In particular, EFF’s analysis 
provides new insight into 
: 
Number of Violations Committed by the FBI 
• From 2001 to 2008, the FBI reported to the IOB approximately 800 violations of 
laws, Executive Orders, or other regulations governing intelligence investigations, 
although this number likely significantly under-represents the number of 
14 
violations that actually occurred. 
• From 2001 to 2008, the FBI investigated, at minimum, 7000 potential violations 
of laws, Executive Orders, or other regulations governing intelligence 
investigations. 
• Based on the proportion of violations reported to the IOB and the FBI’s own 
statements regarding the number of NSL violations that occurred, the actual 
number of possible violations that may have occurred in the nine years since 
9/11 could approach 40,000 violations of law, Executive Order, or other 
regulations governing intelligence investigations 
Substantial Delays in the Intelligence Oversight Process 
• From 2001 to 2008, both FBI and IOB oversight of intelligence activities was 
delayed and likely ineffectual; on average, 2.5 years elapsed between a 
violation’s occurrence and its eventual reporting to the IOB. 
Type and Frequency of FBI Intelligence Violations 
• From 2001 to 2008, of the nearly 800 violations reported to the IOB: 
o over one-third involved FBI violation of rules governing internal 
oversight of intelligence investigations. 
o nearly one-third involved FBI abuse, misuse, or careless use of the 
Bureau’s National Security Letter authority. 
o almost one-fifth involved an FBI violation of the Constitution, the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act, or other laws governing criminal 
investigations or intelligence gathering activities. 
• From 2001 to 2008, in nearly half of all NSL violations, third-parties to whom 
NSLs were issued — phone companies, internet service providers, financial 
institutions, and credit agencies —contributed in some way to the FBI’s 
unauthorized receipt of personal information. 
• From 2001 to 2008, the FBI engaged in a number of flagrant legal violations, 
including: 
o submitting false or inaccurate declarations to courts. 
o using improper evidence to obtain federal grand jury subpoenas. 
o accessing password protected documents without a warrant.

WE ARE NOT ALONE IN FINDING OURSELVES IN THIS KETTLE OF FISH:

The overworld and the underworld ARE the yin yang of reality. The sociologist Emile 
Durkheim’s views on crime were a departure from conventional notions. He believed 
that crime is "bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life and serves 
a social function. He stated that crime implies, "not only that the way remains open to 
necessary change, but that in certain cases it directly proposes these changes... crime [can 
thus be] a useful prelude to reforms." In this sense he saw crime as being able to release 
certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. ... To make 
progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality
