**User:**
I am using Python 3.4 on Windows 8 and I want to convert my Python code into an executable (.exe) file. I have learned that this can be achieved with the `cx_Freeze` library. I installed `cx_Freeze` via the command line using `pip install cx_Freeze`, but it seems not to be working. When I type `cxfreeze` in the command prompt, I receive the following error message:

```
C:\Users\USER>cxfreeze
'cxfreeze' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.
```

I have already added the location of `cxfreeze` to the system's `PATH` environment variable. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

**Assistant:**
I encountered a similar issue while using Python 3.4 (32-bit) on Windows 7 (64-bit). After installing `cx_Freeze`, I noticed that three files were created in the `C:\Python34\Scripts\` directory:

- `cxfreeze`
- `cxfreeze-postinstall`
- `cxfreeze-quickstart`

These files do not have any file extensions, but they are actually Python scripts. To resolve the issue, run the following command from the command prompt:

```sh
python.exe cxfreeze-postinstall
```

This command will generate two batch files in the `C:\Python34\Scripts\` directory:

- `cxfreeze.bat`
- `cxfreeze-quickstart.bat`

Once these batch files are created, you should be able to use `cx_Freeze` without any issues.

In my case, I installed `cx_Freeze` using the provided Windows 32-bit installer (`cx_Freeze-4.3.3.win32-py3.4.exe`). However, installing it with `pip` produced the same result.
