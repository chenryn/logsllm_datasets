by **xuxinhua1984** :
    The code is:(test.go)
    package main
    import "fmt"
    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, World")
    }
    Then, I build it: go build test.go. It is OK.
    But when I delete $GOROOT/src/pkg/fmt directory, then build test.go, it failed:
    cannot find package "fmt" in any of:
        /usr/local/go/src/pkg/fmt (from $GOROOT)
    However, I can build it by 6g and link it by 6l:
       go tool 6g test.go
       go tool 6l test.6
    this will generate 6.out
    Why "go build" depends on $GOROOT/src/pkg ?
