TYPING ACTIVITY DETECTION EXAMPLE
Figures 19 and 20 elucidates the working of our heuristic-
based typing activity detection technique, by means of two real
scenarios that we encountered during our experimentation.

being applied on potential keystrokes, which resulted in a false
positive. Red ticks and lines are for right hand, while blue lines
and ticks are for left hand.
KEYSTROKE PREDICTION TABLES AND FIGURES
APPENDIX F
Between any two consecutive keystrokes using the same
hand, we classify the corresponding arm displacement vector
−−→omi into one of the four intercardinal directions: northeast
(N E), northwest (N W ), southeast (SE), southwest (SW ).
The classiﬁcation of a left hand −−→omi
is conducted as per
−−−−→
conditions listed in Table I. In Table I,
omi(y) are
the x-axis and y-axis displacements (i.e., vector components),
respectively, measured in pixels. The classiﬁcation is isomor-
phic in case of right arm displacements between keystrokes,
as listed in Table II.

Every key on the keyboard occupies a rectangular area,
and a typer can have some variance in the position within
each key where it is pressed. Some keys may be pressed in
the center, while others could be pressed around the edges.
This naturally occurring variance lead us to model the template
inter-keystroke directions more ﬂexibly using nine possible

keyi is the same key as keyj
keyi is in the same row of keyj and keyj is to the
east of keyi
keyi is in the same row of keyj and keyj is to the
west of keyi
keyi is in the row above of keyj and keyj vertically
overlaps the key keyi

overlaps the key keyi
keyi is in the row above of keyj, keyj does not
vertically overlap the key keyi, and keyj is to the

NOISE CHARACTERISTICS
Figure 22 shows the frequency spectrum plots of sample
sounds that were evaluated as background noise. In Figure 22
we can see that the high amplitude frequencies are within a
very narrow band for bird chirps, with periodic patterns. Both
the jackhammer and lawn mower sounds have high amplitude
frequencies more uniformly spread out across their frequency
range and time. Music has a wide range of high and low
amplitude frequencies, but some patterns can be observed over
time. Talking sound has high amplitudes for lower frequencies,
and time-based patterns are not easily identiﬁed. Typing sound
has high amplitudes for a wide band of frequencies, and
sporadic keystrokes can be easily identiﬁed.
