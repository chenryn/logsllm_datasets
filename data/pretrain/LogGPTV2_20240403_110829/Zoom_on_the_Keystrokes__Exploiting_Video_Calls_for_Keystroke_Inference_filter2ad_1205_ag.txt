### TYPING ACTIVITY DETECTION EXAMPLE

Figures 19 and 20 illustrate the functionality of our heuristic-based typing activity detection technique through two real-world scenarios encountered during our experiments.

**Figure 20: Example of Our Typing Activity Detection Heuristics**
- **Description:** This figure shows an instance where our heuristics were applied to potential keystrokes, resulting in a false positive.
- **Color Coding:**
  - Red ticks and lines represent the right hand.
  - Blue ticks and lines represent the left hand.

### KEYSTROKE PREDICTION TABLES AND FIGURES
#### APPENDIX F

For any two consecutive keystrokes using the same hand, we classify the corresponding arm displacement vector \(\overrightarrow{omi}\) into one of four intercardinal directions: northeast (NE), northwest (NW), southeast (SE), and southwest (SW).

**Classification of Left Hand Displacements:**
- The classification is based on the conditions listed in Table I.
- In Table I, \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)}\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)}\) represent the x-axis and y-axis displacements (i.e., vector components), respectively, measured in pixels.

**Table I: Classification of Left Arm Displacements**

| Conditions                        | Direction |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \geq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \geq 0\) | NE        |
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \geq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \leq 0\) | SE        |
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \leq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \geq 0\) | NW        |
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \leq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \leq 0\) | SW        |

**Classification of Right Hand Displacements:**
- The classification for right arm displacements is isomorphic to that of the left arm, as detailed in Table II.

**Table II: Classification of Right Arm Displacements**

| Conditions                        | Direction |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \geq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \geq 0\) | NE        |
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \geq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \leq 0\) | SE        |
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \leq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \geq 0\) | NW        |
| \(\overrightarrow{omi(x)} \leq 0\) and \(\overrightarrow{omi(y)} \leq 0\) | SW        |

### KEYBOARD VARIANCE AND INTER-KEYSTROKE DIRECTIONS

Each key on the keyboard occupies a rectangular area, and there can be some variance in the position within each key where it is pressed. Some keys may be pressed in the center, while others could be pressed around the edges. This natural variance led us to model the template inter-keystroke directions more flexibly using nine possible scenarios between any two keys \(key_i\) and \(key_j\), as detailed in Table III and exemplified in Figure 21.

**Figure 21: Splitting the Keyboard into Two Halves and Template Inter-Keystroke Directions**
- **Description:** This figure illustrates the splitting of the keyboard into two halves and the template inter-keystroke directions following the alphabet 'D'.

**Table III: Mapping of Template Inter-Keystroke Directions**

| Relationship Between \(key_i\) and \(key_j\)                             | Template Direction(s)    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| \(key_i\) is the same key as \(key_j\)                                    | NE, SE, NW, SW          |
| \(key_i\) is in the same row of \(key_j\) and \(key_j\) is to the east of \(key_i\) | NE, SE                  |
| \(key_i\) is in the same row of \(key_j\) and \(key_j\) is to the west of \(key_i\) | NW, SW                  |
| \(key_i\) is in the row above \(key_j\) and \(key_j\) vertically overlaps the key \(key_i\) | NE, NW                 |
| \(key_i\) is in the row below \(key_j\) and \(key_j\) vertically overlaps the key \(key_i\) | SE, SW                 |
| \(key_i\) is in the row above \(key_j\), \(key_j\) does not vertically overlap the key \(key_i\), and \(key_j\) is to the east of \(key_i\) | NE                     |
| \(key_i\) is in the row above \(key_j\), \(key_j\) does not vertically overlap the key \(key_i\), and \(key_j\) is to the west of \(key_i\) | NW                     |
| \(key_i\) is in the row below \(key_j\), \(key_j\) does not vertically overlap the key \(key_i\), and \(key_j\) is to the east of \(key_i\) | SE                     |
| \(key_i\) is in the row below \(key_j\), \(key_j\) does not vertically overlap the key \(key_i\), and \(key_j\) is to the west of \(key_i\) | SW                     |

### NOISE CHARACTERISTICS

**Figure 22: Exemplary Frequency Spectrum Plots of Different Sounds Evaluated as Background Noise**
- **Description:** This figure shows the frequency spectrum plots of sample sounds evaluated as background noise. The audio files were sourced from the AudioSet dataset [3].
- **Observations:**
  - **Bird Chirps:** High amplitude frequencies are within a very narrow band with periodic patterns.
  - **Jackhammer and Lawn Mower:** High amplitude frequencies are more uniformly spread out across their frequency range and time.
  - **Music (Pop/Rock):** A wide range of high and low amplitude frequencies, with observable patterns over time.
  - **Talking (Male):** High amplitudes for lower frequencies, with no easily identifiable time-based patterns.
  - **Typing:** High amplitudes for a wide band of frequencies, with sporadic keystrokes easily identifiable.
