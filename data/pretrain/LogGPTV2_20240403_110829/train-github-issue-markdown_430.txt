by **PI:EMAIL** :
    I just downloaded the source code release branch from code.google.com per the
    instructions, then ran all.bash:
    hg clone ...
    hg update release
    cd go/src
    ./all.bash
    ...
    --- FAIL: TestLookupHost (0.00 seconds)
        hosts_test.go:65: LookupHost("localhost") = [127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1], has duplicate addresses
    FAIL
    FAIL    net 2.379s
    ...
    My /etc/hosts is managed by a config management tool and just happens to have put two
    localhost entries in there (I didn't know this until now ;-)
    cat /etc/hosts
    ...
    127.0.0.1   gunstar localhost
    ...
    127.0.0.1   localhost   
    The test seems a bit fragile because it relies on config outside the control of the Go
    source code.
