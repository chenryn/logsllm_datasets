I recently followed the instructions to download the source code release branch from code.google.com and ran `all.bash`:

```bash
hg clone ...
hg update release
cd go/src
./all.bash
```

During the test execution, I encountered the following failure:

```
--- FAIL: TestLookupHost (0.00 seconds)
    hosts_test.go:65: LookupHost("localhost") = [127.0.0.1 127.0.0.1], has duplicate addresses
FAIL
FAIL    net 2.379s
```

Upon investigation, I discovered that my `/etc/hosts` file, which is managed by a configuration management tool, contains two entries for `localhost`:

```plaintext
127.0.0.1   gunstar localhost
127.0.0.1   localhost
```

This duplication seems to be the cause of the test failure. The test appears to be somewhat fragile because it depends on external configuration settings that are outside the control of the Go source code.
