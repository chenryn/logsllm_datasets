# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
There should be an option to map a shortcut to a key of vice versa.
for example:  
win + h -> left arrow key
This could be used to make a hard to reach key more accessible. For example,
the arrow keys are off in a corner, so I would implement vim style arrow keys
(h is left arrow, j is up, etc . . .). It could also be used to provide access
to a key that isn't on your keyboard.
