### 2.3 Vulnerability Markets

Böhme offers a terminology for the organizational principles of vulnerability markets by comparing bug challenges, vulnerability brokers, exploit derivatives, and cyber-insurance [14]. Algarni and Malaiya analyzed data from several existing vulnerability markets and found that the black market offers significantly higher prices for zero-day vulnerabilities, with government agencies comprising a substantial portion of the buyers [13]. Ozment proposed a vulnerability auction mechanism that enables software companies to assess their software quality based on current bounty levels and to conduct vulnerability discovery at an acceptable cost [30]. This auction model has the potential to be integrated into today's vulnerability discovery ecosystems. A panel discussion at the New Security Paradigms Workshop examined the ethics and implications of vulnerability markets [18]. Kannan and Telang demonstrated that unregulated vulnerability markets often perform worse than regulated ones or even no market at all [24]. They also found that it is socially beneficial to offer rewards to benign vulnerability discoverers.

### 3. METHODOLOGY

#### 3.1 Analysis Overview

Our analysis is organized around three main components: the disclosed vulnerabilities, the white hats, and the involved businesses/organizations. Figure 1 outlines the structure of a representative web vulnerability discovery ecosystem. In the following sections, we describe our data collection efforts.

#### 3.2 Data Collection

We have collected publicly available data from Wooyun and HackerOne. The processed data and related Python scripts can be shared upon request to facilitate the reproduction and extension of our research.

##### 3.2.1 Wooyun

Wooyun, launched in May 2010, is the predominant web vulnerability disclosure program in China. It has attracted 7,744 white hats who have contributed 64,134 vulnerability reports related to 17,328 organizations. In most cases, Wooyun does not offer monetary rewards.

We chose Wooyun as one of our data sources for several reasons. First, Wooyun adheres to a delayed full disclosure policy, which mandates that vulnerabilities are disclosed 45 days after the submission of the report, regardless of whether the organization has addressed the issue. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only platform with such a disclosure policy. We will focus on this aspect in Section 5.1. Second, Wooyun covers the longest period of time and has the largest number of contributions compared to other platforms (Table 1). It includes a large number of organizations from various sectors, as discussed in Section 4.3.3. This is because Wooyun has a very relaxed submission rule: white hats can submit a vulnerability report for almost any organization, and Wooyun will publish it as long as the report is considered valid.

We crawled the vulnerability reports on Wooyun published from May 2010 to early August 2015. For each vulnerability report, we collected the following data fields: (1) white hat’s registration name, (2) target organization, (3) vulnerability type, (4) severity, and (5) submission time. We further explain key data types below.

- **Vulnerability Type**: Each vulnerability report on Wooyun is assigned a type from a predefined list. However, some reports use types not on the list, possibly due to mistakes. We manually corrected these instances and translated the types from Chinese to English, as listed in Figure 5.
- **Severity**: The severity level of a vulnerability reflects its impact on the target organization. There are three levels: high, medium, and low. We primarily use the severity level assigned by the affected organization or by Wooyun. If this information is missing (e.g., when the organization does not respond to the report), we use the severity level provided by the white hat reporter.

We also collected the following additional data:

- **Organization Website URL and Alexa Rank**: To examine the relationship between website popularity and vulnerability discovery, we collected the website’s rank from the Alexa Top Sites service. Since Wooyun does not provide URLs for all organizations, we wrote a script to query the organization’s name on Google and take the first result as the URL. We then retrieved the Alexa rank of all websites from the Alexa Top Sites service. Given that most websites on Wooyun are Chinese, we used the Chinese Alexa rank rather than the global rank.
- **Organization Sector**: We categorized organizations into different sectors based on previous studies [15, 6]. The categorization was initially based on patterns in the organization’s name. For example, universities have names like “XX University” or “University of XX.” After this step, we manually categorized the remaining organizations that received more than 40 vulnerabilities into different sectors.

Our dataset does not include all vulnerabilities discovered by white hats for organizations. First, due to the large volume of vulnerability reports, Wooyun may ignore vulnerabilities deemed irrelevant or of very low importance, such as many reflected XSS vulnerabilities [2]. The impact of this initial expert selection is ambiguous, but we expect that our analysis may benefit from a heightened focus on valuable contributions. Second, white hats are starting to use alternative platforms such as Vulbox, which do not have a public disclosure policy. As Wooyun remains the dominant platform for Chinese website vulnerabilities, we anticipate that the latter effect is relatively small.

##### 3.2.2 HackerOne

HackerOne, a US-based bug bounty platform, was started in November 2013. As of early August 2015, it facilitates 99 public bug bounty programs for global companies such as Yahoo, Mail.ru, and Twitter. Unlike Wooyun, white hats on HackerOne can only submit reports for these specific organizations. HackerOne also hosts invitation-only programs, where eligible white hats must reach a reputation score threshold. Similar platforms, such as BugCrowd, also separate bounty programs into public and invitation-only [12]. Unfortunately, invitation-only programs cannot be accessed publicly, so our dataset only includes public programs.

Our HackerOne dataset includes contributions from 1,653 white hats. An organization can either reward white hats with reputation scores or monetarily compensate them. Unlike Wooyun, HackerOne does not have a delayed public disclosure policy. A vulnerability report can only be disclosed if both the white hat and the organization agree to its publication. Consequently, only a small fraction (732 out of 10,997) of all reports are publicly disclosed. For other reports, we only know limited metadata, including submission times, white hat identifiers, and the names of the affected organizations for each vulnerability. We were able to collect the metadata of 6,876 reports from public bounty programs, constituting 62.5% of all resolved reports. We assume the remainder to be reports for invitation-only programs. Additionally, HackerOne hosts bounty programs for several open-source software projects, such as Perl, Python, and OpenSSL. We excluded 69 reports for these bounty programs since they are not related to web vulnerabilities. Our data includes 3,886 reports with bounties paid during the study period. However, some organizations choose not to disclose the bounty amount; only 1,638 reports have exact monetary payment information. We calculated the average amount of monetary reward paid by an organization, referring to this value as the expected reward.

### 4. RESULTS

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Disclosure Trends

##### 4.1.1 Number of Vulnerabilities

The number of vulnerabilities accepted by the bug bounty platforms provides an initial overview of the productivity of the web vulnerability discovery ecosystems and reflects the time trend of web security. Table 1 shows that each major bug bounty platform has published a large number of vulnerability reports. Figure 2 displays the number of vulnerabilities accepted by Wooyun and HackerOne every month. For Wooyun, the number of vulnerabilities accepted per month continues to grow rapidly over the 5-year span. After an initial growth, the number of vulnerabilities for HackerOne’s public bounty programs stabilizes at around 400 per month. We suspect that including data for invitation-only programs would also result in an upward trend for the HackerOne trajectory.

##### 4.1.2 Severity Levels

We break down the overall vulnerability trend on Wooyun by severity in Figure 3. While the percentage of low-severity vulnerabilities is decreasing, the percentage of published high-severity reports is increasing over time. One known reason is the intentional omission of certain low-severity reports, as discussed in Section 3.2.1. It is also possible that white hats are becoming more skilled in finding severe vulnerabilities over time. Another hypothesis is that low-severity vulnerabilities are easier to discover and thus are usually reported well before more severe problems. Further investigation of these possible causes would be an interesting research question. Overall, the displayed trend indicates that organizations within this ecosystem are still at risk, and more efforts from both the white hat community and the involved organizations are required.

##### 4.1.3 Vulnerability Types

We next examine vulnerability reports on Wooyun according to their types. Figure 4 shows the trend for the top 3 most common vulnerability types. While the percentage of XSS reports is decreasing (possibly due to filtering as mentioned previously), we observe a small relative increase in SQL injection reports. The high amount of XSS is expected for web applications; other platforms, such as BugCrowd, have also reported that XSS is the most common vulnerability type (17.9%) [12]. In contrast, the high amount of SQL injection vulnerabilities on Wooyun is particularly surprising, as SQL injection vulnerabilities are not common on other platforms such as BugCrowd (only 1.3%) [12]. A recent study also reveals that many Chinese websites are generally less secure [15]. However, the observed differences could also be caused by the particular organization participation model of Wooyun, which covers many poorly secured websites. We will discuss this further in Section 5.4.

Figure 5 further shows the number of published reports and the breakdown in severity categories for all vulnerability types on Wooyun. The distribution across vulnerability types is comparable to other sources [12, 1]. We also observe that some types have a larger proportion of high-severity vulnerabilities; for example, SQL injection attacks and malicious file uploads may frequently open up a direct pathway to sensitive data.

In summary, data from bug bounty platforms can be used to meaningfully aggregate valuable security information. Disclosing such information, even at the aggregate level, can help the defense side to update its strategies and allocate resources against different types of threats.

#### 4.2 The White Hat Community

In this section, we first look at the size and growth of the white hat communities on Wooyun and HackerOne. Then, we discuss significant differences regarding productivity and accuracy among white hats using the two datasets. Next, we investigate different skills and strategies of white hats. Finally, we analyze how the disclosure of reports can have positive effects on the white hat community.

##### 4.2.1 Size and Growth

The outcome of a web vulnerability discovery ecosystem is closely related to the size of the white hat community, which is the "supplier" of vulnerability reports. Table 1 shows that these ecosystems have accumulated large white hat communities with tens of thousands of contributors, who may come from all over the world [12, 4]. Later, we will analyze how the size and diversity within the white hat community correlate with vulnerability discovery outcomes.

We first examine how the size of the white hat community changes over time, using two metrics: the number of white hats who reported at least one vulnerability in each month (active white hats) and the number of white hats who submitted their first vulnerability in each month (new white hats). The difference between the number of active white hats and the number of new white hats is the number of repeat contributors. We report these two metrics for Wooyun and HackerOne in Figure 6. For Wooyun, the number of active white hats per month gradually grows to 700 per month. The number of new white hats per month is about 200 in the past 2 years, indicating a relatively constant flow of newcomers joining the ecosystem. The trend for the public programs of HackerOne is similar. In summary, both platforms attract a relatively constant number of white hats who contribute in a given month, while the overall size of the white hat community keeps increasing.

##### 4.2.2 Productivity and Accuracy

While the size of the community matters, we also care about the individual productivity of a white hat, i.e., the number of vulnerabilities found by each white hat. In Figure 7, we plot the distribution of vulnerabilities found by individual white hats on both Wooyun and HackerOne. We observe that the distributions on both platforms are highly skewed. Of the 7,744 white hats on Wooyun, the top 1 has found 521 vulnerabilities, the top 100 have published more than 147 reports per person on average, but 3,725 of the white hats have contributed only once. Similar observations can be made for white hats on HackerOne. Such a long-tail pattern has also been found in other domains, such as scientific productivity [26].

Another important aspect associated with productivity is accuracy. Many existing public bounty programs have complained about the low signal-to-noise ratio and the effort required to deal with a large amount of invalid reports, which generally include duplications, non-security issues, out-of-scope, false positives, or even spam [12, 9, 4, 8]. The signal-to-noise ratio is roughly 20% for platforms such as HackerOne and BugCrowd, and even lower for individually hosted bounty programs by Facebook and GitHub [12, 8]. In addition, HackerOne has reported that, in general, more productive researchers have a higher signal-to-noise ratio [8].
