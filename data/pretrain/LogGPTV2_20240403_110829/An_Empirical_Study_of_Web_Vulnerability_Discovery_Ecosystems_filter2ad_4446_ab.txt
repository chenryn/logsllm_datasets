rather than sophisticated automated vulnerability discovery
tools [13, 19]. Zhao et al. conducted an initial exploratory
study of white hats on Wooyun [38] and uncovered the di-
versity of white hat behaviors on productivity, vulnerability
type specialization, and discovery transitions.
2.3 Vulnerability Markets
B¨ohme oﬀers a terminology for organizational principles of
vulnerability markets by comparing bug challenges, vulner-
ability brokers, exploit derivatives and cyber-insurance [14].
Algarni and Malaiya analyzed data of several existing vul-
nerability markets and showed that the black market oﬀers
much higher price for zero-day vulnerabilities, and govern-
ment agencies make up a signiﬁcant portion of the buy-
ers [13]. Ozment proposed a vulnerability auction mecha-
nism that allows a software company to measure its soft-
ware quality based on the current bounty level, and to con-
duct vulnerability discovery at an acceptable cost [30]. This
auction model can potentially be incorporated into today’s
vulnerability discovery ecosystems. A panel discussion at
the New Security Paradigms Workshop examined ethics and
implications for vulnerability markets [18]. Finally, Kannan
and Telang showed that unregulated vulnerability markets
almost always perform worse than regulated ones, or even
no market at all [24]. They also found that it is socially ben-
eﬁcial to oﬀer rewards for benign vulnerability discoverers.
3. METHODOLOGY
3.1 Analysis Overview
We organize our analysis around three components: the
vulnerabilities disclosed, the white hats, and the involved
businesses/organizations. Figure 1 outlines the structure of
Figure 1: Structure of a web vulnerability discovery ecosys-
tem.
a representative web vulnerability discovery ecosystem. In
the following, we describe our data collection eﬀorts.
3.2 Data Collection
We have collected publicly available data from Wooyun
and HackerOne. The processed data and related Python
scripts can be shared upon request in order to reproduce
and extend our research.
3.2.1 Wooyun
Wooyun is the predominant web vulnerability disclosure
program in China launched in May 2010. It has attracted
7,744 white hats who contributed 64,134 vulnerability re-
ports related to 17,328 organizations. In most cases, Wooyun
does not oﬀer monetary rewards.
We choose Wooyun as one of the data sources for our study
for several reasons. First, Wooyun insists on a delayed full
disclosure policy, which states that the vulnerability will be
disclosed 45 days after the submission of the report, irre-
spective of whether the organization has addressed the issue
or not. To the best of our knowledge, it is the only plat-
form that has such a disclosure policy. We will focus on this
aspect in Section 5.1. Second, Wooyun covers the longest
period of time and the largest number of contributions com-
pared with other platforms (Table 1). It also includes a large
number of organizations from several diﬀerent sectors, as we
will discuss in Section 4.3.3. This is because Wooyun has a
very relaxed submission rule compared with other US-based
platforms: white hats can submit a vulnerability report to
Wooyun for almost any organization, and Wooyun will pub-
lish it as long as the report is considered valid.
We crawled the vulnerability reports on Wooyun pub-
lished from May 2010 to early August 2015. For each vul-
nerability report, we collected the following data ﬁelds: (1)
white hat’s registration name, (2) target organization, (3)
vulnerability type, (4) severity and (5) submission time. We
further explain key data types below.
Vulnerability type: Each vulnerability report on Wooyun
has a vulnerability type from a predeﬁned list. However, we
also observe that for some reports, the vulnerability types
used are not in the list, possibly due to mistakes. We manu-
ally corrected these instances. We also translated the types
from Chinese into English and list them in Figure 5.
Severity: The severity level of a vulnerability reﬂects its
impact on the target organization. There are three levels:
high, medium and low. We mainly use the severity level as-
signed by the aﬀected organization or by the Wooyun plat-
Stockpiled Vulnerabilities Black Hats Public Bug Bounty Platform Organizations White Hats Disclosed Vulnerabilities Respond & Reward Submit Vulnerability Reports Reduce Learn Discover and Exploit Vulnerabilities Personal Data Security Assessment form. If this information is missing (e.g., when the organiza-
tion does not respond to the report), we will use the severity
level provided by the white hat reporter.
We have also collected the following data:
Organization website’s URL and Alexa rank : To examine
whether a website’s popularity is related to vulnerability dis-
covery, we collected the website’s rank from the Alexa Top
Sites service. Since Wooyun does not provide the URL for
all organizations, we wrote a script that queries the orga-
nization’s name on Google and takes the ﬁrst result as the
URL. We then retrieved the Alexa rank of all websites from
the Alexa Top Sites service. Since most websites on Wooyun
are Chinese, we use the Chinese Alexa rank, rather than the
global rank.
Organization sector : We also categorized organizations
into diﬀerent sectors. The deﬁnition of sectors are based
on previous studies [15, 6]. The categorization is initially
based on patterns in the organization’s name. For example,
universities have names like “XX university” or “university
of XX”. After this step, we further manually categorized the
remaining organizations that have received more than 40
vulnerabilities into diﬀerent sectors.
Our dataset cannot contain all vulnerabilities discovered
by white hats for organizations. First, due to the large vol-
ume of vulnerability reports received, Wooyun may ignore
vulnerabilities that are considered irrelevant or of very low
importance, such as many reﬂected XSS vulnerabilities [2].
The impact of this initial expert selection is ambiguous, but
we expect that our analysis may beneﬁt from a heightened
focus on valuable contributions. Second, white hats are
starting to use alternative platforms such as Vulbox which
do not have a public disclosure policy. As Wooyun remains
the dominant platform for Chinese website vulnerabilities,
we anticipate that the latter eﬀect is relatively small.
3.2.2 HackerOne
HackerOne is a US-based bug bounty platform started in
November 2013. As of early August 2015, it facilitates 99
public bug bounty programs for global companies such as
Yahoo, Mail.ru and Twitter. Unlike Wooyun, white hats on
HackerOne can only submit reports for these organizations.
HackerOne also hosts invitation-only programs. To be eligi-
ble white hats must reach a reputation score threshold. Sim-
ilar programs, such as BugCrowd also separate bounty pro-
grams into public and invitation-only [12]. Unfortunately,
invitation-only programs cannot be accessed publicly, so our
dataset only includes public programs.
Our HackerOne dataset includes contributions from 1,653
white hats. An organization can either reward white hats
with reputation scores or monetarily compensate them. Un-
like Wooyun, HackerOne does not have a delayed public
disclosure policy. A vulnerability report can only be dis-
closed if both the white hat and the organization commit
to its publication. As a result, only a small fraction (732 of
10,997) of all reports are publicly disclosed. For other re-
ports, we only know limited metadata, including submission
times, white hat identiﬁers, and the names of the aﬀected
organizations for each vulnerability. We are able to collect
the metadata of 6,876 reports from public bounty programs
in total. They constitute 62.5% of all resolved reports. We
assume the remainder to be reports for invitation-only pro-
grams. In addition, HackerOne hosts bounty programs for
several open source software projects, such as Perl, Python,
OpenSSL. We exclude 69 reports for these bounty programs
since they are not related to web vulnerabilities. Our data
includes 3,886 reports with bounties paid during the study
period. However, some organizations choose not to disclose
the bounty amount; i.e., only 1,638 reports have exact mone-
tary payment information. We calculate the average amount
of monetary reward paid by an organization, and refer to this
value as the expected reward.
4. RESULTS
4.1 Vulnerability Disclosure Trends
Severity Levels
We ﬁrst provide an overview of the disclosed vulnerabil-
ities. Since the HackerOne dataset does not include data
about the vulnerability type and severity, we will mainly
focus on the Wooyun dataset.
4.1.1 Number of Vulnerabilities
The number of vulnerabilities accepted by the bug bounty
platforms provides an initial overview of the productivity
of the web vulnerability discovery ecosystems, and also re-
ﬂects the time trend of web security. Table 1 shows that
each of the major bug bounty platforms has published a
large number of vulnerability reports. Figure 2 further dis-
plays the number of vulnerabilities accepted by Wooyun and
HackerOne every month. For Wooyun, the number of vul-
nerabilities accepted per month continues to grow rapidly
in the 5-year span. After an initial growth, the number of
vulnerabilities for HackerOne’s public bounty programs is
relatively stable at around 400 per month. We suspect that
an inclusion of data for invitation-only programs would also
result in an upward trend for the HackerOne trajectory.
4.1.2
We break down the overall vulnerability trend on Wooyun
by severity in Figure 3. While the percentage of low sever-
ity vulnerabilities is decreasing, the percentage of published
high severity reports is increasing over time. One known
reason is the intentional omission of certain low severity
reports, as we have discussed in Section 3.2.1.
It is also
possible that white hats are becoming more skilled in ﬁnd-
ing severe vulnerabilities over time. Another hypothesis is
that low severity vulnerabilities are easier to discover and
thus are usually reported well before more severe problems.
Further investigation of these possible causes would be an
interesting research question. Overall, the displayed trend
indicates that organizations inside this ecosystem are still at
risk, and more eﬀorts from both the white hat community
and the involved organizations are required.
4.1.3 Vulnerability Types
We next examine vulnerability reports on Wooyun accord-
ing to their types. Figure 4 shows the trend for the top 3
most common vulnerability types. While the percentage of
XSS reports is decreasing (possibly due to ﬁltering as men-
tioned previously), we observe a small relative increase of
SQL injection reports. The high amount of XSS is expected
for web applications; other platforms, such as BugCrowd,
have also reported that XSS is the most common vulner-
ability type (17.9%) [12]. In contrast, the high amount of
SQL injection vulnerabilities on Wooyun is particularly sur-
prising, since SQL injection vulnerabilities are not common
on other platforms such as BugCrowd (only 1.3%) [12]. A

recent study also reveals that many Chinese websites are
generally less secure [15]. However, the observed diﬀerences
could also be caused by the particular organization partici-
pation model of Wooyun, which is able to cover much more
poorly secured websites. We will discuss more on this in
Section 5.4.
Figure 5: Number of reports for each vulnerability type on
Wooyun (log scale). The compact visualization uses three
colors to represent the percentage of three severity levels.
Note that percentages are not aﬀected by the log scale.
Types in bold font also appear in OWASP’s 2013 top 10 [1].
Figure 5 further shows the number of published reports,
and the breakdown in severity categories for all vulnerabil-
ity types on Wooyun. The distribution across vulnerability
types is comparable to other sources [12, 1]. We also observe
that some types have a larger proportion of high severity
vulnerabilities; for example, SQL injection attacks and ma-
licious ﬁle uploads may frequently open up a direct pathway
to sensitive data.
In summary, data from bug bounty platforms can be used
to meaningfully aggregate valuable security information. Dis-
closing such information, even at the aggregate level, can
help the defense side to update its strategies and to allocate
resources against diﬀerent types of threats.
4.2 The White Hat Community
In this section, we ﬁrst look at the size and growth of the
white hat communities on Wooyun and HackerOne. Then,
we discuss signiﬁcant diﬀerences regarding productivity and
accuracy among white hats using the two datasets. Next, we
investigate diﬀerent skills and strategies of white hats. Fi-
nally, we analyze how disclosure of reports can have positive
eﬀects on the white hat community.
Size and Growth
4.2.1
The outcome of a web vulnerability discovery ecosystem is
closely related to the size of the white hat community, who
is the “supplier” of vulnerability reports. Table 1 shows that
these ecosystems have accumulated large white hat commu-
nities with tens of thousands of contributors, who may come
from all over the world [12, 4]. Later, we will analyze how
the size and the diversity within the white hat community
correlate with vulnerability discovery outcomes.
We ﬁrst examine how the size of the white hat community
changes over time, using two metrics: the number of white
hats who reported at least one vulnerability in each month
(active white hats), and the number of white hats who sub-
mitted their ﬁrst vulnerability in each month (new white
hats). The diﬀerence between the number of active white
hats and the number of new white hats is the number of re-
peat contributors. We report these two metrics for Wooyun
and HackerOne in Figure 6. For Wooyun, the number of ac-
tive white hats per month gradually grows to 700 per month.
The number of new white hats per month is about 200 in the
past 2 years, which means that there is a relatively constant
ﬂow of newcomers joining the ecosystem. The trend for the
public programs of HackerOne is similar. In summary, both
platforms attract a relatively constant number of white hats
who contribute in a given month, while the overall size of
the white hat community keeps increasing.
4.2.2 Productivity and Accuracy
While the size of the community matters, we also care
about the individual productivity of a white hat, i.e., the
number of vulnerabilities found by each white hat. In Fig-
ure 7, we plot the distribution of vulnerabilities found by
individual white hats on both Wooyun and HackerOne. We
observe that the distributions on both platforms are very
skewed. Of 7,744 white hats on Wooyun, the top 1 has
found 521 vulnerabilities, the top 100 have published more
than 147 reports per person on average, but 3725 of the
white hats have contributed only once. Similar observations
can be made for white hats on HackerOne. Such long-tail
pattern has also been found in other domains, such as sci-
entiﬁc productivity [26].

Another important aspect associated with productivity
is accuracy. Many existing public bounty programs have
complained about the low signal-to-noise ratio and the ef-
fort required to deal with a large amount of invalid re-
ports, which generally include duplications, non-security is-
sues, out-of-scope, false positives, or even spam [12, 9, 4, 8].
The signal-to-noise ratio is roughly 20% for platforms such
as HackerOne and BugCrowd, and even lower for individu-
ally hosted bounty programs by Facebook and Github [12,
8]. In addition, HackerOne has reported that in general more
productive researchers have a higher signal-to-noise ratio [8].
