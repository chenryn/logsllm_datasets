### Analysis of DNS Response Flags and Codes

#### 1. Authoritative Answer (AA) Flag
- **Definition**: The AA flag in a DNS response indicates that the server responding to the query is the authoritative name server for the given domain.
- **Probing Setup**: In our experiment, we sent DNS queries for all IPv4 addresses, and we were the sole owner of the second-level domain (SLD), `ucfsealresearch.net`.
- **Observations**:
  - **2013 Data**:
    - Out of all R2 responses, 381,124 (approximately 2.29% of total responses) had the AA bit set to 1.
    - Among these, 231,368 responses contained a `dns_answer` field, with 78,279 (about 20.53%) providing incorrect results.
  - **2018 Data**:
    - 249,193 R2 responses had the AA bit set to 1, which is less than 4% of the total responses.
    - Of these, 119,147 responses contained a `dns_answer` field, with 94,052 (about 79%) providing incorrect information.
- **Comparison**:
  - The number of R2 responses with AA bit set to 0 decreased from 16 million to 6 million between 2013 and 2018.
  - The number of R2 responses with AA bit set to 1 decreased from 381,124 to 249,193 (a reduction of about 61%).
  - Despite this decrease, the error rate for responses with AA bit set to 1 increased significantly, from 20.53% in 2013 to 79% in 2018.

#### 2. Response Code (RCODE)
- **Definition**: The RCODE in a DNS response provides metadata about the outcome of the resolution. Common values include:
  - 0: NoError
  - 1: FormErr
  - 2: ServFail
  - 3: NXDomain
  - 4: NotImp
  - 5: Refused
  - 6: YXDomain
  - 7: YXRRSet
  - 8: NXRRSet
  - 9: NotAuth
- **Observations**:
  - **General Trend**: Most responses containing a `dns_answer` field had an RCODE of 0 (NoError). Responses without a `dns_answer` field typically had a non-zero RCODE.
  - **Abnormal Combinations**:
    - 14,005 R2 packets had a non-zero (error) RCODE despite containing a `dns_answer` field.
    - 1,198,772 R2 packets without a `dns_answer` field had an RCODE of 0 (NoError).
  - **2018 Data**:
    - 2,715 R2 packets had a non-zero RCODE even with a `dns_answer` field.
    - Specific counts: 23 R2s with RCODE 1, 2,489 with RCODE 2, 10 with RCODE 3, and 193 with RCODE 5.
    - 377,803 responses with RCODE 0 had no `dns_answer` field.
- **Trends**:
  - The number of packets with most RCODEs decreased (e.g., NoError, FormErr, ServFail, NXDomain, and Refused).
  - However, the number of responses with RCODEs 1 (NotImp) and 9 (NotAuth) increased significantly, while those with RCODEs 6 (YXDomain) and 7 (YXRRSet) remained stable.

#### 3. DNS Responses with Empty `dns_question` Field
- **Overview**: We analyzed 494 R2 packets from 2018 that lacked a `dns_question` field.
- **Findings**:
  - 19 R2 packets (about 3.8%) contained a `dns_answer` field, but none provided the correct answer.
  - 14 packets contained private network addresses (13 for 192.168.0.0/16, 1 for 10.0.0.0/8).

#### 4. Incorrect DNS Answers
- **Summary**:
  - **2013 Data**: 121,293 out of 16,660,123 R2 packets provided incorrect answers.
  - **2018 Data**: 110,093 out of 6,506,258 R2 packets provided incorrect answers.
- **Categorization**:
  - **IP Address**: 112,270 (2013) and 110,790 (2018) R2 packets had incorrect IP addresses.
  - **URL**: 249 (2013) and 231 (2018) R2 packets had incorrect URLs.
  - **String**: 10 (2013) and 72 (2018) R2 packets contained abnormal strings like "wild", "ff", "OK", etc.
- **Top 10 Analysis**:
  - The most frequently observed incorrect IP address appeared in 23,692 responses, associated with a domain and web hosting company.
  - The top 10 incorrect IP addresses accounted for about half of all incorrect R2 responses (50,669 out of 111,093).
  - Four of the top 10 addresses were private networks (belonging to 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16).

#### 5. Caveats
- **Data Collection**: In 2013, we used a C-based system to collect data and store it in a `.pcap` file. During parsing, some `dns_answer` fields were not decoded correctly, affecting 8,764 packets (about 0.05% of the total).

This analysis highlights the importance of ensuring the reliability and accuracy of DNS responses, especially from open resolvers, and underscores the need for continuous monitoring and improvement in DNS infrastructure.
