Abstract
1 Introduction
The growing popularity of wireless networks and mo-
bile devices is starting to attract unwanted attention
especially as potential targets for malicious activities
reach critical mass.
In this study, we try to quantify
the threat from large-scale distributed attacks on wireless
networks, and, more speciﬁcally, wiﬁ networks in densely
populated metropolitan areas. We focus on three likely
attack scenarios: “wildﬁre” worms that can spread con-
tagiously over and across wireless LANs, coordinated
citywide phishing campaigns based on wireless spooﬁng,
and rogue systems for compromising location privacy in
a coordinated fashion. The ﬁrst attack illustrates how
dense wiﬁ deployment may provide opportunities for at-
tackers who want to quickly compromise large numbers
of machines. The last two attacks illustrate how botnets
can amplify wiﬁ vulnerabilities, and how botnet power is
ampliﬁed by wireless connectivity.
To quantify these threats, we rely on real-world data
extracted from wiﬁ maps of large metropolitan areas in
the States and Singapore. Our results suggest that a care-
fully crafted wireless worm can infect up to 80% of all
wiﬁ connected hosts in some metropolitan areas within
20 minutes, and that an attacker can launch phishing at-
tacks or build a tracking system to monitor the location
of 10-50% of wireless users in these metropolitan areas
with just 1,000 zombies under his control.

The last two decades of network security research have
demonstrated that attackers are continuously evolving,
exploring creative ways to exploit systems, and targeting
new technologies and services as they emerge. Indeed,
the widespread use of email brought spam and email-
viruses; broadband connectivity was followed by the rise
of rapid self-propagating worms; while the growing use
of online personal services and electronic commerce re-
sulted in sophisticated personal data theft attacks, includ-
ing phishing. Such trends suggest that any technology
that reaches some kind of critical mass will attract the
attention of attackers.
At the same time, modern attacks such as worms,
spam, and phishing exploit gaps in traditional threat
models that usually revolve around preventing unau-
thorized access and information disclosure. The new
threat landscape requires security researchers to consider
a wider range of attacks: opportunistic attacks in addi-
tion to targeted ones; attacks coming not just from ma-
licious users, but also from subverted (yet otherwise be-
nign) hosts; coordinated/distributed attacks in addition
to isolated, single-source methods; and attacks blending
ﬂaws across layers, rather than exploiting a single vul-
nerability. Some of the largest security lapses in the last
decade are due to designers ignoring the complexity of
the threat landscape.
The increasing penetration of wireless networking,
and more speciﬁcally wiﬁ, may soon reach critical mass,
making it necessary to examine whether the current state
of wireless security is adequate for fending off likely
attacks. This paper discusses three types of threats

that seem insufﬁciently addressed by existing technol-
ogy and deployment techniques. The ﬁrst threat is wild-
ﬁre worms, a class of worms that spreads contagiously
between hosts on neighboring APs. We show that such
worms can spread to a large fraction of hosts in a dense
urban setting, and that the propagation speed can be such
that most existing defenses cannot react in a timely fash-
ion. Worse, such worms can penetrate through networks
protected by WEP and other security mechanisms. The
second threat we discuss is large-scale spooﬁng attacks
that can be used for massive phishing and spam cam-
paigns. We show how an attacker can easily use a bot-
net by acquiring access to wiﬁ-capable zombie hosts, and
can use these zombies to target not just the local wireless
LAN, but any LAN within range, greatly increasing his
reach across heterogeneous networks. Last but not least,
we discuss the use of Tracknets, city-wide wiﬁ botnets
for unauthorized tracking of user location and behavior.

are speciﬁc to wireless networks, and are based on the
premise of dense wiﬁ network deployment in urban set-
tings. While most of the underlying vulnerabilities have
been widely known for years, the amplifying power of
densely deployed wiﬁ networking has a profound impact
on both the feasibility and the magnitude of the threats,
suggesting that their importance may have been grossly
underestimated. For instance, the susceptibility of open
wireless LANs to spooﬁng has been well documented,
but the need to be in physical proximity to the victim
may have deterred the wider use of this attack so far. The
ability to launch such attacks remotely is much more at-
tractive, and can be scaled up by the use of coordination
and a botnet infrastructure.
All three types of attacks,
As a result of underestimating these threats, no coun-
termeasures are currently implemented. The mecha-
nisms needed to thwart these attacks are in most cases
either available but not actively used, or not available but
relatively easy to implement. The fact that such mecha-
nisms are not used is of particular concern. For instance,
802.11i security mechanisms have been available for sev-
eral years, and would address a large part of the problems
described, but unfortunately they are currently not used
by enough users. Similarly, the encryption of of MAC
addresses would signiﬁcantly increase the work-factor
for Tracknets, but leaving the MAC addresses exposed
was not deemed as a serious enough problem by the
802.11i group. Related to the worm problem, content-
based ﬁltering is widely used and intrusion prevention
is a mature technology, yet to the best of our knowl-
edge, it has not been employed in access point wireless-
to-wireless forwarding Raising awareness on the threats,
using convincing, experimental evidence, is therefore at
least as important as exploring and implementing possi-
ble defenses.
The main focus of this paper is in quantifying these
threats, speciﬁcally in metro-area wireless networks. We
rely primarily on publicly available maps of wireless ac-
cess point locations, also known as wardriving maps, and
attempt to derive estimates on the feasibility and effec-
tiveness of the attacks using measurements and simula-
tions. These estimates paint a grim picture on the ex-
posure of current wireless networks to such attacks, and
indicate that the risks are further increased as wireless
penetration continues to grow as predicted.
We also explore possible remediation strategies, most
of which we have implemented and tested experimen-
tally. In some cases, the defenses we have considered
are just a matter of engineering, such as retroﬁtting re-
active worm defense hooks and ﬁltering capabilities in
wiﬁ gear. In other cases, countering the threat required
novel techniques, such as those for detecting and pre-
venting different variants of the basic spooﬁng attack –
several such variants were discovered while pondering
about possible defenses, and how attackers might try to
circumvent them.
While some of these techniques would become redun-
dant if 802.11i is widely deployed, we cannot rest on the
assumption that such deployment will happen anytime
soon, particularly in light of usability concerns. For ex-
ample, none of the recently announced municipal wire-
less initiatives that we are aware of employ any form of
protection, most likely due to the current perception of
the risks of open wireless as well as the cost of managing
accounts and passwords for large number of users – in
one instance, 100,000 users and around 9M annual visi-
tors. Furthermore, the choice of running an open wireless
network may not always be a matter of ignorance or com-
placency, but a concious choice; for example, to provide
network access to guests, backup connectivity to neigh-
bors, etc [26]. Whether temporary or long-term, we be-
lieve that our supplementary defense techniques are use-
ful for mitigating at least part of the threat.
2 Wildﬁre worms
The omnipresence and constantly improving capabili-
ties of wireless mobile devices has attracted the regret-
table attention of attackers, and in particular virus writ-
ers. The “Cabir” virus, which ﬁrst appeared in 2004, was
the ﬁrst instance of mobile malware [27]. The virus ex-
ploited vulnerabilities in the Symbian OS and propagated
through Bluetooth wireless connections. Experts predict
the threat for smart phones and mobile devices is likely
to increase signiﬁcantly in the near future [40, 28].
Although such attacks may become prevalent in the
years to come, in this paper we consider whether large-
scale attacks are already feasible today on existing wire-
less infrastructure using current technology. In particu-
lar, we focus on worms that could spread entirely over

if such a wireless worm were to be unleashed today, it
would most likely go undetected by most, if not all, cur-
rent attack detection infrastructures [17, 2, 3]. Finally,
devices (e.g. handheld devices in the near future) in
these environments are likely to be signiﬁcantly more
resource-constrained, at least in contrast to traditional
desktop settings, and it is therefore more difﬁcult and ex-
pensive to employ end-point security measures.
802.11 wireless networks, even if such networks are
completely heterogeneous. In this environment, the main
concern is not necessarily the infection of mobile devices
such as PDAs and cell phones, but the existing large pop-
ulation of laptops, desktops and other computers com-
municating over wiﬁ. We consider worms that propa-
gate entirely over wireless connections, trying to infect
other computers tuned to the same access point (AP) and
also other APs within range. A notable fraction of hosts
in such an environment may also be mobile, and could
therefore carry the infection from one AP to another.
In densely populated metropolitan areas, it is conceiv-
able that such a worm could infect a large fraction of
wireless-connected hosts, especially considering perva-
sive vulnerabilities such as the ones exploited by Slam-
mer [12], and recent browser vulnerabilities [13]. Such
“client-side” vulnerabilities are of particular interest in
a wiﬁ setting, because unlike wired environments where
a user needs to visit a malicious site to get exploited, it
is often possible for an infected client to inject this kind
of exploit via spooﬁng to any session between the target
and a legitimate server. Considering the worst-case, a
device driver exploit such as the recently discovered In-
tel driver attack [24, 36, 42] could carry the worm across
platforms, and would even bypass VPN software which
often blocks all local, wireless connections.
Although there has been considerable work in the lit-
erature on how to deal with large-scale attacks on tradi-
tional “wired” networks, there are at least three differ-
ences between wireless networks that require alternative
solutions. First, wireless attacks can spread contagiously
over wireless links based on proximity – similarly to real-
world diseases – in contrast to the any-to-any communi-
cation possible over the Internet. This renders previous
models and analyses of Internet-based worm propagation
ineffectual as they cannot be directly mapped to wire-
less networks. Second, trafﬁc in wireless networks is
difﬁcult to control using conventional methods, in lack
of “hard” enforcement points such as ﬁrewalls between
the communicating nodes. This is likely to signiﬁcantly
constrain the space for potential defenses. For instance,
the ﬁrst
This paper is not
to examine the threat
of worms in wireless networks. Other researchers
have made attempts at deriving contagion models in
MANETs, examining viruses that spread according to
user mobility, or measuring propagation dynamics in a
campus network (these studies are discussed further in
Section 6). Our paper is ﬁrst to explore, in depth, the
problem of wildﬁre worms and proximity propagation
in densely populated areas. Speciﬁcally, we discuss the
threat of worms that propagate entirely over wiﬁ connec-
tions, and attempt to quantify the threat in terms of infec-
tion prevalence and infection timescales. Providing reli-
able estimates of potential infection prevalence is impor-
tant for creating awareness on the severity of the threat,
while the likely infection times are needed to guide the
design of suitable countermeasures. Our analysis relies
on simulated outbreaks of wiﬁ worms driven by real-
world data derived from wiﬁ maps of large metropolitan
areas around the world. Among other observations, our
results suggest that a carefully crafted wildﬁre worm can
infect all vulnerable wiﬁ-connected computers in 80%
of access points in some studied areas within 10-20 min-
utes – timescales at which traditional defenses may not
be able to react in a timely fashion.
In this section, we describe the design and attack vec-
tors of a wiﬁ worm. The fundamental principle is that a
wildﬁre worm relies on local, proximity-based propaga-
tion within shared medium broadcast environment such
as WLAN.
