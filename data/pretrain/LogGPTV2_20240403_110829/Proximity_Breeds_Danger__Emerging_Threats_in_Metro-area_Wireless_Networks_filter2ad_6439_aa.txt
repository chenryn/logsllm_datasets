## Abstract

The growing popularity of wireless networks and mobile devices is attracting unwanted attention, particularly as potential targets for malicious activities reach critical mass. This study aims to quantify the threat from large-scale distributed attacks on wireless networks, focusing on Wi-Fi networks in densely populated metropolitan areas. We examine three likely attack scenarios: "wildfire" worms that spread contagiously over and across wireless LANs, coordinated citywide phishing campaigns based on wireless spoofing, and rogue systems for compromising location privacy in a coordinated fashion. The first attack highlights how dense Wi-Fi deployment can provide opportunities for attackers to quickly compromise large numbers of machines. The latter two attacks illustrate how botnets can amplify Wi-Fi vulnerabilities and how botnet power is amplified by wireless connectivity.

To quantify these threats, we use real-world data extracted from Wi-Fi maps of large metropolitan areas in the United States and Singapore. Our results suggest that a carefully crafted wireless worm can infect up to 80% of all Wi-Fi connected hosts in some metropolitan areas within 20 minutes. Additionally, an attacker can launch phishing attacks or build a tracking system to monitor the location of 10-50% of wireless users in these areas with just 1,000 zombies under their control.

## 1. Introduction

Over the past two decades, network security research has shown that attackers continuously evolve, exploring creative ways to exploit systems and targeting new technologies and services as they emerge. For example, the widespread use of email brought spam and email viruses; broadband connectivity led to the rise of rapid self-propagating worms; and the growing use of online personal services and electronic commerce resulted in sophisticated personal data theft attacks, including phishing. These trends suggest that any technology that reaches a critical mass will attract the attention of attackers.

Modern attacks such as worms, spam, and phishing exploit gaps in traditional threat models, which typically focus on preventing unauthorized access and information disclosure. The new threat landscape requires security researchers to consider a wider range of attacks, including opportunistic and targeted attacks, attacks from subverted (yet otherwise benign) hosts, coordinated/distributed attacks, and attacks blending flaws across layers. Some of the largest security lapses in recent years are due to designers ignoring the complexity of the threat landscape.

The increasing penetration of wireless networking, and more specifically Wi-Fi, may soon reach critical mass, making it necessary to examine whether the current state of wireless security is adequate for fending off likely attacks. This paper discusses three types of threats that seem insufficiently addressed by existing technology and deployment techniques:

1. **Wildfire Worms:** A class of worms that spreads contagiously between hosts on neighboring Access Points (APs). Such worms can spread to a large fraction of hosts in a dense urban setting, and the propagation speed can be so fast that most existing defenses cannot react in a timely fashion. Moreover, these worms can penetrate through networks protected by WEP and other security mechanisms.
2. **Large-Scale Spoofing Attacks:** These can be used for massive phishing and spam campaigns. An attacker can easily use a botnet by acquiring access to Wi-Fi-capable zombie hosts and can target not just the local wireless LAN but any LAN within range, greatly increasing their reach across heterogeneous networks.
3. **Tracknets:** City-wide Wi-Fi botnets for unauthorized tracking of user location and behavior. The amplifying power of densely deployed Wi-Fi networking has a profound impact on both the feasibility and magnitude of these threats, suggesting that their importance may have been grossly underestimated.

All three types of attacks are specific to wireless networks and are based on the premise of dense Wi-Fi network deployment in urban settings. While most of the underlying vulnerabilities have been known for years, the amplifying power of densely deployed Wi-Fi networking has a profound impact on both the feasibility and the magnitude of the threats.

As a result of underestimating these threats, no countermeasures are currently implemented. The mechanisms needed to thwart these attacks are either available but not actively used or not available but relatively easy to implement. For instance, 802.11i security mechanisms have been available for several years and would address a large part of the problems described, but they are currently not used by enough users. Similarly, encrypting MAC addresses would significantly increase the work-factor for Tracknets, but leaving the MAC addresses exposed was not deemed a serious enough problem by the 802.11i group.

The main focus of this paper is to quantify these threats, specifically in metro-area wireless networks. We rely primarily on publicly available maps of wireless access point locations, also known as wardriving maps, and attempt to derive estimates on the feasibility and effectiveness of the attacks using measurements and simulations. These estimates paint a grim picture of the exposure of current wireless networks to such attacks and indicate that the risks are further increased as wireless penetration continues to grow.

We also explore possible remediation strategies, many of which we have implemented and tested experimentally. In some cases, the defenses we have considered are just a matter of engineering, such as retrofitting reactive worm defense hooks and filtering capabilities in Wi-Fi gear. In other cases, countering the threat required novel techniques, such as those for detecting and preventing different variants of the basic spoofing attack.

While some of these techniques would become redundant if 802.11i is widely deployed, we cannot rest on the assumption that such deployment will happen anytime soon, particularly in light of usability concerns. For example, none of the recently announced municipal wireless initiatives that we are aware of employ any form of protection, most likely due to the current perception of the risks of open wireless and the cost of managing accounts and passwords for a large number of users. Furthermore, the choice of running an open wireless network may not always be a matter of ignorance or complacency but a conscious choice, such as providing network access to guests or backup connectivity to neighbors. Whether temporary or long-term, we believe that our supplementary defense techniques are useful for mitigating at least part of the threat.

## 2. Wildfire Worms

The omnipresence and constantly improving capabilities of wireless mobile devices have attracted the regrettable attention of attackers, particularly virus writers. The "Cabir" virus, which first appeared in 2004, was the first instance of mobile malware. The virus exploited vulnerabilities in the Symbian OS and propagated through Bluetooth wireless connections. Experts predict that the threat for smartphones and mobile devices is likely to increase significantly in the near future.

Although such attacks may become prevalent in the years to come, in this paper, we consider whether large-scale attacks are already feasible today on existing wireless infrastructure using current technology. Specifically, we focus on worms that could spread entirely over 802.11 wireless networks, even if such networks are completely heterogeneous. In this environment, the main concern is not necessarily the infection of mobile devices such as PDAs and cell phones, but the existing large population of laptops, desktops, and other computers communicating over Wi-Fi. We consider worms that propagate entirely over wireless connections, trying to infect other computers tuned to the same access point (AP) and also other APs within range. A notable fraction of hosts in such an environment may also be mobile, and could therefore carry the infection from one AP to another.

In densely populated metropolitan areas, it is conceivable that such a worm could infect a large fraction of wireless-connected hosts, especially considering pervasive vulnerabilities such as those exploited by Slammer and recent browser vulnerabilities. Such "client-side" vulnerabilities are of particular interest in a Wi-Fi setting because, unlike wired environments where a user needs to visit a malicious site to get exploited, it is often possible for an infected client to inject this kind of exploit via spoofing to any session between the target and a legitimate server. In the worst case, a device driver exploit such as the recently discovered Intel driver attack could carry the worm across platforms and even bypass VPN software, which often blocks all local, wireless connections.

Although there has been considerable work in the literature on how to deal with large-scale attacks on traditional "wired" networks, there are at least three differences between wireless networks that require alternative solutions:

1. **Proximity-Based Spread:** Wireless attacks can spread contagiously over wireless links based on proximity, similar to real-world diseases, in contrast to the any-to-any communication possible over the Internet. This renders previous models and analyses of Internet-based worm propagation ineffective as they cannot be directly mapped to wireless networks.
2. **Difficult Traffic Control:** Traffic in wireless networks is difficult to control using conventional methods, lacking "hard" enforcement points such as firewalls between communicating nodes. This significantly constrains the space for potential defenses.
3. **Unique Propagation Dynamics:** The first detailed examination of the threat of worms in wireless networks. Other researchers have made attempts at deriving contagion models in MANETs, examining viruses that spread according to user mobility, or measuring propagation dynamics in a campus network. Our paper is the first to explore, in depth, the problem of wildfire worms and proximity propagation in densely populated areas. Specifically, we discuss the threat of worms that propagate entirely over Wi-Fi connections and attempt to quantify the threat in terms of infection prevalence and infection timescales. Providing reliable estimates of potential infection prevalence is important for creating awareness of the severity of the threat, while the likely infection times are needed to guide the design of suitable countermeasures. Our analysis relies on simulated outbreaks of Wi-Fi worms driven by real-world data derived from Wi-Fi maps of large metropolitan areas around the world. Among other observations, our results suggest that a carefully crafted wildfire worm can infect all vulnerable Wi-Fi-connected computers in 80% of access points in some studied areas within 10-20 minutes—timescales at which traditional defenses may not be able to react in a timely fashion.

### 2.1 Wi-Fi Worm Propagation

Figure 2 illustrates the propagation dynamics of wildfire worms. Three access points (A, B, and C) provide wireless coverage in a shared medium broadcast environment such as a WLAN. The fundamental principle is that a wildfire worm relies on local, proximity-based propagation within this environment.
