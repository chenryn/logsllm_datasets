uniform distribution with probability at least 

most T (cid:48) + (λ + 1)Tg.
B. PROOF OF LEMMA 2
The proof of Lemma 2 relies on a simple hybrid argument.
Assuming for a contradiction that there is an algorithm A
that distinguishes GN from a perfect random generator in
time T (cid:48) with an advantage greater than N , we construct
another algorithm B that distinguishes G from a perfect
random generator in time T (cid:48) with an advantage greater
than . To this end, we denote by Di for i ∈ (cid:74)0, N(cid:75), the
ables`y1, . . . , yi, G(x1), . . . , G(xN−i)´, where yj and xj are
probability distributions associated with the random vari-
independent random values chosen from {0, 1}L and {0, 1}n
respectively. Recall that (y1, . . . , y0) is the empty string and
(y1, . . . , y1) = (y1), so that D0 represents the output distri-
bution of the generator GN , and DN the uniform distri-
bution over {0, 1}LN . We let pi be the probability that A
accepts an input sequence distributed according to Di.
To test an L-bit input sequence z, B draws a random in-
`y1, . . . , yi−1, z, G(x1), . . . , G(xN−i−1)´ where the yi and xi
teger i ∈(cid:74)1, N(cid:75), applies algorithm A to the N L-bit sequence
distribution, `y1, . . . , yi−1, z, G(x1), . . . , G(xN−i−1)´ is dis-
are random numbers and outputs the value returned by A. It
can be seen that if z is distributed according to the uniform
tributed according to Di, whereas if z is distributed accord-
52ing to the output distribution of G, `y1, . . . , yi−1, z, G(x1),
. . . , G(xN−i−1)´ is distributed according to Di−1. Thus:

D. PROOF OF LEMMA 10
Before proceeding to the proof of Lemma 10, we introduce
some deﬁnitions and properties relating to the advantage of
distinguishing probability distributions over a ﬁnite set.
Definition 7. Let D and D(cid:48) be probability distributions
deﬁned over some ﬁnite set Ω and A be a probabilistic testing
algorithm, which on input x ∈ Ω outputs ‘ 1’ or ‘ 0’ respec-
tively representing the guessed distributions D and D(cid:48). We
deﬁne the advantage of A in distinguishing D from D(cid:48) as:
˛˛˛ Pr
D← Ω

The above probabilities are not only taken over x distributed
according to D or D(cid:48), but also over the random choices of A.
We further deﬁne the advantage AdvD,D(cid:48) (T ) in distinguish-
ing D from D(cid:48) in time T to be maxA
all testing algorithms A running in time at most T .

Definition 8. Given probability distributions D1 and D2
respectively deﬁned over ﬁnite sets Ω1 and Ω2, the product
D1 × D2 of distributions D1 and D2 is deﬁned to be the
probability distribution over the cartesian product Ω1 × Ω2:

Definition 9. Let I be a ﬁnite set of size p and P =
{pi}i∈I be a probability distribution over I. Let {Di}i∈I be
a set of p probability distributions deﬁned over p ﬁnite sets
{Ωi}i∈I . We can view each probability distribution Di over
Ωi as a probability distribution over the superset ∪i∈I Ωi by
using the following convention: for any x of ∪i∈I Ωi, if x ∈
Ωi then PrDi [x] keeps its value and PrDi [x] = 0 otherwise.
Using this convention, we can deﬁne the hybrid probability
distribution D = ∪
Di over Ω = I × ∪i∈I Ωi as:

∀(i, x) ∈ I × ∪i∈I Ωi, Pr

We now use these properties to prove Lemma 10, i.e. to
upper-bound the advantage in distinguishing D from D(cid:48).
For γ ∈ {0, . . . , 2q} we introduce the following notation:
– Dγ denotes the probability distribution of the sequence
`g2(x), . . . , g2(gq
1 (y)), z´ ,
1(x)), g2(y), . . . , g2(gγ
deﬁned over the set {0, 1}(γ+q+2)k+n, where x and y are
randomly chosen n-bit values, and z = gγ+1
γ denotes the uniform distribution over {0, 1}(γ+q+2)k+n.
– D(cid:48)
Therefore: D = ∪γ∈{0,...,2q}Dγ and D(cid:48) = ∪γ∈{0,...,2q}D(cid:48)
γ.
The distribution Dγ can further be viewed as the product
of the probability distributions of`g2(x), . . . , g2(gq
`g2(y), . . . , g2(gγ
1(x))´ and
(y)´, where x and y are randomly
1 (y)), gγ+1

chosen n-bit values. Put diﬀerently, Dγ is the product of
the output distribution of a truncated version of the genera-
tor Gq+1 (in which the ﬁnal state gq+1
(x) has been dropped)
and the output distribution of the generator Gγ+1. The dis-
tribution D(cid:48)
γ can be viewed as the product of the uniform
distribution deﬁned over {0, 1}(q+1)k and the uniform distri-
bution deﬁned over {0, 1}(γ+1)k+n.
