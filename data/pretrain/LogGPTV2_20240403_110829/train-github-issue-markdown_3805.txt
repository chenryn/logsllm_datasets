Opening a file from the command line and specifying a line and column did not function as expected on Windows, particularly in Windows 8.1 with Atom version 1.0.0. Neither of the following commands worked correctly:

```bash
atom.cmd article.tex:22:10
```

or

```bash
atom.cmd "article.tex:22:10"
```

Instead of opening `article.tex` at line 22 and column 10, the commands opened a file named `article.tex:22:10`.
