Opening file from command line with line-column didn't work in Windows
(particularly on Windows 8.1 and Atom 1.0.0).
Both
    > atom.cmd article.tex:22:10
and
    > atom.cmd "article.tex:22:10"
Didn't work as expected, it open the file `article.tex:22:10` and not the
`article.tex` on line 22 and column 10.
