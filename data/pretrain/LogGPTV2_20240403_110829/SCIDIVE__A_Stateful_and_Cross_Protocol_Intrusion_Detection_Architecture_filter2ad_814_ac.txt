4.2 Attacks and Demonstration of the IDS 
We 
to  demonstrate 
implement  four  attacks 
the 
functionality  of  the  IDS.  Three  of  the  four  attacks  are 
based on the vulnerabilities in the signaling protocol, i.e., 
SIP.  They  are  BYE  attack,  Fake  Instant  Messaging,  and 
Call Hijacking. The fourth is based on the vulnerabilities 
in the media transport protocol, which is the RTP attack. 
A summary of the attacks is presented in Table 1.

4.2.1  BYE  Attack.  In  this  attack  scenario,  as  shown  in 
Figure  5,  we  have  three  SIP  User  Agents  {A,  B,  and 
Attacker}.  We  also  have  a  SIP  Proxy  for  setting  up  the 
connections. The goal of the BYE attack is to prematurely 
tear  down  an  existing  dialog  session,  which  can  be 
viewed as a kind of Denial-of-Service attack. In Figure 5, 
the gold and green lines going respectively from SIP UA 
B  to  SIP  UA  A,  and  vice-versa,  represent  an  ongoing 
dialog session between A and B. Later, Attacker sends a 
faked BYE message to A. After that, A will believe that it 
is  B  who  wants  to  tear  down  the  connection  by  sending 
the  BYE  message.  A  will  stop  its  outward  RTP  flow  
immediately, while B will continue to send RTP packets 
to A, since B has no notion that the connection should be 
terminated.

Figure 5. Schematic of BYE Attack 
In  order  to  detect  this  attack,  we  create  a  rule  that 
detects  orphan  RTP  flow.  Specifically,  if  it  is  indeed  B 
who wants to stop the connection, then A should not see 
the  RTP  flow  from  B  after  getting  the  BYE  message. 
Thus, in the IDS, we create a rule which signals an alarm 
when  seeing  new  RTP  Footprints  in  the  RTP  Trail  that 
corresponds  to  the  flow  from  B  after  seeing  a  BYE  SIP 
Footprint.  Although  the  attack  itself  occurs  only  within 
the signaling protocol (SIP), our detection rule spans SIP 
and RTP and provides an illustration of the importance of 
cross-protocol detection. 
4.2.2  Fake  Instant  Messaging.  In  addition  to  IP  Phone 
Call  setup,  SIP  also  supports  Instant  Messaging.  By 
faking the header of an instant message appropriately, the 
attacker  can  forge  a  message  to  A  and  mislead  it  into 
believing the message is from B as shown in Figure 6. 
Figure 6. Schematic of Fake Instant 
Messaging Attack 
Our  rule  for  detecting  this  attack  looks  at  the  IP 
addresses  of  the  messages.  Under  most  circumstances, 
within  a  period,  messages  from  B  should  bear  the  same 
source  IP  address.  Therefore,  once  we  find  a  message 
from B which carries a different IP address, it would be 
an  indication  that  this  message  is  a  fake  one.  The  rule 
takes  rate  of  user  mobility  into  account  and  allows  for 
changes in the IP address according to the maximum rate 
of  user  motion.  Indeed,  this  rule  is  not  perfect.  If  the 
attacker is able to spoof its IP address, then this rule will 
not work. However, based on the Host-based architecture, 
this is probably the best we can do. This motivates a more 
ambitious  architecture  like  deploying  IDS  on  both  client 
ends.
4.2.3  Call  Hijacking.  Call  Hijacking  is  also  a  signaling 
based  attack.  In  this  attack,  by  sending  a  REINVITE 
message to B, the attacker can redirect the RTP flow that 
is supposed to go to B to another location, most likely the 
IP  address  of  the  machine  where  the  attacker  is. 
Normally,  a  REINVITE  message 
is  used  for  call 
migrating.  For  example,  B  wants  to  go  outdoors,  so  it 
moves the phone call  from  the  landline  phone  to  its  cell 
phone.  In  this  attack,  as  shown  in  Figure  7,  the  attacker 
abuses this feature by sending a fake REINVITE message 
to  fool  A  into  believing  that  B  is  going  to  change  its  IP 
address to a new address. 
A direct impact of this attack is that B will experience 
a continued silence since A is no longer sending its voice 
data to B. For this part, the Call Hijacking attack can be 
seen as a kind of Denial-of-Service attack. A more subtle 
impact  is  that  if  the  attacker  were  able  to  emulate  the 
voice  data  of  B,  then  after  successfully  redirecting  the 
call,  A  would  not  be  able  to  distinguish  between  B  and 
the  attacker.  This  could  lead  to  issues  of  confidentiality 
and  breach  of  privacy  since  the  attacker  will  be  able  to 
listen to what A is saying.

To detect this attack, we use a similar approach as for 
the BYE attack. Intuitively, if the REINVITE message is 
indeed from B, then A should not see any RTP flow from 
B  after  that.  By  detecting  orphan  flows,  we  are  able  to 
determine  whether  it’s  a  legitimate  REINVITE  message 
or a malicious one. 
occurred,  and  (3)  the  probability  of  missed  alarm,  Pm,
which  is  defined  as  the  probability  that  the  IDS  system 
does not flag an intrusion when one occurs. The goal is to 
make  the  reader  aware  of  the  variables  that  affect  these 
metrics  and  give  an  idea  of  practical  values.  Detailed 
performance  evaluation  with  numerical  computation  is 
the subject of ongoing work. 
Figure 7. Schematic of Call Hijacking Attack 
Figure 8. Schematic of RTP Attack 
4.2.4  RTP  Attack. All the attacks mentioned earlier  are 
signaling based attacks. The RTP attack on the contrary is 
based  on  the  vulnerabilities  in  media  transport.  In  this 
attack, the attacker sends RTP packets whose contents are 
garbage (both the header and the payload are filled with 
random  bytes)  to  one  of  the  persons  in  a  dialog.  In  this 
example, as shown in Figure 8, the attacker sends garbage 
bytes  to  A.  Since  these  garbage  packets  will  corrupt  the 
jitter buffer in the IP Phone client, depending on different 
implementations,  this  attack  could  result  in  intermittent 
voice conversation or in crashing the client. For example, 
in our experiment, X-Lite will crash after this attack while 
the  effect  on  Microsoft  Messenger  is  intermittent  voice 
conversation. This attack also leads to degradation in QoS 
(jitter) and in the voice quality. 
The  rule  we  use  for  detecting  this  attack  is  that  the 
sequence  number  in  succeeding  RTP  packets  should 
increase regularly. Specifically, if we see two consecutive 
packets  whose  sequence  numbers  have  a  difference 
greater  than  100,  the  IDS  will  signal  an  alarm.  The 
number  100  is  empirically  observed  to  be  the  bound  for 
normal traffic.  
4.3
Performance Evaluation 
In this section, we comment on the performance of the 
IDS system with respect to three metrics: (1) the detection 
delay,  D ,  which  is  defined  as  the  time  from  when  an 
attack/intrusion is made to the time it is detected, (2) the 
probability  of  false  alarm,  Pf,  which  is  defined  as  the 
probability that the IDS flags an intrusion when none has 
4.3.1  BYE  and  Call  Hijacking  attack.  In  both  these 
attacks,  the  IDS  rule  looks  at  the  SIP  signaling  event 
(BYE  or  REINVITE)  and  monitors  the  media  stream 
following  this  event  to  detect  an  intrusion.  Specifically, 
the arrival of an RTP packet at the original RTP port from 
the original sender flags an intrusion. 
(cid:137) Detection  Delay:  Measuring  from  the  time  the  SIP 
message is received, it includes the time up to the arrival 
of  the  RTP  packet  from  the  original  sender.  Obviously, 
the  time  depends  on  the  frequency  of  RTP  packets.  A 
typical period employed is 20 milliseconds. However, the 
RTP  packet  arrival  depends  also  on 
the  network 
conditions. Specifically, the delay distribution of packets 
from the sender to the receiver would cause this quantity 
to change.
