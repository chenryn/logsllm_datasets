**Current behavior**  
When compiling using webpack, in angular rc7 core libraries there are a couple
of warnings.
**Expected behavior**  
I guess no warnings... :-)
**Reproduction of the problem**  
Install a bare project, the simplest you like using webpack with the Angular2
rc7 revision and you will get the warnings.
**Please tell us about your environment:**  
All the last versions of Angular2 rc7, typings, ts and webpack related
dependencies. All of them on the latest versions npm has.
  * **Angular version:**  
2.0.0-rc.7
