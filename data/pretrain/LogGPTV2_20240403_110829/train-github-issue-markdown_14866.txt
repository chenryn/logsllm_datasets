### Reproducing code example:
    In [118]: import numpy as np                                                                                                                                                                  
    In [119]: a = np.random.random((5,6,7))                                                                                                                                                       
    In [120]: a[0, :, [1,2]].shape                                                                                                                                                                
    Out[120]: (2, 6)
one would expect shape `(6, 2)`...
Seems to occur only if the first index is set to a unique index and the last
one to an iterable of indices
### NumPy/Python version information:
    In [121]: import sys, numpy; print(numpy.__version__, sys.version)
