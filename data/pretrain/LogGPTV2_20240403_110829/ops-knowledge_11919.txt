User:  MySQL replication principle and process
Assistant: The principle and process of MySQL replication: 1. Master: the binlog thread records all the statements that change the database data and puts them into the binlog on the master; 2. Slave: the io thread is responsible for pulling the binlog from the master after using the start slave 3. Slave: sql execution thread executes the statements in the relay log; 4. Data synchronization between master and slave databases through network communication.
