1. **Viewing `.d.ts` Files for `@types/X` Without Cloning the Repository:**
   - I would like to view the `.d.ts` files for the `@types/X` package without cloning the repository. However, when I open the `types` folder on GitHub, I encounter the following error: 
     ```
     Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. 3,413 entries were omitted from the list.
     ```
   - Additionally, the `X` folder is not listed in the truncated directory.

2. **Reviewing and Filing Issues for `@types/X`:**
   - I want to review existing issues for the `@types/X` package and potentially file a new one. However, when I navigate to the Issues tab, I see over 2,000 entries for all packages combined. This makes it challenging to find issues specific to the `@types/X` package.
   - I am curious about how contributors manage to locate issues filed for their specific type definitions. Is there a more efficient way to handle this?
   - Additionally, I wonder why these type definitions are not hosted in separate repositories. It seems that the current monorepo structure might be overly complex and difficult to manage.

### Summary
- The current monorepo structure for `@types` packages on GitHub presents challenges in both viewing the `.d.ts` files and managing issues. The directory truncation and the large number of issues make it difficult to work with specific packages. A more organized approach, such as hosting each package in its own repository, might improve the experience for both users and contributors.
