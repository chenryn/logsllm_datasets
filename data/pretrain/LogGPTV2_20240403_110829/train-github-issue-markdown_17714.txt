  1. I want to see .d.ts for `@types/X` package without cloning repo.  
But when I open types folder on github I see following error, and `X` folder
is not listed.  
`Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. 3,413 entries were
omitted from the list.`
  2. I want to see what issues already filed for `@types/X` and file new one.  
But when I open issues tab I see >2k entries for all the packages... I wonder
how contributors even find issues filed for their definitions (or they
don't?).
Why typings do not live in separate repos? Isn't this monorepo a total mess?
