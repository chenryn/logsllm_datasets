**Current behavior**
[(ngModel)] without name is not allowed in a form. This used to work in the
previous(now deprecated) forms. I think a mix for template and model driven
form in the same template should be allowed. I see the following error when
ngModel is used in a form without a associated control.
Name attribute must be set if ngModel is used within a form.  
Example: 
**Expected/desired behavior**
[(ngModel)] should be allowed in a form without an associated control
**Reproduction of the problem**
You can see the error in the dev console of this plunker

**What is the expected behavior?**  
[(ngModel)] should be allowed in a form without an associated control.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Allow mix of template and model driven form. This is specially useful in case
part of the form in not really part of the actual business model.
