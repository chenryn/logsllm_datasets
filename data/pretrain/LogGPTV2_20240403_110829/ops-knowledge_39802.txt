User: In python, I enumerate top-level windows through EnumWindows, and also I enumerate the processes through EnumProcesses.
Then in the python script, I put all the window handles which belongs to the same pid into one list (I did this through GetWindowThreadProcessId).
Later I found out something: there are 3 window handles which belong to notepad.exe, but I only open one text file. 
Why?
Besides, I tried to set the text window as the foreground window through SetForegroundWindow, I passed the three window handles to this function, and two work.
How could this be ?
Assistant: Processes sometimes create invisible windows for their own purposes. You should ignore them (use IsWindowVisible function).
