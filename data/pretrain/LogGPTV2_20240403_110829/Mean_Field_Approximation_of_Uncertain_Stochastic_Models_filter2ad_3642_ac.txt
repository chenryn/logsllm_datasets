fI (XS, XI ; ϑ) = aXS + ϑXSXI − bXI
(11)
By Theorem 1 and Corollary 1, as the number of object
goes to inﬁnity, the behaviour of the uncertain model (an
unknown but constant ϑ) converges to the ODE
˙x = f (x, ϑ)
while the imprecise model (a unknown θ that can vary in time)
is included in the solution of the differential inclusion
(cid:5)
˙x ∈
{f (x, ϑ)}
ϑ∈[ϑmin,ϑmax]
In what follows, we will compare numerically the be-
haviour of the two models. In particular, we show that de-
spite the fact that the infection rate minus the recovery rate
fI (XS, XI ; ϑ) = aXS + ϑXSXI − bXI is an increasing
function of ϑ, the quantity xI (t) is not a monotone function of
ϑ. In particular, when ϑ(t) ∈ [ϑ min, ϑ max], the proportion
of infected nodes can be higher for an imprecise population
process than for any uncertain population process.
In the rest of this section, we set the parameters equal to
a = 0.1, b = 5, c = 1, ϑmin = 1, ϑmax = 10 and the initial
conditions are XS(0) = 0.7, XI (0) = 0.3, XR(0) = 0.

B. Reachable sets in ﬁnite time
For a ﬁxed parameter ϑ,
S , X ϑ
the drift f (XS, XI , ϑ) is
Lipschitz-continuous in XS and XI. Hence, the drift of the
uncertain model, deﬁned in Equation (5), is a single-valued
function and the ODE ( ˙S, ˙I) = f (XS, XI , ϑ) has a unique
solution, which we denote by X ϑ
I . This ODE does not
have a close-form solution but numerical integration is easy.
The case of the imprecise model is more complicated.
By Theorem 1, whatever are the variation of the param-
eter θ (even if
it ϑt depends on the whole history of
the process X N

verges to a solution of the differential inclusion ( ˙xS, ˙xI ) ∈
{f (xS, xI , ϑ) : ϑ ∈ [ϑmin, ϑmax]}. In particular, if SF is the
set of solutions of the differential inclusions and RF (t) is
the set of reachable points at some time t by the differential
inclusion starting in (XS(0), XI (0)), we have:

On Figure 2, we add to Figure 1 two examples of tra-
jectories that attain the maximum (top) or minimum (bottom)
number of infected nodes at time T = 3. These maximal and
minimal trajectories are in fact solutions of bang-bang control
policies. For the trajectory that maximises XI (3), the control
θ(t) equals ϑmin for t  2.25. For
the trajectory that minimises XI (3), the control θ(t) is to start
with ϑmin for t < 0.7, then use ϑmax until t = 2.2 and then
use again ϑmin.
C. Steady-state regime
Computing the Birkhoff centre BF of a differential in-
clusion is in general not easy. A ﬁrst possibility is to use
Pontryagin’s principle to compute the convex hull of the set
of reachable points at time t. By letting t goes to inﬁnity,
this allows one to compute the convex hull of the asymptotic
set AF (deﬁned in Equation (6)), which is a super-set of the
Birkhoff centre BF .
For the SIR model, we use a more direct approach, that
is faster and more accurate for a two dimensional system.
By integrating the ODE ˙x = F (x, ϑmax), we ﬁrst compute
a point x0 that is the ﬁxed point of the uncertain model with
ﬁxed parameter ϑmax. We then compute a trajectory x1 by

Fig. 3: Steady-state regime for the imprecise and uncertain
SIR models. The steady-state of the imprecise model is the
convex set delimited by the blue region. The steady-state of
the uncertain model is on the red line. We set ϑmax = 10ϑmin.
integrating the ODE ˙x = F (x, ϑmin) starting in x0 and a
trajectory x2 by integrating the ODE ˙x = F (x, ϑmax) starting
in x1(∞). The two curves delimit a convex region that is
included in the Birkhoff centre. We then start from any points
on the surface of this region and we look for a value ϑ such that
the drift is directed outside this region. If such a value exists,
we then enlarge our region by computing a new trajectory with
parameter ϑ. We repeat these iterations until no such point on
the surface exists. When this region cannot be enlarged, we
then obtain the Birkhoff centre of the differential inclusion.
This is so because the drift vector never points outwards the
region in any point of its boundary, meaning that no trajectory
can escape from it.
In Figure 3, we compare the Birkhoff centre of the im-
precise ﬂuid model with the one of the uncertain ﬂuid model.
The steady-state of the uncertain ﬂuid model is shown in red
while the steady-state of the imprecise model corresponds to
the whole convex region surrounded by the blue curve. We
observe that the steady-state of the uncertain model is strictly
included in the one of the imprecise model. Moreover, there
are some points of the Birkhoff centre of the imprecise model
for which XS is smaller and XI is larger that any stationary
point of the uncertain model.
D. Comparison with the differential-hull approximation
It should be noted that the algorithms based on the Pontrya-
gin’s maximum principle provide an exact numerical method
to compute the transient and steady-state behaviour of these
systems. On the contrary, the differential-hull approximation,
introduced in Section IV-B provides a reasonably accurate
results when the range of the parameter θ is small but its
accuracy is very poor when the range of parameters increases.
These facts are illustrated in Figure 5 and Figure 4. In
Figure 4, we plot the solutions as a function of time. We
observe that when the range of possible ϑ is small (ϑmax = 2),
then the differential hull approximation is quite accurate. When
ϑmax grows, the approximation is less and less accurate. For
example, for ϑmax = 5, the approximation is that XI (t) ∈
