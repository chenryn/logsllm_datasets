Hi!
**Postive:**  
I've been so happy with Atom, it replaced my IntelliJ/PHPStorm and other IDE's
incl. Vim and Sublime Text as a general purpose editor and sometimes IDE for a
wide array of languages.
**Negative:**  
Now here is my problem: The startup-time is frustrating.
Can't I run atom as a daemon during startup and attach it to the daemon like
emacs-client?
Hey, that's also a good business model for you @github 👍
