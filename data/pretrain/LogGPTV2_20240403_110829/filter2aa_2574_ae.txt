 Wi-Fi Eavesdropping
Free Wi-Fi access points are spread almost everywhere. An attacker can exploit 
vulnerabilities in such devices to intercept all the communication—via phone calls, 
instant messages, and video conferences—that’s gone through them. It is highly 
recommended not to use free Wi-Fi service in public places unless a strong virtual 
private network (VPN) has been used to protect the connection.

 Security Software
It is essential to install an antivirus solution on your computer before a malicious piece 
of software compromises it. Having an antivirus program is considered the first line of 
defense against cyberattacks. New viruses are created nearly every minute. It is the job of 
the antivirus software to keep up with the latest threats.
Bear in mind that having an antivirus program installed on your machine does 
not give you 100 percent protection. With the sophistication of modern cyberattacks, 
you need more than one measure to protect your computing devices and network. For 
instance, installing a firewall solution is equally essential as the antivirus program. Many 
antivirus solutions come equipped with a built-in firewall. In this book, we will mention 
only the free products.
 Antivirus
Commercial antivirus solutions are always better than their free counterparts (see 
Table 2-1), so we will begin by talking about the recommended features that must be 
existed within any antivirus solution to be considered useful.
• 
It should be equipped with a built-firewall.
• 
It should be able to scan email clients—such as Thunderbird and 
Outlook—and detect phishing attacks.
• 
It must update itself automatically and discover zero-day malware 
before it hits your machine.
• 
It should be able to detect advanced malware like rootkits and 
ransomware and all kinds of malicious software like adware and 
spyware.
• 
It should protect your browser from browser exploits and have DNS 
protection.
• 
It must not consume high computing resources to operate.

Windows 10 comes supplied with a free antivirus solution, Windows Defender. 
This program helps guard your PC against viruses and other advanced threats such as 
rootkits and bootkits; however, its main disadvantage is the lack of a personal firewall. 
This should not let you underestimate Windows Defender because you can install a free 
dedicated firewall, as we will show next.
 Firewall
A firewall monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic and helps 
you to screen out hackers, viruses, and worms that try to reach your computer over 
the Internet. As we already said, not all free antivirus solutions come equipped with a 
personal firewall, but there are many free dedicated personal firewalls that can do the 
job. See Table 2-2 for the most well-known ones.

 Anti-malware
Cyberattacks are being developed continually. Every day sophisticated malicious scripts 
and programs are created by cybercriminals, and anti-malware solutions help to detect 
threats that were not previously discovered by regular antivirus solutions. To achieve 
maximum protection, it is necessary to have an anti-malware solution in addition to 
your installed antivirus program.
The free edition of Spybot (https://www.safer-networking.org/dl/) has an 
anti- malware and anti-spyware functionality that can be installed along with your 
antivirus solution.
Another famous program for detecting malware is Malwarebytes  
(https://www.malwarebytes.com). The free version has the basic anti-malware and 
spyware protection in addition to its ability to remove rootkits and repairs the files that 
are damaged. It can also work with any antivirus program already installed.
 Securing the Operating System
No matter what kinds of security software you have already installed on your OS, 
securing the OS itself is still the first task you should do before installing any programs or 
accessing the local network or the Internet.
There are two types of risks that threaten the security of your OS.
• 
Logical threats originating from malware and other malicious 
programs.
• 
Physical threats. These happen when an attacker gains physical 
access to your machine (for example, through USB or other ports) to 
perform a crafted, malicious action.

We already covered how to secure the first part of the logical side of the OS through 
installing security software. In this section, we will continue to cover other parts of OS 
logical security—which is related to OS configuration—in addition to physical security.
We will not delve into the OS security as that requires a book of its own. For this 
book, we will cover the main security configuration that you should do to enhance OS 
security and privacy. The focus will be on the Windows OS because it is the most widely 
used OS on earth.
 Hardening the Windows OS
The Windows OS is not intended to be a secure, anonymous OS. When conducting 
OSINT searches, you should avoid revealing your real identity online. Windows can 
be configured to be more private following a simple steps. Besides, the software and 
techniques that we are going to demonstrate later will allow you to conduct your OSINT 
searches anonymously in addition to hiding/masking your digital fingerprint.
Note! There are many different operating systems, like macOS, linux, and 
Windows in addition to mobile OSs like iOS from apple and android from Google. 
Whatever OS you use, it has not been created to be completely anonymous and 
private. There are special distributions—usually based on linux—that provide 
maximum security and anonymity when going online like Tails OS, as you are going 
to see later in this chapter.
Warning! Create a new system restore point before implementing the tweaks in 
this chapter so you can safely revert your changes in case something goes wrong.
For now, let’s begin our list of recommendations to harden your Windows box.
 Updating Windows
The Automatic Update feature for the Windows OS should always be turned on. 
Windows 10 Update is set to automatic by default.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
35
 Updating All Installed Programs
Windows usually updates Microsoft programs—such as the Microsoft Office suite and 
the Edge (IE) browser—as part of Windows Update, but you should make sure that other 
programs (Adobe Reader, VPN clients, Firefox, and Opera) are also updated regularly.
 Locking Your PC Using a USB Drive
The default Windows login authentication does not offer the necessary security for its 
users. Many black hat hackers have successfully compromised this functionality to gain 
unauthorized access to Windows. To add an additional layer of security, you can lock your 
PC with a USB drive in addition to the default login. This procedure is necessary for older 
versions of Windows (7, XP) that cannot be protected using enhanced Windows 10 features.
USB Raptor allows you to lock your PC using a USB flash card. It is a free program 
with many advanced features. You can find it at https://sourceforge.net/projects/
usbraptor/?source=typ_redirect.
 Using a Less-Privileged User Account
When conducting OSINT searches, there is no need to use an administrator account; 
it is always advisable that you use a limited user account for your daily tasks. This will 
effectively protect your computer from malware installed inadvertently and prevent 
outside hackers from invading your system and installing malicious software. You can 
configure Windows (all versions) accounts by going to Control Panel ➤ User Accounts.
 Using a Strong Password for Windows
Use a strong password to protect your Windows login and make sure to change it once 
every three months. Later in this chapter, we will give tips on how to create strong 
passwords and store them within a password manager.
To enforce a password policy under Windows 10 (all editions), follow these steps:
 1. Go to Control Panel ➤ Administrative Tools ➤ Local Security 
Policy ➤ Security Settings ➤ Account Polices ➤ Password Policy.
 2. On the right side, double-click the “Maximum password age” policy.
 3. Set the number of days a password can be used before Windows 
10 requires users to change it to 90 days.

 Disabling Remote Assistance
This feature allows a remote user to access your machine over a network connection. If 
you are not using this feature, you can disable it to prevent hackers from exploiting it to 
gain unauthorized access your machine. To disable it in Windows 10, follow these steps 
(see Figure 2-4):
 1. Enter remote settings into the Cortana search box and select 
“Allow remote access to your computer.”
 Keeping Your User Account Control Turned On
User Account Control (UAC) monitors what changes are going to be made to your 
computer by showing a pop-up window when you try to perform actions that require 
administrative access, like installing/uninstalling a program. Turning on UAC will help 
you to deter malware from making changes to your computer. You can adjust UAC for 
each user account through Control Panel ➤ User Accounts; then click “Change User 
Account Control settings” (see Figure 2-3).

changes to Windows and other applications

 2. Make sure that the option “Don’t allow remote connections to this 
computer” is selected.
Figure 2-4. Disabling remote connections in Windows 10
 Making Hidden Files Visible
Some malware and other malicious programs come hidden using the same attribute that 
Windows uses to hide its system files. To display hidden files and folders under Windows 
10, select Control Panel ➤ File Explorer Options and then go to the View tab and select 
the option “Show hidden files, folders, and drives.” Also, make sure to uncheck the 
option “Hide Protected operating systems files.” It is advisable to view file extensions by 
unchecking the option “Hide extensions for known file types.”
 Freezing the Hard Disk
The freezing software allows a Windows user to restore their OS to a previous stable state 
within seconds each time the computer restarts. For example, consider a situation when 
a piece of malware hits your OS if you already have a freezing program and it is activated. 
All you need to do is to restart your machine and everything will return to its previous 
state.

RollBack Rx Home Edition (free for personal use) is a program for freezing Windows 
machines. You can find it at http://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/
rollback-rx-home/.
 Setting a Password for BIOS/UEFI
Many cyberattacks against operating systems and encryption software (full disk 
encryption) rely on booting the victim’s machine using a USB or CD/DVD to crack 
the encryption keys or to find a way to steal the victim’s sensitive data. By a setting a 
password for the BIOS/UEFI, each time the user boots the machine, he needs to provide 
some sort of credentials—hence a password—before the computer loads the OS. This 
trick will also prevent an attacker from changing your BIOS settings or damaging your 
computer by wiping your hard drive clean. Each motherboard manufacturer has its own 
menu to set this password, usually in a Security section. You should first boot to BOIS/
UEFI and then activate this option.
 Disabling Unnecessary Ports/Protocols and Services
Each open port is considered a security risk. Hackers usually scan open ports to try 
to get access to a victim’s machine. Monitoring traffic going through ports is a firewall 
task; when you configure your personal firewall properly, it will prevent attackers 
from exploiting open ports for malicious purposes. The best secure configuration is 
the “interactive mode” (in Comodo firewall, this rule is called Custom Ruleset) where 
the firewall asks you to grant or deny access to any connection going through OS ports 
(see Figure 2-5).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
39
Like ports, unnecessary services should be disabled. Windows load essential services 
upon starting, but other unused services should be disabled.
To disable a service under Windows, do the following:
 1. Go to Control Panel ➤ Administrative Tools ➤ Services.
 2. Locate a service to disable.
 3. Double-click it to open its Properties dialog box.
 4. Choose Disabled as the startup type.
 Staying Private in Windows 10
Compared with the previous Windows versions, Windows 10 comes equipped with 
enhanced security features for encryption and authentication. Windows 10 is also more 
robust against bootkits and rootkit attacks. To use the modern security features offered 
by Windows 10, your computer must have certain hardware components.
• 
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0: This is used to store the 
cryptographic keys of BitLocker. This is a full disk encryption feature 
offered by some editions of Windows 10 (Windows 10 supports 
BitLocker on Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions).

application is trying to establish an ongoing connection with a remote host
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
40
• 
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI): This is the BIOS 
replacement used in modern certified Windows computers.
• 
Fingerprint scanner: This enhances the traditional Windows 
authentication schema.
A retinal scanner and a 3D camera for facial recognition are highly recommended 
so you can activate the advanced biometric authentication scheme of the Windows 10 
Hello feature. However, their existence in modern computers is still limited because they 
increase a computer’s price significantly.
As we already said, Windows 10 enhances the regular Windows authentication by 
introducing a modern authentication mechanism called Hello. This app allows a user to 
log in to a machine using a fingerprint, face, or even iris. User biometric data will not be 
stored anywhere online—according to Microsoft—for this feature to work.
It is highly recommended not to use the Hello feature on the computer where you 
are going to conduct your OSINT search. It is always advisable to use the local Windows 
account when signing into Windows as no one can guarantee what might happen when 
you send your credentials or other sensitive information over an unsecured medium like 
the Internet.
Windows 10 comes equipped with many new features to personalize the user 
experience when using it. For instance, Cortana is a Windows digital assistance that 
allows a user to navigate Windows using voice commands; it also monitors user actions 
on Windows—such as what the user types and searches for—and personalizes future 
events according to this. To control Cortana’s collection and use of your data, check 
https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-cortana-and-privacy, which 
contains instructions on how to disable it on different Windows devices.
Several privacy configurations of Windows 10 are stored in one location. Windows 10 
created a privacy dashboard that is accessed by pressing Windows key + i to access the 
Settings page and then selecting Privacy (see Figure 2-6).
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
41
Everything in the Privacy dashboard is self-explanatory; it is advisable to disable 
everything you do not need and not to use the Microsoft Edge browser for conducting 
online searches. Skype, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive are also not recommended for 
exchanging important files. Secure alternatives to these programs will be given later in 
the chapter.
 Destroying Digital Traces
Data destruction is an important step in covering your digital traces when conducting 
OSINT searches. Digital traces—previous usage—on the computer remain even after 
formatting it many times. There are three ways in which data—and remnants of it—can 
be destroyed securely: physical, degaussing and logical destruction (sanitizing). We will 
briefly describe each technique, but let’s first talk about the different types of hard drives 
in use today.

There are two types of hard drives currently used in computing devices.
• 
Hard disk drive (HDD): This is the old type that has been used since 
the early days of personal computers. It is a mechanical device that 
mainly consists of a metal platter (could be more than one) made 
of glass or aluminum coated with magnetic material to store data. 
HDDs are usually used for mass storage and cost less than SSDs.
• 
Solid-state drive (SSD): This is a more advanced version of a drive. 
It does not contain any moving parts and has no platters. Instead, it 
stores data on small microchip units (like USB flash drives). SSD is 
faster and smaller than HDD but has a limited lifespan compared  
to HDD.
Modern computers—and all smartphones and tablets—use SSD as the only storage 
unit type; however, this does not mean that HDD is going to fade away. HDD is a mature 
technology, and it will remain in use for a long time according to many studies.
For this book, let us see the difference between SSD and HDD in terms of data 
recovery.
Recovering data from an HDD is relatively easy and can be conducted by any user 
with the appropriate tools. When you delete a file on an HDD, the file is not deleted 
directly; instead, only the pointer to this file on disk is deleted. This operation helps to 
speed up the deletion process, saving valuable time. Recovering data from an SSD drive 
is quite difficult and impossible in many cases. For instance, an SSD uses a different 
mechanism when handling deleted files. All modern SSDs utilize the TRIM command 
when enabled. This command will remove deleted file data blocks instantly, allowing for 
another file to take up that space. This speeds up the writing process the next time the OS 
needs to write data onto the drive. There are many approaches to implementing TRIM 
on SSD devices, depending on the OS in use. Some operating systems will execute TRIM 
instantly after each file deletion, while others will execute TRIM at regular intervals.
Now, let’s see how data can be destroyed completely when using both types of hard 
drive. The following techniques are used to achieve this:
• 
Physical destruction: This is the most secure and usually preferred 
method used by intelligence services and giant corporations to 
destroy classified and high-grade data assets. This technique works 
by physically destroying the storage medium—whether it is HDD, 
SSD, CD/DVD, or flash drive—so that it is no longer can be used.
CHapTer 2  INTrOduCTION TO ONlINe THreaTS aNd COuNTermeaSureS
43
• 
Degaussing: This is another secure technique to prevent antirecovery 
techniques from recovering your data from the storage medium; it 
works by exposing the storage medium to the powerful magnetic field 
of a degausser to destroy the stored data magnetically. This technique 
works well with HDD. SSD devices are better destroyed physically to 
avoid the ability to recover top-secret data.
