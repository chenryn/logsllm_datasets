### Wi-Fi Eavesdropping
Free Wi-Fi access points are ubiquitous, and attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to intercept all communication—such as phone calls, instant messages, and video conferences—passing through them. It is highly recommended to avoid using free Wi-Fi services in public places unless a strong virtual private network (VPN) is used to protect the connection.

### Chapter 2: Introduction to Online Threats and Countermeasures

#### Security Software
It is essential to install an antivirus solution on your computer before it is compromised by malicious software. An antivirus program is considered the first line of defense against cyberattacks. New viruses are created almost every minute, and it is the job of the antivirus software to keep up with the latest threats.

Keep in mind that having an antivirus program installed does not provide 100% protection. With the sophistication of modern cyberattacks, you need multiple layers of security to protect your computing devices and network. For example, installing a firewall solution is equally important. Many antivirus solutions come equipped with a built-in firewall. In this book, we will focus on free products.

#### Antivirus
Commercial antivirus solutions generally offer better protection than their free counterparts (see Table 2-1). We will begin by discussing the key features that should be included in any effective antivirus solution:

- **Built-in Firewall:** The antivirus should include a firewall.
- **Email Client Scanning:** It should scan email clients like Thunderbird and Outlook for phishing attacks.
- **Automatic Updates:** It must update itself automatically and detect zero-day malware before it infects your system.
- **Advanced Malware Detection:** It should be capable of detecting advanced malware such as rootkits and ransomware, as well as other types of malicious software like adware and spyware.
- **Browser Protection:** It should protect your browser from exploits and have DNS protection.
- **Resource Efficiency:** It should not consume excessive computing resources.

#### Firewall
A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic, helping to screen out hackers, viruses, and worms. Not all free antivirus solutions come with a personal firewall, but there are many dedicated free firewalls available (see Table 2-2).

#### Anti-malware
Cyberattacks are continuously evolving, with new malicious scripts and programs being created daily. Anti-malware solutions help detect threats that regular antivirus solutions may miss. To achieve maximum protection, it is necessary to have an anti-malware solution in addition to your antivirus program.

- **Spybot (Free Edition):** This tool has anti-malware and anti-spyware functionality and can be installed alongside your antivirus solution. [https://www.safer-networking.org/dl/](https://www.safer-networking.org/dl/)
- **Malwarebytes (Free Version):** This program provides basic anti-malware and spyware protection, can remove rootkits, and repair damaged files. It can also work with any existing antivirus program. [https://www.malwarebytes.com](https://www.malwarebytes.com)

#### Securing the Operating System
Regardless of the security software you have installed, securing the operating system (OS) itself is the first task you should perform before installing any programs or accessing the local network or the Internet. There are two types of risks that threaten the security of your OS:

- **Logical Threats:** These originate from malware and other malicious programs.
- **Physical Threats:** These occur when an attacker gains physical access to your machine (e.g., through USB or other ports) to perform malicious actions.

We have already covered how to secure the logical side of the OS through installing security software. In this section, we will cover other aspects of OS logical security, including configuration, and physical security.

#### Hardening the Windows OS
The Windows OS is not designed to be a secure, anonymous OS. When conducting OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) searches, you should avoid revealing your real identity online. Windows can be configured to be more private with a few simple steps. Additionally, the software and techniques we will demonstrate later will allow you to conduct your OSINT searches anonymously and hide your digital footprint.

**Note:** There are many different operating systems, such as macOS, Linux, and Windows, as well as mobile OSs like iOS and Android. None of these are designed to be completely anonymous and private. Special distributions, usually based on Linux, like Tails OS, provide maximum security and anonymity when going online.

**Warning:** Create a new system restore point before implementing the tweaks in this chapter so you can safely revert your changes if something goes wrong.

Here are some recommendations to harden your Windows box:

- **Updating Windows:** Ensure the Automatic Update feature for the Windows OS is always turned on. Windows 10 updates are set to automatic by default.
- **Updating All Installed Programs:** While Windows updates Microsoft programs, ensure other programs (like Adobe Reader, VPN clients, Firefox, and Opera) are also updated regularly.
- **Locking Your PC Using a USB Drive:** The default Windows login authentication is not secure. You can add an additional layer of security by locking your PC with a USB drive. USB Raptor is a free program that allows you to do this. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbraptor/?source=typ_redirect](https://sourceforge.net/projects/usbraptor/?source=typ_redirect)
- **Using a Less-Privileged User Account:** Use a limited user account for daily tasks to protect your computer from malware and prevent outside hackers from installing malicious software. Configure Windows accounts via Control Panel ➤ User Accounts.
- **Using a Strong Password for Windows:** Use a strong password for your Windows login and change it every three months. Later in this chapter, we will provide tips on creating and storing strong passwords.
- **Disabling Remote Assistance:** If you are not using this feature, disable it to prevent unauthorized access. In Windows 10, go to Control Panel ➤ Administrative Tools ➤ Local Security Policy ➤ Security Settings ➤ Account Policies ➤ Password Policy.
- **Keeping Your User Account Control Turned On:** UAC (User Account Control) monitors changes to your computer and shows a pop-up window for actions requiring administrative access. Adjust UAC settings via Control Panel ➤ User Accounts.
- **Making Hidden Files Visible:** Some malware hides using the same attribute that Windows uses to hide system files. To display hidden files and folders in Windows 10, go to Control Panel ➤ File Explorer Options, then select the View tab and choose “Show hidden files, folders, and drives.”
- **Freezing the Hard Disk:** Freezing software allows you to restore your OS to a previous stable state. RollBack Rx Home Edition is a free program for freezing Windows machines. [http://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/rollback-rx-home/](http://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/rollback-rx-home/)
- **Setting a Password for BIOS/UEFI:** Set a password for the BIOS/UEFI to prevent unauthorized access. Each motherboard manufacturer has its own menu to set this password, usually in the Security section.
- **Disabling Unnecessary Ports/Protocols and Services:** Open ports are security risks. Properly configure your personal firewall to monitor and control traffic. Disable unnecessary services via Control Panel ➤ Administrative Tools ➤ Services.
- **Staying Private in Windows 10:** Windows 10 has enhanced security features for encryption and authentication. Ensure your computer has the necessary hardware components, such as TPM 2.0, UEFI, and a fingerprint scanner.
- **Destroying Digital Traces:** Data destruction is crucial for covering your digital traces. There are three methods: physical destruction, degaussing, and logical destruction (sanitizing). HDDs and SSDs differ in data recovery and destruction. Physical destruction is the most secure method, while degaussing works well for HDDs. SSDs are better destroyed physically to prevent data recovery.

By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security and privacy of your Windows OS.
