ABSTRACT
BGP hijacks remain an acute problem in today’s Internet, with wide-
spread consequences. While hijack detection systems are readily
available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership infor-
mation and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take on a new
perspective on BGP hijacking activity: we introduce and track the
long-term routing behavior of serial hijackers, networks that re-
peatedly hijack address blocks for malicious purposes, often over
the course of many months or even years. Based on a ground truth
dataset that we construct by extracting information from network
operator mailing lists, we illuminate the dominant routing char-
acteristics of serial hijackers, and how they differ from legitimate
networks. We then distill features that can capture these behavioral
differences and train a machine learning model to automatically
identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) that exhibit characteristics
similar to serial hijackers. Our classifier identifies ≈ 900 ASes with
similar behavior in the global IPv4 routing table. We analyze and
categorize these networks, finding a wide range of indicators of
malicious activity, misconfiguration, as well as benign hijacking
activity. Our work presents a solid first step towards identifying
and understanding this important category of networks, which
can aid network operators in taking proactive measures to defend
themselves against prefix hijacking and serve as input for current
and future detection systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
BGP’s lack of route authentication and validation remains a press-
ing problem in today’s Internet. The lack of deployment of basic
origin validation of route announcements in BGP not only makes
the Internet more susceptible to connectivity issues due to miscon-
figurations, but also opens the door for malicious actors. While
a long-standing problem, its severity becomes clear in numerous
recent reports of widespread connectivity issues due to BGP miscon-
figuration [14], as well as hijacking events of popular destinations
in the Internet [38]. Episodes range from simpler attacks with the
goal of using blocks to send spam emails [56] to more sophisticated
misuse of BGP to intercept traffic or steal crypto currencies [9].
While the operator and research communities have devoted
substantial resources to improve the state-of-the-art of BGP security
(i.e., the RPKI [12]), little has changed in production environments.
Today, operators can use monitoring services [2] to automatically
detect potential hijacks of their prefix announcements. Current
hijack detection systems typically rely on assumptions of prefix
ownership and track origin changes in the global routing table. If an
event is detected, the victim network can react and attempt to get
in contact with the perpetrator or its upstream networks to solve
the problem. However, many times this contact is not fruitful or not
even possible. At that point, victims of hijacks are only left with the
option of publicly disclosing the event in network operator mailing
lists in the hope that peer pressure and manual interventions by
other networks, such as filtering announcements or refusing to
provide transit, will remediate the situation.
What most BGP hijack detection systems have in common is that
(i) they are reactive in nature, i.e., they identify hijacking events
only after they occurred, and (ii) they are event-based, i.e., they
track individual hijacking events. However, malicious BGP behavior
by an actor is sometimes consistent over time, creating opportu-
nities for methods based on longitudinal analysis, potentially in-
forming proactive approaches (e.g., scoring systems) and providing
situational awareness. We indeed find that many hijacking events
disclosed in operator mailing lists and network security blogs in-
volve malicious Autonomous Systems (ASes) that repeatedly hijack
prefixes, i.e., originate prefixes allocated to and routed by other
networks. In fact, some of these ASes show malicious activity in
the global routing table for multiple years, and we refer to networks
of this type as serial hijackers. Serial hijackers pose an ongoing
threat, yet they have received surprisingly little attention in terms
of empirical assessment.

In this paper, we provide a systematic empirical analysis of the
behavioral characteristics of serial hijacker ASes. We take on a new
perspective on illicit BGP activity: instead of looking at individual
BGP hijacking events, we study the long-term prefix advertisement
dynamics in the global routing table in space and time. Our analysis
leads to a set of key attributes that broadly capture the behavior of
serial hijacker ASes, highlighting several interesting and previously
undocumented cases. Our main contributions are:
• We provide a detailed and longitudinal study of BGP an-
nouncement dynamics of serial hijacker ASes over the course
of 5 years. We develop hypotheses on prefix origination be-
havior (announcement stability, visibility, growth, address
space fragmentation, origin conflicts) and identify dominant
characteristics of serial hijackers and how they differ from
legitimate ASes. We show that some of these behavioral
patterns are clearly visible when studying announcement
dynamics of networks over long time periods.
• Based on these behavioral patterns, we propose a set of met-
rics and we use a machine-learning model to evaluate their
applicability to the problem of automatically identifying
ASes with BGP origination patterns similar to serial hijack-
ers. Our classifier flags ≈ 900 ASes that exhibit characteristics
similar to our ground truth serial hijackers. We provide a de-
tailed analysis of these preliminary results, revealing insight
into false positives, actual malicious activity, as well as ASes
appearing as illegitimately originating prefixes because of
third-party misconfigurations.
• We illuminate behavioral patterns of serial hijackers in the
wild with three case studies featuring a known serial hijacker,
and two newly identified ones: a detailed analysis of multiple
years of hijacking activity by AS197426, a glaring case of
a serial hijacker from our ground truth dataset; AS19529, a
hijacker network that was detected by our classifier, where
we found corroborating evidence of hijacks; and AS134190,
the network that, among the ASes we identify, shows the
most recent indications of potential serial hijacker behavior.
This work shows that, through analysis of readily available pub-
lic BGP data—without leveraging blacklists or other indicators—it
is possible to identify dominant patterns of serial hijackers. Our
preliminary results suggest that these patterns can be leveraged in
automated applications, potentially revealing undetected behavior
or generating a novel category of reputation scores. Our findings
have thus relevance for the operator community, since they can aid
network operators to identify suspicious ASes a priori, potentially
allowing for preventive defense. Our findings are also of relevance
to the broader research community, since they provide viable in-
put for new prefix hijacking detection systems, as well as for the
development of AS reputation metrics and scoring systems.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the
long-term characteristics of this important category of networks,
serial hijacker ASes. We make the feature dataset and the results
of this work publicly available to allow both for reproducibility
and for other works to leverage our list of identified ASes.1 While
the majority of hijacker ASes only target the IPv4 space, we show
metrics both for IPv4 and IPv6.

com) over the course of 5 years. This AS originates prefixes
consistently over long time periods.

canal) over the course of almost 3 years. This AS announces
a large number of prefixes over short time periods.

nated prefix as a row on the y-axis and color prefixes by their

fixes numerically and show time (3-5 years) on the y-axis.
2 BACKGROUND
To bootstrap our analysis, we first introduce the serial hijacker
network type, and illustrate some of its pertinent characteristics
by example. We review related work in the field of hijack detection
and network profiling, and present a roadmap for this paper.
2.1 Introducing Serial Hijackers
Since as of today, no reliable and widely deployed system to au-
tomatically discard illegitimate BGP route announcements exists,
the network operator community frequently relies on mailing lists
(e.g., NANOG [6]) to exchange information about illegitimate BGP
announcements and to coordinate efforts to limit their propagation
and impact by blocking announcements from networks originating
such prefixes. The key observation that motivates this work came
from studying 5 years of threads from operator mailing lists: many

reported hijacks are not “one-off” events, where a previously un-
known AS number starts to advertise prefixes. Instead, we often
find reports of the very same ASes repeatedly carrying out prefix
hijacks. In fact, some of these networks continue to hijack different
prefixes over the course of multiple years. Figure 1b shows a visual-
ization of the origination activity of AS3266, a network that was
repeatedly reported to hijack address space. We see that, over the
course of 3 years, this AS originated almost 1,200 unique prefixes,
and we observe a highly irregular pattern of short-lived origina-
tion of disparate address blocks. To put this behavior in contrast,
we show the origination activity of AS5400 (British Telecom) in
Figure 1a. This network, a large British residential and mobile ISP,
shows a much more steady pattern, longer prefix announcement
times, and an overall constant, and monotonically increasing num-
ber of advertised prefixes. We note, however, that also legitimate
ASes can exhibit irregular patterns (see the white space between
lines indicating a prefix was not originated at that time), often due
to configuration issues of the network in question or of third-party
ASes. Thus, metrics and systems attempting to isolate ASes with
potentially malicious behavior must be chosen and evaluated care-
fully to allow for robustness. From Figure 1 it becomes clear that
these two networks show wildly different long-term behavior in
the global routing table. The goal of this paper is to identify and
scrutinize the dominant prefix origination characteristics of this
important class of networks: serial hijackers.
2.2 Related Work
BGP vulnerabilities and hijacks have been studied for a long time
[10, 13, 36, 37, 52]. However, proposals to secure BGP have not
gained widespread traction. Even though the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) standardized BGP prefix origin authorization and
validation many years ago [29, 30, 47], deployment in production
networks is still limited [16, 18]. As a result, BGP hijacks are a
prevalent threat and concern for network operators [48]. There have
been many efforts in the research community to characterize BGP
hijacking events [28, 56] and to develop hijack detection systems
using different approaches, metrics, and vantage points [22, 27, 42,
43, 46, 49, 50, 57]. While most systems focus on detecting individual
BGP hijacking events, some attempt to identify the source of the
cause and a few even tackle mitigation and remediation [7].
In contrast to most earlier works on BGP hijacks, our approach
works by profiling the network-wide BGP prefix origination behav-
ior of ASes. Few previous works study network-wide behavior of
malicious actors. In [45], the authors study BGP announcements
dynamics of prefixes found in email spam blacklists. They find
that some spammers use short-lived (a few minutes long) BGP
route announcements of large address blocks to send spam from IP
addresses scattered throughout the advertised prefix. In [51], the
authors study ASes that are over-represented in blacklists of phish-
ing, scam, spam, malware and exploited hosts. Analyzing a month
of BGP data, they find that these ASes are more likely to become
unreachable and that they have more changes in their connectivity
than most ASes in the Internet. Konte et al. [25] developed a system
to identify bulletproof hosting ASes, leveraging features such as
frequent re-wiring of transit interconnections. Our work is comple-
mentary in that we do focus on a specific group of malicious ASes,
serial hijackers. We focus exclusively on behavioral characteristics
related to their BGP origination patterns (i.e., we do not leverage
any data other than BGP for our classification), and specifically
study long-term behavior of networks.
2.3 Roadmap
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in § 3 we first describe
how we build a ground-truth dataset of serial hijacker ASes, as well
as a control set of legitimate ASes. We also introduce our longitudi-
nal dataset that covers 5 years of BGP activity at a 5-minute gran-
ularity. We introduce necessary data cleaning and preprocessing
steps in § 4. In § 5, we first introduce a set of behavioral character-
istics and pose hypotheses on how the behavior of serial hijacker
ASes might differ from legitimate ASes. For each category, we in-
troduce different metrics to capture AS behavior and study in detail
how serial hijackers’ BGP origination behavior differs from legiti-
mate ASes in our ground-truth dataset and how our metrics capture
these differences. With our metrics in hand, in § 6 we proceed and
train a machine-learning model to identify networks in the global
routing table exhibiting similar behavior to serial hijacker ASes.
In § 7, we present a broad and detailed study of the ≈ 900 networks
flagged by our classifier “in the wild”. Finally, we feature three net-
works in case studies in § 8, and discuss implications and limitations
of our work as well as avenues for future work in § 9.
3 DATASETS
In this section we first describe the datasets we leverage for identi-
fying serial hijackers and a control group of legitimate ASes. We
then introduce our longitudinal BGP dataset.
3.1 Legitimate ASes and Serial Hijackers
Legitimate ASes: We start our selection of legitimate ASes using
the participants to the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Secu-
rity (MANRS) initiative [5]. MANRS is a global initiative started by
network operators and supported by the Internet Society, which
proposes a set of actions, such as filtering and global validation of
Internet resources, that network operators can implement to foster
routing security. Since MANRS participants voluntarily agree to im-
plement a set of proactive security measures in BGP, it is unlikely
that they would repeatedly—and willingly—engage in repeated
BGP misbehavior or malicious activities. 272 ASes2 are part of the
MANRS initiative. Additionally, we manually select 35 ASes that
represent the full spectrum of routed ASes: major end-user ISPs, en-
