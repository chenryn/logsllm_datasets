## Abstract
BGP hijacks remain a significant issue in today’s Internet, with widespread consequences. While hijack detection systems are readily available, they typically rely on a priori prefix-ownership information and are reactive in nature. In this work, we take a new perspective on BGP hijacking activity by introducing and tracking the long-term routing behavior of serial hijackers—networks that repeatedly hijack address blocks for malicious purposes over months or even years. Using a ground truth dataset constructed from network operator mailing lists, we identify the dominant routing characteristics of serial hijackers and how they differ from legitimate networks. We then distill features that capture these behavioral differences and train a machine learning model to automatically identify Autonomous Systems (ASes) with similar characteristics. Our classifier identifies approximately 900 ASes in the global IPv4 routing table. We analyze and categorize these networks, finding a wide range of indicators of malicious activity, misconfiguration, and benign hijacking. This work represents a significant step towards identifying and understanding this important category of networks, which can aid network operators in taking proactive measures to defend against prefix hijacking and serve as input for current and future detection systems.

## 1. Introduction
The lack of route authentication and validation in BGP remains a critical problem in today's Internet. The absence of basic origin validation for route announcements not only makes the Internet more susceptible to connectivity issues due to misconfigurations but also opens the door for malicious actors. Recent reports highlight the severity of this problem, including widespread connectivity issues due to BGP misconfigurations and hijacking events targeting popular destinations on the Internet. These incidents range from simpler attacks aimed at sending spam emails to more sophisticated misuse of BGP to intercept traffic or steal cryptocurrencies.

While the operator and research communities have invested substantial resources in improving BGP security, such as the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), little has changed in production environments. Operators can use monitoring services to detect potential hijacks of their prefix announcements, but these systems are typically reactive and event-based. They rely on assumptions of prefix ownership and track origin changes in the global routing table. If an event is detected, the victim network can attempt to contact the perpetrator or its upstream networks to resolve the issue. However, such contact is often unfruitful or impossible, leaving victims with the option of publicly disclosing the event in network operator mailing lists, hoping for peer pressure and manual interventions to remediate the situation.

Most BGP hijack detection systems are reactive and event-based, but malicious BGP behavior by an actor can be consistent over time, creating opportunities for methods based on longitudinal analysis. We find that many hijacking events disclosed in operator mailing lists and network security blogs involve malicious ASes that repeatedly hijack prefixes. Some of these ASes show malicious activity in the global routing table for multiple years, and we refer to them as serial hijackers. Despite their ongoing threat, serial hijackers have received surprisingly little attention in terms of empirical assessment.

In this paper, we provide a systematic empirical analysis of the behavioral characteristics of serial hijacker ASes. Instead of focusing on individual BGP hijacking events, we study the long-term prefix advertisement dynamics in the global routing table. Our main contributions include:
- A detailed and longitudinal study of BGP announcement dynamics of serial hijacker ASes over five years.
- Identification of key attributes that broadly capture the behavior of serial hijacker ASes, highlighting several interesting and previously undocumented cases.
- A set of metrics and a machine learning model to evaluate their applicability in automatically identifying ASes with BGP origination patterns similar to serial hijackers.
- Case studies featuring known and newly identified serial hijackers, providing insights into false positives, actual malicious activity, and ASes appearing as illegitimate due to third-party misconfigurations.

Our findings suggest that it is possible to identify dominant patterns of serial hijackers through the analysis of readily available public BGP data. These patterns can be leveraged in automated applications, potentially revealing undetected behavior or generating a novel category of reputation scores. Our results are relevant for the operator community, aiding in the identification of suspicious ASes and enabling preventive defense. They also provide viable input for new prefix hijacking detection systems and the development of AS reputation metrics and scoring systems.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work focusing on the long-term characteristics of serial hijacker ASes. We make our feature dataset and results publicly available to ensure reproducibility and to allow other researchers to leverage our list of identified ASes. While most hijacker ASes target the IPv4 space, we present metrics for both IPv4 and IPv6.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Introducing Serial Hijackers
Since there is no reliable and widely deployed system to automatically discard illegitimate BGP route announcements, the network operator community frequently relies on mailing lists (e.g., NANOG) to exchange information about illegitimate BGP announcements and coordinate efforts to limit their propagation and impact. Our key observation came from studying five years of threads from operator mailing lists: many reported hijacks are not one-off events. Instead, we often find reports of the same ASes repeatedly carrying out prefix hijacks. Some of these networks continue to hijack different prefixes over multiple years. Figure 1b visualizes the origination activity of AS3266, a network repeatedly reported to hijack address space. Over three years, this AS originated almost 1,200 unique prefixes, showing a highly irregular pattern of short-lived origination of disparate address blocks. In contrast, Figure 1a shows the origination activity of AS5400 (British Telecom), a large British residential and mobile ISP, which exhibits a steady pattern with longer prefix announcement times and a monotonically increasing number of advertised prefixes. While legitimate ASes can also exhibit irregular patterns due to configuration issues, the long-term behavior of serial hijackers and legitimate ASes in the global routing table is markedly different.

### 2.2 Related Work
BGP vulnerabilities and hijacks have been studied extensively, but proposals to secure BGP have not gained widespread traction. Even though the IETF standardized BGP prefix origin authorization and validation many years ago, deployment in production networks is still limited. As a result, BGP hijacks remain a prevalent threat. There have been numerous efforts to characterize BGP hijacking events and develop detection systems using various approaches, metrics, and vantage points. While most systems focus on detecting individual BGP hijacking events, some attempt to identify the source and a few tackle mitigation and remediation.

Our approach differs from most earlier works by profiling the network-wide BGP prefix origination behavior of ASes. Few previous works study network-wide behavior of malicious actors. For example, some studies have found that spammers use short-lived BGP route announcements to send spam from IP addresses scattered throughout the advertised prefix. Other studies have found that ASes over-represented in blacklists of phishing, scam, spam, malware, and exploited hosts are more likely to become unreachable and have more changes in their connectivity than most ASes. Our work complements these studies by focusing on a specific group of malicious ASes, serial hijackers, and exclusively on their BGP origination patterns.

## 3. Datasets
### 3.1 Legitimate ASes and Serial Hijackers
#### Legitimate ASes
We start by selecting legitimate ASes from participants in the Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) initiative. MANRS is a global initiative supported by the Internet Society, which proposes actions such as filtering and global validation of Internet resources to foster routing security. Since MANRS participants agree to implement proactive security measures, it is unlikely that they would engage in repeated BGP misbehavior. 272 ASes are part of the MANRS initiative. Additionally, we manually select 35 ASes representing the full spectrum of routed ASes, including major end-user ISPs, enterprise networks, and content delivery networks.

#### Serial Hijackers
To build a ground truth dataset of serial hijackers, we extract information from network operator mailing lists, focusing on ASes repeatedly reported for hijacking activities over multiple years. This dataset forms the basis for our analysis and serves as a reference for training our machine learning model.

### 3.2 Longitudinal BGP Dataset
We use a longitudinal BGP dataset covering five years of BGP activity at a 5-minute granularity. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of BGP announcements and allows us to study the long-term behavior of ASes in the global routing table.

## 4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before analyzing the data, we perform necessary cleaning and preprocessing steps. This includes removing duplicate entries, handling missing data, and normalizing the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy in our analysis.

## 5. Behavioral Characteristics and Hypotheses
We introduce a set of behavioral characteristics and pose hypotheses on how the behavior of serial hijacker ASes might differ from legitimate ASes. For each category, we introduce different metrics to capture AS behavior and study in detail how serial hijackers' BGP origination behavior differs from legitimate ASes in our ground-truth dataset. We then evaluate how well our metrics capture these differences.

## 6. Machine Learning Model
With our metrics in hand, we train a machine learning model to identify networks in the global routing table exhibiting similar behavior to serial hijacker ASes. The model is trained on the ground truth dataset and validated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and generalizability.

## 7. Analysis of Flagged Networks
We present a broad and detailed study of the ≈ 900 networks flagged by our classifier. This analysis includes a breakdown of the types of networks, their geographic distribution, and the indicators of malicious activity, misconfiguration, and benign hijacking. We also discuss the implications of these findings for network operators and the broader research community.

## 8. Case Studies
We feature three networks in case studies to provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of serial hijackers. These case studies include a known serial hijacker and two newly identified ones, providing insights into their long-term behavior and the effectiveness of our classification approach.

## 9. Discussion and Future Work
We discuss the implications and limitations of our work and explore avenues for future research. This includes the potential for integrating our findings into existing and future BGP security mechanisms, the development of AS reputation metrics, and the need for further empirical studies on the long-term behavior of malicious actors in the global routing table.
