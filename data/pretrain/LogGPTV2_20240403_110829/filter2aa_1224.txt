During Penetration Testing
INTRODUCTION
 From Dayton Ohio region
 Last 18 years in IT
 10 year in security
 3 of those as a security penetration tester
 Member of foofus.net team
 3rd time presenting at Defcon   w00t!
AGENDA
 Multi function printer features 
 Multi function printer security
 Attacking multi function printer devices
 Leveraging these attacks during pentesting
 Development of an automated harvesting tool
 Conclusion & Question
MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER 
FEATURES
MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER FEATURES
 Scan to File
 Window file server access
 FTP server access
 Scan to Email
 Email server SMTP access
 Email Notification
 Email server SMTP access
MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER FEATURES
 LDAP authentication services
 User address books
 System logging
 Remote functionality
 Backup/cloning
MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER 
SECURITY
MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER SECURITY 
Four steps to security failure
 Roll it in and power it up 
 Integrate with business systems 
 Passwords
 No password set
 Factory default setting
 No patch management
ATTACKING 
MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER 
DEVICES
ATTACKING MULTI FUNCTION PRINTERS
 Why
 Gather information
 Escalation rights into other core systems
 When 
 If exposed to internet 
 Once you gain a foot hold into internal network
ATTACKING MULTI FUNCTION PRINTERS
 How
 Leveraging default password
 Access bypass attacks
 Information leakage attacks
 Forceful browsing attacks
 Backup/cloning functions
 Passback attack
MFP SECURITY BYPASS ATTACK
 The ability to bypass authentication on a device 
by passing various forms of data in the URL
 Toshiba
 HP
/TopAccess/Administrator/Setup/ScanToFile/List.htm
Redirects to /TopAccess/Administrator/Login/Login.htm
TOSHIBA  BYPASS ATTACK

DEMO
MFP INFORMATION LEAKAGE ATTACKS
 MFP devices exposing data unintentionally. Data of 
value can typically be extracted from web page source 
code.
 Toshiba
 Canon
 HP
 Sharp

TOSHIBA INFORMATION LEAKAGE ATTACK
HP INFORMATION LEAKAGE ATTACK
MFP FORCED BROWSING ATTACK
 Access to web pages and files are gained by just 
knowing the correct URL path
 Not uncommon to find that embedded devices 
such as printers correctly secure files with 
extensions of
cgi
htm 
html 
 But may allow access to other file types
CANON FORCED BROWSING 
 Canon ImageRunners address books can be retrieved 
through forceful browsing
 Once a valid cookie is gained the address books can 
be retrieved without authenticating
 A valid cookie is gained by accessing 
the printers home page
 Fails on devices with a Product Name  
 ir3580
 ir4080
CANON FORCED BROWSING 
 Force browse to address books
 abook.ldif
 abook.abk
 imagerunners have by default up to 11 address books
Increment up to gain access to all address books 
CANON FORCED BROWSING 
MFP PASSBACK ATTACK
 Passback attack
 An attack where the MFP device is tricked into 
communicating with the attacker, versus communicating 
with its standard configured services
 Number of printers have test functions for testing LDAP 
configuration setups
 May also be possible on other services
MFP PASSBACK ATTACK
Printer
LDAP
Server
Attacker
LDAP Test Button
Auth to 
LDAP
Change LDAP 
server IP Setting
LDAP Test Button
LDAP auth to 
attacker
SHARP PASSBACK ATTACK
 Sharp MX series support these test 
functions for: 
 LDAP
 SMTP
 Attacker can send all setting within 
HTTP(s) post request
 If password is left at *******  
then stored password is used
SHARP PASSBACK ATTACK
SHARP PASSBACK ATTACK
 Post values of interest
 Server IP  Address
 (ggt_textbox(21)
 AUTH TYPE 
 ggt_select(25) 
 PORT Number
 ggt_hidden(30)  
SHARP PASSBACK ATTACK
RICOH PASSBACK ATTACK
 Similar issue at the Sharp 
printers
 Easily tricked in passing data 
back to the attacker

MFP BACKUP/CLONING
 Extracted information from backup data
 A number of MFP devices provide a method to 
backup/clone  system configuration
 This function prides a method to quickly deploy 
multiple devices throughout an organization 
without needing physical access to each devices
CANON BACKUP EXPORT
 Additional functions export
 Usermode.umd
 http://MFP/usermode.umd
 Usermode.umd is a data file but 
does contain ascii

‘PRAEDA’  
BUILDING AN AUTOMATED 
HARVESTING  TOOL 
‘PRAEDA’  AUTOMATED HARVESTING  TOOL
 PRAEDA  latin for “plunder, spoils of war, 
booty”
 Tool designed to gather information from web 
interfaces on printers
 Present version written in Perl
‘PRAEDA’  AUTOMATED HARVESTING  TOOL
 Present version 
 16 modules
 Extract data from 39 different printers models

‘PRAEDA’  AUTOMATED HARVESTING  TOOL
Data file (DATA_LIST)
 1st field (P000032)  = sequence number
 2nd field (Top Page – MX-2600N)  = Title page
 3rd field (Rapid Logic/1.1)  = Server type
 4th field (MP0014) = Module to execute
‘PRAEDA’  AUTOMATED HARVESTING  TOOL
DISPATCHER (PRAEDA.PL)
 Syntax
“praeda.pl TARGET_FILE TCP_PORT PROJECT_NAME OUTPUT_FILE (-ssl)”
 Queries printers in target list
 If a match is found in data_list  module jobs 
listed in 4th column are executed
 Recovered data is stored in logs file or separate 
extract files under project name
‘PRAEDA’  AUTOMATED HARVESTING  TOOL
Praeda project moving forward
 Continue researching encryption methods used by some vendors for 
backup and clone process outputs
 HP 
 Xerox
 Working migrating code to Ruby – early stages of 
conversion started
 Will continue developing in Perl for the moment
 Looking for contributors for project
 Develop other network appliance modules besides printers –
plan to release a half dozen or more modules next month
