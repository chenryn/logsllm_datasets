Abstract—We consider stochastic models in presence of uncer-
tainty, originating from lack of knowledge of parameters or by
unpredictable effects of the environment. We focus on population
processes, encompassing a large class of systems, from queueing
networks to epidemic spreading. We set up a formal framework
for imprecise stochastic processes, where some parameters are
allowed to vary in time within a given domain, but with no
further constraint. We then consider the limit behaviour of
these systems as the population size goes to inﬁnity. We prove
that this limit is given by a differential
inclusion that can
be constructed from the (imprecise) drift. We provide results
both for the transient and the steady state behaviour. Finally,
we discuss different approaches to compute bounds of the so-
obtained differential inclusions, proposing an effective control-
theoretic method based on Pontryagin principle for transient
bounds. This provides an efﬁcient approach for the analysis and
design of large-scale uncertain and imprecise stochastic models.
The theoretical results are accompanied by an in-depth analysis
of an epidemic model and a queueing network. These examples
demonstrate the applicability of the numerical methods and the
tightness of the approximation.

INTRODUCTION
The complexity of the world prevents us to describe all
its aspects with full precision. Lack of knowledge and limited
computational and intellectual resources force any description
of a complex behaviour to be imprecise and uncertain to a
certain degree. This is true also when we try to construct
mathematical models of complex systems, in domains as di-
verse as telecommunication, molecular biology, epidemiology.
Probabilistic models are one way of representing uncertainties
but they depend on parameters which values are never known
precisely, and can possibly be estimated from data only with
a certain degree of imprecision. Furthermore, mathematical
models of systems cannot provide an explicit description of
the environment, which always inﬂuences the behaviour in
uncontrollable ways.
As a typical example, consider a model of epidemic
spreading in a population, for instance a model of disease
spreading in humans [1] or of a malware spreading in a
computer network [2]. The infection rate is a typical parameter
of such models which can hardly be known exactly, and is
usually estimated from available data about the initial outbreak
of the epidemic [1]. However, statistical estimation can never

provide an exact value, as we have at disposal only a ﬁnite, and
often insufﬁcient, amount of data. Moreover, the infection rate
itself may depend on environmental factors, which can change
arbitrarily in time. For instance, in cholera spreading [3], the
level of rainfall impacts on the diffusion of the bacterium
among nearby water reservoirs, leading to infection rates which
can vary unpredictably in time.
Another example is provided by sociotechnical systems
such as bike sharing systems. In such as system, users can
pick up or return bikes at any station of their choice. The
arrival rate of users in a bike station cannot be assumed ﬁxed
during the day, but it will depend on the current hour. The
precise form of such a dependency is unknown, as it will be
inﬂuenced by several factors like the weather, the status of
public transportation, the presence of events in the city. Even
if we restrict to a small time frame, like the rush hour in the
morning, so that we can assume a constant arrival rate, such
a rate cannot be reliably ﬁxed to a precise value, but should
rather be assumed to lie in an interval of possible values.
In this paper, we distinguish two models of uncertainties
Imprecision: Some parameters ϑ can depend on features of
the environment external to the model (like temperature, atmo-
spheric weather, and so on,). ϑ may be subject to variations
during the time horizon T of interest, so that considering it as
a ﬁxed parameter is an incorrect assumption that can lead to
incorrect results. One way to capture such a variability, without
committing to assumptions on the form of dependency of ϑ
on the external / environmental factors, is to ﬁx a set Θ of
possible values for ϑ and assume that ϑ depends on time t
and can take any value of Θ at any time instant, i.e. ϑt ∈ Θ.
Essentially, ϑt plays a role similar to inputs in control theory.
We call this the imprecise scenario.
Uncertainty: In a simpler scenario, a parameter ϑ is assumed
ﬁxed, but its precise value is not known precisely. In this case,
we assume that ϑ ∈ Θ, where Θ is the possible set of values of
ϑ, as above. This will be referred to as the uncertain scenario.
In this paper, we focus our attention on models of large
populations of interacting agents, formalised in terms of con-
tinuous time Markov chains (CTMC), introducing a new class
of models, called imprecise population processes, which are
able to capture the intrinsic uncertainty of the world. In these
models, we assume that some parameters can vary in an un-
constrained way within a certain range. This non-deterministic
variation represents all possible ways the external environment
can inﬂuence the value of these parameters, and is a model of

the imprecise scenario described above. We also distinguish a
simpler case, in which parameters are assumed to be ﬁxed, i.e.
not inﬂuenced by the environment, but unknown. In this case,
the class of population models so obtained is considerably
simpler, resulting in the so-called uncertain continuous time
Markov chains, see [4].
When populations are large, as is often the case in epi-
demiology, biology, telecommunications, a direct analysis of
the stochastic model is unfeasible, even by restricting to a
statistical treatment of simulations. A viable alternative is to
construct the so-called mean ﬁeld approximation [5], which
provides a deterministic description of the behaviour to which
stochastic trajectories converge in the limit of inﬁnite popula-
tions.
The complexity of the analysis is further exacerbated by the
presence of imprecision or uncertainty. The main contribution
of this paper is to provide a characterisation of mean-ﬁeld
limits for imprecise population processes (and a-fortiori for
uncertain CTMCs) in terms of differential inclusions (DI, [6]),
both for transient and steady-state behaviour (when this is
meaningful). We investigate the computational gains obtained
in this way. With respect to classic mean ﬁeld, the presence of
imprecision increases the computational cost of analysis also
for the mean-ﬁeld limits, as we have to deal with differential
inclusions. In the paper, we also present a novel method to
bound the solutions of DI using control theoretic tools, namely
the Pontraygin principle [7, Section 3].
These results pave the way to novel and efﬁcient computa-
tional methods to analyse, design, and eventually control large
scale systems of interacting agents, taking both uncertainty
in parameter speciﬁcation and imprecision due to external
effects consistently into account. For instance, we can design
patching (or vaccination) strategy to counteract an epidemic
which is effective even if the infection rate changes in time in
unpredictable ways.
The paper is organised as follows: Section II discusses
Imprecise Markov Chains and the evolution of their probability
mass in terms of differential inclusions. Section III introduces
imprecise population models and proves their mean ﬁeld
behaviour. Section IV discusses computational methods for the
analysis of the differential inclusion mean ﬁeld limits. Section
V works out in detail an example about epidemic spreading,
while Section VI discusses a generalised processor sharing
scenario. The ﬁnal discussion is in Section VII.
Related work: Following the terminology of [8], the
models developed in our paper combine two ways for repre-
senting uncertainties: a “stochastic uncertainty”, driven by a
Markovian behaviour, and a “contingent uncertainty”, given
by possibly changing parameters. This approach is similar to
the notion on stochastic differential inclusion studied in [8],
[9], where the “stochastic uncertainty” is driven by a Wiener
process while the “contingent uncertainty” is given by a set-
valued map. Our work also builds on [10], that considers
Markov chain with interval probabilities. The key contribution
of our paper with respect to [10] is to extend this notions
to population process and to develop a rigorous mean-ﬁeld
approximation of such systems.
Mean ﬁeld approximation of population processes has a
long history, starting from the works of Kurtz [11], [12]. Mean
ﬁeld based analysis, for the transient and the steady state, have
been applied in performance modelling and model-checking
tools [13], [14], systems biology, epidemiology [5]. For a
gentle introduction, see [15].
Classic mean ﬁeld results require (Lipschitz) continuity
of rate functions, but more general theorems can be proved
for piecewise smooth rates [16] or even general discontinuous
functions by using differential inclusions [17]. The proof of
most of our convergence results are based on the construction
of a proper stochastic approximation. They are similar to the
ones of [17], [18]. For clarity and brevity, we will only give
sketches of proofs.
Note that the main technical contribution of this paper is
to properly deﬁne the mean-ﬁeld framework for uncertainties,
in a way that makes feasible the adaptation of proofs from
stochastic approximation by differential inclusions [18].

IMPRECISE MARKOV CHAINS
In this section we ﬁrst discuss imprecise continuous-time
Markov chains in general. Population processes are a subclass
of this general model. We will introduce the imprecise and the
uncertain models. We will then introduce brieﬂy differential
inclusions, and show how Kolmogorov equations for the
probability mass generalise to differential inclusions in this
setting. We also introduce the imprecise drift of an imprecise
model, which will play a central role in the construction of
mean ﬁeld limits.
A. Imprecise and uncertain Markov chains
We consider a stochastic process X = (Xt)t≥0 that takes
value in a discrete state space E ⊂ R
d and that is adapted
to a ﬁltration1 F. The dynamics of the process depends on
a parameter (or a vector of parameters) ϑ. We denote by Θ
the set of possible parameter values of ϑ. We consider a set
of transitions kernel Qϑ on E, parametrized by ϑ ∈ Θ: For
(cid:2)
x,y ≥ 0 for x (cid:5)= y ∈ E and
each ϑ ∈ Θ, Qϑ is such that Qϑ
y∈E Qϑ
xy = 0.
Deﬁnition 1. An imprecise continuous time Markov chain is
a stochastic process X together with a Ft-adapted process θ
such that for all t ≥ 0:
The deﬁnition of an imprecise Markov chain makes no
restriction on the set of processes that the varying parameter
θ can take. In some cases, it can be interesting to focus on
subset of processes. An example is if we assume that ϑt is
deterministic and constant in time. In that case we obtain the
notion of uncertain Markov chain:
Deﬁnition 2. An uncertain continuous time Markov chain
is a stochastic process X such that there exists a constant
parameter ϑ ∈ Θ such that for all t ≥ 0:

h→0
P(Xt+h = y | Ft, Xt = x) =

if x = y
1A ﬁltration is a set of σ-algebra (Ft)t≥0 such that Fs ⊂ Ft ⊂ F for
each t ≥ s ≥ 0. X is adapted to F means that Xt is Ft measurable for
every t.

in the imprecise case,
The deﬁnitions of imprecise and uncertain CTMC cor-
respond to two extreme cases:
the
parameter function θ can be any measurable function while
in the uncertain case the parameter function θ is deterministic
and constant in time. It would be possible to consider cases
in between, for example by restricting the set of admissible
processes θ to be the set of functions that only depends on
the value X(t) – such process θ are called Markovian control
policies in the Markov decision processes community – or the
set of time-dependent deterministic functions – which would
lead to time-inhomogeneous CTMC.
Remark:
Imprecise CTMC are strongly related to
(continuous-time) Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) [19],
the main difference being that in MDPs, the emphasis is on
ﬁnding a policy that maximises some reward criteria. To to this,
one usually assumes a ﬁnite or countable number of actions
that can be taken non-deterministically. In ICTMC, the vari-
ability of the decision variables is usually not controllable and
can be a generic random function adapted to the process. The
parameter space is in general uncountable and our objective
is to characterise the set of possible behaviours. Uncertainty,
in the sense considered here, has been considered also in the
MDS context, in the so called Uncertain (Bounded-Parameter)
MDPs [20], [21].

, ϑmax
Example: For illustrative purposes, we consider a sim-
ple model of a bike sharing system, similar to the one of [22].
We describe the number of bikes present in a single station,
so that the state of the CTMC is given by Xt ∈ {0, . . . , N},
where N is the capacity of the station, i.e. the maximum
number of bikes. We assume that customers arrive at an
unknown rate ϑa, belonging to the interval [ϑmin
]. Each
customer arrival brings the system from state k to k − 1 (for
k > 0). Similarly, we can model the return of a bike as a
, ϑmax
transition with rate ϑr, belonging to the interval [ϑmin
],
and increasing the number of available bikes from k to k + 1,
provided k < N. Different choices of how the two imprecise
parameters can vary give rise to different models. In the general
case, we can assume that ϑa(t) and ϑr(t) are generic functions
of time, encoding complex but unknown dependencies of the
environment of customers requesting a bike and wishing to
return it at the station. On the opposite spectrum, we could
assume that these values are unknown but constant in time,
for example if we are considering the dynamics of the station
in a restricted time frame.

B. Differential inclusions
Differential inclusions (DI) are a generalisation of differ-
ential equations, and provide the natural mathematical tool to
describe the transient evolution of the probability mass of an
imprecise CTMC. Furthermore, as we will see in the next
section, under a proper scaling, the behaviour of an imprecise
Markov chain is closely related to the one of a differential
inclusion corresponding to Equation (3). In this section, we
provide a quick introduction to DI, recalling some classical
deﬁnitions. See [6] for further details.
d that assigns to
each x ∈ E a set of vectors F (x) ⊂ R
d. A solution to the
differential inclusion ˙x ∈ F (x) that starts in x is a function
x : [0,∞) → E such that there exists a measurable function
Let F be a set-valued function on E ⊂ R
289
f : [0,∞) → R
d satisfying: for all t ≥ 0 f (t) ∈ F (x(t)) and
(cid:4) t
x(t) = x0 +
f (s)ds.
0
For an initial condition x0, we denote by SF,x0 (or Sx0
if there is no ambiguity) the set of solutions of ˙x ∈ F (x)
that start in x0. Note that the set SF,x0 can be empty or be
composed of multiple solutions, depending on the function
d, a sufﬁcient condition for the existence
F . When E = R
of at least one solution is that (a) for all x ∈ R
d F (x) is
non-empty, convex and bounded (i.e., supx∈X,y∈F (x) (cid:8)y(cid:8) <
∞) and (b) F is upper-semi-continuous (i.e., the graph of F ,
{(x, y), y ∈ F (x)}, is a closed set).
Asymptotic behaviour as t goes to inﬁnity: As the time
grows, a solution x of a differential inclusion can have a
chaotic behaviour and can oscillate around many points. For a
given starting point x0, we deﬁne the limit set LF (x0) as the
closure of the set of points that are accumulation points of at
least one solution of the differential inclusion starting in x0:
(cid:5)
x∈SF,x0
(cid:6)
t≥0
LF (x0) :=
closure({x(s), s ≥ t}),
where closure denotes the closure in the metric space R
d.
As in [18], we call the Birkhoff centre of the differential
inclusion is the closure of the set of recurrent points of the
differential inclusion:
BF = closure({x ∈ E : x ∈ LF (x)}).
(1)
Intuitively, the Birkhoff centre contains all attractors, equilib-
ria, limit cycles, and in general all points that can be visited
inﬁnitely often by one solution of the differential inclusion. As
such, it provides a characterisation of the localisation in the
phase space of the limit behaviour of the system. Note that, in
general, the sets LF (x) and BF are not convex nor necessarily
connected, even when F (x) is single valued and Lipschitz (for
example the Birkhoff centre of F (x) = {x(1 − x)} is {0, 1}).
Note that even if the case of Lipschitz ordinary differential
equation, the computation of the Birkhoff centre of an ODE
is complicated and even its shape can depend strongly on
the parameter of the function (see the comparison between
Figure 1 and Figure 2 of [5]).
C. Imprecise Kolmogorov Equations
The time evolution of the probability mass of an imprecise
Markov chain can be obtained by a generalised version of
Kolmogorov equations, stated in terms of differential
in-
clusions. For a ﬁxed realisation ϑt of the process ϑ,
the
evolution of the probability mass P (t | ϑt) is given by the
standard (non-autonomous) Kolmogorov (forward) equations
˙P (t | ϑt) = Qϑt·P (t | ϑt). However, if we have no knowledge
on the process ϑ, we can only assume that the process at time
t behaves like a Qϑ for some ϑ, implying that the transient
behaviour of the probability mass will be a solution of the
differential inclusion
˙P (t) ∈ Q · P (t),
(cid:7)
(2)
ϑ∈Θ Qϑ. Equation (2) is linear, but the dimension
where Q =
of the differential inclusion equals the size of the state space,
which is too large in most interesting scenarios, especially for
population models, see Section III.

D. Generalised Drift
An important notion associated with an imprecise Markov
chain is that of drift, which extends the corresponding notion
for CTMCs, and describes the average increment in a point of
the state space, as a function of the imprecise parameters.
Deﬁnition 3. The imprecise drift of the imprecise CTMC is
the function f : E × Θ → R

f (x, ϑ) =
y∈E
x,y(y − x).

When for all x ∈ E, ϑ ∈ Θ we have
∞, the sum in Equation (3) is well deﬁned.

IMPRECISE POPULATION PROCESSES
In this section we introduce the class of models of interest
in this paper, namely imprecise population processes. Popula-
tion processes are a very common class of models, and when
relaxing the precision intrinsic in their deﬁnition, Imprecise
population processes emerge naturally. After providing the
deﬁnition, we shift the focus to the behaviour of imprecise
population processes in the limit of an inﬁnite population. We
show that such a limit is described by a differential inclusion,
which provides also information about the stationary behaviour
of the imprecise process, encoded in the Birkhoff centre.
A. Deﬁnition
Let N be a scaling parameter (typically, N is the popula-
tion size of the considered model). We consider a sequence of
imprecise Markov processes indexed by N, denoted (XN )N≥0
on a sequence of subset EN ⊂ E ⊂ R
d. The stochastic process
XN is an imprecise process of kernel QN,θ and X N (t) denotes
the state of the process at time t.
Deﬁnition 4. An imprecise (respectively uncertain) population
