I have created a Docker image that includes Python libraries and Jupyter. When I start the container, I use the `-p 8888:8888` option to map the ports between the host and the container. After launching a Jupyter kernel inside the container with the `jupyter notebook` command, it runs on `localhost:8888` but cannot find a browser.

From my host machine, what IP address should I use to access Jupyter in my host's web browser? When I run the `ifconfig` command, I see interfaces such as `eth0`, `docker0`, `wlan0`, and `lo`.

To access the Jupyter notebook from your host machine, you need to ensure that Jupyter is listening on all available network interfaces within the container. You can do this by running the following command inside the container:

```sh
jupyter notebook --allow-root --ip=0.0.0.0
```

This command will make Jupyter accessible on all IP addresses of the container. 

Next, to connect to the Jupyter notebook from your host machine, you need to use the IP address of the host machine itself, not the container. If you are using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on the host, it should work because the port is already mapped to the host. So, you can open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

or

```
http://127.0.0.1:8888
```

If you need to use a specific network interface (e.g., `eth0`), you can find its IP address using the `ifconfig` command and use that IP address instead. For example, if the IP address of `eth0` is `192.168.1.100`, you would navigate to:

```
http://192.168.1.100:8888
```

This should allow you to access the Jupyter notebook running in the Docker container from your host machine's web browser.
