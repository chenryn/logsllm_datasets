**ATT&CK ID:** T1136.001  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Local Account

Adversaries may create local accounts to maintain persistent access to victim systems. Local accounts are typically configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administrative purposes on a single system or service. 

On Windows systems, adversaries with sufficient privileges can use the `net user /add` command to create a local account. On macOS, the `dscl -create` command can be used to achieve the same purpose. Additionally, local accounts can be added to network devices, often through common Network Device Command Line Interface (CLI) commands such as `username`.

By creating these local accounts, adversaries can ensure continued access and control over the compromised system, even if other credentials are changed or removed.
