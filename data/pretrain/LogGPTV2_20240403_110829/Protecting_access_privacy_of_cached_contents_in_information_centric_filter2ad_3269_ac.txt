proximation in Eq. 1. To understand the impact of different values
of d we deﬁne the maintained RTT gain metric as the difference be-
tween the gain in RTT due to caching for subsequent interest fulﬁll-
ments (when contents are cached 1-hop away from the requesting
host) and the the incurred delay due to the added noise in our pro-
tocols at a given d. This maintained gain is especially signiﬁcant
to benign users requesting the contents in the future. By observing
that the ﬁrst hop’s RTT is negligible, we consider the maintained
RTT gain (normalized) as 1 − (td(n)/tdx) ≈ 1 − RT T t
d. We
compute this quantity for the min, max, mean, and median RT T t
of the different sites, for different d values.
d
Even when the router has the capability to record a per-hop RTT
and add a given number of hops as noise—not an estimate as de-
scribed in the protocols, the overhead as additional time delay added
to the RTT of fulﬁlling requests to users still maintains the beneﬁts
of ICN as shown in Figure 5. For example, when d = 6 (which
is one-third of the hop count to the origin server thus providing
high anonymity set), a request to an average site would be fulﬁlled
about 40 times faster than retrieving contents from the origin server
(0.975 gain). Even for the site with the longest RTT, it would be
25 times (0.96 gain) faster than getting contents from the origin
server. Even when d increases the results are not affected greatly:
for d = 7, the mean, median, and max gain are 0.965, 0.97, 0.75,

respectively. Similarly, for d = 8, we obtain 0.7, 0.633, and 0.62,
respectively. However, as d reaches a value that makes the path
traverse the core congested network with high TTL, this result de-
grades greatly: the performance worsen to reach an average gain of
0.5 at d = 11. As before, RTT is dominated by network latencies,
whereas CCNx delays are negligible, supporting our claim that our
designs maintain ICN’s gain in RTT, and that the performance is
tunable depending on the desirable privacy to provide to users.
How network conditions affect the performance. Both of the
previous sections make conclusions that are network-dependent.
Accordingly, we perform similar requests from another commercial
campus network that is separated from the Internet backbone by
several hops, where several middle boxes are used for security pur-
pose (the average total RTT has increased in these measurements by
300%). In these measurements we observe that the ﬁrst hop would
at average constitute 1% of the overall RTT, making the attack eas-
ily applicable, and the maintained gain for d = 6 in sites that have
16 returned hops by traceroute is 0.88 at average (8 times faster
than retrieving contents from the origin server). We further make
similar measurements by performing those requests from a residen-
tial network, and ﬁnd a similar RTT for the ﬁrst hop, although the
gain for d = 6 for similar set of sites is 0.92 at average.
Overhead evaluation. The overhead depends greatly on how of-
ten contents are ﬂagged for privacy. Since we assume that a user
who uses the pmode with requests is trusted, the overhead is a
good estimate of real privacy needs. Misuses that try to exploit that
and generate excessive overhead on routers can be penalized by
feedbacks from other users. We notice that the last protocol, which
outperforms all others, have limited overhead on routers. Also, we
emphasize that there is no overhead on the network, since the delay
generated would not affect the location of contents in the cache, but
the time at which an interest is fulﬁlled.
5. DISCUSSION
We assume that the adversary and the benign user are residing
behind the same router, and are 1-hop away from each other. Thus,
if both users are 2-hops away, the adversary will still be able to
infer some information about the co-location of the benign user
who has requested the contents. We address this issue in two ways.
First, given that the ﬁrst few hops (as shown in Figure 4) have small
RTTs, the adversary must have sensitive measurements capability
at the microsecond level to be able to tell if the user is 2, 3, or
4 hops away with conﬁdence. Second, even in current networks
which have many subscribers to the same routing infrastructure, 2-
hop away users could likely be hidden in a large enough anonymity
set. This makes it hard for the adversary to pinpoint a smaller set
of users who could be potentially the requesters of the contents.

We also assume that the adversary cannot collude with routers.
However, two users acting as adversaries may collude with each
other and try to bypass our defenses. For example, each of the col-
luding malicious users could issue an interest for a certain content,
and compare their timings to infer whether the content has been
cached or not. We notice that such collusion is only applicable to
the ﬁrst protocol. In the two latter protocols, requests have to go
through the same face, thus they will be considered as if they are
from the same entity, regardless to the users who issued them.
A ﬁnal attack is what we coin the “intersection attack”, in which
two geographically distributed attackers collude to infer if a piece
of contents is cached or not. For example two nodes that are 3 hops
away on the path of contents receiving the same time measurements
can infer the manipulation by the router by contradicting their mea-
surements . However, in order for this attack to work, the attackers
need to: 1) be geographically distributed, and 2) know in advance
the path benign requests have traversed. While the ﬁrst requirement
would violate one of our attacker model assumptions, we believe
that the second requirement would require collusion of the under-
lying infrastructure (routers) or much larger number of attackers to
make a good estimate of the path. Even though the attack is possi-
ble in theory, our defenses and privacy protection mechanisms raise
the bar greatly for the attack in practice.
6. RELATED WORK
Concurrent to our work, [14] pointed out the attack under dif-
ferent caching policies, but falls short in not providing any work-
able solutions to it. Caching has been widely investigated, although
motivated by the performance rather than privacy. Examples of the
prior literature include the work in [8, 13, 15].
Security and privacy in ICN have been discussed in several re-

cent works.
Named-based trust and security protection mechanisms are intro-
duced in [20]. Different naming conventions in ICN architectures
and their security features are discussed in [9]. A privacy-preserving
contents retrieval in ICN (that assumes the origin server is dishon-
est) is proposed in [6]. A diverse array of security mechanisms
for ICN is introduced in [12]. A closely related architecture that
makes accountability as a ﬁrst-order property, named AIP, is in-
troduced in [4] (which shares similarities with the naming in [7]).
Arguments for ICN and future Internet design in general are in [17].
7. CONCLUSION
We have introduced an attack on content access privacy that is
applicable to several ICN architectures, including the NDN. We
show that an adversary with the capability to perform timing mea-
surements can infer whether contents have been fetched by other
users by exploiting the universal caching mechanism deployed in
such architecture. We verify such attack theoretically and empir-
ically using real-world per-hop time measurements. To withstand
such attack, we introduce three protocols, each of which comes
at varying cost and beneﬁts to the network.
In these protocols,
we make use of carefully chosen time delay to responses given by
routers to fulﬁll requests by users. The delay is chosen to strike a
balance between the amount of privacy provided to users—which is
determined by the delay added to increase a number of virtual hops
away from the user requesting privacy-related contents, the over-
head on routers, and the degradation of service to benign users.
Our future work will include looking into how different caching
polices will affect our attack and countermeasures.
