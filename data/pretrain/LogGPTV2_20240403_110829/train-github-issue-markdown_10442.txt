# Environment
    Windows build number: [run "ver" at a command prompt]
    PowerToys version: v0.19.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): installer
# Steps to reproduce
This has occurred on both v0.18.2 and v0.19.0  
When installing the program, it pauses about 2/3 through the validation phase
near completion, then pops up a request to close one or more applications
before it can complete. On 18.2 it requested closure of Outlook, Teams and
Nitro Pro. On 19.0 it requested closure of Teams. I had to go to Task
Manager/Details and close all Teams processes, because closing the application
in the Taskbar did not suffice to clear the open/running processes in my
runtime environment.
# Expected behavior
Expect program to install without requiring manual closure of other, open
apps.
# Actual behavior
installer pauses and waits on me with a Retry button for requested apps to be
closed.
