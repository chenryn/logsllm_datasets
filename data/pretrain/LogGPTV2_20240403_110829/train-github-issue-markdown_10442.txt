# Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** [Run "ver" at a command prompt]
- **PowerToys Version:** v0.19.0
- **PowerToy Module (if applicable):** Installer

# Steps to Reproduce
This issue has occurred with both versions v0.18.2 and v0.19.0.

1. Start the PowerToys installation process.
2. The installer will pause approximately 2/3 through the validation phase, near completion.
3. A popup will appear requesting the closure of one or more applications before the installation can continue.
   - In version 0.18.2, the installer requested the closure of Outlook, Teams, and Nitro Pro.
   - In version 0.19.0, the installer requested the closure of Teams.
4. To proceed, you must manually close the specified applications. For example, in the case of Teams, closing the application from the Taskbar is not sufficient; you must use Task Manager to terminate all related processes.

# Expected Behavior
The PowerToys installer should complete the installation without requiring the manual closure of other open applications.

# Actual Behavior
The installer pauses and displays a "Retry" button, waiting for the user to close the specified applications.
