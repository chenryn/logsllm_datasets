Abstract—The home computer user is often said to be the
weakest link in computer security. They do not always follow
security advice, and they take actions, as in phishing, that
compromise themselves. In general, we do not understand why
users do not always behave safely, which would seem to be in
their best interest. This paper reviews the literature of surveys
and studies of factors that inﬂuence security decisions for home
computer users. We organize the review in four sections: un-
derstanding of threats, perceptions of risky behavior, efforts to
avoid security breaches and attitudes to security interventions.
We ﬁnd that these studies reveal a lot of reasons why current
security measures may not match the needs or abilities of home
computer users and suggest future work needed to inform how
security is delivered to this user group.

I. WHY STUDY THE HOME COMPUTER USER?
The home computer user is often said to be the weak-
est link in computer security. Security and privacy threats
such as Web cookies and phishing require some form of
user complicity or acquiescence. Adequate security does
not come with the purchase of the computer but requires
additional software, careful settings within applications, ap-
propriate choices of passwords, regular updating of patches,
etc. Moreover, as applications are becoming more inter-
esting/useful and businesses are moving away from paper,
home computer users are performing more sensitive tasks
online and storing more private data on their computers.
Anecdotal evidence, surveys, and studies suggest that home
computer users often do not adequately understand the
threats, or have the time, desire and knowledge to be able to
handle them. As large outbreaks of worms and viruses have
shown, even systems administrators are not diligent enough
in applying patches to improve security [1].
Although home users are frequent targets of attacks1 and
the security software market (primary source of defense
for home users) currently brings in more than $4 billion2,
relatively little is still known about how the home user
1A 2007 Symantec report states that 95% of attacks were directed at
home users [2].
2The exact number is difﬁcult to ﬁnd. This ﬁgure probably is for anti-
virus software sales overall [3]. The total for security software may be
as high at $14 billion this year [4], but because of business sales, it is
impossible to tease apart impact of the home user.
views security threats, privacy threats, and defenses. Various
surveys (e.g., [5], [6], [7]) show that many home computer
users do not adequately maintain their home systems to
support security and often ignore or simply do not act in
ways that would keep them secure. Thus, security should
be improved overall if developers better understand what
inﬂuences decisions about security for the home computer
user. In this paper, we review studies about the attitudes,
perceptions and actions of home computer users. Current
defense measures (e.g., patches, anti-virus software, pop-
up security warnings) are clearly not working as well as
we need; therefore, better knowledge of how users perceive
security threats and what the users appreciate about the
consequences of their actions can be leveraged to develop
more effective interventions and countermeasures.
Whether and how to keep one’s computer secure are
decisions made by each and every computer user. A survey
of 415 home computer users in the U.K. recruited through
email and different Web forums [8], [5] showed that 90% of
respondents agreed that home users were responsible for the
security of their computers. In a followup interview study
of 23 participants, Australian users also stated they believed
the end-user was responsible for security [9].
Aytes and Connolly [1], [6] identify ﬁve factors that inﬂu-
ence users’ decisions of how to keep their computer’s secure:
1) awareness of what constitutes safe practices, 2) awareness
of possible negative consequences of not following safe
practices, 3) awareness of availability of resources to support
safe practices, 4) probability of negative consequences and
5) cost of the consequences. This review divides these
factors into two general categories: knowledge of security
risks and consequences, and knowledge of defensive security
actions (i.e., safe practices). We ﬁrst discuss some demo-
graphics of the home computer user as found in the studies,
and follow with what is known about these two categories
of factors inﬂuencing user behavior. Presenting a cohesive,
comprehensive view is impossible as the studies asked
different questions, had different goals, solicited participants
in different ways and sometimes are temporally disconnected
(the oldest study is from 1999, most recent from 2011).
Longitudinal studies are lacking. However, we point out
commonalities and differences in results and where possible

in our knowledge of behavior and needed future work. In
each case, when a study is introduced, a short description is
provided about the number and type of participants and the
methodology used (e.g., survey, interview, automated data
collection via their computers).
II. THE HOME COMPUTER USER
One of the more difﬁcult aspects of the studies conducted
on this topic is that there is no canonical home computer
user. Users may be adults performing normal household
tasks such as shopping and banking, parents helping their
children use educational software, retirees who primarily
email their grandchildren, or college undergraduates who
have been using computers since pre-school. The population
of home users is diverse and huge. Exactly how large
worldwide is difﬁcult to know; as an upper bound, Gartner
estimates that 2 billion personal computers will be in use by
2014 [10]. For the purposes of this paper, the distinguishing
characteristic is that
the users are not professionals in
computing: they use the computer for all kinds of tasks to
support their lives, but they do not develop for it and tend to
have little to no formal training in the use of their computer.
We also generally limit the discussion to users of computers
in the home environment; computers and users in the work
environment often have access to IT professionals via their
employer and are required to follow employer’s rules for the
workplace equipment.
A. Demographics/Characteristics from Studies
Studies often focus on a particular user community. For
example, Solic and Ilakovac surveyed 39 university faculty
from electrical engineering and medical schools who were
given laptops by their schools, to assess their attitudes to-
ward security and identify potential differences in these two
groups [11]. Friedman et al. [12] conducted semi-structured
two hour interviews of 72 adults (ages 19-75) from three
different communities (rural in Maine, suburban professional
in New Jersey and high-technology in California) to identify
what risks concerned them most about Web security and
determine whether there were differences between these
communities. Diesner et al. [13] surveyed educated users in
India because many international corporations are locating
their global data centers in India, suggesting that as a
country, India may have more access to personal data.
Undergraduates are the focus of multiple studies because
they tend to have a high level of computer usage/familiarity
and are a readily available sample. Aytes and Connolly [6]
conducted a wide ranging survey of undergraduates at two
different U.S.A. universities to assess their knowledge of
risks and the actions they take to address the risks. One
purpose of studies comparing two different groups (e.g., the
different universities) is to assess generality of conclusions:
can the results of one study transfer to larger or different
groups of user?
In most cases, basic demographic information was ob-
tained (e.g., age, gender, education), but the reports did not
often describe signiﬁcant effects due to the demographic
information. As counter examples, one survey [8] found
that women were less likely to rate themselves as advanced
users. A survey of 493 users of online shopping services [14]
resulted in a model in which “male” and “college graduate”
exerted a positive inﬂuence on tendency to engage in risky
behaviors online. Socioeconomic demographics may also be
germane; participants in [9] made comments such as “I don’t
earn over $40,000 a year so there is no reason for someone
to attack my computer . . .” and “I don’t think anyone would
attack my home computer, there is nothing important on it,”
suggesting that they believed that only wealthy people are
targeted by security threats. Age may also play a signiﬁcant
role. In a study that included both college aged and older
adults, the researchers found that older adults tended to
perceive a lower risk from a threat involving loss of data
conﬁdentiality than college aged adults [15].
Often general information related to their computer use
(e.g., how much formal training they had, how much experi-
ence they had with the Internet, what operating system/kind
of computer they used) was important, but needed to be
carefully examined as self-reports were sometimes at odds
with other evidence. For example, some respondents with
as little as two years of using the Internet claimed to be
advanced users [8]. The type of computer/operating system
was part of a general trend in usage. Users of Macs [16]
and PCs with LINUX [11] tended to use security software
at a lower rate, often not at all, because they felt that their
operating system choice made them invulnerable.
Home computers are often shared among multiple users,
which can make it difﬁcult to tease apart the activities and
motivations of the users. One survey found that 30% of
respondents had computers used by children up to age 18 [8].
Children may heighten the awareness of privacy issues and
cause security issues of their own because they are less likely
to be aware of the security consequences of their actions.
In the 2007 U.K. survey, the most common activities for
home computers were Web browsing and e-mail (97% and
99% surveyed, respectively), but more than 50% also used
their computers for shopping, auctions, instant messaging,
education, banking, and work [8]. Similarly, in a 2011 Pew
study of computer usage in the U.S.A., the most common
activities for adults were e-mail (92% of users), searching
for information (92%) and looking for health or hobby in-
formation (83%), but more than 50% of the users engaged in
other activities such as shopping, watching videos, banking,
social networking, etc. [17].
The percentage of people affected by security and privacy
problems is signiﬁcant. In a survey of 1000 people selected
through randomized telephone calling in Michigan in 2007,

the respondents experienced most on
the problems that
their computers were: spam (67%), computer running slower
(57%), spyware (42%), computer virus (35%), phishing
scams (34%), and new icons or programs appearing on the
desktop out of nowhere (25%) [18].
Generally, the studies encompass between 20-500 par-
ticipants. A few notable exceptions were the Pew In-
ternet studies such as [17]
included 1522 adults,
the NCSA/Symantec survey of 3,500 adults [7] and the
Florˆencio and Herley study of Web password use where
the authors obtained data from half a million users over a
period of three months by adding an optional module to the
Windows Live Toolbar in Summer/Fall 2006 [19].

B. Sources of Information
Various studies report signiﬁcant gaps in education and
knowledge of home users. A signiﬁcant
issue therefore
is the user’s sources of information: from whom or from
where are they learning about computer security and privacy
issues and actions? The most common sources of security
information in the 2007 U.K. study were found to be public
information websites (43% of respondents), IT professionals
(43%) and friend or relative (41%) [8]. In the followup in
Australia [9], the most common source of advice was the
local computer store. An interview-based study of how home
users might work with others in setting up and maintaining
home computer networks found that because maintaining a
home network was so much work and required so much
knowledge to do so, users often rely on outsiders (e.g.,
friends, technicians) to help them troubleshoot problems
[20].
In a study from 2004 [6], undergraduates self-reported
a high level of knowledge about using email (93% report
knowledgeable or expert) and protecting their computers
from viruses and crashes (69% are knowledgeable or ex-
pert). However, their most common sources of information
were friends and co-workers (52%) and personal expe-
rience (42%). Only 19% received formal security train-
ing/education. In contrast, the NCSA/Symantec survey of
3,500 adults [7] noted that 43% had security training of
some type. These differences probably arose from how the
users were asked about their sources of information and
prior training as well as the demographics of the surveys
(undergraduates versus adults) and the time that had elapsed
(2004 to 2010).

and commercial entities to produce websites to educate

III. PREDICTIVE MODELS
Several studies were designed to assess the accuracy of
predictive models of speciﬁc security and privacy behaviors.
Often the models are extensions of existing social cognitive
theories of factors that produce risky behavior in other de-
cision situations, e.g., preventive health [21], crime control,
environmental protection. Two types of models are promi-
nent: Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Protection
Motivation Theory (PMT).
