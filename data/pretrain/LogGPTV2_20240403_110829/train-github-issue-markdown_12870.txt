  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10.5)
  * Default syntax highlighting
  * Issue persists when running VSCode with `--disable-extensions`
Syntax highlighting gets confused within for loop. Strings don't get
recognized. Elements that follow a string are considered to be strings instead
(as it seems to me).  
After the for-loop there are still syntax highlighting errors but line 74 in
screenshot looks fine again.
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Open new TypeScript file within Angular 2 project (aka create new component)
  2. Create for loop (see Screenshot)
