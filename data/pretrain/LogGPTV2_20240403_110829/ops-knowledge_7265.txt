User: I have installed both libxml2 and libxslt with homebrew, but it doesn't want to install libxml2-dev or libxslt-dev:
Error: No available formula for libxml2-dev
I have pip, port, and all I could found. I even installed the Xcode command line tools, 
but with no luck. What is the way to install libxml2-dev & libxslt-dev on Mac 10.10?
Assistant: Try adding STATIC_DEPS, like this
STATIC_DEPS=true sudo pip install lxml
