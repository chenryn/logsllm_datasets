I understand that you have installed `libxml2` and `libxslt` using Homebrew, but you are encountering issues when trying to install the development versions (`libxml2-dev` and `libxslt-dev`). The error message indicates that there is no available formula for `libxml2-dev`. Additionally, you have already tried using `pip`, MacPorts, and even installing Xcode command line tools, but without success.

For macOS 10.10, you can try the following approach to resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure Homebrew is Up-to-Date:**
   First, make sure your Homebrew installation is up-to-date by running:
   ```sh
   brew update
   ```

2. **Install Development Headers:**
   Since Homebrew does not provide separate development packages, the headers and libraries are typically included in the main package. You can reinstall `libxml2` and `libxslt` to ensure they include the necessary development files:
   ```sh
   brew reinstall libxml2
   brew reinstall libxslt
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   To help `pip` find the correct libraries and headers, you can set the `LDFLAGS` and `CPPFLAGS` environment variables. Add the following lines to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`):
   ```sh
   export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib -L/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include -I/usr/local/opt/libxslt/include"
   ```

4. **Install `lxml` with `pip`:**
   Now, you can install `lxml` using `pip`:
   ```sh
   pip install lxml
   ```

If you still encounter issues, you can try a static build of `lxml` by setting the `STATIC_DEPS` environment variable:
```sh
STATIC_DEPS=true pip install lxml
```

This should help you install the required packages and their development files on macOS 10.10.
