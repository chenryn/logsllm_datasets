### The Tor Project

**Mission:**
Our mission is to serve as the global resource for technology, advocacy, research, and education in the ongoing pursuit of freedom of speech, privacy rights online, and censorship circumvention.

### Key Features

- **Online Anonymity:**
  - Open Source
  - Open Network
- **Community:**
  - Researchers, developers, users, and relay operators
- **Organization:**
  - U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
- **User Base:**
  - Estimated 2,000,000+ daily Tor users

### Threat Model

- **Attacker Capabilities:**
  - Watch Alice or Bob
  - Control part of the network

### Understanding Anonymity

- **Anonymity vs. Encryption:**
  - Encryption protects the content of communications.
  - Anonymity conceals the identities of the communicating parties.

  **Example:**
  - Alice sends "Hi, Bob!" to Bob.
  - The attacker can see "Hi, Bob!" but cannot determine that Alice sent it.

### Different User Interests

- **Private Citizens:**
  - Anonymity means privacy.
- **Businesses:**
  - Anonymity means network security.
- **Governments:**
  - Anonymity means traffic-analysis resistance.
- **Human Rights Activists:**
  - Anonymity means reachability.

### Simple Designs and Their Limitations

- **Single Relay:**
  - A single relay can hide connections.
  - Example: Some commercial proxy providers.
  
  **Diagram:**
  ```
  Alice1 -> Alice2 -> Alice3
  Bob1   -> Bob2   -> Bob3
  Relay  -> E(Bob3,“X”) -> E(Bob1, “Y”) -> E(Bob2, “Z”)
  ```

- **Central Relay Risks:**
  - Single point of failure or bypass.
  - Timing analysis can bridge all connections through the relay, making it a target.

  **Diagram:**
  ```
  Alice1 -> Alice2 -> Alice3
  Bob1   -> Bob2   -> Bob3
  Evil/Irrelevant Relay  -> E(Bob3,“X”) -> E(Bob1, “Y”) -> E(Bob2, “Z”)
  ```

### Tor's Safety from Diversity

- **Diversity of Relays:**
  - More relays and greater diversity reduce the risk of traffic confirmation.
  - Research problem: measuring diversity over time.

- **Diversity of Users:**
  - A large and diverse user base (e.g., 50,000 users in Iran) makes it difficult to identify specific individuals.

### Transparency in Tor

- **Open Source/Free Software:**
- **Public Design Documents and Specifications:**
- **Publicly Identified Developers:**
- **Privacy is About Choice:**

### Addressing Concerns

- **Bad Actors:**
  - Remember the millions of daily users.
  - Good people need Tor more than bad actors.

### Myths Debunked

- **Myth #1:**
  - "The Navy wrote Tor originally, so how can I trust it?"
- **Myth #2:**
  - "The NSA runs half the relays."
- **Myth #3:**
  - "Tor is slow."
- **Myth #4:**
  - "Tor gets most of its money from the US government."
- **Myth #5:**
  - "80% of Tor users are bad people."
- **Myth #6:**
  - "I shouldn't use Tor because the NSA will watch me."
- **Myth #7:**
  - "Tor is broken."

### Onion Services

- **Properties:**
  - Self-authenticated
  - End-to-end encrypted
  - Built-in NAT punching
  - Limited surface area
  - No need to exit from Tor

### Tools and Services

- **SecureDrop:**
  - Used by 30+ organizations.
  - [SecureDrop Directory](https://securedrop.org/directory)

- **Ricochet:**
  - [Ricochet Website](https://ricochet.im/)

- **OnionShare:**
  - [OnionShare Website](https://onionshare.org/)

- **Riseup.net:**
  - All services available using hidden services.
  - [Riseup Tor Hidden Services](https://help.riseup.net/en/tor#riseups-tor-hidden-services)

- **Package Repository:**
  - `apt-get install apt-tor-transport`
  - [Tor Package Repository](http://vwakviie2ienjx6t.onion/)

### Benefits of Anonymous Updates

- **Evil Package Repositories:**
  - Cannot target you with a bad update because they don't know it's you.
- **Local Observers:**
  - Cannot learn what you're updating, so they can't target you for being out of date.

### HS Directory and Hashring

- **Hashring:**
  - Predictable HSDir relays can be targeted for censorship or popularity measurement.
  - Solution: Use a communal random value for HSDir mapping, picked by directory authorities.

### New Cryptographic Features

- **New Keys:**
  - Stronger ECC keys (ED25519) replace weak SHA-1 keys.
  - Longer onion addresses: from 16 characters to 52 characters.

- **Hiding Onion Addresses:**
  - New cryptosystem allows signing with a subkey, preventing the main key from being discovered.

### Rendezvous Single Onion Services

- **Proposal 260:**
  - [Rendezvous Point Proposal](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/plain/proposals/260-rendezvous-single-onion.txt)

### Guard Discovery

- **Guard Relays:**
  - Single guard for the first hop in all paths to limit exposed surface area.
  - Vulnerable to attacks that can discover a user's guard.

### Vanguards

- **Multiple Layers of Guards:**
  - Better protection against Sybil and compromise attacks.
  - Path selection is an open research area.

### Deployment Timeline

- **HSDir Side:**
  - Deployed in Tor 0.3.0
- **Relay Side:**
  - Deployed in Tor 0.3.0
- **Client Side:**
