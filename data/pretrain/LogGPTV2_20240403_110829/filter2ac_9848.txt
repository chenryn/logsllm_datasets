## Abstract
ProjecToR is an innovative, agile, and reconfigurable data center interconnect designed to dynamically adjust capacity between top-of-rack (ToR) pairs based on traffic demands. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of ProjecToR, highlighting its key features and advantages over traditional static interconnects.

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Today's Data Center Interconnects
Current data center interconnects typically operate at 10Gbps and have a static capacity between ToR pairs. For example, in a 4-ToR setup, the static capacity matrix might look like this:

|   | A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 0 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| B | 3 | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| C | 3 | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| D | 3 | 3 | 3 | 0 |

However, the ideal demand matrix is often uniform and static, while the actual demand matrix can be skewed and dynamic:

|   | A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| B | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7 |
| C | 0 | 0 | 8 | 0 |
| D | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### 1.2 Need for a Reconfigurable Interconnect
#### Data and Observations
- **Data:** 
  - 200K servers across 4 production clusters.
  - Cluster sizes range from 100 to 2500 racks.
- **Observations:**
  - Many rack pairs exchange little traffic.
  - Only some "hot" rack pairs are active.
- **Implications:**
  - Static topology with uniform capacity:
    - Over-provisioned for most rack pairs.
    - Under-provisioned for a few others.

#### Solution
A reconfigurable interconnect can dynamically provide additional capacity between hot rack pairs, addressing these issues.

## 2. Desirable Properties of a Reconfigurable Interconnect
### 2.1 Seamless Integration
- **Observation:** Traffic matrices differ widely.
- **Implication:** It is difficult to determine the optimal divide between static and reconfigurable links. A seamless interconnect is necessary.

### 2.2 High Fan-out and Low Switching Time
- **Observation:**
  - Source racks send large amounts of traffic to many other racks.
- **Implications:**
  - Should create direct links to many other racks (high fan-out).
  - Should switch quickly among destinations (low switching time).

### 2.3 Comparison with Existing Technologies
- **Seamless, High Fan-out, Low Switching Time:**
  - **Helios, Mordia** [SIGCOMM'10, SIGCOMM'13]
  - **3D Beam Forming, Flyways** [SIGCOMM'12, HotNets'09, SIGCOMM'11, SIGCOMM'12]
  - **FireFly** [SIGCOMM'14]

- **Enabler Technology:**
  - **Optical Circuit Switch**
  - **60GHz Wireless**
  - **Free-Space Optics**

## 3. ProjecToR Interconnect
### 3.1 Key Features
- **Free-space topology** (seamless)
- **High fan-out** (up to 18,000, 60 times more than optical circuit switches)
- **Low switching time** (12 μs, 2500 times faster than optical circuit switches)

### 3.2 Components
- **Laser and Photodetector**
- **Digital Micromirror Device (DMD)**
- **Mirror Assembly**

## 4. Reconfiguration in ProjecToR
### 4.1 Digital Micromirror Device (DMD)
- **Array of micromirrors (10 μm)**
- **Memory cell**
- **Theoretical accessible locations:** 768x768 = 589,824
- **Achievable accessible locations:** 768x768 / 32 = 18,432
- **Cross-talk between adjacent locations**

### 4.2 Mirror Assemblies
- **Challenge:** DMDs have a narrow angular reach.
- **Solution:** Coupling DMDs with angled mirrors to magnify reach.

## 5. Prototype and Evaluation
### 5.1 Feasibility
- **Prototype:** Built and micro-benchmarked a small 3-ToR ProjecToR prototype.
- **Robustness:** Tested under various environmental conditions.

### 5.2 Routing and Scheduling
- **Routing Algorithm:** Devised a scheduling algorithm and simulated its performance.
- **Cost Estimation:** Estimated cost based on the breakdown of each component.

### 5.3 Throughput and Switching Time
- **Throughput:** Compared ProjecToR link with wired link, achieving similar throughput.
- **Switching Time:** Demonstrated fast switching time (12 μs).

## 6. Simulations
### 6.1 Simulation Setup
- **Topology:** 128-ToR (1024 servers) with 16 lasers and photodetectors.
- **Traffic Matrix:** Day-long traffic matrix to build the dedicated topology, 5-min traffic matrix to generate communication probabilities.
- **TCP Flows:** Arrival with Poisson rate and realistic flow sizes.

### 6.2 Results
- **Comparison with Fat Tree and FireFly:**
  - **Tail Flow Completion Time:** Different traffic matrices.
  - **Impact of Fan-out and Switching Time:**
    - **Fat Tree:** No reconfigurability, slow switching time, low fan-out.
    - **FireFly:** No reconfigurability.
    - **ProjecToR:** Reconfigurable, fast switching time (12 μs), high fan-out.

## 7. Conclusion
ProjecToR offers a seamless, high fan-out, and low switching time interconnect solution for data centers. The small prototype demonstrates feasibility, and the decentralized flow scheduling algorithm ensures efficient operation. ProjecToR is a promising approach to address the dynamic nature of data center traffic.
