### Key Issuance and Verification in TRAKS

The key issuance process in TRAKS includes a hash of the database of keys installed on the entity. The response is then encrypted and MACed using transport keys shared between the train/RBC (Radio Block Center) and KMC (Key Management Centre).

#### Vendor Commissioning Confirmation
The vendor or operator provides the response to the KMC, which verifies it using the transport keys. The KMC also compares its local key database hash (corresponding to the train/RBC) to ensure that it matches the one in the response. If there is a mismatch, the protocol requires the re-issuance of keys.

An example of the key issuance protocol for a new train under the TRAKS scheme is provided in Figure 5.

### Considerations in TRAKS

In TRAKS, key revocation is considered an exceptionally rare event compared to the regular revocation processes seen in public-key systems with certificates. If a key becomes compromised on a train, the infrastructure manager must allocate a new ETCS ID to the train and provide new keys. A similar process is followed for RBCs, where an engineer interacting with the affected unit is an acceptable overhead.

The current ERTMS (European Rail Traffic Management System) specification and guidance from National Standards Bodies, such as RSSB [14], do not specify a quantitative duration for key validity beyond "the most time the key is required." As part of TRAKS, we recommend a regular rekeying interval to prevent attacks, such as those presented in [4]. Rekeying can be performed during maintenance intervals when trains are at depots to ensure safe installation of keying material. We do not see the blacklist, maintained and distributed by the KMC, imposing considerable burdens on infrastructure managers and train owners.

For RBCs, which are already networked to allow intercommunication with other RBCs, it may be possible to move the RBCs to communicate with the KMC online and at regular intervals. For trains, maintenance would occur offline at the depot.

### Applications of TRAKS in a Secure Architecture

#### EuroRadio MAC Keying
TRAKS can be used in the EuroRadio handshake protocol. A pseudo-random function (PRF), such as HMAC-SHA-256, should be used for key management operations. This ensures the security of keying material in transit between the KMC and approved organizations, such as vendors and train operators. Given the current scheme relies on 3DES keys, a subset of the 256-bit output can be used as the 3DES key until support for 256-bit keys is implemented.

We also recommend the use of a signed or MAC-protected blacklist, which can be retrieved regularly to ensure that, in the event of revocation, RBCs and trains do not interact with possibly compromised infrastructure.

#### EuroBalise Payload Security
Currently, the data held on EuroBalises is protected with a CRC [21], which allows an attacker to define their own balise payload, increasing line speeds or creating a 'virtual' block. This data is trusted by the train for position reports to the RBC, which is used for the safe supervision of the network.

To enhance security, the payloads on the balises should be authenticated. Balise payloads, except for ETCS Level 1 deployments, are static and can be signed or accompanied by a MAC. TRAKS defines a Key Management Scheme that provides a 'per-balise' MAC key, ensuring that the compromise of one balise-specific key does not enable the attacker to impersonate other balises in the network.

At the root of TRAKS, the KMC generates a national balise secret, such as kmGB for Great Britain, which is used to generate all subkeys linked to the NID C of the line. This produces kmNID C,bid, which is installed on all OBUs (On-Board Units) allowed to operate within a given NID C. When the train passes over the balise and reads the telegrams, it can derive the MAC key using the Balise Group ID and verify the MAC. If the MAC fails verification, a 'violation' is recorded, allowing the infrastructure manager to attend to the faulty balise. If the train records erroneous 'violations,' the issue is referred to the vendor for reactive maintenance.

Under this scheme, all OBU units must have a trusted execution environment, such as Intel SGX or ARM TrustZone, to prevent the extraction of kmNID C,bid keys and to ensure only authorized cryptographic operations are performed using the keys. Balises do not store the kmNID C,bid key; instead, the key is made available to the encoding units during maintenance periods, with the balise containing only the (plaintext, MAC) payload.

While balise keys are always derived and never stored, balise-specific keys provide defense in depth, ensuring that the compromise of one balise MAC does not compromise others. However, EuroBalises can still be moved.

An alternative solution would be to implement a protocol where the train and balises compute MACs in real-time. However, considering the speed at which balises are read (in excess of 300km/h), implementing such a protocol would be difficult. Therefore, providing a static payload with a MAC is more efficient and less prone to transmission errors.

#### ICS PLC Environments
TRAKS can also be applied to other ICS (Industrial Control System) environments, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in ICS/SCADA systems. These devices often communicate without protection, allowing attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks and potentially put the system into an unsafe state.

A simple solution is to apply MACs to each message sent by a PLC. However, using a single key across the network offers little security. Instead, partitioning the system into specific 'zones' of control, analogous to the NID C variable in ERTMS, allows a centralized key to be defined per zone and installed on the appropriate hardware. A derivation step on the controllers enables the use of per-device keys in actual communications.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we present a new key management solution that can be applied to various industrial control system environments. Using proven cryptographic techniques, TRAKS achieves an interoperable, backward-compatible solution for ERTMS, reducing management overheads for National Infrastructure Managers and delivering post-quantum security. This scheme has further applications beyond EuroRadio, including EuroBalises, to ensure safety through security. By applying a partitioned system principle to ERTMS, we have developed a key distribution scheme that maintains the same level of security while delivering significant benefits to ICS owners and operators.
