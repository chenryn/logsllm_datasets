User:  company uses MongoDB as the back-end database of key applications, and needs to ensure data backup and recovery. Please provide a MongoDB backup and restore solution.

It will export the data as a BSON file which can be used by the mongorestore command to restore the data. You can periodically use the mongodump command to back up data. 2. Backup to a remote server: In order to avoid irreversible restoration when the local backup data is lost, it is recommended to store the backup data in a remote server or cloud storage service. Backup data can be transferred to a remote server using tools such as rsync or scp. 3. Automated backup: use scheduled tasks or other automated tools to automatically back up MongoDB data. You can use crontab for Linux or task scheduler for Windows to execute the mongodump command periodically. MongoDB recovery scheme: 1. Use the mongorestore command: MongoDB provides a mongorestore command to restore the data backed up by mongodump. You can use the mongorestore command to import backup data to MongoDB. 2.
