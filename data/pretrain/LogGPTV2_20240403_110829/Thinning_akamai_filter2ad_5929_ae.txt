### Protecting Against Migration Attacks

Despite the fact that admitted flows might be protected during an attack, newly arriving clients could be redirected to distant edge servers, thereby increasing the likelihood of experiencing lower streaming quality. Additionally, resource-based admission control at edge servers does not address potential resource bottlenecks at reflectors, as demonstrated in Section 4.3.

### Solving Puzzles

One approach, which has been successful in web server scenarios, involves using admission control mechanisms capable of accurately distinguishing between DDoS attacks and flash crowds (e.g., [21]). During periods of increased load, the server presents a graphical puzzle that only humans can solve, thus preventing large-scale, automatically orchestrated DDoS attacks.

However, this approach may not be suitable for DNS-driven streaming services for several reasons:
1. **Transparency**: Such systems aim to provide a transparent service to customers (e.g., CNN). The middle provider (Akamai) remains invisible to end users. Introducing graphical puzzles from the middle servers could be annoying for clients.
2. **Targeted Attacks**: If an attack is directed at a reflector, and edge servers are only used as proxies, the edge servers, not being under attack, will experience only moderate load and will not enforce graphical puzzles.
3. **Inappropriateness at Reflectors**: Imposing graphical puzzles at reflectors is even more inappropriate than at edge servers.

### Raising the Bar for Attackers

#### Location-aware Admission Control

To improve client experiences, Akamai's measurement infrastructure uses DNS to redirect clients to the nearest edge server. However, it is possible to override these DNS recommendations and connect to any Akamai streaming edge server from anywhere on the Internet. This poses a serious security risk, as attackers can use machines from around the world to target specific points in the Akamai network.

A countermeasure is to have edge servers reject access to clients that override DNS recommendations. Enforcing such location-aware admission control, even at a coarse-grained scale, would significantly increase the difficulty for potential attackers, though it would not fully solve the problem (as botnets can still exploit a sufficient number of machines in a given network area).

#### Reducing System Transparency

Reducing system transparency is crucial for enhancing security. Here are two proposed measures:

1. **Shielding Vincible IP Addresses**:
   - Exposing edge servers' real IP addresses makes the system vulnerable to misbehaviors. This issue can be mitigated by installing load balancers at edge clusters. Real servers are associated with a load balancer that has a virtual IP address, which is the only publicly available information to clients. This setup makes it n times harder to degrade the system compared to targeting a single server.
   - The disadvantage of hardware-level load balancers is the lack of application-level load balancing capabilities. This can be addressed by assigning multiple virtual IP addresses to the load balancer and configuring server assignments internally.

2. **Shielding Administrative Information**:
   - The transparency of Akamai's streaming infrastructure, where portset names and origin server names are embedded in ARLs, allows third parties to target specific servers. To address this, one approach is to keep channel and customer state at edge servers, although this requires disseminating new stream information to all edge servers. Another approach is to preserve the integrity of ARLs by using credible hash functions or encoding algorithms to shield sensitive information.

### Broader Context

#### Bandwidth-targeted DoS Attacks

While DoS attacks are becoming more sophisticated, bandwidth-targeted attacks against streaming services remain highly feasible and easy to conduct. The increased level of streaming in the Internet has the potential to reverse this trend, as streaming flows consume significant bandwidth, and poor performance easily discourages clients.

#### Tensions Between Transparency and Security

Reducing system transparency can enhance resiliency against DoS attacks, but this approach may not be suitable for the broader Internet. Many ISPs already reduce their transparency for security reasons, which can conflict with the need for transparency in large-scale distributed systems. Balancing these two approaches is challenging.

### Conclusions

This paper explored the resilience of Akamai's streaming architecture to intentional service degradation attempts. We found that the current design is inadequate for preserving high-quality experiences during such attacks. Specifically, the DNS-based redirection subsystem, lack of isolation, strong bias in stream popularity, and highly transparent system design make the network extremely vulnerable. We provided countermeasures, including reducing system transparency and implementing location-aware admission control, to mitigate these vulnerabilities. However, minimal user tolerance for low-quality experiences, combined with the lack of isolation and QoS mechanisms, makes high-quality streaming inherently vulnerable to jamming misbehaviors.
