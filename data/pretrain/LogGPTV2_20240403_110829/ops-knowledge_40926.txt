User: I am a python newbie - I want to use the pymongo library to access mongoDb using some convenient IDE, and after looking through the web i decided to use WING. 
Can some one point how to add the pymongo library to the WING ide (or to any other IDE for that matter)? i want to get the auto-completion for commands.
Thanks
Assistant: If you are in windows platform just install the pymongo.exe file and it will install in python directory. Then you will be able to access it in any IDE such PyCharm by typing:  
import pymongo
