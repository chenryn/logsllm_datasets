**User:**
I am new to Python and I would like to use the `pymongo` library to interact with MongoDB. After some research, I decided to use Wing IDE for my development. Could someone please guide me on how to add the `pymongo` library to Wing IDE (or any other IDE, for that matter)? I would also like to have auto-completion for the `pymongo` commands.

Thanks in advance.

**Assistant:**
Certainly! To use the `pymongo` library in Wing IDE or any other Python IDE, you need to first install the `pymongo` package. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install `pymongo` using pip:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to install `pymongo`:
     ```sh
     pip install pymongo
     ```

2. **Verify the Installation:**
   - You can verify that `pymongo` is installed by running the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     pip show pymongo
     ```
   - This will display information about the `pymongo` package, confirming it is installed correctly.

3. **Configure Your IDE (Wing IDE Example):**
   - **Wing IDE:**
     - Open Wing IDE.
     - Go to `Project > Properties`.
     - In the `Python Path` section, ensure that the path to your Python installation (where `pymongo` was installed) is included.
     - Save the changes and restart Wing IDE if necessary.
   - **Other IDEs (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode):**
     - Most modern IDEs automatically detect installed packages. If not, you may need to configure the Python interpreter to include the directory where `pymongo` is installed.
     - For example, in PyCharm, go to `File > Settings > Project: <your_project> > Python Interpreter`, and ensure the correct interpreter is selected. You can install `pymongo` directly from the IDE if it is not already installed.

4. **Enable Auto-Completion:**
   - Once `pymongo` is installed and your IDE is configured, you should be able to import `pymongo` and get auto-completion for its commands.
   - In your Python script, simply type:
     ```python
     import pymongo
     ```
   - The IDE should provide auto-completion suggestions as you start typing `pymongo` methods and attributes.

If you follow these steps, you should be able to use `pymongo` in Wing IDE or any other Python IDE with full support for auto-completion.
