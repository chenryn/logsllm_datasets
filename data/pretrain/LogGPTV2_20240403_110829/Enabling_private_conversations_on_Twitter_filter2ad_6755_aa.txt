## Abstract
User privacy is a growing concern in online social networks (OSNs). While most OSNs provide some form of privacy controls, these are often insufficient and lack fine-grained protection. This paper introduces a new privacy control for Twitter: group messaging with fine-grained control over who can see the messages. We demonstrate that this privacy control can be implemented without requiring changes to Twitter's system. We designed and implemented Twitsper, a wrapper around Twitter that enables private group communication among existing users while preserving Twitter’s commercial interests. Our design ensures the privacy of group information from both the Twitsper server and other undesired users. Evaluation shows that Twitsper imposes minimal server-side bandwidth requirements and low client-side energy consumption. The Twitsper client for Android devices has been downloaded by over 1,000 users and its utility has been noted in several media articles.

## 1. Introduction
Online social networks (OSNs) have gained immense popularity due to their ability to facilitate information sharing and connections based on shared interests. However, not all shared content is intended for public consumption; users often need to ensure that their information is accessible only to a select group. Although legal frameworks can limit how OSN providers share user data, users rely on the privacy controls provided by the OSN to protect their content from other users. In the absence of effective controls, users concerned about privacy may limit their connections, share less information, or avoid joining OSNs altogether.

Previous proposals to address privacy concerns on existing OSNs either jeopardize the commercial interests of OSN providers or require users to pay for improved privacy. New OSNs developed with privacy in mind have seen limited adoption because users are "locked in" to established platforms where they have invested significant time and effort. Consequently, users have raised privacy concerns in the media, leading organizations like the EFF and FTC to pressure OSNs to make changes. While OSNs have introduced new privacy controls (e.g., Facebook friend lists, Google+ circles), these do not provide sufficiently fine-grained protection.

In this paper, we address the privacy shortcomings on Twitter, one of the most popular OSNs. Twitter currently offers two types of privacy controls: users can share messages with all followers or with a single follower, but there is no way to post a tweet visible to only a subset of followers. We fill this gap by providing fine-grained controls for private group communication. Importantly, we achieve this by implementing a wrapper that builds on Twitter’s existing API, allowing users to benefit from these controls without waiting for Twitter to make changes.

Our main contribution is the design and implementation of Twitsper, a wrapper around Twitter that provides the option of private group communication. Unlike other solutions, Twitsper preserves Twitter’s commercial interests and does not require users to trust it with any private information. Additionally, Twitsper enforces privacy requirements strictly, ensuring that messages posted by a user are visible only to the user’s followers.

### Characterizing Privacy Leakage in OSNs
Krishnamurthy and Willis have characterized the information users reveal on OSNs and how this information leaks to other entities [34, 35]. Legal measures are necessary to prevent OSN providers from leaking user information to third parties. However, it is not in the commercial interests of OSN providers to support systems that hide information from them. Therefore, our focus is on enabling users to protect their information from other undesired users rather than from the OSN provider.

### Privacy Controls Offered by OSNs
Google+ and Facebook allow users to share content with a subset of their friends, but comments on shared content are visible to all recipients. On Facebook, if Alice comments on Bob’s post, Bob’s post becomes visible to Alice’s friend Charlie, even if Bob did not originally share the post with Charlie. Facebook also enables users to form groups, but members must share content with all other group members. Twitter allows users to restrict message sharing to all followers or a single follower, but not to a subset. We extend Twitter’s privacy model to permit private group communication, ensuring that replies to group messages respect the user’s social connections.

### Distributed Social Networks
Several proposals aim to improve user privacy by decentralizing OSNs (e.g., Visa-Vis [42], Conﬁdant [37], DECENT [33], Polaris [45], and PeerSoN [26]). These systems require users to store their data in the cloud or on personal devices, removing the need to trust a central OSN provider. However, rebuilding social connections on a new OSN is challenging. Unlike these efforts, we build a backward-compatible privacy wrapper on Twitter.

### Improving Privacy in Existing OSNs
Lockr [44] manages content sharing without the OSN being aware of the recipients. Other systems allow users to share encrypted content, either directly on OSNs [31, 23, 24] or via out-of-band servers [13]. Hummingbird [28] is a variant of Twitter that supports posting encrypted content to preserve user privacy. Narayanan et al. [39] ensure that location information remains private through private proximity testing. These techniques either prevent OSN providers from interpreting user content or hide users’ social connections, which is not in the commercial interests of OSN providers. In contrast, we respect the interests of OSN providers while exporting privacy controls to users.

### Group Communication
Like Twitsper, listserv [30] enables communication between groups of users, but lacks a social structure and was not designed with privacy in mind. Prior implementations of group messaging on Twitter, such as Twitter Groups [20], GroupTweet [8], and Tweetworks [19], either do not focus on privacy or require users to join groups outside their existing social relationships. A recent workshop paper [43] advocated a wrapper for private group communication on Twitter but ignored the leakage of private information to the server maintained by the wrapper.

## 3. Motivating User Survey
While privacy concerns with OSNs have received significant coverage, the media has mostly focused on the leakage of user information to third parties. Our motivation is to address a more basic version of privacy—protecting content shared by a user from other users on the OSN, which has begun to receive attention [11].

To gauge the perceived need for this form of privacy, we conducted an IRB-approved user study with 78 Twitter users. The survey questioned participants about their privacy needs, the measures they have taken to protect their privacy, and the controls they would like to see introduced. Table 1 summarizes the results. More than three-fourths of the participants are concerned about the privacy of the information they post on Twitter, and a similar fraction would like better control over who sees their content. Half of the participants have at least once rejected requests to connect on Twitter to protect their privacy. These numbers highlight the necessity of enabling users to privately exchange messages with a subset of their followers, allowing them to choose which subset to share a message with on a per-message basis.

| Category | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Consider privacy a concern | 77% |
| Would like to control who sees information they post | 70% |
| Declined follower requests owing to privacy concerns | 50% |

## 4. Design Objectives
Given the need for enabling private group messaging on Twitter, we designed Twitsper to provide fine-grained privacy controls to Twitter users. Our overarching objective is to offer these controls without waiting for Twitter to make any changes. Our design for Twitsper is guided by three primary goals:

### Backward Compatibility
Rather than developing a new OSN, we want our solution to be compatible with Twitter. Twitter already has a large user base of over 100 million active users [21]. The value of a network grows quadratically with the number of users (the network effect [36]), so Twitter users have significant value locked into the service. To extract equal value from an alternate social network, users would need to re-add all their social connections and convince their contacts to shift to the new service. Therefore, we seek to provide better privacy controls by developing a wrapper around Twitter, eliminating the burden of migrating to a new OSN and maximizing the chances of widespread adoption of Twitsper.

### Preserves Commercial Interests
A key requirement for Twitsper is that it should not be detrimental to Twitter’s commercial interests. For example, while users can exchange encrypted messages on Twitter, this prevents Twitter from interpreting the content hosted on its service. Since Twitter is a for-profit entity offering free services, it is essential that Twitter can interpret user-contributed content for purposes such as showing relevant advertisements, recommending applications, and suggesting connections. While revealing user content to Twitter opens the possibility of data leakage, this can be mitigated through legal frameworks or information flow control. Our focus in building Twitsper is to protect user content from other users, not from Twitter itself.

### No Added Trust
In providing better controls without waiting for Twitter to change, we want to ensure that users do not need to trust another entity in Twitsper. Users already trust Twitter with their information, and increasing the number of trusted entities could deter adoption. Therefore, we seek to ensure that users do not need to share any protected information, such as content or login credentials, with Twitsper’s servers. Tools like TaintDroid [29] can verify that Twitsper’s client application does not leak such information. We design Twitsper for a setting where the servers are inquisitive listeners but not malicious, similar to the attacker model used in prior work [40].

Table 2 compares our proposal with previous solutions for improving user privacy on OSNs. Unlike distributed OSNs, Twitsper enables users to reuse their social connections on Twitter. Unlike calls for encrypted content, we respect Twitter’s commercial interests. Moreover, we introduce a solution that does not require additional trust from users.
