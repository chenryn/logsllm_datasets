ABSTRACT
User privacy has been an increasingly growing concern in online
social networks (OSNs). While most OSNs today provide some
form of privacy controls so that their users can protect their shared
content from other users, these controls are typically not sufﬁciently
expressive and/or do not provide ﬁne-grained protection of infor-
mation. In this paper, we consider the introduction of a new pri-
vacy control—group messaging on Twitter, with users having ﬁne-
grained control over who can see their messages. Speciﬁcally, we
demonstrate that such a privacy control can be offered to users of
Twitter today without having to wait for Twitter to make changes to
its system. We do so by designing and implementing Twitsper, a
wrapper around Twitter that enables private group communication
among existing Twitter users while preserving Twitter’s commer-
cial interests. Our design preserves the privacy of group informa-
tion (i.e., who communicates with whom) both from the Twitsper
server as well as from undesired Twitsper users. Furthermore,
our evaluation shows that our implementation of Twitsper im-
poses minimal server-side bandwidth requirements and incurs low
client-side energy consumption. Our Twitsper client for Android-
based devices has been downloaded by over 1000 users and its util-
ity has been noted by several media articles.

INTRODUCTION
OSNs have gained immense popularity in the last few years since
they allow users to easily share information with their contacts and
to even discover others of similar interests based on information
they share. However, not all shared content is meant to be public;
users often need to ensure that the information they share is accessi-
ble to only a select group of people. Though legal frameworks can
help limit with whom OSN providers can share user data, users are
at the mercy of controls provided by the OSN to protect the content
they share from other users. In the absence of effective controls,
users concerned about the privacy of their information are likely
to connect with fewer users, share less information, or even avoid
joining OSNs altogether.
Previous proposals to address these privacy concerns on exist-
ing OSNs either (a) jeopardize the commercial interests of OSN

providers [31, 23] if these solutions are widely adopted and thus,
are likely to be disallowed, or (b) require users, who are currently
accustomed to free access to OSNs, to pay for improved privacy [26,
42, 3]. On the other hand, though new OSNs have been developed
with privacy explicitly in mind [16, 7], these OSNs have seen lim-
ited adoption because users are virtually “locked in" to OSNs on
which they have already invested signiﬁcant time and energy to
build social relationships. Consequently, users have, in many cases
today, raised privacy-related concerns in the media and organiza-
tions such as the EFF and FTC have tried to coerce OSNs to make
changes. Though OSNs have introduced new privacy controls in
response to these concerns (e.g., Facebook friend lists, Facebook
groups, Google+ circles), such controls do not provide sufﬁciently
ﬁne-grained protection.
In light of this, we consider the privacy shortcomings on Twit-
ter, one of the most popular OSNs today [17]. Twitter offers two
kinds of privacy controls to users—a user can either share a mes-
sage with all of her followers or with one of her followers; there
is no way for a user on Twitter to post a tweet such that it is visi-
ble to only a subset of her followers. In this paper, we ﬁll this gap
by providing ﬁne-grained controls to Twitter users, enabling them
to conduct private group communication. Importantly, we provide
this ﬁne-grained privacy control to Twitter users by implementing
a wrapper that builds on Twitter’s existing API, and hence, users do
not have to wait for Twitter to make any changes to its service.
As our main contribution, we design and implement Twitsper,
a wrapper around Twitter that provides the option of private group
communication for users, without requiring them to migrate to a
new OSN. Unlike other solutions for group communication on Twit-
ter [8, 19, 20], Twitsper ensures that Twitter’s commercial inter-
ests are preserved and that users do not need to trust Twitsper
with any private information. Further, in contrast to private group
communication on other OSNs (e.g., Facebook, Google+), in which
a reply/comment on information shared with a select group is typ-
ically visible to all recipients of the original posting, Twitsper
strictly enforces privacy requirements as per a user’s social connec-
tions (all messages posted by a user are visible only to the user’s
followers).
When designing Twitsper, we considered various choices for
facilitating the controls that we desire; surprisingly, a relatively
simple approach emerged as the best ﬁt for fulﬁlling our objec-
tives. Thus, our Twitsper implementation is based on this sim-
ple design which combines a Twitter client (that retains much of
the control logic) with a server that maintains minimal state. Im-
portantly, we ensure that no privately shared content is revealed
to the Twitsper server, and furthermore, the privacy of group
memberships is also preserved from both the Twitsper server
and from other undesired users. Our evaluation demonstrates that
this simple design does achieve the best trade-offs between several
factors such as backward compatibility, availability, client-side en-
ergy consumption, and server-side resource requirements.
Overall, our implementation of Twitsper is proof that users
can be empowered with ﬁne-grained privacy controls on existing
OSNs, without waiting for OSN providers to make changes to their
platform. Our client-side implementation of Twitsper for An-
droid phones has been downloaded by over 1000 users and several
articles in the media have acknowledged its utility in improving
privacy and reducing information overload on Twitter.
2. RELATED WORK
Characterizing privacy leakage in OSNs: Krishnamurthy and
Willis characterize the information that users reveal on OSNs [34]
and how this information leaks [35] to other entities on the web
(such as social application providers and advertising agencies). Our
thesis is that legal measures are necessary to ensure that OSN
providers do not leak user information to third-parties. However,
it is not in the commercial interests of OSN providers to support
systems that hide information from them. Therefore, we focus on
enabling users to protect their information from other undesired
users, rather than from OSN providers.
Privacy controls offered by OSNs: Google+ and Facebook per-
mit any user to share content with a circle or friend list comprising
a subset of the user’s friends. However, anyone who comments on
the shared content has no control; the comment will be visible to all
those with whom the original content was shared. Even worse, on
Facebook, if Alice comments on a friend Bob’s post, Bob’s post be-
comes visible to Alice’s friend Charlie even if Bob had originally
not shared the post with Charlie. Facebook also enables users to
form groups; any information shared with a group is not visible to
users outside the group. However, a member of the group has to
necessarily share content with all other members of a group, even
if some of them are not her friends. Twitter, on the other hand,
enables any user to restrict sharing of her messages either to only
all of her followers (by setting her account to private mode) or to
exactly one of her followers (by means of a Direct Message), but
not to a proper subset. We extend Twitter’s privacy model to permit
private group communication, ensuring that the privacy of a user’s
reply to a message shared with a group is in keeping with the user’s
social connections.
Distributed social networks: Several proposals to improve user
privacy on OSNs have focused on de-centralizing OSNs (e.g., Vis-
a-Vis [42], Conﬁdant [37], DECENT [33], Polaris [45], and Peer-
SoN [26]). These systems require a user to store her data in the
cloud or on her own or her friends’ personal devices, thus remov-
ing the need for the user to trust a central OSN provider. However,
users have put in tremendous effort in building their social connec-
tions on today’s OSNs [4, 17], and rebuilding these connections on
a new OSN is not easy. Thus, unlike these prior efforts, we build a
backward-compatible privacy wrapper on Twitter.
Improving privacy in existing OSNs: With Lockr [44], the
OSN hosting a user’s content is unaware of with whom a user is
sharing content; Lockr instead manages content sharing. Other sys-
tems allow users to share encrypted content, either by posting the
encrypted content directly on OSNs [31, 23, 24] or via out-of-band
servers [13]. Users can share the decryption keys with a select sub-
set of their connections (friends). Hummingbird [28] is a variant of
Twitter in which the OSN supports the posting of encrypted content
in such a manner that preserves user privacy. Narayanan et al. [39]
ensure users can keep the location information that they divulge
on OSNs private via private proximity testing. All of these tech-
niques either prevent OSN providers from interpreting user content,

or hide users’ social connections from OSNs. Since neither is in the
commercial interests of OSN providers, these solutions are not sus-
tainable if widely adopted. In contrast, we respect the interests of
OSN providers while exporting privacy controls to users.
Group communication: Like Twitsper, listserv [30] enables
communication between groups of users. However, unlike with
Twitsper, group communications on listserv lack a social struc-
ture and listserv was never designed with privacy in mind. Prior
implementations of group messaging on Twitter, such as Twitter
Groups [20], GroupTweet [8], and Tweetworks [19], have either not
focused on privacy—they require users to trust them with their pri-
vate information—or require users to join groups outside their ex-
isting social relationships on Twitter. Similar to Twitsper, a re-
cent workshop paper [43] advocated the use of a wrapper that offers
private group communication on Twitter, but unlike Twitsper,
they ignored the leakage of private information, such as the sizes of
conversation groups, to the server maintained by the wrapper.
3. MOTIVATING USER SURVEY
While privacy concerns with OSNs have received signiﬁcant cov-
erage [34, 35], the media has mostly focused on leakage of user
information on OSNs to third-parties such as application providers
and advertising agencies. Our motivation is the need for a more
basic version of privacy on OSNs—protecting content shared by a
user from other users on the OSN, which has began to receive some
attention [11].
To gauge the perceived need amongst users for this form of pri-
vacy, we conducted an IRB approved user study across 78 users
of Twitter 1. Our survey questioned the participants about the need
they see for privacy on Twitter, the measures they have taken to pro-
tect their privacy, and the controls they would like to see introduced
to improve privacy. Table 1 summarizes the survey results. More
than three-fourths of the survey participants are concerned about
the privacy of the information they post on Twitter, and an almost
equal fraction would like to have better control over who sees their
content. Further, rather tellingly, half the survey takers have at least
once rejected requests to connect on Twitter in order to protect their
privacy. These numbers motivate the necessity of enabling users on
Twitter to privately exchange messages with a subset of their fol-
lowers, speciﬁcally allowing them to choose which subset to share
a message with on a per-message basis.
4. DESIGN OBJECTIVES
Given the need for enabling private group messaging on Twitter,
we next design Twitsper to provide ﬁne-grained privacy con-
trols to Twitter users. Our over-arching objective in developing
Twitsper is to offer these controls to users without having to
wait for Twitter to make any changes to their service. Our design
for Twitsper is guided by three primary goals.
Backward compatible: Rather than developing a new OSN de-
signed with better user controls in mind (e.g., proposals for dis-
tributed OSNs [42, 26, 3]), we want our solution to be compatible
with Twitter. This goal stems from the fact that Twitter already has

an extremely large user base—over 100 million active users [21].
Since the value of a network grows quadratically with the growth
in the number of users on it (the network effect [36]), Twitter users
have huge value locked in to the service. To extract equal value
from an alternate social network, users will not only need to re-add
all of their social connections, but will further require all of their
social contacts to also shift to the new service. Therefore, we seek
to provide better privacy controls to users by developing a wrapper
around Twitter, eliminating the burden on users of migrating to a
new OSN and thus maximizing the chances of widespread adop-
tion of Twitsper.
Preserves commercial interests: A key requirement for
Twitsper is that it should not be detrimental to the commercial
interests of Twitter. For example, though a user can exchange en-
crypted messages on Twitter to ensure that she shares her content
only with those with whom she shares the encryption keys, this
prevents Twitter from interpreting the content hosted on its service.
Since Twitter is a commercial for-proﬁt entity and offers its service
for free, it is essential that Twitter be able to interpret content shared
by its users. Twitter needs this information for several purposes: to
show users relevant advertisements, to recommend applications of
interest to the user, and to suggest others of similar interest with
whom the user can connect. Though revealing user-contributed
content to Twitter opens the possibility of this data leaking to third-
parties (either with or without the knowledge of the provider), user
content can be insured against such leakage via legal frameworks
(e.g., enforcement of privacy policies [22]) or via information ﬂow
control [46]. On the other hand, protecting a user’s content from
other users requires enabling the user with better controls—our fo-
cus in building Twitsper.
No added trust: In attempting to give users better controls with-
out waiting for Twitter to change, we want to ensure that users
do not have another entity to trust in Twitsper; users already
have to trust Twitter with their information. Increasing the num-
ber of entities that users need to trust is likely to deter adoption
since users would fear the potentially greater opportunity for their
information to leak to third-parties. Therefore, we seek to ensure
that users do not need to share with Twitsper’s servers any in-
formation they want to protect, such as their content or their login
credentials. Tools such as TaintDroid [29] can be used to verify that
Twitsper’s client application does not leak such information to
Twitsper’s servers. We design Twitsper for the setting where
Twitsper’s servers are not malicious by nature, but are inquis-
itive listeners; this attacker model is similar to that used in prior
work (e.g., [40]).
Table 2 compares our proposal with previous solutions for im-
proving user privacy on OSNs. Unlike proposals for distributed
OSNs, Twitsper enables users to reuse their social connections
on Twitter, and unlike calls for exchange of encrypted content,
we respect Twitter’s commercial interests. Moreover, we intro-
