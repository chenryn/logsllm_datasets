# Data Quality

One of the most widely accepted definitions of data quality comes from Joseph M. Juran, author of [Juranâ€™s Quality Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Jurans-Quality-Handbook-Joseph-Juran/dp/007034003X/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GD9GCVSAQAHY7AC6XGC8). On page 998, he states:
> "Data are of high quality if they are fit for their intended uses in operations, decision making, and planning."

In simpler terms, if the data required for a specific task, such as a hunting engagement, does not meet the predefined requirements set by the team, it is not considered to be of high quality. This is because it fails to serve its intended purpose. Stephanie Zatyko from [Experian Data Quality](https://www.edq.com/blog/data-quality-vs-data-governance/) provides an illustrative analogy: if data were water, data quality would ensure that the water is clean and free from contamination.

Ensuring data quality is a critical activity that can significantly influence the success of a hunting engagement even before it begins. Identifying and addressing data quality issues early on can help proactively mitigate obstacles that might hinder the detection of adversarial techniques. Many teams overlook this step and end up spending weeks trying to understand why their queries do not return any results. Others mistakenly assume their environment is secure because their queries yield no results, when in fact, the issue may be that the necessary data is not being collected or is of poor quality.

## Data Quality Goals:

- **Reduce Time Spent on Data Issues:** Minimize the time hunters spend fixing and validating data, thereby increasing productivity during hunting engagements.
- **Improve Consistency:** Enhance consistency across data sources to facilitate more efficient data manipulation and enable more complex analytics that rely on multiple resources for additional context.
- **Enhance Automation:** Streamline automation processes to improve overall efficiency.

## Data Quality Dimensions:

Data quality dimensions are used to simplify the representation of measurable characteristics of data quality. There are various data quality dimensions defined, and their relevance depends on the intended use of the data. For a hunting program, I recommend referencing a few key dimensions from the ["DoD Core Set Of Data Quality Requirements"](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmitiq.mit.edu%2FICIQ%2FDocuments%2FIQ%2520Conference%25201996%2FPapers%2FDODGuidelinesonDataQualityManagement.pdf). These dimensions can help your team categorize and address gaps in the data intended for hunting purposes.

Some of these dimensions may be challenging to assess. Therefore, I recommend focusing on at least the following three dimensions:

- **Completeness:** Ensures that all necessary data elements are present.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that data is uniform and consistent across different sources.
- **Timeliness:** Ensures that data is available and up-to-date when needed.

Addressing these dimensions will provide a solid foundation for discussing data quality with the teams responsible for maintaining the data used in hunting engagements.
