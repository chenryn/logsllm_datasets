### Locality of Cellular Traffic and Content Delivery

The analysis reveals that a significant portion of cellular traffic is localized, meaning that users can typically access their content within a single Autonomous System (AS) hop. This is because the ASes of the examined Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are often peered with each other, facilitating efficient content delivery.

### Outsourcing Non-Popular Domains to Clouds

Our findings also indicate a trend towards outsourcing non-popular domains to cloud providers. This suggests that cloud providers have already captured a niche market in content hosting. As this trend continues, cloud providers will increasingly become de facto content providers, delivering a large amount of content that other ASes do not host. For example, Tencent has already launched a CDN service based on its cloud platform [4]. This shift may significantly alter the ecosystem of content hosting.

### Clustering Algorithm for Content Hosting Provider Identification

The proposed clustering algorithm provides a tool for identifying content hosting providers from large-scale passive DNS datasets. The analysis supports the notion that hosting providers are segmenting their infrastructure to deliver different types of content, thereby optimizing resource utilization and performance.

#### 4. Tracker Hosting Infrastructure

This section examines the hosting infrastructure of tracking domains, which are prevalent in mobile web services and mobile apps. Given the growing concern about privacy, it is crucial to understand the impact of content censorship on tracking behavior.

**4.1 Top Trackers**

We identified the top 10 tracking domains based on DNS query volume and their network features, as shown in Table 3. These domains account for 90% of total tracking queries, indicating a highly skewed distribution of tracking traffic. Surprisingly, only two of these tracking domains are based in China, with most located in the US. We hypothesize that the widespread use of Android phones and the availability of mobile third-party analytics libraries are key factors contributing to this observation [11].

**4.2 Tracker Hosting Infrastructure**

Next, we focused on the tracking servers (identified by IP addresses) that host these trackers. A server is classified as a tracking server if more than 10 tracking queries are resolved to its IP address. In total, 7,404 tracking servers were identified.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the ratio of tracking queries to all queries resolved to each server. We observe a bimodal distribution, where most tracking servers either deliver a very small ratio of tracking queries (i.e., < 20%) or a very high ratio (i.e., > 80%).

**Table 4. Top 10 ASes by Tracking Requests**

| **AS Name** | **ISP-AS1** | **ISP-AS2** | **Internap-B.4** | **Amazon-AES** | **% Tracking in Trace** | **% Tracking in AS** | **CDP** | **CMI** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Internap-B.4 | 35.27 | 24.10 | 7.96 | 7.01 | 5.64 | 3.89 | 2.96 | 2.32 |
| Amazon-AES | 1.04 | 1.89 | 0.77 | 54.79 | 100.00 | 25.29 | 3.84 | 14.77 |
| NTT | 27.28 | 34.33 | 1.74 | 0.09 | 0.30 | < 0.01 | 0.11 | < 0.01 |
| Akamai-ASN | 0.05 | 0.35 | 0.34 | 0.11 | 0.36 | < 0.01 | 0.17 | 0.16 |
| ISP-AS3 | 0.03 | 0.12 | 0.12 | 0.42 | 0.09 | 0.20 | - | - |
| ISP-AS4 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Amazon-02 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| GoogleCN | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |

Using a threshold of 0.9, we identified 52 ASes as exclusive tracking ASes. These include cloud providers (e.g., Internap, Carpathia) and owners of trackers that run their own ASes (e.g., Crashlytics).

**4.3 Summary and Discussion**

Our observations show that tracking queries are concentrated in a small number of trackers, most of which are US-based. Additionally, over 20% of tracking traffic goes out of China, raising privacy and cybersecurity concerns. The analysis also reveals that multiple types of infrastructures are used for tracker service hosting.

The bimodal distribution of the tracking query ratio indicates that 60% of tracking servers exclusively provide tracking services. Monitoring traffic to these servers could help identify new trackers. ISPs and mobile apps can use this information to block tracking activities for privacy and security reasons.

### Conclusion

This paper uses passive DNS traces from a Chinese cellular ISP to investigate the mobile content hosting infrastructure in China. We proposed a clustering algorithm to identify hosting providers and used content-related metrics to characterize the hosting infrastructure. Our key finding is that ISPs and hosting providers collaborate extensively to replicate popular content into cellular networks. In contrast, content from many non-popular and tracking domains tends to be available only in specific networks, leading to content monopolies.

Our findings align with global trends of close collaboration between ISPs and CDNs [1,12]. However, caution should be exercised when generalizing these findings to other countries. Our dataset was collected from a single cellular ISP over a two-day period. We are currently collecting DNS data from multiple ISPs over a longer observation period to provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date picture of the content hosting infrastructure in China.
