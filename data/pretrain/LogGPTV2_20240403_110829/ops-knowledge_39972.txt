User:  How to configure a network load balancer for high availability of web applications?
Assistant: The following are some common methods of network load balancer configuration to achieve high availability of web applications: 1. Integrate multiple web servers into the same internal network, assign them the same IP address, and deploy them in the internal network Network load balancer. 2. Configure the load balancer for session persistence. This prevents the user from being forwarded to a different web server, thereby avoiding the user from encountering any errors during the operation. 3. Use a load balancer for traffic distribution, and distribute requests to the most idle web servers, which can ensure that all servers are running within the load range. 4. Configure the load balancer for server health checks to automatically identify running servers as well as down servers and automatically redistribute traffic if necessary. 5. Use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) to cache static resources such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files in your web application. This helps reduce load, improve performance and reduce the risk of failures. 6. Create mirror servers that are identical to the web servers and take over traffic if any web server fails.
