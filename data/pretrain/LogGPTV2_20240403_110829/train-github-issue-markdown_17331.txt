# Bug report
## Describe the bug
I have a next.js app which uses exclusively static rendering. I recently
upgraded it to 9.2.0 and released it to production. Everything worked.
After several more commits, we started to see our script just not start
executing. That's how it looks. No console errors, no network errors, but none
of the script seems to run. We have ajax loading spinners that are baked into
the static html of the site by the build process, and that's all we see. The
ajax loads never happen. Apparently we are getting no script running.
"yarn dev" / localhost:3000 works fine. It's only when building production.
So I have a specific commit based on 9.2.0 that works, and a subsequent one
that does not. However, nothing about the commit where it broke has anything I
would ever suspect to be related to this. And if I go to our latest commit and
revert the one where the break starts, it is _still broken_.
It's as if it has more to do with the quantity of code than what the code is??
Taking all our changes but reverting to 9.1.7 resolves the issue. I tested
9.2.1 and it does NOT resolve the issue.
## To Reproduce
My challenge is how to give you a reproducible test case. I can't share my
code obviously and I don't know how to boil this down to something minimal
quite yet.
## Expected behavior
I'd like the benefits of 9.2.x and have my script keep working.
## Screenshots
Not sure these would help
## System information
  * OS: Win 10
  * Browser: Brave, Chrome, and IE11. We originally conflated this with an IE issue we were working on... we don't normally look at IE :)
  * Version of Next.js: 9.2.0
