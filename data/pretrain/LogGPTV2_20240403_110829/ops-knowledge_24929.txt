User: I'm a .NET developer who knows very little about Python, but want to give it a test drive for a small project I'm working on.
What tools and packages should I install on my machine? I'm looking for a common, somewhat comprehensive, development environment.
I'll likely run Ubuntu 9.10, but I'm flexible.  If Windows is a better option, that's fine too.
Edit: To clarify, I'm not looking for the bare minimum to get a Python program to run.  I wouldn't expect a newbie .NET dev to use notepad and a compiler. I'd recommend Visual Studio, NUnit, SQL Server, etc.
Assistant: Database: sqlite (inbuilt). You might want SQLAlchemy though.
GUI: tcl is inbuilt, but wxPython or pyQt are recommended.
IDE: I use idle (inbuilt) on windows, TextMate on Mac, but you might like PyDev. I've also heard good things about ulipad.
Numerics: numpy.
Fast inline code: lots of options. I like boost weave (part of scipy), but you could look into ctypes (to use dlls), Cython, etc.
Web server: too many options. Django (plus Apache) is the biggest.
Unit testing: inbuilt.
Pyparsing, just because.
BeautifulSoup (or another good HTML parser).
hg, git, or some other nice VC.
Trac, or another bug system.
Oh, and StackOverflow if you have any questions.
