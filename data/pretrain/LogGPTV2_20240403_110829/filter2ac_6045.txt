### Title: Building Synthetic Persons in Cyberspace for Enhanced Training and Simulation

One of the most significant challenges in developing proficient cyberspace operators is creating realistic training environments. While many organizations have made strides in replicating enterprise-scale networks, the critical issue remains: how to populate these networks with lifelike synthetic persons. Whether training network defenders or penetration testers, it is essential to pit them against adaptive and intelligent adversaries who can continuously challenge their skills. Additionally, a rich ecosystem is needed where realistic user agents exchange messages, interact with the web, and occasionally assist or hinder the efforts of both attackers and defenders.

In this talk, we present our research and development of a family of Cyberspace Cognitive (CyCog) agents designed to behave as attackers, defenders, or users within a network. The attacker agent (CyCog-A) is specifically developed to train defenders, while its defensive counterpart (CyCog-D) is intended to help develop penetration testers. The user agent (CyCog-U) is more versatile, capable of supporting both types of training. These synthetic users are modeled after real-world network users, enabling them to exhibit behaviors that can either hinder or assist attackers and defenders.

Our experiences and successes highlight current gaps and future opportunities. From the need for scalable cyberspace mapping techniques to our work in modeling behaviors, and the lessons learned in human-machine teaming, the CyCog family of agents is opening new dimensions in cyberspace operations research and development.
