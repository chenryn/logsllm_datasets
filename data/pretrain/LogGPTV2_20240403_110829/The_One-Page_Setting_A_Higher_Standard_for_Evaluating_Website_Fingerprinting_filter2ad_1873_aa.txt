ABSTRACT
To defeat Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks that threaten pri-
vacy on anonymity technologies such as Tor, defenses have been
proposed and evaluated under the multi-page setting. The multi-
page setting was designed as a difficult setting for the attacker and
therefore gives too much of an advantage to the defense, allowing
weak defenses to show success. We argue that all WF defenses
should instead be evaluated under the one-page setting so that the
defender needs to meet a higher standard of success.
Evaluating known WF defenses under the one-page setting, we
found that Decoy, Front and Tamaraw all failed to defend against
WF attacks. None of these defenses were shown to be vulnerable in
previous work. In Tamaraw’s case, the attacker’s TPR increases 13
times from 2.9% to 37% with 4.4% FPR; he can also achieve 91% TPR
and 21% FPR. We also found that these attacks were able to succeed
in a wide array of newly defined WF scenarios that could not be
captured by the standard laboratory scenario. In response, we create
the first defense that is strong enough for the one-page setting by
augmenting Tamaraw with greater randomization overhead so that
its anonymity sets are more evenly dispersed.

eavesdropper at a single location cannot capture both their iden-
tity and their behavior simultaneously. However, Tor is vulnerable
to traffic analysis attacks known as Website Fingerprinting (WF),
which allow an eavesdropper (including Tor’s volunteer nodes) to
determine the user’s activity from traffic patterns. WF attacks have
been repeatedly shown to achieve high recall and/or precision in a
large open-world setting [9, 11, 15, 17, 18].
On the other hand, there has been little success in work on
WF defenses — mechanisms to obfuscate web traffic so that WF
attackers cannot recognize them. As of yet, Tor does not use a
single WF defense, despite more than a decade of research and
implementation work. This is in large part due to the cat-and-
mouse game that characterizes research on defenses. A defense
would be published that shows success against all known attacks,
but it is soon followed by a new attack that defeats this defense,
necessitating work on a new defense. Tor developers are unlikely
to invest the technical effort necessary to maintain a defense that
may soon be defeated. Attempts have been made to break this
cycle by designing provably effective WF defenses that can defeat
any theoretical WF attack, but these defenses are prohibitively
expensive in overhead and less suitable for use in a popular (and
thus resource-strapped) anonymity network such as Tor.
In this work, we investigate the question: How should we show
that a WF defense is effective? We find that defenses have been
evaluated using a methodology that strongly favors the defender:
it requires the attacker to distinguish between a large number of
classes in the open world. This methodology was directly trans-
posed from research work on attacks where it was designed to
demonstrate attack effectiveness in a difficult setting. The same
setting that is difficult for an attacker becomes an easy setting for
defense evaluation. In the past, many defenses have been quickly
beaten by newer attacks; the low bar for defense evaluation may
explain why.
In reality, an attacker may only need to recognize accesses to a
single web page (which we call the one-page setting), and a defense
must still thwart that attempt. Our work re-evaluates WF defenses
using the one-page setting with the following main contributions:
(1) In the one-page setting, we find that attacks can achieve
high (>90%) TPR even against defenses that were not consid-
ered broken. We analyze defenses separately to explain how
they fail to cover visits to a page, particularly highlighting
limitations in current design paradigms.
(2) We newly define a number of realistic scenarios in which
the WF attacker’s success is not directly captured by the
standard laboratory scenario. We demonstrate that a realistic
WF attacker can achieve his goals even if the false positive
rate is much higher than the base rate. We also reveal a
Session 10D: Applied Privacy CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea2794number of important variables for attacker success that had
previously been ignored.
(3) We attempt to fortify WF defenses in the one-page setting by
exploring randomness and regularization options for several
defenses. In doing so, we find that some defense paradigms
have more potential to be fortified than others, and we are
able to create the first defense that succeeds in the one-page
setting (though with high overhead).
We organize the rest of the paper as follows. We give the back-
ground of Tor and Website Fingerprinting in Section 2, where we
also explain the weaknesses of the previous evaluation methodol-
ogy and our proposed one-page setting. In Section 3, we evaluate
WF defenses in the one-page setting. We define realistic scenar-
ios where an WF attacker can succeed against these defenses in
Section 4. Then, we explore improvements to these defenses in
Section 5. We discuss relevant issues in Section 6, give related work
in Section 7, and conclude with potential future work in Section 8.
2 BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY
2.1 Tor
Tor is a widely popular anonymity network designed for low-
latency internet usage such as web browsing [6]. By relaying client
traffic across multiple (volunteer) nodes with layered encryption,
Tor ensures that only the entry node contacted by the user knows
their identity, while only the exit node sees the end server. The
separation of identity and activity safeguards privacy, and eaves-
droppers on the network should not be able to link entry node
traffic with the true web server being visited.
2.2 Website Fingerprinting Attacks
In Website Fingerprinting (WF), a local eavesdropper (which may in-
clude the entry node) uses traffic analysis techniques on the client’s
traffic to deduce the web page they are visiting, thus compromising
Tor’s main guarantee of privacy. The threat of such traffic analysis
attacks against web privacy was studied before Tor [16], and was
considered a potential threat at Tor’s creation [6]. A large number of
attacks have demonstrated success against Tor in a large multi-class
open-world setting [1, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18]. Even in scenarios with very
low base rates, WF attacks can achieve high precision with almost
no false positives if a true positive rate trade off is acceptable [17].
We select three of the most effective attacks for evaluating de-
fenses in the one-page setting:
• k-Fingerprinting (kFP) [9]: A classifier based on random
forests, each forest being a multiple decision tree. The deci-
sion trees are trained on a large set of features such as packet
counts, inter-arrival times and burst patterns.
• CUMUL [11]: An SVM trained on cumulative packet size
sums, with outgoing packets from the client counting posi-
tively to the cumulative sum and incoming packets counting
negatively. Notable for using a small number of features
(104).
• Deep Fingerprinting (DF) [15]: A Convolutional Neural Net-
work taking packet directions as input; it is currently the
state-of-the-art attack.
While there may be other WF attacks based on deep learn-
ing [1, 13], these attacks are sufficient for our evaluation of defense
performance.
2.3 Website Fingerprinting Defenses
To harden Tor against these attacks, researchers have proposed a
number of WF defenses [2, 7, 8, 10, 12]. Broadly, defenses can be
classified into one of three types:
• Noise: adding dummy packets in a random fashion to dis-
rupt classification. Examples include Front [8], which adds
dummy packets according to a Rayleigh distribution focus-
ing on covering the front of the packet sequence, and WTF-
PAD [10], which adds dummy packets to attempt to mimic a
interpacket timing distribution.
• Mimicry: disguising the traffic of a page to look like that of
another page. An example is Decoy [12] randomly loading a
decoy web page whenever a real web page is loaded.
• Regularization: defining fixed rules and patterns for all web
traffic to follow in order to limit feature leakage. An example
is BuFLO [7] and the later improvement Tamaraw [2], which
stipulate fixed packet rates that all packet sequences must
follow, delaying real data and adding dummy packets as
necessary, as well as only allowing a sequence to end at
specified lengths to reduce leakage.
We focus on evaluating WTF-PAD, Front, Decoy, and Tamaraw in
this work as representative defenses from each type. Currently, no
WF attack has shown success against Front, Decoy, and Tamaraw.
2.4 Classification Basics
In the WF classification problem, the attacker (Oscar) obtains web
traffic traces by passive eavesdropping, and attempts to classify
them as positive (sensitive) or negative (non-sensitive) web page ac-
cesses. The attacker’s goal determines what he considers sensitive
and non-sensitive. We also refer to sensitive pages as monitored
pages and non-sensitive pages as non-monitored pages. For posi-
tive web page accesses, the attacker also wants to identify exactly
which page the client has visited. The problem to be solved by the
attacker is a hybrid between multi-class classification and binary
(sensitive/non-sensitive) classification, and we refer to it as the
multi-page open-world problem.
The client/defender (Alice) may try to obfuscate these traces to
thwart the attacker. Since the defender is aligned with the client,
we do not distinguish between them. A network-layer defender can
delay packets and insert new dummy packets at specific times. She
may do so based on which page the client is truly visiting.
On a multi-hop anonymity network such as Tor, the attacker sits
between the client and the first node. Since the first node can also
be an attacker, dummy packets are dropped by the second node.
Due to layered encryption, the attacker cannot read any packet,
which also means he cannot identify which packets are dummy
packets. He only knows the timing, size, and direction (to or from
the client) of each packet.
The attacker’s success is measured in his True Positive Rate
(TPR) (or recall) and his False Positive Rate (FPR). It may also be
measured in his precision, the percentage of positive classifications
that are true, keeping in mind the base rate, which is the client’s
Session 10D: Applied Privacy CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea2795chance of visiting a sensitive web page. The base rate is often low in
realistic WF scenarios. The defender wants to lower the attacker’s
TPR and precision.
2.5 The One-Page Setting
In previous work, WF defenses were evaluated according to:
(1) Their ability to reduce the recall (TPR) of known attacks, in
a multi-page closed-world or open-world setting;
(2) Their ability to reduce the precision of known attacks, in a
multi-page open-world setting.
In both cases, the number of positive classes was 100 or higher,
and there may be one negative class representing all non-monitored
pages. This setting was created to evaluate WF attacks; it is an
intentionally difficult setting to allow the attacker to prove his
general effectiveness [3, 18]. But the same settings were used to
evaluate website fingerprinting defenses [2, 8, 10, 18, 19], without
adjusting for the fact that the difficulty of the setting for the attack
makes it too easy for the defense to succeed.
In this work, we propose that WF defenses should be evaluated
under the one-page setting, where there is only one monitored
class and one non-monitored class. The monitored class represents
one page that the attacker is trained to identify. The attacker’s
success is measured in recall and precision, and the defender’s
objective is to lower both. To analyze the defense’s effectiveness
over a range of pages, we repeat the experiment with different
pages as the monitored class, taking the mean performance of the
attacker on these pages.
We give two main reasons why the one-page setting is preferable
to the multi-page setting for defense evaluation.
First, and most importantly, a defense should be designed to
meet a high standard of evaluation. This is a general principle of
security and privacy research. A defense that assumes conditions
unfavorable to the attacker can only be considered a partial defense.
Second, it is realistic for an attacker to want to monitor only one
web page, and that is sufficient to threaten user privacy. A one-page
attack can satisfy many use cases:
tain users or demographics;
• Targeted surveillance of a sensitive website to identify cer-
• A police force tasked with busting a drug trade network;
• Targeted campaigns (and/or harassment) of users visiting a
• A popular but embarrassing website that users would not
want to be identified as visiting, such as pornographic con-
tent;
• A website owner who only wants to track users accessing
certain website;
his own homepage.
Such an attack can have a chilling effect on users’ willingness to
use anonymity networks and thus erode trust in the technology.
2.6 TPR/FPR Tradeoff
Another aspect that a defense evaluation should include is the trade-
off between TPR and FPR. It is possible to trade off some of the high
TPR of known attacks for a lower FPR to achieve better precision by
rejecting low-confidence positive classifications [17]. For a defense
to claim success, it must take this into consideration as well: it
needs to be successful against the entire range of TPR/FPR values
an attack can achieve, considering potential tradeoffs.
We will find that for many scenarios, it is not necessary for FPR
to be lower than the base rate in the one-page setting, unlike the
multi-page setting. In fact, some attacks perform best when the
attacker maximizes his TPR (no tradeoff is performed). This is an
unexpected consequence of using the one-page setting, and we will
explore this in our evaluation.
3 DEFENSE EVALUATION
In the previous section, we argued for the importance of using the
one-page setting to analyze WF defense effectiveness. We apply
this new methodology to state-of-the-art defenses in this section.
In Section 3.2, we determine if these defenses are effective against
WF attacks. We find that under the one-page setting, all known
defenses, even higher-overhead ones, are unable to lower TPR
to a satisfactory degree. We investigate the TPR/FPR tradeoff in
Section 3.3, and we are able to reduce the FPR of lower-overhead
defenses below 1% while maintaining 90% TPR.
To understand why even the stronger defenses have failed, we
will also discuss how previous design paradigms interact with the
one-page setting. We separately analyze Decoy (Section 3.4) and
Tamaraw (Section 3.5) to determine why they fail in spite of previ-
ous work.
