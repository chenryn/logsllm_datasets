help reduce the base latency, which would be beneficial to many
applications. However, as discussed above, for many applications,
the base latencies are already short enough, so it is not clear what
benefits an extensive investment in edge deployment would bring.
It should be stressed that our analysis focuses on network per-
formance issues, and other considerations for edge, such as locality,
privacy, etc., are beyond our current scope. As our results show little
compelling technical reasons aiding large edge deployments, these
non-technical factors should be the focus of future investigations.
8 CONCLUSION
Over the past decade, cloud providers have made significant invest-
ments for widening their global infrastructure by deploying new
datacenters and expanding their private WANs to become much
closer to their clients. Furthermore, cloud providers also employ
services of colocation facilities and private interconnects hosting
their edge PoPs that allows tenant traffic to completely bypass
public Internet paths. In this work, we investigate the impact of
such cloud advances on overall access latencies for real Internet
users globally. Our results show that cloud performance is almost
consistent and comparable across providers in continents hosting
developed countries due to significant datacenter availability. In
developing regions, user latency to the cloud is largely sub-optimal
and highly influenced by geographical distance. It is also within
these regions, the effects of investments in private WAN and direct
ISP peering are more pronounced, as the cloud providers can de-
liver consistent (and in some areas lower) latencies. Finally, we find
that the wireless last-mile is still the primary bottleneck in user
cloud access irrespective of the geographical region, hinting at the
significant room for research for improving wireless performance.
