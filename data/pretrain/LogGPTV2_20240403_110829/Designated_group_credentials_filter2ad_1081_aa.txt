ABSTRACT
Consider a situation where a secret agent wants to authen-
ticate herself to the other secret agents. This secret agent
must be able to convince the others of her identity. She
cannot convince any other people other than those predeter-
mined secret agents. This is to avoid problems that might
occur if this secret agent would like to ‘betray’ her group.
On the whole we would like to allow the agent to convince
a predetermined group of people by showing that she holds
a credential and so she is a member of the group. However
we would like to prohibit this agent from convincing any
other people outside the group. We also need to ensure that
the party who has been convinced by the credential cannot
use this information to convince any third party. We call
this type of scheme as Designated Group Credential. In this
paper, we ﬁrst show a model of designated group creden-
tial systems followed by an eﬃcient construction based on
pairing-based cryptography. We also provide security proof
of our scheme based on the random oracle model.

predetermined by the authority during the credential gener-
ation process. The user can use the credential to convince
this group of people. For example Alice can obtain a creden-
tial (a statement of a designated type that attests to one or
more of the user’s attributes) from an authority Charlie, and
then show it to another user, Bob, in a group. Thus Bob
will be convinced that Alice has the credential authorized
by Charlie. Additionally, Bob cannot convince anyone else
that Alice indeed has the authorized credential. Moreover,
Alice can only convince a person of her credential iﬀ this
person belongs to a group speciﬁed by Charlie.
Consider a situation where the credential system is ap-
plicable. A new secret agent is sent to join a group of secret
agents. The new secret agent is given a credential by the
head of the department, so that she can convince any mem-
ber of the group to believe that she is a legitimate agent.
However, the agent cannot convince any party who does not
belong to the group that she is indeed an agent; and the
secret agents in this group are also unable to convince any
other party about her identity.
In this scenario, our credential system helps both the new
secret agent and the credential issuer from the head of the
department to protect their identities by designating the
group of secret agents to be the only credential veriﬁers.
With this designation, neither a dishonest secret agent who
carries the credential nor any dishonest secret agent from
the secret agent group can prove to a third party about the
validity of the credential. Hence even if a secret agent is
being interrogated for the credential, the identities of the
new secret agent and the credential issuer are still a secret.
To sum it up, our credential scheme has the following
properties:
• The authority can issue a valid credential to a person
A, together with a set of receivers, R, whom the person
can convince about her credential.
• The credential holder, A, can verify the authenticity of
the credential that she has received from the authority.
• The credential holder, A, can only convince another
person, B, about her credential, if and only if B is
in the group R (designation property of the credential
system).
• Receiving a convincing statement from the credential’s
holder A, any party in R will believe with the authen-
ticity of the credential, but any party in R cannot con-
vince any other third party about this fact (designated
property of the credential system).

The model of the credential scheme involves three parties,
namely a credential issuer, a credential holder and the des-
ignated veriﬁer. Our scheme is an adaptation of the Univer-
sal Designated Veriﬁer Signature (UDVS) scheme proposed
in [14]. However, the UDVS scheme proposed in [14] allows
the signature holder (or the credential holder) to convince
any receivers of her choice. Thus it is not suitable for our
model.
In addition to presenting the scheme, we oﬀer a
formal notion of secure credential and prove that our con-
struction satisﬁes the formal deﬁnition of security. Both the
deﬁnition of the credential system and the analysis that our
scheme satisﬁes to it are novel, which constitute the core of
our contributions.
Roadmap
In Section 2, we review some related work in this area, to-
gether with some preliminaries required throughout the pa-
per. In Section 3, we begin with a formalization of the no-
tion of the credential system. In Section 4, we provide our
construction based on bilinear pairings. We show that our
construction satisﬁes the security notions deﬁned in Section
3. We provide our security proof based on the random oracle
model. Finally, section 5 concludes the paper.
2. RELATED WORK
The notion to allow two parties to secretly identify each
other has been studied in the literature [3, 6, 7, 9, 12]. An
Oblivious Signature Based Envelope (OSBE) scheme [12]
enables the sender to send a message with the assurance
that can only be seen by the receiver iﬀ the receiver has ap-
propriate certiﬁcates. At the same time this should protect
the receiver’s privacy such that the sender does not know
whether the receiver has the required certiﬁcates or not.
OSBE performs access control on a message in an oblivious
way. In OSBE, the policy required is that the receiver holds
appropriate certiﬁcates.
One related notion to OSBE is Fair Exchange of Signa-
tures (FES) [1]. FES protocols are useful in contract sign-
ing. There are several distinct diﬀerences between OSBE
and FES. The signatures involved in OSBE are not gener-
ated by the two parties involved in the protocols, but rather
they are generated by certiﬁcation author.
To protect a sensitive policy, Hidden Credential systems
were introduced [9]. In Hidden Credential systems, when the
sender encrypts a message using a public key, he does not
need to specify which public key that has been used. The
receiver must then attempt decryption using each of her cre-
dentials. Although this can be computationally ineﬃcient,
it ensures that if she does not have the correct credentials,
then she learns almost nothing about the policy controlling
access to the message [6, 9].
Secret Handshakes [3] aim to allow members of the group
to identify each other. Secret Handshakes ensure that non-
members cannot recognize the handshake and hence are not
able to recognize group members. Besides, non-members
cannot perform the handshake and so they are unable to tri-
ﬂe group members to think that they are also members. This
notion has been extended to k-Anonymous Secret Hand-
shakes in [16]. A construction of Secret Handshakes without
incorporated pairing based cryptosystem has been consid-
ered in [7].
The concept of designated signature scheme was intro-
duced by Jakobsson, Sako and Implagliazzo in [10]. This sig-
nature scheme is the ﬁrst non-interactive undeniable signa-
ture scheme that transforms Chaum’s signature scheme [8]
into non-interactive veriﬁcation using a designated veriﬁer
proof. This scheme can be used to convince a single third
party, namely the designated veriﬁer. The designated veri-
ﬁer is the only person who can be convinced of its validity or
invalidity. This is due to the ability of the designated veriﬁer
to generate a signature intended to himself that is indistin-
guishable from an original signature. The formal model of
designated veriﬁer proof and constructions from any bilinear
maps are provided in [11].
An Universal Designated Veriﬁer Signature (UDVS) scheme
[14] generalized the above notion by allowing anyone who
obtains a signature to designate it. The term universal refers
to the ability of anyone to perform this action (in contrast
to the construction in [10] which only allows the signer to
designate his signature). The need of this signature scheme
is motivated by a scenario where Alice, who is a certiﬁcate
holder, would like to convince Bob that she has the certiﬁ-
cate. However she does not want Bob to obtain this certiﬁ-
cate. The certiﬁcate was signed by a CA, and Alice needs to
transform this certiﬁcate to a designated veriﬁer signature,
which can only be used to convince Bob. The reason behind
this is similar to designated veriﬁer scheme of [10]. This is
due to the fact that Bob can always generate the signature
intended to himself and this signature will be indistinguish-
able from an original signature. A construction of an UDVS
scheme based on the BLS short signature scheme [5] was
proposed in [14]. They also generalized this construction
to a standard Schnorr and RSA signature scheme in [15].
Recently, the notion of interactive UDVS scheme (which is
called Universal Designated Veriﬁer Signature Proof) was
proposed in [2]).
2.1 Preliminaries
Basic Concepts of Bilinear Pairings
Let G1 and G2 be two cyclic groups with the same prime
order q where the discrete logarithm problem in Z∗q is in-
tractable. We deﬁne G1 as a subgroup of an additive cyclic
group of points on an elliptic curve, and G2 as a subgroup
of a multiplicative cyclic group of a ﬁnite ﬁeld. A bilinear
map ˆe : G1 × G1 → G2 is deﬁned over G1 and G2 with the
following properties:
1. Bilinear : ˆe(aP1, bP2) = ˆe(P1, P2)ab, ∀P1, P2 ∈ G1, a,
b ∈ Z∗q
2. Non-degenerate : for all generator P ∈ G1, ˆe(P, P ) =
1(the identity in G2)
3. Computable : ∀P1, P2 ∈ G1, there exists an eﬃcient
algorithm to compute ˆe(P1, P2)
Note that we also have ˆe(P1 + P2, P ) = ˆe(P1, P )ˆe(P2, P )
from the properties above, such bilinear map that satisﬁes all
these properties is called an admissible bilinear map. Modi-
ﬁed Weil pairing is an admissible bilinear map that has been
used frequently in recent cryptography applications [4,5,13].
Complexity Assumptions
Let G1 be an additive cyclic group with generator P and G2
be a multiplicative cyclic group, both with the same prime
order q, and there also exists an eﬃciently computable ad-
missible bilinear map ˆe : G1 × G1 → G2 as deﬁned above
with all the properties. We review the Diﬃe-Hellman prob-
lems in G1 below:
0
Definition 1. Decision Diﬃe-Hellman Problem
(DDHP) in G1
Given an instance (P, aP, bP, cP ) where P is a generator
∈ G1 and a, b, c ∈ Z∗q are chosen uniformly at random, the
goal for an attacker A is to decide whether c = ab mod q.
DDHP is solvable in G1, any attacker A can use a bilinear
map ˆe to verify if ˆe(P, cP ) = ˆe(aP, bP ) (since ˆe(P, cP ) =
ˆe(P, P )c and ˆe(aP, bP ) = ˆe(P, P )ab which implies c = ab
mod q) in polynomial time with any bilinear pairings.
Definition 2. Computation Diﬃe-Hellman Prob-
lem(CDHP) in G1
Given an instance (P, aP, bP ) where P is a generator ∈ G1
and a, b ∈ Z∗q are chosen uniformly at random, the goal for
an attacker A is to compute abP within polynomial time.
CDHP is said to be hard with an assumption that there
exists no polynomial time algorithms for any attacker A to
solve CDHP, such that the probability of success P r[A(P,
aP, bP ) = abP : P ∈ G1, a, b ∈R Z∗q ] is non-negligible.
G1 is called a Gap Diﬃe-Hellman Group in which CDHP
is hard while DDHP is easy. As discussed above, there exists
no polynomial time algorithms to solve CDHP with non-
negligible probability of success but DDHP can be solved in
polynomial time using an admissible bilinear map.
Definition 3. Bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman Problem
(BDHP) in G1, G2, ˆe
Given an instance (P, aP, bP, cP ) where P is a generator ∈
G1 and a, b, c ∈ Z∗q are chosen uniformly at random, the goal
for an attacker A is to compute ˆe(P, P )abc within polynomial
time.
BDHP is hard with an assumption that there exists no poly-
nomial time algorithms for any attacker A to solve BDHP,
such that the probability of success P r[A(P, aP, bP, cP ) =
ˆe(P, P )abc : P ∈ G1, a, b, c ∈R Z∗q ] is non-negligible. Note
that if CDHP can be solved (i.e. given (P, aP, bP ), abP
can be computed), then BDHP is also solved (by calculat-
ing ˆe(abP, cP ) from an instance (P, aP, bP, cP )). Hence we
say that BDHP is no harder than CDHP.
