##### Detailed description
Hi,  
I am able to generate a build which has linear KalmanFilter by including the
`'KalmanFilter': ['correct','predict']` in the opencv_js.config.py file and
running the python build command. Now I am trying to build a opencv js wasm
build with UnscentedKalmanFilter but not sure how to proceed. I have tried the
following steps:
##### Steps to reproduce
  1. Append `“-DOPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=/opencv_contrib/modules”` to cmd in `get_cmake_cmd` method in build_js.py to include the extra modules in the build.
  2. Add `js` under WRAP in `opencv_contrib/modules/tracking/CMakeLists.txt`.
  3. Added `using namespace cv::detail::tracking;` to `/opencv/modules/js/src/core_bindings.cpp`.
  4. Defined tracking as `tracking = {'AugmentedUnscentedKalmanFilterParams':['AugmentedUnscentedKalmanFilterParams'], 'UnscentedKalmanFilterParams': ['UnscentedKalmanFilterParams'], 'UkfSystemModel': ['measurementFunction','stateConversionFunction'], 'UnscentedKalmanFilter': ['correct','getErrorCov','getMeasurementNoiseCov','getState','predict'], }` and added tracking to the whitelist `white_list = makeWhiteList([core, imgproc, tracking]). Not sure the above definition is the correct one. ` in `/opencv/platforms/js/opencv_js.config.py`.
After following the above steps i did not get any errors but the final build
did not contain required `UnscentedKalmanFilter` module in it.
