Abstract
Lattice-based cryptography oﬀers some of the most attractive primitives believed to be resis-
tant to quantum computers. Following increasing interest from both companies and government
agencies in building quantum computers, a number of works have proposed instantiations of
practical post-quantum key exchange protocols based on hard problems in ideal lattices, mainly
based on the Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE) problem. While ideal lattices facilitate major
eﬃciency and storage beneﬁts over their non-ideal counterparts, the additional ring structure
that enables these advantages also raises concerns about the assumed diﬃculty of the underly-
ing problems. Thus, a question of signiﬁcant interest to cryptographers, and especially to those
currently placing bets on primitives that will withstand quantum adversaries, is how much of
an advantage the additional ring structure actually gives in practice.
Despite conventional wisdom that generic lattices might be too slow and unwieldy, we demon-
strate that LWE-based key exchange is quite practical: our constant time implementation re-
quires around 1.3ms computation time for each party; compared to the recent NewHope R-LWE
scheme, communication sizes increase by a factor of 4.7×, but remain under 12 KiB in each di-
rection. Our protocol is competitive when used for serving web pages over TLS; when partnered
with ECDSA signatures, latencies increase by less than a factor of 1.6×, and (even under heavy
load) server throughput only decreases by factors of 1.5× and 1.2× when serving typical 1 KiB
and 100 KiB pages, respectively. To achieve these practical results, our protocol takes advan-
tage of several innovations. These include techniques to optimize communication bandwidth,
dynamic generation of public parameters (which also oﬀers additional security against back-
doors), carefully chosen error distributions, and tight security parameters.

Introduction
Recent advances in quantum computing (cf. [26, 40]) have triggered widespread interest in develop-
ing practical post-quantum cryptographic schemes [49]. Subsequently, standards bodies and govern-
ment agencies have announced their intentions to transition to cryptographic standards that oﬀer
quantum-resistance; this includes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [51],
the National Security Agency (NSA) [52], and the PQCRYPTO project [9] funded by the European
Union.
Traditional number-theoretic cryptographic problems such as the integer factorization problem
and the discrete logarithm problem (over both multiplicative groups modulo a prime p and elliptic
curve groups) are vulnerable to polynomial-time quantum attacks [61, 57]. Lattice-based cryptog-
raphy, beginning with Ajtai’s seminal work [4] (cf. the recent survey [55] for a comprehensive list of
relevant references), is an exciting ﬁeld of research that, in addition to providing a richer diversity
of underlying primitives, oﬀers the potential to build practical quantum-resistant cryptography.
1.1 Key Exchange and Forward Secrecy
Although large-scale quantum computers are likely to aﬀect all of the cryptographic building blocks
used to secure the internet, the threat of quantum computing to each speciﬁc primitive diﬀers
signiﬁcantly. On the symmetric side, the cryptanalytic speedups (using Grover’s algorithm [34])
aided by a quantum computer are well-understood.
It is currently believed that it will suﬃce
to double the secret key sizes of symmetric encryption algorithms and MACs to defend against
quantum computers.
On the asymmetric side, cryptographers are currently examining the potential of a new range
of mathematical problems (like those based on lattices) for post-quantum security. While there
are several interesting candidates for post-quantum signature schemes, a more pressing concern to
practitioners is the deployment of post-quantum public key encryption and key exchange protocols:
the secrecy of today’s communications can be compromised by a quantum computer that is built
decades into the future (by an attacker who stores these communications until then); on the other
hand, authentication can only be forged at connection time.
In this paper, we focus on the most pressing issue in public key post-quantum cryptography:
the development of a secure, practical key exchange protocol that can be used to secure internet
traﬃc in anticipation of a quantum adversary. This focus on (quantum-secure) key exchange aligns
with the notion of forward secrecy [28] deployed in TLS and, for example, the notion of long-term
security used for classiﬁed documents by government agencies (see Table 4 in [11]).
1.2 Generic vs. Ideal Lattices
Public-key cryptography is built on the presumed diﬃculty of hard computational problems. When-
ever such a problem is introduced and has potential as a cryptographic primitive, cryptographers
naturally study whether there are special instances of the problem that oﬀer practical beneﬁts, and
in particular, whether they do so without compromising the presumed hardness. There are several
historic examples of special instances that have proven to be a disastrous choice compared to suit-
ably chosen random instances, e.g., the use of supersingular curves in elliptic curve cryptography
(ECC) [47, 30]. In some cases, special instances introduce well-understood security issues that can
be weighed against potential beneﬁts, e.g., the use of small public exponents in RSA [22]. In many
scenarios, however, the size of such a security gap, or whether there is a gap at all, remains unclear.
One example of an unknown security gap currently exists in lattice-based cryptography. Five
years after Regev’s paper introducing the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem was published [58],
3
Lyubashevsky, Peikert and Regev [46] introduced a specialized version of the problem called Ring
Learning With Errors (R-LWE), which oﬀers signiﬁcant storage and eﬃciency improvements. LWE
is a mature and well-studied [7, 45, 48, 16] cryptographic primitive that relies only on the worst-case
hardness of a shortest vector problem in generic lattices. R-LWE has additional algebraic structure
and relies on the (worst-case) hardness of problems in ideal lattices. Ideal lattices correspond to
ideals in certain algebraic structures, such as polynomial rings. NTRU lattices [36], which are a
class of lattices with some structure (but diﬀerent from R-LWE lattices) have also been used to
build cryptosystems.
The hardness of lattice problems on regular lattices as well as ideal lattices merits more study.
Although the algebraic structure of R-LWE (and NTRU) makes for more practical key-sizes and
protocol communication, this algebraic structure might inspire less conﬁdence in the underlying
security. Currently, the best algorithms to solve hard problems in ideal lattices [21, 44] are the
same as those that target regular lattices (modulo small polynomial speedups), and it is not known
whether the R-LWE problem is signiﬁcantly easier than the LWE problem for the same parameter
sizes. Certain sieving algorithms obtain a constant factor time and/or space improvement in the
ideal case [60, 15], but (at best) this only shaves a few bits oﬀ of the known bit-security. At the
very least, however, the additional ring structure might introduce subtleties in the choice of error
distribution [56].
Several recent papers [54, 14, 65, 6] have proposed and implemented key exchange variants that
rely on the hardness of the R-LWE problem [46]. In contrast, in this paper we develop and evaluate a
secure and practical key exchange protocol from the original LWE problem [59], the security of which
is based on hard problems in lattices that do not possess any ring structure. While both academic [9]
and government [19, 50] bodies are currently exploring candidates for post-quantum cryptography,
we believe it prudent to give a concrete evaluation of a lattice-based scheme that is invoked without
the additional structure, and to draw comparisons to previous ring-based implementations. The
design of our implementation and its accompanying security analysis was performed with a view
towards real-world (and in particular, internet) deployment. To our knowledge, there has not yet
been a practical implementation of key exchange based on the original LWE problem.
1.3 Our Contributions
We demonstrate the feasibility of LWE-based key exchange with a new key exchange protocol which
we call “Frodo,” and we provide a proof of its security based on the original LWE problem. We give
parameter sets for LWE at several security levels, including “recommended” parameters that achieve
128-bit security against quantum adversaries (using the best known attacks that incorporate recent
advances in lattice cryptanalysis), and “paranoid” parameters that are based on lower bounds for
sieving algorithm complexities. Our protocol incorporates several innovations:
• Eﬃciently sampleable noise distribution. We present four discrete noise distributions that
are more eﬃcient to sample than previously used discrete Gaussian distributions (without
increasing the lattice dimensions); the safety of using these in place of rounded continuous
Gaussians follows from analyzing the corresponding Rényi divergence.
• Eﬃcient and dynamic generation of public parameters. We generate the LWE public matrix A
for every key exchange from a small random seed, which has two beneﬁts. Using a new A with
every connection avoids the use of global parameters that can lead to “all-for-the-price-of-one”
precomputation attacks, such as the Logjam attack on ﬁnite-ﬁeld Diﬃe–Hellman [1] (we note
that these attacks have the potential to be even more devastating in the context of lattices
– see [6]). Furthermore, in LWE this approach gives rise to signiﬁcant bandwidth savings,
since we avoid the transmission of the large matrix A by instead transmitting the small seed.
4
While this approach was already explored in the context of R-LWE in [6], in the context of
LWE it becomes more challenging due to the large amount of randomness that is required.
A signiﬁcant step towards achieving high performance was optimizing this pseudorandom
generation of A, since in our case it still consumes around 40% of the total computation time
for each party. In order to target a large number of platforms and applications, we optimized
this step for memory-access patterns; pseudorandom construction of A from a small random
seed is done component-wise so that devices with memory constraints can generate blocks of
A, use them, and discard them.
Implementation. We provide an open-source implementation of our protocol in the C language
that provides protection against simple timing and cache-timing attacks. We have integrated our
implementation, as well as publicly available implementations of several other post-quantum key
exchange protocols [14, 6, 64, 24], to allow a direct comparison of post-quantum candidates in
a common framework. We have also integrated our framework into OpenSSL, allowing it to be
used with Apache for performance testing in real-world settings. In addition, we implemented and
evaluated the hybrid version of each ciphersuite; this partners each of the proposed post-quantum
key exchange primitives with ECDHE in order to mitigate the potential of (classical) cryptanalytic
advances against the newer primitives.
The implementation of our protocol and parameter ﬁnding scripts are available at https://
github.com/lwe-frodo/. Our framework for comparing post-quantum algorithms and integration
into OpenSSL is available at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.
Performance comparison and evaluation in TLS. We evaluate the performance of our protocol,
along with the other post-quantum protocols mentioned above, in two ways:
• Microbenchmarks. These measure the performance of standalone cryptographic operations.
Using LWE key exchange at the “recommended” security level, each party’s operations run in
around 1.3ms. As expected, this is slower but still comparable to ideal lattice-based schemes
(they have runtimes between 0.15ms—2.15ms per party), but it is signiﬁcantly faster than the
post-quantum software based on supersingular isogenies [24], and is comparable to traditional
elliptic curve Diﬃe–Hellman using nistp256 (which takes about 0.7ms per party). Table 4
contains detailed comparisons.
• Performance within HTTPS/TLS. To measure the real-world impact of using generic lattices,
we measure the connection time and server throughput when using post-quantum ciphersuites
in TLS. This includes their performance under heavy sustained load while serving hundreds
of connections every second.
In this realistic scenario, the performance gap between ideal
and generic lattices shrinks considerably. When ECDSA certiﬁcates are used, the time to
establish a connection using our LWE key exchange ciphersuite is just 18.3ms (or 23ms when
deployed in a hybrid mode with ECDHE). The handshake size is around 23.1 KiB. Compared
to NewHope [6] (which is a very fast R-LWE based scheme), we see that using generic lattices
in our case gives rise to just a factor 1.5× increase in latency (12.1ms or 16.5ms in hybrid
mode), and a factor 4.7× increase in handshake size (4.9 KiB). Given that modern web pages
load with latencies of hundreds of milliseconds and with sizes of a megabyte or more, the
overhead of LWE key exchange is manageable in many cases and unnoticeable in many more.
We measured connections per second at a variety of page sizes (see Table 5): at 100 KiB, the
throughput of LWE is only 1.2× less than that of NewHope, and this drops to just 1.15×
