User: How to control and manage the remote server through SSH, and use tools such as PuTTY to establish a secure SSH connection?
Assistant: 1. First, you need to install the SSH service on the server, which can be achieved by the following command: ``` sudo apt-get install openssh-server ``` 2. Confirm that the firewall has opened the SSH port (the default is 22), if it is not open, you need to Enable it with the following command: ``` sudo ufw enable sudo ufw allow ssh ``` 3. Install PuTTY and other SSH client tools on the local computer, open the software, and fill in the corresponding IP address and SSH port of the remote server to be connected in the options. 4. Copy the public key on the local computer to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server, which can be achieved by the following command: ``` ssh-copy-id username@remote_host ``` where `username ` is the user name for logging in to the remote server, and `remote_host` is the IP address or domain name of the remote server. 5. Use tools such as PuTTY to connect to the remote server, and log in to control and manage the remote server. At this time, the connection is encrypted using the public key, and the security is guaranteed. It should be noted that in order to prevent SSH login from being attacked, some security measures need to be followed. For example, disable SSH root login, use complex passwords, restrict IP addresses, etc.
