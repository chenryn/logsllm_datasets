English is good but I can't type anything with Korean. I can copy and paste
the text, but cannot type it. It feels like it just doesn't support Korean
input. I can see text output so maybe it would not be a problem with fonts.
# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.267]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): Windows Terminal (Preview) 0.3.2171.0
The font was Consolas.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open any type of terminal.
  2. change system language like usual
  3. (with 한/영 key (language change key), or click the language change button on the taskbar)
  4. write some text.
# Expected behavior
I can write Korean text to the terminal
# Actual behavior
I cannot write Korean text to the terminal
