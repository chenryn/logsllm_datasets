In our project we have a number of files where tabs are strictly required (a
format we do not control). However, we want to normalize tabs to spaces
throughout the rest of the project.
For now, I just ask that people don't edit those files in VSCode. I even
considered adding them to the ignore list for VSCode itself. But it's not
uncommon to have file-specific settings, so I thought it would be nice if
VSCode allowed for more complex patterns - much like `files.exclude`, perhaps
something like:
    "editor.insertSpaces": true,
    "diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace": true,
    "files.settings": {
      "**/*.idt": {
        "editor.insertSpaces": false,
        "diffEditor.ignoreTrimWhitespace": false
      }
    }
