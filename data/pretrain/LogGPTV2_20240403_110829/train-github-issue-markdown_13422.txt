I have a hard time replicating this issue since it will require me filling up
the disk again, but in a nutshell the problem is that when I edit a file in
Atom, if the disk space is not enough to save it, I find that the file content
is erased.
This happened to me more than once (yeah I need more Gbs of disk space) so I
can certify that it is Atom the one causing the issue. The issue appears
whenever I edit the file, not when I just open it. The problem is not that
Atom is not being able to save the file (that would make sense if there is no
disk space available), the problem is that Atom _removes all the content_ ,
and of course I'm afterwards not able to recover it.
I have no clue of why may this be happening
