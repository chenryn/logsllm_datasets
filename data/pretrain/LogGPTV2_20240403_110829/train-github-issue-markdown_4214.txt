Seems fixing the bug from #4521 created a new bug for :checked="" binding when
using in combination with vuex states for maintaining checkbox states.
In this code example is :checked set to true or false whenever it's in the
active filter array.  
It seems when this component is updated (via vuex) the :checked stated doesn't
get's updated like in 2.1.6. In my application is the state managed _almost_
totally by Vuex.
### Vue.js version
2.1.7+
### Reproduction Link
http://vroom.automotivated.nl/
### Howto reproduce
When selecting several checkboxes (like brands) and use your **browser back
button** to fallback to previous states. (it's managed by the popstate event
and uses vuex actions to update actively the new state)
### What is expected
The checkbox should go on or off depending on the previous action or new
current state.
### What is actually happening?
Everything get's correctly updated (value wise), except the checkbox isn't
honored to update (checked true/false). It keeps in a previous state. When
selecting multiple after eachother and navigating back and forward is looks
like is off a beat and missing the last changed checkbox.
Code that goes with it:

While reading the docs in Vuex, it seems to be best practise to do it like I
did.
### When did it work
It worked like a charm in 2.1.6. Seems really that fixing this bug triggered
this bug to be created.
