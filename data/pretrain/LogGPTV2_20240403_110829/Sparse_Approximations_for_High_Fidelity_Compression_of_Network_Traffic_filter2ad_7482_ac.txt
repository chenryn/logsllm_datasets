### Stopping Criteria for Compressed Representations

The stopping criteria for obtaining compressed representations are defined based on the relative error and the number of coefficients used.

### 6.3 Analysis of Selected Modes

We analyze the set of dictionary components chosen in the compressed representation using redundant dictionaries for different ports, along various spatial and temporal dimensions.

1. **Similarity Across Different Ports:**
   - We examine if there is substantial similarity in the set of dictionary components selected in the compressed representation across different ports.

2. **Temporal Properties of Compression:**
   - For a fixed traffic dimension, we observe how one week differs from another in terms of the components selected from the redundant dictionary.

3. **Correlation Across Traffic Aggregates:**
   - We identify possible sources of correlation across different traffic aggregates (flows, packets, bytes, both to and from) on a particular port of interest.

This analysis helps us understand the nature of the underlying constituent components that make up each traffic time series and enables us to identify possible sources of joint compression, further reducing storage requirements. For this section, we use the dictionary DF +S (Fourier + Spike) as the redundant dictionary for our analysis.

### 6.3.1 Spatial Analysis Across Ports

We observe that the majority of selected dictionary components are restricted to a small number of ports. This is expected as these modes capture minor variations across different ports and represent traffic spikes that may be isolated incidents specific to each port. A few components are consistently selected across almost all ports. These include the mean (zero-th Fourier component), diurnal/off-diurnal periodic components, and other high-energy periodic components identified in Section 6.1.

### 6.3.2 Temporal Analysis Across Multiple Weeks

We analyze the temporal stability of the set of components selected across different weeks over a 20-week dataset, using 30 modes per week. We use DF +S as the redundant dictionary for compression. For each dictionary component (periodic component or spike) selected in the compressed representation over the 20-week period, we count the number of weeks it is selected. Figure 10 shows the number of components that have an occurrence count more than \( x \) as a function of \( x \). We observe that the majority of components are selected only for 1-2 weeks, indicating subtle traffic variations from week to week.

To further understand the stability of the components, we categorize them into three groups:
- Components that occur every week.
- Components that occurred greater than 50% of the time (selected 10-20 times over the 20-week period).
- Components that occurred fewer than 50% of the time (selected fewer than 10 times).

Table 2 presents the breakdown of these categories.
