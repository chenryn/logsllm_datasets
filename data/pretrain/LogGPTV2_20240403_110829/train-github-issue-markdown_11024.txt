Hi,
I´m working in a laravel app and i´m trying to make a post request from a Vue
JS component like laravel method, so when i make the post request i would like
the app go to the url received from the laravel controller on the http post
response. I have the next code in my vue JS component methods:
    submit: function() {
                    const data = {
                        name: this.name,
                    };
                    console.log('submit!')
                    this.$v.$touch()
                    if (this.$v.$invalid) {
                        this.submitStatus = 'ERROR'
                    } else {
                        let currentObj = this;
                        axios.post('/group', data).then(function (response) {
                            currentObj.output = response.data;
                        }).catch(function (error) {
                            currentObj.output = error;
                        });
                    }
                },
When i execute the code, the post request is done, i have the data sent on my
database tables, however, the application is not redirected as i expect.
How the app can be redirected to the URL returned on laravel controller
method?
