For example:
    #![feature(rustdoc)]
    extern crate rustdoc;
    use rustdoc::html::markdown::Markdown;
    fn main() {
        let x = "This program makes a variable binding named `x`.";
        println!("{}", Markdown(x));
    }
This code runs fine in the playpen (http://is.gd/HVGloB) and when using the
official nightly (`rustc -V`  
`rustc 1.3.0-nightly (bf3c979ec 2015-06-30)`). Expected output:
    This program makes a variable binding named x.
However, I compiled Rust on my machine (`rustc -V` `rustc 1.3.0-dev (71a644136
2015-07-02)`) and I get the following output instead:
    This program makes a variable binding named x`x`.
Needless to say, this is wreaking havoc on the generated docs, which I'm
trying to test before I submit any significant pull requests for rustdoc or
rustbook issues.
I'm running Windows 7 64-bit and I'm using MSYS2 to run `./configure` and
`make`.
Any ideas? Or perhaps this is actually an issue with Hoedown?
