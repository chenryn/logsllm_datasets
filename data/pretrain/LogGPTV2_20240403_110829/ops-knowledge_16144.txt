User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Samba setup to request password reset on first time login Is it possible to setup Samba to ask for password reset when the user first logs in without the need to setup a domain controller?
Would this work properly with Windows clients or with clients using Linux with file managers like Krusader or Nautilus?
Could somebody give me a few pointers how to implement this if is possible?
I'm pretty new to Samba and I use it as a file server and I would like to have such a feature on it, but I'm not sure if it's possible. Thanks!

Assistant: @crazybyte, @Nexus: Of course this is possible. See the explanation of passwd chat and passwd program parameters in man smb.conf.
