Is there currently a way to run a locally built npm executable script using
`deno run`. I'm thinking of something like this:
    deno run --allow-env --allow-read npm:
The scenario is running node code that we don't to publish to a public
repository.
I discovered the `createRequire` method, e.g.
    import { createRequire } from "node:module";
    const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);
    require("./script.js");
However, the script has some behavior that isn't handled well including a
dynamic `import()` of an `mjs` module as well as Mathjax which might also do
some non-standard importing? I'm guessing that `deno run` for `npm` scripts
might setup some additional facilities to make more scenarios work properly
than `createRequire` does?
Anyway, if there is a way to do this for local npm executable scripts it would
be fabulous!
