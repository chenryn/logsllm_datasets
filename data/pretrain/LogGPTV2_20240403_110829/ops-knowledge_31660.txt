To effectively implement CIS Control 9.1, which ensures the use of only fully supported browsers and email clients, an organization should follow these main procedures:

1. **Policy Development and Communication:**
   - Develop a clear policy that mandates the use of only fully supported and up-to-date browsers and email clients.
   - Communicate this policy to all employees and stakeholders, ensuring they understand the importance of using approved software.

2. **Inventory and Assessment:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive inventory of all browsers and email clients currently in use within the organization.
   - Assess the support status of each application, identifying any that are outdated or no longer supported by their vendors.

3. **Standardization and Deployment:**
   - Standardize on a limited set of fully supported and regularly updated browsers and email clients.
   - Deploy these standardized applications across the organization, ensuring that all users have access to the latest versions.

4. **Configuration Management:**
   - Configure the approved browsers and email clients to meet the organization's security requirements.
   - Use group policies or other management tools to enforce these configurations and prevent unauthorized changes.

5. **Monitoring and Enforcement:**
   - Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect the use of unsupported browsers and email clients.
   - Enforce the policy through technical controls, such as blocking access to unsupported applications or preventing them from running.

6. **Regular Updates and Patching:**
   - Ensure that the approved browsers and email clients are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
   - Establish a regular update schedule and automate the process where possible to maintain the highest level of security.

7. **Training and Awareness:**
   - Provide training to employees on the importance of using supported browsers and email clients and the risks associated with unsupported software.
   - Regularly remind users about the policy and the steps they need to take to stay compliant.

By following these procedures, an organization can ensure that only fully supported and secure browsers and email clients are used, thereby reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and enhancing overall security. 

**Note:** CIS Control 9.1 falls under the asset type "Applications" and serves the security function of "Protect."
