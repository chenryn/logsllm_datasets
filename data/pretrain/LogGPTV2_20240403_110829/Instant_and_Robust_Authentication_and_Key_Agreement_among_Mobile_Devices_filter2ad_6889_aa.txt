for device authentication [19][18][11][22][17][12][13]. Those
methods are based on an observation that two devices in
physical proximity can usually obtain some similar physical
information. In the scenario of pairing devices without prior
secure associations, two devices have no prior knowledge of
each other. The major information they can obtain in authen-
tication is the physical proximity. Therefore, those proximity-
based authentication methods are reasonable and necessary
for grouping mobile devices on their ﬁrst acquaintance. For
example, they may use similar radio related information such
as RSSI and CSI [19][18][11][22][17][12], ambient audio and
luminosity [13], and time-varying channels [10][15][21] as a
proof of physical proximity for pairing two devices.
Abstract—Device-to-device (D2D) communication is widely
used for mobile devices and Internet of Things (IoT). Authenti-
cation and key agreement are critical to build a secure channel
between two devices. However, existing approaches often rely on a
pre-built ﬁngerprint database and suffer from low key generation
rate. We present GeneWave, a fast device authentication and key
agreement protocol for commodity mobile devices. GeneWave
ﬁrst achieves bidirectional initial authentication based on the
physical response interval between two devices. To keep the
accuracy of interval estimation, we eliminate time uncertainty on
commodity devices through fast signal detection and redundancy
time cancellation.Then we derive the initial acoustic channel
response (ACR) for device authentication. We design a novel
coding scheme for efﬁcient key agreement while ensuring security.
Therefore, two devices can authenticate each other and securely
agree on a symmetric key. GeneWave requires neither special
hardware nor pre-built ﬁngerprint database, and thus it is easy-
to-use on commercial mobile devices. We implement GeneWave
on mobile devices (i.e., Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P) and evaluate
its performance through extensive experiments. Experimental
results show that GeneWave efﬁciently accomplish secure key
agreement on commodity smartphones with a key generation
rate 10x faster than the state-of-the-art approach.
I. INTRODUCTION
Device-to-device (D2D) communication has been widely
used as the fast development of mobile and Internet of things
(IoTs) technology in recent years. For example, mobile and
IoT devices use D2D communication for ﬁle sharing, mobile
paying, data collection, etc. Despite of its prevalence and
convenience, D2D communication has security vulnerability
issues in practice. It faces attacks such as eavesdropping,
impostor attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks due to the
use of open communication channels [19][5]. For example, it
is common that a wearable device (e.g. smart watch) shares
health data with a mobile device through open channels. Under
an insecure communication channel, private data such as per-
sonal identity information, health conditions, and movement
trajectory is easily leaked.
To support secure D2D communication in open wireless
channels such as Wi-Fi, BlueTooth and ZigBee, device authen-
tication and key agreement should be performed among mobile
devices. Before communication, two devices authenticate each
other and agree on a symmetric key. Then those two devices
can build a secure communication channel by using the
symmetric key to encrypt their data.
Secure device authentication and key agreement among
mobile devices have attracted many efforts. A large portion of
methods use the physical proximity of devices as the feature
978-1-5090-6501-1/17/$31.00 c(cid:13) 2017 IEEE
However, those methods suffer from practical problems.
First, they may rely on dedicated hardware, e.g., CSI based
methods [19][18][11][22][9] use Intel 5300 network card
which is not used on commercial mobile devices at present.
Second, they may not be easy to use in practice. For example,
they may require the antennas of the two devices to be very
close to each other, e.g., 5 cm [19], 1.25 cm [12]. In practice,
it is difﬁcult to achieve especially for embedded antennas
on mobile devices. Third, many methods [12][17][3][14][20],
which obtain symmetric keys from received signal strength,
are vulnerable to predictable channel attacks. Attackers can
intentionally block/unblock the signal to the devices to create
predictable signal patterns. Last but not least, many method-
s [12][17][13] are not efﬁcient since they require a long time
for key agreement.
Moreover, ﬁngerprinting-based methods [8] [2] [16] [4]
[23] [6] leverage hardware properties. [4][23][6] exploit the
frequency response of speakers by sound signal with special
frequency pattern, and use it to generate ﬁngerprint in au-
thentication. [1] and [7] use hardware (e.g., accelerometer) to
generate ﬁngerprint in authentication. Those methods need to
learn the ﬁngerprint or share a common ﬁngerprint database
in advance.
To address those problems, we propose GeneWave, a gener-
al device authentication and key agreement method for secure
D2D communication. Instead of using pre-built ﬁngerprint
database, two devices in physical proximity authenticate each
other by the bounded acoustic round-trip traveling time. Ge-
neWave achieves authentication and key agreement by the
following two major steps: bidirectional initial authentication
and key agreement. During authentication, we derive unique
features of the acoustic channel, i.e., acoustic channel response
(ACR) from two devices for bidirectional initial authentication.
In key agreement, we propose a sine wave based pulse coding
method to efﬁciently encode the symmetric key on the acoustic
signal. After receiving the acoustic signal, the device can
decode the symmetric key as well as verifying the identity of
the signal source using the ACR. GeneWave does not require
pre-shared ﬁngerprint database.
The practical design of GeneWave faces several challenges.
First, how to efﬁciently distinguish the traveling time differ-
ence for two devices, especially in the presence of uncertainty
of signal detection and dynamic hardware processing delay.
We propose an efﬁcient FFT based fast signal detection
approach for signal detection. Meanwhile, we also design a
time cancellation method to eliminate hardware latency. The
second challenge is how to embed information of secret key in
the acoustic signal. The ACR features may not be accurately
derived from the signal encoded with message. To address
this, we propose a sine wave based pulse coding method
supports both data communication and can effectively extract
channel ACR for authentication. The third challenge is how
to achieve efﬁcient key agreement while ensuring the security
of authentication. Intuitively, there exists a dilemma as more
information encoded in the signal will destroy more ACR
features used by authentication. We optimize the encoding and
decoding scheme to signiﬁcantly improving the coding density
while enhancing the decoding rate.
We implement GeneWave on commercial mobile device
including Nexus 5X and 6P with Android 6.0.1. The imple-
mentation has no special HW/SW requirement and can run on
most Android based mobile devices. The evaluation results
show that the key generation rate is 10x faster than latest
approach [19]. Two devices can ﬁnish authentication and key
agreement for secure communication ﬂexibly (e.g., holding
them in hand, placing them on a table) rather than putting their
antennas very closely. The entire process can be ﬁnished in less
than 2 seconds, which is faster than most existing approaches
and is acceptable in real applications. We believe GeneWave
provides an efﬁcient device authentication and key agreement
approach for many D2D scenarios.
The contributions of this work are as follows.
• We present GeneWave, an efﬁcient and fast authentication
and key agreement method for secure D2D communica-
tion based on acoustic signal.
• We propose a sine wave based pulse coding and op-
timize its performance, which supports efﬁcient data
communication while preserving the channel features for
authentication.
• We implement GeneWave on commercial mobile devices
and verify its effectiveness through extensive evaluations.

II. SYSTEM MODEL AND OBSERVATIONS
In this section, we ﬁrst explain the system and security
model. Then we show the feasibility and challenges of au-
thentication and key agreement between two mobile devices.
A. System and Security Model
Alice and Bob are two legitimate mobile devices, which
need to exchange some private data between each other
through wireless channels. Unfortunately, there is no secure
communication channel for them to exchange data. In order to
protect private data from eavesdropping, they need a common
session key to encrypt data for establishing a secure channel.
To achieve this, Alice and Bob are placed in physical proximity
within a certain safe distance. An attacker Eve is located
beyond a far distance to Alice and Bob. Eve can receive the
acoustic signal from Alice and Bob, and send any acoustic
signal
to perform various attacks including spooﬁng and
eavesdropping. Eve has complete knowledge of our device
authentication and key agreement algorithm. When Eve moves
into the safe distance, Alice and Bob will easily notice it. We
consider the attackers have unlimited capacity and negligible
signal processing delay, but the capacity of legitimate devices
is limited.
Our goal is to instantly make Alice and Bob agree on a
symmetric key for further communication and prevent Eve
from knowing the key. This system guarantees security but
not availability. For example, Eve can play jamming acoustic
signals to prevent Alice and Bob from agreeing on a symmetric
key.
B. ACR based Authentication
In this section, we show the feasibility of using audio
channel for authentication. In the experiments, a mobile device
S1 transmits a chirp acoustic signal in the range [f0, f0 + B]
through its speaker. Another mobile device R1 receives the
signal using the microphone and records the received signal.
We perform frequency domain analysis on the transmitted
and received signal to obtain the time-frequency distribution
and energy distribution. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) show
the time-frequency distribution and energy distribution on
frequency domain of the original chirp signal, respectively.
Figure 1(c) and Figure 1(d) show the time-frequency dis-
tribution and frequency domain distribution of the received
signal, respectively. We can see that the energy distribution
of the received signal is different from the original signal
due to hardware frequency selectivity and multipath effect.
We measure the Acoustic Channel Response(ACR)(i.e., the
energy distribution of the chirp signal) as shown in Figure 1(d).
We have the following observations for the ACR.
1) Device Diversity: We ﬁx the position of sender S, and
use two receivers R1 and R2 to record the acoustic signal from
S at the same position. Figure 2(a) shows the ACR of signal
received by R1 and R2. We compare the ACRs in Figure 2(a).

signal between them can be shorter than any further device.
One of the two legitimate devices (the requester) transmits
acoustic signal (request signal) to the other device (the re-
sponder). The responder response a signal (response signal)
as soon as it detects the request signal from the requester.
We deﬁne the round trip time between the requester and the
responder as response interval of the responder to distinguish
legitimate devices and attackers.
The distance between two legitimate devices (denoted as
legitimate distance) is dl and the distance from an attacker
to those devices (attack distance) is da. In practice we have
da > dl. Otherwise, the attacker is easy to be observed by
users. Assume a legitimate device transmits a signal and a
responder responses with a signal. The response interval can be
c + td(A) + td(B) where td(A) is the processing
calculated as 2dl
delay on the requester A and td(B) is the processing delay on
the responder B, and c is the sound speed. To verify wether
the responder is a legitimate device in physical proximity, we
should have
