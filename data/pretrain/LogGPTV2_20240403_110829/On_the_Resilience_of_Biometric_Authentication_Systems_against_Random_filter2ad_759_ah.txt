APPENDIX A
MITIGATION ROC PLOTS
This appendix contains plots of the results as discussed
in Section VI. Figure 12 contains per-user scatter plots of
AR and FPR for all biometric modalities and algorithms. For
the same classiﬁers, Figure 13 illustrates the ROC curves
for classiﬁers trained with the inclusion of beta distributed
noise only. Finally, Figure 11 displays the ROC curves for
all classiﬁers of touch and face datasets with the inclusion
of both beta distributed noise and raw input vectors as an
additional mitigation strategy against the the raw inputs, which
were unfazed by the beta noise. A summary of changes in
FRR, FPR, AR and RAR of both Figure 13 and 11 have been
provided earlier in Table I and II of Section VI.
APPENDIX B
DNN ESTIMATOR CONFIGURATION.
All models were trained for 5000 steps, with batch size of
50, with the Adagrad optimizer. The exact layer conﬁguration
of the DNNEstimator [47] used can be found on our project
page (https://imathatguy.github.io/Acceptance-Region/).

Individual user scatter of AR and FPR after the addition of beta distributed noise. A substantial proportion of users now exhibit an AR close to zero, or
below the AR = FPR. Unfortunately, this defense mechanism did not completely minimize the AR of LINSVM for the Face authenticator. Nor did this defense
protect two outlying users in the RNDF voice authenticator.
