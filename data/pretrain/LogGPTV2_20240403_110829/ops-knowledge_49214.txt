User: I wonder which option is more stable (leaving performance aside) and is more widely used (I assume the widely used one is the most stable):

apache -> mod_wsgi 
apache -> mod_fcgid
apache -> mod_proxy_ajp 
apache -> mod_proxy_http

for a project that will serve REST services with small json formatted input and output messages and web pages, up to 100 req/s. Please comment on apache if you think nginx etc. is more suitable.
Thanks.
Assistant: apache -> mod-wsgi is currently the "recommended" solution. But it also depends on your needs quite a bit.
There is quite a difference between running 1 heavy application versus 1 light aplication or many light applications.
Personally my preferred setup is still nginx -> apache -> mod_wsgi with multiple apache servers for heavy sites.
