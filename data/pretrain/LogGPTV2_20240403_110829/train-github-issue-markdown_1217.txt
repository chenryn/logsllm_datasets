Here's the command in "Services" under Windows:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre\bin\java.exe
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf\windows-wrapper-logging.properties
-DworkingDir=C:\NEO4J-~1.M05\bin.. -DconfigFile=conf\neo4j-wrapper.conf
-DserverClasspath=lib/ _.jar;system/lib/_.jar;plugins/
_.jar;system/coordinator/lib/_.jar;./conf*
-DserverMainClass=org.neo4j.server.Bootstrapper
-Dorg.neo4j.cluster.logdirectory=C:\NEO4J-~1.M05\bin..\data\log -jar
C:\NEO4J-~1.M05\bin\windows-service-wrapper-*.jar Neo4j-Server
The Neo4J directory is not correct in this command - ~1.M05 - I was trying to
install 1.9.M05. I changed the directory name since I couldn't find a config
file that let me set the directory. Neo4J_Home and Java_Home seem to be okay.
I have a 64-bit OS and both 32-bit and 64-bit java are installed, but I set
Java_Home to the 32-bit version and listed the 32-bit version first in my
Path. The service installs but says it can't start in a timely manner. Any
suggestions?
