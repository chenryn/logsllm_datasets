User: How to Set the IP Address and Subnet Mask for a Specific Network Interface on a Linux System
Assistant: On Linux systems, you can use the ifconfig or ip commands to set the IP address and subnet mask for a specific network interface. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Confirm the name of the network interface to be configured, and you can use the ifconfig command to view all network interfaces. 2. Use the ifconfig command to set the IP address and subnet mask for the network interface: ``` sudo ifconfig <interface_name> <ip_address> netmask <subnet_mask> ``` For example, if you want to set the IP address for the eth0 interface to 192.168.1.10, subnet The netmask is 255.255.255.0, you can execute the following command: ``` sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 ``` 3. Use the ip command to set the IP address and subnet mask for the network interface: ``` sudo ip addr add <ip_address>/<subnet_mask> dev <interface_name> ``` For example, if you want to set the IP address for the eth0 interface to 192.168.1.10 and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0, you can execute the following command: ``` sudo ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0 ``` 4. Verify that the IP address and subnet mask are correctly configured, you can use ifconfig or ip command: ``` ifconfig <interface_name> ip addr show <interface_name> ``` The above is Steps to set the IP address and subnet mask for a specific network interface on a Linux system.
