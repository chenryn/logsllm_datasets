gently oversighting copyright and security checks over the apps.
We believe that our research efforts can positively contribute to
bring user and developer awareness, attract the focus of the re-
search community and regulators, and promote best operational
practices across app store operators.

we could not find any developer policy describing security checks
on apps prior to publication.
Huawei and Lenovo markets show a clearly different behavior.
These stores publish popular apps and present similar app ratings
and download distributions. They also seem to have strict mech-
anisms to prevent malware distribution: only 4.71% and 7.53% of
their apps, respectively were labeled as malware, figures compara-
ble in magnitude to that of Google Play. The purpose of the stores
and their market segment can also influence in the presence of
malware, possibly due to their need to protect their brand reputa-
tion. Lenovo’s MM market does not allow individual developers to
publish apps, a practice that could help them mitigate the spread
of malware and low-quality apps. However, Huawei and Lenovo
markets still have a significant number of outdated apps, which
could hinder users from enjoying newly added features and other
app improvements (e.g., bug fixing). This practice could contribute
to decrease the perceived quality of the apps, hurting as a result
the brand equity of the app store.
9 RELATED WORK
Previous research efforts have performed large-scale mobile app
analysis [35, 45, 47, 50, 55, 85]. However, alternative Android mar-
kets have not been well studied by the research community yet.
To the best of our knowledge, our work is the largest and most
exhaustive comparative analysis made between the official Google
Play store and Chinese alternative markets.
Large-scale App Repositories. AndroZoo [67] is an academic
effort focused on compiling a large-scale dataset of APKs. This
research effort has enabled a number of studies focusing on mali-
cious practices and privacy risks of Android apps [42, 48, 64, 98].
AndroZoo uses purpose-built crawlers to harvest more than 5M
APKs from 12 app stores and 5 Chinese markets with roughly 1.5
Million apps. The work of Ishii et al. [62] is the closest to ours.
They investigated 4.7M Android apps covering 27 app markets,
mainly obtained from AndroZoo [11], to understand the security
management of global third-party markets.
