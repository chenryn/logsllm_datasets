Configuring Multiple Destinations 
It is also possible to configure multiple destinations, after installation of the Forwarding Connector, using the ArcSight SmartConnector Configuration Wizard.To start the wizard, execute the following command:
$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\bin\runagentsetup
You can either modify the existing destination or add a new destination. For this example, adding a second Manager.
1 Select I want to add/remove/modify ArcSight Manager destinations and click Next.

	Chapter 3 	Configuration for HP Operations ManagerHP Operations Manager (HP OM) provides comprehensive event management, proactive performance monitoring, and automated alerting, reporting, and graphing for operating systems, middleware, and applications. It is designed to provide service-driven event and performance management of business-critical enterprise systems, applications, and services. The following topics are described.“The ArcSight Source Manager” on page 29
“Supported Versions of HP OM” on page 30
“Installing the Connector” on page 30
“Creating an SNMP Interceptor (Policy)” on page 34
“Uploading Interceptor Template” on page 35
“Deploying the Policy” on page 35
“Adjusting the Event Processing Rate” on page 36ArcSight ESM sends correlated security events to IT operation teams to investigate and take remediation measures to reduce or eliminate security risks. The ArcSight Forwarding Connector logs into the source Manager, then sends system events and network health information to HP OM from non-SNMP event sources. The ArcSight Forwarding Connector can be used to collect from event sources that support syslog, file, database, API, and other collection methods through ESM.The ArcSight Source Manager
Before installing the Forwarding Connector, create a Forwarding Connector account on the Manager. For detailed instructions on how to do this, see Chapter 1‚ Assigning Privileges on the Source Manager‚ on page 8.

HP OM and Correlation EventsHP OM and Correlation Events
When all rule conditions and thresholds are met, ESM generates an internal event called a correlation event. A correlation event represents the events that contributed to the rule being triggered and the relevant data contained in them.Although most ESM users can use the default settings available for pulling events, HP OM users commonly require only correlated events to be pulled from ESM. In such cases, HP OM users can specify the selection of correlated events. To allow for only correlated events and restrict the pulling of base events, configure ESM to pull correlated events, then allow the forwarding of correlated events, in that order. For detailed instructions to perform these steps, see Chapter 1‚ Forwarding Correlation Events‚ on page 9.HP OM uses a SNPM trap policy to allow ArcSight events to be accepted within the HP OM environment. For instructions on how to create an SNMP interceptor, see “Creating an SNMP Interceptor (Policy)” on page 34.
Installing the Connector
Before you install the connector, make sure that the ArcSight products with which the connectors will communicate have already been installed correctly (such as ArcSight ESM or ArcSight Logger) and that you have assigned the appropriate privileges.1 
2 Download the ArcSight executable for your operating system from the ArcSight Customer Support Site.
Start the ArcSight Installer by running the executable.
Follow the installation wizard through the following folder selection tasks and installation of the core connector software:
