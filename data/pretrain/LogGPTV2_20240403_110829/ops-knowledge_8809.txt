User: I'm in the process of migrating my Google AppEngine solution from Python 2.5 to 2.7. The application migration was relatively easy, but I'm struggling with the unittests.
In the 2.5 version I was using the use_library function to set the django version to 1.2, but this isn't supported anymore on 2.7. Now I set the default version in the app.yaml. 
When I'm now running my unittests the default django version becomes 0.96 and I can't manage to set the 1.2 as the default version. 
Who knows how I can set the default libraries for the unittest, so the match the settings in the app.yaml?
Assistant: app.yaml configuration is not applied when doing unit tests with webtest app and NoseGAE.
use_library does not work neither.
The right solution for this case is to provide proper python path to the preferred lib version, e.g. PYTHONPATH=../google_appengine/lib/django-1.5 when running nosetests.
