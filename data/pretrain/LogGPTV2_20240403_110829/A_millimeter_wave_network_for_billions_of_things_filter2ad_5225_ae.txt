## Performance and Application Suitability

### mmX vs. Existing mmWave Platforms
- **Throughput**: Existing mmWave platforms can provide multiple Gbps throughput, making them suitable for applications requiring high data rates. In contrast, mmX targets applications that require less than 100 Mbps throughput.
- **Energy and Cost**: Existing mmWave platforms are more power-hungry and expensive, while mmX is designed to be low-power and low-cost.

### mmX vs. WiFi and Bluetooth
- **Spectrum Utilization**: mmX operates in the mmWave spectrum (24 GHz), which reduces the strain on the heavily used 2.4 GHz WiFi spectrum.
- **Power Consumption and Bitrate**: The power consumption and bitrate of mmX are comparable to those of ideal WiFi networks. However, real-world WiFi networks often perform poorly due to spectrum overload.
- **Cost**: While the current mmX prototype is more expensive than existing WiFi modules, mass production can significantly reduce costs.
- **Bitrate**: mmX provides up to 100 Mbps, which is much higher than the 1 Mbps offered by Bluetooth, making it more suitable for many IoT applications.

## Conclusion
This paper introduces mmX, a low-power, low-cost mmWave network designed for IoT devices. mmX overcomes the fundamental challenges that prevent existing mmWave systems from being used in low-power, low-cost IoT devices. Key features include:
- **Low-Power Hardware Platform**: The first mmWave low-power hardware platform that operates as a daughterboard for Raspberry Pi.
- **OTAM (Over-the-Air Modulation)**: A novel technique that eliminates the need for costly phased arrays and beam searching, making mmWave communication more accessible and cost-effective.
- **Versatile Applications**: mmX can be used in various applications, such as smart homes and autonomous cars, without placing additional strain on the 2.4 GHz WiFi spectrum.
