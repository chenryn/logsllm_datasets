Table 1: Comparison of mmX with existing mmWave platforms and other wireless systems
provide Gbps throughput while mmX provides 100 Mbps. Therefore,
existing mmWave platforms are suitable for applications which
require multiple Gbps throughput, while having substantial energy
and computing power. In contrast, mmX targets applications that
require less than 100 Mbps throughput while they are low power
and low cost.
Comparison with WiFi and Bluetooth: The main advantage
of mmX compared to WiFi (ex. 802.11n) is that it utilizes mmWave
spectrum (24 GHz) rather than WiFi spectrum (2.4 GHz). Utilizing
mmWave spectrum will remove a huge strain from today’s WiFi
spectrum. Furthermore, as shown in Table 1, the power consump-
tion and bitrate of mmX is in the same range as WiFi. Note that the
reported WiFi performance is for an ideal scenario. In fact, most of
today’s WiFi networks have much lower performance since their
spectrum is overloaded. Therefore, mmX provides similar perfor-
mance to ideal WiFi network while utilizing mmWave spectrum.
Although, current mmX prototype costs more than existing WiFi
modules, the cost can be significantly reduced in mass production.
In comparison with Bluetooth, mmX provides much higher bi-
trate. Specifically, Bluetooth provides only 1Mbps which is not
sufficient for many IoT applications. On the other hand, mmX pro-
vides up to 100 Mbps.
11 CONCLUSION
This paper introduces mmX, a low-power, low-cost mmWave net-
work for IoT devices. In particular, mmX overcomes fundamen-
tal challenges that prevent existing mmWave systems from being
used in low-power, low-cost IoT devices. mmX introduces the first
mmWave low-power hardware platform which operates as a daugh-
terboard for RasberryPi. We believe that this platform helps advance
mmWave research in the IoT domain. In addition, mmX introduces
OTAM, a novel technique to modulate the signal over the air. OTAM
eliminates the need for costly phased array and beam searching
techniques, making adaptation of mmWave communication easier
and less costly. Finally, mmX can be used in many applications (e.g.,
smart home, autonomous cars, etc.) to connect sensors to an access
point without placing any strain on today’s WiFi spectrum.
