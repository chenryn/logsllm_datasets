User: What are the commonly used data structures of Redis? Please describe their purpose respectively.
Assistant: Redis commonly used data structures are string (String), hash table (Hash), list (List), set (Set) and ordered set (ZSet). 1. String (String): used to store strings, numbers and binary data, strings can be set, modified and read. It is often used in scenarios such as caching, counting, and distributed locks. 2. Hash table (Hash): Stores data in a form similar to key-value pairs. It can store multiple fields and values. It is often used to store complex data types such as objects and user information. 3. List (List): Similar to an array, elements can be added at the head or tail, and elements can be inserted or deleted at a specified position. It is often used for sequential data collections, such as message queues, recent access, etc. 4. Set (Set): used to store unordered and non-repeated elements, supports operations such as intersection, union, and difference, and is often used to deduplicate data and quickly determine whether an element exists. 5. Ordered set (ZSet): similar to a set, but each element has a weight (score), which can be sorted according to the weight. It is often used for item ranking, leaderboard and other needs.
