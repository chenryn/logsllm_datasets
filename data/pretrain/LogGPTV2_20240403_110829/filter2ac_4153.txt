**ATT&CK ID:** T0807  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Command-Line Interface

Adversaries may leverage command-line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with systems and execute commands. CLIs are a standard feature in many types of platforms and devices, including those found in control system environments. These interfaces enable direct interaction with the underlying operating system, allowing for the execution of a wide range of tasks.

In addition to performing legitimate system management and administrative functions, adversaries can use CLIs to install and run new software, including malicious tools. Such tools may be deployed during various stages of an operation to achieve specific objectives, such as data exfiltration, persistence, or further system compromise.
