An  elementary  SAN  consists  of:  i)  two  places  (CCi, 
SMi),  ii)  two  input  gates  (fi,  IGi),  iii)  two  output  gates 
(OGi, fmi), and iv) two timed activities (Li, maneuver). 
This  model  is  replicated  2n  times  (i.e.,  one  model  for 
each vehicle).  
Places CCi  are local to each sub model. Each place 
CCi  will  have  one  token  when  a  vehicle  enters  the 
platoon (i.e., place IN is marked). Place int_id saves the 
ID of each vehicle in the system. Place start_id is used 
for the initialization of the submodel.  
In  the  following,  we  present  an  overview  of  the 
whole  system  model,  and  then  we  describe  the 
submodels composing the whole model.  
3.1. Overview of the system model  
Figure  4  shows  the  overall  structure  of  the  model 
describing the AHS composed of two lanes. The model 
includes 2n replicas of the One_vehicle sub model that 
are

submodels: 
Configuration, Dynamicity, and Severity. 
composed  with 
three 
The  One_vehicle  submodel  describes  the  behavior 
of a vehicle as resulting from its failure modes and the 
maneuvers  presented 
in  Table  1.  The  Severity 
submodel  describes  the  impact  of  multiple  failures 
affecting several vehicles. The sub model Dynamicity is 
used  to  model  the  dynamics  of  the  system  in  the 
absence  of  failures,  resulting  from  join  and  leave 
events  that  correspond  to  vehicles  entering  or  getting 
out  of  the  highway.  The  Configuration  submodel 
initializes  the  other  submodels  and  synchronizes  their 
evolution according to the whole system evolution. 
In the following, we detail each submodel.

Figure 5: One_vehicle SAN model   
Place CCi  identifies the initial state from which the 
failure mode described by timed activity Li  with firing 
rate 
i  could  be  fired.  The  occurrence  of  the  failure 
mode  activates  the  associated  maneuver  (place  SMi  is 
marked).  The  selection  of  the  appropriate  maneuver 
(TIE-N,  TIE,  TIE-E,  CS,  GS,  or  AS)  depends  on  its 
priority  compared  to  other  maneuvers  that  might  be 
already active, and on the state of the adjacent vehicles 
contributing  to  the  maneuver.  The  predicates  and  the 
functions  associated  with  the  input  gates  IGi  and  the 
output  gates  fmi  manage  the  priority  of  maneuvers  as 
defined in Table 1 and check the marking of places SMi 
of the adjacent vehicles, according to the coordination 
strategy  presented  in  Table  3.  When  a  higher  priority 
maneuver  is  activated,  all  lower  priority  maneuvers 
associated  with  the  same  vehicles  are  inhibited.  The 
execution  times  of  the  maneuvers  are  described  by 
exponentially  distributed  timed  activities  with  firing 
rates ( TIE-N,  TIE,  TIE-E,  CS,  GS, and  AS). 
If the maneuver succeeds, place v_OK  is marked to 
indicate that the vehicle gets out of the highway safely. 
The maneuver failure leads the vehicle to start the next 
higher  priority  maneuver,  as  explained  in  Section  2.1. 
Eventually, if the maneuver in highest priority AS fails, 
v_KO  is marked, and the vehicle becomes a free agent 
(this  is  not  represented  in  the  model  because  it  will 
constitute  a  third  platoon).  The  two  existing  platoons 
continue their way without this vehicle. 
When a vehicle gets out of the platoon by reaching 
one of the places v_OK or v_KO, another vehicle could 
join  the  system.  This  is  modeled  through  the  timed 
activity  back_to  and  the  marking  of  place  OUT  (see 
also Figure 7).  
3.2.2.  Severity:  This  submodel  presented  in  Figure  6 
describes  the  combination  of  failure  modes  affecting 
multiple vehicles that lead the system to an unsafe sate. 
Each time a failure mode Li  is fired in an One_vehicle 
submodel,  the  marking  of  the  place  indicating  the 
corresponding  severity  class  is  incremented  (class_A, 
class_B,  class_C).  These  extended  places  are  shared 
by  all  the  submodels.  Each  of  them  is  modeled  as  an 
array  listing  the  ongoing  maneuvers  with  the  number 
of  failure  modes  of  the  corresponding  severity  class 
that are active during the execution of the maneuver. 
The  predicates  and  functions  associated  with  the 
input gate KO_allocation and the output gate OG_KO in 
Figure  6  describe  the  impact  on  the  global  safety  of 
multiple 
several  vehicles,  as 
presented  in  Table  2.  When  the  instantaneous  activity 
to_KO  is  fired,  the  place  KO_total  becomes  marked 
indicating that the system has reached an unsafe state.   
failures  affecting 
There are five timed activities (leave1, leave2, ch1, 
ch2, and Join). The three activities (leave1, leave2, and 
Join)  implement  the  voluntary  join  and  leave  of 
vehicles  (i.e.,  in  absence  of  failures).  The  other  two 
activities  (ch1  and  ch2)  model  the  time  spent  by  a 
vehicle  for  splitting  from  a  platoon  and  joining  the 
other one. 
Figure 7: Dynamicity SAN model  
When a vehicle leaves a platoon, the OUT place will 
be  marked,  thus  another  vehicle  could  join  the 
highway. All other input and output gates are used for 
managing  the  vehicles  positions  after  each  leave  and 
join  event.  In  addition,  each  time  a  vehicle  joins  a 
platoon; it occupies the last position of the platoon.   
3.2.4.  Configuration:  This  submodel,  presented  in 
Figure  8,  is  used  to  define  the  initial  configuration  of 
the  platoons  and 
the  One_vehicle 
submodels associated with each vehicle included in the 
platoons.  Each  platoon  can  contain  up  to  n  vehicles. 
Thus  the  system  model  is  composed  of  2n  replicas  of 
the One_vehicle submodel.

3.2.3.  Dynamicity:  The  SAN  submodel  is  given  in 
Figure 7. There are four places (IN, platoon1, platoon2, 
and  OUT).  The  two  places  platoon1  and  platoon2  are 
shared  between  all  submodels.  They  are  extended 
places represented as an array of length n, each of them 
modeling  one  platoon.  All  these  places  have  initially 
zero token.  
When IN is marked, the instantaneous activity JP is 
fired  indicating  that  a  vehicle  has  joined  a  platoon. 
Two  cases  are  associated  with 
this  activity 
corresponding to the selection of platoon1 or platoon2, 
each with probability 50%.  
Figure 8: Configuration SAN model  
The  Configuration  submodel  contains  four  places; 
all  of  them  have  initially  zero  token  except  start_id 
which  has  one  token.  Places  (start_id,  int_id,  and  IN) 
are  shared  with 
the  corresponding  One_vehicle 
submodel replicas included in the configuration of the 
AHS.  Initially  2n  replicas  are  created,  n  vehicles  for 
each platoon. The place ext_id is a global place shared 
by  all  sub  models,  to  act  as  a  counter.  Each  time  the 
instantaneous activity id_trigger is fired, a new vehicle 
is  included  in  the  system  and  assigned  a  vehicle_id. 
Also place IN is marked to initialize: i) the One_vehicle 
submodel  associated  with  this  vehicle,  and  ii)  the 
Dynamicity  submodel  that  will  associate  the  vehicle to 
a  given  platoon.  The  ID  assigned  to  the  vehicle  is 
stored in the place int_id. When a new vehicle joins the 
system, int_id  gets the value stored in ext_id, which in 
turn is incremented by one.

shown  in  the  Dynamicity  submodel  of  Figure  7).  We 
consider the same numerical values for the two change 
rates equal to 6/hr. 
The  numerical  values  used  are  inspired  from  real

easily modified. 
Each  vehicle  in  platoon2  leaving  the  highway

4.2. Failure rate and number of vehicles impact  
We  illustrate  the  type  of  results  obtained  from  the 
processing  of  the  SAN  model  presented  in  Section  3, 
and  show  sensitivity  analyses  with  respect  to  various 
parameters impacting the AHS safety. 
The  unsafety  measure  S (t)  defined  in  Section  3, 
corresponds  to  the  probability  to  have  a  token  in  the 
place  KO_total  of  Figure  6.  The  analyses  focus  on the 
impact on  S (t)  of the failure rates associated with the 
failure  modes,  the  maximum  number  of  vehicles  per 
platoon,  the  trip  duration,  and  the  AHS  coordination 
strategies.   
4.1. Assumptions and values of the parameters  
We  assume  that  all  the  processes  represented  by 
timed  activities  in  the  SAN  models  have  exponential 
distributions (i.e., have constant occurrence rates).  
Let 
be  the  smallest  failure  rate.  To  facilitate 
sensitivity  analyses,  the  values  of  the  failure  rates 
i 
associated with the six failure modes FMi identified in 
Table  1  are  expressed  in  terms  of 
.  In  this  paper, 
considering  the  contribution  of  all  sources  of  failures 
that  can  lead  to  the  considered  failure  mode,  we  have 
used the following values: 
6= 4 ;  5=3 ;  4=2 ;  3=2 ;  2=2  ;  1=  .
The  values  of  execution  rates  associated  with  the 
maneuvers ( TIE-N,  TIE,  TIE-E,  CS,  GS,  AS) range from 
15/hr  and  30/hr  (maneuver  durations  between  4  and  2 
minutes).  
We  suppose  that  the  two  highway  lanes  start 
initially with n vehicles  in each platoon (platoon1  and 
platoon2).  At  any  time  each  vehicle  can  change  from 
We  first  show  in  Figure  10  the  impact  of  n,  the 
maximum number of vehicles per platoon on  S (t) , for 
trip durations varying from 2 to 10 hours.  
Figure 10:  S (t)  versus time for different n 
=10-5/hr, join rate=12/hr and leave rate = 4/hr  
This figure shows that:  
- For a given value n, the probability of reaching the 
unsafe  state  increases  by  one  order  of  magnitude 
when  the  trip  duration  increases  from  2  to  10 
hours.  
- For  a  given  trip  duration,  increasing  n  leads  to  a 
significant increase of  S (t) . For example, when n 
is increased from 8 to 12, the unsafety is one order 
of magnitude higher, for a 10 hours trip duration. 
For  a  failure  rate  equal  to  10-5/hr,  the  level  of 
unsafety  remains  low  when  n  is  less  than  10.  Higher 
values  of  n  lead  to  a  more  degraded  safety  especially 
when considering long trip durations.  
The  impact  of  the  failure  rate  is  illustrated  in  
Figure  11  considering  three  values  for 
.  We  notice 
that the probability of reaching an unsafe state is very 
sensitive  to  the  value  of  the  failure  rate.  For  example, 
increasing the failure rate from 10-6/hr to 10-5/hr, leads 
to an increase of unsafety of about 175 times, for a trip 
duration of 6 hours. The variation of system unsafety is 
lower (about 40 times) when increasing the failure rate 
from  10-5/hr  to  10-4/hr  for  the  same  trip  duration. 
Additionally,  it  can  be  noticed  that  the  sensitivity  of 
S (t)  to  the  trip  duration  is  higher  for  lower  values  of 
.  For   =10-6/hr  the  steady  state  is 
the  failure  rate 
reached very quickly.  
When  the  failure  rate  is  10-7/hr,  the  unsafety  is 
about 10-13. This is why the corresponding curve is not 
plotted.  Similarly,  for  a  2 hours  trip  duration,  the 
unsafety is almost 10-12/hr for   =10-6/hr.
