User: Please provide a Python script for testing the API performance of the web application.
Assistant: Following is a simple Python script to test the API performance of a web application. This script uses the requests module to send HTTP requests to the API and logs the response time and number of requests. ```python import requests import time url = 'http://example.com/api' # Replace with your API address num_requests = 100 # Replace with the number of times you want to send requests total_time = 0 for i in range(num_requests) : start_time = time.time() response = requests.get(url) end_time = time.time() request_time = end_time - start_time total_time += request_time print(f'Response time: {request_time:.2f} seconds') average_time = total_time / num_requests requests_per_second = num_requests / total_time print(f'Average response time: {average_time:.2f} seconds') print(f'Requests per second: {requests_per_second:.2f}') ``` run this script, the output will be Includes response time per request, average response time, and requests per second. You can modify the number of requests and API address as needed.
