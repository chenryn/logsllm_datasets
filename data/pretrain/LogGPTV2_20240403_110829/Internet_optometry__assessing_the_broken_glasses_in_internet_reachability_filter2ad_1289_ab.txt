ﬂap damping. We then announce the (poisoned) preﬁx, and wait
for 20 minutes to allow it to propagate. We then start testing the
poisoned AS using pings from the test-address space to our set of
target IP addresses in the relevant AS. The time necessary to probe
varies, as we have to wait for the ping timeouts and to probe some
IP addresses several times to compensate for packet loss. A typical
test run took between 2 and 3 hours, but remember that we could
conduct a series of such tests in parallel to allow for wide coverage.
We also compared test probes of the target IP addresses from
unpoisoned address space to check that these addresses were con-
sistently available over the course of the whole experiment. As one
might expect, the vast majority (99.2%) were consistent.
3.1 Results
Did IP addresses respond when their AS path was poisoned?
In 64% of cases the answer was “Yes”. Perhaps more interesting
though are the results per AS (we tested multiple IP addresses per
AS, and the distribution of the number per AS varied).
We found that 74.8% of ASes (19,291) answered consistently
despite the poisoning. The interpretation is that the majority of
ASes have a default route.
Of the remaining ASes 20.9% (5,381) never answered, and 4.3%
(1, 108) answered for some IP addresses, but not others (e.g., mixed
results). We noticed in the look-ahead that some probes to the test
address space failed (e.g., due to “bogon-ﬁlters”), but this was a
very small percentage, 0.7%. We interpret a non-response as the
AS being default-free, though this interpretation is less certain as
we cannot say that no IP address in the AS ever uses default.
The mixed result category is interesting and reveals the com-
plexity of network management practice. For example, we have
received one explicit conﬁrmation from an operator who explained
that some routers are conﬁgured to use default-free BGP routing,
while others rely on static default routes. He explained that this was
because of the IP-TV, and VoIP services. This illustrates that ASes
do not have to be homogeneously conﬁgured, and we certainly see
this clearly in our results.
One more cautionary note: The usage of default-routing varies
also between cultures. We have heard from another operator, who
checked all Japanese ISPs using our data and discovered that 60%
of all ASes in Japan are default-free, and only 36% used default
(4% were mixed).
To evaluate our methodology we setup a website, where we asked
operators to verify our ﬁndings. Overall, we received 191 responses
from the operational community. 158 operators (82.7%) said our
inference was correct. 12 operators (6.3%) said that our measure-
ment was correct as far as it went, but incomplete. If we had tested
additional addresses we would have seen mixed behaviour. This
shows that even more ASes than we suspected are heterogenously
conﬁgured. The lesson for us is that we will have to go to a ﬁner
granularity for improved measurements, but that the overall prob-
ing methodology works. 9 operators (4.7%) said they believed we
are right, but were not sure and did not recheck. In summary, about
94% of operators validated the results of our methodology.
However, 7 operators (3.7%) said our inference was wrong. Un-
244fortunately, not all gave us feedback why they believed we were
wrong, but the most common reason given was that we probed an
IP address from their block, but which they had delegated to a dif-
ferent AS. Thus our inference of their use of defaults should have
been attributed to a different administrative domain.
Finally, 5 operators (2.6%) operators classiﬁed themselves as
clueless, but still believed our methodology must be wrong. We
received feedback such as “I’m not quite sure what you mean by
’default’?”, leading one to suspect these responses were not useful
in validation.
Surprisingly, we received many responses from operators who
were not actually aware of having a default-route in their network
(prior to ﬁlling in our survey). For example, some received a default-
route announcement from their upstream provider, which they were
not ﬁltering.
3.2 The Impact of AS Type
Intuitively, we might expect that ASes that provide transit to
other networks will be less likely to use default routes than “stub”
ASes. We test this by breaking down our previous results by AS
type. However, the naive classiﬁcation of ASes into transit/stubs
by labelling any AS that appears in the middle of an AS path a tran-
sit provider and ASes that only originate preﬁxes a stub, does not
take into account the business relationships between ASes. Hence
we use the classiﬁcation provided by UCLA [5, 6], which takes
into account longer time periods and additional inference such as
customer-provider relationships and node-out-degree to classify the
ASes into three classes: stub, small ISP, and large ISP. We use their
data from just before our experiment (from April 11, 2009). Our
experiment covered 24,224 (76.9%) of the 31, 517 stub ASes in
the UCLA data; 1,307 (96.0%) of the 1,361 small ISPs; and 246
(96.5%) of the 255 large ISPs. The UCLA data also contains 8 tier-
1 ASes, but our upstream provider uses AS path ﬁltering for paths
that contain another tier-1. Therefore, we could not test any tier-1
AS.
Table 3 provides the breakdown of our results according to the
UCLA classiﬁcation. The ﬁrst row of Table 3 gives results for stub
ASes: 77.1% have default, 19.3% are default-free, the remaining
3.6% are mixed (including bogons and potential measurement er-
rors). Small ISPs (second row) appear to use default in 44.5% of
the cases, 42.2% appear to be default-free, the remaining 13.3% are
mixed. In the large ISP category (third row): 17.1% of large ISPs
appear to have default, 60.6% appear to be default-free, and 22.3%
are mixed. Overall, two trends are noticeable:
1. When going from stubs to large ISPs, the fraction of defaults
decreases and the fraction of default-free ISPs increases.
2. The number of ASes with mixed results also increases from
stub to larger ISPs. This suggests that larger ISPs have differ-
ent policies and conﬁguration associated with their preﬁxes.
Another factor to keep in mind is that in larger ISPs we typi-
cally have more preﬁxes and measurement points, so that the
apparent increasing complexity in their use of default routing
could be an artifact of the measurement sampling.
The use of default routing is very popular in stub ASes, but less
in transit providers, and even less in large transit providers. This
is also illustrated by Figure 42, which shows a breakdown of our
results (default, default-free, or mixed) against the AS out-degree.
We see a trend towards decreasing use of default, and increasingly
mixed policies as the out-degree increases (at least up to degree

degree larger than 300 were put in the 300 bin.

100). About 80% of ASes with out-degree at most 20 rely on de-
fault routing. ASes that have high out-degree (300 or more) use
default routing in less than 15% of the cases.
The uneven popularity of default routing in different types of
ASes is not entirely unexpected, but does complicate the relation-
ship between the data and control planes. For example, if one is
initiating a traceroute from a stub network towards some target IP
address for which routers on the data path do not have a speciﬁc
entry, it is possible that the traceroute manages to reach the tran-
sit part of the Internet, but stops there. The person initiating the
traceroute may then wonder whether there is some problem at the
location where the traceroute stops. There is, however, nothing
particularly wrong with this location. It is the reachability until the
point where the traceroute stops that should be considered surpris-
ing from a control-plane viewpoint, since the ISPs in question had
no knowledge of the target, and were just using default routing to
get to that point. This may cause confusion about the source of a
routing problem, and certainly suggests that neither data-plane, nor
control-plane measurements are adequate by themselves.
3.3 The Impact of Defaults
The obvious question to ask at this point is “Do defaults matter?”
Clearly they matter to the network operators (otherwise why use
them so consistently), but how do they impact our measurements?
We provide some intuition into this question through simple simu-
lations.
In our simulations, we once again use the AS topology and rela-
tionship data provided by UCLA [5]. We could also use our classi-
ﬁcation of which ASes have default, but this would limit our abil-
ity to perform a large number of simulations, and so we use the
given topology, but randomly assign which ASes use default, using
the probabilities given in Figure 3 (to be conservative, we exclude
the mixed cases, and assign default with probability 0.771, 0.445
and 0.171 for stubs, small and large ISPs respectively). For each
245AS using default, we also need to choose where its default route
points. Our measurements do not at present tell us which provider
is being used as the default, and so we test two schemes for choos-
ing defaults: random, and max. In the random allocation scheme
we choose randomly from an AS’s providers. In the max alloca-
tion scheme we choose the provider with the maximum number
of customers (i.e., using this measure as a proxy for the size of
the provider, we choose the largest provider as the default). These
schemes may not be used in practice, but the contrast between them
is illuminating.
For each simulated topology we choose a random set of 1000
sources. For each source, we then consider how many potential
destination ASes can be reached from this source using default
routes. If we use only defaults, then we can reach very few ASes.
The Internet hierarchy is relatively ﬂat, so even from a small stub
AS, we need only go up through a few layers of providers before
we reach a large, or tier-1 provider which should not use default.
We found that typically only 1 to 3 ASes could be reached in this
way, and that the maximum was 5.
tion of the Internet. In particular, the propagation of our /25 preﬁx
does not follow a simple “hop-count” mechanism, but is spread de-
pending on the local ﬁlters at each AS. However, the simulations
do provide us with some valuable intuition. It is quite possible that
once the /25 reaches our provider, and perhaps a few other ASes
that it will be reachable from a signiﬁcant proportion of the Inter-
net, despite the limited propagation of its routing announcements.
We believe that the experiment of this section also sheds much
light on the counter-intuitive results of [3]. The authors of [3] found
that the correlation between data-plane and control-plane observa-
tions were sometimes surprising, e.g., packets still reached their
destination despite the control plane indicating that the correspond-
ing preﬁx is not reachable. Default routing provides a simple ex-
planation for the phenomena of reachability without visibility.
This property of reachability without visibility has not been
allowed for in most research on the Internet’s topology and
routing. Yet it is clear that it provides an unanticipated level
of resilience in the Internet’s routing architecture, not just at
the local ISP level.
4. HIDDEN UPSTREAM DISCOVERY
1−hop, max
2−hop, max
1−hop, random
AS topologies derived from BGP monitors are known to miss
some links [1]. The limited view of BGP monitors leads to miss-
ing data, but more importantly there is some evidence that we see
most of the customer-provider links, but miss a signiﬁcant propor-
tion of the peer-to-peer links [7]. This type of measurement bias (if
present) is important for topology generation, economic modelling
and answering what-if questions. In this section we extend the pre-
vious results to test the hypothesis that the customer-provider links
are relatively easy to ﬁnd.
AS-path poisoning was used in the previous section to poison an
announcement so that a single AS cannot see it. In this experiment
we poison the announcement to all known upstream providers of
an AS. If there is a hidden or unobserved upstream, it will provide
an alternative route that will allow connectivity despite our efforts.
Once again we use the AS-topology data from UCLA [5,6]. This
data set uses static BGP snapshots as well as observation from BGP
dynamics to determine interconnections between ASes and is there-
fore considered to be one of the most complete AS-topologies to-
day. In addition, it contains inferred relationships between the ASes
from which we may derive a set of upstream providers for each AS.
We need to be able to discriminate between hidden upstreams,
and default routes, and so our set of tested ASes must be restricted.
ASes whose known upstream providers use defaults (or have mixed
behavior) are unsuitable. In these cases, poisoning upstreams will
not necessarily prevent connectivity. We found 966 suitable ASes
whose neighbors in the UCLA data do not possess a default route
(according to our previous measurements).
We do not need to test each of these ASes separately. For in-
stance, assume AS x has neighboring ASes a, b and c, and AS y
has neighboring ASes a and b. If we poison a, b and c we can si-
multaneously test both AS x and y for hidden upstream providers.
Using this method, we reduced the number of required tests to 406.
Of the 966 tested ASes, 912 were not reachable after poisoning
their adjacent ASes, implying that they do not have additional up-
stream providers. Only 33 ASes were still reachable after upstream
poisoning, while 5 gave inconsistent results and 16 were suffering
from bogon ﬁlters (see Section 5.2). So at most 4% of the tested
ASes may have upstream provider links that are missing from our
sample of the AS topology.
Even these few missing links are in doubt. There are potentially
some errors in mapping of IP addresses to AS numbers, so if an IP
address was not within the suggested AS x, our attempt to poison

The more interesting case occurs when we consider an experi-
ment such as our /25 advertisement. In this case, the advertisement
is accepted by our provider. If we allow that such advertisements
will be accepted by immediate providers (but not anyone else), and
then consider how many ASes can be reached, we get a distribution
of number of ASes as shown in Figure 5 (solid curve). The ﬁg-
