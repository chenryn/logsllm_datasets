User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Unable to SSH into EC2 instance I've read through the existing answers to this topic, but I still can't seem to connect. I've created an AWS key and saved to my ~/.ssh folder. 

The command:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/jdrake.pem ec2-user@ec2-75-101-217-120.compute-1.amazonaws.com -v


results in:

OpenSSH_5.2p1, OpenSSL 0.9.8r 8 Feb 2011

I've also tried different users (ubuntu, root, jdrake) without success. I am on OSX.

Assistant: From the logs above you are connecting to an Ubuntu machine:

   debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.3p1 Debian-3ubuntu7


Therefore the default username for that box will be ubuntu, not ec2-user which is only for Amazon Linux.
