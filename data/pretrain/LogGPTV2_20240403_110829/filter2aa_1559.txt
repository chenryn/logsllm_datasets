You may have noticed that the Connection header itself is listed above as a default hop-by-hop header. This would 
suggest a compliant proxy should not be forwarding a request's list of custom hop-by-hop headers to the next server 
in the chain in its Connection header when it forwards the request - that is, a compliant proxy should consume the 
requests' Connection header entirely. However, my research suggests this may not always be occurring as expected - 
some systems appear to either also forward the entire Connection header, or copy the hop-by-hop list and append it 
to its own Connection header. For example, HAProxy appears to pass the Connection header through untouched, as does 
Nginx when acting as a proxy.
