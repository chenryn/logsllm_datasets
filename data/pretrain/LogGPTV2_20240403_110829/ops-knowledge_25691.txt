User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SSH "connection refused" diagnostics? I'm getting a constant "connection refused" while trying to connect over SSH from OS X to a CentOS VPS with a WHM control panel. SSH is enabled in WHM, and I've generated SSH keys. I also tried SSH with the firewall off for a minute , but no luck.

After perusing other questions, I've run ssh -vv root@xx.xxx.xx.xx and that gives me:

debug2: ssh_connect: needpriv 0
debug1: connect to address xx.xxx.xx.xx port 22: Connection refused


and running  nc -zvw 2 xx.xxx.xx.xx 22 gives me 

nc: connect to xx.xxx.xx.xx port 22 (tcp) failed: Connection refused


What do these really mean? What else can I try?

Assistant: The port appears to be closed (or filtered, but you say you've already tried disabling the firewall - you mean the one on the VPS, right?).

Can you please post the output of this command on the VPS if you have access by other means?

netstat -ntlp


It should list all open ports. Check port 22 is up on the right IP if you have several.

Do you have outgoing traffic firewall rules on the OSX client?

Edit: I took the liberty of running a port scan against that host and it doesn't seem to have a firewall up anyway, as many ports are open (you should probably close some or most when you can). SSH doesn't seem to be up though:

Try /etc/init.d/sshd restart and check /var/log/messages for errors.
