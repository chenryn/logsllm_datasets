Question: An organization has identified a potential vulnerability to forced authentication attacks via SMB and WebDAV protocols. As a security consultant, you are tasked with recommending mitigation strategies. Which combination of strategies would provide effective protection while minimizing impact on legitimate network use?
"A": "Block all SMB and WebDAV traffic both within and exiting the network and require two-factor authentication for all users.",
"B": "Filter or block WebDAV protocol traffic from exiting the network and use strong passwords to increase the difficulty of cracking obtained credential hashes.",
"C": "Restrict SMB and WebDAV traffic to allowlisted external systems only and implement strict account lockout policies after two failed authentication attempts.",
"D": "Eliminate the use of SMB and WebDAV protocols entirely and transition to a proprietary protocol for internal and external resource sharing."
Answer: B
