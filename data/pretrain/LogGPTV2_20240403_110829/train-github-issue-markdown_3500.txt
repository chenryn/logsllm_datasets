### Proposed changes
Inspired by the example stem plot.
**1\. Z order**
Currently the stems are on top of the markers. This is in agreement with the
MATLAB behavior http://de.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/stem.html#btrw_xi-94
However, it looks a bit untidy. I propose to place the markers on top.
**2\. Example coloring**
The example cycles through the stem colors. IMO this is an untypical use case.
The example (in particular if we just have one) should show a typical diagram.
Therefore, we should change it to just one stem color.
