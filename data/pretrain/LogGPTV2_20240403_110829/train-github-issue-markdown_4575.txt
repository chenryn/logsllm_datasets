I'm new for Atom so I don't have a clue how to fix this.
On Windows, I copy some text that have a trailing carriage return from other
application, such as excel, notepad, then try to search the opening doc in
Atom. Then I was surprising that there's no match. Because you cannot see the
trailing carriage return in any form on the editor, you may not aware the fact
that you are actually searching a 2-lines text.
The search input box seems to be a single-line one, so I guess we may need to
trim CRs and LFs there.
