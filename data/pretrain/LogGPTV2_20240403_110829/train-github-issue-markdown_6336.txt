### Version
2.6.10
### Reproduction link
https://codepen.io/xiangyuecn/pen/eYmmPNP
### Steps to reproduce
  1. Look at the test code running interface. `OnceMsg` area should have been static, but it is not!
  2. Look at the `Test 3` part of the test code. It's exactly the same as the `Test 2` part, but their performance is not the same.
  3. Similar to this kind of code, they are the same, but the results are different:
    	[{{ getTime() }}] {{ name }}
    	[{{ getTime() }}] {{ name }}
    		[{{ getTime() }}] {{ obj.msg }}
    		[{{ getTime() }}] {{ obj.msg }}
> _Use`` because I don't want to use more than one `span`,
> which will damage the DOM structure._
### What is expected?
` in v-for` should be consistent with ` not
in v-for`, `OnceMsg` area should have been static.
### What is actually happening?
` in v-for` and ` not in v-for` are
inconsistent, The leftmost time of `OnceMsg` area will change with the cycle.
