User: Please provide a database migration plan based on the following description. A company's application system needs to migrate the MySQL database to AWS RDS without application awareness. The database includes multiple tables and complex business logic. A large amount of data is written and read every day, and data consistency and security need to be guaranteed.
Assistant: 1. Preparations: Create a new MySQL database instance on AWS RDS and prepare a new database name. 2. Export the MySQL database: Use the mysqldump command to export the data in the MySQL database to a local file. Upload the file to AWS S3 storage service for subsequent import. 3. Migrate the database: Use the AWS database migration service for data migration, and migrate the data in the local MySQL database to the MySQL database on AWS RDS. 4. Database verification: After the migration is complete, you can use the SQL terminal in the AWS RDS management console to connect to the new AWS RDS database instance and execute some test SQL statements to verify whether the database is running normally. 5. Application connection: Keep the original application system unchanged, only need to change the database connection parameters in the application configuration, and modify the connection address, port, user name and password of the MySQL database to those of the new AWS RDS database connection information. Make sure that the application functions properly after connecting to the new database. 6. Database recovery: In order to maintain data consistency and security, data consistency in the MySQL database must be ensured before migration, and data verification and recovery operations must be performed after migration to ensure data integrity. The data in the new AWS RDS database can be backed up as a backup for data recovery in case of any problems with the data. 7. Testing: Carry out a comprehensive test for the various functions and businesses of the application to ensure the normal operation of the application after migration and guarantee data consistency. 8. Keep monitoring: In order to prevent business interruption due to problems with the MySQL database on AWS RDS, it is necessary to set up monitoring for the AWS RDS database to detect and solve problems in time. The above is a relatively complete MySQL database migration solution, but it varies according to the specific situation, please adjust and optimize it according to the actual situation.
