### Key Advantage of the Formulation

The primary advantage of this formulation is that it allows us to leverage the independence of observations \(O_1, \ldots, O_{z+1}\) given a choice of initiator. Consequently, we can express the probability as follows:

\[
P(I = i \mid O_1, \ldots, O_{z+1}) = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{z+1} P(O_j \mid I = i) \cdot P(I = i)}{\sum_{p=1}^{h} \prod_{j=1}^{z+1} P(O_j \mid I = p) \cdot P(I = p)}
\]

Assuming a uniform prior over all possible initiators, this simplifies to:

\[
P(I = i \mid O_1, \ldots, O_{z+1}) = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{z+1} P(O_j \mid I = i)}{\sum_{p=1}^{h} \prod_{j=1}^{z+1} P(O_j \mid I = p)}
\]

### Anonymity Degradation Over Communication Rounds

Figure 12 illustrates the expected anonymity as a function of the number of communication rounds. The entropy provided by Pisces outperforms conventional random walks by more than a factor of two (in bits) after 100 communication rounds, increasing the anonymity set size by a factor of 16.

### Limitations and Future Work

While Pisces is the first decentralized design that can both scalably leverage social network trust relationships and mitigate route capture attacks, its architecture has several limitations:

1. **Sybil Defense Mechanisms**: Pisces assumes the existence of Sybil defense mechanisms to limit the number of malicious entities in the network and prevent blacklisted malicious entities from re-joining with different pseudonyms. Without such mechanisms, distributed anonymity systems, including Tor, are vulnerable to Sybil attacks.

2. **User Participation and Online Status**: Pisces requires users' social contacts to participate in the system and be online. If none of a user's social contacts are online, they cannot build anonymous circuits. To improve usability, future work will explore leveraging a user's two-hop social neighborhood in the random walk process, similar to techniques proposed by Vasserman et al. [61].

3. **Privacy of Social Contacts**: Pisces by itself does not preserve the privacy of users' social contacts. Recent work by Mittal et al. [42] describes techniques to preserve the privacy of users' social contacts while enabling the design of social network-based anonymity systems like Pisces.

4. **Network Topology**: Users who are not well-connected in the social network topology may not benefit from using Pisces. Random walks starting from these nodes may take a long time to converge to the stationary probability distribution, which provides optimal anonymity.

5. **Targeted Attacks**: Pisces does not defend against targeted attacks on an individual, where the adversary aims to infiltrate or compromise the user's social circle to increase the probability of circuit compromise. The impact of such an attack is localized to the targeted individual.

6. **Circuit Establishment Latency**: Circuit establishment in Pisces has higher latency than existing systems due to longer random walks. However, circuits can be established preemptively to mitigate this issue. Systems like Tor already build circuits preemptively.

7. **Support for Constraints**: Pisces currently does not support important constraints such as bandwidth-based load balancing and exit policies. The focus of our architecture was to secure the peer discovery process in unstructured social network topologies, and we will consider incorporating these constraints in future work.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a mechanism for decentralized anonymous communication that can securely leverage a user's trust relationships against a Byzantine adversary. Our key contribution is demonstrating that the appearance of nodes in each other's neighbor lists can be made reciprocal in a secure and efficient manner. Using theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world social network topologies, we show that Pisces significantly reduces the probability of active attacks on circuit constructions. Pisces outperforms approaches that do not leverage trust relationships, providing up to six bits higher entropy than ShadowWalker (five bits higher entropy than Tor) in a single communication round. Compared to the naive strategy of using conventional random walks over social networks (as in the Drac system), Pisces provides twice the number of bits of entropy over 100 communication rounds. We argue that the incorporation of social trust will likely be an important consideration in the design of the next generation of deployed anonymity systems.
