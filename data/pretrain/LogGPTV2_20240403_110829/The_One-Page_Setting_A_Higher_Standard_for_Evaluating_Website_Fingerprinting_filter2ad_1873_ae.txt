6.2 What Makes the One-Page Setting Difficult
Why did all evaluated defenses fail in the one-page setting? Broadly,
there can be two sources of difficulty for the one-page setting:
(1) When there is only one class, the classifier can learn to be
bolder in classifying for that class;
(2) A reduction in the total number of positive classes by itself
increases TPR and reduces FPR.
We can analyze each of these effects by performing an extra ex-
periment where the multi-page classifier is used to classify in the
one-page setting.5 Comparing the one-page and multi-page clas-
sifiers’ performance on the one-page setting will reveal the first
effect, and comparing the multi-page classifier’s performance on
the one-page and multi-page settings will show the second effect.
We focus on Front for this experiment. We perform the additional
experiment on Front and show the results in Table 5. To enable a
comparison between the two classifiers in the one-page setting, we
set a higher confidence limit for the one-page classifier to obtain
the same FPR as the multi-page classifier. The one-page classifier
then achieves a moderate 10% increase in TPR. Comparing the
multi-page classifier on the two settings, we see that it achieves a
slightly higher TPR and a 22-fold reduction in FPR in the one-page
setting. The significant reduction in FPR is likely more significant
for most scenarios, i.e., the one-page setting is difficult mostly
because having only one positive class drastically reduces FPR.
6.3 Notes on Deployment
The results of our work suggest that current defenses require a
very large overhead increase to be effective in the one-page setting.
While this means that general deployment against the one-page
setting is likely too expensive, users who desire a higher level of
privacy could still have the option to adopt it. Partial deployment of

a WF defense can be feasible: as only the users who actively install
and use the defense would incur a cost for the network, the overall
burden on the network would remain low. Our higher-overhead
modified Tamaraw can serve this purpose.
One may point out that incremental deployment can harm pri-
vacy as people who use the new version will be distinct from clients
using the old version. This is an important consideration in e.g.
browser fingerprinting and censorship resistance. Unlike these sce-
narios however, in WF, the attacker already knows the client’s
identity and only seeks to determine the client’s behavior. The
client’s discernible willingness to adopt a WF defense only tells the
attacker that the client cares about privacy, which we believe is not
valuable information considering that the same client is already
using Tor. It is nevertheless true that a larger anonymity set is
beneficial for any privacy technology.
7 RELATED WORK
7.1 WF Defenses and What Broke Them
We give a brief overview of the history of WF defenses focusing on
how they were broken.
Two early WF defenses, Adaptive Padding [14] and Traffic Mor-
phing [20], were designed for HTTPS and VPN. The former focuses
on covering interpacket timing and the latter on packet sizes. They
were found to be ineffective against the first WF attacks that could
attack Tor [3, 18]. In fact, some effective WF attacks do not use
interpacket timing and/or packet sizes [11, 15].
Adaptive Padding was later modified and improved to become
WTF-PAD [10]. It was able to show success against earlier WF
attacks, but it was later broken with DF by Sirinam et al., based on
Convolutional Neural Networks [15].
Two mimicry defenses were proposed, Supersequence [18] and
Walkie-Talkie [19], but they both assume the client has some knowl-
edge of the web pages to be loaded, and have not been proven
practical to deploy. Tor implemented its own defense based on
randomized pipelining in response to WF, but the defense has not
proven effective against WF attacks and was removed during the
upgrade to HTTP 2.0.
This work shows that three defenses, not broken in prior work,
are not sufficiently strong in the one-page setting: Front, Decoy, and
Tamaraw. Gong and Wang proposed Front [8] to cover the front of
a packet sequence with dummy packets, as it is the most feature-
rich portion of the sequence. Panchenko et al. proposed Decoy [12]

a weakness of BuFLO [7], the first regularization defense, which
was vulnerable as it did not cover packet sequences more than 10
seconds long.
7.2 Other defenses
The main goal of our work is to demonstrate the value of the
one-page setting for the evaluation of WF defenses. To do so, we
re-evaluated the best network-layer defenses, which constitute the
majority of WF defenses. There are other defenses that can be
applied to defeat WF as well, such as ALPaCA [4], which is a server-
side defense; TrafficSliver [5], which aims to ensure that the attacker
will only be able to see a small portion of the traffic6; and Glue [8],
which adds dummy packets to glue together packet sequences
belonging to different web pages. As our focus on network-layer
WF defenses suffices to show the importance of the one-page setting
for WF defense evaluation, we did not tackle the difficult problem
of implementing and comparing non-network defenses on the same
basis as network-layer defenses, and we leave it as future work.
7.3 One-Page Setting in WF
We are not aware of any work that evaluated either attacks or
defenses under the one-page setting — our results suggest that if
those defenses were, they would have been seen as ineffective. The
binary setting (two classes but with multiple monitored pages, as
in Section 6.1) has sometimes been used to evaluate WF attacks in
the open world [11, 12].
8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this work, we set out to investigate WF defenses under the one-
page setting. We found that several defenses, Front, Decoy, and
Tamaraw, left the client vulnerable to WF attacks in the one-page
setting. This was especially surprising for Tamaraw, which was
designed as a future-proof defense against which any WF attack
would fail. We found that in the one-page setting, the anonymity
sets created by Tamaraw were too severely biased towards either
class to be useful. Our investigation into bolstering these defenses
shows that Tamaraw can become useful for the one-page setting
with greater randomization at the cost of higher data overhead. We
propose that the one-page setting should be used for all defense
evaluation in the future.
We also explored a number of different WF scenarios that could
not be captured by the standard laboratory scenario. We showed
that WF attacks were indeed able to succeed in these scenarios in
the one-page setting as well. These scenarios also introduced a num-
ber of new parameters that can significantly affect the attacker’s
performance. For the selection and identification scenarios, these
include the number of total observations and the concentration of
base rate. In the future, there may be more powerful attacks that
can achieve success in these scenarios with few observations.
In our results, an improved version of Tamaraw is currently the
best defense for the one-page setting, but it is not practical for large-
scale deployment due to its high overhead costs and packet delays.
6TrafficSliver also investigates a slightly different attacker to our model: their attacker
controls Tor nodes and would be made to see partial traffic under TrafficSliver, but our
attacker is local to the client and will see all client traffic.
One of its design flaws is a fixed constant packet rate, which is
dissimilar to how real web pages are loaded; using varying packet
rates may be more efficient. Another possibility is that our pes-
simistic simulation may be over-estimating the cost of Tamaraw,
and full evaluation on a real deployment may show better results.
We would like to thank the authors of the relevant works for
sharing their code with us, as well as Gong and Wang for sharing
their data set with us to allow our evaluation.
