### 6.2 What Makes the One-Page Setting Difficult?

Why did all evaluated defenses fail in the one-page setting? Broadly, there are two primary sources of difficulty for the one-page setting:

1. **Single Class Classification**: When there is only one class, the classifier can become more aggressive in classifying for that class.
2. **Reduction in Positive Classes**: A reduction in the total number of positive classes inherently increases the True Positive Rate (TPR) and reduces the False Positive Rate (FPR).

To analyze these effects, we conducted an additional experiment using the multi-page classifier to classify in the one-page setting. By comparing the performance of the one-page and multi-page classifiers in the one-page setting, we can observe the first effect. Comparing the multi-page classifier's performance in both settings will reveal the second effect.

For this experiment, we focused on the Front defense. The results are presented in Table 5. To facilitate a fair comparison between the two classifiers in the one-page setting, we adjusted the confidence threshold of the one-page classifier to match the FPR of the multi-page classifier. This adjustment resulted in a moderate 10% increase in TPR for the one-page classifier.

When comparing the multi-page classifier's performance across the two settings, we observed a slightly higher TPR and a 22-fold reduction in FPR in the one-page setting. The significant reduction in FPR suggests that the one-page setting is challenging primarily because having only one positive class drastically reduces the FPR.

### 6.3 Notes on Deployment

Our findings indicate that current defenses require a substantial overhead increase to be effective in the one-page setting. While this makes general deployment impractical due to high costs, users who prioritize privacy could still opt for these defenses. Partial deployment of a WF defense is feasible, as only the users who actively install and use the defense would incur the network cost, keeping the overall burden low. Our modified, higher-overhead version of Tamaraw can serve this purpose.

One potential concern is that incremental deployment might harm privacy by distinguishing users who adopt the new version from those using the old version. This is a significant issue in scenarios like browser fingerprinting and censorship resistance. However, in WF, the attacker already knows the client's identity and seeks to determine their behavior. The client's willingness to adopt a WF defense only indicates their concern for privacy, which is not particularly valuable information given that they are already using Tor. Nonetheless, a larger anonymity set is always beneficial for any privacy technology.

#### 7.1 WF Defenses and What Broke Them

We provide a brief overview of the history of WF defenses and how they were broken.

- **Adaptive Padding** [14] and **Traffic Morphing** [20]: These early defenses were designed for HTTPS and VPN. Adaptive Padding focused on interpacket timing, while Traffic Morphing targeted packet sizes. Both were found ineffective against the first WF attacks on Tor [3, 18]. Some effective WF attacks do not rely on interpacket timing or packet sizes [11, 15].
- **WTF-PAD** [10]: An improved version of Adaptive Padding, it showed success against earlier WF attacks but was later broken by Sirinam et al. using Convolutional Neural Networks [15].
- **Mimicry Defenses**: **Supersequence** [18] and **Walkie-Talkie** [19] assumed the client had some knowledge of the web pages to be loaded, but neither has been proven practical to deploy.
- **Tor’s Defense**: Tor implemented a randomized pipelining defense in response to WF, but it was removed during the upgrade to HTTP 2.0 due to its ineffectiveness.

This work demonstrates that three defenses—Front, Decoy, and Tamaraw—are not sufficiently strong in the one-page setting. Front [8] covers the front of a packet sequence with dummy packets, while Decoy [12] uses fake page loads to cover real ones. Tamaraw [2] fixed a weakness in BuFLO [7], which did not cover packet sequences longer than 10 seconds.

#### 7.2 Other Defenses

Our primary goal is to highlight the value of the one-page setting for evaluating WF defenses. We re-evaluated the best network-layer defenses, which constitute the majority of WF defenses. Other defenses include ALPaCA [4], a server-side defense; TrafficSliver [5], which limits the attacker's visibility to a small portion of traffic; and Glue [8], which adds dummy packets to merge different web page sequences. As our focus is on network-layer defenses, we leave the implementation and comparison of non-network defenses for future work.

#### 7.3 One-Page Setting in WF

To our knowledge, no prior work has evaluated either attacks or defenses under the one-page setting. Our results suggest that if such evaluations had been conducted, these defenses would have been deemed ineffective. The binary setting, with two classes but multiple monitored pages, has sometimes been used to evaluate WF attacks in the open world [11, 12].

### 8 Conclusion and Future Work

In this study, we investigated WF defenses under the one-page setting. We found that several defenses, including Front, Decoy, and Tamaraw, left clients vulnerable to WF attacks. This was particularly surprising for Tamaraw, designed as a future-proof defense. In the one-page setting, Tamaraw's created anonymity sets were too biased towards either class to be useful. Our investigation into strengthening these defenses shows that Tamaraw can be made effective in the one-page setting with increased randomization, albeit at the cost of higher data overhead. We recommend using the one-page setting for all future defense evaluations.

We also explored various WF scenarios beyond the standard laboratory setting, demonstrating that WF attacks can succeed in these scenarios as well. These scenarios introduced new parameters that significantly affect the attacker's performance, such as the number of total observations and the base rate concentration. Future work may involve more powerful attacks that can succeed with fewer observations.

Currently, an improved version of Tamaraw is the best defense for the one-page setting, but it is impractical for large-scale deployment due to high overhead and packet delays. One design flaw is a fixed constant packet rate, which differs from real web page loading patterns. Varying packet rates may be more efficient. Additionally, our pessimistic simulation may overestimate Tamaraw's costs, and a full evaluation on a real deployment may yield better results.

We thank the authors of the relevant works for sharing their code and Gong and Wang for providing their dataset for our evaluation.
