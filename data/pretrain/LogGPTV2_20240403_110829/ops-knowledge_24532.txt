User: Please describe the following concepts: load balancing, CDN, reverse proxy, and provide their role in IT operation and maintenance.
Assistant: 1. Load Balancing: It refers to assigning access requests to multiple servers for processing, so that the load of each server is balanced, the response speed and processing capacity of the servers are improved, and the failure of a single server causes the entire system to be unavailable. In IT operation and maintenance, load balancing can ensure high availability and stability of the system, reduce the risk of system failure, improve system performance, and improve system scalability and maintainability. 2. Content Delivery Network (CDN: Content Delivery Network): It means that by distributing content to the cache node closest to the user, users can quickly access content and improve user experience. In IT operation and maintenance, CDN can reduce the load on the server, improve the transmission speed of content and the access speed of users, reduce the cost of bandwidth, and at the same time improve the security of the system and protect the stability and reliability of the system. 3. Reverse Proxy (Reverse Proxy): It means that the proxy server is located at the front end of the target server, accepts external requests, forwards them to the target server, and then returns the response of the target server to the requester. In IT operation and maintenance, the reverse proxy can hide the information of the real server, improve the security and resistance of the system, reduce the load on the server, improve the performance and reliability of the system, and also improve the scalability and maintainability of the system sex.
