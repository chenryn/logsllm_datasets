Question: Consider the following code snippet that attempts to include a standard system header file in a C/C++ application, but contains a mistake:

c
    include <unistd.h>
#include <unistd.h>


Which of the following corrections will properly import the 'unistd.h' header file and adhere to secure coding practices?
"A": "Replace 'include' with '#include' to correctly import the header file.",
"B": "Remove the '<' and '>' characters and use quotes ('') for a local file import.",
"C": "Comment out the second import to avoid a double inclusion error.",
"D": "Rewrite the code in a different programming language that doesn't require header files."
