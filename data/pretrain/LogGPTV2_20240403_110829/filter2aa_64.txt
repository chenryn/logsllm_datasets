### Secure Messaging for Everyday Users
#### Presented at DEFCON 23

1. **Messages**
   - **Overview**: Discuss the fundamental aspects of secure messaging, including the importance of encryption and privacy in everyday communication.

2. **Threats**
   - **Overview**: Identify and explain common threats to secure messaging, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and data breaches.

3. **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
   - **Overview**: Explain how TLS ensures the security of data in transit by encrypting the connection between the client and the server, protecting against eavesdropping and tampering.

4. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**
   - **Overview**: Describe how E2EE provides an additional layer of security by encrypting messages on the sender's device and decrypting them only on the recipient's device, ensuring that even the service provider cannot access the message content.

5. **End-to-End Server Matchmaking**
   - **Overview**: Discuss the role of server matchmaking in E2EE, where servers help establish a secure connection between users without having access to the message content.

6. **Evil Server**
   - **Overview**: Address the potential risks of a malicious or compromised server and how it can undermine the security of the messaging system.

7. **Transitive Trust**
   - **Overview**: Explain the concept of transitive trust, where trust is extended through a chain of trusted entities, and discuss its implications for secure messaging.

8. **Metadata Collection**
   - **Overview**: Highlight the importance of metadata (e.g., who is communicating with whom, when, and how often) and the privacy concerns associated with its collection and analysis.

By addressing these key points, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of secure messaging and the steps individuals can take to protect their communications.
