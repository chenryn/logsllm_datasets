lower bound for the actual probability of IP ID acceleration, as
the experimentally measured value includes inbound blocking
(i.e., if some sites experience blocking, those values would
lower the measured value). Inbound-blocked runs lower the
overall probability of acceleration. This still reﬂects a conser-
vative measurement, as a prior closer to control increases the
likelihood of false negatives, not false positives.
Lastly, we also measure the probability of IP ID acceleration
at the SYN-ACK retry point of each run. We dynamically
determine where this falls in each run using the properties the
site manifests during that run.1 As expected, the distribution
closely matches the control distribution. The differences in
the curve are explained by the dataset containing outbound
blocking. Such blocking raises the probability of acceleration
at that point, pulling the distribution slightly closer to the
injection case. We use this prior as θ1 during the outbound
SHT test.
Once we have computed the priors, we can compute the
expected number of trials to reach each of our output states
(on a per-reﬂector basis) using Equation 1. Figure 4 presents
CDFs of these results. More than 90% of reﬂectors have
40 or fewer expected trials needed to reach one of the states.
The remaining reﬂectors have a large tail and correspond to
unstable or degenerate reﬂectors. We do not need to explicitly
remove these reﬂectors from the dataset, but must refrain from
making decisions based on them in some cases.
1If a SYN-ACK retry occurs in the window adjacent to injection, we discard
that and look for the next retry. If we did not discard that measurement, the
retry would correspond to non-acceleration rather than acceleration.
Fig. 4: CDF of expected number of trials at false positive and
negative probability of 10−5 to accept one of the four SHT
hypothesis outcomes, per reﬂector. “No Inbound/Bidirectional
Blocking” means we passed our ﬁrst SHT and did not detect
inbound blocking, but have not yet attempted to differentiate
between no blocking and outbound blocking.
E. Identifying and Removing Systematic Effects
Our initial selection of sites did not address some of our site
requirements from IV, such as network ﬁltering or anycast IP
addresses. Failure to identify these sites generates systematic
effects within our results dataset. Recall that we only wish to
ﬁlter these sites when necessary. For example, in the case of
anycast sites, we can still classify them as inbound-blocked or
not blocked, but we cannot detect scenarios where the site is
outbound-blocked.
Problematic sites. We identify sites that fail to meet these
requirements by conducting a set of experiments with nine
geographically diverse vantage points. These hosts reside in
cloud service providers and universities, all of which have
limited to no network blocking as vantage points. We perform
these measurements concurrently with our primary blockage
measurements. For each site, we perform two measurements
for each vantage point. The diversity of the vantage points
enables us to identify these network effects rather than identify
censorship or blockage. These tests do not need to be globally
complete as the network effects manifest readily.
The ﬁrst measurement ensures that a vantage point can have
bidirectional communication with a site. From a vantage point,
we send ﬁve SYN packets to a site, evenly distributed over
the experiment run (approximately an hour). We monitor for
SYN-ACK replies, which demonstrate two-way communica-
tion. If a vantage point cannot reliably establish bidirectional
communication with a site, we exclude it from our further
vantage-point measurements.
In the second measurement, the measurement machine sends
a spoofed SYN packet to the site with the IP address of

a vantage point. Since we previously conﬁrmed the vantage
point can communicate with the site, any missing SYN-ACKs
or retransmissions are the result of sites not conforming to
our requirements, rather than blockage. If the vantage point
does not receive a SYN-ACK response from the site, ingress
ﬁltering or network origin discrimination may be occurring.
If the vantage point does receive a SYN-ACK, it responds
with a RST packet. If the vantage point continues to receive
multiple SYN-ACKs, the site is not correctly receiving the
vantage point’s RST packets, suggesting the site host (or its
network provider) may be anycast, employing a distributed
stateful ﬁrewall, or discriminating by trafﬁc origin. We repeat
this experiment three times to counter measurement errors
introduced by random packet loss. If a vantage point never
receives a SYN-ACK, or only ever receives multiple SYN-
ACK retries, we conservatively conclude the site exhibits
one of the unacceptable network properties from that vantage
point. Thus, we disregard its blockage results, except if the
observed measurement results cannot be a false signal due
to the site’s properties. For example,
if vantages observe
only multiple SYN-ACK retries for a site (indicating our
measurements with that site may falsely identify outbound
blocking), but our measurements detect no blocking or only
inbound blocking, we can still consider these results.
We also ﬂagged 431 sites as invalid for outbound blocking
detection as they either lacked a necessary site property
(discussed in in Section IV-B) or did not respect RST pack-
ets (perhaps ﬁltering them). To distinguish between the two
behaviors, we probed these sites with non-spoofed SYN and
RST packets using vantage points, similar to the experiments
described earlier in this section. For each site, we sent a SYN
packet from a well-connected vantage, and responded with a
RST for any received SYN-ACK. If we continued receiving
multiple SYN-ACK retries, the site did not respect our RST
packets. Otherwise, the site does properly respond to RST
packets in the non-spooﬁng setup, and might be exhibiting
an undesirable site property (as listed in Section IV-B) in our
spoof-based connectivity disruption experiments. We iterate
We ﬁnd that this relatively small number of vantage points
sufﬁces to characterize sites, as experiment results typically
remained consistent across all vantage points. All online sites
that we tested were reachable from at least three vantage
points, with 98.4% reachable at ﬁve or more. This reachability
affords us with multiple geographic vantage points to assess
each site. For 98.6% of sites, all reachable vantage points
consistently assessed the site requirement status, indicating
that we can detect site network properties widely from a few
geographically distinct locations. This approach is ultimately
best effort, as we may fail to detect sites whose behavior is
more restricted (e.g., ﬁltering only a few networks).
Through our site assessment measurements, we identiﬁed
229 sites as invalid for inbound blocking detection due to
ingress ﬁltering or network trafﬁc discrimination. These sites
were widely distributed amongst 135 ASes, each of which may
employ such ﬁltering individually or may experience ﬁltering
occurring at an upstream ISP.
this measurement three times for robustness against sporadic
packet loss, concluding that a site ignores RST packets if any
vantage point observes multiple SYN-ACK retransmissions in
all trials.
Using this approach, we identiﬁed that 64 sites (14.8% of
sites invalid for outbound blocking detection) exhibited a non-
standard SYN-ACK retransmission behavior, and conclude
that the remaining 367 sites (85.2%) are either anycast, de-
ploying stateful ﬁrewalls, or discriminating by network origin.
These sites were distributed amongst 62 ASes. The majority
are known anycast sites, with 75% hosted by CloudFlare and
7% by Fastly, both known anycast networks.
We additionally checked all sites against the Anycast dataset
produced by Cicalese et al. [14]. Our technique identiﬁed all
but 3 IP addresses. We excluded those 3 sites from our
results.
Problematic reﬂectors. A reﬂector could be subject to ﬁlter-
ing practices that differ based on the sender of the trafﬁc,
or the port on which the trafﬁc arrives. This systematic
effect can manifest as a reﬂector with signiﬁcant inbound or
outbound blocking. From manual investigation, we identify
several reﬂectors that demonstrate this property independent
of spoofed or non-spoofed trafﬁc. In all cases, such reﬂectors
were outliers within their country. To remove these systematic
effects, we ignore reﬂectors in the 99th percentile of blockage
for their country. Sites blocked by these reﬂectors do not show
a bias to the CLBL list (discussed more in Section VI). This
process removed 91 reﬂectors from our dataset.
VI. VALIDATION AND ANALYSIS
The value of the method we develop ultimately rests on the
ability to accurately measure connectivity disruption from a
large number of measurement vantage points. Validating its
ﬁndings presents challenges, as we lack widespread ground
truth, presenting a chicken-and-egg scenario. One approach,
presented in Sections VI-A and VI-B,
is to analyze the
aggregate results produced and conﬁrm they accord with
reasonable assumptions about the employment of connectivity
disruption. While doing so does not guarantee correctness, it
increases conﬁdence in the observations. The other approach
is to corroborate our ﬁndings against existing ground truth
about censored Internet trafﬁc. In Section VI-C, we perform
one such analysis, providing a limited degree of more concrete
validation.
A. Disruption Bias
Conceptually, one would expect the set of sites disrupted
by a network censor to be biased towards sites that are known
to be commonly censored. From this notion, we can examine
the set of sites blocked by each reﬂector and ask how that
population compares to the input population.
in aggregate,
Figure 5 shows,
the bias of connectivity
disruption towards commonly censored websites. 56.7% of
websites in the input site dataset are from the CLBL, demar-
cated in the plot with a vertical dotted line (which we call the

CLBL bias line). If the detection we observed was unrelated
to censorship, we would expect to ﬁnd roughly 56.7% of
that reﬂector’s blocked sites listed in the CLBL. The results,
however, show a considerable bias towards CLBL sites for
both inbound and outbound ﬁltering. We see this with the
bulk of the graph volume lying to the right of the vertical
dotted CLBL bias line. Excluding reﬂectors with fewer than
5 blocked sites to avoid small number effects, we observe that
for 99% of reﬂectors, more than 56.7% of inbound ﬁltering
is towards CLBL sites. Similarly, we ﬁnd 95% of outbound
ﬁltering biased towards the CLBL. This observed bias agrees
with our prior expectations that we should ﬁnd CLBL sites
more widely censored.
B. Aggregate Results
Site and reﬂector results. We ﬁrst explore the extent of
connectivity disruption from both the site and reﬂector per-
spective. We might naturally assume that ﬁltering will not
manifest ubiquitously. We do not expect to ﬁnd a site blocked
across the majority of reﬂectors; similarly, we should ﬁnd
most sites not blocked for any given reﬂector. This should
particularly hold since approximately half of our investigated
sites come from the Alexa top 10K most visited websites.
Although some popular Alexa websites contain potentially
sensitive content (e.g., adult or social media sites), many
provide rather benign content and are unexpected targets of
disruption.
We observe the degree of ﬁltering from the reﬂector per-
spective in Figure 6. Approximately 99% of reﬂectors en-
counter connectivity impediments in either direction for 20 or
fewer sites, with no reﬂector blocked for more than 60 sites.
This ﬁnding concurs with the assumption that site ﬁltering
at reﬂectors is not ubiquitous. On the other hand, connection

bound/bidirectional and outbound ﬁltering.

scaled x-axis.
disruption appears widespread, as 60% of reﬂectors experience
some degree of interference, corroborating anecdotal observa-
tions of pervasive censorship.
We ﬁnd inbound/bidirectional disruption occurs more com-
monly compared to outbound-only ﬁltering. In total, fewer
than 30% of reﬂectors experience any outbound-only ﬁltering,
while over 50% of reﬂectors have blocked inbound packets
from at least one site. This contrast is unsurprising, because
bidirectional ﬁltering of a blacklisted IP address is a simple
and natural censorship policy; as a result, most results will
appear as either inbound or bidirectional ﬁltering.
Figure 7 depicts a similar outlook on connectivity disruption
from the site viewpoint. We again witness that inbound or bidi-
rectional ﬁltering affects more sites than outbound ﬁltering.
Over 15% of sites are inbound-blocked along the path to at
least one reﬂector, while only 7% of sites are ever outbound-
blocked. In total, connections to 79% of websites never appear
disrupted, and over 99% of sites exhibit inaccessibility by
