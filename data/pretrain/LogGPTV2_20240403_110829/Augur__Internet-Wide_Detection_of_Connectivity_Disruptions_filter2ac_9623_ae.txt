### Lower Bound for Actual Probability of IP ID Acceleration

The experimentally measured value of the probability of IP ID acceleration includes inbound blocking. If certain sites experience blocking, it would lower the measured value. Inbound-blocked runs reduce the overall probability of acceleration. This approach provides a conservative measurement, as a prior closer to the control increases the likelihood of false negatives rather than false positives.

### Measuring IP ID Acceleration at the SYN-ACK Retry Point

We also measure the probability of IP ID acceleration at the SYN-ACK retry point of each run. We dynamically determine this point based on the properties the site manifests during that run. As expected, the distribution closely matches the control distribution. The differences in the curve are due to the dataset containing outbound blocking, which raises the probability of acceleration, pulling the distribution slightly closer to the injection case. We use this prior (θ1) during the outbound SHT test.

### Computing Expected Number of Trials

Once we have computed the priors, we can calculate the expected number of trials needed to reach each of our output states (on a per-reflector basis) using Equation 1. Figure 4 presents the CDFs of these results. More than 90% of reflectors require 40 or fewer expected trials to reach one of the states. The remaining reflectors have a large tail and correspond to unstable or degenerate reflectors. We do not need to explicitly remove these reflectors from the dataset but must refrain from making decisions based on them in some cases.

**Note:** If a SYN-ACK retry occurs in the window adjacent to injection, we discard that and look for the next retry. If we did not discard that measurement, the retry would correspond to non-acceleration rather than acceleration.

### Identifying and Removing Systematic Effects

Our initial selection of sites did not fully address some of the site requirements, such as network filtering or anycast IP addresses. Failing to identify these sites generates systematic effects within our results dataset. We only wish to filter these sites when necessary. For example, with anycast sites, we can classify them as inbound-blocked or not blocked, but we cannot detect scenarios where the site is outbound-blocked.

#### Problematic Sites

We identify sites that fail to meet these requirements by conducting experiments with nine geographically diverse vantage points. These hosts reside in cloud service providers and universities, all of which have limited to no network blocking as vantage points. We perform these measurements concurrently with our primary blockage measurements. For each site, we perform two measurements for each vantage point. The diversity of the vantage points enables us to identify network effects rather than censorship or blockage. These tests do not need to be globally complete as the network effects manifest readily.

1. **First Measurement:**
   - Ensures bidirectional communication between a vantage point and a site.
   - From a vantage point, we send five SYN packets to a site, evenly distributed over the experiment run (approximately an hour).
   - We monitor for SYN-ACK replies, which demonstrate two-way communication.
   - If a vantage point cannot reliably establish bidirectional communication with a site, we exclude it from further vantage-point measurements.

2. **Second Measurement:**
   - The measurement machine sends a spoofed SYN packet to the site with the IP address of a vantage point.
   - Since we previously confirmed the vantage point can communicate with the site, any missing SYN-ACKs or retransmissions are due to sites not conforming to our requirements, rather than blockage.
   - If the vantage point does not receive a SYN-ACK response from the site, ingress filtering or network origin discrimination may be occurring.
   - If the vantage point receives a SYN-ACK, it responds with a RST packet. If the vantage point continues to receive multiple SYN-ACKs, the site is not correctly receiving the vantage point’s RST packets, suggesting the site host (or its network provider) may be anycast, employing a distributed stateful firewall, or discriminating by traffic origin.
   - We repeat this experiment three times to counter measurement errors introduced by random packet loss.
   - If a vantage point never receives a SYN-ACK, or only ever receives multiple SYN-ACK retries, we conservatively conclude the site exhibits one of the unacceptable network properties from that vantage point. Thus, we disregard its blockage results, except if the observed measurement results cannot be a false signal due to the site’s properties.

We flagged 431 sites as invalid for outbound blocking detection as they either lacked a necessary site property or did not respect RST packets. To distinguish between the two behaviors, we probed these sites with non-spoofed SYN and RST packets using vantage points. For each site, we sent a SYN packet from a well-connected vantage and responded with a RST for any received SYN-ACK. If we continued receiving multiple SYN-ACK retries, the site did not respect our RST packets. Otherwise, the site properly responds to RST packets in the non-spoofing setup and might be exhibiting an undesirable site property in our spoof-based connectivity disruption experiments.

We find that a relatively small number of vantage points suffices to characterize sites, as experiment results typically remained consistent across all vantage points. All online sites that we tested were reachable from at least three vantage points, with 98.4% reachable at five or more. This reachability affords us multiple geographic vantage points to assess each site. For 98.6% of sites, all reachable vantage points consistently assessed the site requirement status, indicating that we can detect site network properties widely from a few geographically distinct locations. This approach is ultimately best effort, as we may fail to detect sites whose behavior is more restricted (e.g., filtering only a few networks).

Through our site assessment measurements, we identified 229 sites as invalid for inbound blocking detection due to ingress filtering or network traffic discrimination. These sites were widely distributed amongst 135 ASes, each of which may employ such filtering individually or may experience filtering occurring at an upstream ISP.

Using this approach, we identified that 64 sites (14.8% of sites invalid for outbound blocking detection) exhibited a non-standard SYN-ACK retransmission behavior, and concluded that the remaining 367 sites (85.2%) are either anycast, deploying stateful firewalls, or discriminating by network origin. These sites were distributed amongst 62 ASes. The majority are known anycast sites, with 75% hosted by CloudFlare and 7% by Fastly, both known anycast networks.

We additionally checked all sites against the Anycast dataset produced by Cicalese et al. [14]. Our technique identified all but 3 IP addresses. We excluded those 3 sites from our results.

### Problematic Reflectors

A reflector could be subject to filtering practices that differ based on the sender of the traffic or the port on which the traffic arrives. This systematic effect can manifest as a reflector with significant inbound or outbound blocking. From manual investigation, we identify several reflectors that demonstrate this property independent of spoofed or non-spoofed traffic. In all cases, such reflectors were outliers within their country. To remove these systematic effects, we ignore reflectors in the 99th percentile of blockage for their country. Sites blocked by these reflectors do not show a bias to the CLBL list (discussed more in Section VI). This process removed 91 reflectors from our dataset.

### Validation and Analysis

The value of our method ultimately rests on the ability to accurately measure connectivity disruption from a large number of measurement vantage points. Validating its findings presents challenges, as we lack widespread ground truth, presenting a chicken-and-egg scenario. One approach, presented in Sections VI-A and VI-B, is to analyze the aggregate results produced and confirm they accord with reasonable assumptions about the employment of connectivity disruption. While doing so does not guarantee correctness, it increases confidence in the observations. The other approach is to corroborate our findings against existing ground truth about censored Internet traffic. In Section VI-C, we perform one such analysis, providing a limited degree of more concrete validation.

#### Disruption Bias

Conceptually, one would expect the set of sites disrupted by a network censor to be biased towards sites that are known to be commonly censored. From this notion, we can examine the set of sites blocked by each reflector and ask how that population compares to the input population. In aggregate, Figure 5 shows the bias of connectivity disruption towards commonly censored websites. 56.7% of websites in the input site dataset are from the CLBL, demarcated in the plot with a vertical dotted line (which we call the CLBL bias line). If the detection we observed was unrelated to censorship, we would expect to find roughly 56.7% of that reflector’s blocked sites listed in the CLBL. The results, however, show a considerable bias towards CLBL sites for both inbound and outbound filtering. We see this with the bulk of the graph volume lying to the right of the vertical dotted CLBL bias line. Excluding reflectors with fewer than 5 blocked sites to avoid small number effects, we observe that for 99% of reflectors, more than 56.7% of inbound filtering is towards CLBL sites. Similarly, we find 95% of outbound filtering biased towards the CLBL. This observed bias agrees with our prior expectations that we should find CLBL sites more widely censored.

#### Aggregate Results

**Site and Reflector Results:**
- **Relector Perspective:**
  - Approximately 99% of reflectors encounter connectivity impediments in either direction for 20 or fewer sites, with no reflector blocked for more than 60 sites.
  - This finding concurs with the assumption that site filtering at reflectors is not ubiquitous.
  - On the other hand, connection disruption appears widespread, as 60% of reflectors experience some degree of interference, corroborating anecdotal observations of pervasive censorship.
  - Inbound/bidirectional disruption occurs more commonly compared to outbound-only filtering. In total, fewer than 30% of reflectors experience any outbound-only filtering, while over 50% of reflectors have blocked inbound packets from at least one site.

- **Site Perspective:**
  - Over 15% of sites are inbound-blocked along the path to at least one reflector, while only 7% of sites are ever outbound-blocked.
  - In total, connections to 79% of websites never appear disrupted, and over 99% of sites exhibit inaccessibility by fewer than 10% of reflectors.
