### Issue Report: Snippet List Rendering Problems

While reviewing the snippet list, I encountered some rendering irregularities. Specifically, there are 5 snippets in the list, but only 4 are initially visible. The full set of 5 snippets only becomes visible after I navigate through the entire list using the arrow keys. Without the sample screenshot, which clearly shows 5 items, I would not have known that one snippet was missing from the initial view.

Additionally, I observed other partial rendering issues, such as the duplication shown in the attached image.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open the snippet list.
2. Observe that only 4 snippets are visible.
3. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the list.
4. Notice that a fifth snippet appears after navigating through the list.

**Expected Behavior:**
- All 5 snippets should be visible immediately upon opening the list.

**Actual Behavior:**
- Only 4 snippets are visible until the list is fully navigated.

**Additional Observations:**
- Partial rendering issues, such as the duplication shown in the attached image, were also noted.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
