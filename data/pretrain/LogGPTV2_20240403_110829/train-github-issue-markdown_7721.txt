#3159
When looking through the snippet list I get some strange rendering.
There are definitely 5 snippets in the list but only 4 show up until I arrow
through the complete set of 5. Once I did that the list rendered correctly. I
would not have known there were 5 items if the sample screenshot did not show
5 (vs the 4 I could see).
I also saw some other partial rendering issues such as the double up in the
image below.
