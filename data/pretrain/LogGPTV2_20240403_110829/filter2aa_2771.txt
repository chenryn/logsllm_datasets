# Trolling with Math: An In-Depth Exploration

## Introduction
In this document, we will explore the concept of "Trolling with Math" in the context of assembly and low-level programming. We'll delve into various techniques, their implications, and potential pitfalls.

## Key Concepts
- **frank^2**: Pronounced "frank 2" (the caret is for flair).
- **"that guy with the hat"**.
- **DC949** and **DC310**: References to specific events or communities.

## Content Overview
- **Math Simplification**: Your math teacher might have made it more complicated than necessary.
  - Example: `f(x) = x * 7`
  - Lambda function: `(lambda x: x * 7)`
  - Java method: 
    ```java
    public static int multiplyBySevenAndReturn(Integer x) { return x * 7; }
    ```
  - Mathematical functions can be complex, but this is sufficient for our discussion.

- **Assembly Instructions**:
  - **JMP and CALL**: These instructions use offsets, not immediate values.
    - Example: `JMP 00401000` means a jump a few bytes ahead.
    - **CALL** also uses offsets and modifies the stack.
  - **Register-Based Jumps**: When using a register like `EAX`, the instruction jumps to the address stored in the register.
    - Examples: `CALL EAX`, `CALL [EAX]`, `JMP [EAX]`

- **Short Jumps**:
  - **JMP SHORT**: Jumps within a range of -127 to 127.
  - **Regular JMP**: Jumps within a much larger range, from -2147483647 to 2147483647.
  - **No CALL SHORT**: This does not exist.

- **Instruction Execution**:
  - Each instruction is executed sequentially, which can be seen as an unconditional jump to the next instruction.
  - This allows for the placement of instructions in arbitrary memory locations, provided each is followed by an unconditional jump.

- **Memory Layout**:
  - A one-dimensional array can be interpreted as a two-dimensional array, allowing for the placement of instructions in a grid-like structure.
  - This technique, combined with null space between instructions, enables the drawing of instructions in memory.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Disassemble Instructions**.
2. **Allocate Memory**: Allocate a buffer significantly larger than the instructions.
3. **Determine f(x)**: For each instruction, calculate its position using a function.
4. **Place Instructions**: Place each instruction at the calculated (x, y) location.
5. **Unconditional Jumps**: Link instructions with unconditional jumps.
6. **Mark Executable**: Mark the new memory section as executable.
7. **Run**: Execute the code.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **JMP and CALL Issues**:
  - **Offsets**: When placed arbitrarily, JMP and CALL instructions may no longer point to the correct locations.
  - **Short JMPs**: Can be fixed, but long JMPs are more problematic.
  - **Register-Based Jumps**: Hard to determine at runtime, requiring additional work.

- **f(x) Formulas**:
  - Implementing these formulas in code can be complex, requiring function pointers and class pointers.

- **Handling Offsets**:
  - Convert `JMP SHORT` to `JMP PANTS` during disassembly.
  - Recalculate and replace old offsets with new ones.

## Advanced Techniques
- **Conditional Jumps**: Use conditional jumps for better control flow.
- **Opaque Predicates**: Use predicates to hide the true intent of the code.
- **Hardening**:
  - **Pre-amble**: Used for repairing after-effects and anti-debug code.
  - **Post-script**: Used for obfuscation, anti-debug, and encryption/decryption.

## Drawbacks
- **Code Complexity**: The more complex the obfuscation, the harder it is to maintain.
- **Memory Footprint**: Large datasets and significant memory usage.
- **Function Pointers**: Clever use of function pointers can break easily.
- **OOP Paradigms**: Using C++ and STL for efficiency can complicate things further.
