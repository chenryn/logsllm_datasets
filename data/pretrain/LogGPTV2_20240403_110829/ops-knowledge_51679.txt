User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to know from which yum repository a package has been installed? After I have installed a package by yum (with multiple repositories configured), how can I find from which repository it has been installed?

If I run yum info package-name (or yum list package-name), I can only see that the package is "installed".

Assistant: With yum-utils installed, repoquery will provide the information you seek (here 'epel' being the repository).
