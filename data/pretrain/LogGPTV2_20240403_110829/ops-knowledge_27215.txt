User: I want to read some data from a port in Python in a while true.
Then I want to grab the data from Python in Erlang on a function call.
So technically in this while true some global variables is gonna be set and on the request from erlang those variables will be return.
I am using erlport for this communication but what I found was that I can make calls and casts to the python code but not run a function in python (in this case the main) and let it run. when I tried to run it with the call function erlang doesn't work and obviously is waiting for a response.
How can I do this? 
any other alternative approaches is also good if you think this is not the correct way to do it.
Assistant: Ports communicate with Erlang VM by standard input/output. Does your python program use stdin/stdout for other purposes? If yes - it may be a reason of the problem.
