User:  Describes the concept of server clusters and how they can be used to improve application availability and performance.
Assistant: server cluster is a cluster of servers (called nodes) that can handle a large number of user requests simultaneously. Each server can handle a certain amount of requests. When the amount of requests increases, the capacity and performance of the system can be increased by adding more servers. Server clustering improves application availability and performance because it spreads the load across multiple servers, reducing the burden on a single server and reducing the impact of a single point of failure. In a cluster, each node can share the request processing load, and if one of the nodes experiences a failure or goes down, the other nodes can take over the load and continue to provide services, thereby maintaining the availability of the system. Server clusters can also distribute requests to different nodes through load balancing, thereby improving system performance. Load balancing can automatically select the most suitable server for processing requests according to the performance and availability of nodes, and distribute requests to these nodes according to a certain strategy, so that each node has efficient parallel processing capabilities. Server clusters are often equipped with high-speed network interconnects to quickly transfer data and coordinate request processing between nodes. At the same time, certain automated management and monitoring tools are also required to ensure that the status and performance of each node in the cluster can be monitored and adjusted in real time.
