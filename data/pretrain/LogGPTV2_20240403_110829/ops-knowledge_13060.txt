I'm currently using PyDev with Eclipse on a Mac, and my Python interpreter is MacPorts Python 2.6. My Python package is located in the Eclipse workspace, but I can only get my scripts to run if I first install the package into the `site-packages` folder of the MacPorts Python 2.6. This means that every time I make a code change, I have to uninstall and then reinstall the package for the Python interpreter to recognize the changes.

How can I configure Eclipse to include my workspace directory (e.g., `{workspace}/mypythonproject`) in the Python path, so that I don't need to repeatedly install and uninstall the package?

### Solution:

To configure Eclipse to include your project directory in the Python path, follow these steps:

1. **Open Eclipse Preferences:**
   - Go to `Window > Preferences`.

2. **Navigate to PyDev Interpreter Settings:**
   - In the Preferences window, navigate to `PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter`.

3. **Select Your Python Interpreter:**
   - Ensure that the correct Python interpreter (MacPorts Python 2.6) is selected. If it is not set up, you can add it by clicking `New...` and browsing to the Python executable.

4. **Add Your Project Directory to the Python Path:**
   - Under the `Libraries` tab, click `New Folder...`.
   - Browse to and select the directory of your Python project (e.g., `{workspace}/mypythonproject`).
   - Click `OK` to add the directory to the list of libraries.

5. **Apply the Changes:**
   - Click `Apply and Close` to save the changes.

Eclipse will now include your project directory in the Python path, and you should be able to run your scripts directly from the Eclipse environment without needing to install the package into the `site-packages` folder each time.

### Running Scripts from the Command Line:

If you also want to run your scripts from the command line, you will need to add the project directory to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:{path_to_your_workspace}/mypythonproject
```

Replace `{path_to_your_workspace}` with the actual path to your Eclipse workspace directory. After adding this line, reload your shell configuration or open a new terminal session to apply the changes.

This setup will allow you to run your scripts both within Eclipse and from the command line without the need for repeated installations.
