### Subject: Setting up a Site-to-Site VPN between Two Sites

**Introduction:**
I am new to this group and have been impressed with the forum so far. I am seeking advice on setting up a site-to-site VPN over a cable connection between two sites, each with approximately six clients running Windows XP or 7. All workstations will be running Windows, and I am still considering whether to install Server 2008, as it may not be necessary.

**Hardware Considerations:**
I am considering using the NetGear FVS318 switch at both sites for the connection. While I have some networking experience, I am not familiar with this specific setup. My requirements are as follows:
- **Low Cost:** The solution should be budget-friendly.
- **Minimal Latency:** To ensure smooth operation.
- **Automatic Recovery:** The system should automatically recover from power or cable outages.
- **One-Time Setup:** Once the workstations and servers are configured, users should not need to perform any additional login steps to use the VPN. It should function seamlessly, as if they were on a single network, requiring only a standard Windows login.

**Questions and Requests:**
- **Device Recommendations:** Are there any specific devices you would recommend for this setup? I have heard that entry-level firewalls from Cisco/Linksys, SonicWall, Juniper, or WatchGuard might be suitable. I am also considering the NetGear FVS318.
- **Setup Process:** Could you provide guidance on how to set up the site-to-site VPN, including any specific configurations or best practices?
- **Windows Domain Controllers (DCs):** Is it advisable to set up a Windows DC at each site to handle authentication and local document storage, even if the WAN connection goes down?
- **Static IP Addresses:** Should I obtain static IP addresses for the internet connections at both sites?

**Additional Information:**
- **Client OS:** Windows XP or 7
- **Number of Clients per Site:** Approximately 6
- **Network Equipment Considered:** NetGear FVS318

Thank you in advance for your help and any tips you can provide!

Best regards,
Mike
