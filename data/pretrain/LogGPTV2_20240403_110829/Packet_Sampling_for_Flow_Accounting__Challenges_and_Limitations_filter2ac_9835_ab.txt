Packet Sampling for Flow Accounting: Challenges and Limitations 
65 
The vigilant reader may miss the sampling parameters n and N in the formula. But for 
1-in-K sampling the population size N is formed by the stratum size K and the number 
of strata L (N=K*L). The sample size n equals the number of strata L. 
Theoretical  Comparison  of  Schemes.  A  scheme  provides  a  higher  estimation 
accuracy if the standard error is smaller. That means 1-in-K sampling performs better 
if the following condition holds:

That  means  we  get  a  higher  accuracy  with  1-in-K  sampling  if  the  mean  of  the 
variances per subinterval (over all subintervals) is smaller than the variance within the 
whole measurement interval. 
the 
formula  gets  more  complex,  because  per-flow 
characteristics need to be taken into account. With the formulas for the standard error 
for n-out-of-N and stratified sampling for case II we get:

In order to assess the accuracy for 1-in-K sampling one would need information about 
per flow characteristics for each subinterval. In contrast to n-out-of-N sampling those 
parameters cannot be approximated for 1-in-K sampling.

4   Accuracy Assessment in Practice 
As  we  have  seen  we  need  the  flow  characteristics  to  calculate  the  accuracy.  Since 
those  are  unknown,  they  have  to  be  estimated  from  sampled  values.  A  second 
problem  is  the  amount  of  data  that  needs  to  be  stored  to  provide  an  accuracy 
statement.  Storing  per-packet  information  results  in  too  much  data  even  if  only 
sampled  packets  are  stored.  Therefore  we  here  show  how  to  calculate  the  accuracy 
from aggregated information. In addition we show how IPFIX Information Elements 
(IEs) can be utilized to export the required values needed for the accuracy assessment. 
Accuracy  Assessment  from  Sampled  Packets.  With  the  sampling  parameters,  the 
number of the sampled packets and their packet sizes we can provide estimates for the 
relevant parameters for n-out-of-N sampling.

For 1-in-K sampling the assessment from sampled values is problematic. As can be 
σ  per 
seen from the formulas in section 3 we would need to estimate
subinterval.  Since  we  select  only  one  packet  per  subinterval,  it  is  not  possible  to 
calculate  acceptable  estimates  for  mean  and  variance.  As  a  consequence  we  cannot 
provide a practical accuracy statement from the sampled values for 1-in-K sampling. 
In empirical investigations we have seen that for many flows the accuracy for 1-in-K 
is close to the n-out-of-N model with current packet size distributions. Therefore the 
n-out-of-N accuracy often provides a good approximation.

Accuracy Assessment from  Aggregated Information and IPFIX. Cisco currently 
stores  for  each  flow  the  number  nf  of  packets  in  the  sample  and  the  sum  of  packet 
sizes from the sampled packets. With these two values and the sampling parameters n 
and  N,  one  can  easily  calculate  the  estimates 
fx   ((15),(16)).  But  the 
  is  not  possible  with  the  stored  values.  A

calculation of 
 using (17) would require knowledge about all packet sizes in the 
sample.  In order to avoid the storage of all packet sizes from the sampled packets, 
one can use an alternative variance calculation based on the sum and the square sum 
of the selected packet sizes.

Sum and square sum can be updated when a packet is selected and the packet sizes 
themselves do not need to be stored. If we insert (19) into formula (18) one can easily 
derive  the  accuracy  from  the  stored  aggregated  values  (sum  and  square  sum).  We 
recommended  the  storage  of  the  square  sum  to  Cisco.  It  has  been  added  as  an 
information element to the flow information export protocol IPFIX [12], and therefore 
will  be  available  in  Cisco  routers  in  future.  Table  2  shows  the  IPFIX  and  PSAMP 
information elements ([11], [13]) that provide the required values for calculating an 
accuracy statement. 
If sampling is applied those values are calculate from the sampled packets and can 
be used to derive the required estimates. For count-based measurement intervals the 
number of packets in the measurement interval is preconfigured and can be reported 
with  the  samplingPopulation  IE.    For  time-based  measurement  intervals  one  can 
report the number by defining an IPFIX flow that comprises all packets on the link

5   Experiments 
We investigate the achievable accuracy for different schemes, classification rules and 
interval lengths with real traffic traces from 3 different networks. We show how many 
flows conform to given accuracy requirements.  
Traces.  The  first  trace  set  is  from  a  large  European  operator  (denoted  as  OP).  The 
second set we collected at CIRIL [17], a regional network provider that interconnects 
universities and research institutes with the French Research and Education Network 
RENATER. Measurements were taken on a 1 Gbit multimode Ethernet access link to 
the  national  research  network.  As  a  third  source  we  used  the  6  hour  traces 
NZIX07m06d12h (NZIX1) and NZIX07m06d06h (NZIX2) from [14]. We performed 
experiments  with  two  different  classification  schemes.  S24D24  distinguishes  flows 
with respect to source and destination network both with a 24 bit netmask. S24D00 
distinguishes  flows  only  with  respect  to  the  source  network.  If  packets  of  the  same 
flow  are  observed  in  different  measurement  intervals  they  are  counted  as  separate 
flows. Table 3 shows the number of flows observed for different classification rules 
and interval lengths (in number of packets). We use a letter per setting as identifier.

Fig.  1  (left)  shows  a  summarized  representation  of  all  flows  in  the  CIRIL  trace 
(setting  D).  Each  dot  represents  a  flow.  The  dimensions  are  the  three  flow 
characteristics that are relevant for the estimation accuracy: number of packets, packet 
size mean and variance (represented by the standard deviation). With settings D the 
68 
T. Zseby, T. Hirsch, and B. Claise 
trace  contains  3,588,520  flows.  The  majority  of  flows  are  small.  Only  4,624  flows 
consist of more than 200,000 packets (not shown in graph). The peak at the standard 
deviation  of  zero  and  small  means  is  caused  by  flows  with  packets  of  equal  sizes. 
Several  flows  consist  of  only  one  packet.  Those  also  have  a  standard  deviation  of 
zero.  For  the  other  traces  and  settings  we  observed  similar  flow  distributions. 
Especially the existence of a majority of small flows was observed for all traces. 
Conformance  to  Accuracy  Requirements.  First  we  calculate  the  achievable 
accuracy using the observed real flow characteristics and formula (6). Table 4 shows 
how many flows in the traces conform to given accuracy requirements for a sampling 
fraction of f=5%. The accuracy is given by the threshold t for the standard error.
