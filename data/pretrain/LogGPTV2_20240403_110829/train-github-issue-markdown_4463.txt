**Guten Tag!**

For my project, I used Rust version 0.8. After starting to work on a parser module, `rustc` crashed during compilation. I then decided to switch to the latest version from Git. Now, I am encountering the following error message:

```
task 'rustc' has overflowed its stack
[1]    2625 illegal hardware instruction (core dumped)  rustc main.rs
```

My project compiles perfectly without the line:

```rust
pub mod parser;
```

in `main.rs`. However, I do not receive any specific error messages that indicate what is going wrong. Therefore, I believe this might be an issue, which is why I am reaching out for help.

Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide on the IRC and with my problem!

Best regards,
