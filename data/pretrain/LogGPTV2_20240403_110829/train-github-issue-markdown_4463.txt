 **Guten Tag!**  
For my project i used the 0.8 version of rust.  
After i started to work on a parser module for my project.  
rustc crashed at compile time and i decided to go and use the git version now
i get an error message.
    task 'rustc' has overflowed its stack
    [1]    2625 illegal hardware instruction (core dumped)  rustc main.rs
My project compiles without
    pub mod parser;
in my main.rs perfectly.
But i don't get an error message, what says what goes wrong.  
So I think thats an issue so thats reason you read that.
**Thanks for every help on the irc and for my problem!**
