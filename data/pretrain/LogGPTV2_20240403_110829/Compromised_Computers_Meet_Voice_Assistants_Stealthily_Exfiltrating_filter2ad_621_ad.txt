choose f1 = fA + fB and f2 = fA, it produces (fA + fB), fA
and fB in the recording. Thus, there are only 6 possible values
of the additional frequency (fA + fB) that lie in voiceband
and will be present in the recording.
Golay code for error correction can correct at most 3 bits
errors in a 24-bit string [37]. It comes with an encoder E()
and a decoder D(). A 12-bit binary string message, M, will be
encoded into a 24-bit Golay code word, W = E(M ). Since
one DTMF tone can represent 6 bits of binary strings, one
Golay code word is transmitted by 4 tones. After receiving the
code, every 4 tones will be decoded into one Golay code word,
W

D. Data Exﬁltration
We consider the scenario in which an attacker has success-
fully compromised a computer and wants to exﬁltrate sensitive
data that is available at the computer. To bypass network
defenses, malware on the compromised computer uses a VA
and the phone channel to transmit data to the attacker. To
accomplish this, the malware must ﬁrst locate the data and
convert it to an audio ﬁle. This is done using DTMF tones
and the encoding scheme described by us. Once this is done,
the tone audio is modulated with a carrier frequency chosen
to make its transfer via a computer stealthy. These steps have
to be completed before transmission can begin by playing the
audio ﬁle via the computer speakers.
To begin data transfer, ﬁrst the VA must be given a com-
mand to make a phone call to a phone number chosen by the
attacker. Such an activation command can be hidden and made
unnoticeable as demonstrated by previous research [1], [5],
[6], [34], [40], [41]. After the activation, desired audio will be
played by the computer. The VA transmits this audio over the
phone call and it is recorded at the receiving end of the call. To
recover the transferred data, prior to decoding, the audio in the
recording is ﬁrst aligned. This can be accomplished by adding
a preﬁx to the audio. We then feed the audio to the Goertzel
Algorithm to ﬁnd out frequencies in each tone. Based on the
frequencies found, a binary representation is generated. We
use such representation as a sequence of 24-bit Golay code
words, which are then decoded. Finally, the decoded binary
data is converted back to characters in the original ﬁle.
VI. EVALUATION
To evaluate the efﬁcacy of the data exﬁltration scheme de-
veloped by us, we implemented a proof-of-concept prototype
system. This system allowed us to demonstrate the feasibility
of data exﬁltration via a VA and the phone channel, and we
also used it to experimentally assess how accurately data can
be transmitted and what transfer rates can be achieved. In
particular, we want to study the factors that impact error rates
(e.g., incorrect characters in messages received in the phone
recording at a phone number to which a call is made by
the VA). The transfer accuracy is impacted by a number of
parameters, some of which could be under the control of the
attacker. Our experiments allowed us to study the impact of
the following key parameters.
1) Tone length: Tone length describes the time duration for
which a single tone is played. Shorter tones lead to faster
data transfer but could also increase errors due to signal
leakage across tones.
2) Distance between computer and VA: The computer from
which data is exﬁltrated could be several feet away
from the VA. Increased distance allows greater ﬂexibility

for attacker but could increase transmission error rates
because of reduced energy level of the audio signal that
will be received at the VA.
3) Carrier frequencies: We modulate DTMF tone audio
with a carrier frequency to achieve stealthiness. Higher
carrier frequencies, which are closer to 20 kHz, are
inaudible to almost all people and would not raise an
alert. However, higher frequencies introduce more errors
because they suffer higher attenuation with distance.
We conduct experiments to explore the stealthiness and
transmission accuracy tradeoffs.
4) Background noise: We saw that additive background
noise can increase the energy level of a frequency that is
different than the tone frequencies. This leads to errors
reducing accuracy.
We report results of experiments that allowed us to explore
the tradeoffs introduced by these parameters. We ﬁrst describe
the experimental setup and then present the results.
A. Experimental Setup
In our experiments, we use an Amazon Echo Plus to dial the
attacker controlled phone number. We record and amplitude
modulate audio on VHFS as described in Section IV-C. We
ﬁrst play the command to make the phone call and then play
carrier modulated audio after call set up. Audacity, an open
source application used for audio processing, is used to play
the audio on a Macbook Pro 15” 2018 at 100% volume. The
volume can be varied under program control but we used the
highest level to explore how far the VA could be located from
the computer. The audio goes over air to an Echo placed at
various distances.
The attacker phone number is a Google Voice number,
which allows voicemail call recordings to be downloaded
from its website. hen adding background sound, we chose an
ambient night time noise to simulate a more likely time for
an attack and played it from an iPhone 6 at 100% volume at
5 inches away from the Amazon Echo Plus. We vary the tone
length from 50 ms to 12 ms to explore speed of transmission.
For measuring the possible attack range, the distance between
the computer and the Echo varies from 0 inch to 100 inches.
Also, different carrier frequencies between 15 kHz and 20
kHz are used to explore the tradeoff between stealthiness and
accuracy.
B. Results
We measure transmission accuracy under various settings
of the parameters described above. If n bits are transmitted
and m of those bits are received correctly, percent accuracy is
deﬁned as m/n×100. Since 8 bits encode a character, we also
consider the number of characters that are received in error.
We plot accuracy when different parameters are varied.
Tone Length: In Figure 8a, we plot accuracy as it varies with
tone length when various carrier frequencies are used to make
the audio transmission less noticeable. As the tone length in-
creases, the accuracy grows. This can be explained as follows.
First, if the tone is too short, the adjacent tones will interfere
with each other due to signal distortions introduced by the
speaker and microphone; second, a shorter tone will result
in lower amount of accumulated energy level for a frequency
compared with noise, leading to incorrect decoding. When the
tone length is longer than 40 ms, the accuracies are all above
90% except for 20 kHz modulation at 25 inch distance. In this
case, accuracy is lower as there are usually about 1/4 character
errors after error correction. When increasing the modulation
frequency, we can see that the accuracy drops drastically when
tone length is less than 20 ms. If we increase the tone length to
50 ms, we get closer to 90% accuracy even with 20 kHz carrier
frequency for modulation and 25 inches distance between the
computer and the VA. As can be seen, lines corresponding to
carrier frequencies 15 kHz and 18 kHz go up to about 99%
with either distance. This demonstrates the tradeoff between
stealthiness and transmission accuracy.
If the VA is very close to the computer, data can be
transmitted with high accuracy. We can also see the number
of characters that are received in error when the distance
is 0 inch in Figure 8d. No characters are received in error
when the tone length is 50 ms. From these experiments, we
ﬁnd that 50 ms tone length offers good accuracy and we use
this value in all other experiments. If the tone length is 50
ms and we leave a 50 ms gap between adjacent tones, there
will be 10 tones/second. Each tone represents 6 binary bits,
then the bit rate is 60 bits/second when no error correction
is done. The highest bit rate is reached when the tone length
is 12 ms, that is, a bit rate of 250 bits/second is achieved
but many characters are received in error. Errors will be
problematic when sensitive data such as passwords or social
security numbers are exﬁltrated. In case of normal text, it may
be possible to correct the erroneous characters but we do not
explore this here.
Distance: We varied the distance from 0 inch, where Echo
is right in front of the laptop computer to 100 inches, where
Echo is placed at one side of a bedroom while the laptop
is at the other side. As expected, in Figure 8e, the accuracy
worsens as we increase the distance between the Echo and
the laptop. When modulating with 15 kHz and 18 kHz carrier,
the accuracies are all above 90% even at 100 inches. The
errors are about 1/8 at 100 inches distance as can be seen in
Figure 8f. While 20 kHz modulation can reach 100% accuracy
at 0 inch without adding noise and nearly 90% with noise
playing, the accuracy goes down quickly as distance grows.
In our experiments, the range is limited to 100 inches (over
eight feet). Although errors could be reduced by lowering
modulation frequency or increasing the tone length, a tradeoff
exists between stealthiness and errors.
Modulation Frequency: We discuss the impact of modulation
frequency when the tone length is ﬁxed to 50 ms. When the
frequency is 15 kHz in Figure 8e, the accuracies at all distance
are all close to 100%, even when the distance is 100 inches.
When we increase the frequency to 18 kHz, as shown in
in Figure 8e, the accuracy is still above 89% even at 100
inches distance. Only when the frequency reaches 20 kHz, the
accuracy drops quickly after 0 inch. From these experiments,
