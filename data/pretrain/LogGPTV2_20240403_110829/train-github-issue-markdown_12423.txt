Currently several dont_... flags don't work as one could expect if their value
is False: `dont_merge_cookies=False` is the same as `dont_merge_cookies=True`
\- only the presence of a flag is checked. What about checking actual values?
Affected options:
  * dont_merge_cookies #846
  * dont_redirect
  * dont_retry
  * dont_cache from #821
There is also 'dont_filter' argument for Request; it handles False values.
