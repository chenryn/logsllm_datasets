##### Issue Type:
  * Bug Report
##### Ansible Version:
    ansible 2.0.1.0
##### Ansible Configuration:
##### Environment:
Mac OSX
##### Summary:
Using tags inside included files and access the tags as variable was working
in version 1.7.2. In later version this is broken.
Note: The debug/print statements below are only in there to show the issue
(tags not being able to be accessed as variable). The actual issue is that the
tags was able to be used in when clause but now is not able to.
##### Steps To Reproduce:
  1. Create two files as below one yaml includes the other.
  2. ansible-playbook ./anstest.yml
anstest.yml
    ---
    - name: Test tags in when caluse
      hosts: localhost
      tasks:
        - { include: anstest1.yml, tags: ['removefromlb'] }
anstest1.yml
    ---
      - debug: msg="tags yo {{tags}}" # tags could be printed as variable - worked in 1.7.1 - doesn't work in 1.9.1 or 2.0
      - name: Remove from lb   # how it was being used - worked in 1.7.1 - doesn't work in 1.9.1 or 2.0
        debug: msg="hello world"
        tags: removefromlb
        when: "'removefromlb' in tags"
##### Expected Results:
Not error.
##### Actual Results:
Errors out with not being able to print tags variable which leads to issues
around usage in when clause.
