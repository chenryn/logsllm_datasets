Figure 7: Request latency vs. time for two scheduling
scenarios (long runs simulated 120 h wall time). As
expected the max. latency for NL is decreased due to
strict priority. In this scenario, there are more incom-
ing NL requests (fNL = 0.99 · 4/5 , fCK = 0.99 · 1/5 and
fMD = 0.99 · 1/5).

Figure 8: Validation against data from NV hardware
(Lab scenario). Fidelity (a) and probability an attempt
succeeds (b) in terms of α (Section 4.4) shows good
agreement between hardware and simulation points
(each at least 300 pairs averaged, 5s−117s simulated
time, 500k−10.000k attempts, 122 hours wall time). The-
oretical model [53] as visual guide (solid line).
6.3 Scheduling
We take a first step studying the effect of scheduling strate-
gies on the performance when using mixed kinds of requests.
Part of simulating the performance of a scheduling strategies
can certainly be done without implementing all details of
the physical entanglement generation. However, since we
do simulate these details we can first confirm that different
scheduling strategies below do not affect the average fidelity
in these scenarios. Here, we examine two simple scheduling
strategies: (1) first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and (2) a strategy
where NL of priority 1 has a strict highest priority, and use a
weighted fair queue (WFQ) for CK (priority 2) and MD (prior-
ity 3), where CK has 10 times the weight of MD. With these
scheduling strategies, we simulate two different request pat-
terns ((i) uniform and (ii) no NL more MD), 102 times over
24 wall time hours each and extract the performance metrics
of throughput and scaled request latency, see table 1.
As expected we see a drastic decrease of the average scaled
latency for NL when giving it strict priority: 10.3 s with FCFS
and 3.5 s with WFQ. For CK there is similarly a decrease in
average scaled latency, however smaller than for NL, 10.1 s
and 6.5 s for FCFS and WFQ respectively. For MD the average
scaled latency goes up in both cases when using WFQ instead
of FCFS, by factors of 2.49 (uniform) and 1.28 (no NL more
MD).
We observe that the throughput gets less affected by the
scheduling strategy than the latency for these scenarios. The
maximal difference between the throughput for FCFS and
WFQ is by a factor of 1.16 (for MD in the scenario of no NL

for all requests goes down from 2.75 (5.99) 1/s for FCFS to
2.44 (5.92) 1/s for WFQ in the case of uniform (no NL more
MD).
7 CONCLUSION
Our top down inventory of design requirements, combined
with a bottom up approach based on actual quantum hard-
ware allowed us to take quantum networks a step further
on the long path towards their large-scale realization. Our
work readies QL2020, and paves the way towards the next
step, a robust network layer control protocol. The link layer
may now be used as a robust service without detailed knowl-
edge of the physics of the devices. We expect that at the
network layer, and when considering larger quantum mem-
ories, smart scheduling strategies will be important not only
to combat memory lifetimes but also to coordinate actions
of different nodes in time, calling for significant effort in
computer science and engineering.
