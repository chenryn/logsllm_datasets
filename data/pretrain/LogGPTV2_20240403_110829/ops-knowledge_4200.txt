User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to combat/prevent repeated unauthorized attempts to login to my postfix server? I recently setup my first postfix server and am loving life. :)

But, today I logged into the server to debug some connectivity issues that ended up being on my end, and noticed in the mail log that there was one IP that kept hammering the SASL login, and failing obviously. I banned the IP with ufw, but that's not a very efficient solution. What I'm left wondering is why this sort of behavior is allowed by default, and what I can do to mitigate against these types of attacks.


Why was this IP allowed to repeatedly fail to autheticate, and not blacklisted? What do I change to make that happen?
Is there some way I can setup notifications or alerts to this sort of failure pattern if I can't automatically handle the situation, and need to manually block the IP with ufw?
Is there any real harm in just letting these poop birds try to break into my system willy nilly? Should I be worried about this?

Assistant: Regarding point 1
For Debian based systems you could use fail2ban.
You can install it with sudo apt install fail2ban (or running it as root user, when you don't have sudo rights.)

If you are running a limited VM you can try denyhosts

To install this, you have to sudo apt install denyhosts

Both do the same, prevent intruders to bruteforce your Server, however fail2ban has the ability to check on a periode of time to prevent the same IP checking your server again

For point 2
You can setup Action on fail2ban and denyhosts to get notifications about the executed Actions.

And regarding point 3

If they gain access, they either make this device to a Zombie or Spam Sender or both, so dont use a generic password. My Servers are also checked daily from random IPs.
