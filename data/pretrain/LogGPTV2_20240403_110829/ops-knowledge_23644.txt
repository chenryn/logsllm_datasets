User: Please write a Python script for converting all comma-separated value (CSV) format in a text file to Tab-separated value (TSV) format.
Assistant: The following is the Python script to achieve this function: ```python import csv # Input and output file paths input_file = "input.csv" output_file = "output.tsv" # Open input and output files with open(input_file, 'r') as csv_file, open(output_file, 'w') as tsv_file: csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file) tsv_writer = csv.writer(tsv_file, delimiter='\t') # Process the content of the input file line by line for row in csv_reader: # Convert rows in CSV format to TSV format tsv_row = '\t'.join(row) # Write rows in TSV format to the output file tsv_writer.writerow([tsv_row]) print(f"The CSV format file {input_file } Convert to TSV format file {output_file}") ``` This script uses the csv module in the Python standard library to process CSV files and write the converted results into TSV files. To use the script, the `input_file` and `output_file` variables need to be set to the file paths to process. After the script is executed, it will read the CSV file on the specified path, convert it to TSV format, and write the converted result into the TSV file on the specified path.
