It sounds like you're having some trouble installing the `python-docx` package. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you resolve the issue:

### 1. **Ensure Python is Installed and Accessible:**
   - You mentioned that you have installed Python 3.4 and Python 3.2 on your Windows 10 system, as well as WinPython. Make sure that the Python executable is added to your system's PATH environment variable. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.

### 2. **Using WinPython:**
   - **Open WinPython Command Prompt:**
     - Locate and open the "WinPython Command Prompt.exe" from your WinPython installation directory.
   
   - **Install `python-docx` via pip:**
     - In the opened console, type the following command:
       ```sh
       pip install python-docx
       ```
     - If this fails due to a missing dependency (e.g., `lxml`), you can try installing `lxml` first:
       ```sh
       pip install lxml
       ```

### 3. **Handling `tar.gz` File Issues:**
   - If you encounter issues with `tar.gz` files, it might be because the package is not compatible with the version of Python you are using or there is a problem with the package itself. Ensure that you are using the correct version of `pip` for your Python installation.

### 4. **Check for Multiple Python Versions:**
   - Since you have multiple versions of Python installed, make sure you are using the correct `pip` for the Python version you want to use. For example, if you want to use Python 3.4, you should use `pip3.4`:
     ```sh
     pip3.4 install python-docx
     ```

### 5. **Verify Installation:**
   - After installation, you can verify that `python-docx` is installed correctly by running the following Python code:
     ```python
     import docx
     print(docx.__version__)
     ```
   - This should print the version of `python-docx` if it is installed successfully.

### 6. **Additional Tips:**
   - If you continue to face issues, consider creating a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies. This can help avoid conflicts between different packages and Python versions.
     - To create a virtual environment, you can use `venv`:
       ```sh
       python -m venv myenv
       ```
     - Activate the virtual environment:
       - On Windows:
         ```sh
         myenv\Scripts\activate
         ```
       - Then install `python-docx` within the virtual environment:
         ```sh
         pip install python-docx
         ```

If you follow these steps, you should be able to install `python-docx` without any issues. If you still encounter problems, please provide the exact error messages, and I can help further.
