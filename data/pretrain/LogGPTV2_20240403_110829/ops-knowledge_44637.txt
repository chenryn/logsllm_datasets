User: Suppose you need to provide more server resources during a peak period, but it cannot affect the normal operation of other applications. Please provide an elastic scaling solution.
Assistant: One elastic scaling solution is to use the automatic scaling function of the cloud computing service provider. Deploy the application on the virtual machine instance using the cloud computing service provider, set automatic scaling rules, and when the application needs more server resources, it will automatically trigger the start of a new virtual machine instance to provide more computing resources. When additional computing resources are not needed, automatically scale down the number of virtual machine instances to reduce costs and keep other applications running. In addition, containerized deployment can also be adopted, using container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to distribute applications on multiple nodes, and increase or decrease the number of nodes through automatic scaling strategies. Under this scheme, for peak traffic, you can add more nodes to process requests, and then reduce the number of nodes when the traffic drops to save costs.
