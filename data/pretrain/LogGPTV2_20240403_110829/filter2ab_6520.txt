**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Confluence

Adversaries may exploit Confluence repositories to extract valuable information. Confluence, often used in conjunction with Atlassian JIRA in development environments, is primarily designed for storing development-related documentation. However, it can also contain a wide range of other useful information, including:

- Project plans and roadmaps
- Internal policies and procedures
- Technical specifications and design documents
- Meeting notes and team collaboration records
- User guides and training materials
- Sensitive business and operational data

By accessing these repositories, adversaries can gain insights into an organization's internal processes, intellectual property, and strategic initiatives, which can be leveraged for further attacks or espionage.
