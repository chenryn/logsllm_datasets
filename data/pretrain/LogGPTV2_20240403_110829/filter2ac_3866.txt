**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Cron

Adversaries may exploit the cron utility to schedule tasks for the initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Cron is a time-based job scheduler commonly used in Unix-like operating systems. The crontab (cron table) file contains the schedule of cron jobs, specifying the times at which these jobs should be executed. Crontab files are stored in specific file paths that vary depending on the operating system.
