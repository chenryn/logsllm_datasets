ABSTRACT
Scalability remains one of the biggest challenges to the adoption of
permissioned blockchain technologies for large-scale deployments.
Namely, permissioned blockchains typically exhibit low latencies,
compared to permissionless deployments—however at the cost of
poor scalability. As a remedy, various solutions were proposed
to capture “the best of both worlds”, targeting low latency and
high scalability simultaneously. Among these, blockchain sharding
emerges as the most prominent technique. Most existing shard-
ing proposals exploit features of the permissionless model and are
therefore restricted to cryptocurrency applications. A few permis-
sioned sharding proposals exist, however, they either make strong
trust assumptions on the number of faulty nodes or rely on trusted
hardware or assume a static participation model where all nodes
are expected to be available all the time. In practice, nodes may join
and leave the system dynamically, which makes it challenging to
establish how to shard and when.
In this work, we address this problem and present Mitosis, a
novel approach to practically improve scalability of permissioned
blockchains. Our system allows the dynamic creation of blockchains,
as more participants join the system, to meet practical scalabil-
ity requirements. Crucially, it enables the division of an existing
blockchain (and its participants) into two—reminiscent of mito-
sis, the biological process of cell division. Mitosis inherits the low
latency of permissioned blockchains while preserving high through-
put via parallel processing. Newly created chains in our system
are fully autonomous, can choose their own consensus protocol,
and yet they can interact with each other to share information
and assets—meeting high levels of interoperability. We analyse the
security of Mitosis and evaluate experimentally the performance
of our solution when instantiated over Hyperledger Fabric. Our re-
sults show that Mitosis can be ported with little modifications and
manageable overhead to existing permissioned blockchains, such as
Hyperledger Fabric. As far as we are aware, Mitosis emerges as the

1 INTRODUCTION
Blockchains and decentralized applications thereof are evolving
rapidly. The initial wave of interest in cryptocurrencies, initiated
with Bitcoin [14], envisioned permissionless blockchains as an ideal
solution to realize trustless payments over the Internet, allowing
peers to exchange assets without the intermediation of financial
institutions. Despite the initial fame, Bitcoin and follow-up permis-
sionless systems have been found to suffer a number of shortcom-
ings [9], precluding their adoption for real-world applications. A
major obstacle to their widespread adoption is rooted in their prob-
abilistic consistency and liveness guarantees, offering a rather weak
notion of “eventual consensus”. Concretely, although blocks are gen-
erated at a regular pace, the blockchain nodes cannot be certain that
these blocks are stable in the ledger—they can only become more
confident that a given block will not be reverted as more blocks
are added “on top” of it. Probabilistic finality of blocks directly re-
flects on the ledger in terms of transaction-confirmation time. This
means that transactions cannot be confirmed with certainty, and
after being included to the ledger, high-confidence confirmation is
possible only once they are deep enough in the blockchain. Since
confirmation time is slow, latency and throughput of permission-
less systems are extremely limited compared to that of classical
consensus protocols. In contrast, permissioned blockchains provide
finality, meaning that once a block is included to the blockchain,
it is already final (i.e., no rollback will be possible later on). This

makes permissioned blockchains an attractive, faster alternative to
permissionless solutions, particularly for realistic deployments. It
is no surprise that prominent financial institutions are exploring
permissioned blockchains to improve their services and modern-
ize their businesses [6], and legal aspects of cryptocurrencies are
being discussed [19]. On the downside, permissioned-based con-
sensus protocols scale rather poorly in the number of consensus
nodes, which limits their deployment to small- and medium-scale
scenarios.
Major efforts in the blockchain space have been devoted to im-
proving scalability, with blockchain sharding being the most promi-
nent proposal. Blockchain sharding refers to the generic paradigm
of employing multiple blockchains in parallel, the “shards”, operat-
ing different and more lightweight instances of the same consensus
protocol. The idea is that running parallel instances allows boost-
ing the transaction throughput roughly by a factor equal to the
number of shards. Notwithstanding the efficiency gain, popular
solutions (such as Elastico [13], Omniledger [10], RapidChain [25],
and Monoxide [23]) can hardly meet both scalability and security
requirements [3]. In fact, most sharding proposals are designed
for, and exploit features of, the permissionless model, which con-
siderably restricts their practical suitability to cryptocurrency ap-
plications. To the best of our knowledge, all sharding proposals
assume a static participation model, meaning that all participating
nodes (precisely, the correct ones) must be available all the time.
This allows establishing upfront how many shards can be run in
parallel, depending on the number of participants. Given that par-
ticipation in blockchain systems can change dynamically, we argue
instead that new shards have to be created ad-hoc. Finally, we note
that existing sharding techniques assume homogenous blockchains
running the same consensus protocol; for practical deployments,
however, different shards might benefit from choosing their own
consensus protocol independently of other shards.
In this work, we propose a novel approach for improving scala-
bility of permissioned blockchains. Inspired by the sharding para-
digm and mindful of its limitations, we seek to leverage parallelism
in a way that offers flexibility. Namely, we envision a dynamic
blockchain ecosystem where new blockchains can be created as
the need arises, and can evolve over time to meet specific scala-
bility requirements. In contrast to sharding, where all blockchain
instances are highly coordinated and obey the same consensus, our
solution lets the various blockchains in the system self-organize, in
a decentralized manner, depending on their needs.
Our solution is inspired by mitosis, the cell division process in
biology in which a parent cell divides into two or more child cells:
we propose a novel mechanism, dubbed Mitosis, to practically give
birth to new blockchains by splitting an existing one. Based on
this intuitive approach to create new blockchains, we investigate
the necessary conditions so that the chain-splitting process can be
operated securely. Particularly, we analyse how trust assumptions
on the parent chain impact the security of the child chains, and
identify sufficient requirements on the parent chain, in terms of
tolerated faults, to ensure consistency and liveness for both child
chains despite crash- or Byzantine failures, thereby enabling to
bootstrap trust from the parent chain to its child chains.
Mitosis leverages parallelism in order to scale permissioned
blockchains with dynamic membership (i.e., where new users can
join at any time), as it allows increasing the number of system
participants arbitrarily while preserving the high throughput of
a small-scale system. Moreover, Mitosis enables different block-
chains to communicate with each other, meeting high standards
for blockchain interoperability. This means that users belonging to
different blockchains can easily interact, e.g., to transfer assets from
one blockchain to another. Our design particularly supports knowl-
edge transfer and asset transfer across blockchains [26], thereby
letting users prove statements about the state of their chain to
users of different chains, as well as to move asset from one chain
to another. Our system also offers a chain-fusion procedure that,
opposite to division, combines two blockchains into one (as in the
fusion of cells), in case some of the blockchains significantly shrink
in size.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We present Mitosis, a methodology to create new blockchains
by recursively splitting an existing system into two child
systems. We employ Mitosis to develop a flexible permis-
sioned blockchain ecosystem for large-scale deployment, in
which blockchains can self-organize to keep the system scal-
able and functional. Based on its increased dynamism, our
solution improves upon sharding and is in fact compatible
with existing schemes supporting sharding, by additionally
allowing the dynamic creation of heterogeneous shards.
• We analyse the security requirements for blockchain split-
ting, particularly in terms of tolerated faults, and we discuss
techniques to instantiate chain division such that the robust-
ness requirements are met.
• We show how to integrate our proposal in Hyperledger Fab-
ric which only supports homogenous shards (with no com-
munication between shards).
As far as we are aware, Mitosis is the first complete and practical
blockchain system which securely enables the creation of new
blockchains as the need arises, and allows them to evolve over time
to meet specific scalability requirements. We believe that such a
model fits very well with the current deployments of permissioned
blockchains, such as Hyperledger Fabric, as it enables the creation of
a flexible, scalable, and secure system for permissioned blockchains.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2
we discuss the problem statement in detail. We present our solution
in Section 3, and analyse its security in Section 4. In Section 5
we discuss a practical instantiation of our blockchain ecosystem
based on Hyperledger Fabric. We discuss implementation details
in Section 6, and we report on the performance of our Mitosis
instantiation based on an empirical evaluation. We conclude the
paper in Section 7.
