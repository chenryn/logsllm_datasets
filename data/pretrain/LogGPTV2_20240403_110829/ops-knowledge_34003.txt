User: Supposedly Python 2.7 is included native to OSX 10.8 and above (if I remember correctly), but I recently installed Python 3.5 to use for projects while I work through UDacity. Lo and behold, the UDacity courses seem to use 2.7 - wups! So instead of trying to uninstall 3.5 (this procedure seemed to scary for neophytes such as myself), I simply installed 2.7 in addition to the recently installed 3.5 and just run the 2.7 IDLE and Shell. Is this ok, or will I run into problems down the road?
Assistant: As others have said, if the installation directory is different it should be no problem at all.
One thing that'll make your life easier for switching between the two is to use an IDE such as PyCharm, you just have to change a drop down to switch between the two versions.
