### RRC States in Various Inter-System Switching Options

**Figure 6: RRC states in various inter-system switching options.**

However, this inter-system switching cannot be activated (the property `MM_OK` is violated). We have two key observations:
1. There is an ongoing PS data session since the PDP context is active.
2. The 3G RRC state is either FACH or DCH (i.e., CONNECTED).

The root cause lies in the RRC protocol, which regulates both the CS domain and the PS domain during inter-system switching between 3G and 4G. Figure 6(a) illustrates RRC transitions in three inter-system switching options:

1. **RRC Connection Release with Redirect**: This option starts with a non-IDLE RRC state and forces an RRC connection release before inter-system switching. It migrates the device back to 4G but disrupts the ongoing high-rate data session.
2. **Inter-System Handover**: This supports direct transition between 3G DCH and 4G CONNECTED. It mitigates interruption of the data session but incurs operational overhead for carriers (e.g., buffering and relaying packets during the handover).
3. **Inter-System Cell Selection**: This works for the RRC IDLE state and is triggered by the mobile device to look for better 3G/4G cells for subsequent switching.

The standard gives carriers the freedom to choose these switching options. However, the state transition for inter-system switching has design defects. Figure 6(b) shows the simplified RRC state transition in the CSFB case. When the CSFB call starts, the RRC state migrates from 4G to 3G DCH (Step 1) due to the high-rate data service. After the CSFB call in the 3G CS domain completes, the RRC remains at the DCH state because the high-rate data is still ongoing. If the inter-system cell selection option is chosen by operators, the device gets stuck in 3G. 

The RRC state is determined by both CS-domain voice and PS-domain data. Although the PS and CS domains do not interact directly, both rely on RRC for control and share the same RRC state. This indicates that signaling interaction between CS and PS domains is managed through the RRC protocol. Cross-domain signaling is necessary because the CS and PS domains are interdependent. As long as the CS-based call is ongoing, the data session in the PS domain must stay in 3G and can only move to 4G after the call terminates.

Carriers should not be held responsible for the deadlock, as they follow the standards. It is understandable for carriers to use "inter-system cell selection" to switch back to 4G after the CSFB call ends. This reduces network loading by offloading the monitoring and response to each CSFB call state to the mobile device and does not interrupt current data sessions. However, the fundamental problem is that the 3G/4G standards fail to design a robust RRC protocol that can handle all cross-domain, cross-system scenarios.

### Experimental Validation

We initiated a 60-minute UDP uplink/downlink data session at a high rate (200 kbps) in both OP-I and OP-II. A CSFB call was made from the LTE phone and hung up after the call started. We confirmed that the RRC state at the phone remained at DCH after the call was hung up. In OP-I, the phone switched to 4G within a few seconds using the RRC Connection Release and Redirect option, disrupting its data session. In OP-II, the device got stuck in 3G, consistent with the duration of the data sessions (about 60 minutes in our experiments).

### Table 4: Scenarios Triggering Location/Routing Area Update

| No | Scenario | Category |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Periodic location update | Location area updating |
| 2 | Cross location area | Location area updating |
| 3 | CSFB call ends | Location area updating |
| 4 | Cross routing area | Routing area updating |
| 5 | Periodic routing update | Routing area updating |
| 6 | Switch to 3G system | Location and routing area updating |

**Insight 3:** Well-designed features can become error-prone as new functions are enabled. Design options should be prudently justified, tested, and regulated. Otherwise, the desirable benefits may be compromised by various unregulated option choices.

### Problematic Coupled Actions

#### 6.1 HOL Blocking for Independent Updates

**Instance S4:** Unnecessary coupling between cross-layer protocols in 3G. Both voice and data services may suffer from Head of Line (HOL) blocking and thus extra latency due to independent, yet unnecessarily prioritized location updates at underlying layers. The involved protocols are CM/MM for the CS domain and SM/GMM for the PS domain.

**6.1.1 Issues and Root Causes**

The network needs to know the location of the device to route incoming calls. Table 4 lists various usage scenarios that trigger location updates. In the 3G CS domain, the location update is initiated by the MM protocol on the user device and sent to the MSC. In the 3G PS domain, the location update is performed by GMM via a routing area update, and the 3G gateway is responsible for accepting or rejecting it.

CNetVerifier reports that outgoing CS/PS service requests from the CM/SM layer can be delayed while the MM/GMM layer is performing a location/routing area update. In the CS domain, when an outgoing call is initiated and CM sends the request to MM, the CM service request is delayed (or even rejected based on the standards [6]) if MM is running the location update. Similar results are observed in the PS domain with GMM and SM.

At first glance, this decision seems reasonable. Two requests are waiting to be served: one is the CS/PS service request at CM/SM, and the other is the location update request at MM/GMM. The service request should be deferred to yield to the location update. Without correct location information, the device is not reachable by others, so location updates should be processed with high priority.

However, this is not well-founded. Note that the call/data request is outbound, and the device can always send it out. If the call request is served first, the MSC also implicitly updates the location for the device as a byproduct of call serving. Therefore, inbound services are not affected by whether the location update request or the call request is served first. There is no need to expedite the location update request. Implicit updates can be realized without any extra resources. The service requests on upper-layer CM/SM protocols are independent of the location updates at lower-layer MM/GMM. Artificially correlating and prioritizing them incurs unnecessary latency to user service requests.

**6.1.2 Experimental Validation**

**Call Service:**
In the experiment, the caller repeatedly dialed the callee and immediately dialed again once the callee hung up. This was done while driving along two routes: Route-1 (15-mile freeway) and Route-2 (28.3-mile freeway+local), in both OP-I and OP-II. The observed phenomenon was similar between carriers and across test runs. Results are shown for OP-I. Indeed, phones delayed the call request until the location update was completed. Figure 7 plots the call setup time on Route-1 (from dialing to connected call) and the measured signal strength (RSSI). The average setup time was around 11.4 seconds, and RSSI varied within the good-signal range [-51dBm, -95dBm]. Two location updates were observed at 9.5 miles (RSSI: -73dBm) and 13.2 miles (RSSI: -87dBm). When the call was initiated during a location update, the call setup time increased to 19.7 seconds, about 8.3 seconds longer than the average. Since the measured RSSI was strong, the extra time was attributed to the location update. Figure 8(a) plots the CDF of duration for location area update. In OP-I, all updates took longer than 2 seconds, with an average of about 3 seconds. In OP-II, 72% of routing area updates took 1.2–2.1 seconds, with an average of 1.9 seconds.

A chain effect for delayed call services was also observed. Call requests were delayed for 8.3 seconds, whereas location updates took 4 seconds. The extra 4.3-second gap was incurred by MM while processing both cross-layer MM and RRC-related commands in the state “MM-WAIT-FOR-NET-CMD” [6] after the location update. In this state, all call requests were unnecessarily delayed until new commands from the network arrived.

**Internet Data Service:**
In this test, we first turned on the data service and transferred data packets to an Internet server, then disabled the PS service. Our experiments showed that SM data requests were not immediately processed during the routing area update. Figure 8(b) plots the CDF of duration for routing area update. In OP-I, around 75% of updates took 1-3.6 seconds. In OP-II, 90% of routing area updates took 1.6 to 4.1 seconds. Therefore, the impact of routing area update in the PS domain was slightly smaller than the location update in the CS domain. This is because GMM does not process RRC-related functions, whereas MM does. However, routing area updates are more frequent than location updates, making users more likely to experience delayed data service than a deferred outgoing call.

**Insight 4:** Some procedures in upper and lower layers seem independent but are coupled by their execution order. Without prudent design, HOL blocking may occur.
