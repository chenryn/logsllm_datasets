Figure 6: RRC states in various inter-system switching options.
However, this inter-system switching cannot be activated (the prop-
erty MM_OK is violated). We have two observations. First, there is
an ongoing PS data session since the PDP context is active. Second,
the 3G RRC state is at either FACH or DCH (i.e., CONNECTED).
The root cause lies in the RRC protocol, which regulates both the
CS domain and the PS domain during the inter-system switching
between 3G and 4G. Figure 6(a) illustrates RRC transitions in three
inter-system switching options. The ﬁrst option, “RRC connection
release with redirect”, starts with RRC non-IDLE state and forces
an RRC connection release before the inter-system switching. It
migrates the device back to 4G but disrupts the ongoing high-rate
data session. Second, an inter-system handover is invoked. It sup-
ports the direct transition between 3G DCH and 4G CONNECTED. It
mitigates interruption of data session but incurs operation overhead
for carriers (e.g., buffering and relaying packets during the han-
dover). The third option is “inter-system cell selection”. It works
for RRC IDLE state and it is triggered by the mobile device to look
for better 3G/4G cells for subsequent switching.
The standard gives the carriers freedom to choose these switch-
ing options. However, the state transition for inter-system switch-
ing has design defects. Figure 6(b) shows the simpliﬁed RRC state
transition in this CSFB case. When the CSFB call starts, the RRC
state migrates from 4G to 3G DCH (Step 1) due to the high-rate
data service. When the CSFB call in the 3G CS domain completes,
RRC remains at the DCH state since the high-rate data is still on-
going. It is stuck in 3G if inter-system cell selection option is se-
lected by operators. We see that the RRC state is determined by
both CS-domain voice and PS-domain data. Although PS and CS
domains do not interact directly, both domains rely on RRC for
control. They share the same RRC state. This shows that, signaling
interaction between CS and PS domains is done through the RRC
protocol. The cross-domain signaling is needed because CS and PS
domains are dependent. As long as the CS-based call is ongoing,
data session in the PS domain has to stay in 3G. It may move to 4G
only after the call terminates.
Carriers should not be held responsible for the deadlock. They
do follow the standards.
It is understandable for carriers to use
“inter-system cell selection” to switch back to 4G after the CSFB
call ends. First, it reduces the network loading to monitor and re-
spond to each CSFB call state, since it is triggered by mobile de-
vice. Second, it does not interrupt current data sessions. However,
the fundamental problem is that, 3G/4G standards fail to design the
bullet-proof RRC protocol, which should handle all cross-domain,
cross-system scenarios.
5.3.2 Experimental Validation
We start a 60-min UDP uplink/downlink data session at high rate
(200kbps) in both OP-I and OP-II. We make a CSFB call from the
LTE phone and hang it upon after the call starts. We conﬁrm that
the RRC state at the phone remains at DCH after the call hangs up.
In OP-I, the phone switches to 4G in a few seconds through the
option of RRC Connection Release and Redirect. Its data session
is disrupted. In OP-II, the device gets stuck in 3G. It is the same as
the duration of data sessions (about 60 minutes in our experiments).

Insight 3: The original well-designed features can become error-
prone as new functions are enabled. Design options should be pru-
dently justiﬁed, tested and regulated. Otherwise, the desirable ben-
eﬁt may be compromised by various unregulated option choices.
6. PROBLEMATIC COUPLED ACTIONS
We now report three problematic coupling instances, discuss the
root causes, and evaluate their impact on users.
6.1 HOL Blocking for Independent Updates
The instance S4 is on unnecessary coupling between cross-layer
protocols in 3G. Both voice and data services may suffer from Head
of Line (HOL) Blocking and thus extra latency due to independent,
yet unnecessarily prioritized location update at underlaying layers.
The involved protocols are CM/MM and SM/GMM for the CS do-
main and the PS domain, respectively.
6.1.1
Issues and Root Causes
The network needs to know the location of the device. Without
it, the network cannot route incoming calls to the user. Table 4 lists
various usage scenarios that may trigger location update. This up-
date is performed for roaming users, and it is also used for periodic
refresh without mobility or after inter-system switching. In 3G CS
domain, the location update is initiated by MM protocol on user
device, and sent to MSC. In 3G PS domain, the location update is
performed by GMM via routing area update, and 3G gateway is
responsible for accepting/rejecting it.
CNetVeriﬁer reports that outgoing CS/PS service requests from
the CM/SM layer can be delayed while the MM/GMM layer is do-
ing location/routing area update.
In CS, the issue arises when an
outgoing call is initiated and CM sends the request5 to MM. How-
ever, the CM service request is delayed (or even rejected based on
the standards [6]) when MM is running the location update. Similar
results can be observed on the cross-layer interaction of GMM and
SM in the PS domain. Note that both the outgoing call request and
the location update are initiated by the user device in S4 here.
At ﬁrst sight, the above decision seems to be plausible. Two
requests are waiting to be served. One is the CS/PS service re-
quest at CM/SM, while the other is the location update request at
MM/GMM. The service request should be deferred and yield to the
location update. Without correct location information updated at
the network, the device is not reachable by others. Location up-
dates should be processed with high priority.
However, this is not well grounded. Note that the call/data re-
quest is outbound. The device can always send it out. If this call
request is served ﬁrst, MSC also implicitly updates the location for
the device as a byproduct of call serving. Therefore, inbound ser-
vices are not affected by whether the location update request or
the call request is served ﬁrst. There is no need to serve the loca-
tion update request in the expedited manner. Implicit update can
be realized without any extra resource. The service requests on
upper-layer CM/SM protocols are independent of the location up-
dates at lower-layer MM/GMM. Artiﬁcially correlating and priori-
tizing them incur unnecessary latency to user service requests.

and MSC for call setup.

6.1.2 Experimental Validation
Call service.
In the experiment, the caller repeatedly dials the
callee, and immediately dials again once the callee hangs up. It is
done when we drive along two routes: Route-1 (15-mile freeway)
and Route-2 (28.3-mile freeway+local), in both OP-I and OP-II.
The observed phenomenon is similar between carriers and across
test runs. We show results in OP-I only. We indeed see that phones
delay the call request until location update is completed. Figure 7
plots the call setup time on Route-1 (i.e., from dialing to connected
call) and the measured signal strength (RSSI). The average setup
time is around 11.4 seconds, and RSSI varies within the good-
signal range [-51dBm, -95dBm]. We observe two location updates
at two spots of the route, 9.5 mile (RSSI:-73dBm) and 13.2 mile
(RSSI:-87dBm). When the call is initiated during location update,
the call setup time increases to 19.7 seconds, about 8.3 seconds
longer than the average. Since the measured RSSI is strong, we in-
fer that the extra time is caused by the location update. Figure 8(a)
plots the CDF of duration for location area update.
In OP-I, all
updates take longer than 2 seconds, and the average is about 3 sec-
onds. In OP-II, 72% of routing area updates take 1.2–2.1 seconds,
and the average is 1.9 seconds.
We also notice a chain effect for delayed call services. The call
requests are delayed for 8.3 seconds, whereas location update takes
4 seconds. It turns out, the extra 4.3 second gap is incurred by MM
while it process both cross-layer MM and RRC related commands
in the state “MM-WAIT-FOR-NET-CMD” [6] after the location up-
date. In this state, all the call requests will be unnecessarily delayed
until new commands from network arrive.
Internet data service.
In this test, we ﬁrst turn on the data ser-
vice and transfer data packets to an Internet server, and then disable
the PS service. Our experiments show that, the SM data requests
are not immediately processed during the routing area update. Fig-
ure 8(b) plots the CDF of duration for routing area update. In OP-I,
around 75% of updates take 1-3.6 seconds. In OP-II, 90% of rout-
ing area updates take from 1.6 seconds to 4.1 seconds. Therefore,
the impact of routing area update in the PS domain is a little bit
smaller than location update in the CS domain. This is because
GMM does not process RRC related functions, whereas MM has
to. However, routing area update is performed more frequently than
location update. The user is more likely to experience delayed data
service than a deferred outgoing call.
Insight 4: Some procedures in upper and lower layers seem inde-
pendent but are coupled by their execution order. Without prudent
design, HOL blocking may happen.
