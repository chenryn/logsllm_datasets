Question: "You are reviewing the security design of an upcoming System-on-Chip (SoC) product that features a secure boot process. The design includes a mechanism that uses hardware fuses for in-field patching of ROM code vulnerabilities. What is a potential limitation of this approach that you should consider in your analysis?"
 "A": "The hardware fuses may introduce additional vulnerabilities during the manufacturing process that can be exploited once the product is deployed."
 "B": "Patches applied through hardware fuses might have restrictions in terms of size and the number of patches that can be supported."
 "C": "The use of hardware fuses for patching could significantly increase the boot time of the SoC, leading to performance degradation."
 "D": "Implementing hardware fuses can cause compatibility issues with certain types of memory used in the SoC, limiting the device's market applicability."
Answer: B
