I find when I'm reading the documentation that I have to do a shit ton of
scrolling so I can get to the primary navigation after I've made my way so far
down the page. A back to top link would seriously save me time and a some
finger abrasion. The mighty mouse and touch pads aren't exactly free spinning
scroll wheel machines.
If I try really hard the best I can get from the bottom of the component's
page to the top is 11 scroll movements...
