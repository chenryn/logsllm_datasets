# Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement
After completing the update, `explorer.exe` may close unexpectedly.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)
To address this issue, we propose adding a popup warning before the installation begins. The warning will inform the user that `explorer.exe` will be restarted as part of the update process. Additionally, the popup will provide an option to cancel the installation to avoid the closure of `explorer.exe`.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Popup Warning:**
   - Display a message box with the following text: "The update will restart `explorer.exe`. Do you want to continue?"
   - Include two buttons: "Continue" and "Cancel."

2. **User Interaction:**
   - If the user selects "Continue," the update will proceed as normal.
   - If the user selects "Cancel," the update process will be terminated, and `explorer.exe` will remain open.

This approach ensures that users are aware of the potential impact on their current session and can make an informed decision.
