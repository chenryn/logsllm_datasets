Who Am I?
First, The Kaminsky Problem
● At multiple cons, over multiple years, speaking 
in opposite rooms
● Getting rather ridiculous
● I have yet to see any of his talks live
● Summed up as the “RenderMan Birthday 
Paradox” on his blog
● Ironic since yesterday (27th) was my birthday
● Can someone confirm if they are schedualing 
this intentionally!
Ass Covering
● For the love of Spongebob, do not actually try 
any of the ideas in this talk outside of a lab!!!
● We are talking about commercial airliners and 
peoples lives here; serious stuff
● Use this information to make air travel safer
● Think about how this happened and make sure 
future systems are built secure from the start
● Hackers need to be included in more areas 
than we are now 
Ass Covering
● I Want To Be Wrong!; If I am wrong about something, 
call me on it, publicly!
● I am not a pilot, ATC operator, or in any way associated 
with the airline industry or aviation beyond flying cattle 
class. A Lot!
● I may have some details or acronyms wrong, I 
apologize, feel free to correct me
● This research is ongoing and too important to keep 
hidden until completion
● I want to prove to myself this is safe, so far I've failed, 
so I need your help
It All Started With An App
● I got interested purely by 
accident
● Bought Planefinder AR in 
October 2010
● Overlays flight information 
through camera
● GPS location + Direction + 
web lookup of flights
● This is cool, how does it 
work?
Planefinders
● Planefinder.net, Flightradar24.com, Radarvirtuel.com
● Aggregates data from all over the world
● User provided ground stations and data
● Generates near real time (~10 min delay) Google Map of 
air traffic
● Supports queries for Airlines, cities, tail numbers, flight 
numbers, etc
● Lots of interesting info
● Also contained info on how the site and App worked
It Went Downhill From There
● Been under-employed 
for over a year
● When I get bored, bad 
things happen
● I still fly to a lot of 
speaking gigs
● Started thinking about 
airplane tracking
● This is why I should 
always be employed
Current Air Traffic Control
● Has not changed much since 
1970's
● Primary radar provides range 
and bearing, no elevation
● Transponder system (SSR) 
queries the plane, plane 
responds with a 4-digit 
identifier + elevation
● ID number attached to flight 
on radar scope, great deal of 
manual communication and 
work required
Current Air Traffic Control
● Transponder ID used to communicate situations 
i.e. emergencies, hijacking, etc
● Transponder provides a higher power return 
than primary radar reflection, longer range
● Only interrogated every 6-12 seconds, low 
resolution of altitude
● Pilots get no benefit (traffic, etc)
● Requires large separation of planes (~80miles) 
which limits traffic throughput in busy areas 
Current Air Traffic Control
● IVR flights are way point 
based, not optimal or direct 
path
● Air travel is increasing, 
capacity is limited
● Weather and other events 
(i.e. Volcano's) can cause 
havoc around the world
● Something needed to 
change
Nextgen Air Traffic Control
● Late 90's FAA initiative to revamp the ATC 
system in the US, and via ICAO, the world
● Do more with less
● Modernize the ATC system over approximately 
20 years
● Save costs on ATC equipment, save fuel, save 
time, increase capacity
● ADS-B is the key feature, the datasource for 
Planefinder sites and the focus of this talk  
ADS-B
● Automatic Dependant Surveillance Broadcast
● Planes use GPS to determine their position, broadcast over 
1090Mhz (978Mhz for GA) at 1Hz
● Contains Aircraft ID, altitude, position lat/lon, bearing, speed
● Recieved by a network of groundstations
● Particularly useful over radar 'dead zones', i.e. mountainous 
regions, Oceans, Hudsons Bay, Gulf of Mexico, Alaskan 
mountains
● Certainty of location allows for flights to be closer (5 miles)
● Two forms: ADS-B Out and ADS-B In
ADS-B Out
Looks a lot like any other network packet doesn't it?
ADS-B Out
● No interrogation needed (Automatic)
● Instead of primary/secondary radar, planes 
report their location from GPS (Dependant)
● Sent omni-directionally to ground stations and 
other aircraft (Broadcast)
● ATC's scope is populated from received signals
● Uses1090Mhz for commercial (big stuff), 
978Mhz for General aviation (small stuff) 
ADS-B In
● ADS-B IN: Optional equipment can be installed in aircraft to 
listen to ADS-B out from planes and ATC
● Allows planes to be aware of each other without ATC 
intervention (TIS-B)
● Also allows for real time weather data (FIS-B)
● Situational awareness increases dramatically, allows more 
flights operate simultaneously
● Also works for ground equipment and taxiing aircraft
● Expensive!!  $5-10K for ADS-B out, $20K for ADS-B In
● GA market getting cheaper though
● Not a lot of used market yet (problem for researchers)
Planefinder.net
(London, 7/11/12)
Scary Stuff
● The hacker side of my brain took over
● Started to investigate how this worked and what 
measures may be in use to mitigate threats
● Could not immediately find answers (trust us!)
● Previous experience shows no answer usually 
means hadn't thought of it, or have thought of it, 
but too late, lets hide the answer
● Started digging deeper and found I'm not the 
only one
And Now The Scary Part
● ADS-B is unencrypted and unauthenticated
● Anyone can listen to 1090Mhz and decode the 
transmissions from aircraft in real time
● Simple Pulse Per Second modulated
● No data level authentication of data from aircraft, just 
simple checksums
● Some correlation of primary radar sighting to received 
data (changing to Multilateration, More on that later)
● I am running a ground station at home, monitoring all 
traffic in and out of Edmonton
Others
● Others have begun to look and to question
● Righter Kunkel, Defcon 18
● Balint Seeber, spench.net – SDR research
● USAF Major Donald L. McCallie – Graduate 
research project
● Nick Foster – SDR and radio enthusiast
● No one has come up with solid security 
answers in several years of research
Why This Matters
● Largely a N. America problem but being utilized 
all over the world, adopted wider yearly
● UPS equipped all of their fleet
● ADS-B equipped planes are in the air over your 
head right now
● The inevitable direction of ATC for the next 
couple decades
● I fly a lot and want to get home from here safely
● A multitude of threat vectors to look at
ADS-B Out Threat #1
● Eavesdropping: Easily capture cleartext 
data of air traffic
● Data mining potential; We know whats in 
the air and when
● See the talk after mine: Busting the BARR: 
Tracking “Untrackable” Private Aircraft for 
Fun & Profit
● They will go more into it
ADS-B Out Threat #2
● Injection: Inject 'ghost' flights into ATC systems
● Documents that discuss fusing ADS-B with primary radar, also 
discusses discontinuing primary radar
● Introduce slight variations in real flights
● Generally cause confusion at inopportune moments (weather, 
Holidays, major travel hubs, Olympics)
● Create regular false flights, train the system (smugglers)
● Some documentation discussing Multilateration, nothing denoting 
its manditory use
ADS-B Out Threat #3
● Jamming: Outright Jam ATC reception of ADS-B 
signals
● Could be detected and DF'd quickly, but are 
facilities available for that?
● Proper target location and timing could cause 
mass chaos (London Olympics?)
● Co-ordinated jamming across many travel hubs? 
Accidental or intentional?
● Simple frequency congestion already a problem, 
no contention protocol
ADS-B In Threat #1
● Injection: Inject data into aircraft ADS-B In 
displays
● Inject confusing, impossible, scary types of 
traffic to illicit a response
● Introduce conflicting data between ATC and 
cockpit displays
● Autopilot systems using ADS-B In data for 
collision avoidance?
● Aircraft have no source for multilateration
ADS-B In Threat #2
● GPS Jamming: Block planes ability to use GPS
● North Korea currently jamming GPS along border
● UK tests found widespread use along highways
● Newark airport caused grief daily by truck 
mounted jammer
● ~$20-30 on Dealextreme.com
● Easily tucked into baggage on a timer
● Removes ADS-B advantages
ADS-B In Threat #3
● GPS Spoofing: Introduce manipulated signal to 
generate false lat/lon reading
● Aircraft location no longer reliable
● Best case, fall back to traditional navigation
● Worst case, remote steering of aircraft
● Iran may have used this technique to capture 
US drone
● Already shown to be able to screw with US 
drones recently (sub ~$1000)
ADS-B Unknown Threats
● Some threats are total unknowns.  The ATC system is 
huge and hard to parse from public docs
● What about injecting data for a flight on the west coast, 
into a ground station on the east coast?
● Has anyone fuzzed a 747 or a control tower? Buffer 
overflow at 36,000 feet?
● Look into Chris Roberts of One World Labs work on 
embedded control systems on planes, ships, cars, etc.  
Mix in ADS-B.....Scary stuff.
● Verification of ADS-B chip level code.  Could be used 
as a control channel?
ADS-B Threat Mitigations?
● You hope that the engineers, FAA, DHS, everyone 
else looked at these threats
● FAA submitted ADS-B to NIST for Security 
Certification, but.....
● “ the FAA specifically assessed the vulnerability risk 
of ADS–B broadcast messages being used to target 
air carrier aircraft. This assessment contains 
Sensitive Security Information that is controlled 
under 49 CFR parts 1 and 1520, and its content is 
otherwise protected from public disclosure”
ADS-B Threat Mitigation
● It gets worse: “While the agency cannot 
comment on the data in this study, it can confirm, 
for the purpose of responding to the comments 
in this rulemaking proceeding, that using ADS–B 
data does not subject an aircraft to any 
increased risk compared to the risk that is 
experienced today” - Docket No. FAA–2007–29305; 
Amdt. No.91–314
● What threats are those?  Why not threats of 
tomorrow? Why not threats we have'nt thought 
of yet?
ADS-B Threat Mitigation
● Multilateration; time differential between signal 
reciving stations
● Provides corellation that ADS-B data matches 
signal source
● No indication this will be used everywhere
● What about if the data does'nt match?
● How does the ATC UI indicate a mismatch?
● Liability issues for ATC equipment vendors 
ignoring data?
ADS-B Threats
● Basically reponse is; “Trust Us”
● Second time I ran across this excuse. Last time was 
RFID passports (look how that turned out)
● I dont know about you, but I never trust anyone who says 
'Trust Me”
● Not trying to spew FUD, but to raise awareness and 
pressure to disclose more information about existing 
threat mitigation technology 
● Also want to see disclosure of procedures for 'weird crap'
● Hackers looking at ATC will get a response
ADS-B Threats 
● A common response will be 'It's too expensive 
for the common man”
● ~$20 USB TV tuner can be made into a 
software defined radio and used to receive 
ADS-B
● Helping Dragorn get cheap receivers working 
on Kismet and ADS-B support (wardriving for 
aircraft!)
ADS-B Threats
● Got word while in the air en route to Poland
● Nick Foster implemented ADS-B Out on Gnu 
Radio
● A synthetic report generated and decoded by 
the Gnuradio ADS-B receiver:  (-1 
0.0000000000) Type 17 subtype 05 (position 
report) from abcdef at (37.123444, 
-122.123439) (48.84 @ 154) at 30000ft
● Honeymoon is over, exploit #1 is here
ADS-B Out Gnu Radio
ADS-B Threats
● Nick Foster raised his game
● ADS-B In on Flightgear (OSS Flight sim) populates 
sim envirnoment with real planes
● ADS-B data generated by your virtual plane, fed into 
GNU radio and put out over the real air
● Your virtual world is now transmitting into the real 
world.  
● Output now pseudo-matches a real planes 
behaviour
● Flightgear also has an intercept course feature
ADS-B Threats
● Plan is to release the software
● Need to run past the EFF first to make sure we 
don't get shot, dissapeared, etc
● We have the capability to generate arbitrary 
packets, anyone else could easily do this
● All testing was at 900Mhz ISM band
● Easy to adjust for UAT ADS-B for GA
● The next guys might not be so nice
Other Threats
● Autopilot integration of ADS-B
● Collision avoidance systems
● Tailored approach (ATC upload landing plan to 
aircraft)
● Aircraft are huge, complex systems
● Reading on one system leads you to many 
others
Future
● ADS-B will be mandatory by 2020
● Europe delaying till 2030
● Already in use in N. America, Europe, China, Australia
● Even if not in use at airports, equipped planes are flying 
overhead
● Still time to develop countermeasures (don't turn off 
primary radar!)
● If you have a 747 or similar and/or an air traffic control 
tower that I can borrow for a while, please let me know

Conclusion
● This is pretty scary to consider
● How many people want to take the bus home?
● We should all be working on finding and solving 
problems like this
● If I can find this stuff, so can bad guys
● Significant investment has been made already
● I want to hear your comments and your ideas on 
further threats and research.  Lets work on this 
together!
