## The Kaminsky Problem
- At multiple conferences over the years, Dan Kaminsky and I have been scheduled to speak in opposite rooms.
- This has become rather ridiculous, as I have yet to see any of his talks live.
- This situation was summed up as the "RenderMan Birthday Paradox" on his blog, which is ironic since yesterday (the 27th) was my birthday.
- Is this scheduling intentional? If so, can someone confirm it?

## Ass Covering
- **Important Note:** Do not attempt any of the ideas discussed in this talk outside of a controlled lab environment. We are dealing with commercial airliners and human lives—serious stuff.
- Use this information to make air travel safer.
- Consider how these vulnerabilities occur and ensure future systems are built securely from the start.
- Hackers need to be more involved in various areas than we currently are.

- **Personal Disclaimer:**
  - I want to be proven wrong! If I am incorrect about something, please call me out publicly.
  - I am not a pilot, ATC operator, or associated with the airline industry beyond being a frequent flyer.
  - I may have some details or acronyms wrong; feel free to correct me.
  - This research is ongoing and too important to keep hidden until completion.
  - I want to prove that this is safe, but so far, I have failed. I need your help.

## It All Started With An App
- My interest began purely by accident when I bought Planefinder AR in October 2010.
- This app overlays flight information through the camera using GPS location, direction, and web lookups.
- I found it fascinating and wanted to understand how it works.

## Planefinders
- Websites like Planefinder.net, Flightradar24.com, and Radarvirtuel.com aggregate data from user-provided ground stations.
- They generate near real-time (~10 min delay) Google Maps of air traffic.
- These sites support queries for airlines, cities, tail numbers, flight numbers, etc., and provide a wealth of interesting information.

## It Went Downhill From There
- Being under-employed for over a year, I started thinking about airplane tracking.
- This is why I should always be employed—when I get bored, bad things happen.

## Current Air Traffic Control (ATC)
- The current ATC system has not changed much since the 1970s.
- Primary radar provides range and bearing but no elevation.
- The transponder system (SSR) queries the plane, which responds with a 4-digit identifier and elevation.
- Transponder IDs are used to communicate situations like emergencies and hijackings.
- Transponders provide a higher power return than primary radar, extending the range.
- Pilots receive no benefits from this system, such as traffic information.
- Large separation (about 80 miles) between planes is required, limiting traffic throughput in busy areas.

## Nextgen Air Traffic Control
- The FAA initiated a project in the late 1990s to modernize the ATC system over approximately 20 years.
- The goal is to do more with less, saving costs on ATC equipment, fuel, and time while increasing capacity.
- ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) is the key feature and the focus of this talk.

## ADS-B
- **Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B):**
  - Planes use GPS to determine their position and broadcast this information at 1Hz on 1090Mhz (978Mhz for general aviation).
  - Data includes aircraft ID, altitude, position, bearing, and speed.
  - Ground stations and other aircraft receive this data.
  - ADS-B is particularly useful in radar 'dead zones' like mountainous regions, oceans, and remote areas.
  - It allows for closer flights (5 miles apart) due to the certainty of location.
  - Two forms: ADS-B Out and ADS-B In.

### ADS-B Out
- **No Interrogation Needed (Automatic):** Planes report their location from GPS.
- **Omni-Directional Broadcast:** Sent to ground stations and other aircraft.
- **Populates ATC Scope:** Received signals populate the ATC scope.
- **Frequency:** 1090Mhz for commercial aircraft, 978Mhz for general aviation.

### ADS-B In
- **Optional Equipment:** Allows aircraft to listen to ADS-B Out from other planes and ATC.
- **Situational Awareness:** Increases awareness without ATC intervention.
- **Real-Time Weather Data:** Provides TIS-B and FIS-B.
- **Cost:** $5-10K for ADS-B Out, $20K for ADS-B In. GA market prices are decreasing.

## Scary Stuff
- The hacker side of my brain took over, and I started investigating how ADS-B works and what measures are in place to mitigate threats.
- I could not find immediate answers, which usually means the issue hasn't been considered or has been hidden.
- I discovered I'm not the only one looking into this.

## And Now The Scary Part
- **Unencrypted and Unauthenticated:** ADS-B data is unencrypted and unauthenticated.
- **Eavesdropping:** Anyone can listen to 1090Mhz and decode transmissions in real-time.
- **Injection:** Ghost flights can be injected into ATC systems.
- **Jamming:** ADS-B signals can be jammed, causing chaos.
- **GPS Jamming and Spoofing:** GPS signals can be blocked or manipulated, affecting aircraft navigation.

## Threat Mitigations?
- The FAA submitted ADS-B to NIST for security certification, but the assessment contains sensitive information.
- The FAA claims that using ADS-B does not increase risk compared to current systems, but this response is unsatisfactory.
- Multilateration, which uses time differentials between signal receiving stations, can provide some correlation, but its implementation is uncertain.

## Future
- ADS-B will be mandatory by 2020 in North America, with Europe delaying until 2030.
- It is already in use in North America, Europe, China, and Australia.
- There is still time to develop countermeasures, but we must act quickly.

## Conclusion
- This is a scary consideration, and we should all be working on finding and solving these problems.
- If I can find these issues, so can bad actors.
- Significant investments have already been made, and we need to address these vulnerabilities.
- I welcome your comments, ideas, and further research. Let's work on this together!
