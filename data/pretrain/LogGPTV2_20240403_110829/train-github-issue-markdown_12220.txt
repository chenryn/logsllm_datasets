Hi guys, I have searched around existing `Elvis Operator` in TS and no result
has found. That`s why I propose include this ability.
For example, like in C# or Groovy we can write next expression
    let result = somevalue?.name;
it desugared to
    var result = somevalue!==undefined?somevalue.name:undefined;
Is it good idea, or it has already discussed?
