### Problem
Currently the props are merged with the instance's own `data`, which has a few
problems:
  1. Both data and props can declare the same property name. The order and priority of the merging is not clear. Should a prop overwrite the field with the same name in data? Or the other way around? Currently, the props' initial values are available inside `data` functions, but the same field returned in data gets overwritten by the prop.
  2. Once merged, it's not clear whether a component property is its "private" state or a prop that is passed down from (and thus can be changed by) the parent, unless you go and check the component's props declaration.
### Proposal
~~Move props into its own name space, for example`this.props`. This avoids the
merging problem (we can either make `props` a reserved field or make it
`$props`) and makes it explicit that something is a prop that is obtained from
outside the component.~~
Throw a warning if the user defines duplicate fields in `data` and `props`.
