and without excluding preﬁxes owned by AS 4134. We see the bulk of preﬁxes
are registered to organizations in US and China, followed by Korea, Australia
and Mexico, which is consistent with observations made by BGPMon [4].
Was it Random?. Figure 2 also plots the geographic distribution of all routable
preﬁxes on the Internet. Here we can see a disproportionate number of Chinese
preﬁxes (especially belonging to AS 4134) being hijacked. Additionally, when
comparing hijacked preﬁxes to the global distribution of preﬁxes there appears
to be little evidence for attack. Indeed, the US shows fewer preﬁxes being hijacked
than would be expected based on the global distribution, while countries in the
Asia-Paciﬁc region (e.g., China, Korea, Australia) have more hijacked preﬁxes.
4.2 Which Organizations Were Most Impacted?
Organizations with the most preﬁxes announced tend to be peers of AS 4134

Critical Networks Were Subject to Hijacking. While they do not make the
top ﬁve list, China Telecom announced some critical US preﬁxes. Government
agencies such as Department of Defense, United States Patent and Trademark
Oﬃce, and Department of Transport were impacted.
4.3 Were Any of the Announcements Subpreﬁx Hijacks?
We now consider the length of the preﬁxes announced by China Telecom relative
to existing routes. If the event was simply a leak of routes contained in the routing
table, it should be the case that China Telecom’s preﬁxes will be the same length
as existing routes. Additionally, preﬁx length can shed light on the impact of the
incident since more speciﬁc preﬁxes are preferred. For each of the six Routeviews
monitors (Section 3.1), we use the RIB tables as seen on April 7 to derive the
existing preﬁx lengths. Route aggregation means that the preﬁx length observed
varies between the vantage points.
Subpreﬁx Hijacking Was Extremely Rare. In total, 21% (9,082) of the pre-
ﬁxes were longer than existing preﬁxes at all six monitors. However, 95% (8,614)
of these preﬁxes belong to China Telecom (table in full version [?]). Most of the
observed subpreﬁx hijacking is due to poor visibility of Chinese networks (AS
4134, 4538, and 38283) at the monitors. Excluding these networks, we observe
< 1% (86) preﬁxes being subpreﬁx hijacked. The lack of subpreﬁx hijacks sup-
ports the conclusion that the incident was caused by a routing table leak.
5 The Mechanics of Interception
The fact that traﬃc was able to ﬂow through China Telecom’s network and onto
the destination is highly unusual. We now discuss how interception may occur
accidentally, based on routing policies employed by networks.
5.1 How Was Interception Possible?
Two key decisions, when combined with inconsistent state within China Tele-
com’s network, allow for traﬃc to be intercepted. These properties have also
been discussed in related work [3]. We illustrate them with an example from the
China Telecom incident (Figure 3). This ﬁgure was derived using a combination
of BGP updates [19] and a traceroute observed during the incident [8].

Decision 1: AT&T (AS 7018) Chooses to Route to China Telecom. In
Figure 3, AT&T (AS 7018) has two available paths to the preﬁx. However, since
the path advertised by China Telecom (AS 4134) is shorter, AT&T (AS 7018)
chooses to route to China Telecom.
Decision 2: Level 3 (AS 3356) Chooses not to Route to China Telecom.
In order for traﬃc to leave China Telecom’s network and ﬂow on to the intended
destination, China Telecom requires a neighbor that does not choose the path it
advertises. In the example above, this occurs when Level 3 (AS 3356) chooses to
route through its customer Verizon (AS 6167) instead of through its peer China
Telecom (AS 4134). Thus, China Telecom can send traﬃc towards Level 3 and
have it arrive at the intended destination.
We next characterize what causes these decisions to be made using a combi-
nation of control- and data-plane data.
5.2 How Many ISPs Chose to Route to China Telecom?
We ﬁrst consider how many ISPs made Decision 1. We observe 44 ASes routing
traﬃc towards China Telecom, with each AS selecting the path through China
Telecom for an average of 4,342 preﬁxes. The distribution of preﬁxes each AS
routes to China Telecom is highly skewed, with some ASes being signiﬁcantly
more impacted than others. The top ﬁve ASes are summarized in Table 2, which
highlights the role of geography in the hijack, with networks operating in Europe
and Asia-Paciﬁc regions being most impacted. Academic networks (AARNet and
National LambdaRail) are also heavily impacted.
5.3 Which Preﬁxes Were Intercepted?
We develop a methodology to locate potentially intercepted preﬁxes using control-
plane data. Control-plane data has the advantage that it may be passively col-
lected in a scalable manner. We validate our technique and further analyze the
interception that occurred using data-plane measurements [15] (Section 5.4).
We use the following methodology to locate potentially intercepted preﬁxes
using only control-plane data. First, for each hijacked preﬁx, we use the Cyclops
AS-graph (discussed in Section 3.1) and a standard model of routing policies [9],
to compute China Telecom’s best path to the preﬁx.2 Next, for each of these

were unable to extract the paths normally used by China Telecom from Routeviews.
236

paths, we check whether the next-hop on China Telecom’s best path to the
destination was observed routing to China Telecom for the given preﬁx.
We observe 68% of the hijacked preﬁxes potentially being intercepted; how-
ever, 85% of these preﬁxes are observed being intercepted via AS 9304, a cus-
tomer of China Telecom, which may be an artifact of poor visibility of the
Routeviews monitors. Excluding paths through AS 9304, we observe a total of
10% (4,430) preﬁxes potentially being intercepted. We observe direct neighbors
of China Telecom such as AT&T, Sprint and Level 3 being most impacted by
interception as they still provided China Telecom (a peer) with paths to their
preﬁxes. Additionally, some Department of Defense preﬁxes may have been in-
tercepted as China Telecom potentially still had a path through Verizon.
Limitations. Our method is limited in two key ways. First, we may not observe
all announcements made by China Telecom’s neighbors (i.e., we may incorrectly
infer that they are not routing to China Telecom because their announcement is
not seen by the Routeviews monitors). Second, we do not know which neighbor
China Telecom would normally use to transit traﬃc for a given preﬁx and thus
we have to infer it based on topology measurements and a routing policy model.
Validation. Without ground-truth data it is diﬃcult to quantify the inaccura-
cies of our methodology as we may both over- or under-estimate the potential for
interception. We use the data-plane measurements described in Section 3.2 to val-
idate our methodology. Of the 479 traceroutes that were intercepted, 319 (66%)
were observed in preﬁxes detected as intercepted using our criteria. This inaccuracy
stems from a lack of control-plane data which leads to the limitations mentioned
above. With more complete data, our method could better identify potential inter-
ceptions.
5.4 Why Neighboring ASes Did Not Route to China Telecom?
We use data-plane measurements to understand why neighboring ASes chose
not to route to China Telecom (Decision 2). In Figures 3 and 1, the reason
that the neighboring AS does not route to China Telecom is because they have
a path through a customer to the destination. However, this is only one reason
an AS would choose not to route to China Telecom. We consider the cases of
interception observed in the iPlane data and determine why the neighboring AS
did not route to China Telecom using the Gao-Rexford routing policy model [9].
Table 3 summarizes the reasons neighbors of China Telecom did not route to
China Telecom. Here we only consider the 357 traceroutes where interception was
observed and a response was received from the target. The majority of neighbors
handling intercepted traﬃc did not choose the China Telecom route because it
was longer than their existing route for the preﬁx in question.
Providers Inadvertently Allowed Interception of Customer Traﬃc. A
signiﬁcant fraction (39%) of neighbor ASes do not route to China Telecom be-
cause they have a path to the destination via a customer, such as AS 3356 in
Figure 3. These providers inadvertently aided in the interception of their cus-

tomer’s traﬃc by forwarding China Telecom’s traﬃc to the destination. While
providers cannot control the traﬃc sent to them by neighboring ASes, it may be
beneﬁcial to monitor the neighbors sending traﬃc towards their customers for
anomalies, so that customers may be alerted to potential interception events.
We observe seven traceroutes where it is unclear why the China Telecom path
was not chosen. These traceroutes involved a provider to China Telecom who
chose to route towards other customers likely the result of traﬃc engineering or
static routes being used for the customer ASes.
6 Discussion
Using publicly available data sources we have characterized the China Telecom
incident that occurred in April 2010. Our study sheds light on properties of the
preﬁxes announced, and supports the conclusion that the incident was a leak of
random preﬁxes in the routing table, but does not rule out malicious intent.
On Diagnosing Routing Incidents. Our work highlights the challenge of
understanding large-scale routing incidents from a purely technical perspective.
While empirical analysis can provide evidence to support or refute hypotheses
about root cause, it cannot prove the intent behind the incident. However, em-
pirical analysis can provide a starting point for discussions about the incident.
On the Available Data. When the results of analysis can lead to real-world
reaction it is important that the data used for analysis is as complete as possible
and robustness/limitation of results are clearly stated. These two properties can
be achieved by increasing the number of BGP monitors [11] and performing
careful analysis of robustness and limitations [10].
