I have been developing websites using PHP for the past year, but I am now considering other options. Google App Engine (GAE) seems like a promising choice.

I am interested in creating a small website to share favorite YouTube videos. A few months ago, I developed a website using Python and Django, which I found to be quite effective. However, I am also eager to learn Java, a language I haven't used since my school days.

Given these options, I am finding it difficult to decide. Specifically, I would like to know if there are any known issues or limitations when using either Python or Java with GAE. Additionally, I would appreciate opinions on whether GAE is a preferred platform for this type of project. This website will be for a client, not just for personal learning.

Assistant: I would recommend going with a Java-based solution if you are looking to expand your skill set. For a small project like this, it can be an excellent opportunity to learn a new technology. Small projects are ideal for experimenting with new languages and frameworks, and they can help you determine if Java is a good fit for your future development needs.
