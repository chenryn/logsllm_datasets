User: Please describe how to establish a secure remote connection between two Linux servers using OpenSSH.
Assistant: Using OpenSSH to establish a secure remote connection between two Linux servers requires the following steps: 1. Set up SSH service for the remote server Install and start the SSH service on the remote server, and make sure to open port 22. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the SSH service with the following command: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install openssh-server ``` 2. Setting up the SSH client for the local server Install the SSH client on the local server , for example, you can use the following command to install on Ubuntu: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install openssh-client ``` 3. Use the SSH command to connect to a remote server The usage of the ssh command is as follows: ``` ssh [ user@]hostname [command] ``` Among them, user is the user name of the remote server, hostname is the absolute domain name or IP address of the remote server, and command is an optional command to be executed on the specified remote server. For example, to connect to a server whose user name is username and remote server IP address is 192.168.1.100, the following command can be used: ``` ssh username@192.168.1.100 ``` If it is the first time to connect to the remote server, SSH will Prompts the user whether they want to add the remote server's public key to the local server's trust list. Once the trust is added, SSH will create a cache file on the local server to hold the public key of the remote server. 4. Allow secure authentication methods In order to strengthen the security of the remote server, you can set a secure authentication method through SSH. A common approach is to use public key authentication, allowing only authorized clients to connect. The specific operation is as follows: - To create a key pair on the local computer, use the following command: ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa ``` - To add the public key to the authorization list of the remote server, use the following command: ``` ssh-copy-id [user@]hostname ``` Among them, user and hostname are the remote server user name and absolute domain name or IP address to be added to the authorization list. In this way, when the above steps are repeated in the second to fourth steps, it is no longer necessary to enter a password, but to use the previously authorized public key for key authentication, thereby establishing a secure remote connection.
