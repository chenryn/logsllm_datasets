### Title: IPvSeeYou: Exploiting Leaked Identifiers in IPv6 for Street-Level Geolocation

**Abstract:**

IP geolocation, the process of mapping an IP address to a physical location, is widely used but often limited to city-level accuracy and can be inaccurate. With "IPvSeeYou," we introduce a data fusion attack targeting residential home routers running IPv6, enabling street-level geolocation. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of IPvSeeYou by precisely locating millions of home routers deployed globally.

**Introduction:**

Current IP geolocation techniques and tools typically provide only city-level locations, which are often imprecise. In this work, we present "IPvSeeYou," a method that leverages leaked identifiers in IPv6 addresses to achieve street-level geolocation. Our approach assumes a remote adversary with no privileged access to the target network.

**Methodology:**

The core of our privacy attack lies in the use of EUI-64-formatted IPv6 addresses, which embed the hardware MAC address of the network interface. Although most modern operating systems no longer use EUI-64, it is still prevalent in legacy and low-cost customer premises equipment (CPE), such as commodity routers used in residential and business settings.

In IPv6, CPE devices are typically routed hops rather than NATs, allowing us to discover their MAC addresses using traceroute if they use EUI-64. These CPE devices often integrate Wi-Fi functionality, and the MAC address of the Wi-Fi interface is frequently related to the MAC address of the wide area interface, often differing by a small offset (e.g., Â±1).

Wi-Fi MAC addresses (BSSIDs) are broadcast and captured by wardriving databases, which also record their physical locations. By correlating the MAC addresses embedded in IPv6 home router addresses with their corresponding Wi-Fi BSSIDs, we can remotely and accurately geolocate these routers, fusing virtual data with real-world locations.

**Implementation and Results:**

To demonstrate the practicality of IPvSeeYou, we developed an Internet-scale IPv6 router discovery technique that identifies tens of millions of deployed CPE devices with EUI-64 addresses. We then map these addresses to their corresponding Wi-Fi BSSIDs on a per-OUI basis. By searching for these BSSIDs in geolocation databases, we successfully mapped millions of routers across the world to precise physical locations.

**Conclusion:**

"IPvSeeYou" represents a significant advancement in IP geolocation, providing street-level accuracy by exploiting the relationship between EUI-64 IPv6 addresses and Wi-Fi BSSIDs. This method has broad implications for both security and privacy, highlighting the need for better protection of device identifiers in networked environments.
