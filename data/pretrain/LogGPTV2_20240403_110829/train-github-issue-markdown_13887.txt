Deleting files from the right-click menu in the sidebar fails to actually
delete the file. After clicking "delete" in the menu, the dialog pops up
asking me if I want to move the file/dir to the trash. So I click "Move to
trash" and then nothing happens. The file is still visible in the sidebar, and
it still exists on my filesystem.
I'm on Linux (Debian) x64, Atom version 0.126, but I had the same problem with
0.124 and 0.123
