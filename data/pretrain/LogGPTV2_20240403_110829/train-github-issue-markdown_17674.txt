Below is a comparison of the code as it appears at the end of waypoint 18, displayed on a 333px wide Chrome window, a 255px wide Firefox window, and the simulator. To generate the first two images, I copied the code and included the necessary Bootstrap and Font Awesome files, adding the links above the `<head>` block as follows:

```html
<!-- Add your links here -->
```

A partial workaround for the layout issue would be to use shorter button and label names. While this would not fully resolve the problem (as the delete button would still be cut off), it would at least improve the alignment.

In response to a similar issue on Glitter, I was advised to get accustomed to designing for narrow phone screens. The last smartphone I owned that was less than 333px wide was the original Galaxy Ace, which had a width of 320px. Therefore, I believe a 350px wide simulation would cover most of the current smartphones in use today.

Although I have extensive experience in software development, I am relatively new to web development, so I may have overlooked something obvious. Nonetheless, I appreciate what you are doing here; it aligns perfectly with what I was looking for.
