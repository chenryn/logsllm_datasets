The image below compares the code as it exists at the end of waypoint 18 on a
333px wide Chrome window, a 255px wide Firefox window and the simulator. To
get the first two images I copied the code and added the necessary bootstrap /
fontawesome files, and I added links above the  block as follows.  
A partial work around would be to use shorter button and label names. The
delete button would still be chopped off, but at least things would line up.
On Glitter, the advice I got was to get used to narrow phones. :) The last
smart phone I had that was less than 333px wide was the original Galaxy Ace at
320px. So I'm thinking that a 350px wide simulation would cover most phones in
use these days.
I have a lot of development experience, but I'm just getting started when it
comes to web development, so I may have missed something obvious. In any case,
I like what you're doing here. It is just what I was looking for.
