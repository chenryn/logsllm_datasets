User: I need to verify if some user is valid SVN user or not in my application. I want to achieve this using SVN commandline tools/Tortoise SVN Commndline or Python in windows. I looked up PySVN but it seems to me that there is no way to authenticate a current user in that library.
Please suggest some way of doing the same.
Thank You
Assistant: Take a look at the documentation for pysvn.Client.callback_* and you will see that the methods you have to provide handle prompting for passwords and errors if they don't match.
