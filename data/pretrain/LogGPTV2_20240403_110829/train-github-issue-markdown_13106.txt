We need to implement a feature that allows saving files requiring administrative access. A good approach, as demonstrated by Sublime Text, is to prompt the user for their password via a dialog box when they attempt to save such a file.

Currently, attempting to save a file without the necessary permissions results in the following error:

```
Uncaught Error: EACCES, permission denied '/private/etc/apache2/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf' - fs.js
```

To enhance the user experience and ensure proper functionality, we should add this administrative permission prompt.
