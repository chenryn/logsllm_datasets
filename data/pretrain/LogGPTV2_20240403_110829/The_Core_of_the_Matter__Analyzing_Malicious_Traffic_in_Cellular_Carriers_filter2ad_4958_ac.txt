### 3. Results

#### 3.1 Overview

We present the results of our experimental evaluation, starting with an analysis of the traffic observed in the cellular carrier. We first characterize the data from the cellular carrier in isolation and then compare it to the request patterns observed historically in our non-cellular ISP dataset. We then examine the extent to which the hosts observed in mobile resolution requests are directly or indirectly tainted by reputation information collected in non-cellular ISPs.

#### 3.2 Mobile-Specific Malware

We further focus on evidence of mobile-specific malware. We analyze the directly tainted hosts in mobile resolutions to determine the originating mobile platforms. Additionally, we examine all cellular network queries for mobile-malware-specific domains to determine the extent of the presence of mobile malware in the cellular network.

#### 3.3 Long-Term Analysis of Known Mobile Threats

We conclude our results with a long-term analysis of two known mobile threats, studying their rise until they become almost completely inactive. We provide a global infection perspective and examine their hosting infrastructure and how it changes over time.

### 4. Analysis of Reputation Datasets

#### 4.1 Cellular Carrier Traffic

We analyze the DNS traffic generated from approximately 380 million mobile IDs over the observation period. The filtering process results in the set HOST Sall, consisting of 2,902,071 unique hosts with the following characteristics:
- At least one resolution request for each host was observed by the cellular carrier.
- The observed DNS requests came strictly from devices classified as mobile.
- The hosts are not associated with any known benign infrastructure.
- The host is a routable IP address.

We obtain passive DNS information on each of these hosts from our historical non-cellular ISP dataset.

**Figure 4(a):** Distribution of unique hosts in the set HOST Sall, showing that more than 18% of the hosts requested by mobile devices are associated with only a single domain.

**Figure 4(b):** 98.7% of hosts in the set HOST Sall have at least one historically associated domain name according to the passive DNS data collection from the non-cellular ISP.

#### 4.2 Observations from Mobile Markets and Malware Datasets

We characterize application markets and datasets of known mobile malicious applications. Specifically, we examine all applications in Proandroid, Sofandroid, Anzhi, Ndoo, and the top 500 free applications from each category in Google Play. We also analyze three datasets containing known mobile malware, including samples from the Contagio blog, 596 apps from Zhou et al., and a confidential dataset M1 provided by an independent security company.

**Figure 7:** Distribution of qnames for each subset of the m&a dataset, showing that at least 90% of the hosts in HOST Sm&a are present in our non-cellular pDNS dataset.
