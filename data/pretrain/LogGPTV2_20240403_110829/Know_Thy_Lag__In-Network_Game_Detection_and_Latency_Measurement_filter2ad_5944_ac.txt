nantly use local servers (50 ms or lower); League of Legends and CoD:MW use only
a small number of local servers; while Hearthstone and Genshin Impact do not have
any servers operational in the local country (the closest ones being 100+ ms away). It
is also interesting to see that servers are clustered for some games (e.g., Hearthstone,
Genshin Impact, WoW), highlighting servers co-located in the same CDN. Curiously,
though WoW and Hearthstone are from the same publisher (and share the AS owned by
Blizzard), only WoW uses local in-country servers.
To highlight the deeper dynamics of latency, we focus on League of Legends (LoL)
and show in Fig. 6 the distribution of latency across various server preﬁxes, color-coded
by their country of residence. The game connected to 293 servers located in 8 countries

spanning 22 routing preﬁxes. We observe that it has only one routing preﬁx locally
(P1) that offers a very low latency of under 5 ms. Across other preﬁxes, we make a
couple of observations. First, preﬁxes (P3, P4, P9) and (P13, P15), while located in
China, belong to two different ASes and hence give very different latencies. In fact,
P13 is geographically closer to P3 but the latter is one AS hop away while P13 is 3 AS
hops away, leading to a latency differential of about 100 ms. Second, preﬁxes (P5, P6,
P16) belong to the same AS and are located in USA. They are all one AS away from
the source but P16 has a 120 ms higher latency, illustrating that routing paths can vary
for different subnets even within the same AS (in this case owned by Riot Games, the
publisher of LoL). Further, counter-intuitively, preﬁx P16 is geographically closer (to
game client) than P5 and P6. This analysis can help ISPs identify game server locations
and routing preﬁxes so they can tune their peering relationships and path selections to
improve latency for their gamers.
3.3 Comparing Gaming Latencies from Multiple ISPs
To better illustrate the impact of peering relationships and routing paths on latency,
we performed active latency measurements (using an automated script) from several
volunteers’ home broadband connections in our local city to the game servers discov-
ered in Sect. 2. The volunteers were spread across four residential ISPs (numbered II-V,
with ISP-I representing the University), and we found that the average latency to game

servers outside the country varied signiﬁcantly across these ISPs, as illustrated in Fig. 7
for two representative games namely Genshin Impact and CS:GO.
Genshin Impact has no local servers, and a majority of its servers are in Japan (JP).
It can be seen that ISP-III offers the lowest latency of 119 ms while the latency is much
higher (at around 198 ms) with ISP-V. The USA serves the next higher number of ses-
sions of Genshin Impact, and in this case ISPs II-V provide a latency of around 200 ms,
while the University’s ISP-I has 300+ ms latency. For Denmark (DE), ISP II provides
the highest latency at 322 ms. Overall, a Genshin Impact gamer would get a better expe-
rience if they were with ISP-III. However, any ISP with this visibility into game server
locations can optimise their routing paths to improve the gamer experience.
The difference across ISPs for CS:GO is even more stark, as shown in the right side
of Fig. 7. In this case ISP-V offers a signiﬁcantly worse latency to CS:GO servers in
Singapore (SG) and India (IN). Given that CS:GO is a tournament-grade ﬁrst-person
shooting game, the latency handicap induced by ISP-V will be unacceptable to gamers,
and likely to lead to complaints and churn. The situation is very avoidable – indeed we
have reached out to this ISP, urging them to look into their peering relationships and
routing path selections to address this issue.
4 Related Work
Signature Generation & Classiﬁcation: Automatic signature extraction methods were
ﬁrst proposed a decade ago in the context of malware detection [16]. Work in [22]
generates regular expressions from the payloads of un-encrypted protocols to detect
application types. Bitcoding [13] proposes generating bit-level signatures for network
applications by identifying bit positions that do not change in value. In a recent work
[21], authors identify smart home devices and their events using signatures based on
packet sizes and directions. Our methods build upon the prior work to generate sig-
natures speciﬁc to online games. Our signature extraction is similar to [13]. However,
it is faster since it looks for constant bytes in the payload instead of bits. Further, our
algorithm incorporates port values in addition to byte patterns.
Gaming Applications: Several aspects of gaming applications have been studied in the
past, including the impact of device-level attributes such as frame rates, and network-
level parameters such as latency and loss across different games. The authors of [7]
Know Thy Lag

were among the ﬁrst to analyze the effect of network parameters like delay, jitters, and
packet loss on the game Unreal Tournament using real players. Subsequently, work in
[10] analyzed multiple games using real players and [8] used bots to remove the skill
bias of players. A common approach taken in these studies was to artiﬁcially induce
delay/jitters/packet losses and observe the change in experience using MOS, win rates,
game scores, etc. The authors in [9] studied the impact of latency on different player
actions in games that have varying precision and deadline requirements. Their recent
work [15] surveys the impact of different latencies on different game genres and users,
concluding that gamers indeed feel the impact of high latency, especially in competitive
multiplayer games. Work in [20] shows that latency is a more contributing factor than
screen refresh rates in gamer performance. All prior works collectively highlight that
reducing latency to gaming servers improves gaming performance and experience.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
The gaming industry is experiencing explosive growth, and ISPs are keen to offer a
better gaming experience to their subscribers. However, they are hamstrung by the lack
of visibility into gaming patterns, servers, and latencies. We collected and analyzed
packet traces from ten popular games across various genres, extracted packet attributes,
and developed a deterministic model to identify games based on automatically gener-
ated game-speciﬁc signatures. We deployed our system on live trafﬁc of a university
network, and over a 1-month period detected 31 k game sessions to gain insights into
game popularity and gaming engagement. We then related game latencies to routing
paths by performing BGP/Geo lookups and active latency measurements to the 4,500+
game servers identiﬁed. We illustrated how the spread of games servers across ASes and
countries impacts latency. Finally, we showed that ISPs serving gamers in the same city
have varying latencies to these game servers, inﬂuenced by their peering relationships.
While this paper studied ten popular games, we plan to evaluate the efﬁcacy of the pro-
posed method on a wider set of games. If conﬂicts arise amongst games, the classiﬁer
may require richer signatures extracted from more packets and/or deeper payload con-
tents of individual packets. Another avenue for future work is analysis of public peering
datasets to offer low-latency peering recommendations within cost budgets to ISPs.

B Fortnite Game Signature Generation
Fig. 8. An illustrative example of signature generation using Fortnite trafﬁc traces.
As shown in Fig. 8 above, each row corresponds to attributes extracted from the ﬁrst
few packets of Fortnite gaming ﬂows from our dataset. The attributes include protocol,
transport layer port numbers, packet sizes and payload bytes. In one ﬂow (identiﬁed by
the standard ﬁve-tuple), protocol and server port remain the same but the packet sizes
and content vary as more packets arrive. For this illustration, the table shows 5 packet
sizes in each direction and (stripped) payload content of the ﬁrst packet.
Some attribute values (shown in red) are ﬁxed/constant across all the ﬂows (called
static signatures) and other (shown in green) fall within a close range of values (called
dynamic signatures). These signatures are same across the ﬂows implying that they can
detect a Fortnite game session. Using the static and dynamic signatures, a signature
JSON is built as shown in the next section which is then used as an input to the game
classiﬁer algorithmic model.
C Example Game Signatures
Figure 9 shows example signatures generated from our dataset. We can see that while
all attributes have a key and a value, only ports has a range since it is a dynamic sig-
nature. We note that the complexity of signatures varies: some are primarily based on
packet size (Rocket League) while others require payload bytes too (Fortnite and Call

of Duty MW); some are based on attributes of ﬁrst two packets (Fortnite and Rocket
League) while others require more data (Call of Duty MW). These signatures need to
be combined to predict the actual game being played as they may have some common
attributes for e.g., both Fortnite and Call of Duty MW have the ﬁrst upload packet length
as 29 and thus require further inspection to classify the game. The classiﬁer model takes
into account all attributes and looks at the minimum number of packets to rapidly detect
the game.
