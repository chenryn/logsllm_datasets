I am part of a team that is preparing to launch the beta version of a web application, built on Python (Django specifically), along with a suite of backend tools. Our team has recently expanded from 2 to 4 members and we anticipate further growth over the next few months. One challenge we have encountered is ensuring that all team members can set up their development environments efficiently and correctly, including the installation of necessary packages.

To address this, I am exploring methods to streamline the process and reduce the potential for errors. Both zc.buildout and virtualenv appear to be suitable for managing Python-specific issues. However, our project also includes smaller sub-projects in other languages, such as Java and Ruby, as well as several Python extensions that require native compilation (e.g., lxml, MySQL drivers). A significant obstacle has been compiling these extensions against the correct versions of shared libraries to avoid segmentation faults, memory allocation errors, and similar problems. Additionally, our team uses four different development environments: one Mac OS X Leopard on PowerPC, one Mac OS X Leopard on Intel, one Ubuntu, and one Windows.

Our ideal solution would involve a simple command-line process, something like:
```
$ git clone [repository URL]
...
$ python setup-env.py
...
```
This script would perform the functions of zc.buildout/virtualenv (such as copying or symlinking the Python interpreter and providing a clean space for package installations) and then install all required packages, including any necessary native shared library dependencies. It would also handle the installation of the Ruby and Java projects. This tool would be invaluable not only for setting up development environments but also for deploying on staging and production servers.

While a Python-based solution would be preferable, given its status as the primary language of our team, I am open to suggestions in other languages. My question is: Does anyone have recommendations for better alternatives or experiences they can share using one of these solutions to manage more extensive and diverse installation bases?

One approach you might consider is creating virtual machine (VM) appliances with your production operating system and all necessary software dependencies pre-installed. Team members can either edit code remotely or use a shared folder. This method has proven effective in previous projects with complex development environments.
