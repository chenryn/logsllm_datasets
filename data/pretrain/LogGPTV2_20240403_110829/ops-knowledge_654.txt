User: In user interface of Google App Engine, in "Instances" I can shutdown selected instances by press button "Shutdown".
Can I do shutdown by program from source code?
Assistant: Actually you can force an instance to shutdown within your code, but it's not pretty.
Just allocate more memory than you instance has, it will be then shutdown for you.
I have used this technique in some python2.5 M/S apps where a DeadlineExceeded during startup could cause problems with incomplete imports.  If the next handled request gave me an ImportError somewhere I knew the instance was toast, so I would redirect the user to the site, and then create a really big string exhausting memory, and then that instance would be shutdown.
You could in theory do something similiar.
