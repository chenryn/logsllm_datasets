In the Google App Engine user interface, under the "Instances" section, you can manually shut down selected instances by pressing the "Shutdown" button. However, you may be wondering if it's possible to programmatically shut down an instance from your source code.

While there is no direct API call to shut down an instance, you can force an instance to terminate by intentionally exhausting its memory. This method, although not ideal, can be used in certain situations. For example, I have employed this technique in some Python 2.5 Master/Slave (M/S) applications where a `DeadlineExceeded` error during startup could lead to incomplete imports. If a subsequent request resulted in an `ImportError`, I would determine that the instance was compromised and needed to be terminated. In such cases, I would redirect the user to another page, then generate a very large string to consume all available memory, causing the instance to shut down.

You could theoretically implement a similar approach in your application, but it's important to note that this method is a workaround and may not be suitable for all use cases.
