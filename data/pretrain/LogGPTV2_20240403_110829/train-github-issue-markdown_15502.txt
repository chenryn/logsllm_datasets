**Issue Type:**
Bug Report

**Ansible Version:**
1.9.0.1

**Environment:**
- Managing: CentOS 6
- From: MacOS X 10.10.2

**Summary:**
The `service` module in Ansible is unable to start an upstart service on a CentOS 6 system. This issue did not occur in version 1.8.4 but is present in version 1.9.0.1.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ansible <hostname> -m service -a 'name=<servicename> state=started'
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- The specified service should start successfully, as it does in Ansible version 1.8.4.

**Actual Results:**
- Ansible fails to start the service and returns the following error:
  ```json
  {
      "failed": true, 
      "msg": "<servicename>: unrecognized service"
  }
  ```
- Example:
  ```bash
  $ ansible ns1.ams.as112.ripe.net -u root -m service -a 'name=ansible state=started'
  ns1.ams.as112.ripe.net | FAILED >> {
      "failed": true, 
      "msg": "ansible: unrecognized service\n"
  }
  ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue seems to be specific to the `service` module and its interaction with upstart services on CentOS 6.
- Further investigation is needed to determine the root cause of this regression.
