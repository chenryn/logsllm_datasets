User: I have Mac OS X 10.5.7 with Python 2.5. I need to test a package I am working on with Python 2.3 for compatibility. I don't want to downgrade my whole system so is there a way to do an install of Python 2.3 that does not change the system python?
Assistant: One alternative is to use a virtual machine. 
With something like VMWare Fusion or Virtualbox you could install a complete Linux system with Python2.3, and do your testing there. The advantage is that it would be completely sand-boxed, so wouldn't affect your main system at all.
