### Title: Botconf2019 - Tracking Malware Samples on a Budget

I would like to share my experience in developing and operating a malware tracker, focusing on the various aspects such as data feeds, development choices, architectural designs, methodologies, crawling heuristics, data pivots, special cases, deception techniques, and the results achieved. The goal of this project was to collect and analyze fresh malware samples from open-source data, with minimal cost. 

Two years ago, as a student in computer security, I became interested in learning how to discover and analyze malware samples in the wild. I found inspiration in existing malware and C2 (Command and Control) trackers such as Cybercrime Tracker, Malc0de, and Malekal. These tools, which seem to be a French specialty, intrigued me, and I set out to understand their inner workings and develop my own solution.

The core of this project involves identifying URLs that distribute malicious files, filtering these samples based on specific features, processing them through multiple analyzers, and storing the results. This approach allows for an efficient and cost-effective way to track and analyze malware.
