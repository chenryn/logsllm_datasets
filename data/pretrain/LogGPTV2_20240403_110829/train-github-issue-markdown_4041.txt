This issue is a duplicate of #3695 and involves additional problematic behavior. The `.julia` directory in question is relatively new and, to my knowledge, has only been used with Pkg2. Currently, only one package, `Options`, is installed.

When attempting to add the `Winston` package, the following sequence of events occurs:

```julia
julia> Pkg2.add("Winston")
MESSAGE: Cloning BinDeps from git://github.com/loladiro/BinDeps.jl.git
MESSAGE: Cloning Winston from git://github.com/nolta/Winston.jl.git
MESSAGE: Cloning Cairo from git://github.com/JuliaLang/Cairo.jl.git
MESSAGE: Cloning Color from git://github.com/JuliaLang/Color.jl.git
MESSAGE: Cloning IniFile from git://github.com/JuliaLang/IniFile.jl.git
MESSAGE: Cloning Tk from git://github.com/JuliaLang/Tk.jl.git
MESSAGE: Installing BinDeps v0.2.0
MESSAGE: Upgrading Options: v0.2.1- => v0.2.1
fatal: reference is not a tree: f1417b80ec7f3338275b2b692f7dc33289e50935
MESSAGE: Rolling back install of BinDeps
mv: cannot stat `BinDeps': No such file or directory
ErrorException("failed process: Process(`mv BinDeps .trash/`, ProcessExited(1)) [1]")
```

The error message "reference is not a tree" indicates that the specified Git reference (commit, tag, or branch) does not exist. As a result, the installation process fails, and Pkg2 attempts to roll back the installation. However, the rollback process also fails, as the `BinDeps` directory does not exist, leading to multiple `mv` command errors and `ErrorException` messages.

To summarize, the problem can be broken down into the following steps:
1. Attempt to add the `Winston` package.
2. Cloning of several dependent packages.
3. Installation of `BinDeps` v0.2.0.
4. Upgrade of the `Options` package.
5. Failure due to an invalid Git reference.
6. Repeated failed attempts to roll back the installation of `BinDeps`.

This issue needs to be addressed to ensure the successful installation and management of packages using Pkg2.
