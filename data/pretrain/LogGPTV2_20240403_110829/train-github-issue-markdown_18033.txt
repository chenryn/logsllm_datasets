Is it possible to augment the type definition for `ComponentOptions`?
I am using the vue-inject plugin which allows specifying the `dependencies`
section in a component definition. Unfortunately, I can't get it to work the
right way.
My `vue-augmented.d.ts` looks like this:
    import Vue from "vue";
    declare module "vue" {
        export type ComponentOptions = {
            dependencies?: string | string[] | { [key: string]: string };
        }
    }
Typescript throws an error:
    [ts] Duplicate identifier 'ComponentOptions'.
P.S. It does work as expected if you hack the original `options.d.ts` file
provided by Vue, but this solution is unacceptable :(
