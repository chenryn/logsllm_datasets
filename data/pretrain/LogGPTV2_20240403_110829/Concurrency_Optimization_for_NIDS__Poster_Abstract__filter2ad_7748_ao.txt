Background Chemotherapy options for treating colorectal cancer (CRC) have expanded in recent years Treatment benefit is assessed in a costly 
and untimely manner, typically by serial CT scans beginning 2 – 3 months after starting drug Our aim was to develop a blood-based biomarker that 
would identify patients who are not responding to chemotherapy, soon after chemotherapy is initiated Methods Samples and linked clinical data 
of metastatic colorectal cancer patients were obtained from a large clinical trial (NCIC-CTG CO20)Response to chemotherapy was determined 
by RECIST 11 criteria Serial plasma metabolomic profiles from a discovery set of patients(n=68), treated with cetuximab or cetuximab+brivanib, 
and disease-free controls(n=48) were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) A response model for CRC was derived 
using orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) based on treatment-related changes in metabolites Metabolomic models 
suitable for distinguishing response categories and progression of disease were generated Results Using GC-MS, 386 compounds were detected 
By as early as 4 weeks after chemotherapy was initiated, treatment-related changes that discriminated measurable response, stable disease and 
progression could be detected The model that signaled disease progression (which marks treatment futility) was robust (R2Y=0822; Q2Y=0605; 
P-Value=<00001) This biomarker consisted of 25 metabolites, including important intermediates involved in nucleotide synthesis and energy 
metabolism Conclusions Treatment-related changes in circulating metabolites appear shortly after initiating chemotherapy The pattern of changes 
varies with the type of treatment response Progressive disease has a particularly distinct set of changes External validation will be required to 
further assess these biomarkers

Early-life exposures are believed to play an important etiologic role in the development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Yet direct 
analysis of exposures have not been undertaken to date, primarily due to technological barriers Archived neonatal blood spots (NBS) collected 
within the first days of life offer a means to investigate small molecules that reflect early-life exposures and biological response that pre-date the 
onset of clinical disease We obtained NBS for 334 ALL cases and 324 healthy matched controls as part of the California Childhood Leukemia Study 
Untargeted metabolomics was performed on the extracts of NBS punches (47-mm, ~ 8 µL of blood), with an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system connected 
to a 6550 QTOF HRMS (Santa Clara, USA) in ESI (-) mode Subjects were stratified by early (1-5 y) and late (6-14 y) diagnosis, and an ensemble of 
feature-selection methods used to pinpoint metabolites predictive of case status Covariates representing suspected risk factors for ALL were 
also evaluated Mutually-exclusive sets of lipids and fatty acids were associated with ALL phenotypes, including 9 and 19 metabolites in the early- 
and late-diagnosis groups, respectively In the late-diagnosis group, a prominent cluster of metabolites contained molecules with 18:2 fatty-acid 
chains, suggesting that newborn exposure to the essential nutrient, linoleic acid, increased ALL risk Interestingly, abundances of these 18:2 lipids 
were greater in infants who were fed formula rather than breast milk (colostrum) and increased with the mother’s pre-pregnancy body mass index, 
suggesting possible etiologic roles of newborn nutrition

Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide The clinical management is challenging due to 
CRC innate and/or acquired multidrug resistance to standard and targeted chemotherapies as well as resistance to immuno-oncology approaches 
We studied the anticancer effects of 4’-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol (MNF) acting through the inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 and 
activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor We provide the results from untargeted metabolomics analysis of plasma and tumor tissues obtained from 
(R,R’)-MNF-treated and control animals, designed to explore the biological mechanisms associated with the observed antitumor response and to 
identify potential biomarkers of these effects Female BALB/c mice with a subcutaneous CT26 CRC tumor were divided into three experimental 
groups: (R,R’)-MNF at 20mg/kg (n=9) or 30mg/kg (n=8), and a vehicle-treated (n=10) The changes in plasma and tumor metabolomic profiles associated 
with the MNF action were evaluated by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS) analysis Raw data acquired was pre-
processed, filtered, and corrected for signal drift A combination of univariate and multivariate statistical analyses was used to evaluate the drug effect 
on CRC Metabolite annotation was accomplished by searching against several databases including HMDB, KEGG, Metlin, and LipidMaps Among the 
most differentiated metabolites whose levels were significantly impacted by MNF were those belonging to the lipid metabolism pathway, including 
glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterol lipids These results are consistent with our previous data reporting MNF activity in pancreatic cancer 
The knowledge generated in this study has advanced our understanding of the anticancer molecular mechanisms of MNF

High mortality rates exist for individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma There is a critical need for discovery of early stage HCC biomarkers to elicit 
rapid and effective treatments GC-MS based metabolomics is an ideal approach for investigating cancer physiology for discovery of liver disease 
diagnostic markers The objective of this research study was to implement an untargeted, multiplatform, analytical approach for identification of 
candidate HCC biomarkers in humans using comprehensive GC- and GCxGC-TOFMS After sample preparation the dry samples were derivatized 
in two-steps: 1) Methoximation and 2) silylation Derivatized samples and quality control standards were injected into the chromatograph and 
separation performed using two different polarity columns Mass spectra were collected using a mass range of 50 to 510 and an acquisition rate 
of 10 spectra per second (200 sps for GCxGC) Data were processed using untargeted Peak Find and compounds were characterized through 
retention index filtering, similarity searches and formula determinations Analyses of plasma samples resulted in composition maps displaying a 
wide variety of compounds including acids, diacids, amino acids, bases, fatty acids, a large assortment of simple sugars, and reduced/oxidized 
sugars Transitioning from GC-TOFMS to high performance GCxGC-TOFMS resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in characterized compounds 
Statistical processing of the data led to the identification of potential candidate markers for HCC disease including organic acids, amino acids and 
reduced sugars

Diagnosing dying and predicting prognosis for palliative patients is an ongoing problem for physicians as there are few good biomarkers (Reid, VL 
et al, PLoS One, 2017) Having more certainty about prognosis is crucial for patients, their families and clinicians to provide the best care possible 
We hypothesise there is a metabolic process to dying that could yield quantifiable biomarkers A feasibility study showed that volatile organic 
compounds (VOCs) in urine changed in the last days and weeks of life in a small mixed cancer group (Coyle, S et al, BMJ Open, 2016) In this 
pilot study: 424 urine samples were collected from 162 patients with advanced lung cancer from six sites across Merseyside 63 patients provided 
a sample in the last month (28 days) of life and 29 patients in the last week of life Urinary VOCs were examined by gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (GC-MS) Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to analyse data and create models 
A model predicting whether an individual would die within three days based on only two VOCs, generated an AUC = 080 (068-093), was 93% 
specific and 68% sensitive Other models predicting between 4-10 days of life or 11-17 days of life remaining were generated Urine analysis could 
be used to predict the dying process and lead to the identification of prognostic biomarkers Future work will focus on optimisation of urinary VOC 
analysis, refinement of models and verifying in a validation cohort of patients with lung and other cancers

Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease and one of the major causes of cancer death in women One of the main hallmarks of cancer is the 
ability of cancer cells to alter their metabolic phenotype, which allows them to survive and proliferate against all odds Therefore, the aim of this 
study was to apply LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics approach, as previously described [1], in order to identify new metabolomic biomarkers 
associated with BC pathology Study included plasma samples from BC patients prior to any treatment (N=41) and matching controls (N=30) Fifty-
seven chemical compounds were found to be significantly altered in BC patients The resulting list of statistically significant accurate masses was 
annotated using the CEU Mass Mediator search tool (http://ceumassepsuspceues/mediator/), and the biological role of suggested compounds was 
additionally evaluated to exclude the less probable identification matches Our results indicate a significant increase in the expression of different 
fatty acyls, including several straight chain, branched and unsaturated fatty acids, docosanoids, eicosanoids, octadecanoids, fatty aldehydes and 
amides Increased levels of certain monoacylglycerols and different glycerophospholipids were also found to be characteristic for BC subjects We 
also detected alteration of amino acid and bilirubin metabolism in BC patients and differential expression of C19 and C20 steroids These findings 
suggest a key role of lipid classes and molecular species in BC growth and development and possibly lead us a step closer to new metabolomic 
biomarkers in BC

CO-AUTHORS: Diana Behrens, Amy Harms, Thomas Hankemeier
Despite all the progresses made in the identification of molecular alterations related to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC), 
effective treatment is still lacking, to reduce the high mortality rate in this cancer To move forward in pancreatic cancer research, new concepts 
and methods are required, to find better drug targets and early diagnostics markers We used metabolomics to investigate the effects of the 
anti-cancer drugs gemcitabine, abraxane (Nab-paclitaxel) and erlotinib on the metabolism of newly developed patient derived xenografts (PDX) 
For this purpose, targeted metabolomics platforms that cover metabolites of major metabolic pathways including glycolysis, central metabolism, 
lipids, amino acids, and signalling lipids (inflammatory mediators), were applied to treated and non-treated tumor tissues from patient derived 
xenografts of two patients The comparison between the metabolomics profiles of treated and untreated models, revealed changes in the metabolic 
profiles In xenografts derived from one patient, abraxane treatment significantly decreased the levels of amino acids and increased the levels 
of lipid metabolites, while an increase in the level of sphingomyelins was observed with gemcitabine treatment However, no significant changes 
were observed in the metabolic profiles of the second patient upon treatment Our findings can contribute to the understanding of oncogenic 
mechanisms in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer as well as improve the monitoring of treatments in this cancer

The Effects of Omega-3 Supplementation on the Brain Lipidome after Chemotherapy
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rachel Kopec, The Ohio State University, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Djawed Bennouna, Melissa Solano, Tonya S. Orchard, Maryam B. Lustberg, A. Courtney DeVries
Breast cancer chemotherapy agents negatively affect long-term brain functioning in some breast cancer survivors Neuroinflammattory damage 
may play an important role in changing brain structure or altering signaling, resulting in cognitive impairment We hypothesized that a diet enriched 
with long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), would result in a greater inflammation resolving response mediated by specialized 
pro-resolving mediators (SPMs ie omega-3 derived metabolites which attenuate inflammation), and reduce oxidation of hippocampal brain lipids 
To determine how n-3 PUFA supplementation may confer protection after chemotherapy, ovariectomized, C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet with or 
without 2% n-3 PUFA enrichment for 4-6 weeks, followed by a two-injection chemotherapy or vehicle regimen In study 1, animals (n=120) were 
sacrificed at 4, 7, and 14 days after the last injection, and targeted HPLC-MS/MS analyses quantitated specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) in 
whole brain In study 2, animals (n=80) were sacrificed 7 days after the last injection, and untargeted LC-HRMS lipidomics were performed on the 
hippocampus Study 1: SPM resolvin D1 was quantifiable in all samples regardless of treatment or dietary group, but no differences were observed 
Study 2: PLS-DA modeling revealed ~500 metabolites driving significant separation between the n-3 PUFA supplemented vs non-supplemented 
animals (R2=067, Q2=064, P-value= 0014), and that this dietary effect was greater than the effect of chemotherapy 7-days post-chemotherapy 
treatment Identification of distinguishing lipids is ongoing Taken together, the results of studies 1 and 2 suggest that other, non-inflammatory 
pathways are likely involved in driving this separation between lipids

Urine-NMR metabolomics for screening of advanced colorectal adenoma and early stage colorectal cancer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Hyuk Nam Kwon, University of Helsinki, Finland
CO-AUTHORS: Eun Ran Kim, Hoonsik Nam, Jae J. Kim, Sunghyouk park, Young-Ho Kim
Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered one of the most preventable cancers, no non-invasive, accurate diagnostic tool to screen CRC exists 
We explored the potential of urine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics as a diagnostic tool for early detection of CRC, focusing on 
advanced adenoma and stage 0 CRC Urine metabolomics profiles from patients with colorectal neoplasia (CRN; 36 advanced adenomas and 56 
CRCs at various stages, n = 92) and healthy controls (normal, n = 156) were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy Healthy and CRN groups were statistically 
discriminated using orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis (opLs-DA) the class prediction model was validated by three-fold 
cross-validation The advanced adenoma and stage 0 CRC were grouped together as pre-invasive CRN The OPLS-DA score plot showed statistically 
significant discrimination between pre-invasive CRN as well as advanced CRC and healthy controls with a Q2 value of 0746 In the prediction validation 
study, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing pre-invasive CRN were 962% and 95%, respectively The grades predicted by the OPLS-DA model 
showed that the areas under the curve were 0823 for taurine, 0783 for alanine, and 0842 for 3-aminoisobutyrate In multiple receiver operating 
characteristics curve analyses, taurine, alanine, and 3-aminoisobutyrate were good discriminators for CRC patients NMR-based urine metabolomics 
profiles significantly and accurately discriminate patients with pre-invasive CRN as well as advanced CRC from healthy individuals Urine-NMR 
metabolomics has potential as a screening tool for accurate diagnosis of pre-invasive CRN

Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease, with multiple different oncogenic driver mutations Currently, there are no 
successful treatment targeting NSCLC KRAS-mutated patients In NSCLC roughly half of the tumors with activating KRAS genetic lesions also have 
serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1) deletions or inactivating mutations The presence of LKB1 loss in KRAS-mutant tumor may represent a significant 
source of heterogeneity and contribute to the worst response to therapy Since both KRAS and LKB1 lesions have impact on cellular metabolism, 
it is fundamental to discern the metabolic effects induced by single and concomitant genetic events, in view of the potential exploitation of such 
metabolic dependencies for novel therapeutic interventions Using 13C-metabolic flux analysis, we demonstrated how isogenic NSCLC cells 
harbouring both KRAS/LKB1 alterations were able to exploit the central cellular metabolic routes through a heightened metabolite production 
compare to the single ones Further, to recognize such peculiar metabolic behaviour we performed in silico modelling on genome wide metabolic 
reconstruction Based on RNA-seq, metabolic enzymes abundance and composition of the medium and using flux balance analyses we predicted 
metabolic changes The observed differences in metabolites production were correlated with experimental observations supporting that the 
enhanced metabolic activity of cells with both genetic lesions rendered the viability of these cells more susceptible to energetic stress such as 
glycolysis inhibition and/or nutrients limitation than those harboring single lesions This observation raises the prospect that energy stress may 
affect NSCLC cells harbouring co-occurring lesions, which may render them more susceptible to cytotoxic drugs

Comprehensive evaluation of a one-step sample preparation for global LC-MS lipidomics of cancer cell cultures
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Gillian Mackay, CRUK Beatson Institute, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Giovanny Rodriguez-Blanco, Victor H Villar, David Sumpton
Lipidomics aims to provide a global analysis of all lipid species present in biological samples Lipids play an important role in cell membrane 
integrity, energy storage, and cell signalling, all of which are relevant in cancer development and progression Standard methods in lipidomics 
profiling of cell cultures involve biphasic separation using organic solvents such as chloroform or methyl tert-butyl ether to extract the lipids, 
followed by evaporation and reconstitution in an LC-MS compatible solvent Some technical issues can arise using this biphasic extraction and 
reconstitution: we experienced issues with reproducibility between biological replicates and inaccuracy in our normalisation to protein content, 
an important parameter when comparing cells growing at different rates In this study, we propose a rapid single step procedure involving 
simultaneous lipid extraction and protein precipitation from cell culture plates using either isopropanol (IPA) or a mixture of 1:1 butanol/methanol 
(BuMe) To evaluate the extraction efficiency of IPA and BuMe compared with chloroform/methanol, HepG2 (liver cancer) cells were grown in a 
standard medium, in a lipid-rich medium and after treatment with a DGAT inhibitor, inhibiting triacylglycerol biosynthesis Our LC method and mass 
spectrometry parameters were addressed, as were various methods and software for data analysis We compared global changes in lipid classes, 
differences in lipid intensities and the effect of the DGAT inhibitor, with the three different extraction procedures

Mevalonate pathway is an important metabolic pathway which plays a key role in multiple cellular processes In recent years the mevalonate 
pathway has become a challenging and, in the meantime, fascinating topic, when a large number of experimental and clinical studies suggested 
that inhibition of nonsterol isoprenoids might have valuable interest in human pathology These molecules that are essential for cell growth 
and differentiation appear to be potential interesting therapeutic targets for many areas of ongoing research: oncology, autoimmune disorders, 
atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease Thus, functional understanding of their biosynthesis is important key However, available methods do not 
yet allow accurate quantification and tracing of stable isotopes incorporation for all the isoprenoids precursors (mevalonate intermediates and 
prenyl pyrophosphates) We present a complete methodology for functional analysis of isoprenoids biosynthesis, with a novel quantification method 
based on liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry This workflow covers all the experimental and computational 
steps from sample collection and preparation to data acquisition and processing It ensures accurate, absolute quantification (RSD < 20 %) of 
all mevalonate and prenyl pyrophosphates intermediates with a high sensitivity over a large linear range (from 01 to 50 pmol) Determination of 
their isotopologue distributions in isotopic labeling experiments was performed, opening the way for 13C-metabolic flux analysis of isoprenoids 
biosynthesis In conclusion, the described methodology fills one of the last technical gaps for functional studies of isoprenoids biosynthesis and 
should be applicable to other eukaryotic and prokaryotic (micro)organisms after adaptation of some organism-dependent steps

CO-AUTHORS: Jiaqi Huang, Stephanie Weinstein, Joshua Sampson, Christopher Haiman, Loic Le Marchand, Tracy Layne
African-American men are under-studied in prostate cancer research despite having substantially higher disease incidence compared to other 
races Recent prospective studies conducted primarily among men of European ancestry identified several plasma/serum metabolites associated 
with prostate cancer risk, including lipids (fatty acids, acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins, inositols, glycerphospholipids, and androgens), dipeptides and 
gamma-glutamyl amino acids, nucleotides, TCA cycle compounds and antioxidants We examined the prospective serum metabolomic profile of 
prostate cancer risk in African-Americans in order to elucidate possible biological mechanisms underlying their greater disease burden We meta-
analyzed two case-control studies nested within the Multiethnic Cohort and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial cohort 
(592 cases/592 controls, matched on age, study center, and blood collection date) Samples were analyzed using ultrahigh performance liquid 
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Metabolon, Inc) that identified 997 known compounds Conditional logistic regression estimated 
ORs and 95% CIs for 1-sd increments in metabolite levels that were meta-analyzed using a fixed-effects model Median time from serum collection 
to diagnosis was 5 years (maximum 19 years) Metabolites showing the strongest associations with prostate cancer risk (FDR q-value=02) were 
p-cresol glucuronide (1-sd OR 080, p=000045), hypotaurine (1-sd OR 125, p=00006), p-cresol sulfate (1-sd OR 081, p=000078), indolin-2-
one (1-sd OR 081, p=000084), asparagine (1-sd OR 123, p=0001), indole-3-carboxylic acid (1-sd OR 080, p=0002), and taurine (1-sd OR 
121, p=0002) The metabolomic profile of prostate cancer risk in this investigation of black men suggests an etiologic role for microbiota-related 
metabolites that differs substantially from metabolites previously identified in populations of European ancestry

Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constituting about 85% of all LC 
cases Recently positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) is actively used to study LC Measurement of 2-deoxy-
2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose uptake by tumor reflects its increased rate of aerobic glycolysis Among others, PET/MRI provides information about
