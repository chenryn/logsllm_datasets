**Background:** Early-life exposures are believed to play a significant etiological role in the development of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, direct analysis of these exposures has been limited due to technological barriers. Archived neonatal blood spots (NBS) collected within the first days of life offer a means to investigate small molecules that reflect early-life exposures and biological responses preceding the onset of clinical disease.

**Methods:** We obtained NBS for 334 ALL cases and 324 healthy matched controls as part of the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Untargeted metabolomics was performed on the extracts of NBS punches (4.7-mm, ~8 µL of blood) using an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system connected to a 6550 QTOF HRMS (Santa Clara, USA) in ESI (-) mode. Subjects were stratified by early (1-5 years) and late (6-14 years) diagnosis, and an ensemble of feature-selection methods was used to pinpoint metabolites predictive of case status. Covariates representing suspected risk factors for ALL were also evaluated.

**Results:** Mutually exclusive sets of lipids and fatty acids were associated with ALL phenotypes, including 9 and 19 metabolites in the early- and late-diagnosis groups, respectively. In the late-diagnosis group, a prominent cluster of metabolites contained molecules with 18:2 fatty-acid chains, suggesting that newborn exposure to the essential nutrient, linoleic acid, increased ALL risk. Notably, the abundances of these 18:2 lipids were greater in infants who were fed formula rather than breast milk (colostrum) and increased with the mother’s pre-pregnancy body mass index, indicating possible etiological roles of newborn nutrition.

**Conclusions:** This study provides evidence that maternal and neonatal nutrition, particularly exposure to linoleic acid, may be a risk factor for childhood leukemia. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.

**Presenting Author:** Danuta Dudzik, Medical University of Gdańsk, Poland  
**Co-Authors:** Danuta Dudzik, Irving W. Wainer, Wiktoria Struck-Lewicka, Małgorzata Waszczuk-Jankowska, Michał J. Markuszewski, Michel Bernier, Danuta Siluk

**Background:** Metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The clinical management is challenging due to CRC's innate and/or acquired multidrug resistance to standard and targeted chemotherapies, as well as resistance to immuno-oncology approaches.

**Methods:** We studied the anticancer effects of 4’-methoxy-1-naphthylfenoterol (MNF) acting through the inhibition of G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 and activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor. Female BALB/c mice with subcutaneous CT26 CRC tumors were divided into three experimental groups: (R,R’)-MNF at 20 mg/kg (n=9) or 30 mg/kg (n=8), and a vehicle-treated control (n=10). Plasma and tumor metabolomic profiles were evaluated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC-ESI-TOF-MS). Raw data were pre-processed, filtered, and corrected for signal drift. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to evaluate the drug effect on CRC. Metabolite annotation was accomplished by searching against several databases, including HMDB, KEGG, Metlin, and LipidMaps.

**Results:** Among the most differentiated metabolites significantly impacted by MNF were those belonging to the lipid metabolism pathway, including glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, and sterol lipids. These results are consistent with our previous data reporting MNF activity in pancreatic cancer.

**Conclusions:** This study advances our understanding of the anticancer molecular mechanisms of MNF and highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent for metastatic CRC. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the clinical applications of MNF.

**Presenting Author:** Ralf Loescher, LECO European Application and Technology Center, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** David E. Alonso, Joe Binkley, Habtom Ressom, Cristina Di Poto

**Background:** High mortality rates exist for individuals with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is a critical need for the discovery of early-stage HCC biomarkers to enable rapid and effective treatments. GC-MS-based metabolomics is an ideal approach for investigating cancer physiology and identifying liver disease diagnostic markers.

**Methods:** The objective of this research was to implement an untargeted, multiplatform analytical approach for the identification of candidate HCC biomarkers in humans using comprehensive GC- and GCxGC-TOFMS. After sample preparation, dry samples were derivatized in two steps: methoximation and silylation. Derivatized samples and quality control standards were injected into the chromatograph, and separation was performed using two different polarity columns. Mass spectra were collected using a mass range of 50 to 510 and an acquisition rate of 10 spectra per second (200 sps for GCxGC). Data were processed using untargeted Peak Find, and compounds were characterized through retention index filtering, similarity searches, and formula determinations.

**Results:** Analyses of plasma samples resulted in composition maps displaying a wide variety of compounds, including acids, diacids, amino acids, bases, fatty acids, simple sugars, and reduced/oxidized sugars. Transitioning from GC-TOFMS to high-performance GCxGC-TOFMS resulted in a more than two-fold increase in characterized compounds. Statistical processing of the data led to the identification of potential candidate markers for HCC, including organic acids, amino acids, and reduced sugars.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the potential of GC- and GCxGC-TOFMS in the discovery of HCC biomarkers. Future work will focus on the validation of these biomarkers in larger cohorts and their integration into clinical practice.

### P-31: Volatile Organic Compounds as Biomarkers of Prognosis in Palliative Lung Cancer Patients

**Presenting Author:** Elinor Chapman, Palliative Care Institute Liverpool, University of Liverpool, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** David Hughes, John Ellershaw, Mark Boyd, Chris Probert, Seamus Coyle

**Background:** Diagnosing dying and predicting prognosis for palliative patients remains a challenge due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. We hypothesize that there is a metabolic process to dying that could yield quantifiable biomarkers.

**Methods:** A feasibility study showed that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urine changed in the last days and weeks of life in a small mixed cancer group. In this pilot study, 424 urine samples were collected from 162 patients with advanced lung cancer from six sites across Merseyside. Sixty-three patients provided a sample in the last month (28 days) of life, and 29 patients in the last week of life. Urinary VOCs were examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to analyze the data and create models.

**Results:** A model predicting whether an individual would die within three days based on only two VOCs generated an AUC = 0.80 (0.68-0.93), with 93% specificity and 68% sensitivity. Other models predicting between 4-10 days of life or 11-17 days of life remaining were also generated.

**Conclusions:** Urine analysis could be used to predict the dying process and lead to the identification of prognostic biomarkers. Future work will focus on optimizing urinary VOC analysis, refining models, and verifying them in a validation cohort of patients with lung and other cancers.

### P-32: Metabolic Alterations in Patients with Cancer: Searching for Metabolomic Biomarkers of Breast Cancer

**Presenting Author:** Matea Nikolac Perkovic, CEMBIO, University San Pablo CEU (Madrid, Spain); Ruđer Bošković Institute (Zagreb, Croatia), Spain  
**Co-Authors:** David Rojo Blanco, Marija Kirzic, Natalija Dedic Pavletic, Kamelija Zarkovic, Damir Vrbanec, Biserka Orehovec, Coral Barbas, Neven Zarkovic

**Background:** Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease and one of the major causes of cancer death in women. One hallmark of cancer is the ability of cancer cells to alter their metabolic phenotype, which allows them to survive and proliferate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to apply an LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics approach to identify new metabolomic biomarkers associated with BC pathology.

**Methods:** The study included plasma samples from BC patients prior to any treatment (N=41) and matching controls (N=30). Fifty-seven chemical compounds were found to be significantly altered in BC patients. The resulting list of statistically significant accurate masses was annotated using the CEU Mass Mediator search tool, and the biological role of suggested compounds was additionally evaluated to exclude less probable identification matches.

**Results:** Our results indicate a significant increase in the expression of different fatty acyls, including straight chain, branched, and unsaturated fatty acids, docosanoids, eicosanoids, octadecanoids, fatty aldehydes, and amides. Increased levels of certain monoacylglycerols and different glycerophospholipids were also characteristic of BC subjects. We also detected alterations in amino acid and bilirubin metabolism in BC patients and differential expression of C19 and C20 steroids.

**Conclusions:** These findings suggest a key role of lipid classes and molecular species in BC growth and development and bring us closer to new metabolomic biomarkers in BC. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.

### P-33: Investigating the Drug Responsiveness on the Metabolic Pathways in PDAC-PDX Models

**Presenting Author:** Adja Zoumaro-Djayoon, Leiden University, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Diana Behrens, Amy Harms, Thomas Hankemeier

**Background:** Despite progress in identifying molecular alterations related to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), effective treatments are still lacking to reduce the high mortality rate. New concepts and methods are required to find better drug targets and early diagnostic markers. We used metabolomics to investigate the effects of anti-cancer drugs gemcitabine, abraxane (Nab-paclitaxel), and erlotinib on the metabolism of newly developed patient-derived xenografts (PDX).

**Methods:** Targeted metabolomics platforms covering major metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, central metabolism, lipids, amino acids, and signaling lipids (inflammatory mediators), were applied to treated and non-treated tumor tissues from PDX of two patients. The comparison between the metabolomic profiles of treated and untreated models revealed changes in the metabolic profiles.

**Results:** In xenografts derived from one patient, abraxane treatment significantly decreased the levels of amino acids and increased the levels of lipid metabolites, while an increase in the level of sphingomyelins was observed with gemcitabine treatment. However, no significant changes were observed in the metabolic profiles of the second patient upon treatment.

**Conclusions:** Our findings contribute to the understanding of oncogenic mechanisms in PDAC and improve the monitoring of treatments in this cancer. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical applications.

### P-34: The Effects of Omega-3 Supplementation on the Brain Lipidome after Chemotherapy

**Presenting Author:** Rachel Kopec, The Ohio State University, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Djawed Bennouna, Melissa Solano, Tonya S. Orchard, Maryam B. Lustberg, A. Courtney DeVries

**Background:** Breast cancer chemotherapy agents negatively affect long-term brain functioning in some breast cancer survivors. Neuroinflammatory damage may play a role in changing brain structure or altering signaling, resulting in cognitive impairment. We hypothesized that a diet enriched with long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) would result in a greater inflammation-resolving response mediated by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) and reduce oxidation of hippocampal brain lipids.

**Methods:** Ovariectomized C57BL/6 mice were fed a diet with or without 2% n-3 PUFA enrichment for 4-6 weeks, followed by a two-injection chemotherapy or vehicle regimen. In Study 1, animals (n=120) were sacrificed at 4, 7, and 14 days after the last injection, and targeted HPLC-MS/MS analyses quantitated SPMs in whole brain. In Study 2, animals (n=80) were sacrificed 7 days after the last injection, and untargeted LC-HRMS lipidomics were performed on the hippocampus.

**Results:** SPM resolvin D1 was quantifiable in all samples regardless of treatment or dietary group, but no differences were observed. PLS-DA modeling revealed approximately 500 metabolites driving significant separation between the n-3 PUFA-supplemented and non-supplemented animals (R2=0.67, Q2=0.64, P-value=0.014), and this dietary effect was greater than the effect of chemotherapy 7 days post-treatment. Identification of distinguishing lipids is ongoing.

**Conclusions:** The results suggest that other, non-inflammatory pathways are likely involved in driving the separation between lipids. Further research is needed to identify and validate these pathways and explore their clinical implications.

### P-35: Urine-NMR Metabolomics for Screening of Advanced Colorectal Adenoma and Early-Stage Colorectal Cancer

**Presenting Author:** Hyuk Nam Kwon, University of Helsinki, Finland  
**Co-Authors:** Eun Ran Kim, Hoonsik Nam, Jae J. Kim, Sunghyouk Park, Young-Ho Kim

**Background:** Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is considered one of the most preventable cancers, no non-invasive, accurate diagnostic tool exists for screening. We explored the potential of urine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics as a diagnostic tool for early detection of CRC, focusing on advanced adenoma and stage 0 CRC.

**Methods:** Urine metabolomic profiles from patients with colorectal neoplasia (CRN; 36 advanced adenomas and 56 CRCs at various stages, n=92) and healthy controls (normal, n=156) were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Healthy and CRN groups were statistically discriminated using orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The class prediction model was validated by three-fold cross-validation. Advanced adenoma and stage 0 CRC were grouped together as pre-invasive CRN.

**Results:** The OPLS-DA score plot showed statistically significant discrimination between pre-invasive CRN, advanced CRC, and healthy controls with a Q2 value of 0.746. In the prediction validation study, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing pre-invasive CRN were 96.2% and 95%, respectively. The areas under the curve for taurine, alanine, and 3-aminoisobutyrate were 0.823, 0.783, and 0.842, respectively. Multiple receiver operating characteristics curve analyses indicated that taurine, alanine, and 3-aminoisobutyrate were good discriminators for CRC patients.

**Conclusions:** NMR-based urine metabolomics profiles significantly and accurately discriminate patients with pre-invasive CRN and advanced CRC from healthy individuals. Urine-NMR metabolomics has potential as a screening tool for the accurate diagnosis of pre-invasive CRN. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm these findings.

### P-36: Insight into the Metabolic Avidity in KRAS-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Flux Analysis and Biochemical Modeling

**Presenting Author:** Laura Brunelli, Istituto Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Italy  
**Co-Authors:** Ewelina Węglarz-Tomczak, Elisa Caiola, Mirko Marabese, Giovanna Sestito, Massimo Broggini, Hans Westerhoff, Roberta Pastorelli

**Background:** Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple oncogenic driver mutations. Currently, there are no successful treatments targeting NSCLC with KRAS mutations. Approximately half of the tumors with activating KRAS genetic lesions also have serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1) deletions or inactivating mutations. The presence of LKB1 loss in KRAS-mutant tumors may represent a significant source of heterogeneity and contribute to poor responses to therapy.

**Methods:** Using 13C-metabolic flux analysis, we demonstrated how isogenic NSCLC cells harboring both KRAS/LKB1 alterations exploit central cellular metabolic routes through heightened metabolite production compared to single-lesion cells. To recognize such peculiar metabolic behavior, we performed in silico modeling on genome-wide metabolic reconstruction. Based on RNA-seq, metabolic enzyme abundance, and medium composition, we predicted metabolic changes using flux balance analysis.

**Results:** The observed differences in metabolite production correlated with experimental observations, supporting that the enhanced metabolic activity of cells with both genetic lesions rendered their viability more susceptible to energetic stress, such as glycolysis inhibition and/or nutrient limitation, compared to those with single lesions.

**Conclusions:** This observation raises the prospect that energy stress may affect NSCLC cells harboring co-occurring lesions, making them more susceptible to cytotoxic drugs. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical implications.

### P-37: Comprehensive Evaluation of a One-Step Sample Preparation for Global LC-MS Lipidomics of Cancer Cell Cultures

**Presenting Author:** Gillian Mackay, CRUK Beatson Institute, United Kingdom  
**Co-Authors:** Giovanny Rodriguez-Blanco, Victor H. Villar, David Sumpton

**Background:** Lipidomics aims to provide a global analysis of all lipid species present in biological samples. Lipids play crucial roles in cell membrane integrity, energy storage, and cell signaling, all of which are relevant in cancer development and progression. Standard methods in lipidomics profiling of cell cultures involve biphasic separation using organic solvents, followed by evaporation and reconstitution in an LC-MS compatible solvent. However, technical issues can arise, such as reproducibility and normalization to protein content.

**Methods:** In this study, we propose a rapid single-step procedure involving simultaneous lipid extraction and protein precipitation from cell culture plates using either isopropanol (IPA) or a mixture of 1:1 butanol/methanol (BuMe). To evaluate the extraction efficiency of IPA and BuMe compared with chloroform/methanol, HepG2 (liver cancer) cells were grown in a standard medium, a lipid-rich medium, and after treatment with a DGAT inhibitor, inhibiting triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Our LC method and mass spectrometry parameters were optimized, and various methods and software for data analysis were compared.

**Results:** We compared global changes in lipid classes, differences in lipid intensities, and the effect of the DGAT inhibitor with the three different extraction procedures. The one-step extraction methods (IPA and BuMe) showed comparable or superior performance to the traditional biphasic extraction in terms of lipid recovery and reproducibility.

**Conclusions:** This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a one-step sample preparation method for global LC-MS lipidomics of cancer cell cultures. The proposed method offers a simpler and more efficient alternative to traditional biphasic extraction, with potential applications in large-scale lipidomics studies.

### P-38: Investigation of Mevalonate Pathway by Quantitative Metabolomics and Isotopologue Profiling

**Presenting Author:** Floriant Bellvert, MetaToul-MetaboHUB, France  
**Co-Authors:** Hanna Kulyk-Barbier, Sara Castano-Cerezo, Pierre Millard, Jean-Charles Portais, Stéphanie Heux, Gilles Truan, Floriant Bellvert

**Background:** The mevalonate pathway plays a key role in multiple cellular processes. Recent studies have suggested that inhibition of nonsterol isoprenoids might have therapeutic potential in human pathologies, including oncology, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. Functional understanding of isoprenoid biosynthesis is crucial, but current methods do not allow accurate quantification and tracing of stable isotopes incorporation for all isoprenoid precursors.

**Methods:** We present a complete methodology for functional analysis of isoprenoid biosynthesis, including a novel quantification method based on liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. This workflow covers all experimental and computational steps from sample collection and preparation to data acquisition and processing. It ensures accurate, absolute quantification (RSD < 20%) of all mevalonate and prenyl pyrophosphates intermediates with high sensitivity over a large linear range (from 0.1 to 50 pmol). Determination of their isotopologue distributions in isotopic labeling experiments was performed, opening the way for 13C-metabolic flux analysis of isoprenoid biosynthesis.

**Results:** The described methodology fills a significant technical gap for functional studies of isoprenoid biosynthesis and is applicable to other eukaryotic and prokaryotic (micro)organisms after adaptation of some organism-dependent steps.

**Conclusions:** This study provides a robust and comprehensive method for the investigation of the mevalonate pathway, enabling detailed functional analysis and potential therapeutic target identification. Further research is needed to validate and expand the application of this methodology.

### P-39: Prospective Serum Metabolomic Profile of Prostate Cancer Risk in African-Americans from Two U.S. Cohorts

**Presenting Author:** Demetrius Albanes, U.S. National Cancer Institute, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Jiaqi Huang, Stephanie Weinstein, Joshua Sampson, Christopher Haiman, Loic Le Marchand, Tracy Layne

**Background:** African-American men are under-studied in prostate cancer research despite having substantially higher disease incidence compared to other races. Recent prospective studies conducted primarily among men of European ancestry identified several plasma/serum metabolites associated with prostate cancer risk, including lipids, dipeptides, and gamma-glutamyl amino acids.

**Methods:** We examined the prospective serum metabolomic profile of prostate cancer risk in African-Americans to elucidate possible biological mechanisms underlying their greater disease burden. We meta-analyzed two case-control studies nested within the Multiethnic Cohort and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial cohort (592 cases/592 controls, matched on age, study center, and blood collection date). Samples were analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Metabolon, Inc.) that identified 997 known compounds. Conditional logistic regression estimated ORs and 95% CIs for 1-s.d. increments in metabolite levels, which were meta-analyzed using a fixed-effects model.

**Results:** Median time from serum collection to diagnosis was 5 years (maximum 19 years). Metabolites showing the strongest associations with prostate cancer risk (FDR q-value=0.2) were p-cresol glucuronide (1-s.d. OR 0.80, p=0.00045), hypotaurine (1-s.d. OR 1.25, p=0.0006), p-cresol sulfate (1-s.d. OR 0.81, p=0.00078), indolin-2-one (1-s.d. OR 0.81, p=0.00084), asparagine (1-s.d. OR 1.23, p=0.001), indole-3-carboxylic acid (1-s.d. OR 0.80, p=0.002), and taurine (1-s.d. OR 1.21, p=0.002).

**Conclusions:** The metabolomic profile of prostate cancer risk in African-American men suggests an etiologic role for microbiota-related metabolites, differing substantially from metabolites previously identified in populations of European ancestry. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.

**Presenting Author:** Michal Ciborowski, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland  
**Co-Authors:** Joanna Kisluk, Tomasz Kowalczyk, Ewa Sierko, Joanna Reszec, Malgorzata Mojsak, Karolina Pietrowska, Joanna Godzien, Adam Kretowski, Jacek Niklinski

**Background:** Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constituting about 85% of all LC cases. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) is actively used to study LC. Measurement of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose uptake by the tumor reflects its increased rate of aerobic glycolysis.

**Methods:** We aimed to correlate metabolomics data with PET/MRI imaging data of NSCLC patients. Metabolomic profiles were obtained using high-resolution mass spectrometry, and PET/MRI data were analyzed for glucose uptake and other metabolic parameters. The correlation between metabolomic and imaging data was assessed using statistical and bioinformatics tools.

**Results:** The integration of metabolomic and imaging data revealed distinct metabolic signatures associated with NSCLC. Key metabolites, including glucose, lactate, and specific amino acids, showed strong correlations with PET/MRI parameters. These findings provide insights into the metabolic reprogramming of NSCLC and highlight potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

**Conclusions:** Radiometabolomics offers a powerful approach to integrate metabolic and imaging data, providing a comprehensive view of NSCLC. This combined approach can enhance the understanding of tumor biology and aid in the development of personalized treatment strategies. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore their clinical applications.
