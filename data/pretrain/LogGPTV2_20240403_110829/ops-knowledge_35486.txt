**Problem:**
I am trying to run a Python script from the command line (bash) and would like to open a new console window, execute my script, and then enter the interactive Python shell. Is there an easy way to achieve this?

**Background:**
Currently, I am exploring Sublime Text 2 by developing a simple Python script that uses NumPy. When I run the build from within Sublime Text, the script executes, but I do not have the opportunity to interact with the results further.

**Solution:**
If you are using Python 3.2 or later, you can use the Python debugger (pdb) to achieve this. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Import pdb:** At the beginning of your script, add `import pdb`.
2. **Set a breakpoint:** Place `pdb.set_trace()` at the point in your script where you want to enter the interactive mode. Make sure to place this line before the last line of your script, as the program will otherwise finish and exit.
3. **Run the script:** Execute your script from the command line. When the script reaches the `pdb.set_trace()` line, it will pause and enter the debugger.
4. **Enter interactive mode:** Type `interact` and press Enter. This will drop you into an interactive Python shell, preserving all the variables and state of your script.

By following these steps, you can run your script and then interact with the results in the Python shell.
