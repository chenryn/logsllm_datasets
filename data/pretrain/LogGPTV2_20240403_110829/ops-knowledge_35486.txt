User: Here is my problem: When running a python script from command line (bash), I'd like to open a new console window, run my python script and end up in the interactive python shell. Is there an easy way to do this?
Background: Right now, I am exploring sublime text 2 by developing a simple python script together with numpy. When I run build from within sublime, the script is executed but I do not have the possibility to further interact with the result.
Assistant: If you're using python 3.2 you can use the python debugger. At the beginning of your project, import pdb. Then at the point that you want to enter interactive mode, type pdb.set_trace(). (You have to put the trace one line above the last line, otherwise the program will finish and restart.) I don't know how to make it automatically enter interactive mode, but when the program gets to the trace the console will enter the debugger. You can then type interact, and press Enter, and you will be in interactive mode, with all your variables preserved.
