User: I just wrote a function on Python. Then, I wanted to make it module and install on my Ubuntu 11.04. Here is what I did.

Created setup.py along with function.py file.
Built distribution file using $Python2.7 setup.py sdist
Then installed it $Python2.7 setup.py install

All was going fine. But, later I wanted to use the module importing it on my code.
I got import error: ImportError: No module named '-------'
PS. I searched over google and didn't find particular answer. Detailed answer will be much appreciated.
Assistant: Most installation requires:
sudo python setup.py install
Otherwise, you won't be able to write to the installation directories.
I'm pretty sure that (unless you were root), you got an error when you did
python2.7 setup.py install
