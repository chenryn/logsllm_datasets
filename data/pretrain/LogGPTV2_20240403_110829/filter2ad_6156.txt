ABSTRACT
Mobile devices such as smartphones and Internet-capable
tablets have achieved computing and networking capabili-
ties comparable to traditional personal computers. Their
successful consumerization has also become a source of pain
for adopting users and organizations. The operating systems
supporting these new devices have both advantages and dis-
advantages with respect to oﬀered security. On one hand,
they use application sandboxing to contain exploits and limit
privileges given to malware. On the other hand, they collect
and organize many forms of security- and privacy-sensitive
information simply as a matter of operation, and make that
information easily accessible to downloaded third-party ap-
plications.
Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as the emerg-
ing area, this workshop intends to provide a venue for inter-
ested researchers and practitioners to get together and ex-
change ideas, thus to deepen our understanding to various
security and privacy issues on smartphones, speciﬁcally the
platforms such as iOS and Android. To this end, the work-
shop solicits both technical and position paper submissions
with a variety of relevant topics and further strongly encour-
ages novel paradigms and controversial ideas. With strong
engagement from our community, the workshop emerges as a
vibrant venue for creative debate and interaction in security-
and privacy-sensitive areas of computing and communica-
tion broadly impacted by smartphones and mobile devices.

INTRODUCTION
Recent years have witnessed a meteoric increase in the
adoption of smartphones and mobile devices.
In fact, the
year of 2011 marks as the ﬁrst time in history that smart-
phones have outsold personal computers. Inarguably, their
popularity can be partially attributed to the incredible func-
tionality and convenience smartphones and mobile devices
oﬀered to end users: They are no longer basic devices for
making phone calls and receiving SMS messages, but pow-
erful communication and entertainment platforms for web
surﬁng, social networking, GPS navigation, and online bank-
ing. Also, latest-generation mobile devices have achieved
computing and networking capabilities that are comparable
to traditional personal computers.
While commodity mainstream mobile platforms, includ-
ing Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, indeed provide in-
credible features and are accompanied with enormous appli-
cations for mobile users to conveniently browse and down-
load, their consumerization success, unfortunately, has also
become a source of pain for adopting users and organiza-
tions. For example, the wide-spread presence of information-
stealing mobile applications (or ”apps”) and other types of
malicious software raises substantial security and privacy
concerns. Speciﬁcally, the presence of centralized market-
places or app stores may greatly streamline the process of
mobile app browsing, downloads and installation and thus
boost smartphone popularity. However, the very same cen-
tralized marketplace model could also signiﬁcantly “contribute”
to speedy mobile malware infection possibly within a short
time period.
Existing mainstream mobile platforms are not perfect.
The operating systems supporting these new devices have
both advantages and disadvantages with respect to oﬀered
security. On one hand, they use application sandboxing to
contain exploits and limit privileges given to malware. On
the other hand, they collect and organize many forms of
security- and privacy-sensitive information simply as a mat-
ter of operation, and make that information easily accessible
to downloaded third-party applications.
2. WORKSHOP GOALS
Recognizing smartphone security and privacy as an active
research area, this workshop intends to provide a vibrant
venue for interested researchers and practitioners to get to-
gether and exchange ideas, thus to deepen our understand-
ing to various security and privacy issues on smartphones
and mobile devices.
This workshop should appeal to both academia researchers
1062and industry practitioners from privacy and security com-
munity to present novel issues and techniques related to
smartphones and mobile devices. This workshop is intended
to address diﬀerent aspects related to the problem of access-
ing, transporting, and processing personal or sensitive infor-
mation stored in mobile devices. Another important ques-
tion is how to eﬀectively balance privacy (or security) and
usability, i.e., by improving privacy (or security) without
necessarily undermining usability and vice versa. The work-
shop naturally serves as a forum for the conﬂuence of new
and multidisciplinary ideas that will help to drive research in
the areas of privacy and security, embedded systems, human-
computer interface, and mobile computing. Researchers and
practitioners from respective research areas are considered
as target audiences for this workshop and are strongly in-
vited to submit their original papers in this workshop.
Aﬃliated with the ACM CCS main conference, this work-
shop has been successfully held once in last year. Speciﬁ-
cally, last year, we had 19 submissions, accepted 9 papers,
and have more than 80 registered attendees. By building
on the last year’s success, we will continue to actively so-
licit the participation of the workshop from researchers and
practitioners in academia, industry, and government agen-
cies and expect continued engagement from the community
with more submissions and attendees.
3. TOPICS OF INTEREST
All researchers and practitioners were encouraged to sub-
mit papers covering various security and privacy issues on
smartphones and mobile devices, speciﬁcally the platforms
such as iOS and Android. Topics of interests include, but
are not limited to, the following subject categories:
• Device/hardware security
• OS/Middleware security
• Application security
• Marketplace security
• Authenticating users to devices and services
4. WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION
The workshop will take a full day. It will consist of one
keynote presentation and a collection of research papers that
report latest research advances in smartphone security and
privacy. The keynote speech will be given by Geir Olsen,
who is a Principal Program Manager in the operating system
group on the Windows Phone team.
In that role, Geir is
responsible for the Windows Phone security model. His talk
will be on “Windows Phone 8 Security.”
For the paper solicitation, we welcome both full papers
that present relatively complete and mature research results
and short position papers that report work-in-progress but
inspiring and intriguing new ideas. The tentative program
is shown in Table 1.
We plan to continue last year’s tradition by having 15
minute back-to-back talks in each technical session followed
by 45 minutes discussion. The expected outcome is an en-
gaged discussion from the audience and presenters to better
reveal possible challenges and hopefully generate new in-
sights for improvements or solutions.

We would like to thank those institutions and individuals
who have made this workshop possible. Especially, we are
greatly thankful to our program committee. Without their
hard work, this workshop will simply not exist. This work-
shop is supported in part by NSF grants CNS-1139947 and
CNS-1245825.
