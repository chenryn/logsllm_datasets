Moreover, an AS is not an atomic entity; it is a network in its
own right. It is common for an AS to implement different policies
at different ingress point or towards different peers [36] resulting
in a situation such as shown in Figure 4 where measurement of
paths 𝐽 and 𝐾 present contradictory results. However, this is not
the same as in typical tomography problems where varying results
are interpreted as a stochastic process (e.g., a loss process) because
the impact on paths 𝐽 and 𝐾 is (approximately) constant per path,
just different between the paths.
3 NETWORK TOMOGRAPHY WITH BeCAUSe
In this section, we present our algorithmic framework – BeCAUSe
(BayEsian Computation for AUtonomous SystEms) – for inferring
the cause of path observations. We reframe the binary tomogra-
phy problem into this setting where pure binary choices are not
possible, and use computational Bayesian inference. We apply this
specifically to BGP in Section 5.1 using the data from the RFD
measurement infrastructure. We demonstrate the applicability of

measurement for each probe setting as in [10].

gather many possible values of 𝑝𝑖, and the associated likelihood
of producing the data we observe, to determine not only the most
likely value, but also some measure of certainty about our results.
The output distribution of all the 𝑝𝑖’s together given the data 𝐷,
denoted P(p|𝐷), is called the posterior distribution. The individual
distributions P(𝑝𝑖|𝐷) are called marginal distributions and will
provide information about which ASs are displaying our property
of interest.
The basic probabilistic model introduced in (5) mirrors the binary
tomography problem in § 2.3. The procedure can be generalised,
though, to other likelihood models. It could, for example, incorpo-
rate specific types of errors in the measurements.
The likelihood in (5) is a variant of the Poisson binomial distri-
bution and a closed form of P(p|𝐷) does not exist. Computational
Bayesian methods are required to sample from the posterior distri-
bution of interest.
3.2 Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a suite of com-
putational Bayesian methods that use a stochastic simulation to
approach complex inference problems. They are ideal when it is
easy to simulate potential solutions and calculate their likelihood,
but difficult to find the optimal solution, for example in the tomog-
raphy problems described above. As highlighted above, instead of a
single solution, we obtain many, in the form of a distribution, that
can be used to calculate quantities of interest. In the case of the
RFD problem we are estimating the RFD proportion of each node
and how confident we are in these estimates.
In general, MCMC methods are used to infer the distribution of
some set of parameters p, given some dataset 𝐷—in tomography
this will be the set of all measured paths (i.e., infer P(p|𝐷)). Using
Bayes rule converts this into the form required for inference.
P(p|𝐷) ∝ P(𝐷|p) · P(p),
(6)
where P(𝐷|p) is a likelihood model associated with the data as
described in (5) and P(p) is the prior distribution, incorporating
our knowledge of the parameters.
MCMC methods are designed to move around the space of pos-
sible solutions to the problem and take samples (i.e., possible solu-
tions) based on the associated likelihoods. The different methods to
move around the space give rise to an active research area. Here we
use two well known MCMC methods, Metropolis-Hastings [22, 25]
and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [4, 13]. These MCMC methods begin
with some underlying knowledge of the parameters of interest, the
prior distribution P(p). By using the information from the data,
𝐷, we update the likely values of each 𝑝𝑖 according to the model
likelihood, resulting in the posterior distribution P(p|𝐷). We can
also use a uniform distribution for the prior if there is no underlying
knowledge of the parameters.
Metropolis-Hastings (MH). The MH algorithm creates a Markov
chain to explore the space of interest P(p|𝐷). At each step a new
candidate for the probability vector p′ is randomly proposed using
the proposal distribution Q(p′|p) (satisfying technical conditions
[35]) conditioned on the current state p. The proposal p′ is accepted
or rejected in a Metropolis update step with probability given by

this algorithm to more general tomography problems by inferring
Route Origin Validation (ROV) in § 7.
3.1 Overview
We consider the binary property A of Autonomous Systems. Let
each AS have some proportion 𝑝𝑖 of routes to which it applies prop-
erty A. For example, a network operator may apply RFD only to a
particularly flappy set of customers, or have legacy configurations
in old equipment. We also define and often use the complementary
proportion 𝑞𝑖 = 1 − 𝑝𝑖. We can think of these as probabilities, but
they are subtly different from those used, for instance, in loss infer-
ence where it would indicate a probability of loss for an arbitrary
packet.
Presuming that each AS contributes independently to the likeli-
hood of RFD on a single path2 the probability that a single path 𝐽
does not have property A is
P(𝐽 does not show A) =
𝑞𝑖 .
(4)

𝑖∈𝐽
On the other hand, if any AS displays property A then the path will
show A. As several ASs could potentially display A, the probability
of any AS displaying the property is 1 minus the probability that
no ASs display A. These two cases define the likelihood model
for the observed dataset 𝐷 given the probability vector q of the
probabilities 𝑞𝑖 for each AS in D.
First consider the probability of a single path 𝐽,

describes the likelihood that we observe our data 𝐷 given the set
of values 𝑞𝑖 for the ASs under consideration.
A Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) would seek to find ˆq or
ˆp that maximises (5). However, as we are in a probabilistic setting
there is scope to instead infer the distribution of 𝑞𝑖 or 𝑝𝑖. That is,
2We are not presuming that ASs are independent. We are well aware that, for instance,
sibling ASs may have correlated policies. All we assume is that if a policy is not
ubiquitous within their AS, then their decision about which routes to filter is not based
on knowledge of the choices of their neighbours. This assumption is likely false in
some places, but much less so than the alternative interpretation simply for the reason
our technique is needed: in general, ASs share little of their internal business decision
making with competitors. Moreover the assumption is not needed at all for ASs that
have a uniform policy.

The acceptance probability 𝛼 is calculated by substituting (6) and
the choice of Q(p′|p).
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). HMC is related to Metropo-
lis Hastings but uses Hamiltonian dynamics to explore the space by
translating the density function of interest into a potential energy
function and including a momentum variable [4]. The method uses
a Markov Chain as in MH but new candidates are proposed by
propagating the current state along a Hamiltonian trajectory using
a Gaussian distributed momentum parameter. To obtain the sam-
ples of interest the auxiliary momentum parameters are ignored
(marginalised over). This allows for multidimensional updates and
allows the sampler to escape from local optima. HMC also uses a
Metropolis update, and the acceptance probability uses the ratio of
the auxiliary distribution of both the parameters of interest and the
momentum.

p(𝑡),
where p′ is generated from either the MH or HMC proposal and
𝛼 is the corresponding update probability. We invite the reader to
pursue [4] for a thorough discussion of MCMC methods.
Prior Distributions. To finalise the algorithm we must also de-
cide on a prior distribution P(p). This provides some flexibility of
the method to incorporate our knowledge about the measurement
system. In the RFD case, for example, we know that our Beacons do
not dampen routes (see § 4). If there is no background knowledge a
uniform (uninformative) distribution should be used.
The prior will dominate in cases where we do not have enough
data about the parameter. We tested a variety of standard priors
(e.g., the uniform and 𝛽 distributions) and found that there is suffi-
cient data in the BGP setting for most ASs, so the choice of prior
does not strongly influence the results. But a good choice of prior
does make quantifying the uncertainty of inferences easier.
BeCAUSe generates samples from our distribution of interest
using only a likelihood model, path measurements and the prior.
There is no requirement of ground truth for ‘training.’ Techniques
that require training are impractical here where there is little ground
truth data.
The level of certainty about the inferences are implicit in the
distributions and allows for informed decision making based on
the desired application. The samples from P(p|𝐷) can be used in
many different ways. In § 5, we highlight how they can be used to
identify RFD-enabled ASs, and in § 7, we confirm its validity for
RPKI Route Origin Validation (ROV).
4 RFD MEASUREMENT INFRASTRUCTURE
Controlled, active experiments have improved accuracy for net-
work tomography problems [1, 19, 32, 37, 40] as they leverage
well-defined input signals (e.g., oscillating prefixes) to provoke ob-
servable events (e.g., in BGP dumps). Using passive monitoring of
uncontrolled BGP events from route announcement feeds to infer

path and non-RFD path, and time until re-advertisement (r-
delta).
RFD deployment is not possible, because we need to know whether
updates were sent or not, in order to know whether updates were
damped.
We built an infrastructure that injects signals to stimulate route
flap damping, which then becomes visible in common BGP data
sets. We identify a clear signature for AS paths that include at least
one autonomous system deploying RFD.
4.1 Generating Oscillating Prefixes
We use two-phase BGP Beacons, which oscillate at different fre-
quencies on controlled schedules from geographically distributed
peers. We measure and analyse the resulting signals in BGP dumps
from common route collector projects while ignoring BGP update
churn created by non-RFD causes, e.g., MRAI. Adjusting the update
intervals allows us to explore different RFD deployment configura-
tions.
Two-phase BGP Beacons. These differ from previous BGP Bea-
cons in order to cover the full RFD mechanics. Constant rate an-
nouncements and withdrawals would cause RFD ASs to constantly
dampen Beacon prefixes, hiding further information on RFD pa-
rameters. Instead, we oscillate IP prefixes for specific periods of
time, then allow RFD routers to reset the damping penalty, which
will then cause re-advertisement of the Beacon prefixes. Therefore,
the Beacons have two phases, the Beacon pattern:
Burst: a sequence of alternating announcements and with-
drawals starting with a withdrawal and ending with an an-
nouncement.
Break: BGP announcements and withdrawals are paused.
When receiving Beacon announcements at vantage points, we need
to identify which Beacon event caused this announcement. Similar
to the RIPE Beacons [34], we encode the sending timestamps of our
RFD Beacons in the transitive BGP aggregator attribute.
The RFD signature. Our Beacons are carefully designed to create
a specific RFD penalty behavior resulting in a recognizable BGP
update signature if RFD has occurred anywhere on the path between
the Beacon router and the vantage point. Figure 5 shows the Beacon
pattern and the observed signature; first the announcements are
damped away (𝑡1 – 𝑡2 and 𝑡5 – 𝑡6), thereafter a quite delayed re-
announcement follows after the Reuse Threshold is reached (𝑡3
and 𝑡7). The latter is released, because the last BGP update was

an announcement during the Burst. In Section 4.2, we use this
signature to decide whether an RFD-enabled AS exists on a path.
Preventing interference because of MRAI. Minimum Route
Advertisement Interval (MRAI) [31] is another mechanism that
limits oscillating BGP updates. As MRAI induces a signal very
different from RFD—delaying updates at most n seconds, where n is
a configurable constant—it does not interfere with our recognition
of the RFD signature.
4.2 Path Labeling
We search for our RFD signature in passively collected BGP update
dumps of public route collector projects for each Beacon prefix and
label each path individually. Paths are cleaned by removing AS path
prepending and paths with loops were not present in our dataset.
For our temporal analysis of the signals we need to consider that any
BGP update will arrive at the vantage point only after a propagation
delay of the BGP message. To identify the re-advertisement (i.e., the
delayed resending of the last announcement from the preceding
the Burst phase), we argue that the time delta between the final
update from the Burst and the re-advertisement during the Break,
r-delta, must exceed the normal propagation time of the respective
prefix at this vantage point.
To define the minimum propagation time for a re-advertisement
(minimum r-delta), both the normal propagation delay for our Bea-
cons and common MRAI configurations need to be considered. The
propagation delay of our anchor prefixes is at most 1 minute (see
Section 4.3). At the time of this writing, there are no studies mea-
suring the values that are used to configure MRAI on the Internet,
but there is at least one vendor defaulting MRAI to 30 seconds.
Considering Cisco RFD default parameters, a prefix is suppressed
for at least 21 minutes, for Juniper even longer. Given these distinct
timescales, we find that setting the minimum propagation time for
the re-advertisements to 5 minutes clearly separates the signals.
After analyzing all pairs of Burst-and-Break for each path, we
arrive at a set of RFD paths and a set of non-RFD paths. To cope
with unexpected infrastructure failures such as session resets, we
label paths with RFD for which at least 90% of Burst-Break pairs
match the above requirements.
4.3 Setup
Configuration. We deploy seven Beacon sets, in Europe, South
and North America, Asia, and Africa and analyze all BGP dumps
from RIPE RIS [33], RouteViews [42], and Isolario [23].3 Beacons
are a maximum of two AS hops away from a Tier 1 provider. We
verified that our upstream networks do not use RFD and therefore
do not influence our measurements.
At each of our seven Beacon sites we announced four different
