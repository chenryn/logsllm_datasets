I took this example navbar from the Bootstrap docs page
(http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default) but I'm using an input-
group instead of a form-group inside navbar-form.
See example: http://jsfiddle.net/kaiku/DZQjR/
In Firefox 24, the search box displays at it should, but in Chrome 30 the
search box expands to the full width of the navbar.
Setting width: auto on .input-group-btn seemed to solve the problem in Chrome
and had no effect in FF, but this seems more like a hack.
Here's the line in question:
bootstrap/less/input-groups.less
Line 52 in 3f87bf4
|  width: 1%;
