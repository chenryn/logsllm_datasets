I have taken this example of a navigation bar from the Bootstrap documentation page (http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default). However, I am using an `input-group` instead of a `form-group` within the `navbar-form`.

You can view the example here: http://jsfiddle.net/kaiku/DZQjR/

In Firefox 24, the search box displays as expected. However, in Chrome 30, the search box expands to the full width of the navigation bar.

Setting `width: auto` on the `.input-group-btn` class appears to resolve the issue in Chrome and has no impact in Firefox. However, this solution feels more like a workaround rather than a proper fix.

The relevant line in the Bootstrap LESS file is:
- File: `bootstrap/less/input-groups.less`
- Line: 52
- Code: `width: 1%;`

Is there a more robust solution to address this inconsistency between browsers?
