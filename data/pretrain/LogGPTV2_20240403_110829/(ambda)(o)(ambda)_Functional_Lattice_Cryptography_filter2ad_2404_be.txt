Concretely, the largest empirical coefﬁcient 𝐵 should have a tail probability of no more
than, say, 2−13. Under the subgaussian model, the probability of obtaining a coefﬁcient of
magnitude more than 4𝐵 is therefore less than (2−13)42 = 2−208. Even under the weaker
subexponential model, the probability is at most (2−13)4 = 2−52.
7.4 Hardness Estimates
In this section we describe how we obtain hardness estimates for our challenges. There
are many different algorithmic approaches for attacking lattice problems like the approx-
imate Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and the Bounded Distance Decoding (BDD) prob-
lem, of which Ring-LWE/LWR are special cases. These include lattice-basis reduction
(e.g., [LLL82; Sch87; GNR10; CN11; MW16]), exponential-time and -space sieving or
Voronoi-based algorithms (e.g., [AKS01; NV08; MV10b; MV10a; Laa15; Agg+15]),
225
combinatorial and algebraic attacks [BKW03; AG11; Alb+14], and combinations thereof
(e.g., [How07]).
Because all the above approaches represent active areas of research and can be difﬁcult to
compare directly—especially because some require enormous memory—we do not attempt
to give precise estimates of “bits of security.” Instead, we follow the analysis approach
of [MR09; LP11; LN13; Alk+16] for (Ring-)LWE to derive two kinds of hardness estimates.
First, we give the approximate root-Hermite factor 𝛿 > 1 needed to solve each challenge
via lattice attacks. We use 𝛿 to classify each challenge into one of a few broad categories,
ranging from “toy” (very easy) to “very hard”(likely out of reach for nation-state attackers
using the best publicly known algorithms). Second, we estimate the smallest block size that
is sufﬁcient to solve the challenge using the BKZ algorithm [SE94; CN11].
In ﬁgures 7.1 and 7.2, we give a sample of the hardness estimates for our Ring-LWE/LWR
challenges, using the methods described below (speciﬁcally, Equations (7.4.1) and (7.4.2)).
The estimates for the complete list of challenges can be found in [CP16a].
7.4.1 Ring-LWE/LWR as BDD
A standard attack on Ring-LWE casts it as a Bounded Distance Decoding (BDD) problem
on a random lattice from a certain class. For a collection of ℓ Ring-LWE samples (𝑎𝑖 ∈
𝑅𝑞, 𝑏𝑖 = 𝑠 · 𝑎𝑖 + 𝑒𝑖 mod 𝑞𝑅∨) deﬁning ⃗𝑎 = (𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎ℓ), we consider the corresponding
“𝑞-ary” lattice
ℒ(⃗𝑎) := {⃗𝑣 ∈ (𝑅∨)ℓ : ∃ 𝑧 ∈ 𝑅∨ such that ⃗𝑣 = 𝑧 · ⃗𝑎 (mod 𝑞𝑅∨)}.
The vector ⃗𝑏 = (𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏ℓ) ≈ 𝑠·⃗𝑎 mod 𝑞𝑅∨ is then a BDD target that is close to an element
of ℒ(⃗𝑎), and the BDD error is ⃗𝑒 = (𝑒1, . . . , 𝑒ℓ), where each 𝑒𝑖 is distributed as the spherical
Gaussian 𝐷𝑟.

Table 7.1: Hardness estimates for a selection of our continuous Ring-LWE challenges, in
terms of approximate root-Hermite factors and smallest BKZ block size required to solve
them: 𝑟′ is the rescaled error parameter (subsection 7.4.1), 𝛿 is the root-Hermite factor
(subsection 7.4.2), and 𝜅 is the GSA factor (subsection 7.4.3). Hardness estimates for
our discrete Ring-LWE challenges (odd challenge IDs, with parameters identical to the
preceding even challenge ID) are essentially the same, but may be slightly larger due to the
extra round-off error.
