I have 3 nodes in my cluster and two are master cum data nodes and one node is
client node. When I issues stats api(_cluster/stats), I still see the count of
client as 0 even though its is up and working.
Below is the response of stats API

count: {  
total: 3,  
master_only: 0,  
data_only: 0,  
master_data: 2,
