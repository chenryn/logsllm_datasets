User: How to achieve global load balancing to improve application performance?
Assistant: Global Load Balancing (GLB) is a distributed system architecture that distributes visitor requests to the nearest data center or server to improve application performance. The following are several methods to achieve global load balancing: 1. Based on DNS resolution: use DNS resolution technology to route visitor requests to the nearest available server. 2. Based on IP Anycast: use IP Anycast technology to route visitor's request to the nearest available server. 3. Based on CDN (Content Distribution Network): Use CDN technology to cache application resources and distribute them to all parts of the world to reduce access delay. 4. Based on multi-regional deployment: deploy the application to multiple regions, and use the load balancer to distribute the visitor's request to the nearest server. 5. Based on the global load balancer: using a professional global load balancer can provide more efficient routing and load balancing services. Different methods use different technologies and tools, and which method to choose needs to consider factors such as the nature of the application, user distribution, budget, and effect.
