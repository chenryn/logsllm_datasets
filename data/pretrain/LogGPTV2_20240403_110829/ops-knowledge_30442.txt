User: For activation there is a script that activates a virtualenv from an already running python interpeter using execfile('C:/path/to/virtualev/Scripts/activate_this.py', dict(__file__='C:/path/to/virtualev/Scripts/activate_this.py')). However since I can still import packages that are not in the virtualenv from the current python script I am confused about how it works.
For deactivation there is no python script at all.
What should I do?
Assistant: at the command line, type the word 'deactivate'
