### Title: Bypassing Sandboxes for Fun at Botconf 2014

In recent years, malware sandboxes have become a standard tool for malware researchers. They have also found their place in the commercial sector as a new security device. As was the case with firewalls in the 1990s, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) in the early 2000s, and Web Application Firewalls (WAF) more recently, sandboxes are now being marketed as the latest "silver bullet" in threat detection. While they can be very useful in certain scenarios, they are not as foolproof as vendors often claim.

As with any security measure, sandboxes are subject to countermeasures. Bypassing sandbox detection has become a common feature in modern malware and droppers. There are many sandboxes available today, including open-source solutions like Malwr, which is based on Cuckoo, and closed-source options such as Anubis, Xandora, Comodo, and ThreatExpert. Additionally, there are commercial offerings like FireEye and BlueCoat.

In this presentation, we will explore the common techniques used by malware droppers to bypass sandbox detection. As part of my personal research, I have studied these evasion methods and discovered additional tricks that can be used to bypass some sandboxes. I will detail several effective techniques and conclude with a review of best practices to harden your sandboxes against these detection evasions.
