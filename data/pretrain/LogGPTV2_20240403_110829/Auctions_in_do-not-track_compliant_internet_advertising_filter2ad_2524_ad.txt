### Impact of User Clicks on Simulation Bias and Revenue

As previously mentioned, the more a user clicks on the same ad (represented by the transition from 0% to 100% from the top whisker to the bottom in the figure), the more the simulation becomes biased towards fewer clicks and, consequently, less revenue. It is important to note that only the top whisker remains unaffected by this simulation bias.

### Observations from Figure 3

The second observation from Figure 3 is the slight upward trend of the top whisker, indicating higher revenues as more stale information is used. This suggests a consistent trend of advertisers, as a whole, reducing their bids over time. The cause of this trend is currently unknown.

### Advertiser Perspective

Next, we turn to the advertiser perspective. We compute, for each ad, the fraction of auctions where the user-visible simulated ranking increased or decreased compared to the trace, and whether the ad became visible or invisible due to being ranked high enough or too low. Figure 4 plots the average of these numbers across all ads as a function of the staleness of bid information used.

We first observe that both increased and decreased ranks are roughly equal, averaging to nearly zero. The same is true for ads becoming visible or invisible. While this is consistent with the revenue change in Figure 3 averaging out to zero, it is worth noting that there are other ways the revenue could average out to zero while being unfair to advertisers. For instance, fewer increased ranks could be compensated by more cases where the ad became visible, resulting in zero revenue change but being unfair to the advertiser. Fortunately, this is not the case.

We also observe that the impact of staleness on rank changes is very small. It begins with around 12% of auctions for 1-minute stale data and quickly converges to around 16%. This high number is due to the cascade effect: if a single ad jumps from a low rank to a high rank, it causes all the ads in between to register a "change" in rank. A single change in bid can affect up to ten ads. However, the overall impact is minimal; the ad jumping from low to high might register a change of 10 ranks, while the other 10 ads would register a change of only 1 rank each (not captured in the graph). Overall, we found a median net change of 1 rank for every 820 auctions the ad participates in.

### Summary of Simulations

To summarize, based on extensive simulations across varying degrees of staleness and different user models, there is little impact on broker revenue and little impact on advertiser fairness compared to today's systems.

### Computing User Score

So far, we have assumed the existence of a user score \( U \) that, when multiplied by the quality score \( G \), produces the expected click probability at the client for a given ad. Because clicks are relatively rare, it may be difficult to estimate \( U \) at the client based purely on the click history. Therefore, we require that the broker anonymously and unlinkably gathers detailed click statistics from clients to improve click probability estimates at individual clients. In what follows, we outline an approach.

There are several measurable attributes \( X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_L\} \) at the client that may help in predicting click probability. These include the level of interest in the ad’s product or service, the quality of the match between the targeting and the user, the context of the webpage, and the user’s historic CTR. The idea is that each client reports this information anonymously to the broker for each ad viewed and clicked. These reports contain: {Ad-ID, \( X \), click}, where \( X \) is the values of the attributes, and 'click' indicates whether or not the ad was clicked. Given this information from many clients, the broker can determine the effect of the attributes on click probability and convey this information to the client as a function \( f \) of the attributes such that \( U = f(X) \), along with the ad. This allows the client to compute \( U \) by measuring the attributes and plugging them into the provided function.

As mentioned, \( U \) in RaC can be computed at viewing time with the latest set of attributes without churn issues since that is when the ranking takes place. The function \( f \) for a new ad can be initially set to that of similar existing ads until enough data for the new ad is gathered. The details of this are left as future work.

### Privacy Concerns

One concern is that the set of attribute values \( X \) is unique for a given user. Several factors can mitigate this concern:
1. The attributes may be fairly coarse-grained, broadening the set of users to which they apply.
2. Some attributes may be hard to correlate using external knowledge, such as the user’s CTR.
3. Attributes like level of interest change over time and within interests, making them hard to link to the same user.
4. Some attributes are not specific to the user, such as webpage context.
5. The only information beyond the attribute values that is leaked is the ad viewed. The user’s click-stream is not exposed.

We believe it is reasonable to establish public policies that determine the nature of the attributes in such a way that meaningful privacy is preserved.

### Related Work

There is a substantial body of work on cryptographic protocols for privacy-preserving auctions. Depending on the underlying security model, these proposals can be classified into three categories:
1. Protocols that rely on distributed computation among auctioneers using threshold multi-party computation (e.g., [14, 15, 22]).
2. Protocols that introduce a semi-trusted third party, aka an “auction issuer” or “auction authority,” and use asymmetric multi-party computation techniques, such as Yao’s garbled circuit (e.g., [1, 2, 5, 19, 21]).
3. Protocols that allow bidders to cooperatively compute the auction outcome without relying on any trusted third party (e.g., [3, 4]).

The primary goal of these proposals is to keep bids and selling prices secret from the auctioneer and other participants. Our problem is different, focusing on protecting the user rather than the bidder (i.e., advertiser). The high computational and communication complexity of secure auction protocols makes them impractical for our problem.

### Summary and Future Directions

This paper addresses the challenge of designing an online advertising auction for a non-tracking advertising system that leverages user profile information while keeping the user profile private. We explore the design space, proposing three types of auctions and analyzing their properties with respect to privacy, auction quality, and vulnerability to attack. Overall, we find that two of the systems, Rank-at-Client (RaC) and Rank-at-3rd-Party (Ra3), are very acceptable designs. RaC is simpler and more efficient but has the drawback of leaking information about ad quality and bid. On the other hand, this information can be determined today by placing ads and monitoring the resulting ranking.

Noting that our auction designs suffer delays causing out-of-date bid information to be used in rankings, we use Bing advertising system auction traces to determine the effect of these delays. We find the effect to be minimal, concluding that our auction designs are viable.

As future work, we plan to implement the auction system for a medium-scale deployment of Privad (several tens of thousands of users). We also plan to design and deploy mechanisms to compute \( U \) and measure their effectiveness. Additionally, we will conduct a measurement study of ads served by Bing to determine the extent to which advertisers can reverse-engineer each other’s bids in today’s systems, quantifying the privacy loss incurred by the Rank-at-Client scheme.

Each of the non-tracking advertising schemes proposed so far assumes a single broker and a single profiler operating at each client. We are interested in exploring what happens if there are multiple brokers with competing profilers in each client. These profilers should be able to dynamically compete for ad boxes in real-time, adding a new element to the auction. Clients may also need to compete with existing tracking advertising systems in real-time auctions run by existing ad exchanges. We plan to design and test mechanisms that allow this.
