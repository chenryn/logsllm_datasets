router is mapped to the ASN assigned to the largest number of its IP addresses
(with an IP apparition order for tie-breaking equality cases). Let Sr be the set of
the occurrence of each IP-to-AS mapping computed on addresses belonging to
the router r. If r is initially mapped to AS n, it means that n appears max(Sr)
times in the IP-to-AS mapping of r. We attribute a conﬁdence level to the ASN
mapped to r in such a way: c(r) = 1 − max(Sr\{max(Sr)})
. Closer to one, higher
the conﬁdence in the mapping. Note that r ∈ SAS if c(r)  lb > N0 > lan > N1 > H0.9 > N2 > H0.8 >
N3 > . . . > N10 > c2p > N11 where Hβ stands for a β-conﬁdent assignment
rule. According to the conﬁdence threshold 0  β (for a given
router r ∈ SAS mapped to the ASN n with the elec rule), Hβ maps deﬁnitively
r to n by attributing to r a conﬁdence level of 1. In order to take advantage
of AS assignments produced by the decreasing level of conﬁdence of our set of
rules, we apply the neighboring rule between each other rules’ application.
Moreover, we use a threshold 0  0.5 (6.4% com-
pared to 5.6% when c ≤ 0.5). However, using our threshold α = 0.5, we only
eﬀectively record the 5.6% of changes that are not strongly inconsistent (c ≤ 0.5)
to stay consistent with the elec rule. We have also noticed that less than 6% of
routers among the SAS set are subject to real inconsistencies (see [7]).
To summarize, we have seen that 90% of the routers are assigned, directly at
the ﬁrst step of the algorithm, to an ASN with the highest level of conﬁdence.
The remaining 10% of routers belongs to SAS and represent thus critical cases.

Our algorithm is able to quickly solve a large subset of those cases. At the end
of the process, only 0.46% of the routers remain unmapped.
A more detailed discussion on the algorithm evaluation as well as on particular
cases may be found in [7]. In particular, we have empirically veriﬁed that the
AS where our probing host is located (AS2259) is correctly and fully discovered
by our algorithm.
3.3 Point to Point Links and Switches
In addition to our router-to-AS algorithm, we also provide a way to distinguish
point-to-point links from switch inter-connections. As previously mentioned (see
Fig. 1), replies collected with mrinfo-rec allow us to easily discover switch
pseudo-nodes and extract them from our raw data.
This point is of the highest importance since it provides accurate information
on the real network connectivity. Using traceroute-like probing, switches are
not easily detectable and this bias leads to produce false interpretations: a set
of nodes may appear to be fully meshed whereas they are actually connected
through a simple switch. Identifying switches in mrinfo output is straightforward
as it is enough to capture outgoing IP addresses appearing several times on the
same router (see interface 1.1.2.1 on router R2 in Fig. 1).
Note that a switch inter-connection discovered with mrinfo-rec can hide a
switch cascade, i.e., several switches might be connected together. It can also
hide some other types of level 2 inter-connections. Moreover, when possible,
we verify that all routers connected through a switch share the same vision
of the inter-connection (e.g., one IP address pointing towards the same set of
addresses).
Fig. 7 provides the distribution of switches and routers over the 56 weeks.
On average, we identify that 11% of inter-connection points discovered in the
networks are switches (or cascade of switches), while the remaining 89% are
actual routers. Note that the same distribution occurs when we distinguish

inter-domain from intra-domain connections. Only 1% of the whole set of discov-
ered nodes are inter-domain switches (Internet exchange points, IXPs) whereas
9% of them are ASBR. Note that we do not apply the neighboring rule N
for IXPs.
4 Related Work
A tool like Rocketfuel [3] has been used to infer ISP topologies. However, inferring
topologies in a non-cooperative and heterogeneous environment has proven to be
extremely diﬃcult, and results obtained have to be carefully evaluated in terms
of validity [12,13]. The recently introduced DisCarte [14] pushes the accuracy of
collected data a few steps further but it requires the “record route” option being
enable and does not entirely sweep out standard traceroute limitations.
Mao et al. provide mechanisms for improving the IP-to-AS mapping [15,16].
Their techniques are based on several information sources: traceroute, BGP up-
date, BGP table dumps, and reverse DNS lookup. In addition, they propose
heuristics for identifying IXPs, sibling ASes as well as ASes sharing address
space. Their work diﬀers from ours as they focus only on IP-to-AS mapping and
not on router-to-AS mapping.
The recent work done by claﬀy et al. is probably the most relevant compared to
this paper [10]. For assigning ASes to routers, claﬀy et al. assume that a provider
always gives IP addresses belonging to its own address space for connections to
their customers [10]. Given that assumption, the router-to-AS mapping becomes
straightforward when focusing on customer-to-provider links (and reciprocally).
Otherwise, the router is assigned to the AS with the smallest outdegree. Note
that no evaluation of this technique has yet been made in [10].
5 Conclusion
We provide a mechanism for extracting intra-domain topologies from raw data col-
lected by mrinfo, a multicast based tool that is able to silently discover all inter-
faces of a router. The main challenge is to mark the boundaries of each AS. The goal
of our algorithm is to assign an AS number to a router, performing the so called
router-to-AS mapping. We demonstrate that our router-to-AS mapping is able to
eﬃciently assign an AS number to a router with a high conﬁdence level. In addi-
tion, our AS extraction mechanism is able to discover connections through layer-
2 switches, providing a more accurate view of the topology than with traceroute
probing. Finally, we provide, in various format, several intra-domain topologies for
Tier-1, Transit, and Stub networks all along the four years of collected data.
We believe the technique described in this paper as well as the whole mrinfo
dataset are valuable for the research community. Indeed, the next steps of this
work would be to deeply study intra-domain topologies and improve mrinfo based
probing using complementary topology discovery methods.
