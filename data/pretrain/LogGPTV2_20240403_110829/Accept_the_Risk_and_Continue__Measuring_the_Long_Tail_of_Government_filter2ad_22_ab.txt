### 4.1 Filtering Hostnames
Switzerland, for example, uses the `.admin` domain. We filter hostnames in our dataset using known expectations and exceptions, along with country code extensions, to ensure high precision, albeit with limited recall. This conservative approach ensures that our list contains only government websites. For instance, `environment.gov.au`, `geoporal.capmas.gov.eg`, `stats.data.gouv.fr`, and `www.pwebapps.ezv.admin.ch` are valid hostnames because they follow the format of a valid government domain name extension followed by a country code, making them valid ccTLDs included in our scan.

### 4.2 Expanding the Dataset
We expanded our initial list through three mechanisms: 
1. Crowdsourcing local hostnames using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).
2. Crawling the hostnames in our list.
3. Hand-curating and whitelisting a set of government hostnames that do not use standard government domain extensions.

#### 4.2.1 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
Seeding with sites from the top millions inherently biases our results towards larger or more connected countries. To mitigate this bias, we used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a popular crowdwork platform, to publish tasks for finding government websites in countries where we had few or no hostnames. Each task asked workers to enter up to six URLs from a specific country, with USD 0.60 paid per task. To encourage site diversity, we asked workers to find different categories of government sites, including:
- National Government (or the Presidency if no national government site was available)
- Public Health (or a government News/Media site if none available)
- Taxes (or Finance Ministry if none available)
- Immigration or Travel
- Any two different departments not covered

Tasks were completely anonymous, with no repeat responses allowed from the same worker. The only demographic information queried was a binary Yes/No indicating if the worker was from the country in the issued task.

We published tasks for countries with fewer than 11 hostnames in the seed list, including Andorra, Chad, Chile, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Iceland, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Tanzania, Thailand, Tonga, Greenland, Western Sahara, Falkland Islands, Puerto Rico, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Northern Cyprus, Somaliland, Kosovo, South Sudan, and Niger. We received 108 responses, of which we accepted 75 after manual inspection. Eleven workers self-reported as being from one of these countries: 4 from Greenland, 2 from the DRC, and 1 each from Andorra, Costa Rica, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, and Kosovo.

From the 108 MTurk tasks, we obtained 199 unique hostnames, with 61 already in the seed list. Adding 138 new hostnames brought the total to 27,794.

#### 4.2.2 Crawling Government Websites
We built a web crawler for the above seed list (inclusive of added MTurk hostnames) that visits every hostname, gathers all links on the page not yet seen by the crawler with a valid country code extension (according to ICANN), and follows the links for seven levels of depth before terminating the crawl for that hostname.

The crawler began with 27,794 hostnames and retrieved 843,561 hostnames in total, resulting in 301,219 unique hostnames after deduplication, of which only 7,723 were repeated from the top million datasets. After strict filtering for government hostnames as described in Section 4.1, 134,812 remained. The crawls were completed from the University of Washington between March 1st and 3rd, 2020.

The rate of hostname discovery steadily declined after the fifth level, leaving us with 134,812 unique government hostnames at the end of the crawl. See Appendix A.3 for more information on the growth of the dataset.

#### 4.2.3 Hostname Search and Whitelisting
Finally, we manually investigated the seed list for each country, adding missing websites to ensure inclusion of improperly filtered hostnames, obvious sites from top search engine results, and long-tail countries still having fewer than 11 total sites after the MTurk tasks. We found these websites via a combination of Google searches, manual crawling of seed list links, and foreign embassy or non-government travel sites, with careful individual scrutiny for signs of legitimacy and impersonation or phishing.

This produced a hand-curated whitelist of 596 government hostnames from 62 countries, which we included with the final list of 134,812 filtered unique hostnames, resulting in a total of 135,408. Even after this process, 15 countries remained with fewer than 11 sites: Chad, Comoros, DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Honduras, Nauru, Niger, North Korea, Palau, São Tomé and Príncipe, South Sudan, Togo, and Tuvalu.

We also manually added hostnames from Germany, Greenland, Gabon, Denmark, and the Netherlands, which do not use any variation of our expected government domain extensions, as well as 14 countries using TLDs such as `.com`, `.org`, and `.net`, to our whitelist. We did not crawl these whitelisted hosts with our automated crawler because we could not programmatically confirm linked sites as government-operated without manually visiting and tagging the crawl results.

Using the final list of hostnames, we performed measurements between April 22nd and April 26th, 2020. For the measurements, we performed full TLS and TCP handshakes with the root page of each website and retrieved the certificate chain along with the peer certificate. In case of failures to connect, we performed three retries for the hostname by adding the request to the queue. If the host did not return a status 200 code after three attempts, either because the domain name could not be resolved or we could not fetch any content over HTTP or HTTPS, we deemed the website "unavailable" and excluded it from further analysis. The results in this paper were obtained from a single snapshot. Future work could monitor sites periodically to identify changes in HTTPS adoption.

| Number of Govt. Websites | Top 1000 (1K) | Top 10000 (10K) | Top 100000 (100K) | Top 1000000 (1M) |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Majestic Million         | 56            | 508              | 2538               | 12445             |
| Cisco Million            | 0             | 14               | 433                | 9296              |
| Tranco Million           | 30            | 373              | 2351               | 12293             |

**Table 1: Overlap of Our Government Website Dataset With Public Top Millions**

#### 4.2.4 Ranking
As our authoritative ranking dataset, we used the Tranco Million, a curated list of top million sites optimized for lower churn and thus more research validity. 12,293 (<10%) of our 135,408 discovered hostnames were present. The small overlap of our generated list and the Tranco million suggests that most of our discovered hostnames likely lie in the long tail of the Internet and outside prior analyses. The overlap with Tranco and other popular top million datasets are presented in Table 1. In Section 5.5, we present comparisons between government and non-government websites in the top million using the Tranco million dataset.

**Note:** We identified some inaccuracies due to timeouts from our scanners while measuring the adoption of HTTPS for New Zealand, Republic of Congo, Togo, and United Arab Emirates. We performed an additional scan on September 9, 2020, and updated our results.

### 4.3 Certificate Validation
We used OpenSSL for validation of certificates and certificate chains downloaded from all hosts. To mark a website as valid in our scans, we validate the entire certificate chain. We chose OpenSSL with the default trust store shipped with the Apple Mac operating system imported into the machine over Mozilla’s NSS or the Chromium trusted certificate store, as it is the most restrictive and does not include certificates that might be available individually in the browsers’ codebases based on their trust with the CA as described in section 3.2. As a result, our scan shows a small number of certificates as invalid, which are valid when using a specific browser or operating system, due to our conservative trust store. Based on our disclosure reports and the responses obtained as described in section 7.2.1, we identified 8 hostnames that were invalid in our scans but are valid on some known web browsers and operating systems.

### 4.4 Ethical Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and exempted under ID STUDY00009482 by the University of Washington Human Subjects Division. The authors involved in the study did not tamper with any vulnerable government website and executed a full responsible disclosure process by informing the respective country’s government authorities and the corresponding technology or administrative contact listed on the WHOIS services of the host. The authors only used port 80 and 443 to access the websites and did not perform any port scanning actions that might result in abuse of the hosts in the target.

### 5. Results
We provide several measurements of HTTPS adoption among our curated list of government websites. We first present our overall measurements on worldwide adoption of HTTPS (Section 5.1), identify the most popular certificate issuers for government sites (Section 5.2), and provide a breakdown of reasons for certificate invalidity among affected hosts (Section 5.3). We then identify the effects of hosting type and hosting providers on certificate validity (Section 5.4), compare our government websites to non-government websites within the top million (Section 5.5), and conclude that government websites have overall poorer valid HTTPS adoption. To offset data collection biases, we perform detailed case studies with two countries' official authoritative datasets (Section 6) and find certificate invalidity results worldwide.

#### 5.1 HTTPS Adoption, Use, and Issues
Of the 135,408 worldwide government hostnames analyzed, 82,152 (60.67%) only support HTTP, while 53,256 (39.33%) serve their content with HTTPS. Only 38,033 (28.08%) use HTTPS correctly, even when optimistically including the 4,126 sites that load content on both HTTP and HTTPS.

We show overall results by country as a chloropleth map in Figure 1. Within the United States, while a majority of the websites do support HTTPS, there are still 1,841 sites (18.45%) that have no HTTPS and 1,147 sites (11.49%) serving both HTTP and HTTPS traffic; we examine the USA further as a detailed case study in Section 6.1.

**Figure 1: Worldwide view of Government Websites**
- **Top:** The percentage of government websites from our total list that are available, where the host returns a 200 status code.
- **Middle:** The percentage of available sites that support HTTPS.
- **Bottom:** The percentage of sites that support HTTPS and have valid certificates.

#### 5.2 Certificate Authorities
Most (20.03%) of HTTPS-enabled government websites worldwide use certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt, with approximately 80% of them being valid. Approximately 20% invalidity is due to expiry, misconfiguration leading to incorrect certificate usage by the host, or self-signing of certificates. The top 15 CAs used by governments, including Let’s Encrypt, do not provide EV certificates. The first major EV certificate issuer, DigiCert, has approximately 20% invalid certificates for government hostnames, similar to Let’s Encrypt. This suggests that EV certificates obtained for a fee may be equally likely to be invalid as free CAs. We show a breakdown of the certificate issuers and their number of invalid certificates worldwide in Figure 2.

The top CAs issuing certificates for government hostnames differ by country. For example, the leading certificate issuer in Switzerland is QuoVadis Global SSL ICA G3, while in China it is Encryption Everywhere DV TLS CA-G1. From a global perspective, Let’s Encrypt continues to be the leading CA authority issuing certificates. We expect this is due to the low cost (free) of certificate issuance and ease of installation with tools like Certbot by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF).

#### 5.3 Common Certificate Errors
Combining valid and invalid certificates, 53,256 websites in our list attempt to serve HTTPS web content. Filtering out 2,721 hostnames with exceptions and other errors, and 92 hostnames without availability, we analyze the remaining hostnames for common certificate errors.

**Table 2: Worldwide Government Sites by HTTPS Validity and Error**

| Total websites considered | 135,408 |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Content served on HTTP only | 82,152 (60.67%) |
| Content served on HTTPS    | 53,256 (39.33%) |
| Valid HTTPS Certificates   | 38,033 (71.41%) |
| Invalid HTTPS Certificates | 15,223 (28.58%) |
| Hostname Mismatch          | 5,571 (36.59%)  |
| Unable to get local issuer cert | 3,732 (24.51%) |
| Exceptions                 | 2,619 (17.20%)  |
| Unsupported SSL Protocol   | 1,929 (73.65%)  |
| Timed out                  | 378 (14.43%)    |
| Connection refused         | 135 (5.15%)     |
| Connection Reset by peer   | 141 (5.38%)     |
| Wrong SSL Version Number   | 11 (0.42%)      |
| TLSv1 Alert Internal Error | 9 (0.34%)       |
| SSLv3 Alert Handshake Failure | 7 (0.26%) |
| TLSv1 Alert Internal Proto. V. | 8 (0.30%)  |
| Self-signed certificate    | 2,014 (13.22%)  |
| Certificate Expired        | 550 (5.50%)     |
| Self-signed certificate in chain | 347 (2.27%) |
| Others                     | 102 (0.67%)     |

All percentages are computed out of the category level directly above it (for example, Unsupported SSL Protocol accounts for 73.65% of Exceptions.)

32% of these had a total validity of less than 2 years. 1,746 (14%) were issued for greater than 3 years. 40 certificates had an expiry date 100 years from the year of issue. 617 websites had invalid certificates issued for 10 years, 155 for 20 years, 36 for 30 years, and 1 for 50 years. One certificate had an issue date in 1970 (Unix epoch time) expiring in 70 years, likely indicating misconfiguration. 5,372 (43.24%) were issued for a duration in multiples of 365.

#### 5.3.2 Cryptographic Key Usage & Signing Algorithms
We find several patterns relating certificate validity, host public key size, and CA signing algorithm. Figure 4 (first panel) shows that one-fourth of hosts using RSA with 2048- and 4096-bit public keys have invalid certificates. 520 government hostnames use cryptographically insecure 1024-bit RSA. In the USA, NIST issued a special public document recommending key lengths larger than 1024, with popular tools like OpenSSL being compliant. We also find that RSA key sizes of 3248 bits are generally misconfigured due to incorrect usage, and 8192 bits due to lack of support in browsers for validating key sizes greater than 4096 bits. We see an increasing use of elliptic curve (EC) cryptography, dominated by 256-bit keys.

Figure 4 (second panel) shows certificate validity by signing algorithm used by the CA issuer. 920 government websites still use certificates signed using MD5 or SHA1 hash with RSA Encryption. A sizeable number of certificates are issued with elliptic curve (ECDSA) signatures, correlated with a higher number of valid certificates.
