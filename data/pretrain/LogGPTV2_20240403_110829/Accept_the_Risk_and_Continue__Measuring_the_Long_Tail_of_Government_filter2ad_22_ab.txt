Switzerland uses .admin. We filter hostnames in the dataset using
these known expectations and exceptions, along with country code
extensions, as a conservative filter with high precision but limited
recall. This was decided to ensure that our list was comprised of
only government websites. For example, environment.gov.au, geopor-
tal.capmas.gov.eg, stats.data.gouv.fr & www.pwebapps.ezv.admin.ch
are valid hostnames because they follow the format of a valid gov-
ernment domain name extension followed by a country code, mak-
ing them valid ccTLDs included in our scan.
4.2 Expanding the Dataset
We expanded this initial list through three separate mechanisms: 1)
crowdsourcing local hostnames using Amazon Mechanical Turk,
2) crawling the hostnames in our list, and 3) hand-curating and
whitelisting a set of government hostnames which do not use stan-
dard government domain extensions.

4.2.1 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Seeding with sites from
the top millions inherently biases our results towards larger or more
connected countries. To combat (but not entirely remove) this bias,
we used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a popular crowdwork
platform [44], to publish tasks for finding government websites for
countries where we had only a few or no hostnames. Each task
asked a worker to enter up to six URLs from a specific country, with
USD 0.60 paid per task. To encourage site diversity, we asked work-
ers to find different categories of government sites. The categories
were: the National Government (or the Presidency if no national
government site was available), Public Health (or a government
News/Media site if none available), Taxes (or Finance Ministry if
none available), Immigration or Travel, and any 2 different depart-
ments not covered. The tasks were completely anonymous with no
repeat responses allowed from the same worker. The only demo-
graphic information queried was a binary Yes/No indicating if the
worker was from the country in the issued task.
We published tasks for countries with less than 11 hostnames
in the seed list (from section 4.1), including Andorra, Chad, Chile,
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Iceland, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Tanzania,
Thailand, Tonga, Greenland, Western Sahara, Falkland Islands,
Puerto Rico, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Northern Cyprus,
Somaliland, Kosovo, South Sudan, and Niger. We received 108 re-
sponses, of which we accepted 75 after manual inspection. 11 work-
ers self-reported as being from one of these countries. They were:
4 from Greenland, 2 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), and 1 each from Andorra, Costa Rica, New Zealand, New
Caledonia, Solomon Islands and Kosovo.
We obtained a total of 199 unique hostnames from the 108 MTurk
tasks we issued, with 61 already in the seed list. 138 new hostnames
were added to our seed list, bringing the size to 27,794.
4.2.2 Crawling Government Websites. We built a web crawler for
the above seed list (inclusive of added MTurk hostnames) that
visits every hostname, gathers all links on the page not yet seen
by the crawler with a valid country code extension (according to
ICANN [40]) and follows the links for 7 levels of depth before
terminating the crawl for that hostname.
The crawler began with 27,794 hostnames and retrieved 843,561
hostnames in total, resulting in 301,219 unique hostnames after de-
duplication, of which only 7,723 were repeated from the top million
datasets. 134,812 remained after strict filtering for government
hostnames as described in Section 4.1.1. The crawls were completed
from the University of Washington between 1st-3rd March 2020.
We measured the rate at which the dataset grew from our initial
seed list as a result of the crawler. The rate of hostname discovery
steadily declines for each level after the 5th, leaving us with 134,812
unique government hostnames at the end of the crawl. See the
appendix A.3 for more information on the growth of the dataset.
4.2.3 Hostname Search and Whitelisting. Finally, we manually in-
vestigated the seed list for each and every country, adding missing
websites to ensure inclusion of improperly filtered hostnames, obvi-
ous sites from top search engine results, and long-tail countries still
having less than 11 total sites after the MTurk tasks. We found these
websites via a combination of Google search, manual crawling of
seed list links and foreign embassy or non-government travel sites,
and careful individual scrutiny for signs of legitimacy as well as
impersonation or phishing (to the best of the authors’ ability and ex-
pertise). This produced a hand-curated whitelist of 596 government
hostnames from 62 countries, which we included with the final list
of 134,812 filtered unique hostnames, resulting in a total of 135,408.
Even after this process, 15 countries remained with less than 11
sites: Chad, Comoros, DRC, Equitorial Guinea, Eritrea, Honduras,
Nauru, Niger, North Korea, Palau, Sao Tome and Principe, South
Sudan, Togo, and Tuvalu.
We also manually added hostnames from Germany, Greenland,
Gabon, Denmark, and the Netherlands, which do not use any vari-
ation of our expected government domain extensions, as well 14
countries using TLDs such as .com, .org, and .net, to our whitelist.
We did not crawl these whitelisted hosts with our automated crawler
because we could not programmatically confirm linked sites as
government-operated without manually visiting and tagging the
crawl results.
Using the final list of hostnames, we performed measurements
between April 22nd and April 26th, 2020. For the measurements,
we performed full TLS and TCP handshakes with the root page of
each website and retrieved the certificate chain along with the peer
certificate. In case of failures to connect, we performed 3 retries for
the hostname by adding the request to the queue. If the host did
not return a status 200 code after three attempts, either because
the domain name could not be resolved or we could not fetch any
content over http or https, we deemed the website “unavailable”
and excluded it from further analysis. The results in this paper were
obtained from a single snapshot. Future work could monitor sites
periodically to identify changes in https adoption. 1

4.2.4 Ranking. As our authoritative ranking dataset we used the
Tranco Million [49], a curated list of top million sites optimized for
lower churn and thus more research validity. 12,293 (<10%) of our
135,408 discovered hostnames were present. The small overlap of
our generated list and the Tranco million suggest that most of our
discovered hostnames likely lie in the long tail of the Internet and
outside prior analyses. The overlap with Tranco and other popular
top million datasets are presented in Table 1. In Section 5.5 we
present comparisons between government and non-government
websites in the top million using the Tranco million dataset.
1We identified some inaccuracies due to timeouts from our scanners while measuring
the adoption of https for New Zealand, Republic of Congo, Togo, and United Arab
Emirates. We performed an additional scan on 9/9/2020 and updated our results.

4.3 Certificate Validation
We used OpenSSL for validation of certificates and certificate chains
downloaded from all of the hosts [62]. To mark a website as valid
in our scans, we validate the entire certificate chain. We chose
OpenSSL with the default trust store shipped with the Apple Mac
operating system [9] imported into the machine over Mozilla’s
NSS or the Chromium trusted certificate store, since it is the most
restrictive and does not include certificates that might be available
individually in the browsers’ codebases based on their trust with
the CA as described in section 3.2. As a result, our scan shows a
small number of certificates as invalid which are valid when using a
specific browser or operating system, due to our conservative trust
store. Based on our disclosure reports and the responses obtained
as described in section 7.2.1, we identified 8 hostnames that were
invalid in our scans but are valid on some known web browsers
and operating systems.
4.4 Ethical Statement
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)
and exempted under ID STUDY00009482 by the University of Wash-
ington Human Subjects Division. The authors involved in the study
did not tamper with any vulnerable government website and ex-
ecuted a full responsible disclosure process by informing the re-
spective country’s government authorities and the corresponding
technology or administrative contact listed on the whois services
of the host. The authors only used port 80 and 443 to access the
websites and did not perform any port scanning actions that might
result in abuse of the hosts in the target.
5 RESULTS
We provide a number of measurements of https adoption among
our curated list of government websites. We first present our over-
all measurements on worldwide adoption of https (section 5.1),
identify the most popular certificate issuers for government sites
(section 5.2), and provide a breakdown of reasons for certificate
invalidity among affected hosts (section 5.3). We then identify the
effects of hosting type and hosting providers on certificate validity
(section 5.4), compare our government websites to non-government
websites within the top million (section 5.5), and conclude that gov-
ernment websites have overall poorer valid https adoption. To
offset data collection biases, we perform detailed case studies with
two countries’ with official authoritative datasets (section 6) and
find certificate invalidity results worldwide.
5.1 https Adoption, Use, and Issues
Of 135,408 worldwide government hostnames analyzed, 82,152
(60.67%) only support http, while 53,256 (39.33%) serve their con-
tent with https. Only 38,033 (28.08%) use https correctly, even
when optimistically including the 4,126 sites that load content on
both http and https.
We show overall results by country as a chloropleth map in
Figure 1. Within the United States, while a majority of the websites
do support https, there are still 1,841 sites (18.45%) that have no
https and 1,147 sites (11.49%) serving both http and https traffic;
we examine the USA further as a detailed case study in section 6.1.
Figure 1: Worldwide view of Government Websites
Top: the percentage of government websites from our total list that are
available, where the host returns a 200 status code. Middle: the percentage
of available sites which support https. Bottom: the percentage of sites that
support https which have valid certificates.
5.2 Certificate Authorities
Most (20.03%) of https enabled government websites worldwide
use certificates issued by Let’s Encrypt with ≈80% of them being
valid. ≈20% invalidity is due to expiry, misconfiguration leading to
incorrect certificate usage by the host, or self-signing of certificates.
The top 15 CAs used by governments, including Let’s Encrypt,
do not provide EV certificates. The first major EV certificate issuer,
DigiCert, has ∼20% invalid certificates for government hostnames,
similar to Let’s Encrypt. This case suggests EV certificates obtained
for a fee may be equally likely to be invalid as free CAs. We show
a breakdown of the certificate issuers and their number of invalid
certificates worldwide in Figure 2.
The top CAs issuing certificates for government hostnames differ
by country. For example, the leading certificate issuer in Switzerland
is QuoVadis Global SSL ICA G3, while in China it is Encryption Ev-
erywhere DV TLS CA-G1. From a global perspective, Let’s Encrypt
continues to be the leading CA authority issuing certificates. We
expect that this is due to the low cost (free) of certificate issuance
and ease of installation with tools like certbot by the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) [27].
5.3 Common Certificate Errors

Table 2: Worldwide govt. sites by https validity and error
All percentages are computed out of the category level directly above it (for
example, Unsupported SSL Protocol accounts for 73.65% of Exceptions.)
32% of these had a total validity of less than 2 years. 1,746 (14%)
were issued for greater than 3 years. 40 certificates had an expiry
date 100 years from the year of issue. 617 websites had invalid
certificates issued for 10 years, 155 for 20 years, 36 for 30 years, and
1 for 50 years. 1 certificate had an issue date in 1970 (Unix epoch
time) expiring in 70 years, likely indicating misconfiguration. 5,372
(43.24%) were issued for a duration in multiples of 365.
5.3.2 Cryptographic Key Usage & Signing Algorithms. We find a
number of patterns relating certificate validity, host public key size,
and CA signing algorithm. Figure 4 (first panel) shows that one-
fourth of hosts using RSA with 2048- and 4096-bit public keys have
invalid certificates. 520 government hostnames use cryptograph-
ically insecure 1024-bit RSA. In the USA, NIST issued a special
public document recommending key lengths larger than 1024 with
popular tools like OpenSSL being compliant [12]. We also find that
RSA key sizes of 3248 bits are generally misconfigured because of
incorrect usage and or 8192 bits due to lack of support in browsers
for validating key sizes greater than 4096 bits. We see an increasing
use of elliptic curve (EC) cryptography, dominated by 256-bit keys.
Figure 4 (second panel) shows certificate validity by signing
algorithm used by the CA issuer. 920 government websites still
use certificates signed using MD5 or SHA1 hash with RSA Encryp-
tion. A sizeable number of certificates are issued with elliptic curve
(ECDSA) signatures, correlated with a higher number of valid cer-
