While running `Pkg.update()` on the current master branch (version 0.4.0-dev+6723), I encountered the following error:

```
INFO: Computing changes...
ERROR: TypeError: map_to!: in typeassert, expected Array{VersionNumber,1}, got Array{VersionNumber,1}
  in map_to! at abstractarray.jl:1307
  in map at ./abstractarray.jl:1326
  in prune_versions at ./pkg/query.jl:232
  in prune_dependencies at ./pkg/query.jl:387

  in anonymous at pkg/dir.jl:31
  in cd at ./file.jl:22
  in cd at pkg/dir.jl:31
  in update at ./pkg.jl:45
```

It appears that the error is due to a `TypeError` where the function `map_to!` is expecting an `Array{VersionNumber,1}` and also receiving an `Array{VersionNumber,1}`. This seems contradictory, as the 'expected' and 'got' types are identical.

Could someone please help me understand if I am missing something here, or if this is indeed a bug?
