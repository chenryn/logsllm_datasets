User: We need to build a GitLab server within the company and provide a comprehensive building solution.
Assistant: The following steps are required to build a GitLab server: 1. Select the operating system GitLab server supports multiple operating systems, including Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, and OpenSUSE. In order to facilitate management and deployment, it is recommended to choose Ubuntu or CentOS. 2. Install dependent software Before installing GitLab, you need to install some prerequisite software, including curl, openssh-server, postfix, gawk, and vim. In the Ubuntu system, it can be installed by the following command: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install curl openssh-server ca-certificates postfix In the CentOS system, it can be installed by the following command: sudo yum install curl openssh-server postfix 3. Installing GitLab The easiest way to install GitLab is to install it through the official script provided by GitLab. You only need to execute the following two commands: curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script .deb.sh | sudo bash sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce or curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ce/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash sudo yum install gitlab- ce 4. Configure GitLab After the installation is complete, the basic configuration of GitLab is required. First, you need to modify the configuration file /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb, and perform some necessary configurations, including SMTP mailbox configuration, Web access address, Git access address, backup directory, time, etc. Then, you need to execute the following command to make the configuration file take effect: sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure 5. Log in to GitLab Enter the GitLab access address in the browser, and enter the account name and password to log in to GitLab according to the prompts. The default account name is root, and the password is the root password of the system. You can also change the password through the web interface. 6. Create a project After logging in successfully, you can create a project. Select "Projects" in the left navigation bar, then select the "New Project" button, fill in the project name, description, visibility and other information, and click the "Create Project" button to create it successfully. The above are the basic steps to build a GitLab server. If you need more detailed operation manuals, please refer to the official GitLab documentation.
