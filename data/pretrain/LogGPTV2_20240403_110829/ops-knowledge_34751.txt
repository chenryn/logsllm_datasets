User: I'm developing an app (with Python and Google App Engine) that requires to load some content (basically text) stored in a bucket inside the Google Cloud Storage. Everything works as expected but I'm trying to optimize the application performance. I have two different options: I can parse the content via the urllib library (the content is public) and read it or I can load the content using the cloudstorage library provided by Google. My question is: in terms of performance, which method is better?
Thank you all.
Assistant: They will likely be very close. the AppEngine cloud storage library uses the URL fetch service, just like urllib.
Nonetheless, like any performance tuning, I'd suggest measuring on your own.
