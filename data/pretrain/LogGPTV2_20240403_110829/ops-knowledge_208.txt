User: Please explain what is DNS resolution? What are the possible problems in the DNS resolution process?
Assistant: DNS (Domain Name System, Domain Name System) resolution is the process of converting a website domain name into an IP address. When the user enters the domain name of the website in the browser, the browser will send a query request to the local DNS server, and the local DNS server will forward the request to the root DNS server, top-level DNS server and authoritative DNS server until the IP address corresponding to the website domain name is found. The IP address is then returned to the browser. DNS resolution may have the following problems: 1. DNS server failure: If the local DNS server, root DNS server, top-level DNS server or authoritative DNS server fails, the website cannot be resolved. 2. DNS cache problem: If expired or wrong DNS records are stored in the cache of the local DNS server, the website cannot be resolved. 3. DNS pollution problem: Attackers implement DNS spoofing attacks by tampering with DNS responses or inserting false records in DNS, so that the websites visited by users are redirected to malicious websites. 4. DNS attack problem: Attackers attack the DNS server or DNS query process through DNS hijacking, DNS poisoning, etc., resulting in the failure of the website to be parsed. 5. Network connection problems: If there is a problem with the user's network connection, DNS resolution may fail.
