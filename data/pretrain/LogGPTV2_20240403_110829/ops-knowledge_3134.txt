User: Eclipse can run a python project rather than just one .py file. Is it possible to run an entire project from Python 3.x shell. I looked into it a little, but I didn't really find a way. I tried just running the .py file with the main using exec(open('bla/blah/projMain.py')) like you would any python file. All of my modules (including the main) is in one package, but when I ran the main I got a no module named 'blah' (the package it is in). Also, as a side note there is in fact aninit.pyand even apycache' directory.
Maybe I didn't structure it correctly with Eclipse (or rather maybe Eclipse didn't structure it properly), but Eclipse can run it, so how can I with a Python 3.4.1 shell? Do I have to put something in __init__.py, perhaps, and then run that file?
Assistant: Based on current information, I would suggest you to run it this way in OSX
1) Bring up the Terminal app
2) cd to the location where bla lives
3) run python bla/blah/projMain.py
