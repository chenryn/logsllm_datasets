User: is there a way to find out from within a python program if it was started in a terminal or e.g. in a batch engine like sun grid engine?
the idea is to decide on printing some progress bars and other ascii-interactive stuff, or not.
thanks!

Assistant: You can use os.getppid() to find out the process id for the parent-process of this one, and then use that process id to determine which program that process is running. More usefully, you could use sys.stdout.isatty() -- that doesn't answer your title question but appears to better solve the actual problem you explain (if you're running under a shell but your output is piped to some other process or redirected to a file you probably don't want to emit "interactive stuff" on it either).
