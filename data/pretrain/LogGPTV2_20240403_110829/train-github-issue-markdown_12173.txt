three.js's documentation contains a bunch of fake hyperlinks; anchor tags
which do not have an `href` attribute but instead rely on JavaScript `onclick`
events to navigate.
These links can't be opened in new tabs by middle-clicking or by right-
clicking. The links also don't show a URL preview in the status bar when the
user hovers over them.
This is terrible for usability and should be universally discouraged across
the web.
Example:
  1. Open https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/animation/AnimationAction
  2. Try to middle-click the blue _AnimationClips_ text which appears to be a hyperlink.
  3. Try to right-click the same text and open the link in a new tab or new window.
  4. You can't.
The links should have a proper `href` attribute added to them.
