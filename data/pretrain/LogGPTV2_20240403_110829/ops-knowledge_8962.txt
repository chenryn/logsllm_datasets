Question: A web application uses GET requests with query parameters to perform actions that change the server's state, such as updating user preferences. What could be the security implications of this approach?
"A": "Sensitive data such as preferences may get exposed in server logs.",
"B": "GET requests can't have a body, which reduces the amount of data that can be sent.",
"C": "GET requests to update preferences might be less efficient than using POST requests.",
"D": "The approach violates the principle that GET requests should not change server state and may lead to unintended side effects."
