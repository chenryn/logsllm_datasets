User: How to get the number of user registrations in a specified time period through SQL query?
Assistant: The number of user registrations within a specified time period can be obtained through the following SQL query: ``` SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM users WHERE created_time >= '2021-01-01 00:00:00' AND created_time <= '2021- 12-31 23:59:59'; ``` This query assumes that the registered user information is stored in the data table named "users", which includes the "created_time" field of each user's registration time. To get the number of registered users in the specified time period, you need to replace the correct start time and end time with "2021-01-01 00:00:00" and "2021-12-31 23:59: Between 59" will do.
