Hello, I am using OS X EL Capitan(10.11.3) and vscode : Version 0.10.8
(0.10.8).  
Following steps gives me invalid result and code loss:
  1. write few lines of code
  2. select those lines (Shift+arrow key)  
3.press tab, and you will indent the code.  
4.But if you press cmd+s (for saving file) and again pressed a tab
button(while the code is selected already), the code vanishes leaving behind
3-4 last characters of those lines.
My concern is before indenting the selected code with tab button if you
pressed cmd+s :+1 it should not affect the indentation or replace it with
unwanted code.
Hope you are able to replicate it :)  
Thanks in advance..
