• 
$1.5 M in FY 2004 HSGP funds are being used to establish the Global 
Security System (GSS Net) First Alert System.  The contract was 
awarded to the Mississippi-based company, Global Security Systems 
Network, to create the alert system that broadcasts a digital text message 
through FM frequencies to emergency responders during times of crisis.  
The project is managed by the University of Mississippi, and the MS 
Public Broadcasting agreed to partner on this initiative by providing the 
use of their tower network as the backbone for the State-wide alert system.   
• 
Also, the MS Office of Homeland Security intends to allocate HSGP funds to the 
following project, although the funding amount has not yet been determined.  The intent 
is to partner with the MS Automated System Project to make significant upgrades to 
public safety information and communication infrastructure.  This will enhance the 
ability of the first responder community in accessing much needed applications such as 
Jail Management, Records Management or Computer Aided Dispatch.  Through these 
tools, first responders 
will have instant access 
to information such as 
arrest warrants, mug 
shots, criminal data, 
HAZMAT data and 
medical emergency 
protocols.  It will help 
facilitate regional 
information while at the 
same time enabling data 
ownership and control 
by each agency.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
 Enhancement of the state interoperable communication capabilities continues to be a 
state priority. A statewide interoperable communications plan is being developed by 
the Missouri State Highway Patrol (MSHP) under the direction of the Homeland 
Security Advisory Council (HSAC) and the State Interoperable Executive Committee 
(SIEC). This baseline plan will be used as a baseline for the development of 
Interoperable Communications Plans in the nine Missouri Homeland Security 
Regions. It is anticipated that this planning effort will be completed by the end of 
FY2006.  Over the past two years over $13.7 million was competitively awarded to local jurisdictions in 
Missouri for the improvement and enhancements of their interoperable communications efforts under 
direction of the HSAC and SEIC.  The award process involving a peer review committee (including 
members of the SIEC and other communication experts) resulted in awarding funds to 347 jurisdictions 
across the State. Additionally grants were awarded to Independence, Missouri and the City of St. Louis 
for the installation of interoperable communication switches.  
The St. Louis Urban Area has implemented a Swap (Cache) Radios system.  “Swapping radios” refers to 
maintaining a cache of standby radios that can be deployed to support regional incidents.  These radios 
may be from a regional cache, or 
from a participating agency.  This 
allows all responders to use a 
common, compatible set of radios 
during an incident.  Additionally 
they have Shared Channels, 
“Shared channels” refer to 
common channels that have been 
established within the region, 
within each respective state, or by 
local agreement.  Such channels 
are programmed into radios to 
provide interoperable 
communications among agencies.

St. Louis has also instituted a system of “Gateway,” or matrix systems interconnect channels of different 
systems (whether on different bands, modes or proprietary platforms), allowing first responders to use 
their existing radios and channels to be interconnected with the channels of other users outside of their 
agency 
Kansas City Urban Area:  The Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) Regional Interoperability 
Committee oversaw the preparation of an assessment and interoperable communications plan for the 
Kansas City metro area in 2004. Law enforcement, fire, emergency medical service, state and federal 
agencies are working together to enhance interoperable public safety communications through 
implementation of the multi-phase Regional Interoperability Plan.  The Regional Interoperability Plan 
guides homeland security investments to expand and enhance inter-agency coordination and 
communications.  The objective of the plan is to outline resources and process for our region to achieve 
the optimum levels of interoperability as defined in the SAFECOM Interoperability Continuum. The 
FY06 UASI funding request includes support for design of a regional mobile data sharing system.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
• 
The Montana All Threats Intelligence Center (MATIC) and JTTF were 
established last year providing real-time informatics within the state and 
throughout the region. 
• 
Montana State-wide Interoperability Communication Projects has been 
underway for just over one year. This project will provide an effective, 
reliable interoperable communications through three key elements: 1) 
trunked/conventional VHF radio system connecting local, state, tribal and federal response 
agencies across Montana; 2) An integrated mobile data system supports field transmission of data 
to responders; 3) Statewide enhanced 9-1-1 providing wire line and wireless connection from the 
public to the response community.  
• 
The current systems are being designed and coordinated through local stakeholder leadership 
across the state.  The system designs are consistent with the state with in the region as in South 
Dakota and Wyoming, providing wide regional interoperability opportunities across state 
boundaries.   
• 
The Digital Trunked Voice Radio System “backbone” and system is one of the highest priorities 
for the State of Montana 
with regards to homeland 
security initiatives, 
meeting National and 
Target Capabilities. 
• 
Montana has dedicated 90-
100% of its IC funding to 
the expansion, 
enhancement, 
maintenance, training and 
exercising the State-wide 
system.

• NE is achieving communication interoperability by first 
establishing regional communication systems and then by 
integrating those systems to provide statewide interoperability. 
All 93 Nebraska counties are organized into regional areas, which 
has allowed the state to set communication benchmarks.  
Nebraska has allocated $42 million in grant funds from FY99-FY05 towards 
interoperable communications.  This amount equals 66.82% of Nebraska’s overall 
funding, with 83% of FY04 funds and 85% of FY05 funds dedicated to interoperable 
communications.  Projects include the replacement and updating of aging 
communications equipment, communication tower assessments, and a frequency study. 
• The South Sioux City Information Sharing Project utilized $457,226.00 towards an 
Internet and broadband, Non-Line-of-Sight wireless network that covers the entire 
geographic area of South 
Sioux City, NE.  The 
project also provides 
coverage into neighboring 
Nebraska, South Dakota 
and Iowa communities. 
This is the first time that a 
Nebraska community will 
have a wireless 
communications network 
for all possible mobile 
data communication 
needs. The wireless 
network was constructed

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
Interoperable communications equipment expenditures were the top priorities for 
Clark County (and the included southern Nevada cities) for the 04 grant program. 
Approximately $4.5M (SHSP) was allocated to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police 
Department (Metro) to migrate some 5,000 public safety users from a conventional 
VHF system to a 700MHz trunking system. The result will enable Metro to be 
interoperable with Las Vegas and Clark County fire departments, North Las Vegas, Henderson, 
and University Police Departments and state agencies like the Highway Patrol, Department of 
Transportation as well as agencies located in the north part of the state. 
Additionally, some $1.1M (SHSP) was prioritized to allow dispatch centers to be connected 
together to enhance the region’s ability for back-up communication should a dispatch center 
become inoperable for any reason. 
$1.3M (SHSP) was allocated for 
the City of North Las Vegas for 
their communications upgrades 
to ensure compatibility with the 
surrounding public safety 
agencies. 
And, $2.3M (SHSP) was also 
allocated for microwave 
communications system 
expansion efforts to ensure 
effective communications 
throughout the region.
