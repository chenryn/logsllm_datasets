With the proposal for #22858, I've been thinking it could be useful to have a
type which commonly represents "AllIndices". So `A[AllIndices()]` would return
`A`, making it the identity indexing element in some sense.
The reason is so that this could handle non-standard indexing. In some
algorithms you might want the user to specify some indices that they "want to
save", and you can default to `AllIndices`. In many of these cases, you
haven't built the array yet and may be getting a non-standard type from the
user, so defaulting to `eachindex` or something like that isn't possible.
Currently a way to handle this is to default the chosen indices to `nothing`,
and if you see `nothing` you treat it as `AllIndices` applied to the type by
iterating `eachindex` after the array is built.
The name could change of course.
