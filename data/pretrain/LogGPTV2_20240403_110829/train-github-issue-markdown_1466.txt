**Current Behavior:**
When the `body` is `null`, accessing `body.text` results in an error. This issue can be traced back to the following line of code:
- Source: [body.ts#L43](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/http/src/body.ts#L43)

**Expected/Desired Behavior:**
A method or condition should be added to handle cases where the `body` is `null` to prevent errors.

**Angular Version:**
- 2.0.0-rc.5
