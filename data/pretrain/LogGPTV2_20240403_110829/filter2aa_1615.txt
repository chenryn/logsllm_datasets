t’s true, the breaking waves of the future – as we construct it
inside our societal mind, inside our cultural frames - inundate the
past and the future often happens now before the past, some of
the eddies of the future, some of the backwaters of the past. But it
helps to remember that nobody can surf all the waves, that eddies
and backwaters, dragging us into the tide or sucking us back into the
water like waves on a beach, hold all of us back or down in most
domains while we see clearly only in a few selected others.
That’s why the Masters can do what they do, breaking memory
into bits.
We call geniuses those who surf two or three waves at a time and
integrate their experiences in a true-life tale of a surf bum’s life.
That’s not me. All I can do is document the end of time as it had been
constructed in this little blip of historical fiction. If history is our
myth, maybe this is a time of demythologizing. Maybe fiction is our
myth, now, not history. And of course by “time” I don’t mean time,
whatever that might be. If exploring UFO phenomena for more than
thirty years has taught me anything, it’s that our lack of comprehen-
sion of what is happening is not about space. It’s about time.
Yes. It’s about time.
Isn’t it?

The Last Science Fiction Story
 Science fiction is how a left-brain society once dreamed of the
future.
The dreams became real over long periods of time. Leonardo
daVinci dreamed of submersibles, flying machines, all kinds of crazy
contraptions. One would guess that many of his contemporaries
thought he was crazy. Think of a Neolithic genius trying to describe
an automobile. The feedback loop from crazy to sane took a long
time.
 Humans are social animals. So civilization is a feedback machine.
We build reality in the image of our dreams. As the project of civiliza-
tion became distributed and more flattened, quicker feedback meant
implementing more dreams in less time.
 Several hundred years after daVinci we fly and dive.
 Going to the moon was quicker.
From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne. A pretty good book,
dreamed up in the eighteen sixties. A hundred years later Neil
Armstrong was dancing in moon dust, delivering sound bites.
 Aldous Huxley dreamed of genetic engineering and social condi-
tioning in Brave New World in 1932. Sixty years later we were hard at
it. Call it propaganda, call it spin, call it perception management.
Today people are trained to live inside belief collectives and we are
learning to engineer and modify genetic traits, those that exist and
those we invent. Breeding for success by going to expensive schools

looks sloppy and haphazard compared to the precision of genetic
engineering.
 It took a hundred years to get to the moon. Sixty to create a brave
new world.
  Faster and faster the whirligig of time returns returns to dream-
ers who dream.
 In the nineteen eighties, William Gibson defined cyberspace.
Less than a decade later, we lived in it. Now we don’t even notice,
any more than we notice flying and diving and going to the moon
and glowing fish and tomatoes that don’t freeze.
 First, the dream. Then, in shorter and shorter leaps or loops,
came the reality.
 Science fiction is how a left-brain society dreamed of the future.
 Now that’s done.
 Dreams aren’t over. The future is.
 The future is past.
 This is the last science fiction story ever.
 The future went non-linear in 1973.
 That was the year of the OPEC oil thing. Big companies like Shell
were taken by surprise. They never saw it coming. They had to ask,
why?
 They had been thinking in straight lines. The present led to the
future by one dotted line like a path through a courtyard. The task
was to get there somehow from here. They called it management by
objective and it seemed simple.
 It was simple. Because there was only one future, the one we
could extrapolate from what we knew was true.
 Then we realized (a) we didn’t know what was true and (b) we
could not extrapolate bull-dippy.
 So we invented scenario planning. Actually we borrowed it. It

was used in military circles for a long time. It was a methodology the
time of which had come.
 It works like this: we may not know where we are, but we know
we’re here. What are the likely theres out there? We fanned hands of
possible futures like playing cards. Three or four hands were plenty.
Pick one, any one.
 We asked ourselves, what has to happen for this or that to
happen?
 As futures emerged faster and faster from rapidly receding
presents, we had to ask that question again and again, faster and
faster.
 Yep, you’re ahead of me: feedback loops. That’s correct.
 We needed more and more frequent feedback loops to map what
was happening now compared to what had just happened. That
helped us guess which futures were likely to emerge.
 It did not go unnoticed that we were manipulating information
a lot like computers. There were lots of “if-this-then-thats” with logic
gates AND OR and NOT between them.
 The way we were thinking was how our machines were thinking.
We built the machines but then the machines built simulated worlds
in our minds to match.
 Now there’s so much feedback it’s too big to manage. No, that’s
not quite right. There are too many feedback loops for the old
machinery to manage. We needed new machinery.
 And we got it. Or should I said we’ll get it? Both. We got it. And...
we’ll get it.
 See, the problem is obvious, isn’t it? As fast as we can dream or,
more accurately, as fast as the human-machine symbiosis can dream,
the thing is realized, if not in actual fact at least in a simulation. But
the machine doesn’t know the difference. And because we live
inside the mind space made by the machine, we don’t know the
Richard Thieme

difference either. The symbiot dreams and the dream becomes real.
Immediately.
 It can even become a thing of the past before it is manifest in the
present.
 By the time The Matrix was made, everybody understood. It
wasn’t science fiction, just a metaphorical adventure. Blade Runner
screened like history. It had already happened. The symbiot invents
memories at all levels from perception to conception. The symbiot
dreams and immediately believes the dream. The dream is reality
before we wake up. Or say that the dream takes place at a slower
pace than the implications of the dream, fed into a faster part of the
symbiot brain before the dream has ended. Like a spell-checker
finishing words for us. We’re still typing “spellche—“ but “spell-
checker” is already on the monitor.
 Some of our best dreams like getting lost and finding our way
home are over.
 We used to be able to get lost. It was exciting. Will it get dark
before we get home? Will they find us? Will some animal eat us?
 GPS killed that dream. Dreams predicated on being lost from
Homer’s Odyssey to Joyce’s Ulysses are dreams of the past. The
space into which we are all looking now is inside the sphere. Every-
body can see anything they want.
 This is why the soft stuff – humanities, history, theology – has
broken down.
 Deconstruction took apart the humanities and keeps on reduc-
ing whatever we find in any text to a lower level. It never ends. There
is nothing more fundamental to find that is also more real. Whatever
“real” means.
 History ended when we began inventing myths and narratives
to contain them. Need to know and compartmentalization finished
the job. Humans live in different niches, swimming in narrative

streams that do or don’t connect with one another. We look at
painted images on the gerbil tubes of our lives, thinking they’re
mirrors.
 Anyway, how would anyone know? And who might that person
be?
 Theology? Don’t make me laugh! Once we shake ourselves free
of Greek or medieval models, it turns into modular fluid construc-
tions that fly by like fractals animated by a fast processor. God is
interactive, morphing like us.
 OK, go back to that paragraph you just read beginning with GPS
about being lost. “Lost” was a metaphor. For everything I am talking
about. See? Shadows have vanished. Night-time is over. There is
bright light everywhere and those of us who have lived at the poles
know that makes us giddy.
 Think of the moon without a terminator. Night meets bright
with no liminal zone, no borderland or portal. The magic of twilight
has vanished.
 I could go on, but what’s the point? You get it, right? The flat
earth fills with streams of feedback overflowing their banks. As soon
as we dream of the future, trying to write science fiction, feedback
loops capture our dreams and deliver them to the recent past. By the
time we finish, the future is past. The symbiot anticipates the ending
and fills in the blanks, getting there before the author.
 Reality, that is, the information we call “reality,” happens so fast
from so many directions, so many flows, that it factors back into the
mindstream and makes reality one more dream. By the time we
wake up to that fact, it’s already morning.
 Real dreams, the ones that happen out there beyond our ability
to sense or know, come after the fact, not before, like before.
 Throw in non-local consciousness, using event horizons of black
holes to move around the galaxy, listen to our designer progeny

laughing at those who were merely born—what is there to write
about? As fast as we put finger to keyboard or voice to conversion
program, our visions are obsolete. Think up an original story, and
guess what? You can find it in some anthology a decade or three ago.
Or covert operations have already produced the miraculous shape-
changing metals, remote viewers and Psi spies, multi-Manchurian
candidates, anti-grav, you name it, they already made it and keep it
hidden. Aliens have come and gone, everybody who looks at the
evidence knows that, but so what? Contact is an empty set, a null set,
as boring as UFOs on Mars, a couple of big orange beach balls
bouncing down and delivering two little robots that crawl out and
drill and transmit, squeaking like R2D2.
 See what I mean? R2D2 in fact was squeaking like them. We just
didn’t know it yet.
 Vanity of vanities, saith this writer. All is vanity. I am a silver-
back, ancient of days, and I know: in my entire life, every idea I have
had, including the five or six that were terrific, had already been
thought. Every single one. Some were in books, some in blogs. Some
were footnotes, some mentioned casually over coffee. Originality no
longer exists. Creativity might be real but it’s an action in a collective
and nobody can claim credit for anything any more.
 Including this so-called work of science fiction. That “by-line” is
a joke. As if all this came from an “individual” with a boundary
around its brain!
 Besides, there’s not one original idea in this entire story.
 Some of you will insist this isn’t a story. It’s not fiction. It’s real,
you will say. In fact, of course, you already said it. This dream, you
said, is a string of obvious facts.
 But then, that’s the point, isn’t it? When I began this story, short
as it is, it was fiction. Now, just short of the end, it is not only fact, it

is fact of the past. I can hear you saying, I know that. Everybody
knows that.
 That’s how fast it happens.
 Others, of course, think this is a fictional narrative but like most
fiction, it’s a dust devil on Mars whirling past fast. Now you think it,
now you don’t. I mean, think it through. What have I actually said?
Nothing. Everything I mention—hard science like physics and biolo-
gy, soft science like soc and psych, social roles, what it means to be
human, alien visitation, time dilation – all of the themes of twenty-
first century science fiction have already come and gone. This is the
first century in history that lasted only five years. I don’t think it’s
fair even to call it a century anymore.
 So let’s agree on one thing: Everything is over. The feedback
machine is faster than we are. Individuals don’t exist. Dreams come
after reality, now, not before.
 A left brain civilization has gone so far to the left we’re right. The
circle is complete. The fractal is self-similar at all levels. Goedel said
it best: we can’t even say we’re here, doing this, except from some
other place. But when we go there, there we are, all over again. There
we all are, stuck once more. Inside a circle turned into a moebius
strip.
 There’s just no escaping the bad news.
 So do whatever you like with the rest of the story. Take the
narrative anywhere you want. I don’t care. Take the “I” or “we” or
whatever it is, take it away or take it apart. The “I” telling this story
is as insubstantial as smoke. So is the “we.” So, dear reader, are “you.”
 It’s all mist or haze or vapor or fog – they’re all words from the
built-in thesaurus anyhow, we all build with the same bricks—so
watch the smoke that we were once upon a time drift out of the

window and disperse in the wind, a colloidal mist that seems to
vanish in the empty air but is there forever.
 That’s what happened to science fiction.
 This is where or should I say when you found out.
 And that, I’m afraid, is the end of the story.
