Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-bring-your-javascript-
slot-machine-to-life has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it, and
include links to screenshots if possible.
Hi!
When I'm working on this way point I can only get as far as entering
$($('.slot')[0]).html(slotOne) before it freezes up and crashes. I tried
making it work on Safari and Google but they both crashed.
