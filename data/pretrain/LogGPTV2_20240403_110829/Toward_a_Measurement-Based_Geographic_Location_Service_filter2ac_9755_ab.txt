### 3. Distance Metrics and Similarity Measures

When \(\gamma = 1\), the Manhattan or city-block distance is obtained. Conversely, for \(\gamma = 2\), the Euclidean distance is derived. The Chebyshev distance, where \(\gamma = \infty\), can be expressed as:
\[ S_{\infty}(x, y) = \lim_{\gamma \to \infty} S_{\gamma}(x, y) = \max_i |x_i - y_i|. \]

Additionally, we consider the Canberra distance, defined as:
\[ S_{\text{canb}}(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{|x_i - y_i|}{x_i + y_i}, \]
where if both \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) are zero, the ratio of the difference to the sum is taken to be zero. The Canberra distance is suitable for variables taking non-negative values and is sensitive to small changes close to zero values [11].

The two delay patterns \(x\) and \(y\) can also be viewed as vectors in an \(N\)-dimensional delay space. The similarity \(S_{\cos}(x, y)\) between them is measured by computing the cosine of the angle \(\theta\) between these two vectors:
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \|y\|}, \]
where “\(\cdot\)” denotes the dot product of the two vectors, and \(\|x\|\) is the Euclidean norm of vector \(x \in \mathbb{R}^N\), i.e., \(\|x\| = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2}\).

An alternative measure of similarity is to compute the coefficient of correlation between the two delay patterns \(x\) and \(y\). This correlation-based similarity model is denoted by \(S_{\text{corr}}(x, y)\):
\[ \text{corr}(x, y) = \frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}, \]
where \(\sigma_{xy}\) is the covariance between delay patterns \(x\) and \(y\), and \(\sigma_x\) is the standard deviation of \(x\).

### 5. Experimental Results

In this paper, we analyze the results of live experiments to evaluate the basic properties of a measurement-based geographic location service for Internet hosts.

#### 5.1 Experimental Setup

For the experiments, we use 9 measurement boxes from the NIMI (National Internet Measurement Infrastructure) project [12] as our probe machines. These boxes are geographically distributed as follows: 5 in Western Europe, 3 in the U.S., and 1 in Japan. Recent works [4, 13] indicate that 7 to 9 dimensions provide sufficient network distance representation. The experimental set of landmarks comes from two datasets:

- **LibWeb**: This set of hosts is mainly composed of university sites extracted from library web (LibWeb) servers around the world [14].
- **RIPE**: These hosts are part of the Test Traffic Measurements (TTM) project of the RIPE network [15]. All hosts on the RIPE network are equipped with a GPS card, allowing their exact geographic position to be known.

The resulting experimental dataset totals 397 landmarks that are sparsely distributed worldwide. The geographic distribution of these landmarks is as follows: 199 in North America (U.S. and Canada), 156 in Western Europe, 19 in Eastern Europe, 13 in Latin America, 9 in Asia and Oceania, and 1 in the Middle East. This distribution is intended to at least roughly reflect the distribution of users (hosts) to be located. In a previous work [16], we proposed the demographic placement of landmarks to better represent the location of users (hosts). It should be noted that landmarks are unsuspecting participants in the procedure since a landmark may be any host with a known geographic location able to echo ping messages. Figure 2 shows the geographic location of the landmarks in the U.S. and in Western Europe, which are regions likely to have rich connectivity and host most users to be located.

The probe machines measure the delay toward the set of landmarks. The delay metric is actually the minimum of several RTT measurements to avoid taking into account congestion delays. The measurements toward each landmark from the different probe machines are spaced sufficiently to avoid triggering detection systems against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.

#### 5.2 Correlation between Geographic Distance and Network Delay

In this section, we evaluate the correlation between geographic distance and network delay. Until recently, common sense claimed that there is a weak correlation between distance and delay within the network. Claffy [17] mentions this as one of the myths about Internet data. Our results show that few landmarks present very large delays, probably due to poor connectivity. To avoid taking into account these outliers in our evaluation, we consider data within the 98th, 95th, and 90th percentiles of the measured network delay. The observed correlation between geographic distance and network delay is moderate to strong in these cases, resulting in \(R = 0.6229\), \(R = 0.8093\), and \(R = 0.8767\), respectively. Figures 3(a), 3(c), and 3(e) present the corresponding scatter plots for these results that cover landmarks located worldwide.

We also observe that poor connectivity weakens the correlation between geographic distance and network delay. We then identify the landmarks located in North America and Western Europe. These regions are likely to offer the richest connectivity linking their hosts. We observe an even stronger correlation in these well-connected regions, indicating that the correlation becomes stronger as connectivity becomes richer. The coefficients of correlation for the data within the 98th, 95th, and 90th percentiles in these well-connected regions are \(R = 0.7126\), \(R = 0.8595\), and \(R = 0.8958\), respectively. The corresponding scatter plots for these results are shown in Figures 3(b), 3(d), and 3(f) for landmarks located in North America and Western Europe (NA-WE). Recent findings [3, 18] indicate a strong correlation between population and router density in economically developed countries. Moreover, most users, and consequently most hosts to be located, are likely to be in these regions with richer connectivity, whereby a stronger correlation between distance and delay holds.

#### 5.3 Distance Accuracy

In this section, we consider the whole set of landmarks distributed worldwide, totaling 397 landmarks. To evaluate the distance accuracy, we take one landmark as a target host and use the remaining landmarks to infer a location estimation for this target. The distance accuracy is measured by the error distance from the location estimation to the location of the target host. We apply the different measures of dissimilarity presented in Section 3 to compare the delay patterns gathered by the probe machines from the landmarks.

Figure 4 shows the probability density function (PDF) of the error distance worldwide for the different measures of dissimilarity. The Canberra distance performs slightly better than the others, providing smaller error distances to more hosts. This distance measure is known to be suitable for non-negative values, such as network delay, and more sensitive to values near zero. This favors a more accurate location of some hosts in comparison with the other measures of dissimilarity since eight out of the nine probe machines are in the U.S. or in Western Europe. For the Canberra distance, we observe that the median value of the error distance is 314 km with a kurtosis of 40.79, showing that the observed distribution of the error distance is heavy-tailed. This is because, for some target hosts, even if the elected landmark is the geographically closest landmark to the target, it is not necessarily nearby the target host. These results indicate that delay measurements can indeed be exploited to determine the geographic location of Internet hosts, although at a coarse granularity.

### 6. Conclusion

This paper investigates key properties toward a measurement-based geographic location service for Internet hosts. Such a service can be viewed as an underlying infrastructure for the deployment of novel location-aware applications in the Internet. Live experiments have been carried out to evaluate the correlation between geographic distance and network delay, as well as the achieved distance accuracy for different measures of dissimilarity. Our findings indicate that contrary to conventional wisdom, there is a significant correlation between geographic distance and network delay. We show that this correlation can be exploited to provide a coarse-grained geographic location of Internet hosts. The location estimation of a host is the location of the landmark presenting the most similar delay pattern with respect to the target host. This poses a fundamental limit: the system has a discrete space of answers since the number of possible answers corresponds to the number of landmarks adopted.

As future work, we intend to investigate methods to adopt a continuous space of answers instead of a discrete one. Recent works [13, 19, 20] propose to infer network proximity without direct measurements by embedding network distances such as delay into a coordinate system of reduced dimensions. Similar concepts can be applied to the measurement-based geographic location of Internet hosts to provide more accurate estimations using fewer measurements.
