ABSTRACT
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the primary routing protocol
for the Internet backbone, yet it lacks adequate security mecha-
nisms. While simple BGP hijack attacks only involve an adversary
hijacking Internet traffic destined to a victim, more complex and
challenging interception attacks require that adversary intercept a
victim’s traffic and forward it on to the victim. If an interception
attack is launched incorrectly, the adversary’s attack will disrupt
its route to the victim making it impossible to forward packets. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce SICO attacks (Surgical
Interception using COmmunities): a novel method of launching
interception attacks that leverages BGP communities to scope an
adversary’s attack and ensure a route to the victim. We then show
how SICO attacks can be targeted to specific source IP addresses
for reducing attack costs. Furthermore, we ethically perform SICO
attacks on the real Internet backbone to evaluate their feasibility
and effectiveness. Results suggest that SICO attacks can achieve
interception even when previously proposed attacks would not
be feasible and outperforms them by attracting traffic from an
additional 16% of Internet hosts (worst case) and 58% of Internet
hosts (best case). Finally, we analyze the Internet topology to find
that at least 83% of multi-homed ASes are capable of launching
these attacks.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) allows ISPs throughout the
world to exchange routing information and is the primary routing
protocol for the backbone of the Internet. However, because BGP
was first drafted in 1989 [71], BGP contains no means of crypto-
graphically verifying the authenticity of routes which allows an
Autonomous System (AS) to lie about what routes it has. This
fundamental flaw in BGP allows for BGP attacks where an ad-
versary announces a route in BGP that it does not actually have.
BGP attacks are routinely seen in the wild and have compromised
sensitive communications from cryptocurrencies [49] to financial
services data [60].
In a simple BGP attack (known as a BGP hijack) the adversary
attracts traffic for the victim’s prefix, and either answers or drops
that traffic. However, more advanced attacks (like traffic analysis
against Tor [83]) require an adversary to intercept network traffic
and forward it on to the intended recipient (i.e., the victim of
the attack). These BGP interception attacks are more difficult to
perform because the adversary must successfully forward pack-
ets to the victim. This is a key challenge, since the adversary’s
BGP announcement can disrupt its own valid route to the victim,
making the adversary unable to deliver packets to the victim and
perform interception.
Contributions: In this paper, we present SICO (Surgical Interception
using COmmunities) attacks, a novel method of performing BGP in-
terception attacks that increases both the viability and effectiveness
of these attacks by exploiting BGP communities. BGP communities
can be used by an AS to influence the propagation of its route at re-
mote ASes, which is commonly used for network traffic engineering.
However, as in our attacks, this feature also helps an adversary to
control the propagation of a malicious route. By using communities,
SICO restricts the propagation of the adversary’s BGP announce-
ment to only where necessary to achieve interception, while the
adversary’s route to the victim is still preserved. This fine-grained
propagation control enables SICO to achieve traffic interception in
cases when using previously proposed attacks [46, 59] would be
difficult or even impossible.
Furthermore, we extend SICO to allow for targeted interception.
In this variant, an interception attack is engineered to affect only
select source IP addresses and affect as less Internet as possible.
We achieve targeted interception by using BGP communities to
suppress unwanted route propagation while still attracting traffic
from the target source IP addresses. Targeted interception decreases
the detectability of an attack because fewer ASes would be seeing
the malicious route. In addition, targeted interception allows the
adversary to more realistically handle the bandwidth required

terception, and minimizes the effect on round-trip time introduced
by interception.
We evaluate SICO attacks by launching them on the real In-
ternet backbone in an ethical manner (i.e., attacking our own IP
prefixes), and study the Internet topology to better understand
how many ASes can launch SICO attacks. Some highlights of our
results include:
AS topologies.
• We verified the feasibility of SICO attacks under various
• SICO outperforms previous techniques by allowing an ad-
versary to attract traffic from an additional 16% of Internet
hosts (worst case) and 58% of Internet hosts (best case).
• When targeting just the IP of the highest bandwidth Tor
node, targeted interception attacks can effectively reduce the
number of intercepted hosts compared to previous attacks,
while still being able to intercept the traffic from the target
IP to the victim.
• Our evaluation of the viability of SICO suggests that at least
48% of total ASes (or 83% of multi-homed ASes) are capable
of launching SICO.
We hope that our work serves to inspire the real-world de-
ployment of secure countermeasures, including RPKI [50] and
BGPSec [69], which have not been widely deployed yet.
2 OVERVIEW OF BGP
2.1 BGP routing policies
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) allows independently operated
networks (known as Autonomous Systems or ASes) to exchange
routing information with each other. In BGP, an AS makes a BGP
announcement to its neighbors to advertise its routing informa-
tion (IP prefixes), and includes its Autonomous System Number
(ASN) in the AS-path field of the announcement. The neighbors
then decide if this BGP announcement represents their preferred
way to route packets for a given IP prefix. If so, these neighbors
can further forward this announcement to their neighbors. We
introduce three aspects of BGP in this section.
Filtering routes with loops. When announcements are forwarded,
ASes add their own ASNs to the AS-path field so that AS-path
contains a list of all the ASes the packets will traverse to reach their
destination. The AS-path field prevents loops because an AS will
not import a route if its own ASN is already in the AS-path field of
the route announcement [75].
Selecting a route. When an AS hears two BGP announcements
for the same IP prefix, it uses a series of tiebreakers to determine
which route it will use. The first tiebreaker is local preference. Local
preference is AS-specific and is often based on which type of
neighbor a route is learned from. Routes learned from customers
are preferred over routes learned from peers, which are preferred
over routes learned from providers. The next tiebreaker is AS-
path length: ASes prefer routes with shorter AS paths. Finally, in
the case of a tie on both local preference and AS-path lengths,
routes are compared based on the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) 1
1IGP is the routing protocol used to route traffic within an AS (e.g., OSPF).

respectively.
metric of the next-hop router for each route. We note that other
tiebreakers also exist, but do not impact our attacks, as discussed
in Appendix §A.
The above tiebreakers are only used in the case of BGP an-
nouncements for the exact same prefix. If a router hears a BGP
announcement for a more specific prefix and an announcement for
a shorter, more general prefix, the route for the more specific prefix
is always used.
Exporting routes based on business relationships. Based on
the Gao-Rexford model [55], the main business relationships be-
tween ASes are customer-provider and peer-to-peer. An AS A is a
customer of a neighbor B (i.e., the provider) if A pays B for accessing
Internet, and is a peer of a neighbor C if A and C can exchange traffic
between each other and between their customers free-of-charge.
The type of neighbor the routes are learned from determines the
neighbors the routes will be announced to. More specifically, routes
learned from customers are announced to all neighbors, but routes
learned from peers and providers are only announced to customers.
See Figure 1 for an example.
2.2 BGP interception attacks
BGP attacks involve an AS making BGP announcements to ma-
liciously attract traffic destined to another AS’s prefix, and have
been traditionally divided into two categories based on how the
attacks impact the data plane [46]. The first category is BGP hijack
attacks where an adversary uses a malicious BGP announcement
to attract traffic destined to a victim AS, but the adversary does
not actually deliver this traffic to the victim. The second category
of BGP attacks is interception attacks where an adversary attracts
traffic destined to a victim and then routes this traffic through to
the victim.
Motivation for interception. The capability of forwarding inter-
cepted traffic back to the victim AS enables interception attacks
to bootstrap more sophisticated attacks, such as traffic correlation
attacks against anonymous networks [83] and man-in-the-middle
attacks against certificate authorities [47]. Though hijack attacks
can be effective for many adversarial objectives (e.g., setting up
phishing websites and spoofing DNS responses [49]), they disrupt

In contrast, inter-
ception attacks preserve connectivity in the data plane, making
them much harder to detect than hijack attacks (as seen in [77,
86], data-plane connectivity is a common method for detecting
hijack attacks).
Methods of maintaining connectivity. In interception attacks,
the adversary builds valid route(s) from an adversary AS to the
victim AS via either announcement shaping (strategically crafting
bogus BGP announcements so that the adversary’s AS itself still
has a valid route to the victim) or tunneling (encapsulating the
traffic and sending it to a remote destination with a valid route to
the victim where it is unencapsulated). We focus on announcement
shaping because tunneling requires either a colluding AS, which
is beyond the scope of our threat model, or a remote host that is
capable of spoofing source IP addresses to make the tunneled traffic
have different source IP addresses).2 Based on the CAIDA spoofer
project [42] only 8% of IP blocks allow end hosts to spoof source IP
addresses, meaning that it may be difficult for an adversary to find
an acceptable end host to use for tunneling. In addition, tunneling
incurs significant additional communication resources (since the
adversary must now route the victim’s traffic through the Internet
at each tunneling end-point instead of only at its own AS) and
needlessly increases TCP latency when compared to announce-
ment shaping. Finally, we later demonstrate that announcement
shaping can be extended to launch targeted attacks, which cannot
be achieved with tunneling alone.
Achieving announcement shaping. To achieve announcement
shaping, the adversary usually adopts two techniques: AS-path
poisoning [75] and selective neighbor announcement [46, 82].
In AS-path poisoning, the adversary adds a valid route to the
victim in the AS path of the bogus announcement and announces
that the adversary AS can reach the victim via that route. The ASes
on the valid route between the adversary and the victim will ignore
this announcement because of BGP loop prevention and deliver the
traffic from the adversary normally to the victim, while the other
ASes that are not on that route may prefer the bogus announcement
and deliver their traffic to the adversary.
Selective neighbor announcement exploits routers’ local prefer-
ence to prevent routing loops. The adversary announces to selected
neighbors that the adversary AS originates the victim’s IP prefix,
based on the business relation between the adversary, the victim,
and their neighbors. To help better understand this process, we
show the route an AS prefers when learning two routes from
different types of neighbors in Table 1. For instance, if the ad-
versary delivers traffic to the victim using a valid route learned
from a customer or peer, the adversary can announce the bogus
route to all its neighbors. The announcements for the valid route
only traverse customer-provider edges. Because of the business
relationship preferences discussed above, all of the ASes along the
valid route will ignore the bogus route, since they will learn the
2Alternately, an adversary could use network address translation with overloading
(a.k.a. port address translation) to rewrite the source IP address of all traffic that is
passing through and avoid the need to spoof, but this will break any connections that
are initiated by the victim’s end hosts and cause a noticeable anomaly since a large
number of connections are from the same source IP address.

bogus route from a provider or peer (unlike the valid route that is
heard from a customer).
2.3 BGP community
BGP communities are optional attributes that can be added to a
BGP announcement for controlling the routing policy in upstream
ASes. There are a small set of standardized communities defined
by RFCs (e.g., RFC 1997, RFC 3765, RFC 7999 [51, 61, 64]). However,
the vast majority of community use is non-standardized and varies
from AS to AS.
Previous works have proposed more extensive standardization
as well as security improvements for BGP communities [76], but
these proposals have not seen widespread adoption. Although
communities are often not standardized, there are common themes
in how communities are used which have been explored by previous
work [53, 81]. One type of communities is information communities
that are added to a route by an AS to signal properties about that
route (e.g., what Internet exchange the route was learned at or
whether it was learned from a peer or customer). Another type
is action communities, which are added to a route to cause an AS
further down the path to perform a specific action related to this
route. A common example of a community performing an action is
the use of communities to remotely trigger black hole filtering (as
documented in [67]). Despite common themes, there are no limits
on the potential uses of communities because any community can
