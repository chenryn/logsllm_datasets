Question: "In designing a network architecture for an organization that is concerned about adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks, how would implementing network segmentation contribute to mitigating the risk of such attacks?"
 "A": "Network segmentation allows for better traffic analysis by aggregating all network traffic into a single segment for easier monitoring."
 "B": "Network segmentation increases the attack surface by creating more network segments, making it easier for adversaries to find vulnerable points."
 "C": "Network segmentation can isolate critical systems and limit the scope of AiTM activity by controlling access to various network segments."
 "D": "Network segmentation simplifies network protocols, thereby reducing the likelihood of protocol vulnerabilities that can be exploited for AiTM attacks."
Answer: C
