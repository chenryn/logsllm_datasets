### Describe the bug
Hello everyone,
I am using SQLAlchemy 1.4 with Postgresql. I am trying to populate some tables
with a large number of records, with some not conforming to expectations. I
have been using the following syntax:
`db.execute(insert(Table).values(records).on_conflict_do_nothing())` to
resolve issues with duplicates.  
However, as expected some of the records have issues of another nature and I
want to skip them and retrieve them. I decided to use SAVEPOINTs
(`begin_nested()`) and `rollback()`. This led to an error I am not able to
resolve mentioned in the title: `"Can't reconnect until invalid savepoint
transaction is rolled back"`.
In the code you will notice I am using a context manager for the save points,
I would like to point out that I get the same error when using explicit
rollbacks without a context manager.
Thank you for your time!
### To Reproduce
    engine = _sql.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
    SessionLocal = _orm.sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
    Base = _declarative.declarative_base()
    def get_session():
        session = SessionLocal()
        try:
            yield session
        finally:
            db.close()
    def _bulk_insert(records: list, table, session):
        failed_records = []
        try:
            with session.begin_nested() as transaction:
                transaction.session.execute(insert(table).values(records).on_conflict_do_nothing())
            print(‘Bulk insert successful without any errors’)
            return failed_records
        except Exception:
            print(‘Failed to do general bulk insert, starting chunks...’)
        for chunk in np.array_split(records, 10):
            try:
                with session.begin_nested() as transaction:
                    transaction.session.execute(insert(table).values(chunk.tolist()).on_conflict_do_nothing())
            except Exception:
                failed_items.extend(chunk)
        if len(items) != len(failed_records) and len(failed_records)>0:
            return _bulk_insert(failed_records, table, db)
        return failed_items
