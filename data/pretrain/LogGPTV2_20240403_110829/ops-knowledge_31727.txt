User: I'm building custom CRM web based system and have integrated synchronization of contacts and reminders with Google apps and need do the same with Apple iCloud. Is there any way how to do it? I haven't find any official API for this purpose, CRM is written in PHP, but I'm able to use python for this purpose as well.
Assistant: To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to interface with iCloud directly; it can only be done through an iOS or Mac OS app, and by calling the correct iCloud Objective-C APIs with UI/NSDocument classes. Since you are not using Cocoa, let alone Objective-C, you will most likely not be able to do this. I may be wrong of course, as I haven't conducted an in-depth search into this.
