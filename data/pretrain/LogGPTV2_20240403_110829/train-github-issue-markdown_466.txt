## 📝 Provide detailed reproduction steps (if any)
  1. Set Allow Zones to span across monitors = YES
  2. Set Show Zones on all Monitors while dragging = YES
  3. Create 8 custom zones - 3 on left monitor; 3 on middle; 2 on right.
  4. Apply custom zone
  5. Drag window  
NOTE - Settings Toggled: "Hold-Shift" (tried both on/off); "Show Zones on all
Monitors..." (tried both on/off); "Allow zones to span across monitors" (tried
on/off).
### ✔️ Expected result
Show zones....
### ❌ Actual result
Does NOT show zones  
NOTE: The App works fine IF I Turn OFF "Allow Zones to span across monitors",
but it then only shows on the main monitor which is not my intent. ODDLY -
despite being toggle to "NOT" span monitors - it does now in a defunct manor

THEN I TRY - "Allow zones to span across monitors" = ON and reapply Custom
zone (Fancy Zones shows NO zones)

THEN I SWAP BACK to "Allow zones to span across monitors" = OFF (Fancy Zones
shows only 5 of the 8 zones but they're spanning the primary monitor, spilling
halfway onto the right monitor - however the zones disappear if I move my
mouse off of primary (middle) monitor)

8-Zone Custom: MOUSE CANNOT CROSS PRIMARY MONITOR THRESHOLD without Zones
disappearing; NOTE ALSO - 3 of the 8 zones are missing

SAME THING HAPPENS IF I USE MY 3-Zone Custom template --> MONITOR SPAN = OFF,
BUT IT'S NOW WORKING ACROSS MONITORS BUT IN A DEFUNCT MANOR - Notice Zone 2
Label is missing & if drag over to Zone 2 or 3, it makes the window Cover both
2, 3, and the remaining Non-Zone left on the right monitor.
