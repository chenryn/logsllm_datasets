### Introduction
- **Identity and Role**: I am associated with Airscanner.com, a company focused on mobile security solutions including antivirus (AV), firewall, and network sniffer technologies. My role involves disseminating information about the importance of ethical practices in reverse engineering, understanding one's computer, and supporting software developers by paying for their work.

### Legal Considerations
- **Circumvention of Technological Measures**:
  - No individual is permitted to circumvent technological measures that control access to copyrighted works.
  - "Circumventing a technological measure" includes descrambling, decrypting, or otherwise bypassing, removing, deactivating, or impairing such measures without the copyright owner's authorization.
- **Encryption Research and Security Testing**:
  - Researchers are allowed to identify and analyze flaws and vulnerabilities in encryption technologies applied to copyrighted works.
  - Accessing a computer system solely for investigating a security flaw or vulnerability is permissible under certain conditions.

### Windows CE Architecture
- **Processors**:
  - **Power and Processing**: The relationship between power, processing, and heat generation.
  - **Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)**: ARM processors (1987) such as StrongARM and Xscale, used in WinCE, ARM Linux, and EPOC.
  - **Intel Acquisition**: Intel acquired DEC (StrongARM) and introduced larger cache, dynamic voltage, and more transistors (2.5 million in StrongARM, 5 million in Xscale), enabling lower power usage at higher speeds.
- **Kernel and Processes**:
  - **Kernel**: Reduced from Windows 2000, excluding 16-bit and MS-DOS support. Core DLL issues and ROM-based execution prevent breaking programs during DLL code execution.
  - **Processes**: Up to 32 processes, each with dedicated 32MB of memory, using 512x64k memory blocks and 16 registers per thread. Processes run in Kernel (OS) and User (3rd party) modes, with isolated processes but shared data among threads.
- **Memory**:
  - **RAM**: Stores programs and objects, which are lost upon power loss.
  - **ROM**: Stores OS files, uses compression, and supports eXecute In Place (XIP) to save memory.
  - **Object Store**: Manages configuration settings, compressed 3rd party programs, and structured storage databases.
- **Graphics, Windowing, and Event Subsystem (GWES)**:
  - Handles all messaging, including popups, and provides functions like `PostMessage`, `SendMessage`, and `SendThreadMessage`.
- **Scheduler**:
  - Manages multitasking by assigning processor time at the thread level.

### Reverse Engineering Fundamentals
- **Prerequisites**:
  - Understanding Assembly (ASM) concepts, hexadecimal, binary, ASCII, and decimal conversions.
  - Knowledge of ARM processor architecture, including registers and opcodes.
- **ARM Registers**:
  - 37 total 32-bit registers, with varying purposes depending on mode.
  - Key registers: Program Counter (PC, R15), Link Register (LR, R14), Stack Pointer (SP, R13), and Status Flags (NZCO).
- **ARM Opcodes**:
  - **Move (MOV)**: Example: `MOV R3, R1` (01 30 A0 E1), `MOV R2, #1` (01 20 A0 E3).
  - **Compare (CMP)**: Example: `CMP R2, R3` (03 00 52 E1), `CMP R4, #1` (01 00 54 E3).
- **Status Flags**:
  - Used in operations like `CMP` and `MOVS` to set and check status flags (N, Z, C, V).

### Practical Example
- **Code Snippet**:
  ```cpp
  if (strLength > 8) {
      MessageBox(strToShort);
  } else {
      if (strSerial == m_Serial) {
          MessageBox(strValid);
      } else {
          MessageBox(strInvalid);
      }
  }
  ```

### Summary
- **Tools**:
  - Disassembler, Debugger, Hex Editor.
- **ARM Processor**:
  - Opcodes and Registers.
- **Reverse Engineering Process**:
  - Locate weaknesses, monitor execution, and apply patches.
