User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 lack_of_statistics 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This piece of code checks for the presence of updated statistics in the business table. If the statistics have not been updated for a long time, it may lead to a serious decline in the execution plan. The code identifies abnormal tables by comparing the difference in tuples with the tuple_number_threshold. If any abnormal tables are found, the code suggests updating the statistics in a timely manner to help the planner choose the most suitable plan. If no abnormal tables are found, lack of statistics is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- data_changed_delay
- tuples_diff
- schema_name
- table_name
