User: Answer the question about Azure Data Explorer Ingestion monitoring, metrics, and errors:
How can I monitor ingestion issues?

n
Assistant: You can monitor ingestion [using metrics](../../using-metrics.md#ingestion-metrics), and by [setting up and using ingestion diagnostic logs](../../using-diagnostic-logs.md) for detailed table-level monitoring, viewing detailed ingestion error codes, and so on. 
You can select specific metrics to track, choose how to aggregate your results, and create metric charts to view on your dashboard. See more about [streaming metrics](../../using-metrics.md#streaming-ingest-metrics) and [how to monitor queued ingestion](../../monitor-queued-ingestion.md).
