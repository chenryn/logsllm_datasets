2. Methodology and Attack Demos
2.6.3 Contact Tracing
Given that RTLS offer the possibility of tracking a person’s 
movements inside a wide variety of facilities, and the 
more and more widespread requirements imposed by the 
COVID-19 pandemic of having a way to keep track of close 
contacts among people, vendors have started offering 
contact tracing functionalities. By considering factors such 
as contact duration, presence of barriers, or even the usage 
of shared tools for more complex solutions, an RTLS can 
estimate the risk that a person has contracted a certain 
disease given a set of positive individuals.
As with the previously described use cases, such a feature 
can become a target for malicious actors. Some examples 
of attacks that can be enacted follow:
 y An attacker can induce false contacts among people, 
aiming to cause a certain group of victims to be 
erroneously considered at high risk of being positive, 
thus being forced to preventively quarantine; 
 y An attacker can prevent the detection of true contacts 
among people, with the aim of facilitating the spread 
of COVID-19 or other illnesses throughout a company, 
resulting in downtime due to mass employee quarantine 
that could have long-term effects (especially for 
immune-compromised personnel).
All aforementioned attack scenarios require an attacker to 
actively manipulate the network traffic, in order to change the 
position of a tag at will. This can be done exactly as described 
in the previous chapter. Of the two analyzed solutions, only 
the Sewio RTLS offered a contact tracing functionality via tag 
zones: by defining a validity radius for each tag, a contact is 
recorded if two tag circles experience a contact event.
In our tests, it was possible to develop a Python script 
capable of interfering with the contact tracing functionality 
offered by Sewio, as shown in Figures 55 and 56. Notably, 
the script managed to:
 y Generate false contact events among arbitrary tags;
 y Prevent true contacts among tags being detected.

Again, no warnings or abnormal behavior that may have 
alerted an operator were noticeable, as the injected positions 
mimicked the natural movements of the target tag, which 
were previously studied in the reconnaissance phase. 
To prevent malicious actors from immediately reusing our 
results and performing attacks against real-world RTLS, the

UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
Among the possible remediations that an end 
user can implement, the most effective ones 
are segregation and firewall rules, application 
of intrusion detection systems (IDS), and traffic 
encryption. This section presents each of 
these possible remediations and evaluates the 
advantages and challenges of each option.
As mentioned before, one of the most stringent 
requirements for the success of an attack is that an 
adversary has a foothold on the same subnet where the 
UWB RTLS is installed. Thus, a first mitigation to these 
attacks is to move the entire UWB RTLS backhaul network 
to a segregated network, and secure the access to the 
network both physically and logically, with the aim of 
preventing unauthorized actors from gaining access to it. 
This is now mandated by some RTLS vendors26, as shown 
in Figure 57.

While traditional solutions taken from the IT domain such 
as VLANs, IEEE 802.1X, or firewall rules can be greatly 
effective for this purpose, some challenging aspects need 
to be considered.
The RTLS server is a critical component to protect in an 
UWB RTLS backhaul network, as, by design, it needs to 
listen to all incoming communications from the anchor 
network and, at the same time, be accessible by the 
operators monitoring it. 
The majority of the time, the RTLS server will be hosted 
on a bare metal or virtual computer with two network 
interfaces, one attached to the backhaul network, the other 
attached to a management network. While designing 
the firewall rules, it must be kept in mind that some RTLS 
may be configured to expose core network services on 
all interfaces by default. For instance, we noticed that 
both Sewio RTLS and Avalue RTLS, as shown in Figure 58 
and Figure 59, exposed the services responsible for the 
processing of packets from the anchors on all interfaces. 
Although no meaningful attacks can be done without 
the synchronization and positioning timestamps, there 
might be room for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks from 
the management network if these services are not filtered 
via specific firewall rules. By executing a DoS attack, an 
adversary may temporarily halt the continuous update of 
tag positions, potentially impeding geofencing rules or 
contact tracing features from correctly operating for a short 
amount of time.

Finally, it must be considered that, even if security 
measures are adopted to enforce network segregation, 
the lack of transport protection measures in the protocol 
design of RTLS remains. If an attacker were able to 
physically attach to the wired network (for instance, by 
cutting a wire and connecting a device in the middle) or 
managed to obtain the wireless password (for instance, by 
cracking a WPA2-PSK handshake), there would be nothing 
preventing an attacker from successfully accomplishing the 
attacks described in this white paper, even in the presence 
of access control measures. Thus, a continuous monitoring 
of the physical status of the wired network must be 
enforced, or periodic wireless password rotation and other 
wireless security best practices must be strictly followed.
Another fundamental requirement for the success of 
an attack is that an adversary must first perform a MitM 
to obtain all necessary synchronization and positioning 
timestamps, which are not normally sent via broadcast 
packets. Consequently, another possible mitigation is 
to install an IDS in the UWB RTLS backhaul network. By 
monitoring for signatures such as new ARP frames or 
new links between nodes (that an attacker is bound to 
generate), an IDS can quickly detect an ongoing MitM, as 
shown in Figure 60.
3.2 Intrusion Detection Systems

3. Remediations
Figure 61 - SSH tunnel PoC on Avalue RTLS.
Like the previous mitigation, it is still inherently vulnerable 
to an attacker that performs a physical MitM: if they were 
able to physically attach to the wired network, or managed 
to obtain the wireless password, an intrusion detection 
system would be unable to discriminate between an attack 
taking place and legitimate traffic, even when featuring 
application layer inspection functionalities. As a matter 
of fact, even in the case of an active traffic manipulation 
attack, the tampered traffic would be indistinguishable from 
legitimately generated traffic if crafted by an attacker with 
prior knowledge of a given target’s normal movements.
The most effective mitigation that an asset owner can 
apply is to add a traffic encryption layer on top of the 
existing communications, to prevent even a physical MitM 
from successfully tampering with the systems. This option 
was actually tested on the Avalue RTLS, as it was the only 
solution that allowed administrative access to the RTLS 
server as well as the anchors.
As a proof of concept, with the goal of using already 
available tools, we attempted to encrypt all traffic 
generated by the anchors by encapsulating it through 
an SSH tunnel. First, a classic SSH tunnel was created, by 
connecting each anchor to an SSH service exposed by the 
RTLS server and setting up a local port forwarding service. 
Then, an instance of code was run on the server and all 
anchors, to create the UDP to TCP (and vice versa) bridges 
that are necessary to tunnel the network traffic generated 
by the anchors (that is UDP) inside SSH (that supports 
only TCP) and then back to UDP for the server processing. 
Finally, all anchors were configured to send all traffic to the 
internal service exposed by the code instances running on 
them. A result of the experiment is depicted in Figure 61.
3.3 Traffic Encryption
55
WHITE PAPER
UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
3. Remediations
As can be noticed by the evidence, the PoC was successful: 
all traffic generated by the anchors to the server was 
tunneled inside SSH and, consequently, protected from 
any MitM attacks, while at the same time preserving the 
basic RTLS functionality. However, even in this case, some 
challenges need to be solved.
First, the extra effort produced by the SSH tunnelling 
increased the load of the anchors and, eventually, led to 
a perceived delay of the RTLS server with respect to the 
real-time tag positions. To counteract this effect, it was 
necessary to increase the period of synchronization packets 
from the default 150 ms to 500 ms to decrease the number 
of communications generated by the anchors, at the 
expense of a reduced position accuracy. This might be a 
problem for some asset owners that need real-time, precise 
tag positioning.
Finally, the possibility of enabling such encryption layers on 
top of the already existing technologies depends entirely 
on the accessibility of the RTLS server and anchors from 
the vendor. If either the server or the anchors do not allow 
administrative access (as was the case with the Sewio RTLS, 
whose anchors do not expose any SSH access), enacting 
this solution either requires an extensive work of firmware 
modification to enable it, or is simply not viable.

UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
UWB RTLS are becoming increasingly common as both 
businesses and individuals see the benefits to utilizing 
this technology to increase efficiency, productivity, and 
location accuracy of people and assets. Although the 
IEEE 802.15.4z amendment was aimed at increasing the 
security of UWB, the design of securing critical protocols 
was “out of scope” and left completely up to vendors 
who may or may not know how to implement this type of 
security at the device level.
After conducting research on two popular UWB RTLS 
on the market, Nozomi Networks Labs discovered 
zero-day vulnerabilities that threat actors can exploit 
to disrupt and manipulate various environments. Our 
assessment of these protocols in two popular UWB RTLS 
revealed security flaws that could allow an attacker to 
gain full access to sensitive data exchanged over-the-air 
and impact people's safety. In this paper we provided 
mitigations that individuals as well as asset owners can 
implement right away to help mitigate these risks. 
We believe that this work is important because of the 
potential impact on people's lives if threat actors were 
able to exploit the vulnerabilities identified in our research. 
We hope that by releasing this information publicly 
we will help raise awareness about how important it 
is for companies who operate critical infrastructure 
systems such as airports, hospitals, power plants 
and manufacturing facilities to ensure the security of 
their networks to reduce the susceptibility of being 
compromised by a malicious attacker.
