# UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice

## 2. Methodology and Attack Demos

### 2.6.3 Contact Tracing

Real-Time Locating Systems (RTLS) offer the capability to track a person's movements within a wide variety of facilities. Given the increasing requirements imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic for tracking close contacts among people, vendors have started offering contact tracing functionalities. By considering factors such as contact duration, presence of barriers, or even the usage of shared tools, an RTLS can estimate the risk that a person has contracted a certain disease given a set of positive individuals.

As with the previously described use cases, such features can become targets for malicious actors. Some examples of potential attacks include:

- **False Contacts:** An attacker can induce false contacts among people, aiming to cause a certain group of victims to be erroneously considered at high risk of being positive, thus forcing them into preventive quarantine.
- **Undetected True Contacts:** An attacker can prevent the detection of true contacts among people, facilitating the spread of COVID-19 or other illnesses throughout a company. This could result in downtime due to mass employee quarantines, with long-term effects, especially for immune-compromised personnel.

All these attack scenarios require the attacker to actively manipulate network traffic to change the position of a tag at will. This can be done as described in the previous chapter. Of the two analyzed solutions, only the Sewio RTLS offered a contact tracing functionality via tag zones: by defining a validity radius for each tag, a contact is recorded if two tag circles experience a contact event.

In our tests, we developed a Python script capable of interfering with the contact tracing functionality offered by Sewio, as shown in Figures 55 and 56. The script managed to:
- Generate false contact events among arbitrary tags.
- Prevent true contacts among tags from being detected.

**Figure 56: Active Traffic Manipulation Attack Against Sewio RTLS – Preventing a True Contact.**

**Figure 55: Active Traffic Manipulation Attack Against Sewio RTLS – Generating a False Contact.**

No warnings or abnormal behavior that might alert an operator were noticeable, as the injected positions mimicked the natural movements of the target tag, which were previously studied in the reconnaissance phase. To prevent malicious actors from immediately reusing our results and performing attacks against real-world RTLS, the code of the script is not being released with this white paper.

## 3. Remediations

### 3.1 Segregation and Firewall Rules

Among the possible remediations that an end user can implement, the most effective ones are segregation and firewall rules, application of intrusion detection systems (IDS), and traffic encryption. This section presents each of these possible remediations and evaluates their advantages and challenges.

One of the most stringent requirements for the success of an attack is that an adversary has a foothold on the same subnet where the UWB RTLS is installed. Thus, a first mitigation is to move the entire UWB RTLS backhaul network to a segregated network and secure access to the network both physically and logically. This is now mandated by some RTLS vendors, as shown in Figure 57.

**Figure 57: Siemens RTLS4030G Operating Instructions.**
*Source: "Simatic RTLS Localization System Simatic RTLS4030G Operating Instructions," Siemens, April 2021.*

While traditional IT solutions such as VLANs, IEEE 802.1X, or firewall rules can be highly effective, some challenging aspects need to be considered. The RTLS server is a critical component to protect, as it needs to listen to all incoming communications from the anchor network and be accessible by operators monitoring it.

The RTLS server is typically hosted on a bare metal or virtual computer with two network interfaces: one attached to the backhaul network and the other to a management network. When designing firewall rules, it must be kept in mind that some RTLS may be configured to expose core network services on all interfaces by default. For instance, we noticed that both Sewio RTLS and Avalue RTLS exposed the services responsible for processing packets from the anchors on all interfaces (Figures 58 and 59). Although no meaningful attacks can be done without synchronization and positioning timestamps, there might be room for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks from the management network if these services are not filtered via specific firewall rules. A DoS attack could temporarily halt the continuous update of tag positions, potentially impeding geofencing rules or contact tracing features.

**Figure 59: Avalue RTLS Listening Ports.**

### 3.2 Intrusion Detection Systems

Finally, it must be considered that, even if security measures are adopted to enforce network segregation, the lack of transport protection measures in the protocol design of RTLS remains. If an attacker were able to physically attach to the wired network or obtain the wireless password, they could still successfully accomplish the attacks described in this white paper, even in the presence of access control measures. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the physical status of the wired network and periodic wireless password rotation must be strictly followed.

Another fundamental requirement for the success of an attack is that an adversary must first perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to obtain necessary synchronization and positioning timestamps. Consequently, another possible mitigation is to install an IDS in the UWB RTLS backhaul network. By monitoring for signatures such as new ARP frames or new links between nodes, an IDS can quickly detect an ongoing MitM, as shown in Figure 60.

**Figure 60: Nozomi Networks Guardian Detecting the MitM Attack Against Sewio RTLS.**

Like the previous mitigation, an IDS is still inherently vulnerable to a physical MitM. If an attacker can physically attach to the wired network or obtain the wireless password, the IDS would be unable to distinguish between an attack and legitimate traffic, even with application layer inspection functionalities.

### 3.3 Traffic Encryption

The most effective mitigation that an asset owner can apply is to add a traffic encryption layer on top of existing communications to prevent even a physical MitM from tampering with the systems. This option was tested on the Avalue RTLS, as it was the only solution that allowed administrative access to the RTLS server and anchors.

As a proof of concept, we attempted to encrypt all traffic generated by the anchors by encapsulating it through an SSH tunnel. First, a classic SSH tunnel was created by connecting each anchor to an SSH service exposed by the RTLS server and setting up a local port forwarding service. Then, an instance of code was run on the server and all anchors to create the UDP to TCP (and vice versa) bridges necessary to tunnel the network traffic generated by the anchors (UDP) inside SSH (TCP) and then back to UDP for the server processing. Finally, all anchors were configured to send all traffic to the internal service exposed by the code instances running on them. A result of the experiment is depicted in Figure 61.

**Figure 61: SSH Tunnel Proof of Concept on Avalue RTLS.**

The PoC was successful: all traffic generated by the anchors to the server was tunneled inside SSH and protected from any MitM attacks while preserving the basic RTLS functionality. However, some challenges need to be addressed. The extra effort produced by the SSH tunneling increased the load on the anchors, leading to a perceived delay in the RTLS server's real-time tag positions. To counteract this effect, the period of synchronization packets was increased from the default 150 ms to 500 ms, reducing the number of communications generated by the anchors but at the expense of reduced position accuracy. This might be a problem for asset owners requiring real-time, precise tag positioning.

Additionally, the possibility of enabling such encryption layers depends entirely on the accessibility of the RTLS server and anchors from the vendor. If either the server or the anchors do not allow administrative access (as was the case with the Sewio RTLS, whose anchors do not expose any SSH access), enacting this solution requires extensive firmware modification or is simply not viable.

## 4. Summary and Key Takeaways

### 4.1 Summary

UWB RTLS are becoming increasingly common as businesses and individuals see the benefits of utilizing this technology to increase efficiency, productivity, and location accuracy of people and assets. Although the IEEE 802.15.4z amendment aimed to increase the security of UWB, the design of securing critical protocols was left up to vendors who may or may not know how to implement this type of security at the device level.

After conducting research on two popular UWB RTLS on the market, Nozomi Networks Labs discovered zero-day vulnerabilities that threat actors can exploit to disrupt and manipulate various environments. Our assessment of these protocols in two popular UWB RTLS revealed security flaws that could allow an attacker to gain full access to sensitive data exchanged over-the-air and impact people's safety. In this paper, we provided mitigations that individuals and asset owners can implement to help mitigate these risks.

We believe that this work is important because of the potential impact on people's lives if threat actors were able to exploit the vulnerabilities identified in our research. By releasing this information publicly, we aim to raise awareness about the importance of ensuring the security of networks in critical infrastructure systems such as airports, hospitals, power plants, and manufacturing facilities.

### 4.2 Key Takeaways
- Weak security requirements in critical software can lead to safety issues that cannot be ignored.
- There are attack surfaces out there that no one is looking at, but they have significant consequences if compromised.
- Exploiting secondary communications in UWB RTLS can be challenging, but it is doable.
