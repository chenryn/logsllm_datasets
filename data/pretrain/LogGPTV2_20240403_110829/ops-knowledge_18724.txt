For example, if you are using the ufw firewall, you need to enter the following command: sudo ufw allow 'Apache' 3. Configure virtual hosts If you want to host multiple websites on the Apache server, you need to configure virtual hosts. Create a new virtual host configuration file in the /etc/apache2/sites-available/ directory, for example: sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/mywebsite.com.conf In this file, you can configure the host name, document Root directory and other information. After saving the file, enable the virtual host with the following command: sudo a2ensite mywebsite.com.conf 4. Reload the Apache server configuration After modifying the Apache server configuration, the configuration file needs to be reloaded for the changes to take effect.

The above are the basic steps to configure Apache server on Linux. According to needs, you can also configure SSL certificates, enable PHP support, and so on.
