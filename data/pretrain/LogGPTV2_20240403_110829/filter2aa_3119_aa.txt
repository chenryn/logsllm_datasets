## Introduction to RF-ID

**RF-ID (Radio Frequency Identification)**
- A technology for remote identification, commonly used in:
  - Garage door remotes
  - Access control systems
  - Factory equipment tracking
  - Electronic product codes in supermarkets

**Frequencies**
- RF-ID operates on various frequencies, with the most common being:
  - 6765 - 6795 kHz
  - 40.66 - 40.7 MHz
  - 24 - 24.25 GHz
  - 13553 - 13567 kHz
  - 433.05 - 434.79 MHz
  - 61 - 61.5 GHz
  - 26957 - 27283 kHz
  - 2400 - 2500 MHz
  - 122 - 123 GHz

## Smart-Labels and EPC

**Smart-Labels**
- Special form of RF-ID application
- Look like normal product tags but contain an antenna and microchip
- Store a Serial Number and EEPROM for data storage, including the EPC (Electronic Product Code)
- Operate on the ISM frequency of 13.56 MHz

**EPC Structure**
- **Header (8 Bit)**
- **EPC Manager (24 Bit)**
- **Object Class (24 Bit)**
- **Serial Number (36 Bit)**

**Common Variants**
- ISO 15693: Tag-it ISO, My-d, I-Code SLI, LRI512, TempSense
- ISO 14443 A: Mifare Standard(1,2), Mifare UltraLight(1,2)
- ISO 14443 B: SR176(1,2)
- Tag-it R, I-Code R

**Features**
- No battery; powered by the RF-ID reader field
- Data stored in clear-text on EEPROM
- Memory pages and no read-protection
- Some have special write protection
- Fixed Tag-Serial-Number and flexible user-data
- Support up to 1000 write cycles

## Applications of Smart-Labels

**Supply Chain Optimization**
- Easy integration at production plants
- Tracking of boxes and goods
- Efficient sorting of boxes and packets
- Just-in-time production
- Monitoring maximum temperature for sensitive goods (e.g., medicine, reefer cargo)

**Data Management**
- Information can be stored in a central database or directly on the EEPROM
- Often a combination of both approaches is used

## Smart-Labels in the US

**FDA Guidance**
- 2005: Mass serialization for some packages, cases, and pallets
- 2005: Use of RFID by some manufacturers, large wholesalers, and some chain drug stores and hospitals
- 2006: Use of RFID by most manufacturers, wholesalers, chain drug stores, hospitals, and some small retailers
- 2007: Use of RFID by all manufacturers, wholesalers, chain drug stores, hospitals, and most small retailers

**Florida**
- July 2003: Pedigree for Top 30 drugs
- July 2006: Pedigree for all drugs

**Walmart**
- June 2004: All Class 2 drugs

## Smart-Labels in Europe

**The Gillette Company**
- Up to 35% loss from plant to store shelf
- Massive problem with shoplifting, especially for small, inexpensive products like razor blades
- Most products have RF-ID tags inside

**Metro Future Store**
- Extensive use of RF-ID and other new technologies

**Main Library Vienna**
- Over 344,000 tags on books, DVDs, CD-ROMs, etc.
- Stores ISBN, author, title, and last date of rent

**EU Government**
- Electronic Passport with RF-ID Chip
- Stores ID number and biometric data

## Other Applications

**Clothing Companies**
- Gap Inc. (US)
- Kaufhof (Germany)
- Benetton (Italy)
- Pilot projects with chips woven into fabric

**Point of Sale (POS) Benefits**
- Auto inventory
- Detection of misplaced products
- Alerting clerks to replace expired goods
- Tracking customer behavior
- Auto-checkout for customers
- Quick checkout using credit cards or RF-ID customer cards

---

## Supply Chain Management

1. **Production**: RF-ID Smart label placed on the product
2. **Factory Exit**: Each product registered inside its package; EPC written to ID-Tags
3. **Delivery**: Palettes tracked when reseller orders
4. **Reseller Site**: New goods registered upon arrival; temperature and expiration date checked
5. **Store Entry**: Products registered by the entry gate
6. **In-Store**: RF-ID reader in shelves detects product removal; alerts clerk if out of stock or incorrect return
7. **Checkout**: Register reads RF-ID from shopping bag; fast self-checkout and shoplifting prevention

## Smart White Goods

**Benefits for Customers**
- Intelligent fridge: auto-inventory, management of expiration dates
- Intelligent washing machine: automatic program selection, detecting red socks in white laundry

## Myths and Facts about RF-ID

**Myth**: RF-ID tags are tiny and can be embedded in any product.
**Fact**: Not true; electromagnetic fields have issues with metal and shielding materials, and antennas have a certain size.

**Myth**: RF-ID chips can be read from a huge distance.
**Fact**: Not true; maximum reading distance within a large gate is about 10 meters.

## Public Information

**Reading RF-ID Tags**
- Requires:
  - RF-ID Reader (e.g., Multi-Tag Reader from ACG Germany)
  - Antenna or gate to build the field
  - Tags
  - PC or laptop to process the information
