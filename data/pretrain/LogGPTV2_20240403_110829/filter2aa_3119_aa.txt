RF-ID
RF-ID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation) is a mechanism to
get an identiﬁcation remotely from:
your remote-control for your garage
an access control-system for a room
a cage in a factory
an electronic product code attached to a wrapped item
in the supermarket
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 3
Frequencies
RF-ID (Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation) operates globally on
different frequencies, the most common systems are using
the ISM (Industrial Science Medical) Bands:
6765 - 6795 kHz
40,66 - 40,7 MHz
24 - 24,25 GHz
13553 - 13567 kHz
433,05 - 434,79 MHz
61 - 61,5 GHz
26957 - 27283 kHz
2400 - 2500 MHz
122 - 123 GHz

Smart Labels - EPC
Smart-Labels are a special form of an RF-ID application. The tags look like normal product
tags, but inside is an antenna and a small microchip. The tags have a Serial Number and an
EEPROM that can store information like the EPC (Electronic Product Code), an international
unique code from the manufacturer. Now the labels have mobile communication capabilities.

Smart-Label - Features
What the Tags have in common:
have no battery, and consume the power to operate
from the RF-ID reader-ﬁeld
store the information in clear-text on the EEPROM
have memory pages
do not have read-protection
some have special write protection
Tag-Serial-Number is ﬁxed, user-data is ﬂexible
support up to 1000 write cycles
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 7
Smart-Labels
The Labels are used by manufacturers and delivery
companies to optimize their supply chain:
easy integration at the production plant
tracking of boxes and goods
easy sorting of boxes and packets
just-in-time production
tracking of the max. temperature for sensitive good
(medicine, reefer cargo)
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 8
Data-Center vs Tag
The information about a product can be stored in an
central database, and only the native serial number of a
Tag is used, or all information can stored on the
EEPROM directly in the labels.
In the ﬁeld we often ﬁnd a combination of both
approaches where some information is stored in the
label, and some is held in a central database.

Smart-Labels in Europe
The Gilette Company
up to 35% loss of their products from the plant to the
shelf in the store
massive problem with shoplifting, small and
in-expensive products like razor blades
most products with RF-ID Tag inside of the product.
Metro Future Store
extensive use of RF-ID and other new technologies
more later ..
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 12
Smart-Labels in Europe
Main Library Vienna
Use of more then 344000 Tags on books, DVDs,
CD-ROMs etc ...
Stores directly on the label:
ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
Author
Title
Last date of rent
The EU Government
Electronic Passport with RF-ID Chip
Chip stores your ID-Number and Biometric Data
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 13
Not only in Food
Some Cloth Companies also use RF-ID Tags
Gap Inc. in the US
Kaufhof in Germany
Benetton from Italy
There are also Tags and pilot project where chips are
woven directly into the fabric.
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 14
POS Beneﬁts
Beneﬁts of Smart-Labels at the Point of Sale:
auto inventory
detect misplaced product at the shelf
alerting the clerk to replace expired goods
track the behavior of the customer in the shop
auto-checkout for the customer, only put the goods in
your shopping bag
the register is an RF-ID Gate, you only need to use your
credit-card or have your RF-ID customer card with you
to make a quick check out
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 15

Myths and Facts about RF-ID
Myth:
RF-ID´s have the size of a pin and can be embedded into
every product.
Fact:
This is not true, the electro-magnetic ﬁelds have problems
with metal and other shielding material. You also need an
antenna to connect the RF-ID Chip to the ﬁeld, the antenna
has some size.
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 24
Myths and Facts about RFID
Myth:
RF-ID Chips can be read from a huge distance.
Fact:
This is not true, you must be in a ﬁeld to power the Chip via
the antenna, the maximum distance within a huge gate are
10 meters.
RF-ID and Smart-Labels: Myth, Technology and Attacks – p. 25
Public Information
RF-ID Tags can be read by everyone! You need:
RF-ID Reader, we use the Multi-Tag Reader from ACG
Germany
an antenna or a gate to build the ﬁeld
Tags
A PC oder Laptop to process the information from the
reader
