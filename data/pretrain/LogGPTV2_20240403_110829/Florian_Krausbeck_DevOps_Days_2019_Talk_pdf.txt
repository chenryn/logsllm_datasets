What are the Requirements of an “Artificial Operational Intelligence Team Member”?●	it takes away “annoying” and time consuming 	tasks from people and prevents us from human 	errors in repetitive work 
●	is part of and also extends existing workflows 	and infrastructure of QAT
●	can work on different environments for 
	developers, QA-engineers and managers at the 	same time
●	is continuously learning
