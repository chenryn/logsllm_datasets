User: I fired up a new Windows google compute engine instance.  It's running Windows 2008 R2, service pack 1.
I download and try running the Python .msi installer for version 2.7.9, and it fails with this error:

There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.  A program required for this install to complete could not be run.  Contact your support personnel or package vendor.

I see this error for both the 64-bit and the 32-bit installer.
Has anyone else seen it or know of a work-around?
Assistant: It seems to be a dependency issue, please try to install "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64)"
