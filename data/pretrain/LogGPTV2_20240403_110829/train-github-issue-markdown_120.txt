 **TypeScript Version:**  
1.8.4
**Visual Studio Version:**  
Community 2015 CTP 14.0.25008.00
Everything was working fine using TypeScript 1.8.1 beta. After installing
1.8.4 last night, the editor no longer works. Typing does nothing. The onlys
keys it responds to are enter, delete, backspace. The three drop-down lists at
the top of the editor that let you jump to certain parts of your code are all
blank.
I've tried all of the following with no luck.
  * Repair/uninstall Visual Studio and TypeScript
  * Disable extensions
  * Uninstall ReSharper
  * Clear MEF component cache
  * Update devenv.exe.config
I also can't seem to stop Visual Studio from updating to the CTP when I
reinstall. I started getting a lot of JavaScript language service crashes
after installing the CTP. Viewing a compiled TS file would cause JavaScript to
stop working.
