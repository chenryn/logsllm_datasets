User: I wanto call a PHP script using Google App Engine. I just want to execute the script. The script updates a couple of databases on my webhost. But I guess Google App waits for the response. Is there a way by which I can start the script.
The script takes some time and Google App might die during that time.
Assistant: Why not rewrite what your php script does in python?
Php is a awful scripting language, and considering your thinking about calling it from inside a very powerful language, why not do it all in python
