User: How to set the time synchronization of a Linux server to ensure that the time of the server is accurate?
Assistant: To set time synchronization on a Linux server, you can use the NTP (Network Time Protocol) service. The following are the setting steps: 1. Determine whether the current server time is correct: Run the command date to check whether the displayed time is accurate. 2. Install NTP service: Use the command to install ntp service: sudo apt-get update #Update source sudo apt-get install ntp #Install ntp service 3. Configure NTP service: Use the command vim /etc/ntp.conf to open the NTP configuration file, Edit the ntp.conf file: # pool.ntp.org maps to more than 300 low-stratum NTP servers. # Your server will pick a different set every time it starts up. # Please consider joining the pool: <http://www .pool.ntp.org/join.html> server pool.ntp.org iburst # By default, exchange time with everybody, but don't allow configuration. restrict -4 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery restrict -6 default kod notrap nomodify nopeer noquery # Local users may interrogate the ntp server more closely. restrict 127.0.0.1 restrict ::1 # Needed for adding pool entries restrict source notrap nomodify noquery The server address behind the server can be changed according to the specific situation. The above configuration file uses a NTP server address: server pool.ntp.org iburst 4. Start the NTP service: Use the command to start the ntp service: sudo systemctl start ntp 5. Set the NTP service to start automatically: Use the command to set the ntp service to start automatically: sudo systemctl enable ntp 6 .Verify whether the time synchronization is successful: Run the command date to check whether the current time has been synchronized to the network standard time. If the time synchronization is successful, the configuration is complete. The ntp service automatically queries once every hour by default. If the ntp configuration is correct, even if the time is modified through the date command, it will be automatically synchronized back by ntp. Note: If NTP synchronization fails, you can run the command ntpdate to manually synchronize time. The format of the command is as follows: sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org This command will force the system time to be synchronized to the time of pool.ntp.org, and change the current time of the system. If it displays ntpdate: adjust time server xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx offset 0.0xxxxx sec, it means the synchronization is successful.
