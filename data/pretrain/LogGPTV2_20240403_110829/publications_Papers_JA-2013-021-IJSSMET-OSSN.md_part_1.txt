ABSTRACT
This article provides the foundations for the new field of research coined Service Networks research.
Understanding what factors explain the structure and dynamics of global service networks may lead to a
more efficient and balanced society and economy. The concept of service network is formally represented as
a business structure made up of services systems which are nodes connected by one or more specific types of
relationships. They can be used to represent the global economy, i.e. a complex network composed of national
economies, which are themselves networks of markets, and markets are also networks of providers, brokers,
intermediaries, and consumers. The authors’ key challenge consists in developing a novel perspective on
socio-economic dynamics by connecting service models representing service systems (e.g. consulting, gov-
ernmental, and educational services). Theories to be developed will enable to understand, describe, explain,
analyze, predict, and control the evolution of global service networks..
