**ABSTRACT**

This article lays the groundwork for a new field of research: Service Networks. Understanding the factors that shape the structure and dynamics of global service networks can lead to a more efficient and balanced society and economy. A service network is defined as a business structure composed of interconnected service systems, which can represent the global economy, national economies, markets, and interactions among providers, brokers, intermediaries, and consumers. The key challenge is to develop a novel perspective on socio-economic dynamics by connecting service models (e.g., consulting, governmental, and educational services). Theories developed will enable us to understand, describe, explain, analyze, predict, and control the evolution of global service networks.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Many systems around us can be described using network models, such as social networks, the Internet, and power grids. Understanding how services evolve as networks and the risks and benefits of different topologies is increasingly critical for society (Spohrer & Maglio, 2010). This impact can be compared to contributions in the areas of social networks and the Web. If we consider every individual on the planet as a potential owner of resources relevant to at least one real-world service, we would have seven billion service systems. Therefore, information systems must be in place to enable each individual to play an active role in service-centric societies.

The ability to construct service networks is essential for understanding the dynamics of global service-based economies and their innovation. However, current techniques fall short of providing effective solutions because they cannot handle the automated description of open and rich relationships between services. In this article, we focus on the challenging task of constructing open semantic service networks (OSSNs) by accessing, retrieving, and combining information from globally distributed service systems and relationship models. Service systems, relationships, and service networks are considered open when their models are transparently available and accessible by external entities, following an open-world assumption. Networks are deemed semantic if service systems and relationship models share a common understanding of vocabularies, rules, and semantic web theories and technologies.

Current developments aim to create computer-understandable descriptions of services using comprehensive languages like the Unified Service Description Language (*-USDL) (Cardoso et al., 2010). These languages will allow the formalization of service system descriptions, enabling dynamic service outsourcing, efficient SaaS trading, and automatic service contract negotiation. For simplicity, we will use the term "service" to refer to a service system.

### 2. MOTIVATION

A service network can be defined as a business structure where nodes represent service systems connected by specific types of relationships. Figure 1 illustrates the main elements of service networks and their environment. Relationships, often provided by commercial companies and governmental agencies, represent the transfer of goods, revenue, knowledge, social ties, market positions, and intangible benefits (Håkansson & Ford, 2002).

Consider the networked economy through the lens of financial service networks. Today's financial networks are highly interrelated and interdependent. Disruptions in one service can have cascading effects on others. For example, the 2008 economic crisis started in the U.S. and caused problems in European markets, nearly bankrupting Iceland. Leading financial services closed (e.g., Lehman Brothers investment bank), others merged, and new services emerged. The configuration and topology of financial service networks changed as a reaction mechanism. The disaster was a surprise, but local information was available and could have been used to anticipate the catastrophe. Unfortunately, this information was not accessible to regulators.

Now, imagine if governments had the technology and legal power to force institutions to describe all their financial services using machine-understandable standard description models (e.g., *-USDL). All services and their descriptions would be remotely accessible to regulatory bodies. If Bank A provides loaning or consulting services to Bank B, this information would also be described and accessible to regulators. In such a scenario, regulators could access and retrieve service and relationship models to reconstruct financial service networks, identify vulnerable services, and protect the network's functionality. Conflicts of interest, suspicious relationships, unlawful practices, and patterns indicating monopolies or oligopolies could be identified, triggering legal investigations and reparative actions if necessary.

### 3. OVERVIEW AND LITERATURE REVIEW

The study of services has been approached from various perspectives, with some strands more mature than others. This section provides a brief overview of the main contributions relevant to the study of service networks. Razo-Zapata et al. (2012) provide a more comprehensive survey and suggest how the two major trends—value orientation and process orientation—can converge.

#### 3.1. Technical Perspective

From a technical perspective, significant work has been done on the description of software-based services, service-based architectures, and service composition into higher-level business processes (Erl, 2005). Web service interfaces have long been described using WSDL (or WADL for REST), allowing systems to perform invocations and expect results. Later efforts added semantics to these descriptions, leading to initiatives like SAWSDL, OWL-S, and WSMO (Pedrinaci et al., 2010). GoodRelations (Hepp, 2011) introduced a vocabulary to describe products and services, making it easier for customers to search and compare them. Standards for registries, such as UDDI, have also emerged, complemented by semantic extensions that enable searching services by business goals.

#### 3.2. Business Models

Researchers have worked on formalizing business models. For example, Weiner and Weisbecker (2011) describe models addressing value networks, market interfaces, products and services, and financial aspects. Osterwalder et al. (2010) presented the Business Model Canvas, a simple conceptual model for sketching business models. However, most business modeling approaches fail to adhere to service-dominant logic and focus too much on internal company operations rather than the broader network. Efforts have been made to account for cross-company collaboration in complex value networks. Contributions aimed at conceptual modeling of business networks, often described in natural language, include works by Weill and Vitale (2001), Chesbrough and Rosenbloom (2002), and Tapscott et al. (2000). The STOF Framework (Bouwman et al., 2008) addresses business and technical issues in an integrated manner, but it is still aimed at circumscribed business model design.

### 4. SEVEN PRINCIPLES FOR COMMUNITY-BASED DESIGN OF OSSN

To bring the proposed scenario to life, we suggest seven principles for the community-based design of OSSNs:

1. **Identification of a Suitable Schema, Language, or Ontology:** Develop a common framework to model services.
2. **Creation of an Open and Rich Model:** Represent relationships between service models.
3. **Population of Service and Relationship Models:** Populate the models with detailed information.
4. **Development of an Infrastructure:** Enable querying and accessing distributed service models and dynamically construct global service networks.

These principles aim to maximize the usage of available service information and facilitate the location of related services in online marketplaces. Our solution involves four research activities: identifying a suitable schema, creating a rich model for relationships, populating the models, and developing an infrastructure for querying and accessing distributed service models.

### 5. ILLUSTRATING THE VALUE OF OSSN

Section 6 illustrates the value of OSSNs in the context of several research projects, demonstrating their practical applications and benefits.

### 6. CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this article provides the foundations for the new field of Service Networks research. By understanding and leveraging the structure and dynamics of global service networks, we can achieve a more efficient and balanced society and economy. Future work will focus on developing and implementing the proposed principles to realize the full potential of OSSNs.
