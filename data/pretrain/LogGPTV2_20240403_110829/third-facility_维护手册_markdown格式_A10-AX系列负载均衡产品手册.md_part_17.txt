**Default:**
10

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

---

#### `merge-mode-add`

**Description:**
Enters "merge" mode and integrates new configurations into the current running configuration. This is a setting of the "block-merge" command in which any child instances of the old configuration are retained if not present in the new configuration.

#### `mirror-port`

**Description:**
Specifies a port to receive copies of another port’s traffic. For more information about mirror port configuration, see “Multiple Port-Monitoring Mirror Ports” in the System Configuration and Administration Guide.

**Syntax:**
```
[no] mirror-port portnum ethernet portnum [input | output | both]
```

**Parameters:**
- **portnum:** Mirror port index number.
- **ethernet portnum:** Ethernet port number. This is the port that will act as the mirror port.
- **input:** Configures the mirror port so that only inbound traffic from the monitored port can be sent out of the mirror port.
- **output:** Configures the mirror port so that only outbound traffic from the monitored port can be sent out of the mirror port.
- **both:** Configures the mirror port so that both inbound and outbound traffic from the monitored port can be sent out of the mirror port. This is the default behavior.

**Default:**
Not set

**Mode:**
Configuration mode

**Usage:**
When enabling monitoring on a port, you can specify the mirror port to use. You also can specify the traffic direction. A monitored port can use multiple mirror ports. To specify the port to monitor, use the `monitor` command at the interface configuration level. (See the “monitor” command in the Network Configuration Guide.)

**Examples:**
```
ACOS(config)#mirror-port 1 ethernet 4 both
ACOS(config)#interface ethernet 8
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:8)#monitor 1 both

ACOS(config)#mirror-port 2 ethernet 3 input
ACOS(config)#interface ethernet 6
ACOS(config-if:ethernet:6)#monitor 2 input
```

#### `monitor`

**Description:**
Specifies event thresholds for utilization of resources.

**Syntax:**
```
[no] monitor resource-type threshold-value
```

**Parameters:**
- **resource-type:**
  - **buffer-drop:** Packet drops (dropped IO buffers)
  - **buffer-usage:** Control buffer utilization
  - **conn-type0-4:** Configures the conn resource type thresholds per CPU (32, 64, 128, 256, 512 bytes)
  - **ctrl-cpu:** Control CPU utilization
  - **data-cpu:** Data CPUs utilization
  - **disk:** Hard disk utilization
  - **memory:** Memory utilization
  - **smp-type0-4:** Threshold for SMP resources for the global session memory pool (32, 64, 128, 256, 512 bytes)
  - **warn-temp:** CPU temperature
- **threshold-value:** The values you can specify depend on the event type and on the ACOS device model. For information, see the CLI help.

**Default:**
The default threshold values depend on the event type and on the ACOS model. For information, see the CLI help.

**Usage:**
If utilization of a system resource crosses the configured threshold, a log message is generated. If applicable, an SNMP trap is also generated. To display the configured event thresholds, see “show monitor” on page 323.

**Example:**
```
ACOS(config)#monitor data-cpu 80
```

#### `multi-config`

**Description:**
Enables simultaneous admin sessions.

**Syntax:**
```
[no] multi-config enable
```

**Default:**
Enabled

**Mode:**
Config

**Usage:**
Use the “no” form of the command to disable multiple admin access. Disabling multiple admin access does not terminate currently active admin sessions. For example, if there are 4 active config sessions, disabling multi-user access will cause the display of a permission prompt when a 5th user attempts to log onto the device. However, the previous 4 admin sessions will continue to run unaffected.

---

#### `multi-ctrl-cpu`

**Description:**
Enables use of more than one CPU for control processing.

**Syntax:**
```
multi-ctrl-cpu num
```

**Parameters:**
- **num:** The number of CPUs to use for control processing. Up to one-fourth of the device’s CPUs can be used for control processing.

**Default:**
One CPU is used for control processing.

**Mode:**
Global configuration level

**Usage:**
A reboot is required to place this command into effect. This command is required if you plan to enable use of multiple CPUs for health-check processing. There is no “no” form of this command. To disable multiple CPUs for control processing and restore it back to default, simply configure `multi-ctrl-cpu 1`.

**Example:**
```
ACOS(config)# show hardware

#### `netflow common max-packet-queue-time`

**Description:**
Specifies the maximum amount of time ACOS can hold onto a NetFlow record packet in the queue before sending it to the NetFlow collector. ACOS holds a NetFlow packet in the queue until the packet payload is full of record data or until the queue timer expires.

**Syntax:**
```
[no] netflow common max-packet-queue-time queue-time-multiplier
```

**Parameters:**
- **queue-time-multiplier:** The multiplier for the maximum queue time. Multiply this value by 20 to calculate the maximum number of milliseconds (ms) ACOS will hold a NetFlow packet in the queue before sending it. The multiplier can be 0-50. Setting the multiplier to 0 means that there will be no delay for NetFlow packets to be sent to the NetFlow collector, and NetFlow records will not be buffered.

**Default:**
50 (1-second maximum queue time)

**Mode:**
Global configuration level

---

#### `netflow monitor`

**Description:**
Enables ACOS to act as a NetFlow exporter, for monitoring traffic and exporting the data to one or more NetFlow collectors for analysis.

**Syntax:**
```
[no] netflow monitor monitor-name
```

**Default:**
Replace `monitor-name` with the name of the NetFlow monitor. This command changes the CLI to the configuration level for the specified NetFlow monitor, where the following commands are available.

**Commands:**
- **[no] destination ipaddr [portnum]:** Configures the destination where NetFlow records will be sent.
- **disable:** Disables this NetFlow monitor.
- **[no] flow-timeout minutes:** Timeout value interval at which flow records will be periodically exported for long-lived sessions. Flow records for short-lived sessions (if any) are sent upon termination of the session. The flow timeout can be set to 0-1440 minutes. The flow timeout default value is 10 minutes. Setting the timeout value to 0 disables the flow timeout feature.
- **[no] protocol {v9 | v10}:** Configures the version of the NetFlow protocol you want to use. Default is v9.
- **[no] record netflow-template-type:** Configures the NetFlow record types to be exported. (See the “NetFlow v9 and v10 (IPFIX)” chapter in the System Configuration and Administration Guide.)
- **[no] resend-template {records num | timeout seconds}:** Configures when to resend the NetFlow template. The trigger can be either the number of records or the amount of time that has passed.
  - **records num:** Specifies the counters by which the ACOS device resends templates to the collectors. The `num` can be 0-1000000. The default is 1000.
  - **timeout seconds:** Specifies the time between when templates are resent to the collectors. The `num` is the number of seconds and can be 0-86400. The default is 1800. Specifying 0 means never resend the template.
- **[no] sample {ethernet portnum | global | nat-pool pool-name | ve ve-num}:** Enables sampling. Configure filters for monitoring traffic. Identify the specific type and subset of resources to monitor.
  - **ethernet portnum:** Specify the list of Ethernet data ports to monitor. Flow information for the monitored interfaces is sent to the NetFlow collector(s).
  - **global:** (Default) No filters are in effect. Traffic on all interfaces is monitored.
  - **nat-pool pool-name:** NAT pool.
  - **ve ve-num:** Specify the list of Virtual Ethernet (VE) data ports to monitor.
- **[no] source-address {ip ipv4addr | ipv6 ipv6addr}:** Uses the specified IP address as the source address for exported NetFlow packets. By default, the IP address assigned to the egress interface is used. This command does not change the egress port out which the NetFlow traffic is exported.
- **[no] source-ip-use-mgmt:** Use the management interface’s IP address as the source IP for exported NetFlow packets. This command does not change the egress port out which the NetFlow traffic is exported.

**Default:**
Described above, where applicable.
