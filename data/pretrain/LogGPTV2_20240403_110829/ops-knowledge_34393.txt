Assistant: A SAS interface can accomodate either SAS or SATA drives; you can connect up to 4 SATA drives on one mini-SAS port (with a fanout cable).

You'll have to examine the BIOS POST message(s) in more detail - or consult the controller BIOS and event log - to find out what exactly it is saying.
