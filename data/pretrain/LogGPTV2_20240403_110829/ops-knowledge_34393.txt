Subject: Dell PowerEdge 1950 Server SAS Drive Error with SATA Drives

Dear Support,

I am experiencing an issue with my Dell PowerEdge 1950 server. The system is reporting a SAS drive error, even though I am only using SATA drives. When the error occurs, the system prompts me to press F1 to continue.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?

Thank you for your assistance.

Hello,

Thank you for reaching out. The SAS interface in your Dell PowerEdge 1950 server can accommodate both SAS and SATA drives. You can connect up to four SATA drives to a single mini-SAS port using a fanout cable.

To troubleshoot the SAS drive error, please follow these steps:

1. **Examine the BIOS POST Messages:**
   - Restart the server and carefully observe the messages displayed during the Power-On Self-Test (POST).
   - Note any specific error codes or messages related to the SAS drive.

2. **Check the Controller BIOS:**
   - Enter the controller BIOS by pressing the appropriate key (usually Ctrl+R or Ctrl+C) during the POST.
   - Review the settings and ensure that the controller is configured correctly for SATA drives.

3. **Review Event Logs:**
   - Access the system's event logs to find more detailed information about the error.
   - Look for any recent entries that may provide additional context or clues.

4. **Update Firmware:**
   - Ensure that the firmware for the SAS/SATA controller and the system BIOS are up to date.
   - Visit the Dell support website to download and install the latest firmware updates.

If the issue persists after following these steps, please provide the specific error message and any relevant log entries for further assistance.

Best regards,
