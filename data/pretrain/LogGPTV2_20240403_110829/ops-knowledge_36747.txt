User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to include ModSecurity request final action in the Apache access.log I'm currently using ModSecurity 2.7 and Apache 2.4.7 on Ubuntu Trusty.

I would like to use Apache's LogFormat and CustomLog directives so that I can include a field indicating whether ModSecurity decided to allow a request to proceed or whether it blocked a request.

I would also like to include a field indicating whether an allowed request did trigger any warning-only ModSecurity rules. I am not concerned whether this needs to be two different fields, or just one, as long as the information is present on each Apache log line.

There is documentation that suggests I can use mod_log_config and %{...}M syntax to include ModSecurity variables in the Apache log but I do not know which variables would give me the necessary information.

I am explicitly trying to maintain SecAuditEngine RelevantOnly and not require a full audit log for every request. I am also hoping to avoid the need to do cross-log correlation using mod_unique_id or similar.

Is this possible. How?

Assistant: Try blocking with an unusual response status, then logging that in the log. For warnings, use HIGHEST_SEVERITY.
