User: How to setup Nginx reverse proxy? Please detail the steps and the relevant configuration files.
Assistant: The steps to set up the Nginx reverse proxy are as follows: Step 1: Install Nginx On the Linux system, we can use the package manager to install Nginx. On Ubuntu or Debian systems, you can use the following commands to install Nginx: sudo apt update sudo apt install nginx If you are using CentOS or Red Hat systems, you can use the following commands to install Nginx: sudo yum install epel-release sudo yum install nginx Step 2: Configure Nginx reverse proxy Next, we need to configure Nginx reverse proxy. Open the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, add the following code to the http block: http { server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } } In the above configuration file, Nginx is specified to listen on port 80 and forward the request to port 8080 of the machine. Among them, proxy_set_header is used to set HTTP request header information. Step 3: Test the Nginx reverse proxy After completing the above configuration, we need to test whether the Nginx reverse proxy is effective. We can install a web server locally and use Nginx reverse proxy to access it. Take the Apache server as an example, you can use the following command to install: sudo apt update sudo apt install apache2 After the installation is complete, start the Apache server: sudo systemctl start apache2 Then, visit http://localhost in the browser, if everything is normal, you should be able to See the Apache server default welcome page. Finally, use a browser on another machine to visit http://example.com. If the Nginx reverse proxy works, you should be able to see the welcome page of the Apache server. The above are the steps and related configuration files of the entire Nginx reverse proxy setting.
