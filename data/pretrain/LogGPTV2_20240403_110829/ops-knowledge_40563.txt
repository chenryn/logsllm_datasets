User: Which linux distro is better suited for Python web development?
Background:
I currently develop on Windows and it's fine, but I am looking to move my core Python development to Linux. I'm sure most any distro will work fine, but does anyone have any reasons to believe one distro is better than another?
Assistant: i think i remember a podcast with Guido Van Rossum and his core team python developers back in the days, and one of that core python developer is now employed by Canonical to take care of python integration for the ubuntu distro. So that explains why ubuntu is a much more pythonic distro compared to other distro. 
On the other hand, the gentoo linux distro also has python integrated in its Portage package management system. So gentoo and ubuntu I would say are good for python development system and each represent both ends of the spectrum.
