User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Prove log files weren't tampered with? Say I have some Apache logs that show brute force attempts on a login page. I've singled out the IP, and found out who the culprit was. How can I show to a third party that I didn't makeup the entries in those logs?

Is there a way to systematically prove through some means of hashing, or system verification that the logs aren't edited in any way?

The scenario I gave above is purely hypothetical. But was wondering if you could verify logs like that somehow.

Assistant: No, you cannot prove to someone else, that logs on your system have not been tampered with. Clearly, if you own that given system, you can do whatever you like with it, including the manipulation of all files. 

In the end it's a question of trust. Therefore that third party would have to define, what they would require to trust your data. 
A possible solution for them could be to deploy a third party system between your server and the internet, so that they can observe the network traffic themselves.

There are however tools, that regularly check file integrity, but those usually aim for more or less static file contents like config files and are probably not applicable for log files. Still, if they would do the job, they would still run on your system and do not change the scope of trust, the third party would have to accept.
