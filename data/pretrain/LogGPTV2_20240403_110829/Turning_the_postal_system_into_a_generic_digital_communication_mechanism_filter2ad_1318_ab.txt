#### Overview
The HLHB (High Latency, High Bandwidth) Postmanet and the LLLB (Low Latency, Low Bandwidth) Internet can be used in tandem to handle various types of data transmission. This document explores several use cases and the necessary infrastructure to support these applications.

#### Web Pointing to or Embedded with Large Data Objects
Large data objects, such as audio, video, programs, and models, can be embedded or linked in web content. To manage the decoupled arrival of these large files, a Postmanet-aware client-side proxy can be employed. Small data items, like top-level HTML pages, are retrieved over the LLLB Internet to ensure their freshness. Large data objects are transferred over the HLHB Postmanet and cached on the client side. The client-side proxy periodically polls the LLLB Internet to check the freshness of the cached data.

There are two scenarios for the server side:
1. **Postmanet-Aware Content Publisher**: Responds to client "subscription" requests by sending large data items over the Postmanet.
2. **Non-Postmanet-Aware Content Publisher**: A well-connected third party retrieves large data items from the original publisher over a conventional network and repackages them for delivery over the Postmanet.

#### Remote File System Mirroring for Sharing and/or Backup
Large amounts of newly written file data can be transmitted to a remote mirror site over the HLHB Postmanet. Users at the remote mirror site can use the LLLB Internet to check the freshness of the mirrored files.

#### Peer-to-Peer File Sharing
Large media files are ideal for transmission over the HLHB Postmanet. Small messages, such as foreground file searches or background announcements, are sent over the LLLB Internet. The Postmanet is orthogonal to the choice of the overall file sharing system architecture, which can be centralized or decentralized. Digital Rights Management (DRM) techniques can be incorporated to address copyright concerns.

#### Video "Almost On-Demand"
Existing online DVD rental services suffer from multi-day latency between request submission and delivery. An alternative model involves proactively pushing encrypted movies to customers, including recommendations based on rental history, popular movies, and new releases. With high-capacity storage, customers can store hundreds or thousands of movies locally. To view a movie, a customer purchases a decryption key over the LLLB Internet, gaining instant access to the locally stored and encrypted content. DRM technologies can prevent unauthorized dissemination.

#### Publish/Subscribe Systems for Other Types of Content
The video "almost on-demand" model can be extended to other types of content, such as music, TV and radio programs, newspapers, magazines, store catalogs, software releases, and public lectures. The Postmanet's high bandwidth and low cost make it an attractive solution for disseminating a wide range of content.

#### Distance Learning
Multimedia teaching materials can be distributed to students over the HLHB Postmanet. Students can submit homework for grading via the Postmanet, and teacher feedback can be returned the same way. Small changes to existing lessons can be delivered over the LLLB Internet. Real-time interactions, such as voice communication, can be supported through phone or the Internet. For effective interaction, teachers need context pointers to the content being played off local disks. These pointers are transmitted in real time along with student questions.

#### Simultaneous Use of HLHB Postmanet and LLLB Internet
The HLHB Postmanet can support target applications even with limited, intermittent, or poor-quality LLLB Internet access. In rural regions, Postmanet routers can be shared resources in neighborhood shops, co-located with public telephones. Users can pick up and drop off Postmanet disks and use telephony equipment to transmit control messages. Even in areas without LLLB Internet, the Postmanet can be used for tasks like receiving large digital catalogs, placing orders offline, and sending back orders via the Postmanet.

#### End-Point Support for Transparency
Manual preparation of data for shipment on movable storage media is complex. The postal system, like a datagram service, can experience issues such as damage, loss, delay, or out-of-order delivery. To address these, sophisticated support is needed at both systems and application levels. This includes simultaneous exploitation of the Internet and excess capacity of movable storage media to improve latency, cost, and reliability.

#### Simultaneous Exploitation of the Internet
With the aid of an LLLB connection, the Postmanet becomes more powerful. The Internet can be viewed as a cache for the Postmanet, providing faster, smaller, and sometimes more expensive alternatives. Acknowledgments and retransmission decisions can be made based on factors like data size and desired arrival time. Multiple versions of data (e.g., low and high resolution) can be sent over the LLLB Internet and HLHB Postmanet, respectively, allowing for trade-offs in quality, latency, and availability.

#### Liberal Exploitation of Excess Capacity
Data can be proactively replicated across multiple mobile storage devices to mitigate delays or losses. Continuous background copying can occur throughout the day, and obsolete data can be excluded from later transmissions. This approach optimizes for lower latency and better reliability by "wasting" plentiful storage capacity.

#### Handling Datagram Limitations
The limitations of postal system datagram delivery are exacerbated by aggressive use of the Internet and excess capacity. The receiver must discard duplicates and handle out-of-order delivery. Application-specific intelligence combined with Postmanet transport algorithms can minimize unnecessary data copies. These challenges are similar to those in traditional networks but are further complicated by the large data sizes and latencies involved in the Postmanet.

In summary, the HLHB Postmanet and LLLB Internet can be effectively used together to handle a variety of data transmission needs, with the necessary infrastructure and support to ensure reliability and efficiency.
