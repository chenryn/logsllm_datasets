body over it, while the large attachments travel over the HLHB
Postmanet. (Certain extra UI features are needed to deal with the
decoupled arrival.)
• Web pointing to or embedded with large data objects. These large
data objects may include audio, video, programs, and models. To
avoid the need of client-side browser modiﬁcation, one can em-
ploy a Postmanet-aware client-side proxy. Small data items, such
as top-level html pages, can be retrieved over the LLLB Internet
(to ensure their freshness). Large data objects that are pulled or
pushed over the HLHB Postmanet can be placed in a client-side
cache. The client-side proxy may poll over the LLLB Internet to
check the freshness of the cached data. There are two possibili-
ties for the server side: the content publisher is either Postmanet-
aware or not. A Postmanet-aware content publisher program may
respond to client “subscription” requests by sending them large
data items over the Postmanet. For a content publisher site that
is not Postmanet-aware, a possible way for its large data items to
reach poorly-connected clients is via a well-connected third party
that is Postmanet-aware: this third party would retrieve large data
items from the original content publisher over a conventional net-
work and repackage them to send to poorly-connected subscribing
clients over the Postmanet.
• Remote ﬁle system mirroring for sharing and/or backup. Large
amounts of newly written ﬁle data can be transmitted to a remote
mirror site over the HLHB Postmanet. Users at this remote mirror
site who desire to read up-to-date versions of the ﬁles may use the
LLLB Internet to check freshness of the mirror.
• Peer-to-peer ﬁle sharing. Large media ﬁles are excellent can-
didates for transmission over the HLHB Postmanet. The small
messages generated by foreground ﬁle searches or background an-
nouncements of sites’ contents can be transmitted over the LLLB
Internet. Note that the use of the Postmanet is orthogonal to the
choice of the overall ﬁle sharing system architecture, which can
be based on either centralized metadata servers or entirely decen-
tralized alternatives. Copy right protection concerns can be ad-
dressed by incorporating Digital Rights Management (DRM) tech-
niques [1] and the Postmanet should be neutral to such concerns,
just as a traditional network is.
• Video “almost on-demand.” A shortcoming of the existing on-
line DVD movie-rental businesses is the multi-day latency elapsed
between the time a request is submitted over the Internet and the
time the desired movie arrives via the postal system. In an alter-
native model, subject to customer permission, the rental company
could proactively push encrypted movies to participating customers
without necessarily having received explicit requests. These may
include recommended movies based on customers’ rental history,
popular movies, and new releases. At the current rate of stor-
age density and price improvement, it would be very reasonable
to assume multi-terabyte hard disks ﬁlled with hundreds or even
thousands of movies being employed by the HLHB Postmanet.
Large encrypted libraries of movies can accumulate on participat-
ing customers’ local storage devices. To view a movie, a customer
would purchase a decryption key on-demand from the rental com-
pany over the LLLB Internet and gain access to a locally stored
and encrypted selection instantaneously. Again, emerging DRM
technologies such as Microsoft’s Palladium [1] should be able to
prevent unauthorized dissemination of decrypted content or other
usage that is outside a contract. For example, such a DRM contract
may restrict the number of times that a movie can be played for a
certain payment.
• Publish/subscribe systems for other types of content. The above
video “almost on-demand” application can be generalized to dis-
seminate many other types of content in a generic publish/subscribe
system. The types of content may include music, TV and radio pro-
grams, newspapers, magazines and store catalogs (with richer pre-
sentation), software releases and updates, and public lectures given
at universities. The possibilities enabled by an inexpensive com-
munication channel with practically inﬁnite bandwidth can be vast.
While it is possible to develop and maintain individual solutions for
different types of content, the presence of a generic Postmanet in-
frastructure that is available to all applications makes the approach
more attractive.
• Distance learning. In addition to multimedia teaching material
that is being disseminated by teacher sites to students over the
HLHB Postmanet, the students may submit content such as digi-
tized homework for grading over the Postmanet, and the resulting
teacher feedback may be sent back over the Postmanet again [24,
15]. Small changes to an existing lesson, which has been taught
before and the corresponding course material is already stored on
a local disk, could be delivered over the LLLB channel. Some of
the interactions that have relatively low bandwidth demands could
be supported in real time. For example, voice carried by phone or
the Internet may allow pupils to interact with their remote teacher
in real time. For a teacher to interact with the pupils effectively,
the teacher should know the context in terms of what the pupils are
currently learning. If a pupil asks a speciﬁc question about a sub-
ject matter in the middle of the content stream that is being played
off a local disk, the teacher needs to “see” that part of the content.
In a traditional distance learning system, this interaction is accom-
plished through two-way video conferencing. With a Postmanet,
since both the teacher and the students have access to the same
data stored on their respective local disks, all the teacher needs are
“pointers” into the content stream; these pointers are transmitted
from the pupils along with their questions in real time. In addition
to providing voice feedback, the teacher can also send back com-
puter commands over the Internet to control the “playback” of the
lesson at the students’ site.
In the above discussion of example applications, we have seen
how we can exploit the simultaneous use of the HLHB Postmanet
and the LLLB Internet. The HLHB Postmanet can support our
target applications even when the access to the LLLB Internet is
limited, intermittent, or of poor quality. In rural regions of devel-
oping nations like India, the Postmanet router could be a shared
resource that is deployed in neighborhood shops, co-located with
public telephones.2 Users would go to these shops to pick up and
2At the end of 2002, more than 84% of Indian villages had access to public
telephone facilities [5]. For some remote areas, the services are provided
using non-wired technologies such as Wireless in Local Loop and satellite
telephones. Recently, the Indian government has started a pilot program
wherein some postmen would carry mobile phones and make them available
to people at their doorsteps, representing a true convergence of the postal
and telecom services in the country.
drop off Postmanet disks and use the telephony equipment to trans-
mit Postmanet control messages.
The HLHB Postmanet could be utilized even when the LLLB
Internet is non-existent. For example, a user may receive a large
digital catalog of Amazon.com via the Postmanet, browse the cat-
alog and place purchase orders “off-line,” and send back the orders
via the Postmanet (instead of via an Internet connection, had it been
available). This arrangement is especially useful for places such as
isolated remote regions in developing countries where even dialup
connections are not always available.
Although we have called the Postmanet a “high latency” chan-
nel, we note that by exploiting the plentiful storage capacity and
bandwidth of the Postmanet, it can be possible to mask its high
latency. The video “almost on-demand” example is particularly
illustrative: by liberally disseminating content that may never be
actually used by users who receive it, a publisher who uses the
HLHB channel can, perhaps ironically, create the illusion of in-
stantaneous on-demand access for content that is used. This theme
of deliberately “wasting” plentiful resources to optimize for scarce
resources will be revisited in other aspects of the functioning of the
Postmanet.
3. END POINT SUPPORT FOR
TRANSPARENCY
At ﬁrst glance, manual preparation of data for shipment on mov-
able storage media may appear deceptively simple. But manu-
ally copying, naming and managing many messages, potentially
for numerous applications and communicating peers, is cumber-
some. The postal system represents a classic analogy of a data-
gram service: individual movable storage media may be damaged,
lost, delayed, or delivered out of order. Human users or individ-
ual applications should not have to cope with these complications
if they desire better guarantees and abstractions. What makes these
issues even more complex is our desire to simultaneously exploit
the Internet and to exploit the excess capacity of movable storage
media to improve the latency, cost and reliability of the system.
To cope with these complications, and to fully realize the potential
of this approach, we need support at both systems and application
levels. The type of sophistication we demand from this support is
far greater than that can be provided by a local ﬁle system, which,
for example, does not address any of the above transport issues.
The lack of a programming interface makes it difﬁcult for multi-
ple applications to programatically and easily exploit, let alone to
coordinate or share the use of, this communication mechanism.
3.1 Simultaneous Exploitation of the Internet
The Postmanet can be very valuable in absence of any traditional
connectivity. With the aid of an LLLB connection such as a phone
modem, however, the Postmanet becomes even more powerful and
interesting. In the rest of this paper, we assume the simultaneous
availability of such an LLLB link. One way of looking at this prob-
lem is to view the Internet connection as a “cache” of the Post-
manet connection:
the former is a faster (latency-wise), smaller
(bandwidth- and capacity-wise), and sometimes more expensive al-
ternative that provides comparable functionalities. The question is
how to use this scarce resource in an appropriate way.
When data arrives at a Postmanet receiver via the postal system,
for example, the receiver should send an acknowledgement back to
the sender over the Internet. This may further cause the sender to
discard a local message copy that may have been saved for poten-
tial retransmission. More generally, the sender system may choose
between the LLLB Internet and the HLHB Postmanet based on fac-
tors such as the amount of data to be sent and the desired arrival
time. Indeed, the system may choose to use the Internet and Post-
manet channels in parallel. Portions of a large data object may start
to incrementally arrive at the receiver over the Internet, while the
complete object arrives later over the Postmanet. At the applica-
tion level, multiple versions of a data item may be prepared: for
example, a low resolution version is shipped over the LLLB Inter-
net, while a high resolution version is shipped simultaneously via
the HLHB Postmanet. Multiple versions of the data may “race”
against each other as they progress in the two different “networks,”
so we can trade off metrics such as quality, latency and availability.
3.2 Liberal Exploitation of Excess Capacity
In addition to possibly sending redundant data simultaneously
over the Internet and the Postmanet, we may also proactively repli-
cate data in the Postmanet. For example, as multiple mobile storage
devices are sent between a sender-receiver pair on successive days,
we may liberally replicate outgoing data of earlier days on outgoing
devices sent on later days. In cases where a single storage media
is delayed or lost due to accidents in the postal system, the repli-
cated data on subsequently arriving devices is just a day away, so
we can avoid unnecessary long end-to-end retransmission delays.
This is another example of the consistent Postmanet theme of lib-
erally “wasting” plentiful resources (storage capacity) to optimize
for more difﬁcult metrics (lower latency or better reliability).
One possible factor that may constrain the liberal copying of data
onto movable storage media at the sender is available time. If the
mobile storage devices being used can be written to incrementally,
we may not need to wait till shortly before the arrival of the post-
man to begin writing to the device in a long burst—continuous
background copying could have occurred throughout the day. At
the application level, if a later sending event should supersede ear-
lier ones (because, for example, only the freshest version of an up-
dated object needs to be sent), the system would take care of ex-
cluding from the mobile storage device obsolete data that is sent
earlier.
3.3 Handling Datagram Limitations
The limitations of postal system datagram delivery are exacer-
bated by our aggressive exploitation of the Internet and the excess
capacity. At the systems level, for example, due to proactive repli-
cation or premature retransmission by the sender, either across mul-
tiple mobile storage devices, or across the Internet and the postal
system, the receiver may need to discard the duplicates. Multiple
storage media may have been delivered by the postal system out-of-
order; and data delivered by the postal system and by the Internet
may arrive out-of-order. Similar issues may occur at the applica-
tion level also. For example, even in absence of duplicates or out-
of-order delivery, the receiver application may discover that some
of the newly arriving data is no longer needed due to application-
speciﬁc reasons. In all these cases, the system must exercise care
not to unnecessarily copy or use obsolete data. This is especially
relevant due to our general approach of liberally “wasting” storage
capacity in an effort to optimize for other metrics—this “wastage”
needs to be checked by cleverly combining application-speciﬁc in-
telligence with Postmanet’s transport-level algorithms.
Many of the issues described above, such as retransmission, han-
dling out-of-order delivery, suppressing duplicates, and minimizing
data copies, bear a resemblance to those that one must deal with in
traditional communication networks.
In the context of the Post-
manet, however, not only are these problems further complicated
by our aggressive exploitation of the Internet and the excess ca-
pacity, it is also the case that the boundary between storage and
networks is blurred. The latency and the amount of data involved
in a “packet” (i.e., a mobile storage media) can be many orders of
magnitude greater than those of a traditional network packet. This
makes the research problem as much a distributed storage problem
as a networking problem. For example, in some application sce-
narios where data coherence is relevant, the freshest data can be
