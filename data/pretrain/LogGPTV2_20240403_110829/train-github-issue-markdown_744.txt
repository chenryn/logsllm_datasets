Here is a reduced test case: [workercoverage.zip](workercoverage.zip).

To run the test, follow these steps:

1. Execute the test script by running:
   ```sh
   ./runTest.sh
   ```

2. View the results in the `html/index.html` file.

Please ensure that `genhtml` is installed on your system. If you do not have `genhtml` installed, you can still inspect the `lcov.info` file to verify that it only includes coverage data for the `startWorker.js` file.
