User: I am using a VT100 terminal emulator on Linux. In bash, up and down arrows scroll through the last commands executed; they work as expected.
Previous (up arrow) and next (down arrow) commands are not interpreted in the Python command line interpreter. What kind of key mappings do I need to make this work?
Thank you.
Assistant: By default, the keymappings are:

older: alt-p
more recent: alt-n

You can change it in Options -> Configure IDLE -> Keys -> "history-previous" and "history-next" respectively.
