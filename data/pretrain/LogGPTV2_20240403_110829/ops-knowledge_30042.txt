User: Is there any way to run a Python script in Windows XP without a command shell momentarily appearing? I often need to automate WordPerfect (for work) with Python, and even if my script has no output, if I execute it from without WP an empty shell still pops up for a second before disappearing. Is there any way to prevent this? Some kind of output redirection perhaps?
Assistant: Turn of your window defender. And install pyinstaller package using pip install pyinstaller .
After installing open cmd and type pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole filename.py
