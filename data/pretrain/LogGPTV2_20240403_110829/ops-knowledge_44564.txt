User: i have a Python script here and it is called from the Windows CMD. 
It is executing some commands and also changing the Windows environment variables. Now after i changed them with the command "setx". I have to restart another Shell so the new variables are loaded into it. 
Is it possible that the main shell from which i called my script can update the variables itself ?
Or is it possible to start another shell with the new variables and the script will continue in the new opened shell ?
Thanks
Assistant: You can't change the value of a environment variable.
Allow me to clarify: environment variables represent the variables set on the environment of a process when that process starts. 
From the point-of-view of the new process, its environment is unchanging. Changing a variable on the environment (the process' parent) will not change the value of the environment variable seen by the process. Changing a variable on the process will not make it's environment see the change.
So, what can you change?

Variables set on your process. This is achieved in python by changing os.environ, or using set on the shell. Any changes will be seen by your process and any children you make (os.system, subprocess, most commands on the shell). 
Variables set by the system (what SetX does). These changes will be seen by any new process launched directly by the system (Explorer, in Windows) after you change them.
