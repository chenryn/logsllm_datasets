LogicAppsDescription & RationaleControlSeverityAutomatedFix ScriptMultiple Logic Apps should not be deployed in the same resource group unless they trust each otherAPI Connections contain critical information like credentials/secrets, etc., provided as part of configuration. Logic App can use all API Connections present in the same Resource Group. Thus, Resource Group should be considered as security boundary when threat modeling.HighYesNoLogic App connectors must have minimum required permissions on data sourceThis ensures that connectors can be used only towards intended actions in the Logic AppMediumNoNoAll users/identities must be granted minimum required permissions using Role Based Access Control (RBAC)Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.MediumYesNoIf Logic App fires on an HTTP Request (e.g. Request or Webhook) then provide IP ranges for triggers to prevent unauthorized accessSpecifying the IP range ensures that the triggers can be invoked only from a restricted set of endpoints.HighYesNoMust provide IP ranges for contents to prevent unauthorized access to inputs/outputs data of Logic App run historyUsing the firewall feature ensures that access to the data or the service is restricted to a specific set/group of clients. While this may not be feasible in all scenarios, when it can be used, it provides an extra layer of access control protection for critical assets.HighYesNoApplication secrets and credentials must not be in plain text in source code (code view) of a Logic AppKeeping secrets such as DB connection strings, passwords, keys, etc. in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's lifecycle. Storing them in a key vault ensures that they are protected at rest.HighYesNoLogic App access keys must be rotated periodicallyPeriodic key/password rotation is a good security hygiene practice as, over time, it minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise which can arise from key theft/brute forcing/recovery attacks.MediumNoNoDiagnostics logs must be enabled with a retention period of at least 365 days.Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.MediumYesNoLogic App Code View code should be backed up periodicallyLogic App code view contains application's workflow logic and API connections detail which could be lost if there is no backup. No backup/disaster recovery feature is available out of the box in Logic Apps.MediumNoNo
