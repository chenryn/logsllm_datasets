Is there a _correct way_ to replace core commands?  
_(of course, if this is something that is available or in the roadmap)_
My intention is to create an extension to replace _Edit / Copy
(`editor.action.clipboardCopyAction`)_ and _Edit / Cut
(`editor.action.clipboardCutAction`)_ commands. So, when there is no
selection, the _Copy/Cut_ would use the _current word_ instead of the _entire
line_.
About coding, I can:
  * Determine the word based on the cursor position
  * Select the word
  * Execute `vscode.commands.executeCommand("editor.action.clipboardCopyAction")`
  * Remove the selection, returning the cursor to its initial position.
But I was wondering if there is something else that I could (or couldn't) do,
like defining the `keybindings` in `package.json` to `Ctrl + C / Ctrl + X`; or
define `vscode.commands.registerCommand` for the core command, with my own
code.
Thanks in advance
