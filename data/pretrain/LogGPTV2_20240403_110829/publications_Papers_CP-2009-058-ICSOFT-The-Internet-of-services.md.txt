Abstract: The vision of the Internet of Services (IoS) can be seen as a new business model that can radically change
the way we discover, select, invoke and interact with services. In the same way that the Internet can be
viewed as a Web of Information, it can also be configured to support an Internet of Services. The IoS
describes an approach that uses the Internet as a medium for selling and purchasing services. As a result,
services become tradable entities. Service marketplaces, a logical location where providers and consumers
are brought together to trade services and to engage in business interaction, are enabling the creation of
platforms for the IoS vision. Thus, the IoS provides the business and technical base for advanced business
models where service providers and consumers form business networks for service provision and
consumption.
