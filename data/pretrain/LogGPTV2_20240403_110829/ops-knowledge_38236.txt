User: Please list common algorithms for server cluster load balancing, and briefly explain their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Common server cluster load balancing algorithms include: round robin algorithm, minimum connection number algorithm, hash algorithm, IP hash algorithm, weighted round robin algorithm and weighted minimum connection number algorithm. 1. Polling algorithm: Assign requests to each server in order, and each server processes the request after receiving it. The advantage is that it is easy to understand, fair and does not need to consider the server status; the disadvantage is that some servers may be overloaded. 2. Minimum number of connections algorithm: assign the request to the server with the least number of current connections. The advantage is that it can ensure a relatively balanced load and prevent some servers from being overloaded; the disadvantage is that the processing speed of the server may be slow. 3. Hash algorithm: Hash according to the specific attributes of the request and map it to a specific server. The advantage is that the same request can be distributed to the same server, which is convenient for caching and tracking; the disadvantage is that it is not easy to maintain when the number of servers and load imbalance occur. 4. IP hashing algorithm: Similar to the hashing algorithm, but will request the IP address to be hashed. The advantage is that it is simple and easy to understand, and it is suitable for widely distributed entities; the disadvantage is that when the IP addresses distributed in an area have access peaks, it will cause load imbalance. 5. Weighted round-robin algorithm: assign requests to each server according to the weight of the server, and servers with higher weights are assigned more requests. The advantage is that it is suitable for high-performance servers and high-speed networks, ensuring that the servers work according to the design goals; the disadvantage is that some servers may not be utilized at all. 6. Weighted Minimum Connections Algorithm: Similar to the Minimum Connections Algorithm, but allocates requests based on server weights. The advantage is that it can make full use of high-performance servers and avoid load imbalance; the disadvantage is that it is more complicated, and factors such as server status and network delay need to be considered.
