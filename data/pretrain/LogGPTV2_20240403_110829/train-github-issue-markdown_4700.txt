Was working on trying to inherit from a trait with a `` lifetime
parameter, like so:
    trait A { fn foo(&self) -> &'self str; }  trait B : A { fn bar(&self); }
and was getting this compile error:
    error: Illegal anonymous lifetime: anonymous lifetimes are not permitted here
    trait A { fn foo(&self) -> &'self str; }  trait B : A { fn bar(&self); }
                                                                                  ^~
    aborting due to previous error
So I thought maybe I could just annotate the inherited trait with the
lifetime:
    trait A { fn foo(&self) -> &'self str; }  trait B : A { fn bar(&self); }
which produced this ice:
    task  failed at 'region parameterization should have inferred that this type is RP', /home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/snap3-linux/build/src/librustc/middle/typeck/rscope.rs:238
    error: internal compiler error: unexpected failure
    note: the compiler hit an unexpected failure path. this is a bug
    note: try running with RUST_LOG=rustc=1,::rt::backtrace to get further details and report the results to github.com/mozilla/rust/issues
    task  failed at 'explicit failure', /home/rustbuild/src/rust-buildbot/slave/snap3-linux/build/src/librustc/rustc.rs:371
    make: *** [x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/stage0/lib/rustc/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib/libstd.so] Error 101
AFAICT, it's putting `` on `A` when declaring `B` is what's causing the
ICE.
