I'm trying to fix microsoft/vscode-go#103, but as far as I can tell this isn't
possible currently without tokenizing the whole file again in my extension and
manually checking whether I'm in a comment to suprress providing results.
It would be nice if the `CompletionItemProvider` provided a setting to
suppress it's results when in certain tokens/scopes.
The implementation of the TypeScript completion provider has an
`excludeTokens` which seems to play this role but I can't get that to work in
my own extension.
