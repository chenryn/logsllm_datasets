Vision of SocketV2V
Security through
obscurity leads to
inevitable pwning

Background on SocketV2V
Linux V2V development begins November 2015
Large body of existing work found to be incomplete
No open-source implementation exists
Attempts at integration in linux-wireless since 2004
Abandon e↵orts to patch previous attempts mid-2016
Two years of kernel debugging later, V2V is real

Motivation for V2X Development
Current standards for onboard vehicle communications not designed
to handle VANET
Increase in automation ) increase in attack surface
Auto industry calling for proprietary solutions
Leads to a monopolization of technology
Standards still incomplete and bound for change, proprietary solutions
become obsolete
Multiple alternative standards being developed independently across
borders
Imminent deployment requires immediate attention

Lessons Learned from Previous Epic Failure
1 You keep calling yourself
a kernel dev, I do not
think it means what you
think it means
2 Sharing is caring: closed-source development leads to failure
3 Standards committees need serious help addressing unprecedented
levels of complexity in new and future systems
