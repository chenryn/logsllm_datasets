We consider two cases (note that |S| is the number of buckets

we can replace the above inequality with

Combining all above, it sufﬁces to prove that
To see that Eq. (6) holds, consider the following two com-
binatorial processes: (1) choose tS balls out of M − C and
then choose (r − 1)· Bmin balls from the tS that were chosen
before; (2) choose (r − 1)· Bmin balls out of M − C balls. It
is easy to see that the number of ways to choose the tS balls
is higher in the second process as the selection of balls is less
restricted. Since the ﬁrst process corresponds to the left side
of Eq. (6) whereas the second process corresponds to the right
(cid:2)
side, we conclude that the theorem holds in this case.
Next, we proceed to the second case where tS ≥ M

Therefore, it holds that

(cid:3)  1, then
moving one ball from the bigger bucket Bi to the smaller
bucket Bj, will result in a game that is more difﬁcult for
the adversary to win. This proves that having buckets of
signiﬁcantly different sizes does not improve security, as one
can keep moving balls between buckets until all buckets are
of size B and B + 1 for some B. As explained earlier, the
intuition behind this is that reducing the gap between large
and small buckets in this way can only result in having fewer
buckets of smallest size, and therefore the probability that the
bad balls will be thrown into a bucket of smallest size can
only be reduced.
Theorem 5.6: Let (cid:2)B be a multiset of N bucket sizes that
was chosen for the game and assume that there exist i, j ∈ [N ]
such that Bi− Bj > 1. Let (cid:2)B(cid:2) be a multiset of N bucket sizes
obtained by setting

If C ≥ Bmin, then for every adversary A(cid:2) in the game
where (cid:2)B(cid:2) is used, there exists an adversary A in the game
where (cid:2)B is used such that
Pr[Game4(A(cid:2), N, (cid:2)B(cid:2), C) = 1] ≤ Pr[Game4(A, N, (cid:2)B, C) = 1]
Proof: Denote by Bmin the size of the smallest bucket in
(cid:2)B and by B(cid:2)
min the size of the smallest bucket in (cid:2)B(cid:2). From
Theorem 5.3, it follows that for every adversary A(cid:2) as in the
lemma it holds that
Pr[Game4(A(cid:2), N, (cid:2)B(cid:2), C) = 1]

prove that n(B(cid:2)
the process of changing (cid:2)B to (cid:2)B(cid:2), the number of buckets
with smallest size can only decrease (note that since only
one bucket can be ﬁlled when t = Bmin, then n(Bmin)
equals the number of buckets of minimal size).
min > Bmin. This case can occur only if there
was exactly one bucket of size Bmin in (cid:2)B, and it gained one
• Case 2: B(cid:2)
ball in the process of changing (cid:2)B to (cid:2)B(cid:2). Thus, it follows
that B(cid:2)
min = Bmin + 1 and n(Bmin) = 1. Thus, we can
replace Eq. (9) with

n(Bmin) ≤ N as there are N buckets in the game. Thus,
in order to complete the proof, we need to show that

This holds since, as explained before, in this case there was
exactly one bucket of size Bmin, one bucket of size at least
Bmin + 2 (from which one ball was moved to the ﬁrst
bucket) and all other buckets are of size at least Bmin + 1
(otherwise, B(cid:2)
