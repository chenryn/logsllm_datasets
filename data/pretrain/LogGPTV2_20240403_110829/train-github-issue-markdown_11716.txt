Hi! I am writing some site (taxi with google maps in real time for our city),
and I was created modal with form (for selecting taxi filters and your
coordinates), and height of this modal was bigger, than height of my
smartphone screen. I was tried to scroll modal down, to select other filters,
and modal just was not scrollable. I tried to open and scroll modal from
Bootstrap docs, and it too was not scrollable. I tried same on Android 4, and
it worked normal. Can you fix opened modal scrolling for Android 2?
P.S. Sorry for my bad English.
