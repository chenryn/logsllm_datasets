### Mobile OS Security Measures for Malicious SMS Activities

Mobile operating systems, such as Android, typically halt malicious SMS activities until the user explicitly permits them through a pop-up dialog. This ensures that users are aware of and consent to any potentially harmful actions.

### SMS Spoofing

**Definition and Threat:**
SMS spoofing occurs when an attacker replaces the originator's phone number with another, allowing them to send messages on behalf of another mobile user. This threat is present in both Circuit-Switched (CS) and Internet-based SMS services.

**CS-Based SMS:**
- **Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability in CS-based SMS stems from the lack of mutual authentication in 2G networks. Mobile phones do not need to authenticate their serving networks, making it possible for them to connect to fake 2G networks.
- **Impact:** Through these fake networks, attackers can easily send spoofed SMS messages. Although law enforcement agencies can detect such activities, there are no comprehensive solutions to eliminate all fake networks or prevent devices from connecting to them.
- **Future Outlook:** Despite some carriers planning to retire 2G networks, many will maintain 2G backward compatibility for years, prolonging this vulnerability.

**Internet-Based SMS:**
- **Vulnerability:** Internet-based SMS providers often do not restrict the originator number to the actual sender. This allows customers to maliciously send spoofed SMS messages on behalf of other users.
- **Example:** An attacker could send a spoofed message on behalf of a victim to a charity organization, forcing the victim to donate money.
- **Prevention:** Authenticating the originator numbers of SMS messages can mitigate this threat. However, since this mechanism is not standardized and relies on individual providers, its effectiveness is uncertain.

**IMS-Based SMS:**
- **Current Defenses:** Existing defenses against SMS spoofing, which target either fake 2G networks or Internet-based services, are not applicable to IMS-based SMS.
- **New Threats:** Our identified threat involves malicious mobile users within the mobile network itself, rather than external sources.

### New Security Issues in IMS-Based SMS

We investigate the security issues of IMS-based SMS by considering the differences from legacy, CS-based SMS. The key differences are:
1. **SMS Client Design:** Software-based vs. hardware-based.
2. **SMS Protocol Design:** Different levels of flexibility.
3. **Communication Channel:** Data-plane vs. control-plane.
4. **Stipulated Security Mechanisms:** Varying standards and implementations.

#### Software-Based Client Design
- **Flexibility:** IMS-based SMS uses a software-based client, which is more flexible and customizable but also more vulnerable to attacks.
- **Threats:** A malicious user can hijack the SMS client to attack the IMS system or send forged messages.

#### Flexible Protocol Design
- **SIP Protocol:** The SIP protocol used in IMS-based SMS is more flexible, allowing the device to specify control information in the SMS header.
- **Security Concerns:** Without strict security checks, this flexibility can be exploited to forge harmful SMS messages.

#### Data-Plane Communication Channel
- **Shift in Channel:** IMS shifts the communication channel from the control plane to the data plane.
- **Security Gaps:** Well-tested security mechanisms for control-plane signaling are not applicable to the IMS system, making it vulnerable to threats like VoLTE.

#### Stipulated Security Mechanisms
- **Standards:** 3GPP and 3GPP2 standards differ in their security mechanisms. 3GPP mandates IPSec-3GPP, while 3GPP2 offers multiple options, including TLS, DIGEST, and others.
- **Risks:** The variability in security mechanisms can expose the IMS system to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Threat Model and Methodology

- **Victims:** Mobile users, carriers, and SMS-powered service providers.
- **Attacker:** A mobile user with a rooted smartphone, capable of gaining full control of the mobile OS.
- **Validation:** We validate vulnerabilities and attacks using three Android phone models (Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy S6, LG G3) and two top-tier US carriers (OP-I and OP-II).
- **Ethical Considerations:** We use our own phones and unlimited SMS plans to ensure responsible testing without causing harm.

### New Threats from IMS-Based SMS

We identify four new vulnerabilities in the IMS-based SMS, enabling silent SMS abuse and SMS spoofing. These vulnerabilities range from the phone to the IMS server and include:

#### SIP Session Vulnerabilities

1. **Leakage of SIP Session Information:**
   - **Description:** SIP session information (e.g., message format, session parameters) can be leaked, allowing attackers to fabricate legal SIP messages.
   - **Validation:** We use the Shark application to capture SIP messages. For OP-I, the messages are in plain text, while for OP-II, we decrypt the messages using IPSec keys.
   - **Causes and Lessons:** The 3GPP2 standard's flexibility in security mechanisms can lead to inadequate protection. Carriers may prefer simpler, less secure methods due to cost concerns.

2. **Injection of Forged SIP Messages:**
   - **Description:** Forged SIP messages can be injected into the SIP session, accepted by the IMS server if they have the correct session identifier.
   - **Validation:** We demonstrate that an application without root access can inject a forged SIP message into the session for OP-I, while root access is required for OP-II.
   - **Exploitation:** Exploiting this vulnerability does not require root access for OP-I but does for OP-II.

These findings highlight the need for enhanced security measures in IMS-based SMS to protect against new and evolving threats.
