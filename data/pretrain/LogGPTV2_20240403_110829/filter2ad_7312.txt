Abstract
The DSN Workshop on Self-Stabilization’s programme
includes ﬁfteen research presentations. The main ar-
eas in the programme are network protocols, sensor net-
works, distributed algorithms, methods for analysis of
self-stabilization, distributed system fault tolerance, and
techniques used in the construction of systems that self-
stabilize.
1. Workshop Goals and Areas
Self-stabilization contrasts with other approaches to
dependable systems: instead of entirely masking failures
by replication or safe storage, or using backward recov-
ery to restore system state, self-stabilization is pure for-
ward recovery, tolerating any degree of transient failure.
Though self-stabilization has been a standard algorithmic
topic of distributed systems, there is now renewed interest
due to emerging concerns of scalability and more extreme
distribution of system control. There is also recognition
that system components become more valuable if they are
individually self-stabilizing.
The Workshop on Self-stabilizing Systems has been
a biennial workshop. The workshop has been a high-
quality research forum held in collaboration with other
major conferences in related areas: ACM STOC (1995),
ACM PODC (1997), IEEE ICDCS (1999), DISC (2001),
and many workshop results have been subsequently pub-
lished in journals (including special issues devoted to self-
stabilization). Meetings of researchers interested in self-
stabilization have been stimulating and useful. At work-
shops, new adaptations of stabilization have been pro-
posed, new technical advances in algorithms and anal-
ysis have been discussed, and perhaps most important,
new problem areas and applications suited to the stabi-
lization approach became known to a wider community.
This workshop continued these themes with high-quality
research presentations and open discussion of the latest
results and most exciting new directions. In addition to
the ﬁfteen technical presentations summarized below, an
invited presentation was given by Anish Arora.
2. Summary of Presentations
We start by summarizing some topical contributions,
inspired by biological and emerging sensor network ar-
eas.
In “Self-stabilizing pulse synchronization inspired
by biological pacemaker networks” (Ariel Daliot, Danny
Dolev, Hanna Parnas), the problem of achieving synchro-
nization of periodic pulse events of nodes is investigated.
It is a phenomenon of many distributed biological sys-
tems, and this paper shows how to deal with Byzantine
behavior of the processes. The presentation “A pursuer-
evader game for sensor networks” (Murat Demirbas,
Anish Arora, Mohamed Gouda) researches several ap-
proaches to tunable, energy-efﬁcient and self-stabilizing
pursuer strategies in a pursuer-evader game in sensor net-
works. This is a new area where self-stabilization is ex-
pected to have a large impact. One approach is evader-
centric; another is pursuer-centric; and a hybrid approach
is tunable between these two poles. The sensor network
theme continues in “Collision-free communication in sen-
sor networks” (Sandeep S. Kulkarni, Umamaheswaran
Arumugam) where the problem of diffusing information
in a wireless sensor/actuator network while avoiding col-
lision is solved. By using a pattern of staged time-division
multiplexing in a network, messages propagate without
colliding.
The following papers, presented at the workshop, study
network or distributed system protocols. In “A stabiliz-
ing solution to the stable paths problem” (Jorge A. Cobb,
Mohamed G. Gouda, Ravi Musunuri) the issue is routing
stability, which is a problem in routing protocols such as
BGP. A technique of diffusing computation enables nodes
to select paths so as to avoid instabilities. “Route pre-
serving stabilization” (Colette Johnen, S´ebastien Tixeuil)
presents a self-stabilizing shortest path spanning tree al-
gorithm for semi-uniform systems with a distributed de-

tion chosen here is the network’s quantization error, which
must decrease for asymptotic stability to hold.
Theoretical studies are represented by several presen-
tations. “Self-stabilizing algorithms for {k}-domination”
(Martin Gairing, Stephen T. Hedetniemi, Petter Kris-
tiansen, Alice A. McRae) develops an algorithm to
achieve the graph-theoretic {k}-dominating function
(also giving a linear-time algorithm for a {2}-dominating
function). The presentation “A method for evaluating
efﬁciency of protocols on the asynchronous shared-state
model” (Yoshihiro Nakaminami, Toshimitsu Masuzawa,
Ted Herman) is a technical result; its contribution is a
characterization of algorithms for which the asynchronous
complexity can be derived from the (more readily calcu-
lated) synchronous time complexity. “An improved snap-
stabilizing PIF algorithm” (L´elia Blin, Alain Cournier,
Vincent Villain) removes the assumption of knowing the
network size from a snap-stabilizing solution to Propaga-
tion of Information with Feedback in a network of pro-
cesses.
In addition to these prepared presentations, the work-
shop programme also makes time for a general discussion
of future directions and open problems. This is an oppor-
tunity to exchange ideas and suggest new challenges and
opportunities for the unique type of fault tolerance that
self-stabilization offers. The workshop papers are pub-
lished by Springer in the Lecture Notes on Computer Sci-
ence (LNCS) series.
mon. The algorithm is adaptive to edge cost changes: it
is loop free, meaning that any such change will maintain
a tree, and route preserving, meaning that every message
sent to the root is eventually received even if continuous
cost changes occur. Shlomi Dolev and Elad Schiller con-
tinue work from the 2001 workshop in “Self-stabilizing
group communication in directed networks”, which gen-
eralizes previous work that considered undirected com-
munication links. The algorithms in this presentation
cover several algorithm variations, including token circu-
lation in a virtual ring and spanning tree structures.
Distributed system issues motivate much of the foun-
dational work on self-stabilization. “A framework of safe
stabilization” (Sukumar Ghosh, Alina Bejan) examines
the intersection of self-stabilization and system safety (a
core concern in dependable systems). Under certain con-
ditions, systems can move to a known safe state, even
if full restoration of legitimate behavior is not possible.
The paper “Self-stabilizing atomicity reﬁnement allowing
neighborhood concurrency” (S´ebastien Cantarell, Ajoy K.
Datta) considers a problem of resource sharing in a net-
work model. By using a self-stabilizing transformer from
a high-level model to a more realistic one, the solution
allows more concurrency, while hiding low-level activity
from higher layers. Resource allocation is also a subject
in “A new self-stabilizing k-out-of-(cid:1) exclusion algorithm
on rings” (Ajoy K. Datta, Rachid Hadid, Vincent Vil-
lain), which proposes a new metric for the evaluation of (cid:1)-
exclusion. “A self-stabilizing algorithm for token circula-
tion by using edge-tokens” (Shing-Tsaan Huang, Su-Shen
Hung) presents a uniform token-circulation algorithm us-
ing edge tokens. The proposed work is better in some
respect (either uniformity or the stabilization time) than
all previous algorithms for the same problem and model.
The algorithm uses a uniform technique to fairly traverse
a token around a tree with O(n) convergence time.
Many of the papers already mentioned contribute to the
store of techniques known to stabilize distributed systems.
Some research presentations focus especially on methods
for constructing self-stabilizing systems and algorithms.
From the presentation “A general method for construct-
ing self-stabilizing algorithms with logarithmic time com-
plexity” (Felix C. G¨artner, Henning Pagnia) we see how
the convergence time complexity of self-stabilization can
be reduced, and fault containment improved, by carefully
partitioning system components, structuring them into a
hierarchy, and using an overlay network to restrict com-
munication. “Lyapunov analysis of neural network stabil-
ity in an adaptive ﬂight control system” (Sampath Yerra-
malla, Bojan Cukic, Martin Mladenovski, Edgar Fuller)
emphasizes the link between system adaptivity and self-
stabilization, featuring a case study. The Lyapunov func-
