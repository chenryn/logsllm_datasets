as explained in Section 4.3 and illustrated in Fig. 7. In our
results, around 10% stable hijackings will not be identiﬁed if
sub-preﬁx is ignored, i.e., the live IP belongs to a sub-preﬁx
of the preﬁx we are interested in.
In the identiﬁcation module, we now keep a pool of 389
route-servers and looking glasses widely distributed in 41
transit ASes, 14 to sense both the control and the data plane
status of the Internet in a pervasive manner. Transit AS-
es, including default-free ASes, can sense the diverse paths
to diﬀerent preﬁxes in the Internet. In contrast, other dis-
tributed monitoring platforms, such as the Planetlab, often
concentrate in stub ASes, such as academic networks, and
often use a default route for their traﬃc. To avoid overload-
ing the eyes, for each anomalous event, we randomly choose
40 ∼ 80 eyes from our server pool, and use them to compute
the corresponding ﬁngerprint and reachability. Using more
than one eye in the same transit AS can improve accuracy
and provide better redundancy, since diﬀerent eyes may ex-
perience diﬀerent paths to the same preﬁx 15 and diﬀerent
inconsistencies between their control and data plane.
When computing the ﬁngerprint Ft, a hijacking may be
missed due to the division-by-zero problem. However, in our
data, the chance that Ct equals 1 (i.e., no eye is polluted) is
only 3%, and the chance that Dt equals 0 (i.e., all eyes are
blindfolded) is less than 20%. 16 The case that Ct = 0 (i.e.,
all eyes are polluted) or Dt = 1 (i.e., all eyes can reach the
live IP) never occurs. So the probability that a hijacking
is missed due to the failure point of Ft is very likely to be
small.
It is worth to note that, the number of ASes in which
eyes are employed is very important. In the early stage of
our system deployment, our eyes covered less than 20 tran-
sit ASes in the Internet, and almost half of the anomalous
events could not be seen by any of our eyes. This is deﬁnite-
ly a major contributor to the false negatives of our system
at that time. However, we kept adding more usable eyes,
especially in more ASes, and now less than 2% anomalous
events may be missed by all the eyes used in identiﬁcation.
Last, we do not use very large µ and T , so hijackings with
unstable ﬁngerprints can also be identiﬁed. As has been
demonstrated, they do not aﬀect the false positive rate very
much.
In conclusion, although there is no direct proof for the
many such cases are indeed not hijackings, but are caused
by route failure, ﬁrewall, no active hosts, etc..
14A complete list of the eyes we employ can be found at
http://argus.csnet1.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/static/eyes.txt.
15The chance that two eyes in the same AS experience dif-
ferent paths is 39% in our experiments.

false negative possibility of Argus, we believe it can detect
a large fraction of blackholing hijackings in the Internet,
and can liberate network operators from a vast number of
alarms. In the rest of this paper, we will make a systematic
analysis on our monitoring results.
5.3 Monitoring Results
The 40K anomalous route events reported by the AMM
consist of 20K origin anomalies, 6.7K adjacency anomalies
and 13.3K policy anomalies. From these events, the HIM
identiﬁed 220 stable hijackings, in which 122 hijackings in-
troduced origin anomalies, while 71 and 27 hijackings intro-
duced adjacency and policy anomalies, respectively. How-
ever, since the monitoring of the three kinds of anomalies
started at diﬀerent time, these numbers are not directly
comparable. Instead, in Fig. 16(a) and 16(b), we plot the
weekly numbers of stable hijackings and route anomalies of
each type, starting from May 2011. Notice there is no data
for AA and PA anomalies until November 2011. For compar-
ison, we also plot the weekly numbers of the 790 suspicious
hijacking alarms in Fig. 16(c).
As shown in Fig 16(a), the frequencies of diﬀerent types
of stable hijackings are somewhat steady and comparable in
the whole year, with an average of three new hijackings per
week. The higher values in the starting points may just be
caused by accumulation. One notable point is that, adja-
cency and policy based hijackings do exist in the Internet,
and to the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to detect
and study them.
The trend of anomalies and suspicious hijackings is almost
similar to that of stable hijackings. The only diﬀerence is
that, the number of policy anomalies is far larger than the
other types of anomalies, but the number of policy based hi-
jackings is not that large. It is reasonable because the num-
ber of neighboring AS triples (i.e., policies) is much larger
than the number of origins or neighboring AS pairs 17, while
most anomalies are not hijackings.
Fig. 17 plots the CDF of the hijacking duration for all
stable hijackings. The duration is computed oﬀ-line by ex-
amining when the corresponding route anomalies disappear
from the routing UPDATEs, representing how long a hijack-
ing will aﬀect the Internet. It covers a very large range, from
less than 10 minutes to longer than one week, both of which
have a non-negligible fraction and are worth further studies.
For example, more than 20% hijackings last less than 10
minutes, and these short (but not transient) hijackings ask
for a realtime detector such as Argus. On the other hand,
those long hijackings indicate that, this security problem is
either ignored by or is still unknown to some ISPs, or it is
17In the past year, 925K neighboring AS triples, 606K preﬁx-
origin pairs and 108K AS edges were monitored by Argus.

very hard to defend against. It should also be noted that, in
order to reduce the workload of the eyes, we only use BGP
UPDATEs to determine when a hijacking event ends, so it
is possible that some long lasting hijackings are just route
migrations which happen to exhibit hijacking characteristics
in their early stage.
In total, we detected around 40K anomalous preﬁxes, of
which 1132 appeared in suspicious alarms, while 263 ap-
peared in stable hijackings. We call a preﬁx most speciﬁc if
it has no sub-preﬁx announced to the Internet. Since routers
prefer most speciﬁc preﬁxes, it is reasonable that hijackings
also prefer them so that they can pollute the Internet more
eﬀectively, as in the Youtube event [29]. Fig. 18 shows the
ratio of such most speciﬁc preﬁxes, in all announced pre-
ﬁxes, hijacked preﬁxes and suspicious preﬁxes, respectively,
where hijackings show a clear favor for most speciﬁc ones.
In stable hijackings, about 91% preﬁxes are most speciﬁc,
while the ratio in all announced preﬁxes is 87%. This fa-
vor is especially evident for shorter preﬁxes whose impact
is greater.
In all the preﬁxes with a length less than 18,
the average percentage of most speciﬁc preﬁxes is only 50%,
while the ratio becomes 100% in stable hijackings (the ratio
is 70% in all suspicious alarms). On the other hand, sub-
preﬁx hijackings (using a more speciﬁc preﬁx than a normal
one) contribute around 10% in stable hijackings.
To illustrate how these hijackings aﬀect the Internet, Fig.
19 depicts how many ASes in the Internet a hijacking can
successfully pollute (hijack), and Fig. 20 depicts how fast
hijackings can pollute them. Since most ASes in the Internet
are stub/customer ASes which use default routes to their
providers for many preﬁxes, they cannot be seen in any of
the UPDATEs for those preﬁxes. The numbers in these two
ﬁgures only cover the transit ASes seen in the UPDATEs
for the corresponding (hijacked) preﬁxes, while the actually
aﬀected area should also include their customers.
In Fig.
19, more than 20% stable hijackings can pollute at least
80 ASes, while in Fig. 20, on average, more than 20 ASes
are polluted within only two minutes. For each hijacking
that aﬀects more than 80 transit ASes, we also compute the
ratio of the number of polluted ASes (in a certain period)
to the number of ASes that can be seen in all UPDATEs
for the corresponding preﬁx. This metric can be regarded
as a rough estimator of what percentage of the Internet is
polluted, and in some cases, more than 50% of the Internet
are polluted within 20 seconds, and more than 90% of the
Internet are polluted in less than two minutes.
On the other hand, in Fig. 19, origin based hijackings usu-
ally can pollute more ASes than adjacency or policy based
hijackings. For example, about 70% in the former case can
pollute at least 50 transit ASes, while only around 30% of
the latter two cases have this capability. Similarly, origin
based hijackings often pollute the Internet in a faster way,
as shown in Fig. 20. For example, on average, an origin
based hijacking can pollute about 26 transit ASes in two
minutes, and can pollute more than 30 in ten minutes. Part
of the reasons may be that, when forging preﬁx-origin pairs,
most speciﬁc preﬁxes are often used, with short AS-paths.
It is also interesting that a hijacking can hardly pollute
all ASes. Due to this reason, the chance that all our eyes
are polluted is also low, which helps them to get a more
accurate detection result.
6. CASE STUDIES
In this section, we analyze the characteristics and root
causes of some interesting hijackings, as well as some non-
hijacking anomalies, in order to help increase the under-
standing of preﬁx hijackings in the Internet.
Table 2 summarizes the hijacking cases discussed in this
section, including ﬁve cases with origin anomalies, three with
adjacency anomalies and two with policy anomalies. Most of
these hijackings have been conﬁrmed by the corresponding
network operators, while for other cases, we will present
enough evidence.
