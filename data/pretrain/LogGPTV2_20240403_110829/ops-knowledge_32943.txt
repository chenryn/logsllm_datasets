User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Can I compress an encrypted file? I have an encrypted file (AES Symmetric encryption).For backup purposes and to save disk space, Can I compress (lossless) the file without worrying about messing up the decryption? If so, can you recommend some good compression programs for this purpose?

Assistant: You can compress it, but it is unlikely to save much disk space. By its nature, encryption rarely leaves a file compressible by much.

Try it for yourself to see if there is any file size savings.

One data point:

-rw-r----- 1 gene    gene    2428671 2009-06-02 12:39 test.log
-rw-r----- 1 gene    gene     134524 2009-06-02 12:39 test.log.bz2
-rw-r----- 1 gene    gene     217162 2009-06-02 12:38 test.log.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 gene    gene     263229 2009-06-02 12:47 test-AES.gpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 gene    gene     264833 2009-06-02 12:42 test-AES.gpg.bz2
-rw-r--r-- 1 gene    gene     263302 2009-06-02 12:41 test-AES.gpg.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 gene    gene     134609 2009-06-02 12:43 test-bz2-AES.gpg
-rw-r--r-- 1 gene    gene     217246 2009-06-02 12:43 test-gz-AES.gpg


test.log is the original, and test.log.bz2 and test.log.gz are simply compressed with bzip2 and gzip, respectively.

If I encrypt it (gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES --output test-AES.gpg test.log) the encrypted file (test-AES.gpg) is slightly larger than compressed versions. Compressing the encrypted file actually adds a little size (test-AES.gpg.bz2 and test-AES.gpg.gz).

Compressing first then encrypting does show some savings (test-bz2-AES.gpg and test-gz-AES.gpg), especially with bzip2.

Of course, your experience may differ given different encryption software and/or different compression software.

You should consider whether the file size savings you get simply via encryption is enough, or if compressing then encrypting is worth the extra step in the process.
