User: I am on OSX Snow Leopard (10.6.2) I can install anything I need to. I would preferably like a Python or Java solution. I have searched on Google and found lots of information on writing my own program to do this, but this is a just a quick and dirty experiment so I don't want to invest a lot of time on writing a bunch of code to do this, I am sure someone else has done this already. 
This is off-topic now, do not use this question as an example of why your recommendations request is on topic, it is not. I apologize, but my Google-Foo was failing me the day I asked this 4 years ago!
Assistant: I have used Saxon 6.5 for years for command line transformations.  (Java, XSLT 1)
An excellent fallback if a native solution is not available.
