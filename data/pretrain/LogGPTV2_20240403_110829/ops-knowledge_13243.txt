User: How to protect the security of the database? Please suggest common attack methods and list corresponding defense measures.
Assistant: Common database attack methods include: 1. SQL injection attack (SQL Injection): By injecting malicious code into web applications, the purpose of stealing, modifying, and deleting database data is achieved. Defensive measures: filter user input, escape special characters, use prepared statements, minimize authorization, use ORM. 2. Denial of service attack (DDoS): By sending a large number of requests to the database server, occupying system resources to achieve the purpose of denial of service. Defensive measures: Use firewalls to monitor and block traffic, improve hardware configuration to complete load balancing, and set timeout mechanisms. 3. Database vulnerability attack: Attackers steal data, tamper with data, and destroy system security by exploiting vulnerabilities in the database system. Defensive measures: timely install database patches and security updates, restrict database access, use firewalls to limit IP ranges, and conduct security audit monitoring. 4. Password cracking attack: The attacker keeps trying a variety of different user password combinations to crack the database account password. Defensive measures: Set complex passwords, store passwords encrypted, use password policies, disable default usernames and passwords. 5. Version expiration attack: By using an expired or obsolete database version, an attacker can exploit the loopholes in the database system itself. Defensive measures: Do not use outdated database software, update the latest version and install security patches in time, strengthen security awareness, and require users to change their passwords.
