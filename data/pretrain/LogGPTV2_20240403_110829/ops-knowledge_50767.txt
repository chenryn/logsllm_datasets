User: I have access to old linux server(debian) and default Python is 2.6. To start my scripts I need Python 2.7. When I type python to console always 2.6 starts
(I have installed 2.7 and when I want to run I use command pythonbrew use 2.7.2)
How to avoid to type this and set that Python 2.7 is default?
Assistant: Specify Python 2.7's executable in the shebang of your scripts. Don't screw with the system Python.
