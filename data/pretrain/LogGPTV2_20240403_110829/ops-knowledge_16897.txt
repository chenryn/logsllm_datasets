User: I have a tornado application that will serve data via websocket.
I have a separate blocking thread which is reading input from another application and pushing an object into a Queue and another thread which has a blocking listener to that Queue.
What I would like is for the reader thread to somehow send a message to tornado whenever it sees a new item in the Queue and then tornado can relay that via websocket to listening clients.
The only way I can think to do this is to have a websocket client in the reader thread and push the information to tornado via websocket. However it seems that I should be able to do this without using websocket and somehow have tornado listen for non websocket async events and then call a callback.
But I can't find anything describing how to do this.
Assistant: If I'm understanding your question correctly, all you need to do is call IOLoop.add_callback from the thread that is reading from the queue.  This will run your callback in the IOLoop's thread so you can write your message out on the client websocket connections.
