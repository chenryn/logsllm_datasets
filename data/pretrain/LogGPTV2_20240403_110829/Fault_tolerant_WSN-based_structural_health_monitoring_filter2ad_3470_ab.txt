computational overhead because wireless sensor nodes have 
limited  computational  power.    Based  on  the  discussion 
[10] 
above, they are not suitable for a fault-tolerant WSN-based 
SHM system. 
III.  PROPOSED METHOD 
In  this  section,  the  proposed  method  will  be  described.   
The whole strategy is divided into two stages: faulty nodes 
detection  and  structural  damage  detection.  Two  types  of 
structural  characteristics,  namely  natural  frequencies  and 
mode  shapes,  are  extracted  from  measured  data  and 
respectively used in the above two stages. 
Before  we  introduce  the  method,  we  will  first  briefly 
introduce natural frequencies and mode shapes.

larger  amplitude  at  some  frequencies  than  others.  These

frequencies.  Natural 
frequencies  are  internal  vibration  characteristic  of  structure 
and  are different  for different  structures.    When a structure 
is  vibrating  under  one  of  its  natural  frequencies,  the 
corresponding  vibration pattern  it  exhibits  is called  a  mode 
shape for this natural frequency.     
For  example,  we  deploy  a  total  of  m  sensor  nodes  on  a 
structure and identify a total of p vibration patterns from the 
measurement  of  these  sensors.  The  corresponding  natural 
frequency set and mode shapes are denoted respectively as:

where f(cid:2921)   (k=1…p)  is  the  kth  natural  frequency, (cid:2742)(cid:2921) 
(k=1,...p)    is the mode shape corresponding to   f(cid:2921). (cid:1284)(cid:2919)(cid:2921)  (i 
=  1,  2,  …,m)  is  the  value  of (cid:2742)(cid:2921)  at  the  ith  sensor.  As  an 
example, Fig. 4 illustrates the first three natural frequencies 
and  corresponding  mode  shapes  of  a  typical  cantilevered 
beam, extracted from the measurements of the deployed 12 
sensor nodes.

The differences of natural frequencies and mode shapes 
can  be  observed  by  comparing  Eq.  (1a)  with  Eq.  (1b). 
Theoretically  speaking,  the  natural  frequencies  are  global 
parameters  of  a  structure  which  means  that,  using  sensor 
nodes deployed on different location of a structure, the same 
set  of  natural  frequencies  can  be  obtained.  This  spatial 
redundancy in natural frequencies makes them quite suitable 
for  faulty  nodes  detection  since  the  natural  frequencies 
extracted from the healthy nodes will be different from those 
obtained from faulty ones. However, natural frequencies are 
not  suitable  structural  characteristics  to  detect  structural 
damage due to the two reasons. First, natural frequencies are 
not  a  sensitive  indicator  to  detect  structural  damage.  Only

frequencies.  Second,  due  to  the  global  property  of  natural

In  this  paper,  faulty  sensor  nodes  are  first  detected  by 
comparing  the  extracted  natural  frequencies.  After  faulty 
nodes have been detected and isolated, we use mode shapes 
to detect possible structural damage. 
A.  Clustering 
The  first  stage  of  the  paper  is  to  divide  the  deployed 
sensor nodes into a number of clusters. Clustering must meet 
the following constraints:   
1.  Sensor  nodes  in  each  cluster  belong  to  the  same 
substructure. 
2.  Sensor  nodes  in  each  cluster  are  within  the  single 
hop communication range to its cluster head (CH) 
the  clusters  in  the  same  substructure  are 
connected together through the overlapping nodes.   
3.  All 
The justification of these constraints is as follows. 
First,  although  natural  frequencies  are  theoretically 
global parameters for a structure, it is practically impossible 
for  every  sensor  node  to  get  the  same  set  of  natural 
frequencies  due  to  the  structural  nonlinearity  and  the 
environmental  noise.    For  example, in a suspension bridge, 
the  natural  frequencies  extracted  from  the  sensor  nodes 
deployed  on  cables,  piers,  or  spans  can  be  significantly 
different.    For  large  structures,  the  spatial  redundancy  in 
natural  frequencies  only  preserved  well  in  sensor  nodes 
deployed 
the  same  substructure  (i.e.  component). 
Therefore,  to  detect  faulty  sensor  nodes,  it  is  necessary  to 
partition the sensor nodes into clusters where sensor nodes in 
each cluster belong to the same substructure. 
Second, we set the single-hop constraint by considering 
the  synchronization  error and  wireless  communication. The 
identification  of  natural  frequencies  and  mode  shapes 
requires that the measurement data of involved sensor nodes 
in 
should  be  synchronized.    The  synchronization  error  should 
also  be  within  1ms  to  avoid  any  consequent  undesirable 
effect  on  the  accuracy  of  identified  parameters  [15].   
Current  time  synchronization  protocols,  such  as  FTSP[16], 
RBS[17], will accumulate error with the number of hops. We 
therefore  set  the  single-hop  constraint 
the 
synchronization  error.  Another  reason  for  this  constraint  is 
that relaying large amount of sampled data through multiple 
hops consumes energy as well as wireless bandwidth. 
to  control 
in 
for  each  cluster 
Besides  the  substructure  and  single-hop  constraints,  we 
also require that all the clusters in the same substructure are 
connected through the overlapping nodes. This constraint is 
associated  with  the  property  as  well  as  the  identification 
methods  of  mode  shapes.    In  this  paper,  we  use  the 
curvature of the mode shapes in each substructure to detect 
and locate structure damage. To obtain the mode shapes of a 
substructure,  mode  shapes 
this 
substructure are first identified and then ‘stitched’ together. 
However,  since  mode  shape  vectors  identified  in  a  cluster 
only  represent  the  relative  vibration  amplitudes  at  cluster 
sensor nodes, mode shapes of different clusters may not be 
able to be assembled together. This can be demonstrated in 
Fig. 5(a), where the deployed 12 sensor nodes in Fig. 4 are 
partitioned into three clusters to identify the 3rd mode shape. 
Although  the  mode  shape  of  each  cluster  is  correctly 
identified, we cannot stitch them together. The key to solve 
this  problem  is  overlapping.  We  must  ensure  that  each 
cluster has at least one node which also belongs to another 
cluster  and  all  the  clusters  are  connected  through  the 
overlapping nodes.  For  example,  in  Fig.  5(b),  mode  shapes 
identified in each of the three clusters can be assembled. 
Figure 5 Mode shape assembling when (a) clusters do not overlap (b) 
clusters overlap 
Under these constraints, we need to minimize the number 
of  clusters  since  the  amount  of  wireless  data  transmission 
required for identifying natural frequencies and mode shapes 
is  decreased  with  the  cluster  size.  The  justification  of  this 
point will be given in more detail in Section B and D. 
Since satisfying the first constraint is straightforward and 
involve  only  civil  domain  knowledge,  before  formally 
formulate  the  above  clustering  problem,  we  assume  that 
sensor networks have already been partitioned according to 
the substructures they belong. We therefore only concentrate 
on how to further clustering the nodes in each substructure to 
satisfy the last two requirements and minimize the number of 
clusters. Thus the problem becomes: 
Given  a  sensor  network  G  =  (V,E),  find  a  clustering 
scheme that can cluster these V sensor nodes into q clusters, 
denoted as C = {S1, S2, S3,  ·  ·  ·, Sq}, subject to the following 
constraints: 
1)   (cid:1515)S(cid:3167)(cid:1488)CS(cid:2919)(cid:3404)V 
2)  Let  the  sub-graph  for  Si  be  G(Si,Ei),  where  Ei (cid:1599)  E. 
Then (cid:1482)S(cid:2919)(cid:1488)C, (cid:1484)s(cid:2919)(cid:1488)S(cid:2919), such that there is an edge aij (cid:1488)  Ei 
between si and any other s(cid:2920)(cid:1488)S(cid:2919)  (si ≠ sj)

Objective: Minimize q 
The  first  constraint  is  set  because  we  wish  to  find  the 
mode shape values defined on all the deployed sensor nodes. 
The  second  constraint  is  to  ensure  only  single-hop  clusters 
are generated. Constraints 3 and 4 are used to describe that 
generated clusters are overlapping and connected.   
This  problem  can  be  proved  to  be  NP  complete  by 
reducing  the  set  cover  problem  [4]  to  it.    However,  the 
detailed proof is omitted for brevity. 
We  design  a  greedy  centralized  algorithm  to  solve  our 
clustering  problem.  Our  algorithm  uses  the  similar  idea  of 
designing the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem but 
with  modifications  to  handle  the  extra  constraints  of 
clustering.  The  algorithm  has  two  parts.  First,  given  the 
graph  G  = (V,E),  it  will  define  a  cluster  set   C(cid:2919)   for every 
sensor node i  ∈  V . Each C(cid:2919)  contains a CH, i.e. i, and all 
its one-hop neighbours. All the cluster sets will be treated as 
subsets in the set cover problem. Then the greedy approach 
is adopted to select the cluster which is able to cover as more 
number  of  un-covered  sensor  nodes  as  possible  while  still 
overlap with the existing clusters, one at a time, until all the 
sensor nodes in V have been covered.   
There is another centralized algorithm for our clustering 
problem  which  uses  the  similar  greedy  approach,  but  with 
different way to handle the overlapping constraint. Instead of 
constructing  the  overlapping  clusters,  this  algorithm  first 
covers  all  the  nodes  in  V in  a  greedy  matter  without 
considering overlapping constraints, then it will test if all the 
clusters  are  connected  through  the  overlapping  nodes  and 
add extra clusters to connect them if necessary. To achieve 
this, we need to first identify all the isolated cluster groups 
(ICGs)  from  the  obtained  clusters.  Clusters  within  an  ICG 
are connected through overlapping nodes but do not overlap 
with  clusters  in  other  ICGs.  Then  extra  clusters  are 
established  to  connect  these  ICGs  (by  the  use  of  the 
minimum spanning tree (MST)).   
We  will  use  a  simple  example  to  demonstrate  the  two 
algorithms  above.  Fig.  6(a)  plots  the  topology  of  18  nodes 
deployed  on  the  same  substructure  of  the  structure  to  be 
monitored. A total of 7 clusters are obtained using the first 
algorithm  and  illustrated  in  Fig.  6(b).  Note  that  all  these  7 
clusters are single-hop clusters and are connected through the 
overlapping nodes. Using the second algorithm, a total of 6 
clusters  are  generated  after  all  the  18  nodes  have  been 
covered (see Fig. 7(a)). However, these 6 clusters constitute 
three ICGs illustrated in Fig. 7(b). By constructing the MST 
to connect these ICGs, two extra clusters (#7 and #8 in Fig. 
7(d)) are generated to connect these isolated clusters. 
For  the  second  algorithm,  we  have  the  following 
theorem: 
Theorem. If the optimal solution for the clustering problem 
has m clusters,  then  our  solution  will  produce  a  solution 
with at most   2m(ln|N|(cid:3397)1)(cid:3398)1 
greedy  algorithm  will  produce  at  most m(ln|N|(cid:3397)1) 
Proof:  It  has  been  shown  that  for  set  cover  problem,  the 
sets[4]. Our algorithm will need one additional step to make 
sure all the sets are connected through overlapping nodes. In 
the worst case when there is no overlapping node between 
any  pair  of  clusters,  we  will  need  at  most  additional 
m (ln|N|(cid:3397)1)(cid:3398)1  sets to connect them. Hence the total is 
2m(ln|N|(cid:3397)1)(cid:3398)1.
