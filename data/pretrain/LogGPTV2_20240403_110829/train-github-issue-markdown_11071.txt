Would it be possible to have a dependency against requests (Apache 2 licensed)
in Scrapy?
I noticed that it has superior proxy env handling, where urllib fails to parse
IPs or CIDR in a `$no_proxy` variable. This has led to failing testcases for
me and I'd like to fix it.
Also, requests provides a nice `compat` module, wrapping urllib/2 for PY2 and
PY3 differences.  
If not a dependency, could scrapy do this stuff similarly?  
Pulling in urllib/urllib2/urlparse from a local wrapper seems cleaner than
throwing `six.moves.` and `try...except` statements everywhere we use them.
And we have plenty of those imports.
