User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Good Free Tomcat Log Analyser? Could someone recommend a good and free program for analysing Apache Tomcat logs. I don't need real-time analysis or anything like that. I have a log and I just want a quick and easy way to get some usage statistics from it. The stats don't even have to be too fancy - I just want a rough idea of unique users per day, week, and month really.

Thanks,

Bart.

Assistant: You could use LambdaProbe :

It's a nice webapps that only require that you relaunch Java. It provides nice features like live thread listing, and also parses log file (catalina.out)
There is some nice monitoring (Session, threads, memory) and gives connector's load. At last (not least) it provides an interface to manage your webapps.
