**Subject: Good Free Tomcat Log Analyzer**

Hi Bart,

Thank you for your inquiry. I recommend using **LambdaProbe** for analyzing Apache Tomcat logs. It is a free and user-friendly web application that can provide the basic usage statistics you are looking for.

### Key Features of LambdaProbe:
- **Live Thread Listing:** Real-time monitoring of threads.
- **Log File Parsing:** Parses `catalina.out` log files to extract useful information.
- **Monitoring:** Provides insights into session, thread, and memory usage.
- **Connector Load:** Displays the load on connectors.
- **Web Application Management:** Offers an interface to manage your web applications.

To get started with LambdaProbe, you only need to relaunch Java. This tool will give you a clear overview of unique users per day, week, and month, which should meet your requirements for basic usage statistics.

You can find more information and download LambdaProbe from their official website: [LambdaProbe](http://www.lambdaprobe.org/d/index.htm)

I hope this helps!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
