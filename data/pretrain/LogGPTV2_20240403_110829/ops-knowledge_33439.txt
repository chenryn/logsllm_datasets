User: How to set a strong password policy to ensure the security of the company's internal network?
Assistant: Here are some suggestions for setting a strong password policy: 1. Require password strength: Passwords should include letters, numbers, and symbols, and be of sufficient length. 2. Mandatory password change: Require users to change their passwords on a regular basis, such as every three months. 3. Historical password rules: Prohibit users from using previously used passwords for a period of time. 4. Account lockout: After the user enters the wrong password many times, the account is locked. This prevents brute force attacks. 5. Captcha: Use captcha and two-factor authentication to make it impossible for malicious users to easily log in to the system. 6. Simulate Attacks: Test the effectiveness of password policies, and detect and patch vulnerabilities. 7. Notifications and Reminders: Remind users of the importance of their passwords and provide notifications when their passwords expire. 8. Education and training: Provide employee training on password rules and how to create secure passwords. 9. Use a password management tool: Using a password management tool is recommended so that users can store and manage their passwords securely.
