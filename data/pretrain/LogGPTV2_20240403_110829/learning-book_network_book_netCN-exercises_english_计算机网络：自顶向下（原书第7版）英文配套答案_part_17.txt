chunk is obtained by exclusive OR-ing the n original chunks. Second scheme: send a
lower-resolution low-bit rate scheme along with the original stream. Interleaving does
not increase the bandwidth requirements of a stream.
12. RTP streams in different sessions: different multicast addresses; RTP streams in the
same session: SSRC field; RTP packets are distinguished from RTCP packets by
using distinct port numbers.

13. The role of a SIP registrar is to keep track of the users and their corresponding IP
addresses which they are currently using. Each SIP registrar keeps track of the users
that belong to its domain. It also forwards INVITE messages (for users in its domain)
to the IP address which the user is currently using. In this regard, its role is similar to
that of an authoritative name server in DNS.

Problem 1
a) Client begins playout as soon as first block arrives at tl and video blocks are to be
played out over the fixed amount of time, d. So it follows that second video block
should be arrived before time tl + d to be played at right time, third block at
tl + 2d and so on. We can see from figure that only blocks numbered 1,4,5,6 arrive at
receiver before their playout times.
b) Client begins playout at time tl + d and video blocks are to be played out over the
fixed amount of time, d. So it follows that second video block should be arrived
before time tl +2d to be played at right time, third block at tl + 3d and so on. We can
see from figure that video blocks numbered from 1 to 6 except 7 arrive at receiver
before their playout times.
c)Maximum two video blocks are ever stored in the client buffer.Video blocks
numbered 3 and 4 arrive before tl + 3d and after tl + 2d, hence these two blocks are
stored in the client buffer. Video block numbered 5 arrives before time tl + 4d and
after t1 + 3d, which is stored in the client buffer along with already stored video block
numbered 4.
d)The smallest playout at the client should be tl + 3d to ensure that every block has
arrived in time.
Problem2
a) During a playout period, the buffer starts with Q bits and decreases at rate r - x. Thus,
after Q/(r - x) seconds after starting playback the buffer becomes empty. Thus, the
continuous playout period is Q/(r - x) seconds. Once the buffer becomes empty, it fills
at rate x for Q/x seconds, at which time it has Q bits and playback begins. Therefore,
the freezing period is Q/x seconds.
b)Time until buffer has Q bits is Q/x seconds. Time to add additional B - Q bits is (B -
Q)/(x - r) seconds. Thus the time until the application buffer becomes fullis  +
BQ
seconds.

Problem3
a)The server's average send rate is H/2
b)This part (b) is an odd question and will be removed from the next edition. After
playing out the first frame, because x(t)  Q, so that q(t) = Q by the end of
the first cycle for x(t). We have
Therefore, q (t) = Q when t = √2QT/H = tp.
d) At time t = T, q (t) = HT/2 = Q, so that playout begins. If subsequently there is no
freezing, we need q(t + T) > 0 for all t ≥ T, we have

a)Buffer grows at rate x  r. At time E, (x - r)*E bits are in buffer and are wasted.
b)Let S be the time when the server has transmitted the entire video. If S > E, buffer

Substituting this into the expression for cn gives
b)The delay estimate in part (a) is an average of the delays. It gives equal weight to
recent delays and to “old" delays. The delay estimate in Section 6.3 gives more
weight to recent delays; delays in the distant past have relatively little impact on the
estimate.
Problem 10
The two procedures are very similar. They both use the same formula, thereby resulting
in exponentially decreasing weights for past samples.
One difference is that for estimating average RTT, the time when the data is sent and
when the acknowledgement is received is recorded on the same machine. For the delay
estimate, the two values are recorded on different machines. Thus the sample delay can
actually be negative.
Problem 11
a)The delay of packet 2 is 7 slots. The delay of packet 3 is 9 slots. The delay of packet
4 is 8 slots. The delay of packet 5 is 7 slots. The delay of packet 6 is 9 slots. The
delay of packet 7 is 8 slots. The delay of packet 8 is > 8 slots.
b) Packets 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 will not be received in time for their playout if playout begins
at t-8.
c)Packets 3 and 6 will not be received in time for their playout if playout begins at t=9.
d) No packets will arrive after their playout time if playout time begins at t=10.

Problem 13
a)Both schemes require 25% more bandwidth. The first scheme has a playback delay of
5 packets. The second scheme has a delay of 2 packets.
b)The first scheme will be able to reconstruct the original high-quality audio encoding
The second scheme will use the low quality audio encoding for the lost packets and
will therefore have lower overall quality.
c)For the first scheme, many of the original packets will be lost and audio quality will
be very poor. For the second scheme, every audio chunk will be available at the
receiver, although only the low quality version will be available for every other
chunk. Audio quality will be acceptable
Problem14
a)Each of the other N - I participants sends a single audio stream of rate r bps to the
initiator. The initiator combines this stream with its own outgoing stream to create a
stream of rate r. It then sends a copy of the combined stream to each of the N -/ other
participants. The call initiator therefore sends at a total rate of (N-I)r bps, and the
q 7- s sued e ao p e e
b) As before, each of the other N - I participants sends a single video stream of rate r
bps to the initiator. But because the streams are now video, the initiator can no longer
combine them into a single stream. The initiator instead must send each stream it
receives to N - 2 participants. The call initiator therefore sends at a total rate of (V-
/)*(N-/)r bps, and the total rate aggregated over all participants is (N-/)r + (V-/)*(V
I)r = N (N-I) r bps.
c)N *(N-I)r bps
Problem15
a)As discussed in Chapter 2, UDP sockets are identified by the two-tuple consisting of
destination IP address and destination port number. So the two packets will indeed
pass through the same socket.
b) Yes, Alice only needs one socket. Bob and Claire will choose different SSRC's, so
Alice will be able distinguish between the two streams. Another question we could
have asked is: How does Alice’s software know which stream (i.e. SSRC) belongs to
Bob and which stream belongs to Alice? Indeed, Alice's software may want to
display the sender’s name when the sender is talking. Alice’s software gets the SSRC
to name mapping from the RTCP source description reports.
