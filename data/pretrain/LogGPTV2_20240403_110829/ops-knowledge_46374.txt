User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: I have chosen to install Python for Windows (64bit) not for all users, but just for me.
Reinstalling Python-x64 and checking the advanced option "for all users" solved the pip problem for me.
