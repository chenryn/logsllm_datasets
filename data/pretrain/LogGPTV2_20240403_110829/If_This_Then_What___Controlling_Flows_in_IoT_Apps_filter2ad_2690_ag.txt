Proof. By induction on the derivation ⟨c[i1/x], m1, S, Γ⟩pc →∗
⟨stop, m′
1, S1, Γ1⟩ and case analysis on the last rule used in that
derivation.
From Lemma B.2, S1 = S2 = S′, Γ1 = Γ2 = Γ′, and m′

Case assign. S′ = S and mi (outj ) = m′

S′(oj ) = ff .
Case seq. Follows from Lemma B.2 and IH.
Case if. We distinguish two cases:
(1) Γ(e) = L
Hence m1 (e) = m2 (e) and the same branch is taken in both execu-
tions. The result follows from IH.
(2) Γ(e) = H
Consider the more interesting case when the two executions follow
different branches of the conditional, e.g., c1 executes in m1 and c2
in m2.
From Lemma B.2 it follows that S′ = S. From Lemma B.3 it follows
that m′
i (outj )|B = mi (outj )|B = ∅ for i = 1, 2, and for all j such

that outj was redefined in either c1, or c2 and S′(oj ) = ff . Hence

that S′(oj ) = ff .
Case while. We distinguish two cases:
(1) Γ(e) = L
Hence m1 (e) = m2 (e) and the same branch is taken in both runs.
The result follows from IH.
(2) Γ(e) = H
Consider the more interesting case when c executes in m1 according
to rule while-true, and c executes in m2 according to rule while-
false.
From rule while-false it follows that m′
2 = m2. From Lemma B.3 it
follows that m′
1 (outj )|B = m1 (outj )|B = ∅ for all 1 ≤ j ≤ |S| such
that outj was redefined in c and S (oj ) = ff . Since m1 ∼B m2 for
all 1 ≤ j ≤ |S| such that S (oj ) = ff , it follows that m2 (outj )|B = ∅
for all 1 ≤ j ≤ |S| such that S (oj ) = ff .
Thus m′
Case sink. We distinguish two cases:
(1) Γ(e) = L
Hence m1 (e) = m2 (e) and m1 (e)|B = m2 (e)|B. Thus m′
(2) Γ(e) = H
We discuss the more interesting case when the sinkj statement
does not correspond to a skipped action, i.e. S (oj ) = ff .
From Lemma B.3 it follows that m′
i (outj )|B = ∅ for i = 1, 2. Hence
