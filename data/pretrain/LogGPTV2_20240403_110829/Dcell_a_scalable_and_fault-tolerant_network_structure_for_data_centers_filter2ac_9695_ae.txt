2 and tk  i > 0) link of src, src uses it to connect
to a DCelli−1. Note that all the nodes in this DCelli−1
need to go through this level-i link of src to reach src. The
number of nodes in this DCelli−1 is ti−1. Each node in
this DCelli−1 can use its level-i + 1 links to connect to a
DCelli. All the nodes in this DCelli also need to go through
the level-i link of src. The number of total nodes is then
ti−1 + ti−1ti = ti−1gi+1. All these nodes then use their i + 2
links to connect to a set of DCelli+1 DCells, to expand the
total number of nodes to ti−1gi+1gi+2. Similar procedures
can be sequentially carried out to the level i + 3, i + 4,
··· , k links. Consequently, we get σi = ti−1
