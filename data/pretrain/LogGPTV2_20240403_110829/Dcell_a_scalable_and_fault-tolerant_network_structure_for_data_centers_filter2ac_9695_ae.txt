#### Detailed Analysis for DCell

The DCell structure is recursively defined. For a DCell of level \( k \), the number of nodes \( t_k \) can be derived as follows:

\[
t_k = (t_{k-1})^2 + t_{k-1} = (t_{k-1} + 1)^2 - t_{k-1} - 1
\]

Similarly, we have:

\[
t_k = \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right)^{2k} - 1
\]

In a DCell, each node at level \( i \) has a link to a DCell of level \( i-1 \). All nodes in this DCell of level \( i-1 \) must go through this level-\( i \) link to reach the source node. The number of nodes in this DCell of level \( i-1 \) is \( t_{i-1} \).

Each node in this DCell of level \( i-1 \) can use its level-\( i+1 \) links to connect to a DCell of level \( i \). All nodes in this DCell of level \( i \) also need to go through the level-\( i \) link of the source node. The total number of nodes is then:

\[
t_{i-1} + t_{i-1} t_i = t_{i-1} g_{i+1}
\]

These nodes then use their level-\( i+2 \) links to connect to a set of DCells of level \( i+1 \), expanding the total number of nodes to \( t_{i-1} g_{i+1} g_{i+2} \). This process can be sequentially carried out for levels \( i+3, i+4, \ldots, k \). Consequently, we get:

\[
\sigma_i = t_{i-1} \prod_{j=i+1}^{k} g_j \quad \text{for} \quad k > i > 0
\]

This recursive definition and expansion allow DCell to efficiently scale and maintain high bisection bandwidth and low diameter.
