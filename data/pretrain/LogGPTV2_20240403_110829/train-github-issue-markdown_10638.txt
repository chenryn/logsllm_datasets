**Elasticsearch Version:** 2.3.5  
**JVM Version:** OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.6.7) (7u111-2.6.7-1~deb8u1)  
**Operating System Version:** Debian 8.5  

**Problem Description:**

**Expected Behavior:**
Log messages should be written to a single, designated location for ease of management and consistency.

**Actual Behavior:**
Log messages are currently being written to two locations:
1. `${path.logs}/${cluster.name}.log`
2. `stdout`

When using SystemD, the logs end up in two separate files: the Elasticsearch log file and the system's syslog. This duplication can lead to unnecessary complexity and redundancy in log management.

**Rationale:**
There does not appear to be a compelling reason to maintain both logging locations. The practice of writing logs to multiple destinations can complicate log analysis and maintenance. For more information, please refer to the "The Bad" section in this article: [SystemD Logging Tricks](http://www.kibinlabs.com/systemd-logging-tricks/).

**Suggested Solution:**
Consider configuring Elasticsearch to write logs to a single, unified location. This will streamline log management and improve the overall efficiency of your logging setup.
