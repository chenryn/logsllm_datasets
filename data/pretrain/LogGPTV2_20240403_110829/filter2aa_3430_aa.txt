Data Uncompromised
• Symmetric cryptosystem (shared secred key)
– The same key (the secret key) is used to encrypt and decrypt the message
– Examples: AES
• Asymmetric cryptosystem (public & private key)
– Use a public key to encrypt a message and a private key to decrypt it
– Examples: RSA, ECC

• Virtually all current cryptosystems are “computationally secure”
– Not decodable with available computing power, but no proof that you can’t 
break them
– To factor a 2048-bit RSA key, the best classical algorithm needs ~ 1034 steps and 
~317 trillion years on a classical ThZ Computer (with a trillion operations per 
second):
• There are information-theoretic cryptosystems (e.g. One-Time-Pad)
– However to enjoy the benefits of the proof, many assumptions must be met
• E.g. secret key is truly random. Secret key has the same length as the message, …

• Symmetric encryption (e.g. AES, 𝑁 = 256)
– Key can be recovered classically with a computational complexity of 𝑂 2𝑁
– Best quantum algorithm (Grover) provides “only” a squared speedup of 𝑂
2𝑁
– While this is still a massive speedup, doubling the keylength will compensate for 
this
• Asymmetric encryption (e.g. RSA, ECC)
– Used virtually everywhere to negotiate a symmetric key (e.g. VPN’s, TLS, Diffie-
Hellman, Digital Signatures, …)
– Multiple quantum algorithms available
– Focus for this talk

• Alice chooses two distinct prime numbers 𝑝, 𝑞 which are kept secret
• Key generation
– Compute 𝑛 = 𝑝𝑞
– Compute 𝜆 𝑛 = lcm(𝜆 𝑝 , 𝜆 𝑞 )
– Choose e such that 1 = 0

• Three phases
– Turn factoring problem into period finding
• computed on classical computer
– Find the period using Quantum Fourier Transform
• This is the part responsible for the quantum speedup
– Use the period to find the factors
