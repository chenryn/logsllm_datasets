Hi,
This might be duplicated question, but I have tried all possible research on
google and blogs to get a solution to fix it, so if you already know the
answer please help me.
I am trying to send an array of objects to Axios post request, but the payload
empty array even if I have the data in array as I checked with console.log
`axios.post("/api/videos", { ytVideosList, data: { customFunction:
"AddVideoList" } })`
where ytVideoList is [{json-obj1},{json-obj2}, .....] etc which is empty [] at
payload side, so i am not able to insert data in my database table. I hope
everything is clear if you know the answer please respond as soon as possible.
