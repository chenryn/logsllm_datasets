User: When my python program is killed with -9 normally it also closes the port it's listening.
BUT when it has some child processes running created with Popen (which I don't really need to kill on killing parent), while killing -9 the parent it seems to leave the port in use. 
How can I force to close the port even if there are children?
Assistant: ok I've got it seems like close_fds=True while doing Popen solves the issue.
