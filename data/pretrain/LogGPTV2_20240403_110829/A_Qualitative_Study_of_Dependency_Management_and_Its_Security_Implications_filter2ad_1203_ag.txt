### Interview and Analysis

#### Introduction
We attempted to conduct interviews with developers of popular GitHub projects. Unfortunately, we received only one response, which was insufficient for our study. According to B. Adams, the likely reason is that these developers are often overwhelmed by numerous research requests and may treat such emails as spam, especially if they contain attachments.

#### Code Frequency Distribution
Figure 2 shows the frequency distribution of codes attributed to interview fragments. Developers are concerned about issues such as security bugs introduced by dependencies. The top codes include:
- Dislike: 114 occurrences
- Security: 106 occurrences
- Bugs: 84 occurrences

The relatively low number of occurrences for "direct deps" (8 occurrences) and "transitive deps" (16 occurrences) suggests that developers do not consider all details of dependency management to be problematic. This is evident from the following quote:

> "If there‚Äôs something we really know to be broken, we fix it. Otherwise, it‚Äôs kind of left to itself." (#1)

Developers prefer to use dependencies as they are rather than diving into the source code. All interviewed developers discussed management (149 occurrences), while only 15 out of 25 touched on maintenance (24 occurrences).

#### Co-occurrence Analysis
To identify significant co-occurrences, we calculated the mean (ùúá = 8.27) and standard deviation (ùúé = 11.62) of code co-occurrences. Cells with values exceeding ùúá + ùúé (i.e., 19.89) were underlined. Columns where cell values do not exceed ùúá were excluded to reduce noise.

#### Language-Specific Analysis
Figures 3 and 4 show the complete co-occurrence table and the distribution of codes by language, respectively. These figures are available online at the provided links.

### Interview Transcript Example

**a. How do you deal with software dependencies in your projects?**
- I rely on tools like Maven or Gradle for Java and pip for Python. Sometimes, introducing a dependency can cause version conflicts, which can be tricky. For example, I had an issue with an XML parser in Java that caused memory leaks. I had to take a memory snapshot to identify the leak, which was caused by an external library.

**b. And how did you cope with that bug? What did you do?**
- We replaced the problematic library with another one that served the same purpose. This required some code rewrites but solved the memory leak problem in Tomcat.

**c. So you substituted the library?**
- Yes, we decided to change the library and took the opportunity to improve some of our code.

**d. Can you tell me a bit about your background?**
- I have five years of experience in .Net, three years in Java, and one and a half years in Python. I also worked with NodeJS using npm for JavaScript projects.

**e. And currently, you are working in a company, right?**
- Yes, I just started at a new company yesterday, and I am back to working with Java.

**f. And in the previous job?**
- In my previous job, I worked with Python and Django for backend development.

**g. What was the scope of the company?**
- It was a large corporate project aimed at implementing Industry 4.0 solutions. The project involved developing a web application to read data from sensors and other sources, and it had a global user base.

**h. How old was the project you were working on?**
- The project was started from scratch, but I also worked on established software with many dependencies.

**i. In both projects, they were Python projects, right?**
- The most recent project was in Python, but before that, I worked on a Java project where we introduced Maven for dependency management.

**j. How did you select the dependencies when you introduced Maven?**
- We started from scratch, compiling the software and adding dependencies one by one. It was a long and sometimes painful process, but necessary for continuous deployment and automated builds.

**k. Did you face situations where you had to select new dependencies for your project?**
- Yes, especially for new features. I usually check the reliability of open-source dependencies by looking at GitHub stars, commits, and contributors.

**l. How do you select them?**
- I check the reliability by looking at GitHub stars, commits, and contributors. If it's a paid library, I look for customer support and reviews.

**m. Why did you choose a private, commercial library?**
- In a Microsoft environment, there are fewer free alternatives for enterprise applications. Paid libraries offer more features and better support.

**n. What about vulnerabilities and bugs?**
- Vulnerabilities are rare, but bugs can occur. With paid libraries, there is support to submit and resolve issues.

**o. Do you need to apply patches for dependencies?**
- Yes, patches are usually minor releases and do not break the build.

**p. Do you face updates of libraries?**
- It depends on the company policy. Some companies update frequently, while others avoid updates unless necessary.

**q. Is there a correlation between the company's policy and the programming language?**
- Generally, larger corporations with Microsoft environments update less frequently, while smaller companies using open-source technologies update more often. However, this is not a strict rule.

**r. Do companies prefer to update libraries or keep them?**
- It depends on the company's resources and policies. Regular updates can save time in the long run, but they require resources.

**s. How often did you update dependencies?**
- In .Net, we updated main dependencies once a year. In smaller companies, updates are done as needed.

**t. What about the security side?**
- Security is a concern, but we trust well-known and widely used dependencies. We also look at the code to ensure it does not introduce vulnerabilities.

**u. Do companies check for security vulnerabilities?**
- Not always, but we try to use reliable sources and sometimes review the code.

**v. If there is no fix, what would be your reaction?**
- If it's an open-source library, we might complain to the maintainer. If it's a paid library, we might switch to another one or rewrite the affected code.
