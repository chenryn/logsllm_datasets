2.1 million units in 2014 to 5.9 million by 2019. Penetration will 
increase from 9.0% 2014 to 19.8% in 2019. Track & trace systems 
dominate the market and the installed base includes low-end 
systems with limited functionality. Once again, most fleet 
management systems use the 2G/3G/GPRS wireless networks, 
with satellite communication in unpopulated areas. The major 
fleet management suppliers are Chinese, including E6GPS 
and Etrans.  Some Chinese commercial vehicle OEMs have 
introduced telematics systems, notably Foton and Shaanxi 
Automobile Group. Automotive suppliers are expected to equip 
new commercial vehicles with telematics systems following 
government initiatives. 
With the predominance of GSM/GPRS communications set to 
increase with the move towards 3G and 4G, and the consequent 
improved service to end-users, Mobile Operators will be critical 
partners in the innovation, implementation and operation of fleet 
management services globally.
4.2 PAYDI & UBI
Pay As You Drive Insurance (PAYDI), also known as Usage-Based 
Insurance (UBI) is a hot topic, with increased interest in the US 
and Europe as insurance companies seek to reduce costs and to 
acquire more sophisticated tools to categorise drivers, especially 
with developments such as the EC ban on charging by the sex of 
the driver.  
Although the percentage of UBI policies is still small (8% in the 
US in mid-2014), it has doubled since early 2013. Drivers’ privacy 
concerns have also declined, from 42% to 35%, at least according 
to some reports, though others dispute this. Certainly there are 
concerns about the “dongles” used in these applications, and 
the extent to which they may compromise security and privacy. 
Dongles usually plug into the on-board diagnostics (OBD) port 
on a vehicle, and typically contain a processor and memory, a 
GPS receiver to determine location, an accelerometer to identify 
periods of harsh acceleration and braking, and a SIM card to relay 
data back to a control centre via a GPRS link. Thus dongles can 
provide valuable information to insurance companies and fleet 
managers, including: 
■■ Start and stop times and locations 
■■ Idling time
■■ Journey duration
■■ Roads used and mileage covered
■■ Use of seatbelt 
■■ Use of accelerator and brakes
■■  Time, direction and severity of impact 
■■ Driver and number of passengers, if camera is 
installed in vehicle
It appears that 80% of smartphone owners are willing to 
download apps to their phones that would track their driving. 
In the US in 2014 the Allstate insurance company began testing 
a smartphone app called Drivewise Mobile, which is available in 
19 states and Washington, D.C. The UK Automobile Association 
also has a free-to-download usage-based insurance app for 
smartphone users. This is important because dongles are 
relatively expensive. The Progressive insurance company, based 
in Ohio, announced that it was comparing results of the mobile 
app with data from its “Snapshot” device in the same car.

Android and iPhone smartphone apps can cut up-front costs, 
tracking driver habits such as mileage and braking in exchange 
for reduced policy costs. Google and Apple also have other 
advantages, including being accepted as big data collectors. 
Apple’s “CarPlay” allows iPhone users to make calls, use Apple 
Maps, listen to music and access messages by touch or voice 
commands. The iPhone is connected to the car through a cable, 
and CarPlay can then be controlled from the car’s built-in display 
or by using Siri, Apple’s iOS voice system. Google has introduced 
the similar Android Auto. Vehicle manufacturers including Audi, 
Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, Chevrolet, Mazda 
and Volvo have said they will support both CarPlay and Android 
Auto. 
In early 2015 AT&T and LoJack Corporation, a leader in vehicle 
theft recovery and advanced fleet management solutions, 
announced a collaboration to power LoJack’s current and 
future telematics solutions. Both companies are committed 
to providing machine-to-machine and telematics solutions to 
the automotive and fleet industries, giving better operational 
efficiency, improved customer service and increased 
profitability. 
4.3   Parking
Parking objectives, principles and practice
Studies have shown that a large percentage of urban traffic (from 
8% to 74% at different times and places) may be drivers cruising 
around looking for a parking space. Facilitating their task – and 
tailoring the parking charge appropriately, will help to minimise 
congestion and pollution. The price should be set so that one or 
two curb spaces are usually vacant on every block so that drivers 
can always find convenient parking, but with 85% of spaces 
occupied all the time. Prices can be variable, with new rates 
sent wirelessly to meters. Public acceptability is increased if the 
revenue is spent on local infrastructure (Shoup 2011). According 
to Cisco (2013), the field of “smart parking” is valued at $41 billion 
worldwide. 
Westminster, London
In 2013/14 Westminster City Council installed more than 
3,000 parking bay sensors which detect whether a bay is 
vacant; drivers can use a smartphone app to view a real-
time map of parking spaces, updated every minute, showing 
where there are empty bays, and directing to the nearest 
one. This award-winning “ParkRight” app will reduce the time 
spent driving around looking for a parking space and the 
congestion on Westminster’s roads. The scheme is attracting 
world-wide attention. Installation of a further 7000 sensors 
will be considered in 2015. The number of PaybyPhone (PbP) 
transactions increased by 4.7% in 2013/14, to 669,343, whereas 
the number of transactions for card-only Pay and Display 
parking remained constant (Westminster (2014).

5  Road Pricing
Road Pricing incorporates Tolling, Road User Charging, Congestion 
Charging, Electronic Fee Collection (the EC term) and Value Pricing 
(in the US). This is an important topic in the ITS area. 
5.1 City congestion charging
The existing city congestion charge schemes use either 
microwave DSRC technology (Singapore), or cameras plus 
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) (London, 
Stockholm, Gothenburg).  
Although probably not connected to Singapore’s road pricing 
plans, it is worth noting that Singtel and Ericsson announced 
in January 2015 a partnership to explore the future of 5G 
communications in Singapore, including the Internet of Things 
and “cloud-based computing”.
‘The potential for benefits from a well-designed, large-scale 
road pricing scheme is unrivalled by any other intervention’1 
- though commercially progress has been slow, because of fears 
of public and political unacceptability, road pricing appears to 
be acceptable if it is equitable, revenue-neutral and efficient. 
Dramatic traffic reduction is achieved with minimal charges, 
without diversion onto other routes. Satellite technology with 
mobile communications allows charging by Time, Distance and 
Place. Germany and Slovakia use GPS/GSM-based truck-tolling 
schemes, as will Belgium (T-Systems & Belgacom) and Bulgaria. 
Singapore will migrate to GSM/GPS for all vehicles by 2020. In 
the US Oregon is trialing road pricing as a ”gas tax” replacement, 
with one option using a smartphone. Verizon is involved in the 
trial through insurance company State Farm. California and other 
western states are closely following the trials. Other countries 
also have declining revenue from motor (especially fuel) taxes. 
Mobile operators are used to keeping large volumes of sensitive 
data secure, so are ideally placed to play a role in road pricing; 
whether city-based or over wider areas, including across multiple 
boarders.
Slovakia
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) / GSM-based charging has been used in Slovakia since January 2010, for lorries of over 
3.5 tonnes on 600 km of motorways and 1,800 km of first class roads. The objectives are to finance the operation of the motorway 
network, and to charge ‘through-traffic’. A quarter of a million OBU dongles have been issued; a GNSS/GSM OBU is mandatory for 
all trucks. 
The Slovakian system claims to be the first based only on GNSS, for all major roads, and was relatively cost-effective to implement, 
taking only 11 months to build up the 2,400km toll network. Updates of the “geomodel” of the road and zone network are performed 
over the air using secure GPRS data communication, allowing new roads and other infrastructure to be incorporated quickly and 
easily. The ease of extending a GNSS/CN scheme is likely to influence other potential adopters and upgraders.

6 Public Transport
Public transport works well in high-density urban environments, 
but less so in rural or suburban environments. Nonetheless, public 
transport is crucially important, especially in urban and suburban 
areas as the world-wide trend is towards increasing urbanisation.  
Car-pooling and dynamic ride-sharing, encouraged by mobile 
technology, reduce congestion and pollution, and commuter 
costs.  Zipcar (Avis) claims to be the world’s leading car sharing 
club, based in North America and Europe. DriveNow (BMW/
Sixt) operates in Europe and San Francisco. Some companies, 
including Uber (Google) and Lyft, have turned dynamic ride-
sharing into a successful business. Car-pooling, car clubs and 
dynamic ridesharing rely on mobile technology, and their use will 
increase.
Cycling is increasingly used for short journeys in cities. Customers 
of cycle-hire schemes use smart-phones to check availability, 
locate, pay for and unlock bikes, .  The Dutch VANMOOF 
company has GPS connectivity and Vodafone M2M SIMs in its 
e-bike to combat theft and to map commuter routes. 
Public bodies are making transport data available for app 
developers, increasing transport efficiency. Benefits of smart-
phone Near Field Communication (NFC) include passenger 
convenience, lower sales and distribution costs, more flexibility, 
personalised communication with passengers and promotion 
of public transport. For the consumer, mobile technology allows 
travel time to be used productively and mobile ticketing will triple 
between 2013 and 2018.
A journey may include more than one mode of transport. 
Research identifies four areas that can make public transport 
easier and more convenient (DfT 2014): 
■■ Improving the quality and availability of 
information; 
■■ Smart and integrated ticketing; 
■■ Improved and reliable connections in multi-modal 
journeys; 
■■ Safe, comfortable and easily accessible transport 
facilities, meeting the needs of passengers.
■■ An important part of this is making data available 
for app and other developers;  
see www.data.gov.uk
Travel information and Traffic management

7  Travel information and  
  Traffic management
Traffic and traveler information play an increasingly part in traffic 
management, and empower passengers.  Car drivers will switch to 
transit if they can manage their commutes through smartphone apps 
with real-time information on schedules and delays.  
Apps are cheaper than electronic displays at bus-stops. So 
mobile technology and social media can improve the passenger 
experience and benefit the transport operator and the MNO. The 
annual “App Quest” competition of New York State’s Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority (MTA) uses real-time data sets and 
APIs, with $50,000 prize money from AT&T. 
Road traffic information supplied by mobile technology: The 
Singapore Land Transport Authority use drivers’ smart-phones 
as traffic sensors and to deliver personalised real-time traffic 
information. The Waze (Google) app generates traffic, mapping 
and other road data in back-ground mode, and reports on traffic 
disruptions or fuel prices. Social media, especially Twitter and 
crowd-sourcing, are important sources of transport information 
and control. 90% of US States use Twitter and Facebook to 
publicise traffic incidents, construction projects and safety 
initiatives; 50% offer mobile apps and 73% have mobile-friendly 
web sites. 
7.1 Social Media in Transport
In 2013 there were 680 million active monthly mobile users of 
Facebook, 120million users of Twitter and 46 million users of 
LinkedIn (GSMA 2013b).  These and other social media, especially 
twitter and crowd-sourcing, have become an increasingly 
important source of transport information and even of control. 
People may learn about a road traffic accident or transport 
problems through twitter before they hear about it from their 
traffic information service; for example, Transport for London 
asks people to follow @TfLTrafficNews to get live travel news 
and avoid disruption.  Car-sharing has been found to be more 
acceptable with “Facebook Friends” than it is with strangers.
Social media allow transport users to communicate and share 
intelligence with each other as distinct from the traditional 
relationship of communication between transport system 
providers and end users, as we have seen above.

8  Conclusions
ITS is a complex subject, but the transportation solutions being 
developed under this banner have the ability to transform our daily 
lives. 
From the effective and profitable running of a transport operators 
business or the efficient operation of a city right the way through 
to an enhanced customer experience or the increased safety of 
an individual citizen. 
ITS solutions clearly offer many benefits, but establishing the 
correct ecosystem to deliver these solutions is critical. In many 
cases Policy makers will play a large role in defining not only how 
services are delivered but how interoperable and collaborative 
these services are. In order to create transformational ITS 
solutions and inform supportive policy choices it is important 
that the ecosystem partners start to collaborate. The GSMA 
believe that mobile operators have an important role to play in 
the generation of ITS and would encourage the ITS ecosystem to 
engage with their local mobile operators.
