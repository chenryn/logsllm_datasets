### 2.1 Market Growth and Penetration
From 2014 to 2019, the number of fleet management units increased from 2.1 million to 5.9 million, with market penetration rising from 9.0% to 19.8%. Track and trace systems dominate the market, with many installations comprising low-end systems with limited functionality. Most fleet management systems utilize 2G/3G/GPRS wireless networks, with satellite communication in remote areas. Major suppliers in China include E6GPS and Etrans. Some Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturers, such as Foton and Shaanxi Automobile Group, have introduced telematics systems. It is expected that automotive suppliers will equip new commercial vehicles with telematics systems in response to government initiatives.

With the transition towards 3G and 4G, GSM/GPRS communications are set to become more prevalent, enhancing service quality for end-users. Mobile operators will play a crucial role in the innovation, implementation, and operation of global fleet management services.

### 4.2 Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance (PAYDI) and Usage-Based Insurance (UBI)
Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance (PAYDI), also known as Usage-Based Insurance (UBI), is a growing trend, particularly in the US and Europe, as insurance companies aim to reduce costs and better categorize drivers. This shift is partly driven by regulations such as the EC ban on charging different rates based on gender.

Although UBI policies still represent a small percentage (8% in the US as of mid-2014), this figure has doubled since early 2013. Concerns about driver privacy have decreased from 42% to 35%, according to some reports, although this is disputed. The use of "dongles" in UBI applications, which plug into the OBD port of a vehicle, has raised security and privacy concerns. These devices typically include a processor, memory, GPS receiver, accelerometer, and SIM card to relay data via GPRS. They can provide valuable information to insurance companies and fleet managers, including:
- Start and stop times and locations
- Idling time
- Journey duration
- Roads used and mileage covered
- Seatbelt usage
- Accelerator and brake usage
- Time, direction, and severity of impact
- Driver and number of passengers (if a camera is installed)

Approximately 80% of smartphone owners are willing to download driving-tracking apps. In 2014, Allstate began testing Drivewise Mobile, an app available in 19 states and Washington, D.C. The UK Automobile Association also offers a free UBI app for smartphones. This is significant because dongles can be relatively expensive. Progressive Insurance is comparing data from its mobile app with data from its "Snapshot" device in the same car.

Android and iPhone apps can reduce upfront costs by tracking driver habits in exchange for lower policy premiums. Google and Apple, recognized as big data collectors, offer additional advantages. Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto allow users to make calls, use maps, listen to music, and access messages through their smartphones. Several vehicle manufacturers, including Audi, Honda, Nissan, Subaru, Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, Chevrolet, Mazda, and Volvo, support both CarPlay and Android Auto.

In early 2015, AT&T and LoJack Corporation announced a collaboration to power LoJack’s current and future telematics solutions, aiming to improve operational efficiency, customer service, and profitability in the automotive and fleet industries.

### 4.3 Parking
Parking studies show that a significant portion of urban traffic (ranging from 8% to 74%) consists of drivers searching for parking spaces. Facilitating parking and setting appropriate charges can help minimize congestion and pollution. The ideal scenario is to have one or two curb spaces vacant on every block, with 85% occupancy overall. Prices can be adjusted dynamically and sent wirelessly to meters. Public acceptance increases if revenue is used for local infrastructure improvements.

In 2013/14, Westminster City Council in London installed over 3,000 parking bay sensors, allowing drivers to use a smartphone app to view real-time parking availability. The award-winning "ParkRight" app reduces the time spent searching for parking and decreases congestion. The scheme has attracted global attention, and the council is considering installing an additional 7,000 sensors in 2015. The number of PaybyPhone transactions increased by 4.7% in 2013/14, while card-only Pay and Display parking remained constant.

### 5. Road Pricing
Road pricing encompasses tolling, road user charging, congestion charging, electronic fee collection, and value pricing. Existing city congestion charge schemes use either microwave DSRC technology (Singapore) or cameras with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) (London, Stockholm, Gothenburg).

Despite not being directly related to Singapore's road pricing plans, Singtel and Ericsson announced a partnership in January 2015 to explore 5G communications, including the Internet of Things and cloud-based computing.

A well-designed, large-scale road pricing scheme can achieve significant benefits, but progress has been slow due to public and political unacceptability. However, it is generally accepted if it is equitable, revenue-neutral, and efficient. Satellite and mobile communications enable charging by time, distance, and location. Germany and Slovakia use GPS/GSM-based truck-tolling schemes, and other countries, including Belgium and Bulgaria, plan to adopt similar systems. Singapore aims to migrate to GSM/GPS for all vehicles by 2020. In the US, Oregon is trialing road pricing as a "gas tax" replacement, with options using smartphones. California and other western states are closely following these trials.

Mobile operators, experienced in handling large volumes of sensitive data, are well-positioned to play a key role in road pricing, whether in cities or across wider areas, including multiple borders.

### 6. Public Transport
Public transport is most effective in high-density urban environments but less so in rural or suburban areas. However, it remains crucial, especially as urbanization trends continue. Carpooling and dynamic ride-sharing, facilitated by mobile technology, reduce congestion, pollution, and commuter costs. Companies like Zipcar, DriveNow, Uber, and Lyft have turned dynamic ride-sharing into successful businesses. Cycling is increasingly popular for short journeys, with smart-phones used to check bike availability, locate, pay for, and unlock bikes.

Public bodies are making transport data available to app developers, improving transport efficiency. Benefits of smartphone Near Field Communication (NFC) include passenger convenience, lower sales and distribution costs, more flexibility, personalized communication, and promotion of public transport. Mobile technology allows travel time to be used productively, and mobile ticketing is expected to triple between 2013 and 2018.

A journey may involve multiple modes of transport. Research identifies four key areas to improve public transport:
- Enhancing the quality and availability of information
- Smart and integrated ticketing
- Improved and reliable connections in multi-modal journeys
- Safe, comfortable, and accessible transport facilities

### 7. Travel Information and Traffic Management
Traffic and traveler information play a vital role in traffic management and empower passengers. Real-time information through smartphone apps can encourage car drivers to switch to public transit. Apps are more cost-effective than electronic displays at bus stops and can enhance the passenger experience, benefiting both the transport operator and the mobile network operator.

The annual "App Quest" competition of New York State’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) uses real-time data sets and APIs, with $50,000 in prize money from AT&T. The Singapore Land Transport Authority uses drivers' smartphones as traffic sensors to deliver personalized real-time traffic information. The Waze app generates traffic, mapping, and other road data, and reports on traffic disruptions and fuel prices. Social media, especially Twitter and crowd-sourcing, are important sources of transport information and control. Ninety percent of US states use Twitter and Facebook to publicize traffic incidents, construction projects, and safety initiatives; 50% offer mobile apps, and 73% have mobile-friendly websites.

### 7.1 Social Media in Transport
In 2013, there were 680 million active monthly mobile users of Facebook, 120 million users of Twitter, and 46 million users of LinkedIn. These platforms, especially Twitter and crowd-sourcing, have become essential sources of transport information and control. For example, Transport for London encourages people to follow @TfLTrafficNews for live travel news. Car-sharing is more acceptable among "Facebook Friends" than with strangers.

Social media allow transport users to communicate and share information, differing from the traditional relationship between transport providers and end-users.

### 8. Conclusions
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are complex but have the potential to transform daily life. From the efficient operation of transport businesses and cities to enhanced customer experiences and increased safety, ITS solutions offer numerous benefits. Establishing the correct ecosystem to deliver these solutions is critical, with policymakers playing a significant role in defining service delivery, interoperability, and collaboration. The GSMA believes that mobile operators have an important role in generating ITS and encourages the ITS ecosystem to engage with local mobile operators.
