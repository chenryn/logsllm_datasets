While attempting to create a blog using Pelican, I encountered some errors during the `make serve` step. After researching online, it appears that this might be a web-related issue, but I haven't found a clear solution yet. Could anyone provide some guidance? I am running Ubuntu with Python 2.7. Thank you in advance.

**Python Information:**
```
Python 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2
```

**Response:**

I experienced a similar issue when setting up Pelican with a Python 3 and pip3 installation, which is now recommended. The problem seemed to be related to permissions. To resolve it, I simply ran the command `pelican --listen` with superuser rights, which allowed the local server to function correctly.

Additionally, ensure that all packages are installed with `sudo` to avoid permission issues. For example:

```bash
sudo pip3 install pelican
```

This should help you get a fully functional setup.
