User: I was trying to make a blog with pelican, and in the step of make serve I had below errors. By searching online it looks like a web issue ( I'm not familiar with these at all ) and I didn't see a clear solution. Could anyone shed some light on? I was running on Ubuntu with Python 2.7. Thanks!
Python info:

Python 2.7.6 (default, Jun 22 2015, 17:58:13) [GCC 4.8.2] on linux2

Assistant: I can report that :

I encountered the same problem with a python3 / pip3 installation (which is recommended now) 
the problem was apparently with the permissions on python. I simply had to run pelican --listen with superuser rights to make the local server work.

Also be careful to install all packets you might have installed without superuser rights with sudo in order to have a fully-working installation with sudo.
