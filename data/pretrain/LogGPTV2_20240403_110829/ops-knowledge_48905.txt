User: Analyze the possible fault causes of the following phenomena, and give a solution. The Dockerfile build image is abnormal. How to troubleshoot?
Assistant: Dockerfile is a layer-by-layer image build process, during which one or more temporary containers will be generated. During the construction process, the application is actually installed in the temporary container. It was cleaned up, but the intermediate image built during the period is still there, so we can run the temporary image as a container based on the temporary image built on the previous layer when the exception occurs, and then run the installation command in the container to locate the specific exception.
