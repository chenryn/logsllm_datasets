APPENDIX
Figure 3 shows the distribution of unwanted APKs per
device, for devices with at least one encounter. The median is
2.0, the average 5.0, and the standard deviation 1497.0. The
y-axis is logarithmic and the x-axis s cut at x=100.
Table XI shows the summary of app distribution for all 1.7B
installation events for which we could identify an installation
vector, independent of the availability of parent information
(i.e., installer hash and installer signer). The changes in the
VDR column, compared to Table VII, shows minimal changes.
The largest change is in the VDR value of the alternative
markets that increases by 0.7% and the unclassiﬁed apps vector
by 0.7%. The rest are increased at most by 0.3%.
