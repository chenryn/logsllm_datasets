Abstract — Fault tolerance in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) 
has  been  studied  extensively  by  computer  science  researchers 
and  they  proposed  many  fault-tolerant  schemes  for  various 
applications  including  target  and  event  detection.  However, 
these schemes would fail in a particular application of WSNs: 
structural  health  monitoring  (SHM).  Different  from  other 
applications  of  WSNs,  detecting  structural  damage  requires 
significant  amount  of  civil  domain  knowledge  and  utilizes 
different  detection  model.  Meanwhile,  researchers  in  civil 
engineering also proposed some fault-tolerant SHM algorithms. 
However,  these  algorithms  are  all  centralized  and  not 
applicable to resource-limited wireless sensor networks. To our 
best  knowledge,  we  are  the  first  to  address  fault  tolerance 
problem in WSN-based SHM. We target faulty sensor reading, 
one  of  the  most  difficult  types  of  sensor  fault  to  be  detected, 
and  propose  a  fault-tolerant  SHM  approach.  The  proposed 
approach  is  lightweight  and  it  is  able  to  disambiguate 
structural damage from sensor faults. The effectiveness of the 
proposed  approach  is  demonstrated  through  both  simulation 
and real implementation.

  INTRODUCTION

applications 
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), due to the advantage 
of low-cost and easy deployment, have been widely used in 
many  monitoring 
battlefield 
surveillance,  environmental  monitoring  and  biological 
detection  [1-2],  etc.  However,  when  a  large  number  of 
low-cost  wireless  sensor  nodes  are  deployed  under  harsh 
environment  for  a  long  period  of  time,  many  sensor  nodes 
are  likely  to  exhibit  unreliable  behavior.  It  is  important  to 
guarantee  that  the  overall  functionality  of  the  WSNs  is 
tolerant 
sensor  nodes.  This 
fault-tolerance  problem  remains  to  be  one  of  the  important 
issues  in  WSNs  and  have  been  studied  extensively  by 
researchers 
in  computer  science  engineering.  Through 
abstraction 
they  proposed  many 
and 
fault-tolerant schemes [3-5] and they have been successfully 
applied to various monitoring applications. However, we will 
show  that  these  fault-tolerant  schemes  would  fail  in  a 
particular application of WSNs: structural health monitoring 
(SHM).   
assumptions, 
individual 
The  objective  of  SHM  is  to  monitor  the  integrity  of 
structures  and  detect  and  pinpoint  the  locations  of  any 
possible  damage.  In  a  typical  SHM  system,  an  array  of 
sensors, usually accelerometers or strain gauges are deployed 
on a structure to periodically collect its responses to ambient 
or forced excitation. These measurements are aggregated in a 
centralized server where a SHM algorithm is carried out to 
extract  damage-sensitive  vibration  characteristics.  From 
these  vibration  characteristics,  structural  damage  can  be 
detected and located [6]. 
It can be seen that detection of structural damage is not as 
straightforward as in other applications: In traditional event 
and target detection, each sensor node detects events/targets 
by  comparing  the  received  energy,  in  terms  of  light, 
vibration, temperature, etc, emitted by events or targets to a 
threshold. While in SHM, detection of event (i.e. structural 
damage)  is  through  vibration  characteristics.  To  accurately 
identify  vibration  characteristics,  SHM  algorithms  work  on 
the  raw  measured  data  of  multiple  sensor  nodes,  and  the 
measured data from each sensor node involved is no longer a 
single  value  but  a  sequence  of  data  with  length  generally 
more than one thousand.   
As  was  in  other  WSN  applications,  various  types  of 
faults can occur on the wireless sensor nodes deployed in a 
SHM  system.  Besides  some  easily  identified  faults  such  as 
battery  depletion,  transceiver  failure,  etc,  we  are  more 
interested in a type of fault which is quite common but much 
more  difficult  to  be  detected:  faulty  sensor  reading.  Sensor 
nodes with this fault seem to work properly, but the values 
returned  by  them  are  incorrect.  A  very  common  reason  of 
this fault is that sensor nodes partially or completely debond 
from host structure [7]. Sensor degradation or breakage also 
can cause faulty reading. Since this type of fault cannot be 
easily identified, its can directly affect the damage detection 
importantly,  previous 
capability  of 
fault-tolerance  schemes 
this  faulty  reading 
problem, such as decision fusion [3] and value fusion [8], are 
not able to function in SHM as before. The decision fusion 
assumes that individual sensor nodes, if healthy, are able to 
give reliable result about the occurrence of event if the event 
is within its coverage area; while the value fusion is based on 
the assumption that the data amount of each sensor node is 
small.  These  assumptions  are  not  valid  in  SHM  because 
SHM uses a totally different approach to detect damage. This 
point will be described in detail in the next section.

these 
algorithms assume the structure itself is healthy and are not 
able to disambiguate faulty sensors from structural damage.

algorithm is majority voting: if most neighbour nodes have 
the same value as its particular value, a node considers that 
its sensor is correct. This scheme is illustrated in Fig.2 (a), 
where sensor node S0 receives the local conclusions from its 
neighbours (S1~S6) to confirm whether its own conclusion is 
correct.  This  scheme  is  further  improved  in  [12]  by  using 
only  part  of  neighbour  nodes  in  fusion  so  as  to  further 
decrease the energy consumption and traffic congestion. This 
scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2(b), where S0 only receives part 
of  its  neighbours,  particularly,  S1,  S3  and  S5,  to  make

characteristics,  natural  frequencies  and  mode  shapes,  are 
adopted  at  each  layer.  In  this  approach,  sensor  nodes 
deployed  on  a  structure  is  partitioned  into  clusters  and 
detection  of  faulty  sensor  nodes  is  implemented  in  each 
cluster. In the first layer, faulty sensor nodes are detected by 
natural  frequencies.  This  is  based  on  the  premise  that  the 
natural frequencies identified from normal sensor nodes are 
similar in the same cluster but different from those obtained 
from faulty nodes. After faulty nodes have been detected, a 
second layer uses mode shapes to detect possible structural 
damage.  This  approach  is  lightweight  and  is  able  to 
disambiguate  structural  damage  from  faults  in  the  sensor 
readings.  The  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  approach  is

II.  RELATED WORK 
Fault tolerance of WSNs, particularly in the presence of 
some  sensor  nodes  with  faulty  readings,  has  been  studied 
extensively by researchers in computer science engineering. 
The  application  background  is  mainly  event  or  target 
detection  in  battlefield  surveillance,  habitat  monitoring,  or 
environment monitoring etc. The main objective is that when 
some sensor nodes give faulty readings, how to still achieve 
the correct detection of events/targets over a specific region. 
  A  widely  adopted  fault-tolerant  strategy  is  decision 
fusion. Fig. 1 shows the basic theory of decision fusion[3]. If 
event or target H occurs or appears, each sensor (Si) observes 
it  via  signal  yi  and  makes  a  local  decision  ui  which  is 
typically,  a binary  value.    The local decisions are sent to a 
fusion  center,  where  the  final  decision  u0  is  made  by 
combining these local decisions. It is assumed the occurrence 
of  event  will  be  detected  by  more  than  one  sensor  nodes. 
This  spatial  redundancy  is  utilized  in  the  fusion  algorithm. 
Optimal fusion algorithms have been sought under different 
criterion.   
Figure 1 Fault-tolerant decision fusion strategy (from [3]) 
To make the above strategy more applicable for wireless 
sensor  networks, a distributed  version  was  proposed  in  [5]. 
In  this  algorithm,  each  sensor  node  communicates  with  its 
neighbours  and  collects 
their  binary  decisions  and 
Figure 2    Decision fusion scheme in WSNs (from [5] and [12]) 
The fault-tolerant methods proposed above use decision 
fusion.  Another  kind  of  fusion  which  can  make  the  system 
tolerant  to  faulty  reading  is  value  fusion[8].  Different  from 
decision  fusion,  sensors  in  value  fusion  exchange  their 
measured values first and then make their decisions (see Fig. 
3).  Through  simulation,  it  is  concluded  in  [8]  that  value 
fusion is superior to decision fusion when the sensor network 
is  highly  reliable.  However,  as  more  faulty  sensors  are 
introduced  in  the  system,  decision  fusion  performs  better 
than value fusion.   
Figure 3 Value fusion, the grey sensors are faulty (from [8])   
Although  the  proposed  fusion  schemes  have  been 
successfully  applied  for  many  WSN  applications,  they  are 
not  suitable  for  one  particular  monitoring  application, 
structural health monitoring.   
Detection of event in SHM (i.e. structural damage) uses 
different  approach  from  most  of  the  existing  monitoring 
applications  of  WSNs.  To  detect  structural  damage,  the 
vibration characteristics of structures are first identified from 
measured vibration data and damage is then detected based 
on  examining  these  characteristics.  Thus  the  accuracy  of 
these  identified  characteristics  becomes  critical  for  damage 
detection. An important property of SHM is that the accurate 
identification  of  vibration  characteristics  always  requires 
data-level  collaboration  of  multiple  sensor  nodes[13-14].

multiple  sensor  nodes  are  processed  simultaneously, 
generally through various matrix computations such as eigen 
decomposition, 
etc.   
Structural damage cannot be reliably detected by individual 
sensor node, even the sensor itself is not faulty.

value 
For the decision fusion in Fig. 1, faulty sensor nodes are 
detected  in  the process of event detection:  if  a  sensor  node 
gives different decision about the occurrence of event from 
others,  it  is  regarded  as  faulty.  This  approach  is  valid  for 
many  event  and  target  detection  applications  since  each 
healthy  sensor  node  can  make  correct  local  decision  by 
comparing the received energy emitted by events/targets to a 
threshold. While in SHM, since individual sensor node is not 
able to detect damage, even the sensor itself is not faulty, the 
decision fusion scheme is no longer applicable for SHM.   
The  value  fusion  scheme  in  Fig.  3(a)  is  also  not 
applicable to SHM.    In the existing WSNs applications such 
as target tracking or event detection, sensed data from each 
node can be simple as a single or a few byte data. While in 
SHM, to identify vibration characteristics, sensor nodes need 
to  sample  at  hundreds  of  Hz  and  the  data  length  required 
from  each  sensor  node  is  generally  much  larger  than  one 
thousand. Exchanging the raw data among the sensor nodes 
is  not  applicable  considering  the  possible  communication 
cost, energy consumption in wireless sensor network.

isolating 
It also  should be  noted  that  the  above  value  fusion  and 
decision  fusion  are able  to  mask  the  effect of  faulty  sensor 
nodes.  In  other  words,  the  event  can  still  be  correctly 
detected  without 
faulty  sensor  nodes.   
However  in  SHM,  damage  detection  always  relies  on  the 
data-level  collaboration  of  multiple  sensor  nodes.  This 
property  of  SHM  algorithms 
the 
measurements  from  faulty  sensor  nodes  are  involved,  their 
effect is almost impossible to be masked or controlled. These 
data  will  contaminate  the  accuracy  of  identified  vibration 
characteristics.  It  is  therefore  necessary  to  first  identify  the 
faulty sensor nodes and then detect damage using data from 
the remaining sensor nodes.

There  is  also  some  previous  work  in  civil  engineering 
community to detect sensors which give faulty readings. In 
[9],  two  approaches  were  proposed  which  based  on  the 
comparison  between  the  subspace  of  response  and  the 
subspace  generated  by  the  lower  modes  of  a  structural 
model. In [10], the detection of sensor failures relies on an 
auto-associative  neural  network  which

implement  principle  component  analysis  (PCA).  Another 
procedure based on PCA was proposed in [11] which is able 
to perform detection, isolation and reconstruction of a faulty 
sensor. However, these approaches assume that the structure 
is  healthy  when  implementing  sensor  fault  detection.  They 
are  not  able  to  discriminate  between  sensor  fault  and 
structural  damage.  In  addition,  they  are  all  centralized  and 
need the raw measurement data from all the sensor nodes to 
be aggregated to a central unit. Implementing neural network
