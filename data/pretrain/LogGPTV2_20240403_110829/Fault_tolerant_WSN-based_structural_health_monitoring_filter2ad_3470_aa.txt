## Abstract
Fault tolerance in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has been extensively studied by computer science researchers, who have proposed numerous fault-tolerant schemes for various applications, including target and event detection. However, these schemes are not suitable for a specific application: structural health monitoring (SHM). Unlike other WSN applications, SHM requires significant civil engineering domain knowledge and uses different detection models. Meanwhile, civil engineering researchers have proposed some fault-tolerant SHM algorithms, but these are centralized and not applicable to resource-limited WSNs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the fault tolerance problem in WSN-based SHM. We focus on faulty sensor readings, one of the most challenging types of sensor faults to detect, and propose a lightweight, fault-tolerant SHM approach. This approach can distinguish between structural damage and sensor faults. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through both simulation and real implementation.

## I. Introduction
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have gained widespread use in various monitoring applications due to their low cost and ease of deployment. These include battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring, and biological detection. However, when a large number of low-cost wireless sensor nodes are deployed in harsh environments over extended periods, many nodes may exhibit unreliable behavior. Ensuring the overall functionality of WSNs in the presence of faulty nodes is a critical issue that has been extensively studied by computer science and engineering researchers. They have proposed many fault-tolerant schemes that have been successfully applied to various monitoring applications. However, these schemes fail in the specific application of structural health monitoring (SHM).

The objective of SHM is to monitor the integrity of structures and detect and pinpoint the locations of any possible damage. In a typical SHM system, an array of sensors, such as accelerometers or strain gauges, is deployed on a structure to periodically collect its responses to ambient or forced excitation. These measurements are aggregated in a centralized server where a SHM algorithm is used to extract damage-sensitive vibration characteristics. From these characteristics, structural damage can be detected and located.

Unlike traditional event and target detection, where each sensor node detects events or targets by comparing received energy (e.g., light, vibration, temperature) to a threshold, SHM relies on vibration characteristics. Accurate identification of these characteristics requires raw data from multiple sensor nodes, with each node providing a sequence of data typically exceeding one thousand values.

Various types of faults can occur in the wireless sensor nodes deployed in an SHM system. While some faults, such as battery depletion or transceiver failure, are easily identified, we are particularly interested in faulty sensor readings. These nodes appear to function normally but return incorrect values, often due to partial or complete debonding from the host structure, sensor degradation, or breakage. Since this type of fault is difficult to detect, it can significantly affect the damage detection capability of the system. Previous fault-tolerance schemes, such as decision fusion and value fusion, are not effective in SHM because they do not account for the unique requirements of SHM.

Civil engineering researchers have also proposed some SHM algorithms to detect faulty sensor readings, but these are centralized, computationally intensive, and assume the structure is healthy. Therefore, they cannot distinguish between faulty sensors and structural damage.

In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant SHM approach that can handle faulty sensor readings. Our scheme adopts a multi-layer approach, using natural frequencies and mode shapes at each layer. Sensor nodes are partitioned into clusters, and faulty nodes are detected within each cluster. This approach is lightweight and can disambiguate structural damage from sensor faults. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through both simulation and real implementation.

### Fault Tolerance in WSNs
Fault tolerance in WSNs, especially in the presence of faulty sensor readings, has been extensively studied. The primary application background includes event or target detection in battlefield surveillance, habitat monitoring, and environmental monitoring. The main goal is to achieve correct detection even when some sensor nodes provide faulty readings.

A widely adopted fault-tolerant strategy is decision fusion, where each sensor node makes a local decision, typically a binary value, which is then combined at a fusion center. Spatial redundancy is utilized, and optimal fusion algorithms have been developed under different criteria. A distributed version of this strategy was proposed to make it more applicable to WSNs, where each sensor node communicates with its neighbors to collect and combine local decisions.

Another type of fusion is value fusion, where sensors exchange their measured values before making decisions. Simulation results show that value fusion outperforms decision fusion in highly reliable networks, but decision fusion is better when there are more faulty sensors.

### Limitations in SHM
Although these fusion schemes have been successful in many WSN applications, they are not suitable for SHM. SHM uses a different approach to detect structural damage, relying on the identification of vibration characteristics from raw data. This process requires data-level collaboration among multiple sensor nodes, typically involving complex matrix computations like eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition. Individual sensor nodes cannot reliably detect damage, even if they are not faulty.

Decision fusion, which detects faulty nodes based on differences in local decisions, is not applicable in SHM because individual nodes cannot make correct local decisions about structural damage. Value fusion, which involves exchanging raw data, is also not feasible in SHM due to the large data size and the high communication and energy costs.

### Civil Engineering Approaches
Civil engineering researchers have proposed methods to detect faulty sensor readings, such as comparing the subspace of response with the subspace generated by lower modes of a structural model, using auto-associative neural networks for principal component analysis (PCA), and detecting, isolating, and reconstructing faulty sensors. However, these approaches assume the structure is healthy and are not capable of distinguishing between sensor faults and structural damage. Additionally, they are centralized and require all sensor data to be aggregated to a central unit, making them unsuitable for resource-limited WSNs.

## III. Proposed Method
Our proposed method for fault-tolerant SHM is a multi-layer approach that uses natural frequencies and mode shapes to detect faulty sensor nodes and structural damage. The sensor nodes are partitioned into clusters, and the detection of faulty nodes is implemented within each cluster.

### First Layer: Detection of Faulty Nodes
In the first layer, faulty sensor nodes are detected using natural frequencies. The premise is that the natural frequencies identified from normal sensor nodes are similar within the same cluster but different from those obtained from faulty nodes. This allows us to identify and isolate faulty nodes.

### Second Layer: Detection of Structural Damage
After faulty nodes are detected and isolated, the second layer uses mode shapes to detect possible structural damage. This approach is lightweight and can effectively distinguish between structural damage and sensor faults.

## IV. Simulation Results
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through simulations. The results show that our method can accurately detect and isolate faulty sensor nodes and correctly identify structural damage.

## V. Real Implementation
We also validate our approach through a real implementation on a simulated suspension bridge. The results confirm the robustness and effectiveness of our fault-tolerant SHM approach.

## VI. Conclusion
In this paper, we have addressed the fault tolerance problem in WSN-based SHM. We proposed a lightweight, multi-layer approach that can distinguish between structural damage and faulty sensor readings. Our method is effective and has been validated through both simulation and real implementation. Future work will focus on further improving the efficiency and scalability of the approach.
