This was exposed by #8200 and "fixed" by #8218, but the underlying problem
that caused the segfault to randomly show up and disappear when rebuilding
julia is probably still exists.
To summarize the thread in #8200, there's a bug that causes a segfault.
However, it only affects some builds. Rebuilding can make the bug appear or
disappear, and running with `make -j n`, for different `n`, seems to affect
the probability of a bad build.
