ABSTRACT
Remote censorship measurement techniques offer capabilities for
monitoring Internet reachability around the world. However, op-
erating these techniques continuously is labor-intensive and re-
quires specialized knowledge and synchronization, leading to lim-
ited adoption. In this paper, we introduce Censored Planet, an online
censorship measurement platform that collects and analyzes mea-
surements from ongoing deployments of four remote measurement
techniques (Augur, Satellite/Iris, Quack, and Hyperquack). Cen-
sored Planet adopts a modular design that supports synchronized
baseline measurements on six Internet protocols as well as cus-
tomized measurements that target specific countries and websites.
Censored Planet has already collected and published more than
21.8 billion data points of longitudinal network observations over
20 months of operation. Censored Planet complements existing
censorship measurement platforms such as OONI and ICLab by
offering increased scale, coverage, and continuity. We introduce a
new representative censorship metric and show how time series
analysis can be applied to Censored Planet’s longitudinal mea-
surements to detect 15 prominent censorship events, two-thirds of
which have not been reported previously. Using trend analysis, we
find increasing censorship activity in more than 100 countries, and
we identify 11 categories of websites facing increasing censorship,
including provocative attire, human rights issues, and news media.
We hope that the continued publication of Censored Planet data
helps counter the proliferation of growing restrictions to online
freedom.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Internet Freedom community’s understanding of the current
state and global scope of censorship remains limited: most work
has focused on the practices of particular countries, or on the reach-
ability of limited sets of online services from a small number of
volunteers. Creating a global, data-driven view of censorship is a
challenging proposition, since practices are intentionally opaque,
censorship mechanisms may vary, and there are numerous loca-
tions where disruptions can occur. Moreover, the behavior of the
network can vary depending on who is requesting content from
which location.
Established efforts to measure censorship globally utilize dis-
tributed deployments or volunteer networks of end-user devices [7,
104]. These offer direct access to some networks and can be used to
conduct detailed experiments from those locations, but because of
the need to recruit volunteers (and keep them safe) or the minuscule
number of accessible endpoints in many regions of interest, they
suffer from three key challenges: scale, coverage, and continuity.
Consequently, the resulting data tends to be sparse and ill-suited
for discovering events and trends among countries or across time.
Recent work has introduced an entirely different approach that
offers a safer and more scalable means of measuring global cen-
sorship. This family of measurement techniques, including Augur,
Quack, Satellite, Iris, and Hyperquack, use network side-channels
to efficiently and remotely detect network anomalies from tens of
thousands of vantage points without relying on dedicated probing
infrastructure in the field [77, 78, 93, 100, 106]. Despite overcoming
the traditional limitations of vantage point and participant selection
and providing an unprecedented breadth of coverage, these tech-
niques have some shortcomings. Each technique only focuses on
one particular type of blocking, and hence does not provide a com-
plete view of global censorship. Thus far, the techniques have only
been evaluated on measurements conducted over a limited period of
time, and hence did not grapple with the complexities of continuous,
longitudinal data collection and analysis. None of the techniques
are designed to differentiate between localized censorship by a van-
tage point operator and ISP- or country-wide censorship policies.
Moreover, they do not have mechanisms to verify censorship and
hence may suffer from false positives.
To overcome these challenges, we introduce Censored Planet,
a global and longitudinal censorship measurement platform that
collects censorship data using multiple remote measurement tech-
niques and analyzes the data to create a more complete view of
global censorship. Censored Planet’s modular design synchronizes
vantage point and test list selection processes, and schedules cen-
sorship measurements on six Internet protocols. Censored Planet
captures a continuous baseline of reachability data for 2,000 do-
mains and IP addresses each week from more than 95,000 vantage

cal diversity and the safety of remote operators. In addition, Cen-
sored Planet’s design offers rapid focus capabilities that allow us
to quickly and agilely conduct more intensive measurements of
particular countries or content in response to world events. We
make data from Censored Planet available to the public in the form
of up-to-date snapshots and historical data sets1.
Since its launch in August 2018, Censored Planet has collected
and published more than 21.8 billion data points of baseline longi-
tudinal network observations. Complementing previous work such
as OONI (web connectivity tests) and ICLab, Censored Planet offers
widespread coverage by running measurements in 66 (42%)–173
(360%) more countries with a median increase of 4–7 Autonomous
Systems (AS) per country. The platform’s rapid focus capability
has helped provide insights into important events such as the re-
cent large-scale HTTPS interception in Kazakhstan that has helped
inform policy changes by two major web browsers [64, 98, 99].
Censored Planet processes censorship measurement data to en-
hance detection accuracy by removing false positives using cluster-
ing techniques [100] and obtains a novel representative measure for
censorship within a country through smoothing using an optimiza-
tion model. We introduce techniques for analyzing the observatory
data by modeling it as a time series and applying a Bitmap-based
anomaly detection technique for finding censorship events. Addi-
tionally, we use the Mann-Kendall test for detecting trends over
time. We show how these techniques, when applied on our longitu-
dinal measurements, enable Censored Planet to detect 15 prominent
censorship events during its 20-month period of measurement, two-
thirds of which have not been reported previously. Investigation
into public OONI and ICLab data further reveals that the limitations
of traditional volunteer-based measurement (sparse data due to low
continuity and limited scale) result in the absence of data related
to most events detected by Censored Planet. These events reveal
heightened censorship in many countries, including some (such as
Japan and Norway) that have previously been regarded as having
strong Internet freedom [46]. Using trend analysis, we find increas-
ing censorship activity in more than 100 countries, particularly
using DNS and HTTPS blocking methods. We also find 11 cate-
gories of websites that are being censored increasingly, including
provocative attire, human rights issues, and news media.
Censored Planet’s contribution is not limited to public longitudi-
nal measurement data and analysis techniques; we have been using
Censored Planet’s rapid focus capabilities to accommodate requests
for measurements from the censorship community and investigate
important events in detail. In this paper, we highlight an instance of
the use of rapid focus measurement into investigating the sudden
blocking of Cloudflare IPs by Turkmenistan.
Our results demonstrate Censored Planet’s ability to create a
more complete picture of global censorship that is complementary
to both existing platforms such as OONI and ICLab [7], as well as
qualitative reports, such as the annual Freedom on the Net Report
by Freedom House [46]. We show through data-driven analysis
that qualitative reports often cover only a small number of coun-
tries and that there are significant increasing trends in censorship
in countries considered as “Free”. The continued publication of

Censored Planet data will allow researchers to continuously mon-
itor the deployment of network interference technologies, track
policy changes in censoring nations, and better understand the
targets of interference. Ultimately, we hope that making opaque
censorship practices more transparent at a global scale counters
the proliferation of these growing restrictions to online freedom.
2 BACKGROUND
Two decades of research on Internet censorship has illustrated it to
be both pervasive and diverse across methods, targets, regions, and
timing.
Censorship Methods. The most commonly used censorship
methods are shutdowns, DNS manipulation, IP-based blocking, and
HTTP-layer interference. In case of Internet shutdowns, the censor
restricts access to the Internet completely (not to a specific web-
site) [31, 112]. DNS manipulation describes cases where the user
receives incorrect DNS replies. These can include non-routable IP
addresses, the address of a censor-controlled server hosting a block-
page, or no reply at all [8]. IP or TCP layer disruption occurs when
network-level connections to specific destination IPs or IP:Port
tuples are dropped or reset. This method has been specifically used
to block circumvention proxies, and is how China prevents access
to the Tor network [5]. In HTTP(S) blocking, web traffic is dis-
rupted when specific keywords, like a domain, are observed in the
application payload. When detected, censoring systems may drop
the traffic, reset the connection, or show a blockpage [32, 57, 100].
When HTTP traffic is sent over a TLS encrypted channel, the re-
quested domain continues to be sent in the initial unencrypted
message, providing a selector for censorship (i.e. the SNI extension
of a valid TLS ClientHello message).
To understand the true scale and nuanced evolution of Internet
censorship and how it affects global Internet communication, mul-
tiple projects have built platforms to continuously collect measure-
ment data. The Open Observatory of Network Inference (OONI) [43,
104] collects measurements from end users who download, update,
and run client software. The ICLab [7, 51] project uses a set of VPN
providers to probe from a diverse set of networks. These platforms
benefit from direct access to vantage points in residential networks
and the ability to customize measurements, and they have proven
invaluable in measuring censorship. However, they are challenging
to scale, have coverage and continuity limitations, and the data
they collect tends to be sparse and unsuitable for discovering finer
censorship trends among countries or across time. Moreover, main-
taining a distributed network involves pushing updates and new
measurements to all vantage points or volunteers which may lead
to delays in detection of new types of censorship.
In recent years, remote measurement techniques have shown
that it is possible to leverage side channels in existing Internet pro-
tocols for interacting with remote systems, and inferring whether
the connection is disrupted from their responses.
Remote Detection of TCP/IP Blocking. Spooky scan em-
ployed a side channel for determining the state of TCP/IP reacha-
bility between two remote network hosts [37], regardless of where
these two remote systems (e.g., site and client) are located. In the
experimental setup, the measurement machine needed to be able to
spoof packets, one of the remote hosts needed to have a single SYN

remote host needed to have a single, shared, incrementing counter
for generating IP identifier values. By monitoring the progression
of this counter over time, while attempting to perturb it from other
locations on the Internet, the method detects when connections
succeed between pairs of Internet endpoints.
The technique was extended by Augur [77], demonstrating how
this channel can be used for broad, continuous blocking detec-
tion. Augur adds a host selection subsystem to ensure that it per-
forms measurements from Internet infrastructure, only considering
routers located two or more traceroute hops upstream from end
hosts and follows the ethical guidelines set out in the Menlo and Bel-
mont reports [34, 68]. Augur also makes use of statistical hypothesis
testing to limit false detection when run at scale.
Remote Detection of DNS Manipulation. There have been
many studies that explored DNS manipulation using open DNS
resolvers, most notably Satellite and Iris [78, 93]. Satellite scans
for IPv4 resolvers that have been active for more than a month,
uses clustering techniques to detect CDN deployments, and detects
incorrect DNS responses from this information. Iris is a scalable and
ethical system that identifies DNS manipulation which restricts user
access to content (not just natural inconsistencies). To achieve high
detection accuracy, Iris performs both test measurements to open
DNS resolvers and control measurements to trusted resolvers and
compares the responses using several heuristics including matching
the resolved IP, HTTP content hashes, TLS certificates, AS number
and AS name, and checking whether the TLS certificate is browser-
trusted. Iris has a higher standard for minimizing risk to operators
of DNS resolvers by only choosing name servers using their DNS
PTR records. Our adopted technique is a synthesis of Satellite and
Iris, built on Satellite’s engineering efforts. For simplicity, instead
of Satellite/Iris, we just use “Satellite”.
Remote Detection of HTTP(S) Blocking. Quack uses servers
that support the TCP Echo protocol (open port 7) as vantage points
to detect application-layer blocking triggered on HTTP and TLS
headers [106]. Quack detects interference based on whether the
server successfully echoes back (over several trials) a packet con-
taining a sensitive keyword. Quack uses control measurements
both before and after test measurements to ensure that interference
is caused by the keyword tested, and not due to the inconsistencies
of the network. Quack also uses Echo’s sibling Discard protocol to
learn the directionality of interference. Quack makes use of more
than 50,000 available echo servers in different countries and follows
ethical norms by running Nmap OS-detection scans and selecting
only infrastructural Echo servers in restrictive countries [46].
Hyperquack extends Quack by measuring HTTP and HTTPS
blocking on port 80 and port 443 in a scalable, longitudinal, and
safe way [100]. Hyperquack detects interference on HTTP(S) traffic
by making use of publicly accessible web servers with consistent
behavior as vantage points. Hyperquack first builds a template of a
public web server’s typical response by requesting bogus domains
that are not hosted on the server. It then sends requests with the
HTTP "Host" header or TLS SNI extension set to a domain of inter-
est. If there is a censor blocking the domain on the path between
the measurement machine and the public web server, the measure-
ment machine will receive a TCP RST, a blockpage, or experience a

connection timeout that does not match the web server’s typical
response. Hyperquack selects infrastructural servers operated by
ISPs as vantage points using data from PeeringDB [79].
To continuously monitor censorship and accurately derive in-
sights using these complex remote measurement techniques, we
need a new scalable, efficient and extensible platform. In this paper,
we introduce Censored Planet, a global and longitudinal censorship
measurement platform that collects censorship data using multiple
remote measurement techniques and analyzes the data to create a
more complete view of global censorship.
3 CENSORED PLANET DESIGN
To succeed as a global, longitudinal censorship measurement plat-
form and perform synchronized measurements on 6 different Inter-
net protocols (IP, DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, Echo and Discard) amidst
the volatility and spatiotemporal variability of Internet censorship
and the risk associated with measuring it, Censored Planet should
be: scalable, continuous, synchronized, sound, extensible, and eth-
ical. Censored Planet must scale to cover many vantage points,
as we know that censorship changes across countries and even
within regions [2, 9, 19, 85, 118]. Censorship also changes across
time, so Censored Planet must be able to run repeated measure-
ments regularly to capture censorship events and observe changes
quickly [7, 38, 100]. Censored Planet must synchronize input lists
and measurements between different measurement techniques in
order to achieve completeness and comparability. Censored Planet’s
measurement and analysis methods should aim to avoid false pos-
itives and obtain an accurate representation of censorship [100].
Finally, Censored Planet’s design and measurements must satisfy
the ethical principles that we explain further in §3.1.
Session 1A: Anonymous Routing and Censorship CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA51With these design goals in mind, we opt for a modular design for
Censored Planet that aids in collecting and analyzing large-scale
measurements (cf. Figure 1):
• Test Requests. First, scan configurations are set based on
requests from the community (e.g. customized list of domains
from journalists for rapid focus testing) or triggers from
previous Censored Planet scans in response to anomalous
event alerts.
• Input Scanner. We implement an input-selection subsys-
tem that chooses a list of domains to test, a list of vantage
points, and other inputs required for Censored Planet’s oper-
ation. We build this module to be flexible enough to produce
input for both longitudinal, continuous measurements, and
for directed, exploratory measurements (§4.1).
• Interference Scanner. This module is the core of Censored
Planet’s remote measurements. It performs and monitors
Internet-wide scans for detecting the interference of test
domains, ensuring scale and coverage (§4.2).
• Data Pre-processing. To ensure accuracy, we remove false
positives from Censored Planet data, utilizing recently intro-
duced clustering techniques [100] (§5.1).
• Censorship Analysis. Since censorship policies can vary
within countries and regions, we build an optimization model
for Censored Planet data that smooths diverging country-
level results and obtains a representative metric for censor-
ship in a country (§5.2).
