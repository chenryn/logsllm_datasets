the  center.  Among  interesting  features  we  can  observe  vertical 
lines  of  various  width  demonstrating  continuous  accesses  to 
specific  cache  lines.  Moreover,  one  also  sees  certain  vertical 
stripes conflicting with the AES S-Box accesses generating cache-
misses and causing longer encryption times when using those S-
box  entries.  Now,  the  crucial  observation  here  is  the  following: 
the  exploitable  different  AES  execution  times,  when  averaged 
over many iterations are due to system-dependent cache-evictions. 
By  varying  over  all  possible  values  for  the  individual  plaintext 
bytes, Bernstein's technique is implicitly searching for those cache 
evictions  by  the  system.  This  leads  then  to  small  execution  time 
differences for certain plaintext inputs.

really possible? Dan Bernstein uses two phases: a profiling phase 
first where the system under attack is analyzed with a known key 
and later an attacking phase with an unknown key. Finally, their 
correlation discloses several key bits. Because cache latencies are 
tiny compared to network delays, Bernstein’s attack would require 
an  extensive  number  of  measurements  to  extract  the  cache 
behavior  from  the  overall  time.  However,  advanced  attackers 
could  increase  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  by  submitting  carefully 
chosen plaintexts. This comes from the following observation: the 
profiles  for  each  byte  are  deeply  linked  to  the  position  of  the  S-
box  tables  loaded  into  the  cache.  Therefore,  some  bytes  present 
similar  profiles  that  can  be  combined  to  reduce  the  noise. 
Moreover, specially chosen plaintexts taking advantage of the S-
boxes’ location in the cache lead in some cases to a single peak as 
visible  from  the  following  picture.  It  shows  the  correlation 
between  the  attack  phase  and  the  profiling  phase  for  one  fixed 
byte.  Using  such  chosen 
plain-text  amplifications,

recovery

becomes

ABSTRACT
In  a  recent  manuscript  Dan  Bernstein  claims  the  successful  
extraction of an AES key from a network server through another  
client computer. His side-channel attack was actually the simplest 
conceivable timing analysis of AES. Although Bernstein gave no 
thorough analysis of his methodology or the underlying technique 
the paper contained the full C-source code. This was actually very 
useful  to  repeat,  analyze  and  extend  his  experiments  and 
technique. Our paper improves upon the work done by Bernstein 
in the following ways: 
1) We  present  a  thorough  analysis  of  his  used  methodology 
hereby formally proving why and how his technique works. 
From  this  analysis  we  also  derive  a  general  limit  on  the 
number  of  derivable  key  bits  through  his  technique  which 
depends on the architecture of the underlying CPU. 
2) We  show 
the  results  of  several 
important  practical 
experiments.  Those  undermine  first  that  the  pure  Bernstein 
technique  cannot  extract  in  practice  all  key  bits  even  when 
the  sample  space  is  drastically  increased.  Second,  they  give 
evidence,  that  the  Bernstein  technique  itself  cannot  be 
changed  simply  into  a  real  remote  side-channel  analysis  by 
just letting the client computer measuring himself the round 
trip times of his queries to the server. 
3) Motivated  by 
the  above  shortcomings  of  Bernstein's 
technique we improve upon his technique: while he uses only 
first round information, we show how to use this first round 
information to extract second round information. Thus, using 
a much lower number of samples this second round analysis 
allows  for  a  direct  full  AES  key  recovery  through  simple 
overall timing measurements. 
Our  results  aim  at  solving  several  fundamental  open  problems 
related to this kind of AES side-channel analysis:
