 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.30.0
**Issue**  
We have a solution with a number of web projects. We recently made a new
project which used a tsconfig.json file.
This affected other projects to believe they had a tsconfig.json file,
overriding our project typescript settings for those projects.
"One or more tsconfig.json files detected. Project properties are disabled."
I've checked and the project file itself does not contain any reference to any
tsconfig.json files nor does the project folder contain a tsconfig file.
**Reproduce**
  1. Create two new Web Api projects in same solution.
  2. Add a typescript file to each project and accept that they are converted into a typescript project.
  3. Add a tsconfig.json to the second project.
  4. Open properties for the first project and go to the TypeScript Build Tab. Observe "One or more tsconfig.json files detected. Project properties are disabled."
**Code**
    // None
**Expected behavior:**
tsconfig.json detection to only work within project folder or files defined in
the project file.
**Actual behavior:**
tsconfig,json detection aparently appears on a solution level or at least a
project will detect tsconfig files that are in other projects folders.
