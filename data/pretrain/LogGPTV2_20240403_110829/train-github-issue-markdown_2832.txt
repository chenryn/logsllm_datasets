**Current behavior**  
A template that refers to a static property of the component class from
formGroup as below fails with "formGroup expects a FormGroup instance. Please
pass one in" in Angular 4. Works if the property is a non-static instance
member.
              ...
    export class TestHostComponent implements OnInit {
      public static readonly metaFormGroup: FormGroup = new FormGroup({
        ...
      });
     ...
    };
**Expected behavior**  
The template should be able to refer to static members of a component, just
like it can refer to instance members.
