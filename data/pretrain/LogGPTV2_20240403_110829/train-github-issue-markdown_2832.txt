**Current Behavior:**

When a template references a static property of the component class from `formGroup`, it fails with the error: "formGroup expects a FormGroup instance. Please pass one in." This issue occurs in Angular 4. The template works correctly if the property is a non-static instance member.

For example, consider the following code:

```typescript
export class TestHostComponent implements OnInit {
  public static readonly metaFormGroup: FormGroup = new FormGroup({
    // form controls and configurations
  });

  // other component logic
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

The template should be able to reference static members of a component, just as it can reference instance members.

**Environment Information:**

- **Angular Version:** 4.0.0
- **Browser:** Chrome
- **Language:** TypeScript 2.2.1
- **Node (for AoT issues):** `node --version` = 7.6
