The error is:  
_OperationalError: ( _mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1054, "Unknown
column 'created_by' in 'order clause'") [SQL: u'SELECT dashboards.created_on
AS dashboards_created_on, dashboards.changed_on AS dashboards_changed_on,

dashboards.css AS dashboards_css, dashboards.json_metadata AS
dashboards_json_metadata, dashboards.slug AS dashboards_slug,
dashboards.changed_by_fk AS dashboards_changed_by_fk, dashboards.created_by_fk
AS dashboards_created_by_fk \nFROM dashboards ORDER BY created_by asc \n LIMIT
%s'] [parameters: (100,)]_
My tested result :  
"ORDER BY **created_on** " is work。  
“dbs” table has “created_on” field instead of “created_by”.
