User: Using the local dev server, I can use ';' in urls, but as soon as I try the live version hosted by Google, it looks like the ';' and everything afterward is stripped (at least according to request.path_qs).
(I would prefer not to encode them if possible, it's much less user friendly if the url cannot be constructed by copy-pasting, especially since other characters works fine, e.g. ':').
Assistant: Issue816 has now been fixed, semi-colons are usable with appengine.
