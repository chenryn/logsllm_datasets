When using the local development server, I am able to include semicolons (`;`) in URLs. However, when I deploy the application to the live version hosted by Google, it appears that the semicolon and any characters following it are being stripped from the URL, at least according to `request.path_qs`.

I would prefer not to encode these semicolons if possible, as it makes the URL less user-friendly. Users should be able to construct the URL simply by copy-pasting, especially since other special characters, such as colons (`:`), work fine.

**Update:** The issue (Issue #816) has now been resolved, and semicolons are now supported in URLs on App Engine.
