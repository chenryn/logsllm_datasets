### Troubleshooting Failures with ETH-SLM

#### Problem
The Ethernet synthetic loss measurement (ETH-SLM) application is not working properly for calculation of frame loss using synthetic frames instead of data traffic.

#### Solution
1. Ensure that ETH-SLM is configured (either proactive or on-demand) to initiate SLM frames. Verify the configuration settings.
2. Examine any failures that might have occurred in the CFM session for which the ETH-SLM feature is enabled. The CFM session must be in the up state for the ETH-SLM functionality to work correctly. Use the following command to verify whether the CFM session is in the up state:
   ```shell
   show oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management mep-database maintenance-domain <md-name> maintenance-association <ma-name> local-mep <mep-id> remote-mep <remote-mep-id>
   ```
3. If the MEP sessions are active, use the appropriate `show` command to verify the ETH-SLM statistics and to analyze if ETH-SLM frames are transmitted or received.
4. If the transmission of ETH-SLM frames does not happen correctly after you attempt all of the preceding troubleshooting steps, enable the tracing operations for Ethernet CFM by including the `traceoptions` statement at the `[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]` hierarchy level:
   ```shell
   [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
   traceoptions {
       file /var/log/eth-slm-trace.log;
       flag all;
       no-remote-trace;
   }
   ```

### Ethernet Alarm Indication

#### Ethernet Alarm Indication Signal (ETH-AIS) Function Overview

##### Understanding ETH-AIS in a Maintenance Domain
ITU-T developed Y.1731 as a recommendation for Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions and mechanisms for Ethernet-based networks, including OAM functions such as ETH-AIS, Ethernet locked signal (ETH-LCK), Ethernet test signal (ETH-Test), Ethernet automatic protection switching (ETH-APS), Ethernet maintenance communication channel (ETH-MCC), Ethernet experimental OAM (ETH-EXP), Ethernet vendor-specific OAM (ETH-VSP), and performance monitoring.

According to the Y.1731 standards, a server MEP is a combined function of the server layer termination function and the server Ethernet services layer adaptation function. The server MEP notifies the Ethernet services (ETH) layer MEPs when it detects a failure. The server layer termination function then runs the OAM mechanisms specific to the server layer, and the alarms are suppressed at the server layer by ETH-AIS.

Note that ETH-AIS is not applicable to Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) networks.

ETH-AIS provides many advantages, including:
- Service providers need not raise alarms if there are lower-level failures.
- Service providers can provide a refund to their subscribers or avail a refund from their Internet provider based on service unavailability.

MX Series routers support ITU-T Y.1731 ETH-AIS to provide fault management for service providers who provide carrier Ethernet services using IEEE 802.1ag standard.

**Note:** MX Series Virtual Chassis does not support Ethernet alarm indication signal (ETH-AIS).

##### Fault Detection in a Maintenance Domain
In the scenario depicted in Figure 1, you have a service provider level and a customer level. Two service providers—Operator-1 and Operator-2—are considered for illustration purposes. Assume that a fault occurs in Operator-1's maintenance domain-level that has MEP-A and MEP-B at its maintenance domain-level boundaries. To notify the faults to a network management system and to avoid notification of alarms from the customer level for the same fault, MEP-A and MEP-B transmit an alarm indication signal (AIS) on opposite directions, thereby signaling the higher levels and the Operator-2 network about the fault, so that the alarms are suppressed.

Signaling is achieved through the transmission and propagation of AIS protocol data units (PDUs). You must enable AIS explicitly on all the MEPs at the service provider level. A MEP that is configured to issue frames with ETH-AIS information is generally at the server layer and continues to transmit periodic frames with ETH-AIS information until the defect condition is cleared. When a client MEP receives the ETH-AIS frames, it suppresses loss-of-continuity alarms associated with its peer MEPs.

Note that in the absence of AIS, a client MEP resumes generating loss-of-continuity alarms when it detects the loss-of-continuity defect conditions from its server layer.

For point-to-point Ethernet services layer connectivity, a MEP has only one peer MEP. Therefore, there is no ambiguity regarding the peer MEP for which the MEP should suppress alarms when it receives the ETH-AIS information.

For multipoint Ethernet services layer connectivity, a MEP that receives ETH-AIS information cannot determine the exact MEP that encountered the fault and, therefore, cannot isolate the exact peer MEP to suppress the alarms. To avoid this scenario, Y.1731 recommends suppressing alarms for all peer MEPs in the same domain level irrespective of connectivity status in a multipoint Ethernet services layer connectivity setup.

##### Terms Defined
- **AIS transmission**: A MEP upon detecting a defect condition transmits AIS frames in a direction opposite to its peer MEPs. The periodicity of AIS frames transmission is based on the AIS transmission period. An AIS transmission period of 1 second is recommended. The first AIS frame must always be transmitted immediately following the detection of a defect condition.
- **AIS reception**: Upon receiving an AIS frame, a MEP examines it to ensure that the frame’s maintenance domain level is the same as its own maintenance domain level. The period field in the frame indicates the period at which the AIS frames can be expected. When a MEP receives an AIS frame, it detects the defect condition. After detection, when no AIS frames are received within an interval of 3.5 times the AIS transmission period indicated in the AIS frames received, the MEP clears the AIS defect condition. When the AIS condition is cleared and defects still exist, then the MEPs continue to report alarms.
- **AIS PDU format**: The fields of the AIS PDU format are:
  1. MEG Level: Also called the maintenance domain level, it is a 3-bit field that carries the maintenance domain level of the client MEG.
  2. Version: Value is always 0.
  3. OpCode: Value for this PDU type is AIS (33).
  4. Flags: The first five bits are reserved and set to 0. The 3-bit information element carried in the three least significant bits are referred to as the period that contains the value of AIS transmission periodicity as illustrated in Table 20.
  5. TLV offset: Set to 0.
  6. End TLV: All-zeroes octet value.

##### Server Layer and Client Layer
These layers are part of the ITU-T Recommendation G.805 transport network functional model. This model is based on the concept of layering within a transport network. A transport network is divided into several independent transport layer networks that have a client-server association between adjacent layer networks.

##### Maintenance Domain
To enable connectivity fault management (CFM) on an Ethernet interface, maintenance domains, maintenance associations, and maintenance end points (MEPs) are created and configured in a network. You can configure up to eight maintenance domain levels in a network. Each maintenance domain level is a part of the network where the connectivity issues can be monitored and corrected. Provider domain and customer domain are some examples of maintenance domains. Each maintenance domain has a maintenance association. Each maintenance association includes MEPs and maintenance intermediate points (MIPs) in that domain. The MEPs are located at the boundary of the domain, and the MIPs are located within the domain. MEPs generate and transmit continuity check messages (CCMs) at configured intervals to the entire maintenance association to check the connectivity in the network.

##### Ethernet Services (ETH) Layer
A layer in the metro Ethernet network model, where this layer is responsible for the OAM services required to support the Ethernet services in the network.

### Ethernet Alarm Indication Signal Overview

ACX Series routers support ITU-T Y.1731 Ethernet Alarm Indication Signal function (ETH-AIS) to provide fault management for service providers. ETH-AIS enables you to suppress alarms when a fault condition is detected. Using ETH-AIS, an administrator can differentiate between faults at the customer level or faults at the provider level.

The advantage of ETH-AIS is:
- Customers need not raise alarms due to lower-level failures.
- Customers can get a refund based on service unavailability.

When a fault condition is detected, a maintenance end point (MEP) generates ETH-AIS packets to the configured client levels for a specified duration until the fault condition is cleared. Any MEP configured to generate ETH-AIS packets signals to a level higher than its own. A MEP receiving ETH-AIS recognizes that the fault is at a lower level and then suppresses alarms at the current level.

ACX Series routers support ETH-AIS PDU generation for server MEPs based on the following defect conditions:
- Loss of connectivity (physical link loss detection)
- Layer 2 circuit or Layer 2 VPN down

Alarm indication signaling is done through the transmission and propagation of ETH-AIS PDUs. ETH-AIS should be enabled on MEPs. A MEP that is configured to issue packets with ETH-AIS information is generally of the server layer and continues to transmit periodic packets with ETH-AIS information until the defect condition is cleared. CFM MEPs, upon receiving ETH-AIS PDUs, suppress loss of continuity alarms associated with their peer MEPs. A MEP resumes loss of continuity alarm generation upon detecting loss of continuity defect conditions in the absence of an ETH-AIS condition.

For point-to-point Ethernet connectivity, a MEP has only a single peer MEP. Therefore, a MEP suppresses alarms on its peer MEP when it receives the ETH-AIS information.

For multi-point Ethernet connectivity, a MEP that receives ETH-AIS information cannot determine the exact MEP that encountered a fault condition and, therefore, will not be able to isolate the exact peer MEP for alarm suppression. ITU-T Y.1731 recommends suppressing alarms for all peer MEPs irrespective of the connectivity status.

- **AIS transmission**: A MEP, upon detecting a defect condition, transmits ETH-AIS PDUs in a direction opposite to its peer MEPs. The transmission of ETH-AIS PDUs is based on a configured ETH-AIS transmission period. An ETH-AIS transmission period of 1 second is recommended. The first ETH-AIS PDU must be transmitted immediately following the detection of a defect condition.
- **AIS reception**: A MEP, upon receiving ETH-AIS PDUs, examines them to ensure that its maintenance domain (MD) level corresponds to the same MD level. Upon receiving an ETH-AIS PDU, the MEP detects a defect condition. Following the detection of a defect condition, if there are no ETH-AIS PDUs received within an interval of 3.5 times the ETH-AIS transmission period indicated in the ETH-AIS PDUs received earlier, the MEP clears the defect condition. After the fault condition is cleared, MEPs continue to report alarms.
