ness, we focus on three of them including degree distribution,
eigencentrality, and triangle count. The degree distribution
represents the proportion of users with a certain degree
for all possible degrees. Eigencentrality evaluates the inﬂu-
ence/importance of each user in a graph. It assigns a centrality
score for each user based on the eigenvector of the graph’s
adjacency matrix. Triangle count summarizes the number of
triangles each user belongs to in a graph which reﬂects the
graph connectivity [24]. We compute the three properties for
G, GA, and GF , and calculate the cosine similarity between
G’s and GA’s properties as well as between G’s and GF ’s
properties. Higher similarity naturally implies better utility.
Figure 9 presents the results. We ﬁrst observe a strong

We emphasize that
graph de-anonymization is orthogonal to our graph recovery
attack. First of all, graph de-anonymization attacks aim to
identify users in an anonymized graph while our graph re-
covery aims to ﬁnd fake added edges. As shown in Section V,
our graph recovery can degrade anonymized graphs’ privacy
guarantees. The reason our graph recovery cannot increase the
performance of graph de-anonymization (in our case, of the
NS-attack), is that most of the graph de-anonymization attacks
assume a much stronger attack model than those considered
in graph anonymization mechanisms. Therefore, we propose
privacy loss metrics tailored to k-DA and SalaDP, which we
believe are more appropriate. Moreover, we show that our
enhanced anonymization mechanisms that are inspired by our
graph recovery attack signiﬁcantly reduce the success rate of
graph de-anonymization.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we identify a fundamental vulnerability of
the existing graph anonymization mechanisms which do not
take into account key structural characteristics of a social
graph when adding fake edges to it. We propose an edge
plausibility metric based on graph embedding that enables us to
exploit this weakness in order to identify fake edges. Extensive
experiments show that, using this metric, we are able to
recover the original graph from an anonymized graph to a large
extent. Our graph recovery also results in signiﬁcant privacy
damage to the original anonymization mechanisms. To mitigate
this weakness, we propose enhancement over the existing
anonymization mechanisms. Our experiments show that our
enhanced mechanisms signiﬁcantly reduce the performance of
our graph recovery attack, increase graph de-anonymization
resistance, and at the same time provide better graph utility.

notice from Table IX that our enhanced mechanisms reduce the
total number of nodes that the NS-attack de-anonymizes (both
correct and wrong ones). This indicates that the NS-attack’s
ability to propagate also degrades in graphs anonymized by
our enhanced mechanisms.
VII. RELATED WORK
Various graph anonymization mechanisms have been pro-
posed in the literature [26], [52], [17], [8], [53], [46], [9], [36],
[48], [49], [31]. One class of these mechanisms follows the
concept of k-anonymity. Liu and Terzi [26] propose the ﬁrst
approach in this direction, i.e., k-DA, which we concentrate
on in this paper. Meanwhile, Zhou and Pei [52] propose k-
neighborhood anonymity, where each user in the anonymized
graph shares the same neighborhood, i.e., the sub-social net-
work among her friends, with at least k − 1 other users.
The authors adopt minimum BFS coding to represent each
user’s neighborhood, then rely on a greedy match to realize
k-neighborhood anonymity.
Another class of graph anonymization mechanisms is in-
spired by differential privacy. Besides SalaDP, multiple solu-
tions have been proposed [36], [48], [49]. For instance, Wang
and Wu [48] present a 2K-graph generation model to achieve
differential privacy, where noise is added based on smooth sen-
sitivity. Xiao et al. [49] encode users’ connection probabilities
with a hierarchical random graph model, and perform Markov
chain Monte Carlo to sample a possible graph structure from
the model while enforcing differential privacy. Besides the
above, other graph anonymization techniques include [17], [8],
[31].
Due to space constraints, we only consider the two most
widely known anonymization mechanisms,
i.e., k-DA and
SalaDP. In the future, we plan to apply our approach to more
anonymization mechanisms.
Besides anonymization, graph de-anonymization has been
extensively studied as well. Backstrom et al. are among the
ﬁrst to de-anonymize users in a naively anonymized social
graph [5]. The attack of Narayanan and Shmatikov is essen-
tially a framework [32], based on which multiple approaches
