I.  INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION 
computing  devices, 
Over  the  last  years,  aerial  and  ground  vehicles  as  well  as 
mobile robot systems have been receiving an increased number 
of electronic components, connected through wireless networks 
and  running  embedded  software.  This  strong  integration 
between  dedicated 
the  physical 
environment  and  networking,  composes  a  Cyber-Physical 
System  (CPS).  CPS  have  thus  become  part  of  common 
vehicles,  accessible  to  everyone,  such  as  automobiles  or 
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, as processing 
power  increases  and  software  becomes  more  sophisticated, 
these vehicles gain the ability to perform complex operations, 
becoming more autonomous, efficient, adaptable, comfortable, 
safe and usable. These are known as Intelligent Vehicles (IV). 
UAVs are now providing a flexible support for performing 
missions,  which  makes  it  possible  to  deploy  and  move  them 
around  in  scenarios  where  accessibility  was  difficult  or 
impossible, through the connection to sensor networks capable 
of  monitoring  a  wide  range  of  applications.  Automobiles  are 
able  to  offer  active  safety,  adaptive  cruise  control,  park 
assistance,  automatic  climate  control,  navigation  support  and, 
in  a  near  future,  vehicle  to  vehicle  communication.  These 
systems are classified as critical, once failure events may cause 
the  loss  of  human  lives  or  high-value  assets,  meaning  that 
safety  is  one  of  the  main  concerns  for  developers  and  users. 
However,  the  combination  of  high  mobility  and  wireless 
communications  has  further  increased  the  exposure  of  these 
systems  to  malicious  threats  and  to  faults  deriving  from 
uncertain  connectivity  or  communication  timeliness.  Non-
functional  requirements  like  security  and  real-time  operation 
have thus become harder to fulfill, creating new challenges to 
such safety-critical embedded systems.  
For  these  Intelligent  Vehicles  to  become  a  reality,  further 
research  and development  must  be  performed,  addressing  the 
needs  of  multidisciplinary  approaches  like  integrated  control 
systems,  communication  and  network,  security  algorithms, 
artificial 
intelligence,  verification  and  validation,  neural 
networks, safety assets and other technological concerns.  
The goal of this workshop is to explore the challenges and 
innovative solutions regarding Intelligent Vehicles, considering

the implications of security and real-time issues on safety and 
certification,  which  emerge  when  introducing  networked, 
autonomous and cooperative functionalities. It aims at joining 
together in an active debate, researchers and practitioners from 
several communities, namely dependability and security, real-
time  and  embedded  systems,  intelligent  transportation  and 
mobile robot systems.
