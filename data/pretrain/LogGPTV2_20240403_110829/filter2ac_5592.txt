**Recommendations:**
- **Screen Captures:** Users should be advised not to grant consent for screen captures unless they are explicitly expected and from a trusted source.
- **USB Debugging (Android Debug Bridge):** Users should avoid enabling USB debugging unless it is explicitly required for a specific, legitimate purpose. 

These precautions help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
