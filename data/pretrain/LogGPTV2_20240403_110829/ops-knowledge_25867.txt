User: I have a problem in virtualenv that a wrong python path is imported. 
The reason is that by running the command: 
manage.py help --pythonpath=/home/robert/Vadain/vadain.webservice.curtainconfig/
The result is right, but when I run manage.py help then I missing some imports. 
I searched on the internet, but nothing is helped. The last change I have done is at the end of the file virtualenvs/{account}/bin/activate added the following text: 
export PYTHONPATH=/home/robert/Vadain/vadain.webservice.curtainconfig
But this not solving the problem, somebody else's suggestion to fix this problem?
Assistant: The problem is solved due to add a python path: add2virtualenv '/home/robert/Vadain/vadain.webservice.curtainconfig/'
