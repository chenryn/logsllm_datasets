##### Detailed description
Much thanks to anyone who may help,
I am using the cv2.findcirclesgrid() in python script to detect the centers of
images of calibration board, but the results appear to be existing a shift
between the detected centers and visual centers(from my own point of view). As
follows:

I checked the blob detector this morning, it successfully extracted the
circles in my pictures. So maybe this shift is not because of the blob
parameters(I think so). As follows:

Anyhow, I wonder:
  1. Whether this should happen? apparent bias of extracted centers between real position.
  2. If the answer is 'it should not be like this', then what should I do?
##### Steps to reproduce
here is my code in python, appreciation for any information you may supply to
me
