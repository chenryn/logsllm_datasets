User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Veeam Backup (free version) can't find it's own server I have a few servers that each have a few vm's on them. After running the install of the free version of veeam backup, I go into the program and add the new servers first. The servers run 2008 R2 Enterprise and I'm using the latest version of the free version of veeam backup.

The program basically says Network Path not found. It won't find it by name, ip address or even by using localhost.

What could the issue be? Could this be a credential issue? I am able with my user account to open the admin share just fine. I tried turning the firewall off on that server but it didn't make a difference.

Checking the log I find the following:

Assistant: Even though you have found the root cause. There might be time-to-time difficulties if Veeam server and Hyper-V server aren't in the same domain, better to avoid it.
