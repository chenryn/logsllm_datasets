User: I'm not a great coder, in fact I'm just trying to learn, but I can't get Geany to regonise Python in my system (Windows 7) when I try to execute the program. When I click Execute, it opens a command prompt saying:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file

How can I fix this?
Assistant: I faced this issue. Added python to PATH, working fine on cmd. But Geany wasn't able to execute. Turns out, while saving the file, I had not entered .py as extension. Once I did it, worked fine.
