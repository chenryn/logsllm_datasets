To better understand the request, it seems you are asking for the pattern or template from which a specific log entry was generated. The log entry provided is as follows:

**Log Entry:**
- **Package:** `Package_for_KB3121255~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.0`
- **ApplicableState:** `112`
- **CurrentState:** `112`

The pattern or template for this log entry can be described as:

**Pattern:**
- **Package:** `<Package_ID>`
- **ApplicableState:** `<ApplicableState_Value>`
- **CurrentState:** `<CurrentState_Value>`

Where:
- `<Package_ID>` is the unique identifier for the package.
- `<ApplicableState_Value>` is the numerical value representing the applicability state of the package.
- `<CurrentState_Value>` is the numerical value representing the current state of the package.

This pattern can be used to read out the cached package applicability for any package by substituting the appropriate values into the placeholders.
