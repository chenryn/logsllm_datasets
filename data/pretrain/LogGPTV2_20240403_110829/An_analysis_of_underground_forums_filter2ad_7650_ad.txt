## Table 7: Top Three Reasons for User Bans in Each Forum

| Forum | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| BW    | Spammer (40.9%) | Duplicate account (60.7%) | Malware (30.6%) |
| CC    | Spammer (24.6%) | Malware (52.0%) | Trade-related (37.7%) |
| FH    | Duplicate account (22.7%) | Inflammatory posts (12.1%) | Spammer (16.6%) |
| HS    | Duplicate account (10.7%) | Spammer (34.7%) | Ripper (17.4%) |
| HL    | Inflammatory posts (17.0%) | Spammer (13.3%) | Duplicate account (14.1%) |
| LC    | Duplicate account (9.8%) | Ripper (22.7%) | Spammer (7.3%) |

### 6.1 Why Users are Banned

The fraction of users banned on these forums is significant. For instance, moderators on the CC forum have banned over 20% of the users listed in their members table. Given the nature of underground forums, this is not surprising. Table 7 outlines the top three reasons for bans in each forum. To generate this data, we analyzed specific tables in five forums (BW, CC, FH, HS, HL) that explicitly hold information on user bans. For LC, which lacked such a table, we analyzed warnings issued to banned users and assumed the final warning led to the ban. We created 13 categories for common ban reasons and used 35 regular expressions to categorize them. Users can be banned for multiple reasons, and not all bans are explained, so the percentages shown are based on explained bans (numbers in parentheses). These regular expressions covered over 70% of the ban reasons across the five forums.

The most common issue across forums is duplicate accounts, appearing in the top three reasons in four of the forums. Users often create duplicate accounts to circumvent previous bans. Another prevalent problem is spamming and malware attacks, particularly in BW and HS. In commerce-oriented forums like LC and CC, rippers make up over 10% of bans. Rippers are individuals who defraud other members, and threads are created to identify these users.

### 6.2 Accusers vs. Accused

We investigated the repercussions of accusing a member of being a ripper on the CC forum. We extracted all threads where a user accused another member of being a ripper. The titles of these threads often take the form "Ripper [username]". After identifying both parties, we compared their activity levels prior to the accusation. Table 8 shows the median values for several statistics about the accusers and the accused.

| Stat Name | Accuser (Banned) | Accuser (Unbanned) | Accused (Banned) | Accused (Unbanned) |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Num PMs Sent | 243.0 | 271.0 | 101.0 | 104.0 |
| Num PMs Recv | 299.5 | 500.5 | 527.0 | 34.5 |
| PM InDegree | 31.0 | 12.0 | 12.0 | 50.0 |
| PM OutDegree | 182.0 | 183.5 | 22.0 | 24.5 |
| Num Posts | 10.0 | 7.0 | 72.5 | 180.0 |
| Thread InDegree | 198.0 | 73.5 | 57.5 | 21.5 |
| Thread OutDegree | 22.0 | 21.0 | 134.0 | 333.0 |
| Total Pairs | 314 | 62 |

In cases where the accused person was ultimately banned, the accusers were much more active on the CC forum. For example, accusers had more than eight times the number of links in their PM graphs and roughly twice as many links in their thread graphs compared to the banned accused users. In cases where the accusation did not result in a ban, the accused exhibited more activity than the accusers. Unbanned accused users also had a larger number of links in their PM and thread graphs compared to their banned counterparts.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper characterizes the social network makeup of six underground forums, including how users interact, how baseline reputation is established, and how it changes over time. This work is a first step in a larger research agenda to understand the social dynamics of the underground and their impact on e-crime market efficiencies.
