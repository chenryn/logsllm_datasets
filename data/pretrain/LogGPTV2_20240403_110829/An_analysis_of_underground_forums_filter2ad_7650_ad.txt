Table 7: The top three reasons why users are banned on each of the forums.
6.1 Why Users are Banned
The fraction of users that are banned on the forums is non-trivial.
For example, the moderators on CC have banned over 20% of the
users that appear in their members table. Because the individuals
who participate in underground forums generally lack some scru-
ples, this is not surprising. Table 7 shows the top three reasons why
users are banned in the forums. To generate the data, we analyzed
a speciﬁc table in ﬁve of the forums (BW, CC, FH, HS, HL) that
explicitly holds information regarding user bans. LC did not have
such a table, so we analyzed the warnings issued to banned users
and assumed that the ﬁnal warning received by the user resulted
in the ban. Next, we created 13 categories for the most commonly
appearing banned reasons and wrote 35 regular expressions to bin
them. Again, users can be banned for multiple reasons. Also, not
every ban is explained (the reason is sometimes left blank), so the
percentages shown are with respect to the explained bans (repre-
sented by the numbers in parenthesis). These regular expressions
covered over 70% of the banned reasons across all ﬁve forums.
The most common problem across the forums involves duplicate
accounts (dup. acc), which appears in the top three reasons in four
of the forums. Users often create duplicate accounts to circumvent
a prior ban. Another problem in the forums is, ironically, spamming
and malware attacks, with BW and HS particularly inundated with
spammers. In the commerce oriented forums (LC and CC), rippers

comprise over 10% of the bans. Rippers are individuals who rip off
other members, and threads are created to identify these users.
6.2 Accusers vs. Accused
We next investigate the repercussions of accusing one member
of being a ripper on the CC forum. To do this, we extracted all the
threads where a user accused another member of being a ripper. The
titles of these threads often take the form “Ripper ”.
Once we identiﬁed both parties, we compared the amount of activ-
ity the users engaged in prior to the accusation time. Table 8 shows
the median values for several statistics about the accusers and the
accused. We see that, in the cases where the accused person was
ultimately banned, the accusers were much more active on the CC
forum. For example, accusers had more than eight times the number
of links in their PM graphs than the banned accused users, and the
accusers had roughly twice as many links in their thread graphs. In
the cases where the accusation did not result in a ban, the accused
exhibited more activity than the accusers. Also, the unbanned ac-
cused users had a larger number of links in their PM (e.g., 10 vs. 21
for PM indegree) and thread (e.g., 180 vs. 330 for thread indegree)
graphs than their banned counterparts.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper has characterized the social network makeup for six
underground forums, how users interact, how baseline reputation is
established and how it changes over time. This work is a ﬁrst step
in a larger research agenda to understand the social dynamics of the
underground and how they impact e-crime market efﬁciencies.

“An Analysis of Underground Forums” 
Authors: M. Motoyama, D. McCoy, K. Levchenko, S. Savage, G. Voelker 
is  unique  and 
is  slightly  weak  (e.g., 
this  paper  will  generate  a 
Reviewer #1 
Strengths:	This is a new, interesting direction for research. The 
dataset 
lot  of 
excitement/discussion.  
Weaknesses: The connection of the actual analysis presented to 
the  motivation 
its  different  from 
conventional OSNs, reputations, dynamics of graph). 
Comments  to  Authors:  I  would  have  liked  to  see  a  better 
analysis  of  the  following:  (1)  how  are  these  graphs  structurally 
different  from  regular  OSNs?  (2)  is  the  temporal  dynamics  of 
these  graphs  different  from  OSNs  --  e.g.,  are  there  frequent 
interactions  between  a  pair  of  entities  or  are  people  constantly 
finding new friends etc?  
You  say  the  dataset  is  “public”  --  Is  it  public  to  your  group  or 
more broadly??  
Why  are  German  forums  surprisingly  a  high  fraction  of  your 
dataset-- are underground groups more active there?  
Section  4:  I  like  how  you  break  down  relationships  based  on 
buddy/PM/thread.  I  wonder  if  the  thread  category  can  be  more 
finely  divided;  e.g.,  don’t  the  forum  posts  have  some  sort  of 
“Reply-To”  semantics  where  user  1  responds  to  user  2’s 
comments etc?  
Section  5.1:  you  claim  that  most  trading  can  be  shut  down  -- 
wouldnt the obvious response then be to create a lot of sybil-like 
proxies or pseudonyms?  
Section  5.4  --  the  majority  of  positive  ratings  makes  me  worry 
about  collusion/sybil  effects  here.  Is  it  possible  for  you  to  rule 
these out?  
Section 5.5 -- what fraction of transactions have ratings? Isnt the 
number of posts to first transaction or the time to first PM/thread 
response to trading post a more accurate measure of what you are 
trying to show here? 
Reviewer #2 
Strengths: This is the first study of the kind i have encountered. 
Moreover, the 6 datasets have sufficient differences to make the 
study interesting. 
Weaknesses: None of the results actually surprised me or stayed 
in my mind after I finished reviewing the paper (this is typically a 
bad sign in my opinion). Second, I do not really see any strong 
methodological contribution that could be the lesson learnt here. 
More importantly, the metrics studied as rarely precisely defined 
or discussed - the paper appears as a series of plots of different 
metrics. 
Comments  to  Authors:  I  wish  I  were  more  enthusiastic  about 
this work, but I am really not. I think the authors deserve credit 
for  having  looked  for  those  data  sets  and  for  having  analyzed 
them under the same lens. However, I do not really see anything 
that  exciting  coming  out  of  the  study  itself.  Moreover,  I  do  not 
really see a strong methodological contribution either.  
In  particular,  for  a  measurement paper,  the  authors  have  done a 
poor  job  describing  the  studied  metrics.  As  an  example,  section 
5.2  discusses  “the  average  social  degree  for a user after posting 
trading threads”. I would like to see the precise definition of this 
metric.  
Second,  and  given  that  this  is  a  measurement  paper  as  well,  all 
metrics that present average values should also present confidence 
intervals.  I  think  extracting  conclusions  based  on  the  average 
values alone can be very misleading.  
In summary, I do not really feel like I learnt something new from 
this paper. I would love if the authors had managed to frame the 
discussion in a more impactful way...  
More detailed comments: you talk about using regular expressions 
to identify specific categories. Those matches tend to lead to non 
100%  matches.  It  would  be  nice  to  know  what  the  remaining 
threads contained that did not match the regular expression. Have 
you looked through them? 
Reviewer #3 
Strengths: The first strength is the novelty of the paper. The second 
strength is its impact to the community. It brings knowledge about 
background economy to the network research community, hopefully 
will trigger more research in this direction. The background section 
(although  brief  --  but  this  is  a  short  paper)  provides  pointers  to 
background reading in the area, that I believe majority of network 
researchers still do not have a comprehensive understanding. 
Weaknesses: I wish the paper could go one step deeper to discuss 
how  the  results  from  this  paper  can  be  applied  to  mitigate  the 
underground problems. 
Comments to Authors: None. 
Reviewer #4 
Strengths:  Interesting  study  of  underground  forums  based  on 
complete  datasets.  Some 
interesting  observations  regarding 
banned accounts and the effect of rating. 
Weaknesses:  The  authors  claim  that  underground  forums  are 
quite different than regular ones, but never attempt to quantify or 
examine this difference. The classification of topics is based on a 
manual process. 
78Comments  to  Authors:  This  is  a  well-written  paper  examining 
underground  forums.  Overall,  I  enjoyed  reading  the  paper, 
although the analysis could go in more depth describing in more 
detail some of the findings observed.  
What I felt is definitely missing from the paper, is a comparison 
with regular forums. It is unclear to me whether characteristics are 
significantly different as the authors argue.  
In  particular,  I  would  argue  that,  intuitively,  observations  in 
section  4  do  hold  for  most  of  the  online  forums  at  least 
qualitatively.  Quantifying  the  differences  would  be  interesting 
here.  
In section 5, I found the analysis a bit incomplete. For example, 
the  authors  describe  the  number  of  PMs  after  thread  response 
versus the user degree (figure 6). However, it is hard to get any 
context  from  this  figure  without  a  similar  one  that  is  not 
conditioned  on  thread  response.  What  is  the  PMs/week  without 
thread participation? Also the figure presents averages that might 
be misleading or provide an incomplete picture. Some percentiles 
would  be  helpful.  This  is  true  for  other  figures  in  the  same 
section.  
I did not understand at all Section 5.3. Figure 7 shows that there is 
some  correlation  between  user  status  and  PMs  received  but  the 
text claims otherwise. Am I missing something here?  
I found the analysis in sections 5.5 and 6 interesting and perhaps 
the  authors  could  devote  more  space  to  these  observations. 
Section  5.5  shows  that  one  needs  significant  activity  before  a 
rating is received. Again comparison with regular forums would 
be interesting here.  
Section 6 implies that banning decisions do depend on the activity 
and social characteristics of users. Providing similar numbers as 
in Table 5 conditioning on the reason for ban would perhaps be 
interesting here. 
Reviewer #5 
Strengths:  Interesting  topic,  good  data  sets,  reasonably  good 
analysis. 
Weaknesses:  Analysis  has  limited  depth  and  merely  presented 
basic points, implications of findings are not discussed. 
Comments to Authors: I found the topic of this paper interesting 
and overall like the paper. I found it rather ironic that these forums 
are  called  underground and then such a detailed data sets of their 
transaction is available even through wikileaks. The obtained data 
sets appear to be database (or log) on the original server. It is hard to 
get  such  information  (e.g.  level  of  seniority  of  users  in  a  forum, 
number  of  private  messages,  content  of  messages,  ...)  even  for 
forums such as twitter and fb that are not underground. I found it 
intriguing  that  such  a  data  is  available  for  several  underground 
forums.  It  is  helpful  if  authors  spell  out  what  information  are 
available in these data sets in section 3. For example, availability of 
users’  level  of  seniority  and  destination  of  private  messages  (for 
later analysis in the paper) were surprise to me.  
For some of the analysis, authors come up with set of expressions 
to  classify  messages.  Is  there  a  methodology  or  known  list  for 
such  an  expression  or  authors  have  other  ways  to  define  these 
expressions?  
It  is  useful  to  have  some  explanations  on  how  the  presented 
findings  can  be  used  to  disrupt  these  venues  or  defend  against 
their attacks (or other purposes), and some minor explanation on 
how the observed behavior is different from other forums that are 
not  underground.  Of  course  such  a  discussion  should be limited 
given the length of this paper.  
It is useful if authors provide a link to their data sets on wikileaks 
so the rest of the research community can examine them. 
Response from the Authors 
The reviewers inquired about many interesting ways in which the 
analyses could be extended. We share these reactions. In the spirit 
(and  constraints)  of  short  papers,  we  view  this  paper  as 
exploratory  work  seeding  the  analysis  of  the  social  networking 
properties  of  underground  forums.  We  plan  to  expand  on  this 
topic in future, more comprehensive work. 
In  preparing 
the  camera-ready  version,  we  have  further 
emphasized  the  differences  between  the  commerce-oriented 
forums  (Carders  and  L33tCrew)  and  those  focused  primarily  on 
the exchange of information. We placed all the reciprocal degree 
distributions  for  the  underground  forums  on  the  same  graphs  to 
emphasize the structural differences between the forum types. We 
point out how the trading forums are much more interconnected 
among the different link types. Also, we have omitted statements 
about  the  differences  between  underground  and  regular  forums, 
since we do not make direct comparisons between the two types 
in this work. 
Several  reviewers  inquired  about  making  the  data  public; 
unfortunately, the data is not ours to share. As mentioned in the 
paper, however, others have leaked the data. 
One reviewer asked how we might disrupt the forums. We discuss how 
10%  of  the  traders  are  responsible  for  40-50%  of  the  goods  traded. 
Targeting the forum members with the most activity could disrupt, or at 
least impede, the marketplace. Another reviewer pointed out that traders 
can mask their activity levels by creating multiple accounts. However, 
reputation is hard to accrue, and we do not believe creating multiple 
accounts is a viable option for high volume traders. 
We  made  clarifications  where  possible,  especially  regarding  the 
metrics  we  define.  We  included  a  brief  description  of  the 
information  available  in  the  back-end  databases,  along  with 
pointers about the various packages powering each forum. 
Another  reviewer  commented  on  the  lack  of  negative  ratings. 
Many  users  with  negative  ratings  are  banned,  and  the  rest  are 
generally accused of providing ``poor’’ service. Also, we discuss 
in  Section  6  how  ripper  accusations  are  levied  against  forum 
members outside the rating system. 
Some  reviewers  commented  on  our  methodology  for classifying 
the  merchandise  being 
the 
methodology  in  the  paper.  Briefly,  we  developed  our  list  of 
regular  expressions  using  domain  knowledge,  and  by  randomly 
sampling  threads  to  capture  the  most  frequently  traded  items. 
Also, we looked at threads we did not classify under our regular 
expressions; we found a long tail of traded items.
