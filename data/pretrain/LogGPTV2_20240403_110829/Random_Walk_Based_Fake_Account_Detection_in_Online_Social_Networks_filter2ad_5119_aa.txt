Abstract—Online social networks are known to be vulnerable
to the so-called Sybil attack,
in which an attacker maintains
massive fake accounts (also called Sybils) and uses them to
perform various malicious activities. Therefore, Sybil detection
is a fundamental security research problem in online social
networks. Random walk based methods, which leverage the
structure of an online social network to distribute reputation
scores for users, have been demonstrated to be promising in
certain real-world online social networks. In particular, random
walk based methods have three desired features: they can have
theoretically guaranteed performance for online social networks
that have the fast-mixing property, they are accurate when the
social network has strong homophily property, and they can be
scalable to large-scale online social networks. However, existing
random walk based methods suffer from several key limitations:
1) they can only leverage either labeled benign users or labeled
Sybils, but not both, 2) they have limited detection accuracy for
weak-homophily social networks, and 3) they are not robust to
label noise in the training dataset.
In this work, we propose a new random walk based Sybil
detection method called SybilWalk. SybilWalk addresses the lim-
itations of existing random walk based methods while maintaining
their desired features. We perform both theoretical and empirical
evaluations to compare SybilWalk with previous random walk
based methods. Theoretically, for online social networks with
the fast-mixing property, SybilWalk has a tighter asymptotical
bound on the number of Sybils that are falsely accepted into
the social network than all existing random walk based methods.
Empirically, we compare SybilWalk with previous random walk
based methods using both social networks with synthesized Sybils
and a large-scale Twitter dataset with real Sybils. Our empirical
results demonstrate that 1) SybilWalk is substantially more
accurate than existing random walk based methods for weak-
homophily social networks, 2) SybilWalk is substantially more
robust to label noise than existing random walk based methods,
and 3) SybilWalk is as scalable as the most efﬁcient existing
random walk based methods. In particular, on the Twitter dataset,
SybilWalk achieves a false positive rate of 1.3% and a false
negative rate of 17.3%.

INTRODUCTION
Online social networks (OSNs) are important platforms for
people to interact with each other, to process information, and
to diffuse social inﬂuence. For instance, Facebook owned 1.65
billion monthly active users as of April 2016 [1]. Moreover,
according to Alexa (a web service ranking popularities of
websites) [2], Facebook was the third most visited website, just
below the giant search engine Google.com and video sharing
site Youtube.com. However, OSNs–like many other distributed
systems–are open to the so-called Sybil attacks. In a Sybil
attack, an adversary registers and maintains massive fake (or
Sybil) accounts, often using computer software. These Sybil
accounts can subvert the security and privacy of OSNs. For
instance, an attacker can use Sybils to manipulate presidential
election and stock market via fake news [3, 4], as well as
disseminate spams, phishing URLs, and malware [5]. There-
fore, Sybil detection in OSNs is a fundamental and important
security research problem.
Indeed, Sybil detection has attracted much attention from
multiple research communities including dependable systems,
cybersecurity, networking, as well as data mining. A partic-
ular category of Sybil detection methods [6–13] leverage the
structure of an OSN and distribute reputation scores to users
via random walks. We call these methods random walk based
methods. For instance, SybilRank [10] distributes benignness
scores from a set of labeled benign users to the rest of users
via a random walk, while CIA [11] distributes badness scores
from a set of labeled Sybil users to the rest of users via a
random walk. These scores can be used to classify users to be
benign or Sybil, or rank all users such that top-ranked users are
more likely to be Sybil. In practice, OSN operators often hire
human workers to manually inspect users and ﬂag Sybils. The
ranking can be used as a priority list to guide human workers
to detect Sybils more efﬁciently. Speciﬁcally, a human worker
can only inspect a limited number of Sybils within a given
time period. Therefore, inspecting the top ranked users in the
priority list can help human workers detect more Sybils within
the same period of time.
Random walk based methods have demonstrated promis-
ing results in certain real-world OSNs [10, 12]. Speciﬁcally,
random walk based methods have three promising features.
First, for OSNs that have the fast-mixing property, some
random walk based methods have theoretically guaranteed
performance. For instance, SybilRank guarantees that
the
number of Sybils that are ranked lower than certain benign
users is asymptotically bounded as O(g log n), where g is
the number of attack edges (an edge is an attack edge if
it connects a benign user and a Sybil user) and n is the
number of users in the OSN. Second, for OSNs that have a
strong homophily property, random walk based methods can
accurately detect Sybils. An OSN has a strong homophily
property if any two linked users are highly likely to have the
same label. For instance, SybilRank [10] can accurately detect
top-ranked Sybils in Tuenti, the largest OSN in Spain that has
the homophily property. Third, state-of-the-art random walk
based methods are scalable to large-scale OSNs.
However, existing random walk based methods suffer from
several key limitations: 1) they only leverage either labeled
benign users or labeled Sybils, but not both, 2) they have lim-
ited detection accuracy for weak-homophily social networks

(many OSNs have weak homophily), and 3) they are not robust
to label noise in the training dataset. For instance, we will
demonstrate that SybilRank and CIA have limited detection
accuracy on a Twitter network that has a weak homophily.
Our work:
In this work, we propose SybilWalk, a new ran-
dom walk based method, to perform Sybil detection in OSNs.
SybilWalk overcomes the limitations of existing random walk
based methods while maintaining their advantages. Speciﬁ-
cally, given a social graph, we augment the graph with two
additional nodes. The two nodes represent the two labels, i.e.,
benign or Sybil; and we call them benign label node (denoted
as lb) and Sybil label node (denoted as ls), respectively. Given
a training dataset, we create an edge between each labeled
benign node and lb, and we create an edge between each
labeled Sybil node and ls. Then, for each remaining node, we
start a random walk from the node; and we treat the probability
that this random walk reaches ls before reaching lb as the
badness score for the node. A larger badness score indicates a
higher likelihood of being a Sybil. Finally, SybilWalk uses the
badness scores to classify users or rank them to be a priority
list. The intuition of SybilWalk is that a node is more likely
to be a Sybil if it is structurally closer to the labeled Sybils
than the labeled benign nodes in the OSN.
Computing the badness scores deﬁned by our SybilWalk
is non-trivial. For instance, one way to compute the badness
score for a node is to simulate r random walks that all start
from the node. If rs of them reach ls before reaching lb, then
we can approximate the badness score as rs/r. However, this
method is inefﬁcient, because 1) we often need to simulate a
large number of random walks in order to obtain a conﬁdent
approximate of the badness score, and 2) we need to simulate
random walks for each node. To address the challenge, we
design an iterative method to efﬁciently compute the badness
scores. Our method computes the exact badness scores and
computes them for all nodes simultaneously.
We compare SybilWalk with previous random walk based
methods both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, for
OSNs that are fast mixing, we show that SybilWalk can bound
the number of Sybils, whose badness scores are lower than
certain benign nodes, to be O(g log n/d(s)), where g is the
number of attack edges, n is the number of users, and d(s) is
the average number of Sybils that a Sybil node is connected
to. A larger d(s) indicates more dense connections between
Sybil nodes. In contrast, the tightest bound of existing random
walk based methods is O(g log n) [7, 10]. Moreover, we
demonstrate that SybilWalk has almost the same computational
complexity as the most efﬁcient existing random walk based
methods.
Empirically, we compare SybilWalk with SybilRank and
CIA using 1) social networks with synthesized Sybils and
2) a large-scale Twitter network with real Sybils. Our results
demonstrate that 1) SybilWalk is substantially more accurate
than SybilRank and CIA when the social network has weak
homophily, 2) SybilWalk is substantially more robust to label
noises than SybilRank and CIA, and 3) SybilWalk is as
scalable as SybilRank and CIA. For instance, on the Twitter
dataset, in the ranking list produced by SybilWalk, 99% of
the top-80,000 nodes are Sybils. However, in the ranking lists
produced by SybilRank and CIA, only 0.3% and 30% are
Sybils, respectively.
SybilWalk to detect Sybils in OSNs.
In summary, our key contributions are as follows:
• We propose a new random walk based method called
• We theoretically analyze the performance of Sybil-
Walk. SybilWalk achieves a tighter bound on the
number of falsely accepted Sybils than all existing
random walk based methods.
• We empirically compare SybilWalk with existing ran-
dom walk based methods on both social networks
with synthesized Sybils and a Twitter dataset with
real Sybils. Our results demonstrate that SybilWalk
is more accurate and more robust to label noises than
existing random walk based methods, while it is as
scalable as the most efﬁcient existing random walk
based methods.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Random Walk based Methods
Random walk based methods aim to leverage social struc-
ture [6–13]. The key intuition is that, although an attacker can
control the connections between Sybils arbitrarily, it is harder
for the attacker to manipulate the connections between benign
nodes and Sybils, because such manipulation requires actions
from benign nodes. Therefore, there is a structural gap between
benign nodes and Sybils. Random walk based methods aim to
leverage such structural gap.
Inference Algorithm (CIA)
Example random walk based methods include Sybil-
Guard [6], SybilLimit [7], SybilInfer [8], SybilRank [10],
Criminal account
[11], and
´Integro [12]. Speciﬁcally, SybilGuard [6] and SybilLimit [7]
assume that it is easy for short random walks starting from
a labeled benign user to quickly reach other benign users,
while hard for short random walks starting from Sybils to
reach benign users. SybilGuard and SybilLimit use the same
random walk lengths for all nodes. SmartWalk [13] leverages
machine learning classiﬁers to predict the appropriate random
walk length for different nodes, and can improve the perfor-
mance of SybilLimit via using the predicted (different) random
walk length for each node. SybilInfer [8] combines random
walks with Bayesian inference and Monte-Carlo sampling to
directly detect the bottleneck cut between benign users and
Sybils. SybilRank [10] uses short random walks to distribute
benignness scores from a set of labeled benign users to all the
remaining users. CIA [11] distributes badness scores from a
set of labeled Sybils to other users. With a certain probability,
CIA restarts the random walk from the initial probability
distribution, which is assigned based on the set of labeled
Sybils. ´Integro [12] improves SybilRank by ﬁrst leveraging
victim prediction (a victim is a user that connects to at least
one Sybil) to assign weights to edges of a social network and
then performing random walks on the weighted social network.
All existing random walk based methods require 1) the
OSN (in particular the benign region) is fast mixing, which
roughly means that a random walk in the OSN will converge
to its stationary probability distribution quickly; and 2) the
OSN has a strong homophily property, which means that if
we sample an edge from the OSN uniformly at random, then
the two corresponding nodes have the same label with a high

probability. An OSN is said to have a weaker homophily if
the two nodes of the sampled edge have the same label with
a smaller probability. ´Integro further requires the number of
victims to be small.
Existing random walk based methods suffer from several
key limitations: 1) they can only leverage either labeled benign
users or labeled Sybils, but not both, 2) they have limited
detection accuracy for weak-homophily social networks, and 3)
they are not robust to label noise in the training dataset. Specif-
ically, SybilGuard, SybilLimit, SybilInfer, and SmartWalk only
leverage one labeled benign node, making their performance
limited [10] and them not robust to label noise. Moreover,
they are not scalable to large-scale OSNs because they need
to simulate a large number of random walks. SybilRank and
´Integro were successfully applied to detect a large amount of
Sybils in Tuenti, the largest OSN in Spain. The reason of such
success is that Tuenti has a strong homophily property [10].
However, they can only leverage the labeled benign users
in the training dataset, limiting their performance in weak-
homophily OSNs, as we will demonstrate in our experiments.
CIA only leverages labeled Sybils. As we will demonstrate in
our experiments, CIA also achieves limited performance for
weak-homophily OSNs and is not robust to label noises. Our
new random walk based method can tolerate a much weaker
homophily and is more robust to label noises than existing
ones.
Summary: Existing random walk based methods 1) can only
leverage either labeled benign users or labeled Sybils, but not
both, 2) have limited detection accuracy for weak-homophily
social networks, and 3) are not robust to label noise in the
training dataset.
B. Markov Random Fields based Methods
Markov Random Fields (MRF) based methods also lever-
age the structure of the OSN [14–17]. In particular, Sybil-
Belief [14] associates a binary random variable with each
node in the OSN; a random variable has a value of 1 if the
corresponding node is Sybil, otherwise the random variable has
a value of -1. Then, SybilBelief models the joint probability
distribution of all these binary random variables as a pairwise
Markov Random Field. Given a set of labeled benign nodes
and (optionally) a set of labeled Sybil nodes, SybilBelief esti-
mates the conditional probability of being Sybil for each node
via the standard Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) method [18].
The conditional probabilities are then used to detect Sybils.
Gao et al. [15] and Fu et al. [16] demonstrated that SybilBelief
can achieve better performance when learning the node and
edge priors using local graph structure analysis. SybilBelief
and its variants are not scalable. Moreover, they are iterative
algorithms, but the iterative processes are not guaranteed to
converge. The fundamental reason is that they rely on LBP
to perform inference, which maintains messages on edges
(so it is not scalable) and is not guaranteed to converge on
loopy graphs [18]. Wang et al. [17] proposed SybilSCAR, a
general framework to unify random walk based methods and
MRF based methods. SybilSCAR is much more scalable than
SybilBelief and is guaranteed to converge.
Summary: The key limitation of MRF based methods is that
they do not have theoretical guarantees on the number of Sybils
that can be falsely accepted into an OSN. We believe it is an
interesting future work to generalize our theoretical analysis
to derive guarantees for MRF based methods.
C. Other Methods
Other Sybil detection methods aim to leverage a user’s
content, a user’s behavior, as well as a user’s local graph
structure (i.e., friends and connections between them) [5, 19–
28]. For instance, contents could be tweets and hashtags
on Twitter, news feeds and wall posts on Facebook, and
clickstreams (e.g., a sequence of HTTP/HTTPS requests made
by users). User behaviors could be the frequency of sending
tweets on Twitter. These approaches span a variety of schemes,
including blacklisting, whitelisting, URL ﬁltering, as well
as machine learning methods. In particular, most studies in
this direction [5, 19–22, 24, 27] treat Sybil detection as a
supervised learning problem; they extract various features from
user-generated contents, behaviors, and local graph structure,
and then learn machine learning classiﬁers using a training
dataset consisting of a large number of labeled benign users
and Sybils; the learnt classiﬁers are then used to predict the
label (i.e., benign or Sybil) of each remaining user. The major
challenge of these approaches is that attackers can mimic
benign users and produce similar content, behavior, and local
graph structure, making these methods less effective.
Summary: Attackers can easily evade the methods that use
content, behavior, or local graph structure.
III. PROBLEM DEFINITION
We formally deﬁne our structure-based Sybil detection
problem, introduce our design goals, and describe the threat
model we consider in the paper.
A. Structure-based Sybil Detection
Suppose we are given an OSN G = (V, E), where a
node v ∈ V represents a user and an edge (u, v) ∈ E
indicates a mutual relationship between u and v. For instance,
on Facebook, an edge (u, v) could mean that u is in v’s friend
list and vice versa. On Twitter, an edge (u, v) could mean that
u and v follow each other. In the OSN, each user has a label,
which can be benign or Sybil. We say a user is labeled if we
already know its label, e.g., via manual inspection, otherwise
