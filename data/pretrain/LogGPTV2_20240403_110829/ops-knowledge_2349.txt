User: What is the correct process for having logrotate manage files written to by the python logging module? Usually I would use a WatchedFileHandler but I need to target 2.4, which does not have this class. Is there a function in the logging module which i can attach to a HUP handler, perhaps, to have it reopen the logfile?
Assistant: I would advise that you copy the source of WatchedFileHandler from a later version and adapt it, if needed, so that it works on 2.4.
