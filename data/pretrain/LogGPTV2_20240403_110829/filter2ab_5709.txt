**ATT&CK ID:** T1218.010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Regsvr32

**Description:**

Adversaries may exploit the `regsvr32.exe` utility to execute malicious code indirectly. `Regsvr32.exe` is a command-line tool designed for registering and unregistering Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. This utility can also be used to load and execute scripts from remote servers, which can be leveraged by attackers to bypass application whitelisting or other security measures. Additionally, the `regsvr32.exe` binary is typically signed by Microsoft, making it appear more trustworthy and potentially evading detection by security software.

**Key Points:**
- **Purpose:** Register and unregister OLE controls and DLLs.
- **Potential Misuse:** Proxy execution of malicious code or scripts.
- **Security Implications:** Can be used to bypass security controls and evade detection due to its trusted signature.
