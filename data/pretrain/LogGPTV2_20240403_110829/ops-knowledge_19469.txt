To effectively implement CIS Control 8.9, which focuses on centralizing audit logs, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Centralize Audit Log Collection:**
   - Consolidate audit logs from all enterprise assets, including servers, workstations, network devices, and applications, into a single, centralized log management system.
   - Ensure that the centralized system is capable of handling the volume and variety of log data generated across the organization.

2. **Standardize Log Formats:**
   - Adopt a standardized format for log data to facilitate easier analysis and correlation. Common formats include Syslog, JSON, or a custom schema that meets the organization's specific needs.

3. **Implement Robust Retention Policies:**
   - Define and enforce retention policies that comply with regulatory requirements and organizational needs. This includes determining how long logs should be retained and the conditions under which they can be deleted or archived.

4. **Ensure Security and Integrity:**
   - Protect the centralized log management system with strong access controls, encryption, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
   - Implement mechanisms to ensure the integrity of log data, such as digital signatures or hash functions.

5. **Monitor and Analyze Logs:**
   - Regularly monitor and analyze the collected logs to detect and respond to security incidents in a timely manner.
   - Use automated tools and analytics to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential threats.

6. **Compliance and Reporting:**
   - Ensure that the centralized log management system supports compliance with relevant regulations and standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.
   - Generate regular reports and alerts to provide visibility into the organization's security posture and to meet audit and compliance requirements.

CIS Control 8.9 is categorized under the "Network" asset type and falls under the "Detect" security function, making it a critical component of an organization's overall security strategy.
