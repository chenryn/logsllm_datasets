### 5.1 Participant Characteristics

Our study recruited 18 participants online [13, 17]. The study provides concrete numbers and extends existing literature by highlighting that:

1. ASO workers can be hybrid (e.g., both organic and sockpuppet masters).
2. Product developers can hire multiple types of expert ASO workers to promote their products.

Participants reported charging between $0.5 and $6 per posted review (mean = $2.16, standard deviation = $1.86). They claimed to have between 1 and 6 years of experience in ASO jobs (mean = 3.03 years, standard deviation = 1.53 years). During this time, they claimed to have worked on between 150 and 4,000 apps in total, and between 6 and 50–60 apps in the past month (mean = 34.11 apps, standard deviation = 18.37 apps). Their educational backgrounds were diverse, including 2 master's degrees, 11 completed bachelor's degrees, 2 ongoing bachelor's degrees, and 4 high school graduates.

### 5.2 Fraud Capabilities and Expertise

The middle columns of Table 1 list the number of user accounts controlled by or accessible to each participant. Most participants control a few hundred accounts, but some control several thousand. For example, P13 claimed to be part of a team of 13 workers who control 80,000 accounts. Seven participants, each controlling thousands of accounts, also claimed to be able to write an "unlimited" number of reviews for a single app, more than the developer could request or afford. The other 11 participants, with up to 3,000 accounts, claimed to write a number of reviews consistent with the number of accounts they control.

To provide context, Figure 4 shows the number of accounts revealed and the number of unique apps reviewed from those accounts by each participant in our quantitative study (§ 4.2). We crawled information from 1,164 accounts and 6,362 unique apps. One participant (F18) revealed 83 accounts, and F35 reviewed 927 unique apps from 42 accounts.

### 5.3 Hardware: Devices

All interview participants claimed to own or have access to multiple mobile devices. The last columns of Table 1 list the number and types of devices controlled or accessible by each participant. Nine participants claimed to post fraud from mobile devices, and 11 participants said this also happens from the mobile devices of organic ASO workers they control. Two participants, such as P13, use emulators running on laptops, e.g., BlueStacks [5], to install and review apps.

P8 and P18 have an almost 1-to-1 account-to-device mapping. Participants like P2, P3, P7, P10, and P15 have a small many-to-one mapping, e.g., up to 7 accounts per device. Others, such as P1 and P13, claim to have significantly more accounts than devices (e.g., 15,000:300 and 80,000:30, respectively).

**Mobile Device Models:**
Several participants claim access to communities of organic users, providing a diverse set of devices. Four participants (P1, P10, P11, P13) owned only low-end, cheap devices. Others (P7, P15, P16) owned a mix of low, medium, and high-end devices, dominated by low-end devices. For instance, P7, who claimed to own more than 1,000 devices, said, “We try to choose cheap devices with more features and memory, but we also have high-end phones like Nokia, Samsung, which we need to review virtual/augmented reality apps.”

**Device Source:**
Most participants purchased their devices on the regular market. However, P11 said, “I have bought them from the black market at a very low price.” P18 claimed to run a mobile device repair shop and use the devices he is supposed to repair to write reviews.

**Device Storage:**
Six participants stored the devices on a table, easily accessible. P1 stored the devices in a separate room. P7 said, “The department handling reviews and installs is on a different floor, and high-end phones are kept in the locker after use for safety.” P7 also mentioned having a dedicated team to manage all devices, charging each device every 2–3 days and keeping them on during office hours, switching them off after 11 pm–midnight.

**App-Device Compatibility Issues:**
When asked about promoting apps incompatible with their devices, nine participants (P5, P6, P8, P10, P11, P13, P14, P16, P17) said it never happened. P7 runs campaigns to recruit ASO workers with compatible devices or purchases such devices. P9 and P15 provide as many reviews as possible from compatible devices and contact the developer to explain the problem. P12 skips the job.

**Quantitative Investigation:**
Using the technique described in § 4.2, we found 344 unique device models used to post 9,942 of the 21,767 reviews from the accounts controlled by 39 participants. Twelve participants posted reviews from at least 20 different device models; F35 used at least 84 distinct device models. Participants F9, F10, F14, F16, F17, and F27 posted reviews only from unknown devices, which include Google Play’s website interface and certain types of emulators.

Figure 5 shows the relationship between the device release price (in Euros) and the device model age at posting time for 9,942 presumed fake reviews from 344 unique device models. We classify devices as low, mid, or high-end based on their release price: [0, 260), [260, 450), and [450, ∞) respectively [87]. Device model age is classified as Fresh (<18 months) or Old (≥18 months). We found that 61.3% of reviews were posted from low-end, 38.2% from mid-end, and 0.5% from high-end devices, while 77.39% are from old and 19.66% from new models. Most reviews were written from old low-end (45.98%) and old mid-end (31.41%) devices.

A notable case is the use of tablets given away (price 0EUR) by the Uruguayan government to students as part of an inclusion plan named Plan Ceibal [15]. Participants F25 and F32 used this device model to write 159 reviews for 137 apps. Additionally, 3 reviews were posted from Galaxy S9+ devices priced over 600EUR.

Figure 6 shows the per-worker distribution of the "age" of devices used to post reviews. Thirteen ASO workers posted at least 100 reviews from devices over 6 months old. F13, F24, F25, F32, F33, and F35 posted at least 30 reviews from devices less than 6 months old. We conclude that different workers rely on stocks of either old devices, new devices, or a mix of old and new to post fraud.

Figure 7(a) displays the number of unique device models used by ASO workers, including the "unknown" category. While F35 used 85 unique device models, participants F9, F10, F14, F16, F17, and F27 posted all their reviews from unknown devices. Figure 7(b) shows the popularity of device models used by the 39 participants, with the top 6 most used devices being Galaxy Note 2 (836 reviews), Nexus 5 (742), Galaxy S4 (496), S5 (447), S2 (247), and Nexus 7 (241). Figure 7(c) shows the popularity of the top 15 most popular devices out of 11,934, used to post 198,466,139 reviews in Google Play.

### Summary
We found ASO workers who claim to have access to a large number of devices, either owned or accessed through their communities of organic fraud. This claim is partially confirmed through our gold standard fraud data. Both in interviews and the quantitative study, we found that ASO workers have a diverse stock of low to high-end and new to old devices. Participants with many devices reported streamlined solutions to manage them, while those with fewer devices reported ways around cost limitations and compatibility issues, e.g., further outsourcing jobs.

### 5.4 Software

**Team Formation:**
Ten interview participants (P3, P5, P6, P8, P9, P11, P12, P14, P17, P18) used Facebook and/or WhatsApp to create online teams. For example, P6 said, “I have a Facebook group of more than 500 people, collected from various freelance groups in Facebook.” P9 mentioned eligibility criteria: “To build a team, we first post a message in Facebook groups, then contact those who respond personally, and talk to them. We then decide if each is eligible, then we include him in our Facebook group.” P17 claimed access to multiple groups: “We have 20 groups of real users in WhatsApp.”

**Team Communications:**
For communications, the above 10 participants used Facebook and WhatsApp messenger apps. P6 said, “I post the app link in my Facebook group and ask them to download and post reviews.” P11 said, “When I get a job, I send them messages in WhatsApp or reach them personally.” P7, however, claimed to use specialized software: “We have our own system where we push the apps. Users who use our system get notifications about the new task and once they complete the task, they get paid. Due to privacy policy, I can’t disclose the system name.”

**Account Maintenance:**
Five interview participants (P1, P11, P13, P15, P16) said they access their accounts regularly. Twelve participants said they access them manually. Three participants (P13, P15, P16) used scripts and automatic login systems to periodically access their accounts, keep them alive, and report if any are inaccessible. For instance, P13 said, “We have built a system in Linux where if we input 100 accounts, the system automatically logs into those accounts and keeps them alive.” Participants organizing organic users said that organic users access their accounts regularly.

**Job Automation:**
P6 said, “We can post reviews, ratings, and installs using bots if the client has no problem. The bot names are like QZ362, YNX32, or something like these.” All other participants said they write their reviews manually and do not use any script for this purpose.

### 5.5 Techniques: The Art of Evasion

**Awareness of Fraud Detection:**
All interview participants are aware of their fake reviews being detected and deleted. They reported that Google deleted some of their reviews. Although most reported deletion as a small or negligible percentage (under 5%) of all the reviews they posted, four participants said 10–20% of their reviews were deleted. P6 said the review deletion percentage depends on the app and ranges from 2% to 30%. Most participants said it is very infrequent for their accounts to be deleted. P2 said, “Sometimes the email might be disabled; in that case, the review will still be shown as written by a Google User.”

**Perceived Reasons for Deletion:**
Participants reported diverse reasons for deletion:
- **Device Reuse:** P5 and P10 blamed it on using the same device to write multiple reviews for an app. P5 said, “I always track the screenshot that my workers provide as work proof. If I see two or more reviews from one worker have been deleted, I am pretty sure that they have used the same device.”

This structured and detailed approach ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the text.
