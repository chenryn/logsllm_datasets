Assistant: Here are some possible solutions to ensure sufficient disk space on the server and keep performance unaffected: 1. Regularly clean up and delete unnecessary files and log files to free up disk space. 2. Perform regular disk space analysis and archive or compress files as needed to free up disk space. 3. Adjust the log level and reduce log records to reduce disk space usage. 4. Install and configure disk management tools to optimize disk space usage and performance. 5. Expand the disk space capacity or increase the number of disks. 6. Using cloud storage services, migrate unnecessary files to cloud storage and access and download them when needed. 7. Optimize and compress the database to free up disk space and improve performance. 8. Limit the file upload size and set the file storage period to avoid disk space being filled up. The above solutions are for reference only, and the specific solutions should be comprehensively considered and optimized according to the actual situation.
