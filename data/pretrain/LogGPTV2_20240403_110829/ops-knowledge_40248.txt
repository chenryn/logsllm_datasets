User: The code management tool we use in development is Git, and sometimes there are code conflicts in our team. Please explain the possible reasons for the conflict and propose corresponding solutions.
Assistant: Possible reasons for conflicts: 1. Modifying the same part of the same file. 2. Different modifications are made on the same line of code. 3. A conflict occurred when merging different commits of the same branch. Corresponding handling methods: 1. Communicate with team members in a timely manner, and try to avoid modifying the same part of the same file during cooperative development to reduce the possibility of conflicts. 2. When modifying the code, try to avoid modifying the same code line, and try to modify it on different code lines. 3. When merging branches, pull the latest modification first, and then merge to avoid conflicts caused by multiple people making a lot of changes to the same file. If a conflict has already occurred, it can be resolved in the following ways: 1. Manually merge the code: compare the code in the two versions, manually modify it if necessary, and finally submit a new merged version. 2. Abandon the local modification: If you find that your modification conflicts with other team members and your own modification is not very important, you can cancel the local modification and make modifications based on the submissions of other team members. 3. Create a new branch based on a certain version and rewrite the code: If the conflict cannot be resolved, you can create a new branch from a certain version and rewrite the code, and then merge the branch into the main branch.
