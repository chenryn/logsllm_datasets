### Bug Analysis and Reproduction

**Listing 5: NULL Pointer Dereference**
- **Bug Description:** A kernel NULL pointer dereference was identified.
- **RIP (Instruction Pointer):** 
  - `0x0010: _nv018026rm +0x158/0x1520 [nvidia]`
- **Address:** `0000000000000008`

**Listing 6: KASAN Use-After-Free**
- **Bug Description:** KASAN (Kernel Address Sanitizer) detected a use-after-free error.
- **Details:**
  - **Read of size 8 at addr:** `ffff88801e835380` by task `crash/369`
  - **Function:** `nv_match_dev_state +0x124/0x130 [nvidia]`

### Experiment and Reproduction
Excerpts from the kernel logs are provided in Listing 5 and Listing 6. Syzkaller successfully reproduced the crashes and generated minimized C programs to trigger these bugs. We tested these reproducers on the host system with the physical hardware device present and verified them.

- **Impact of NULL Pointer Dereference Bug:**
  - The bug causes the operating system to crash, necessitating a reboot for recovery.
  - This bug is not exploitable for privilege escalation but can be used to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

### FreeBSD Setup and Testing
- **Environment:**
  - FreeBSD version: 12.2-RELEASE
  - NVIDIA driver version: 460.56
- **Observations:**
  - The driver package for FreeBSD contains the same binary blobs as the Linux driver package, allowing us to reuse the Syzkaller descriptions created for Linux.
  - Syzkaller triggered the identical NULL pointer dereference bug found in the Linux kernel driver, as shown in Listing 5.

### Windows Setup and Testing
- **Environment:**
  - NVIDIA kernel driver version: 461.72
  - Driver file: `nvlddmkm.sys`
- **Setup:**
  - The BSOD-AFL approach was applied without any required adaptations, demonstrating the independence of the target operating system.
  - A simple target-specific harness was created for the Windows operating system, targeting the device node accessed via `DeviceIoControl`.
- **Fuzzing Process:**
  - Captured typical data inputs using an exemplary application that accesses the device.
  - Used these data as input seeds for AFL.
  - Fuzzing was performed with the physical hardware device in a single guest with all four available cores, achieving a mean execution speed of 10.7k execs/s.
  - A bug was uncovered after about 45 minutes, causing a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD).
  - The fault was classified as a NULL pointer dereference bug, triggered by a single ioctl call.
  - Manually reduced the input to create a reproducer.

### Bug Persistence and Re-triggering
- **Initial Trigger:**
  - The bug was initially triggered in driver version 441.12.
  - After updating to version 456.71, the input no longer caused a crash.
- **Re-triggering:**
  - When fuzzing was resumed with the crashing input added to the initial seeds, the bug re-triggered within seconds.
  - The new crashing input differed by a single increased byte value and was still present in the most recent driver version.

### Avoiding Repeated Crashes
- **Blocklisting:**
  - To avoid triggering the same bug multiple times, the respective combination of bytes was blocklisted.
- **Path Exploration:**
  - Figure 16 shows the explored paths over time during the experiment.

### Conclusion
- **Findings:**
  - The NULL pointer dereference bugs are not exploitable for privilege escalation but can cause a DoS.
  - Both approaches (BSOD-AFL and Syzkaller) successfully found real existing bugs in closed-source kernel drivers, answering the initial question.
