I am using the App Engine Launcher on Windows, and for some reason, the last time I deployed my application, the transaction did not complete. Now, every time I try to deploy, I receive the following error:

"Another transaction by user is already in progress for app: s~myapp, version 1."

To resolve this, I have tried the following steps:

1. Running `appcfg.py rollback`, which opens a Python window that closes almost immediately. It seems to display an error message, but it closes too quickly for me to read it.

2. Running `appcfg.py rollback C:\my\apps\directory\path`, which results in the same behavior as above.

3. Running `C:\Program Files\Google\google_appengine\appcfg.py rollback C:\my\app\path`, but Windows then tells me it cannot find `C:\Program`.

At this point, I am unsure of what else to try.

### Suggested Solution

The correct command to use is:
```sh
appcfg.py rollback C:\path\to\my\app
```

If you are using Java, the rollback command remains the same, but the path should point to the application's target directory. If the path is incorrect, the rollback will fail.

Please ensure that the paths you provide are accurate and that there are no spaces or typos. Additionally, make sure that the `appcfg.py` script is correctly located in the `C:\Program Files\Google\google_appengine` directory.
