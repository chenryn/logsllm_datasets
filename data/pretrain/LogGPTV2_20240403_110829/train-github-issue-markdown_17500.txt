# Steps to reproduce
Snap Explorer.exe to a new zone, eventually the files and folders stop showing
up. Sometimes the toolbar disappears. Happens to 3rd party tools such as
explore++ as well. The hidden files and folders does not happen if the file
explorer window is not snapped to a "fancy zone".
# Expected behavior
Powertoys 0.13.0.0 does not exhibit the hiding behavior in explorer.exe, you
can always see your files and folders regardless of snap position / screen.
# Actual behavior
Hidden files and folders in file explorer making selecting a file impossible.
# Screenshots
