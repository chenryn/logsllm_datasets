 Mostly focus on malware
 Probably younger than
you think
 I want to hack a human
one day (judge all you
want)

Determine precise location and orientation through
microphone-embedded devices [without consent]
Individual Profling

FIRST THING TO REMEMBER

AI is NOT Attackproof
(I‘m sure you know this) 
2020
AI is NOT Attackproof
 „Attack“ isn‘t limited to
using AI as a weapon

 „Attack“ can mean attacks
targetted towards AI

 Accidentally joining an AI-based IDS research group
drags you into things

 Saying you‘re interested in malware makes people
think you write it for fun (and no proft)

 Saying you‘re interested in malware makes people
think you write it for fun (and no proft)
 So you‘re put in the attack/testing team

 What else is can be treated in a similar manner?

Tricking AI in Practice

 The Overlaps
 You might notice overlaps between attack and defense
 Like any other tool, AI can be used on both ends of the
spectrum, sometimes without much modifcation
