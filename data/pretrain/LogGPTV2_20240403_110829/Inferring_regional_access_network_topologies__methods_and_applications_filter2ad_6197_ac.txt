tend to cover more geographic area than the Comcast regions; e.g.,
Charter’s Midwest region appears to touch 10 different U.S. states.
Thus, a Charter region contains far more COs than a Comcast
region (Fig. 7a). Charter also uses more aggregation, and far more
AggCOs per region (Fig. 7b), than Comcast, where we define an
AggCO as any CO with outgoing edges.
Fig. 8 and Table 1 show the different types of aggregation we
observed in Comcast and Charter. The smaller regions often used
a single AggCO, small to mid-size regions used two AggCOs for
greater redundancy, and the largest regions used multi-layer ag-
gregation where lower aggregation levels might include one or
two AggCOs. In the multi-layer topologies, Comcast nearly always
connects EdgeCOs to multiple AggCOs, while Charter uses a mix.
Charter’s choices in aggregation lead to less redundancy to the
EdgeCOs than in Comcast; 37.7% of EdgeCOs in Charter connect
to only one upstream CO vs 11.4% in Comcast (see Appendix B.4
for important context).
Outside of one Charter region and one Comcast region, the dif-
ference in region size does not appear to manifest in greater entry
points per regions. In §5.5, we find higher latency to the COs in
the Charter regions, likely due to the combination of fewer en-
tries per EdgeCOs and more aggregation lengthening the distance

missing or superfluous. Importantly for our analysis, the operator
confirmed that the Charter regions are vast, with layers of fiber
rings with their own AggCOs.
We confirmed with both operators that they use fiber rings with
star topologies—separate fiber pairs from AggCOs to EdgeCOs—
as we inferred in §5.2.1, rather than a ring topology. One network
operator informed us that they chose this physical topology because
it makes network upgrades simpler. We also asked both operators if
the regions contain backup paths that traceroute might not observe.
Both operators confirmed that all paths and COs are active, and
cited the prohibitive cost of maintaining backup fiber paths or COs
as the reason. This implies that traceroute can reveal all of the paths
through the regional network, provided the VPs can exhaust the
possible entries into the region.
5.5 Impact of Aggregation on Latency
The regional topologies help us better understand the inherent
latency limitations imposed by the location of entry points and the
aggregation in the regional topologies. To observe RTTs to different
EdgeCOs, we conducted 100 pings from a virtual machine (VM) in
every U.S. cloud region for Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and
Google Cloud to every EdgeCO IP address included in our graphs.
Then, we identified the closest location with the lowest minimum
RTT to the highest number of EdgeCOs in a region.
Fig. 9 provides the median of the minimum RTTs from the clouds
to Comcast EdgeCOs in four states in the Northeast U.S.; in all three
clouds the closest location was in Northern Virginia. Massachusetts,
Vermont, and New Hampshire all use the same AggCOs in the
Boston area, connected to BackboneCOs in New Jersey and New
York, and a special purpose PoP in Boston. Surprisingly, although
Connecticut is geographically closer to Northern Virginia than
the other states, it has worse latency than Massachusetts and New
Hampshire. The reason is that the Connecticut regional network
does not have its own backbone entries; instead, its AggCOs connect
to the backbone through the Massachusetts AggCOs, resulting in a
3.5 ms to 4 ms RTT penalty.
While the aggregation tends to increase latency to EdgeCOs, it
presents opportunities to to bring cloud applications closer to users
without placing edge computing infrastructure in every EdgeCO.
Conventional wisdom holds that certain classes of applications,
such as augmented or virtual reality, require less than 5 ms of

from the backbone to EdgeCOs. The fewer entries, additional ag-
gregation, and less redundancy to the EdgeCOs that we observe in
Charter could also increase the potential points of failure that could
disconnect EdgeCOs, and customers connected to those EdgeCOs.
5.4 Validating with Network Operators
We spoke with a network operator at Comcast and an operator at
Charter to discuss our topology graphs and interpretations. The
two people we spoke to are not experts for each region in their
networks, however, both Comcast and Charter use a rough template
for all of their regions, with AggCOs connected to EdgeCOs via
fiber rings, and use similar technologies in each region.
The Comcast operator had extensive knowledge of one of the
largest Comcast regions. We showed the operator our graph of
that region, along with a list of the COs that we discovered, and
the backbone entries. The operator confirmed that our inferred
graph of the region was correct; the graph contained the COs,
the second region with its own AggCOs that connect to the first
region’s AggCOs but not to the backbone, and the correct PoPs
connected to the AggCOs. Finally, the operator confirmed that the
largest Comcast regions often have two sets of AggCOs—one set
connected to the backbone and another set connected to the first
set—where each set connects to different EdgeCOs.
The Charter operator was not an expert for any specific Charter
regions, but understood their design and general topology from
the operator’s experience with the Charter backbone. The operator
thought we provided a reasonable representation of the regions
and the regional topologies, but could not indicate if any COs were

of the Charter EdgeCOs have an RTT greater than 5 ms (Fig. 10a)
from the nearest cloud location. One approach is to push edge
computing to the EdgeCOs, ensuring nearly all users are within
the latency constraints, but increasing the cost and complexity of
deployment. Another approach could exploit the hierarchy in the
regional topologies and place the edge computing infrastructure
in the AggCOs. Counting any CO with an outgoing edge as an
AggCO, we observe 7.7x as many EdgeCOs as AggCOs across all
regions of Comcast and Charter. More than 80% of the EdgeCOs for
Comcast and Charter are within 5 ms RTT of the AggCOs, likely
bringing the vast majority of regional network customers within
the 5 ms requirement (Fig. 10b). Furthermore, the AggCOs are often
substantial datacenters, with the security, power, and capacity to
include edge computing infrastructure, while EdgeCOs might be
houses on residential streets (Fig. 11).
6 CASE STUDY: AT&T
Next, we investigate the topology of AT&T’s wireline regional ac-
cess networks (Fig. 12). Compared to the cable providers AT&T’s
network is relatively opaque. AT&T provides rDNS for their Back-
boneCO routers but not for other CO routers, and provides rDNS
that identify their last-mile IP-DSLAMs and ONTs. However, there
is no straight-forward way to identify which IP addresses AT&T
assigns to their wired customers or mobile customers, or which ad-
dresses they delegate to other networks. While AT&T’s EdgeCO and
AggCO router topology can be uncovered by traceroute, this is only

possible within their respective regional networks. Our method-
ology for AT&T is similar to §5 at a high-level: we (1) build and
annotate router-level topology graphs, and then (2) construct CO
topology graphs for each regional network. The low-level method-
ology details in this section are tailored to the specific challenges
presented by AT&T.
6.1 Phase 1: Build Router-Topology Graphs
We bootstrap our discovery of router IPs in the COs by tracer-
outing from 5 Ark VPs near the region we are mapping to the IP
addresses of DSLAMs/ONTs in EdgeCOs. AT&T uses rDNS to la-
bel DSLAM/ONT IPs as *.lightspeed.(CLLI).sbcglobal.net,
illustrated in Fig. 12. We tracerouted to all 95,821 IPs matching this
pattern rDNS in the Rapid7 rDNS dataset. AT&T’s access networks
use MPLS tunnels, so these traceroutes only discovered the entry
router for the tunnel (the BackboneCO router), and the exit router
(an EdgeCO router), missing most routers in AggCOs. Further, the
bootstrap traceroutes do not observe all EdgeCO routers, because
of MPLS as well as some of DSLAMs/ONTs do not reply and per-
haps some do not have rDNS. However, we found that the EdgeCO
routers were allocated out of a few prefixes per region. For example,
there appear to be 7 /24s used for EdgeCO router IPs in AT&T’s San
Diego, CA region (indicated with “sd2ca” in the rDNS entry for
the BackboneCO router in Fig. 12). To uncover AggCO routers, we
use the same technique as in §5—traceroute to the observed MPLS
tunnel exit router [73] in the EdgeCO. Appendix C includes further
details about how we infer EdgeCOs.
Because we can only traceroute to most EdgeCO router IPs from
within the same region, we build per-region lists of EdgeCO /24s to
probe by associating /24s with the region tag in the BackboneCO
router rDNS observed in bootstrap traceroutes. We then traceroute
to all IP addresses in these prefixes in the region from a VP within
the region. We also performed alias resolution to map individual
IP addresses to routers, and then to EdgeCOs and AggCOs In to-
tal, we found 37 AT&T regional networks identified in rDNS, and
CAIDA Ark and RIPE Atlas had VPs available in 35 of these re-
gions. However, even in regions where we have many VPs, those
VPs are insufficient to reveal the complete topology. Comprehen-
sively revealing the regional network topologies requires finding
VPs with different paths. This is particularly important because, as
we will discuss in the next phase, mapping router IPs to EdgeCOs
requires at least one VP served by each EdgeCO. However, finding
topologically diverse AT&T VPs in a region we want to map is

not feasible with existing sources of crowdsourced VPs (Atlas and
Ark). Further, AT&T’s looking glasses are not suitable VPs because
they are located in AT&T’s backbone network, which EdgeCO and
AggCO routers do not respond to traceroute (ICMP) packets.
To significantly increase the number of VPs inside an AT&T
region that we are mapping, we leverage existing network infras-
tructure that reveals many geographically distributed last-mile links
in a region – public WiFi hotspots. Our insight is that many fast food
restaurant chains (e.g., McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Subway) have
many geographically distributed last-mile links, to many EdgeCOs,
serving their WiFi hotspots. We call this approach McTraceroute.
We believe this is the first network topology measurement effort
that has made use of geographically distributed WiFi hotspots.
To evaluate how well this technique improved our visibility of
a region, we ran traceroutes from all 58 McDonald’s in AT&T’s
San Diego region to all IP addresses in seven /24s that we inferred
to contain AT&T’s San Diego EdgeCOs and AggCOs. We found
23 McDonald’s that used AT&T for their free WiFi services. The
diverse location of McDonald’s restaurants, whose locations are
strategically selected to maximize coverage in an area, provided
us opportunities to connect to, and perform measurements from,
many EdgeCOs in the regional network.
Next, we investigate how many new paths we observed with each
type of VPs in San Diego, to determine if McTraceroute significantly
increases the number of paths we observe. Considering traceroute
paths starting with the second hop, the eight Atlas and two Ark
probes in AT&T’s San Diego respective regions revealed only half
of the IP paths we observed with McTraceroute. This indicates that
increasing the number of VPs revealed many more paths, despite
overlap in the McDonald’s EdgeCOs. Note that because the network
is opaque, we do not know the true number of paths, however
McTraceroute provides a significant increase in observed paths
over existing VPs.
6.2 Phase 2: Build CO-Topology Graphs
Phase 1 produced the router-level topology shown in Fig. 13a. We
inferred two backbone routers (blue), four aggregation routers (red),
and 84 EdgeCO routers (black). We inferred the EdgeCO routers
as connected redundantly to two aggregation routers each, and all
aggregation routers connected to one backbone router. The router-
level topology reveals a three-level structure, with two sub-regions
that use different aggregation routers.
To infer the CO-level topology, we first map last-mile links to
EdgeCO routers. Each last-mile link is served by a single EdgeCO,
so if two routers are one hop away from the same last-mile link, we
conclude they are both in the same CO. We observed each last-mile
link connected to two EdgeCO routers, indicating that each EdgeCO
has two routers.
We observed two backbone routers, and both appear fully con-
nected to all aggregation routers. This is unlike the cable networks,
where we observed backbone routers connected to one aggrega-
tion router. We conclude from this inference that AT&T has only
one BackboneCO in this region, and this office contains both core
routers. We are less confident about the four aggregation routers,
but the highest resilience design would have them operating out of
four different COs. Fig. 13b shows the inferred CO-level topology.

6.3 Analysis of AT&T’s Topology
AT&T’s regional network has a significantly longer history than
cable networks, dating back to the early 1900s. Therefore, we expect
its structure to reflect design choices constrained by the capabilities
of early of telephone networks. AT&T’s long distance network,
called Long Lines, only reached a single CO in each region. These
Long Lines COs now appear to serve as their BackboneCOs. In fact,
the BackboneCO we inferred in San Diego still has a Long Lines
microwave tower on its roof.
Aggregation. We observed significantly higher EdgeCO density in
AT&T’s network than in the cable providers we studied. In Charter’s
San Diego sub-region we observed 16 EdgeCOs, compared to 42 in
AT&T’s San Diego region. This CO deployment density is consistent
with AT&T facing the constraint of local copper telephone service
loop lengths. By the time cable networks emerged in the 1990s,
Hybrid Fiber Coax allowed for much longer last-mile links from
EdgeCOs to customers. We would thus expect, without considering
other factors, that AT&T aggregates fewer last-mile links to each
EdgeCO than do cable networks. This lower ratio of customers to
EdgeCO helps to reduce the scale of outages when an EdgeCO fails
(e.g., due to fiber cuts or failed equipment).
To estimate latency differences between EdgeCOs in the San
Diego region, we conducted traceroutes from a VM in a Los Angeles
Google Cloud datacenter to all of the end user AT&T IP addresses
