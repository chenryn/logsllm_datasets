## Bug Report

### Issue
Pillow has recently released version 7.0.0, which causes compatibility issues with `torchvision.transforms`. Specifically, the import fails with the following traceback:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "examples/mnist.py", line 5, in <module>
    from torchvision.transforms import (
  File "/home/felix/.local/share/virtualenvs/repro-Cd9xy9KO/lib/python3.6/site-packages/torchvision/__init__.py", line 4, in <module>

ImportError: cannot import name 'PILLOW_VERSION'
```

### Steps to Reproduce
To reproduce the issue, run the following code:

```python
from torchvision.transforms import Compose
```

### Environment
- torch: 1.3.1
- torchvision: 0.4.2
- pillow: 7.0.0

### Fix
To resolve this issue, I pinned Pillow to version 6.2.2. After doing so, the import works correctly.

```bash
pip install pillow==6.2.2
```

This ensures that the `PILLOW_VERSION` attribute, which is no longer available in Pillow 7.0.0, is still accessible.
