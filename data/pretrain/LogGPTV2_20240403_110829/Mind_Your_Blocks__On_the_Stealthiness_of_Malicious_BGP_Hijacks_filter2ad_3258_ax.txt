aggregation model M for anomaly scores.
Evaluation and ranking of candidate BGP hijacks: a multi-level
subgroups, which are then evaluated hierarchically. Figure 10
illustrates the design of our multi-stage anomaly scoring and
aggregation system, in which we organise the aggregation of
anomalies in different subgroups based on their semantics.
The advantage of a multi-stage aggregation model
is that
intermediate decision thresholds are not needed. Intermediate
aggregate scores are propagated up to the highest level where
they can contribute to the overall score.
Given the deﬁnitions here above, we deﬁne an aggregation
function Fa, with as output the aggregated score Sa given by
WOWA calculated for the anomaly a as:
Fa : Sa = W OW A(xa, wa, pa)
where xa is the vector of scores to aggregate and wa and pa
the WOWA weighting vectors. As shown in Figure 10, we can
then deﬁne our multi-stage anomaly scoring and aggregation
model M, with as output the ﬁnal score S1, for a given spam
network, as the recursive function Fa where:
F1 : S1 = W OW A(x1 = (S2, S3, S4, S5, S6), w1, p1)
F2 : S2 = W OW A(x2 = (S7, S8, S9), w2, p2)
F9 : S2 = W OW A(x9 = (ageo1, . . . , ageon−1), w9, p9)
. . .
As an example, we deﬁne w1 = (0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.0, 0.0) and
p1 = (0.2, 0.25, 0.15, 0.25, 0.15) to obtain the ﬁnal score S1 as
outcome of the top-tier aggregation stage. Vector w1 translates
here the intuition that a hijacked spam network does not always
exhibit all anomalies (e.g., a hijack does not necessarily involve
a BGP origin anomaly) hence we require that “at least some”
of the anomaly scores have a high score to contribute to a
ﬁnal aggregate score above a predeﬁned decision threshold.
The components of p1 translate the conﬁdence we have in the
different anomaly types to identify a suspicious routing change.
The highest conﬁdence score (0.25) is assigned to the tracer-
oute reachability anomaly S3 and BGP AS path deviation S5,
which by experience have proved being particularly reliable.
On the other hand the traceroute hop count anomaly S4 and
BGP origin anomaly S6 are assigned a lower conﬁdence score
(0.15) because we observed them only in a few rare hijack
scenarios. Finally, the traceroute path deviation S2 is given a
medium conﬁdence (0.2) as it can be affected by inaccuracies
in traceroute measurements. The model parameter deﬁnition
is done similarly at the other intermediary stages (for wi, pi
where i = 2, . . . , 9) so as to include expert knowledge and
model the preferences of a network analyst.
