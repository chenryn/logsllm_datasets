These results indicate that defending against IPv6 address correlation attacks requires strict limitations on both address-based and traffic characteristic correlations.

## 7.2 Attack Chance Reduction

Another effective countermeasure against IPv6 address correlation attacks is to reduce the adversary's attack opportunities. This can be achieved through the following methods:

1. **Proxy and Tor Usage**: Since adversaries require long-term monitoring to gather background knowledge, IPv6 users can evade malicious Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) by using proxies or the Tor system.
2. **Encrypted Applications**: To protect meta-information exposed in the TLS handshake, applications such as encrypted Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) can render the attack impractical.
3. **Address-User Relation Protection**: Techniques like Network Address Translation (NAT) for IPv6 are a promising approach to defend against IPv6 address correlation attacks.

## 8 Conclusion

In this work, we explore the implementation of user activity correlation on IPv6 networks. We introduce IPv6 address correlation attacks, which leverage an attack model called SIAMHAN to learn the correlation relationship between two arbitrary IPv6 addresses based on the background knowledge of TLS traffic. Through multi-level attention and metric learning on pairwise heterogeneous knowledge graphs, SIAMHAN can perform strong address correlation even in long-term correlation tasks, including user tracking and discovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIAMHAN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by significant margins. Our work highlights the serious threat posed by IPv6 address correlation attacks and calls for effective countermeasures from the IPv6 community.
