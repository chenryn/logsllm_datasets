There are several native features that necessitate listening to and modifying Windows messages. To effectively alter these messages, it is crucial to hook into the original window procedure (WndProc). 

Upon further investigation, I discovered a `PreHandleMSG` function in the Electron source code, specifically in [this file](https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc#L81). After conducting some tests, I was able to successfully modify the messages received by a window.

I am, however, unsure if this is the most optimal approach for hooking into the WndProc. Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
