There are many native features that will require listening to windows messages
and alter them.  
It's important to hook to the original wndproc so we'll be able to alter
messages as well.  
After digging in I noticed there is a PreHandleMSG in here
https://github.com/atom/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/native_window_views_win.cc#L81  
And after a bit of testings I managed to affect the messages a windows is
receiving.
I wonder if it is the best way to hook into the wndproc  
Any thoughts?
