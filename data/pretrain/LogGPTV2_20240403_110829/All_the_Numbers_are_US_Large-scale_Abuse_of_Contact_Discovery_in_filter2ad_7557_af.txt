numbers and higher conversion rates than ours occur. In such
cases, contact discovery is stopped after 20 to 100 matches,
instead of 5,000 as measured by us.
Ethical Considerations. The experiments in this work were
conducted in coordination with the ethical and legal departments
of our institution. Special care was taken to ensure the privacy
of the affected users, as detailed in § IV-D.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank Lukas Nothelfer, Florian Plesker, Oliver Schick,
and Sebastian Schindler for their invaluable help with the
implementation of our attacks.
