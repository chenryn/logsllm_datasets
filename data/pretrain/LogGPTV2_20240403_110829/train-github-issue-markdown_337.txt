Hello,

I noticed that the new `text-left`, `text-center`, and `text-right` classes are not working as expected on table cells. To ensure proper alignment, it might be helpful to add the `!important` flag to these classes. This would force the text alignment to take precedence over other conflicting styles.

Please let me know if this is a viable solution or if there are any concerns with this approach.

Best regards,
