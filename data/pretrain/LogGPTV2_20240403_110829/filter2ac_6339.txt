**ATT&CK ID:** T1542.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Component Firmware

Adversaries may modify the firmware of system components to establish persistence on a target system. In some cases, attackers use advanced methods to compromise hardware components and install malicious firmware. This allows them to execute their code outside the operating system and the main system firmware or BIOS. While this technique is similar to System Firmware attacks, it specifically targets other system components or devices that may lack the same level of integrity checking and security capabilities.
