### 5.4 Impact on Flow Classifier

For flow-based scan detection, we utilize two sets of rules. The first set is based on scan detection algorithms that provide strong evidence. The second set defines rules that indicate potential scanning but with weaker evidence. Specifically, this set includes flows directed towards unpopulated IP addresses or those consisting of a single packet that do not match any other rule. Validation shows that the second rule set is highly effective for scan detection. As a result, we have added this rule set to the "Malicious Scanning" class, thereby eliminating the initially defined "Suspicious Other" class. Notably, 65.1% of the flows matching these rules are confirmed as scanners when observing host behavior over an extended period.

During validation, we also revised the assignment of ICMP flows. We observed that 92.1% of all ICMP flows originate from identified scanners. Without detailed ICMP type/code information, it is challenging to distinguish backscatter ICMP flows from scanning. Consequently, we moved a rule initially assigned to the "Backscatter" class (assuming ICMP replies from DoS attacks) to the "Malicious Scanning" class. Additionally, we introduced the "InOut" sign to identify host pair communication situations where an ICMP flow is a reply to a one-way flow exchanged between the same host pair. This sign is used in the "Suspected Benign" class.

### 6. ONE-WAY TRAFFIC COMPOSITION

In this section, we apply our classification scheme to a large dataset of flow records collected between 2004 and 2011 to analyze the composition and characteristics of one-way traffic.

**Aggregate Statistics:**
- One-way traffic constitutes a significant portion of Internet traffic. During the studied period, one-way flows accounted for between 34% and 67% of the total number of flows towards the monitored network. This is particularly important for systems that need to maintain per-flow state, such as stateful firewalls and flow meters.
- Due to their short-lived nature, one-way traffic corresponds to only 3.4% and 0.79% of the total number of packets and bytes, respectively. This indicates that one-way traffic is not a significant problem in terms of bandwidth consumption and packet overhead.

**Traffic Breakdown:**
- Figure 4 illustrates the breakdown of one-way traffic into different classes in terms of flow counts. Table 7 provides the fraction of one-way traffic for each measurement period and class, both in terms of flows and packets.
- On average, the "Malicious Scanning" class accounts for 83.5% of all one-way flows, followed by "Benign P2P" (6.7%), "Service Unreachable" (4.8%), "Suspected Benign" (2.6%), "Other" (2.2%), "Backscatter" (0.3%), and "Bogon" (0.1%).
- In terms of packets, "Malicious Scanning" accounts for 62.6%, "Benign P2.P" for 13.0%, "Service Unreachable" for 10.1%, "Suspected Benign" for 9.1%, "Other" for 4.7%, "Backscatter" for 0.5%, and "Bogon" for 0.03%.

**Observations:**
- One-way traffic is dominated by scanning activities. However, in terms of packets, scanning accounts for a smaller fraction (62.6%) of the total number of one-way packets. This is because one-way flows classified as scanning consist of an average of 1.6 packets per flow.
- In contrast, one-way flows in the "Service Unreachable" and "Benign P2P" classes consist of 4.1 and 12.1 packets per flow, respectively. This difference is due to the persistence of TCP one-way flows in SYN packet retransmission attempts and the multi-packet nature of UDP flows in the "Benign P2P" class.

**Changes Over Time:**
- Figure 5 compares the mean daily number of one- and two-way flows between 2004 and 2011. The volume of one-way flows has exhibited small fluctuations, while the number of two-way flows has grown significantly by 343%.
- The fraction of one-way flows has dropped over time, from 67% in 2004 to approximately one-third of incoming flows since 2007.
- The "Malicious Scanning" class started at 87.2% in 2004 and declined to 68.3% in August 2008, correlating with an increase in "Benign P2P" and "Unreachable" traffic.

### 7. SERVICE REACHABILITY MONITORING

In this section, we leverage one-way flows classified as "Service Unreachable" to demonstrate a new approach for monitoring local services and detecting reachability problems.

**Methodology:**
- Using one-way flows classified as "Service Unreachable" and bidirectional flows as input, we compute three metrics to evaluate the reachability of local services within the network of ETH Zurich.
- **Availability:** Defined as the number of time intervals a service is alive (i.e., has bidirectional flows) over the number of intervals it is either alive or unresponsive (i.e., has only incoming one-way flows). This metric helps categorize services into permanently and temporarily offered ones.
- **Reachability:** Defined as the number of distinct client IP addresses with bidirectional flows to the service over the total number of distinct client IP addresses during a time interval. This metric is useful for identifying misconfigurations and outages.
- **Outage Impact:** Defined as the number of unique client IP addresses involved in one-way flows of the "Service Unreachable" class during a time interval. This metric provides a lower bound on the actual number of affected clients and is useful for assessing the impact of failures.

**Outages and Misconfigurations:**
- We applied our scheme to a randomly selected week of NetFlow data from our archive, focusing on services within the address range of the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Zurich.
- We discovered 43 remotely accessible departmental services with well-known port numbers that had more than 20 unique clients during any time interval. We computed our three metrics for these services.
- We validated our observations with network administrators, who confirmed the validity of the discovered services and provided feedback on several interesting outages.
- We identified 32 services available at least 99% of the time and 11 services that either fail frequently or are not always operational. For all frequently used services, we found a global outage on June 23, 2011, starting at approximately 19:40 UTC.
