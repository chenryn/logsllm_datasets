User: We are using Nginx as a reverse proxy server and would like to achieve load balancing and high availability. Please give a reasonable solution.
Assistant: reasonable solution is to use the upstream module of Nginx to configure the load balancing and health check of the back-end server, and use HAProxy or Keepalived to achieve high availability of Nginx. The specific steps are as follows: 1. In the Nginx configuration file, use the upstream module to define the list of backend servers and the load balancing method. For example: ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example.com; server backend2.example.com; server backend3.example.com; ... balancer_method round-robin; } ``` 2. In the Nginx configuration file, use The proxy_pass directive forwards the request to the backend server. For example: ``` location / { proxy_pass http://backend; } ``` 3. Use the upstream_conf module or detection script to perform health checks, and dynamically adjust the backend server list according to the check results to ensure that faulty nodes do not participate in the load balanced. 4. Use HAProxy or Keepalived to achieve high availability of Nginx. HAProxy or Keepalived can form multiple Nginx instances into a cluster, and achieve high availability through mechanisms such as active-standby switchover and health check. For example, using the backend directive in the HAProxy configuration file can be implemented as follows: ``` backend nginx_cluster mode tcp balance roundrobin server web1 192.168.1.101:80 check server web2 192.168.1.102:80 check backup server web3 192.168.1.103:80 ch eck`` ` Among them, mode tcp means to use the TCP protocol for communication; balance roundrobin means to use the round robin algorithm for load balancing; the server command defines each Nginx instance and the corresponding IP address and port; the check command enables the health check. The backup command indicates that the node is a backup node, and it will only work when the primary node fails.
