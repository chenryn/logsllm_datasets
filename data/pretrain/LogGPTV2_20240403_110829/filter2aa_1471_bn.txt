### WNF State Names and Storage

WNF (Windows Notification Facility) state names are represented as 64-bit identifiers, such as `0xAC41491908517835`, and are defined using C preprocessor macros like `WNF_AUDC_CAPTURE_ACTIVE`. These identifiers encode several pieces of information:

- **Version Number**: A version number (1).
- **Lifetime**: Persistent or temporary.
- **Scope**: Process-instanced, container-instanced, user-instanced, session-instanced, or machine-instanced.
- **Permanent Data Flag**: Indicates if the data is permanent.
- **Prefix and Unique Sequence Number**: For well-known state names, a prefix identifying the owner followed by a unique sequence number.

#### Format of a WNF State Name
The format of a WNF state name is illustrated in Figure 8-41 below.

**Figure 8-41: Format of a WNF state name.**

### Well-Known State Names
Well-known state names are preprovisioned for out-of-order use. They are stored in the registry under the key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Notifications`. Each state name has a value that encodes the security descriptor, maximum data size, and type ID (if any).

### Persistent State Names
Persistent state names remain registered for the duration of the system's uptime, regardless of the registrarâ€™s process lifetime. They require the `SeCreatePermanentPrivilege` privilege and are stored in the registry under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\VolatileNotifications`. These keys use the registry's volatile flag to disappear after a reboot.

### Permanent State Names
Permanent state names persist even across reboots. They are stored in the registry under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Notifications` without the volatile flag set. The `SeCreatePermanentPrivilege` privilege is also required for this level of persistence. For these types of WNF states, there is an additional registry key called `Data`, which contains the last change stamp and binary data for each 64-bit encoded WNF state name identifier.

### Temporary State Names
Temporary state names are not known in advance and require consumers and producers to pass the identifier between each other. No registry keys are used to encode these names, and they are based on a monotonically increasing sequence number.

### Experiment: View WNF State Names and Data in the Registry
To view WNF state names and data in the registry, follow these steps:

1. **Open Registry Editor** and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Notifications`.
2. **View the Values**: You should see values like `41950C3EA3BC0875 (WNF_SBS_UPDATE_AVAILABLE)`.
3. **Double-Click a Value**: Open the raw registry data binary editor for a value like `41950C3EA3BC0875 (WNF_SBS_UPDATE_AVAILABLE)`.
4. **Observe the Data**: Note the security descriptor and maximum data size.
5. **Navigate to Permanent WNF State**: Go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Data` and view values like `418B1D29A3BC0C75 (WNF_DSM_DSMAPPINSTALLED)`.

**Caution**: Do not modify any registry values, as this can make your system inoperable or vulnerable to attacks.
