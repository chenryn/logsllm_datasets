User: I installed OpenERP 6.1 on windows using the AllInOne package. I did NOT install Python separately. Apparently OpenERP folders already contain the required python executables.
Now when I try to install certain addons, I usually come across requirements to install certain python modules. E.g. to install Jasper_Server, I need to install http2, pypdf and python-dime. 
As there is no separate Python installation, there is no C:\Python or anything like that. Where and how do I install these python packages so that I am able to install the addon?
Thanks
Assistant: Good question..
Openerp on windows uses a dll for python (python26.dll in /Server/server of the openerp folder in program files). It looks like all the extra libraries are in the same folder, so you should be able to download the extra libraries to that folder and restart the service. (I usually stop the service and run it manually from the command line - its easier to see if there are any errors etc while debugging) 
Let us know if you get it working!
