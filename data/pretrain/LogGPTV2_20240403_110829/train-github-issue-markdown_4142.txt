### Problem
Latex compilers are very slow.
### Proposed solution
Typst is orders of magnitude faster than any latex compiler (runs in
milliseconds) and has a much easier to use syntax than latex (subjective but I
think most agree). I'd like to request support for it as a rendering engine
for math in figures.
I'm not sure how rendering is currently done, but here's an example of a
0-margin document with math using typst:
    #set page(width: auto, height: auto, margin: 0pt)
    $ y = integral_(x_0)^x f(s) d s $
