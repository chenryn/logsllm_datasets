Basically most times I want to make a dialog that instead of having a defined
size takes all the available size (up to maxSize=xs/md...) instead of adapting
to the content size. To do this I had to make my own style around it:
    import { default as Dialog, DialogProps } from 'material-ui/Dialog';
    import withStyles from 'material-ui/styles/withStyles';
    import * as React from 'react';
    export const FullWidthDialog = withStyles(
      {
        paper: {
          width: '100%'
        }
      }
    )(
      (props: DialogProps) => {
        const { children, ...others } = props;
        return (
            {children}
        );
      }
    );
Would it be sensible to add a "fullWidth" to the dialog property that does
that for you?
