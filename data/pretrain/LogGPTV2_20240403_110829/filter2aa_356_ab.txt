are sector blocks logically grouped together that contain a specific MODULE.  Each 
UBA block might be different per a drive manufacturer. The UBA # might be Smart 
Data on one drive and a different type of data on another drive. The UBA area is 
inaccessible over the standard interface. Most of the commands to talk to the UBA 
modules are vendor specific and which is generally not made publically available. 
There are certain pieces of hardware that can be used to communicate with this area 
such as the PC3000.

For example: In the UBA 1 Area it could be a Bad Block List.  As larger drives have 
been created there has been a need for larger bad block areas.  So this might be 
expanded from two sectors in a previous drive to three sectors in a newer drive. But 
the firmware for the drive can still refer to each of them as UBA 1 and does not have to 
have any changes made to the code in the firmware regardless of the size change. 
Slide 2221: When the drive is manufactured it is known that there is going to be errors 
in every drive.  Drives use ECC to correct most errors and if ECC can correct the error 
then the sector is never marked as bad.  If it is marked as bad, the drive puts the data 
in a bad block list. Most people know that their hard drive has a bad block table. What 
most people do not know is that their drive has TWO bad block tables. 
1. P-List (Primary Defects List – manufacture defect info that does not change) 
2. G-List (Grown Defects Lists – sector relocation table) 
The G-List is where the bad blocks that your drive has on a daily basis are stored. 
Since the P-List is done at manufacturing time that list is never suppose to change. 
There is a very important reason to know about both lists in a low level recovery which 
I will explain when we get to the repair section. There are certain utilities that can read, 
delete, merge and change this data. 
ECC Notes and Issues 
ECC structured redundancy up to 200 bits of 256/512 in a 
sector-CRC–Scrambled Bits- RLL adds bits to cause pulses and 
Parity 
When data is written to the drive it is encoded. The actual data 
itself is never written, only the interpretation of the data. If you 
are thinking that a drive contains 0’s and 1’s then you are 
thinking about it incorrectly. The data is more like a wave form 
being written to the drive. It has to be interpreted back on its way 
out before it becomes a 0 or a 1. Before the data is written the 
data is randomized. This eliminates patterns that might be the 
same so that ECC is not confused. It is difficult to do pattern 
detection on a pattern that appears over and over. EMI can be 
reduced and have less effect on the bit storage and the timing 
controls. 
The drive tries several different ways to re-read the data before 
giving up, most of them using ECC. It is possible for ECC to 
improperly correct data under certain circumstances if the data 
occurs in a certain order. ECC read commands use ODD 
numbering of at least 3 so as not to cause a 50/50 chance in the 
selection of 2.

Data Recovery Whitepaper – Rev 17                                                                                                   Page 7 of 22 
Read ignoring ECC is an LBA 28 command “Read Long” and it 
was disabled in 48 bits as it was determined to be obsolete in 
drives over 137 gigs. No Read Ignore ECC is available after 137 
gigs. Standard attempts are tried and usually are 10 tries in most 
hard drives. Reading a drive ignoring ECC can cause possible 
corruption in the data, but sometimes it is the only way to get the 
data in those sectors if there is a problem with the PCB or the 
ECC cannot read the data correctly. 
If the Sector is determined to be unreadable by the ECC 
encoder then the sector is retried again. Reed Solomon in 
conjunction with sector rereads is expecting to fix data errors for 
the ECC. Parity bits are stripped off.  
Slide 2422: The cylinder structure is extremely important because there are people 
believe they can just take the platters out and move them to a new drive. This is true 
you can do this, but you have to move all platters simultaneously. The reason is 
because data is written in a cylinder.  Most people have heard the term cylinder in 
reference to their hard drive, but they have no idea what that means. Writing in a 
cylinder means that data is written in parallel due to the fact the heads are always 
moving together in the same stack.  To make it more efficient data is written on the top 
of a platter and the bottom of the platter and the next platters and so on, at the same 
time.  Your data is NOT written on the top of one platter and when that gets full then 
written to the next platter. It is written across all the platters at the same time, making a 
cylinder of your data. 
Most data recovery software will scan an entire hard drive and then display a list of 
files and directory trees you can recover from. However, if there is a lot of damage to 
the drive, the scanning may never finish or it might die/kill it in the process. If you have 
smart software and you can figure out where your partitions start and where the MFT 
or FAT tables might be, you stand a better chance of getting the data you are looking 
for.  If a standard utility was used to create the partition then the partition structure will 
begin on a cylinder boundary. Again, your partition will begin on a Cylinder Boundary. 
Software like Byteback (www.byteback.org) RecoverSoft Media Tools Pro 
(www.recoversoft.com), and Runtimes Disk Explorer (www.runtime.org) are smart 
enough to know the data exists on the cylinder boundary and will quickly check without 
you have to scan the whole hard drive and possibly saving your drive from disaster 
during the scan. There certainly are times that scanning will be required but it is best if 
you can avoid it except in an imaging process. 
Slide 2585: The MR (magnetoresistive) head of the hard drive you can think of as the 
head of the 90’s. If you remember how reliable the drives were before 2000 it is mostly

Data Recovery Whitepaper – Rev 17                                                                                                   Page 8 of 22 
because of this head and the density of the platters.  This head was used on drives 
mostly before we crossed the 10-20 gig barriers. The MR head could determine if a bit 
passed under it.  When data passed parallel to the head, the head could detect the 
“MR Effect” due to movement of electrons causing the magnetic field to rotate positive 
and negative values. 
Slide 2840: The GMR (giant magnetoresistive) head is the current head used on most 
hard drives. This head uses high end physics I do not claim to understand. The only 
major difference is the way the head has been changed to read perpendicular. The 
GMR head has four layers, a sensing layer, a conducting layer, a pinned layer and an 
exchange layer.  It was discovered that if you took two magnetic layers and aligned 
them opposite each other with a soft layer between them that the magnetic force would 
align themselves in parallel. When a bit of data passes under the heads the electrons 
bounce around in the layers causing the pinned layer to spin.  
For more info, read http://www.hitachigst.com/hdd/technolo/gmr/gmr.htm 
Slide 2865: Hard drives have switched to Perpendicular Recording.  I talked about the 
changes and previous versions last year and you can reference that speech for more 
info. The biggest change switching to perpendicular is that the data is written up and 
down instead of longitudinal. Because of this, changes had to be made to the platter so 
it would not interfere with reading and writing.    
Slide 2885: The coatings have changed and  the substrate on the bottom (the platter 
itself) was the biggest change. Almost every platter has converted to a glass ceramic 
platter.  What this means to you in data recovery is that it is obvious when a scratch 
occurs. In most cases you will be able to see though the platter. Sometimes the rings 
that are created by the scratch are so smooth that they look like they are supposed to 
be there.  I assure you that they are not.  It should be silver from one edge to the other 
with no rings at all.  So if you see a ring, in most cases the game is over or your 
recovery just got a lot harder. 
Slide 3000:  The data structure that is written to the sectors is important to understand if 
you are using any diagnostic software.  Many of them use common nomenclature to 
discuss the types of errors.

Notes for Diagram for Info on a Sector: Draft Drawing for Slide 
Heads use servo info to identify the correct track. Then the heads read each and every 
sector ID block to determine if it is the correct one using the “translator.” If the ID field is 
corrupt there is nothing to identify what the data is looking for and it will flag the IDNF (ID 
Not Found) error. 
If it finds the correct sector ID, the heads then would read the Address Marker for the 512 
bytes of data that go with that location. If this info is corrupt then the heads cannot locate 
the beginning of the data and will return the AMNF (Address Marker Not Found) error. 
An AMNF error means that the ID Marker info WAS found but that the data in the markers

that goes with that address were NOT found, again losing 512 bytes of user data. 
After the data is written, a 4 byte block of ECC data is written. After the 512 bytes are read 
the drive will calculate the ECC Info and reads the ECC blocks of data and compares them. If 
they are not equal then the drive re-reads the data until timeout occurs causing the ECC 
data error. If it is not able to re-read and correct the error it will cause the UNC flag to state 
that the data in error is uncorrectable. It is possible to do a data recovery ignoring ECC but 
you will have no way to verify that the data read was correct.  This should be done as the 
last phase to capture the data that could not be read any other way. 
You will see the error codes here in almost all data recovery and diagnostic software.  
This particular block of data (slide 3259) is one single sector. It contains a 512 byte 
block of data.  This is how on sector looks to every hard drive regardless of your 
operating system.  
I could not possibly explain every error you will see, but I can give you the basics of the 
most common you will see doing diagnostics.  
• IDNF is the Address not found. If the sector that holds this information is 
corrupt there is no way for the hard drive to locate this sector and it will return 
the result IDNF. 
• AMNF is the Address Marker Not Found. This is similar to the IDNF but 
relates to the data. If there is an error and this marker is corrupt then the data 
for this sector cannot be located. The data in this area is 512 bytes of user 
data. 
• ECC is that there is a problem reading from ECC and it does not match. ECC 
is used to check the integrity of the data being read. When the data is read 
the drive calculates the ECC and compares. If there is an error the drive will 
retry until it cannot get a correct result and then will return the UNC error. 
• UNC will happen when the data is uncorrectable data error. 
• ABRT is an abort error and it will discontinue trying to read that block. 
Slide 3559: The preamp is a chip that amplifies the signal coming from the heads of the 
drive. Since the data that is read coming from the heads is similar to a wave form from a

speaker, the preamp will amplify it and send it on to the electronics for decoding. There 
are two types of preamps, one is soldered on, and the second is glued on.  It is often 
possible for a preamp to come loose due to heat expansion and not to have a good 
connection to the board. It is also possible for the preamp to fail. This is one of the 
causes of the click of death for the hard drive. It is often difficult to replace or fix this
