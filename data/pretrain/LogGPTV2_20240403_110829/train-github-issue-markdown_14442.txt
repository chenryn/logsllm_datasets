I have a system with limited network bandwidth. if I make an upload or
download large file operation using the requests library, the single request
is consuming the whole available bandwidth of the system. is there a way to
add latency to these requests (which slows down throughout of serial requests
but not consume overall bandwidth)?
A direct solution to set download/upload bandwidth for an individual HTTP
request or to keep a part of the total available bandwidth free would be
great.
