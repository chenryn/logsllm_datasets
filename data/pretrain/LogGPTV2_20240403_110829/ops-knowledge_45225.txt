I have a fairly standard setup, consisting of three servers: `www`, `app`, and `db`. These servers are managed using Fabric scripts, and the entire configuration is stored in a GitHub repository. I also have a local clone of this repository on my laptop. When I make changes locally, I push them to GitHub, and then Jenkins pulls from GitHub to deploy the changes.

The issue I'm facing is that I often end up with numerous commits, many of which contain typos or other minor issues. This results in a commit history that looks messy and unprofessional. While the round trip to GitHub isn't a major concern, the sheer number of unnecessary commits is. Unfortunately, once these commits are pushed, I can't easily squash them, making the commit history look ugly.

Directly editing files on the servers isn't feasible, as the files are spread across multiple directories on three different servers. Attempting to make each directory a clone of the GitHub repository and keeping everything in sync would be extremely difficult. Additionally, writing scripts to synchronize the servers with my local repository would be overly complex, especially given the complexity of the existing Fabric scripts.

Another approach I considered was using `git pull` directly from Jenkins, but this still requires me to commit changes, leading to the same problem of a cluttered commit history.

I'm struggling to find a graceful solution to this problem. Any ideas?

**Potential Solution:**

One possible solution is to avoid using GitHub and Jenkins for deployment altogether. Instead, treat the servers as part of the "local" deployment process (where "local" refers to pre-commit). This means using the Fabric scripts directly from my laptop to deploy changes to the servers.

While this approach might be more challenging due to the preprocessing that currently happens on Jenkins, it is replicable. By embracing this method, I can avoid the messiness of the commit history and maintain a cleaner, more professional workflow.

As Jeff Atwood once said, "embrace the suck, in public." I may not have handled this perfectly, but I've learned from the experience. I'll put my brain in the right place and tackle this challenge head-on tomorrow.
