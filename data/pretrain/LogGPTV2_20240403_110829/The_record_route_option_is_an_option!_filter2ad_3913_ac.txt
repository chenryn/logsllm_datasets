surements while working at large cloud providers, we assume it
is feasible to tunnel the packet to the edge of the cloud provider’s
AS without using any RR hops, and so we count the length of the
traceroute starting at the first hop outside of the cloud provider’s AS.
2GCE strips options headers from ping-RRs issued from VMs within the network,
while Amazon EC2 and IBM Softlayer (now Bluemix) both outright filter ping-RRs.
Figure 3: Hop count from GCE and M-Lab to RR-reachable and RR-
responsive destinations. GCE is closer to RR-responsive destinations
than M-Lab is to RR-reachable ones, meaning it is likely in range to
measure reverse hops.
Figure 3 focuses on one cloud provider, Google Compute Engine
(GCE). It shows the path length distributions of two sets of
destinations—41,000 RR-reachable destinations, for which we have
both M-Lab and GCE traceroutes, and 263,000 RR-responsive
(but not RR-reachable) destinations, for which we have only GCE
traceroute path lengths. In total, the set of RR-reachable destinations
appear to be significantly closer in terms of traceroute hops to GCE
than they are to the set of M-Lab vantage points. Given that these
destinations are known to be within nine RR hops of M-Lab, we
would expect a great many (if not all) of them to be within nine
RR hops of GCE as well. Additionally, 49% of RR-responsive
destinations are within 5 traceroute hops of GCE—a shorter distance
than that between nearly 80% of M-Lab vantage points and their
known RR-reachable destinations, meaning that a large fraction of
these may be close enough for GCE to measure reverse paths. While
GCE had the shortest path distribution, we also found Amazon
EC2 to be within 8 RR hops of 40% of the same RR-responsive
destinations and IBM Softlayer within 8 hops of 45%. These results
suggest that, should cloud providers adopt RR, they would likely
make good vantage points. Specifically in the case of Google,
RR could help solve some of its need to uncover the paths from
end-users to Google [13].
4 Mitigating Rate Limiting
Router configurations sometimes limit the allowable rate of Options
packets to ten per second [4], which can severely hamper probing
efforts, particularly when probing large sets of destinations from
multiple vantage points. We briefly quantify the impact of rate limit-
ing (§4.1), then consider an approach to avoid destination-proximate
rate limiting by sending probes with limited TTL values (§4.2).
4.1 Finding Evidence of Rate Limiting
In Section 3, we probed at 20 packets per second (pps) in a loose
attempt to limit the impact of rate limiting. To see whether we
could have probed faster without impacting our results, we first
randomly selected a set of 100,000 destinations previously deemed
RR-responsive. Next, we probed these destinations from all vantage
points at 100pps and 10pps. As with our original study, each VP

probed the destination set in random order. Figure 4 depicts the
number of responses each VP received at each rate, excluding 56
VPs that received fewer than 1000 responses at either rate. While
most vantage points receive only slightly fewer responses at 100pps,
a few experience a drastic drop. For eight nodes (five Planetlab
and three M-Lab), the response dropped by more than 25%. Our
results suggest that rate limits (up to 100pps) have a limited impact
on response rates for most VPs in our study, meaning it is not a
significant factor in limiting the utility of RR measurements. Further,
VPs with lower rate limits are easy to detect and can be configured to
use lower VP-specific probing rates to achieve high response rates.
4.2 Choosing Low-Impact TTLs
A ping-RR accrues no additional value once the nine slots are full.
However, the packet’s IP Option will still have to be processed by the
route processor of every remaining router on the forward and reverse
path, leaving it susceptible to rate limiting or filtering, and incurring
wasted processing on routers’ slow paths [10].In the rate-limiting
study in Section 4.1, we randomized the order of destinations at
each VP to avoid triggering rate limiters closer to the destinations.
However, there may be times when it is necessary to probe sets of
destinations that are similarly located. In these cases, we propose to
limit the TTL of the initial ping-RR, such that it is highly likely
to expire around the time the RR slots are exhausted. The expiring
packet will trigger a TTL Time Exceeded error message which will
not have the RR Option enabled, but the original RR Option will be
in the header of the packet quoted inside the error message, allowing
us to read it at the source. While at first glance the right answer
might seem to be a TTL of nine, there are routers that support RR
but do not decrement the TTL or do not send TTL expired errors
(i.e., anonymous routers[21]), and there are routers that decrement
TTLs but do not stamp RR [20]. Too low a TTL leaves RR slots
unused; too high risks rate limiting or filtering.
To study the trade-off, we issued a round of ping-RRs to an equal
number of RR-reachable and non-RR-reachable, RR-responsive
destinations per vantage point (i.e., each vantage point probed a set
near it and a set far from it), with randomly assigned TTLs between
3 to 23 or the standard default TTL (64). In Figure 5, we show
response rate separately for RR-reachable and non-RR-reachable
Figure 5: Responsive rate for RR-reachable and RR-unreachable
destinations with different TTL values. TTLs in the range of 10 to 12
offer a good tradeoff in allowing probes to distant destinations to
expire while still reaching most RR-reachable destinations.
destinations, grouped by initial TTL. For the former, we want to
set a TTL such that most ping-RRs reach the destinations. For the
latter, we want to minimize the number of hops that the ping-RRs
traverse after filling their nine slots.
For TTL smaller than 8, less than half of RR-reachable destinations
respond, which means most of the time we would fail to retrieve
complete path information due to a premature timeout. When TTL
equals to 10, roughly 70% of the previously reachable destinations
are responsive, while only 25% of the previously unreachable desti-
nations respond. Above 12, we receive responses from the majority
of non-RR-reachable destinations, which means we lose the benefit
of expiring ineffective measurements. Though the exact tradeoff
between efficiency and coverage depends on the application, the
graph shows that setting TTLs between 10 and 12 could substan-
tially reduce the impact of RR probes on routers while still reaching
most RR-reachable destinations. This result implies that one can
effectively TTL-limit ping-RR probes to mitigate their adverse
impact on routers.
5 Conclusion
This paper addresses the question: “Is the IP Record Route Option
useful for conducting Internet path measurements?” We found that,
contrary to conventional wisdom, the answer is yes. Our measure-
ments show that:
∙ The majority of ping-responsive IP addresses and ASes respond
to RR probes, and their responses can be recorded from most of
our PlanetLab and Measurement Lab vantage points.
∙ A large fraction of IP addresses that respond to RR are reachable
within 9 hops of at least one of our vantage points, and a majority
of those are within the 8 hops needed to measure reverse paths.
∙ Large cloud providers, like Google, Amazon, and IBM are suf-
ficiently close to most destinations to record their forward and
reverse paths, which they can use to diagnose and improve per-
formance for clients.
∙ There is no evidence that, of ASes that do not filter RR packets,
any systematically refuse to stamp them.

IMC ’17, November 1–3, 2017, London, United Kingdom
This level of Record Route support may not reflect conscious choices
of network operators worldwide, but may be due to the fact that RR,
and IP options more generally, have seen little use. Should there be
a wide-scale increase in RR traffic, it is possible that some opera-
tors might configure routers within their networks to filter or refuse
to stamp packets with RR enabled, leading to decreases in respon-
siveness and reachability. For this reason, we suggest exercising
prudence when adopting RR for use in measurement systems and
studies. However, there is reason for optimism. Our Reverse Tracer-
oute system, which was well-received at the time of publication in
2010 [11], has been using RR for daily operation and related studies
consistently over the past nine years. Our measurements suggest that
support has not dwindled in the face of our traffic. Moving forward,
we hope that the need for effective topological measurement tools
outweighs competing concerns, so that researchers may continue to
discover new and better uses of the Record Route Option.
