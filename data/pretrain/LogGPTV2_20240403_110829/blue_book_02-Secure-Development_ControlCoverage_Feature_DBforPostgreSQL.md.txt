## Important Notice: DevOps Kit (AzSK) Sunset
The DevOps Kit (AzSK) will be sunset by the end of FY21. For more details, please refer to the [AzSK Sunset Notice](../../../ReleaseNotes/AzSKSunsetNotice.md).

### Azure Database for PostgreSQL Security Controls

#### 1. **Least Privilege Access**
- **Description & Rationale**: Access to Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers must be granted in accordance with the principle of least privilege. Granting minimum access ensures that users have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks, thereby minimizing the risk of resource exposure in case of a user or service account compromise.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated**: No

#### 2. **SSL Connection Enforcement**
- **Description & Rationale**: SSL connections must be enabled for Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Enforcing SSL connections between the database server and client applications helps protect against "man-in-the-middle" attacks by encrypting the data stream.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 3. **IP Address Configuration**
- **Description & Rationale**: Configure only the required IP addresses on the PostgreSQL server. Avoid using the 'Any-to-Any' IP range (0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255). Using the firewall feature restricts access to the data or service to a specific set or group of clients. Note that while this control provides an extra layer of protection, it may not be feasible in all scenarios.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 4. **Allow Access to Azure Services**
- **Description & Rationale**: Use the 'Allow access to Azure services' flag only if required. This setting configures a broad range of IP addresses from Azure as permitted to access the PostgreSQL server. Ensure that your scenario truly requires this setting before enabling it, as turning it on exposes the server to potential attacks from other resources within the Azure region.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 5. **Backup and Disaster Recovery Planning**
- **Description & Rationale**: Backup and disaster recovery must be planned for the default Azure Database for PostgreSQL service. The service offers backup and disaster recovery up to 35 days, with options for locally redundant or geo-redundant backup storage. Critical workloads require adequate backups to ensure data integrity.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 6. **Advanced Threat Protection**
- **Description & Rationale**: Enable Advanced Threat Protection for Azure Database for PostgreSQL. This feature provides a layer of security that enables detection and response to potential threats by generating security alerts for anomalous activities.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 7. **Virtual Network Rules for Improved Isolation**
- **Description & Rationale**: Consider using virtual network rules to improve isolation for your Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Virtual network rules permit only specified virtual networks to access the database server, enhancing security.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 8. **Diagnostics Logs Retention**
- **Description & Rationale**: Enable diagnostics logs with a retention period of at least 365 days. Long-term log retention is essential for recreating activity trails during investigations following an incident or compromise. A one-year retention period is typical for many compliance requirements.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 9. **Periodic Log Reviews**
- **Description & Rationale**: Review diagnostic, activity, and audit logs for Azure Database for PostgreSQL periodically. Regular reviews help identify anomalous activity early, allowing for timely responses and mitigating the risk of major compromises.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Automated**: No

#### 10. **Enable PostgreSQL Server Logging Parameters**
- **Description & Rationale**: Enable the `log_connections` and `log_disconnections` parameters on the PostgreSQL server. These logging parameters enable the collection of important system events related to security. Regular monitoring of logs can help detect suspicious and malicious activity early.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Automated**: Yes

#### 11. **Connection Throttling**
- **Description & Rationale**: Ensure the `connection_throttling` server parameter is set to 'ON'. Connection throttling protects the server against password guessing and brute force attacks.
- **Severity**: High
- **Automated**: Yes

By implementing these controls, you can enhance the security and compliance of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL environment.
