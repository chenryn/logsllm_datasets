# Bug report
## Describe the bug
My import dependency tree looks like this:
    - main app
      - components library
        - antd
The components library is built with `next/babel`. When running a production
build, I get the following error:

I used this as a reference to build my next config:
https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-ant-design-less
Everything works fine until I include the components repo (I can use antd in
the main app without a problem). Any idea how to work around this issue?
I imagine directly including the components library in the next config would
work, but I'm not sure how exactly to do this with the next/babel preset.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. Clone https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-ant-design-less
  2. Include any library that has a dependency on antd
  3. Run next build
## Expected behavior
The build works.
