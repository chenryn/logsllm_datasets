comparator will be low. Once the IR photodiode detects an
IR light, the output voltage becomes high (5V). We record
the output of the ampliﬁer using a National Instruments
USB-6009 data acquisition unit (DAQ) at a rate of 1 kHz,
which is suﬃcient to capture IR ﬂashes. In practice, the IR
sensor can be combined with a microprocessor and an RF
module to sense and report IR ﬂashes wirelessly.
5.3 Experiments and Results
Here, we examine whether RF sniﬃng can reveal informa-
tion about (1) Daily routines, like a resident’s sleeping cycle
or work shift information. (2) Appliance activities, like the
usage patterns of appliances in a household (e.g., when an
appliance is on or oﬀ).
To evaluate whether RF sniﬃng can reveal daily rou-
tines and appliance activities, we measured two metrics: (1)
Step changes, which are ‘jumps’ between two consecutive
power consumption levels [26]. Let Φ(t) be the total power
consumption rate (Watt) at time t. A step change hap-
pens when |Φ(t + Δt) − Φ(t)| > α, where α is a threshold
value determined by measurement noise. The number of
step changes is an eﬀective metric for detecting customers’
daily routines [6]. (2) Activities, which are appliances be-
ing turned on or oﬀ. To identify the number of step changes
and to recognize appliance status changes, we developed our
algorithms based upon Hart’s algorithm [26], which utilizes
edge detection to identify step changes and recognizes ap-
pliance activities by matching step changes with appliance
power consumption signatures.
Feasibility of Inferring Sensitive Information. RF
eavesdropping suﬀers from low granularity of obtained data,
since a meter-E broadcasts its reading every 30 seconds with
a data precision of 160 Wh, and unpredictable channel envi-
ronments and frequency hopping make eavesdropping unreli-
able. A key question to answer is whether RF eavesdropping
can obtain data that suﬃce to infer sensitive information, a
concern that arose in smart meters.
To answer the question, we conducted two experiments.
In the ﬁrst experiment, we monitored a meter of an apart-
ment with one resident for 24 hours in late spring when heat-
ing was not used. The meter was installed in a private room
with lighting, and thus the camera captured dot changes
throughout the entire experiment. As expected, both cam-
era and IR-based methods captured data with higher gran-
ularity than RF sniﬃng. To evaluate RF sniﬃng with vari-
ous levels of receiving capability, we emulated the captured
consumption data at multiple packet receiving rates (i.e.,
pph). We observed that when an attacker can eavesdrop
a reasonable percentage of packets (e.g., 25 pph), enough
step changes can be captured to identify high-load appli-
ance activities (e.g., water heater turned on). Even when
the received packet rate is as low as 2 pph, daily routines
still can be inferred (Fig. 12).
The second experiment occurred in July when air condi-
tioners were used to cope with the summer heat. We mon-
itored the energy consumption using an RF sniﬀer in one
author’s neighborhood. Figure 13 shows the electricity con-
sumptions of one of the neighbors, from which we observe a
pattern: The owners left for work on weekdays and stayed
at home over weekends. Furthermore, we can infer the daily
routines easily: The owner got up at 7 am, left for work
around 9 am, and returned home around 6 pm on Friday.
In conclusion, AMR meters allow similar sensitive infer-
ences as smart meters. What’s worse is that AMR enables

6. DEFENSE STRATEGIES
Automatic Meter Readers are vulnerable to spooﬁng at-
tacks and privacy breaches because packets are sent in plain-
text. We discuss a few strategies to improve the security and
privacy of meters. The strongest level of protection would
require a redesign of the communication protocol as outlined
in Section 6.2. There are, however, possible jamming-based
defenses for legacy meters that can raise the bar for attacks,
and can be deployed more rapidly at a lower cost.
6.1 Spooﬁng Defenses for Legacy Meters
A few strategies are available to mitigate RF spooﬁng
attacks for deployed meters without modifying the meters.
The ﬁrst one is radio ﬁngerprinting techniques, which can
diﬀerentiate amongst transmitters (e.g., real meters or at-
tackers in this case) by exploiting device levels imperfec-
tions [27] or unique channel responses [28]. Secondly, anomaly
detection over a collection of meter readings can identify a
sudden usage change and raise an alarm to perform a spoof-
ing investigation. Furthermore, utility personnel can check
the meter reading in person occasionally to detect spooﬁng
attacks.
6.2 Cryptographic Mechanisms
A complete solution would use cryptographic mechanisms
to achieve authenticity, integrity, and conﬁdentiality. For
instance, the data packets can be encrypted using standard
block encryption algorithms and augmented with a digital
signature for authentication. As such, an attacker cannot
casually eavesdrop the wireless communication and obtain
sensitive power consumption data of consumers. Without
the private key of the meter, the attacker cannot forge the
signature of meters and claim arbitrary meter readings. It
would also be a good practice to transmit a meter reading
only when needed. For example, letting a drive-by reader
wake up AMR meters appears more appropriate.

Adopting the standard security practices is an eﬀective
solution. However, implementing such a defense requires
the replacement of AMR meters with new meters or at least
an upgrade of the ﬁrmware of all deployed AMR meters.
6.3
Jammer add-on
In systems deployed at the scale of million units, the cost
of installation may outweigh the hardware cost of the de-
vices. We are unaware of any remote ﬁrmware update ca-
pability for these meters. Thus, a ﬁrmware upgrade would
require skilled maintenance staﬀ to work on each meter. To
substantially reduce the cost of such an upgrade, it is possi-
ble to package a protection mechanism into a separate add-
on device, which can be physically attached and secured to
a meter by lower-skilled personnel than a ﬁrmware upgrade.
The central component of this add-on device is a Privacy
Preserving Jammer (PPJ ), which can prevent continuous
RF eavesdropping on packets in plaintext by masking me-
ter transmissions. The PPJ continuously monitors channels
and emits a jamming signal immediately after it detects a
packet transmitted by the target meter to prevent eaves-
dropping. Meanwhile, to allow drive-by or walk-by meter
reading, the PPJ can be temporarily deactivated remotely
by authorized meter readers for a period just long enough
to allow privileged meter reading.
Jamming Parameters. To reduce the complexity and
cost, PPJ utilizes a narrowband transceiver that can listen
or transmit only on one channel. The PPJ cycles through
the meter’s channel hopping sequence and emits a protocol-
speciﬁc jamming signal to mask the data packets. Note that
the proper channel sequence can be identiﬁed by searching
for transmissions on each channel during initialization, or it
can be acquired as prior knowledge from meter companies.
To eﬀectively obscure AMR data packets, the PPJ trans-
mits over the packet channel bandwidth (200 kHz) (shown
in Fig. 14) for the entirety of a packet (5.8 ms). The jam-
mer power should be larger than the meter’s, but within
FCC regulation. By mounting the PPJ close to the meter,
the eavesdropper’s ability to decode packets becomes inde-

pendent of their location. Given any far-ﬁeld eavesdropper
location, the jammer-to-signal (J/S) ratio at the eavesdrop-
per will always be greater than 1 (i.e., J/S > 0 dB), which
represents ample distortion to prevent OOK communication
(i.e., BER = 0.5) [29].
The PPJ minimizes its interference with other devices op-
erating in the 915-MHz ISM band and obeys FCC regula-
tions. The FCC limits the peak output power for frequency
hopping to 30 dBm and places no restriction on duty cy-
cle [30]. The PPJ transmits at a power level less than 0
dBm (yet still greater than the AMR meter’s transmission
level). It overlays its jamming signals with meter transmis-
sions and remains silent when no data is transmitted, thus
greatly reducing any interference.
Deactivation Protocol. To support drive-by meter read-
ing, the PPJ can be deactivated by an authorized reader,
following the three-way handshake protocol illustrated in
Fig. 15. The protocol requires three messages, and the third
one ensures that the drive-by truck conﬁrms the deactiva-
tion before the PPJ stops jamming. All three messages use
basic signatures for authentication, and they are exchanged
on the control channel (an unused channel around 915 MHz,
e.g., 914.2 MHz). To ensure reception of the ﬁrst deactiva-
tion request message, the PPJ can periodically switch to the
control channel for listening, and the deactivation message
can employ a preamble long enough for the PPJ to detect.
Experiments. We conducted defense experiments in the
same apartment as the eavesdropping experiments in Sec-
tion 4. We programmed one USRP as an RF sniﬀer and
one as a PPJ. As before, an antenna for the RF sniﬀer was
mounted against a window to collect data from the author’s
meter. The PPJ was placed close to the author’s meter and
approximately 3m away from the RF sniﬀer. We studied our
defense strategies against two RF sniﬀers: one is a narrow-
band RF sniﬀer hopping through channels and the other is a
wideband sniﬀer that monitors all channels simultaneously.
Using a narrowband RF sniﬀer, without turning on the
PPJ, we were able to receive about 2 packets per hour on
each channel, as shown in Fig. 16 (a). Once we turn on the
PPJ, no packets can be received on any channels. To study
the relationship between jamming bandwidth and the pph,
we implemented a bandlimited jammer, which continuously
jammed at 910-920 MHz, as shown in Figure 16. We ob-
served that we blocked all packets in this band, and reduced
the number of received packets in neighboring channels.
