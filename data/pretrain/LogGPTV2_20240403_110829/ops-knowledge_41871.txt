User:  What is two-factor authentication (2FA) and how is it configured and managed?
Assistant: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security measure that requires users to provide two different authentication factors, usually a password and another piece of information used to verify identity, such as fingerprints, mobile phone verification codes or hardware tokens. Doing so increases security and prevents account hacking or hijacking. To configure and manage 2FA, you first need to access the security settings of the account or service you are using. Usually there will be an option on the account settings or profile page to enable 2FA. Users then need to select the type of 2FA they want, such as verification via SMS, app-generated code, hardware token, etc. After the configuration is complete, the user needs to provide an additional verification code or information when logging in in order to authenticate through 2FA. For a business or organization, managing 2FA often requires the use of an enterprise-grade authentication solution. This could involve deploying hardware tokens or providing licenses for employee mobile apps, among other things. Administrators need to ensure that 2FA policies control access and understand the pros and cons of the various factors used for authentication. Additionally, administrators need to provide training and support on 2FA to familiarize employees with the steps and best practices for using it.
