**Networking**

**TN3270 Overview**
- **Imagining a World with Telnet:**
  - Imagine a world where telnet still exists.
  - Imagine no more!
  - TN3270 is similar to Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) of the past, using a 'stream' for communication.

**Field Attributes**
- **Screen Characteristics:**
  - The screen is 1920 bytes long.
  - Each byte can be a field attribute that identifies:
    - Color
    - Locked/Unlocked (Protected)
    - Visible/Invisible (Hidden)

**Locked Field Length**
- **Example:**
  - USERPG01

**Identifying Challenges**
- **Identification Difficulties:**
  - No support in nmap or other tools.
  - Hard to identify screens without an emulator.
  - Hidden fields and protected values are difficult to detect.

**Until Now!**
- **New TN3270 Library for NMAP:**
  - Emulates a real 3270 screen.
  - Allows you to:
    - Connect
    - Show the screen
    - Send commands
    - Detect hidden fields!

**VTAM Application IDs and Macros**
- **Samesies:**
  - VTAM Application IDs
  - VTAM Macros

**Hidden Fields!**
- **Detection:**
  - New capabilities to detect hidden fields.

**But Wait, There's More!**
- **LUA and Python Support:**
  - I wrote one in LUA, why not Python?

**tn3270lib**
- **Features:**
  - Supports tn3270 (not E).
  - Creates a tn3270 object.
  - Allows for sending commands.
  - Similar functionality to nmap, but now introduces new features.

**Three Modes**
- **Proxy/Passthrough (Man-in-the-Middle):**
  - Mirrors a targeted mainframe.
  - Connects, scrapes the screen, and shares it on your machine.
  - Pre-grabs screens based on expected commands.
  - Default: TSO logon screen.

**SET’n’3270**
- **SSL Support:**
  - Supports SSL, which is cool because clients do not check certificates (no warnings or anything).

**More Tools**

- **Mainframe Brute:**
  - Slower but more reliable.

**Network Job Entry (NJE)**
- **Overview:**
  - Also known as NJE.
  - Runs on ports 175 and 2252 (SSL).
  - Developed in the 80s.

**How It Works:**
- **Initial Setup:**
  - Systems configure JES to tell them:
    - Where to connect.
    - Who they will accept connections from.
- **Configuration Details:**
  - Number of nodes.
  - Our node name.
  - Other nodes and their IP addresses.

**Connection Process:**
- **From: Network Job Entry (NJE) Formats and Protocols (SA32-0988-00):**
  - "OPEN"
  - Connect TCPIP
  - "ACK"
