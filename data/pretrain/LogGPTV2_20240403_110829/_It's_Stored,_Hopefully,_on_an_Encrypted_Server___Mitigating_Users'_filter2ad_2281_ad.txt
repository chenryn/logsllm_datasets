was the number of passwords that need to be remembered.
Most participants had experience with using biometrics. A
third of participants expressed liking biometrics due to their
convenience. Five mentioned trust issues with biometrics.
Confusion About WebAuthn:
The provided re-
sources [19, 24, 27, 64] helped to identify further miscon-
ceptions. During discussion, two participants expressed the
misunderstanding that WebAuthn was a platform where you
create an account, which then handles your logins for you.
Two other participants confused passwordless WebAuthn with
two-factor authentication (the biometric functions as a second
factor). Three participants showed misunderstandings sur-
rounding hardware security tokens. One of them interpreted
the token as a device to store the biometric. Conﬁrming a
ﬁnding from previous work [13], two participants thought the
token was an external ﬁngerprint scanner. Three participants
misinterpreted the challenge that is signed with the private
key during authentication as a strong password. In general,
fallback authentication was a major concern.
4.3 Desirable Features of Notiﬁcations
Text Content: We observed two central features in most of
the notiﬁcations participants created. Participants tended to
stress either the 1(cid:13) convenience or the 2(cid:13) security of biomet-
ric WebAuthn. Overall, 7 participants’ notiﬁcations described
WebAuthn as fast, 9 as easy, and 21 as safe and/or secure.
The 3(cid:13) storage location of the biometric data was a key
component of the notiﬁcations. 16 participants mentioned
where the biometric was stored, and 13 included who had
access to their biometric data. Biometric data being “only
stored on your device” was the most common wording, used
by 13 participants. Three participants chose the wording “it
never leaves your device,” and one used “it is only stored lo-

cally.” Three participants mentioned that “no one except you”
has access to your biometrics. That “no third parties” have
access to biometric data was mentioned by three participants.
Four explained that the “the website” has no access either.
The fact that 4(cid:13) hackers cannot get a hold of biometric
data was included by four participants. 5(cid:13) Comparison to
passwords was a common approach participants used. From
a convenience point of view, WebAuthn eliminates the neces-
sity to remember many passwords, which was mentioned by
11 participants. Seven said passwords are easy to hack, and
three said that the biometrics in WebAuthn cannot be hacked.
A controversial point followed by an enthusiastic discussion
was whether it would be beneﬁcial to include that WebAuthn
is supported and co-developed by 6(cid:13) popular brands like
Microsoft, Google, or Apple. Participants preferred not to
include technical details. The complete list of notiﬁcation
elements can be found in our online appendix [31].
Supporting Visuals: The most common style of the sup-
porting images participants drew was a protocol ﬂow with
arrows representing the inner workings or steps a user would
have to take to log in with WebAuthn. A third of participants
preferred to draw a representation of a login interface.
The most common elements of images, drawn by 16 partic-
ipants, were personal devices like 1(cid:13) phones or computers.
15 participants drew 2(cid:13) biometric features, such as ﬁnger-
prints, eyes, or faces. To better explain the communication
between the device and the website, 7 participants drafted a
representation of a 3(cid:13) website or a server. Popular visual
metaphors were 4(cid:13) physical keys and locks. Adding to the
discussion about trustworthiness of certain 5(cid:13) brands, 2 par-
ticipants added logos or mentioned well-known brands like
Google and Apple. To convey that WebAuthn is not tied
to speciﬁc websites, 4 participants included representations
of services like Facebook or Amazon. Interestingly, even
though the 6(cid:13) storage location of the biometric data played
a central role in the written explanations, only 5 participants
represented this in their images. The complete list of drawing
elements can be found in our online appendix [31].
Consensus Notiﬁcations: At the end of each focus group,
we asked the group to reach consensus on the central points
of a notiﬁcation. From this, we identiﬁed four key aspects:
1. Security:
(a) WebAuthn is safe, secure, and private.
(b) My biometric data is stored locally on my phone.
Nobody has access to it. It cannot be hacked.
(c) WebAuthn was developed by trusted companies.
2. Convenience: WebAuthn is fast, easy, and convenient.
3. Comparison to Passwords: WebAuthn is better than
passwords, which have security/convenience drawbacks.
4. Availability: WebAuthn can be used on different web-
sites, but you cannot access your accounts from multiple
devices (if you have not registered them ﬁrst).
We used these items as the starting point for the notiﬁcations
we designed for Study 3 to address these misconceptions.
5 Study 3: Comparison Study
Study 3 had two goals. First, we aimed to compare the bio-
metric WebAuthn notiﬁcations co-designed with participants
in Study 2. These notiﬁcations themselves aimed to address
misconceptions identiﬁed in Study 1. Second, we wanted to
compare biometric WebAuthn to (i) non-biometric WebAuthn
using a smartphone as a platform authenticator and (ii) tradi-
tional site-speciﬁc passwords. To this end, we conducted a
between-subject protocol similar to Study 1 (Section 3).
5.1 Method
Figure 3a summarizes the protocol. Participants were ran-
domly assigned to one of three groups specifying that they
use biometric WebAuthn, non-biometric WebAuthn (e.g., un-
lock PIN, pattern, or password), or a site-speciﬁc password.
Additionally, biometric WebAuthn participants were assigned
one of six different notiﬁcations addressing misconceptions.
The notiﬁcation was shown directly before account creation.
Participants were again recruited via Proliﬁc, and those from
Studies 1 and 2 were excluded. Compensation was $5 each
for the registration and authentication parts.
Design of Biometric WebAuthn Notiﬁcations: We de-
veloped the notiﬁcations based on the consensus participants
came to in Study 2. “Security” and “convenience” were the
two broad categories those participants wanted to emphasize.
We developed baseline language for those concepts through
an 80-participant pre-study following the same protocol as
Study 3. We compared “Fast and easy. . . ,” “Safe and se-
cure. . . ,” and “Safe, secure, fast, and easy. . . ,” each followed
by “. . . sign-in with your ﬁngerprint or face” (displayed in our
online appendix [31]).
The majority of the participants in the pre-study rated “fast
and easy” as their favorite, so we used this language for all
notiﬁcations in Study 3. Our baseline notiﬁcation, Biometric-
Control, contained only this language. The ﬁve other notiﬁca-
tions appended other concepts participants in the focus groups
wished to emphasize, using the terminology that emerged
from the focus groups:
• Biometric-Brands: “Backed by Microsoft, Google, and
Apple.”
• Biometric-Hacked: “Unlike passwords it can’t be hacked.”
• Biometric-Leaves: “Your ﬁngerprint or face never leaves
• Biometric-Stored: “Your ﬁngerprint or face is only stored
your personal device.”
on your personal device.”
• Biometric-Shared: “Your ﬁngerprint or face is never shared
with ExampleTech or third parties.”
Most notiﬁcations address where the biometric is stored,
a key concern from the previous studies. Biometric-Hacked
also compares WebAuthn to passwords. Even though the
trust aspect Biometric-Brands represents only appeared in two
focus groups, we tested it since it spurred substantial discus-

sion in those groups. The Password condition saw a typical
password-creation screen (Figure 3b). The Non-biometric
condition saw the parallel “Fast and easy sign-in with your
device’s PIN, pattern, or password” (Figure 3c). Figure 4
shows the notiﬁcations for the six biometric conditions.
Survey Design: The surveys for both the registration and
authentication phases were largely the same as in Study 1.
However, in the registration survey, participants who success-
fully registered were also asked questions aimed at under-
standing their impressions of WebAuthn after being presented
with all of the different notiﬁcations. The order in which the
notiﬁcations appeared was randomized in order to avoid any
ordering bias. Additionally, participants were only shown all
of the notiﬁcations after they answered all questions relating
to misconceptions in order to avoid priming them. As with
Study 1, participants were not expected to have any technical
expertise or prior knowledge of WebAuthn. Survey questions
sought to understand participants’ initial expectations.
Analysis Methods: Whereas Study 1 was primarily quali-
tative, Study 3’s between-subjects design enabled quantitative
comparisons across conditions. When comparing either nu-
merical variables (e.g., timing) or ordinal responses on Likert
scales, we ﬁrst performed an omnibus Kruskal-Wallis H test
(KW). In cases where the omnibus test was not signiﬁcant,
we report the distribution of responses across all conditions.
If the omnibus test was signiﬁcant, we performed (and report)
pairwise, post-hoc Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. For categorical
data, we used Fisher’s Exact Test (FET). We also asked a
few questions that compared all notiﬁcations within-subjects.
Because each participant answered all questions in a repeated-
measures design, we use the Friedman test, performing pair-
wise, post-hoc tests using Eisinga et al.’s method [17]. We set
α = .05. To control for multiple testing, we corrected p-values
using the Benjamini-Hochberg method within each family of
tests, as well as within each set of pairwise contrasts.
5.2 Participants
A total of 345 participants completed the registration phase,
while an additional 29 failed to register for an account (simi-
larly to Study 1, due to incompatible hardware, an incompati-
ble web browser, or the phone failing to recognize a ﬁnger-
print). Of the 345 participants who successfully registered,
322 returned for the authentication phase, and 303 authen-
ticated successfully. The registration phase (including the
associated survey) took a median of 21 minutes, while the au-
thentication phase took a median of 15 minutes. Between 40
and 49 participants were randomly assigned to each condition.
Of the 345 participants who successfully registered, 197
were men, 143 were women, 4 were non-binary, and 1 pre-
ferred not to answer. Participants were again relatively young,
with 19% age 18–24, 39% age 25–34, 25% age 35-44, 11%
age 45–54, and the remaining 5% age 55+. Among partici-
pants, 24% had a post-graduate degree, 40% had a college
degree, 23% had completed some college without a degree,
and 13% ﬁnished high school. Finally, 65% of participants
had no background in technology/IT, 33% did, and 2% pre-
ferred not to answer. Asked if they had “heard of the terms
WebAuthn or FIDO2,” 18% reported they had. Most of them
(79%) had ﬁrst encountered it within the last year.
Among participants, 44% had a Samsung phone, 15% a
Huawei phone, and 12% a Google phone. Across all 345
participants, 95% had enabled ﬁngerprint unlock, 24% face
unlock, and 5% iris unlock. Participants used either a four-
digit PIN (48%), pattern (26%), PIN of another length (22%),
or password (8%) as their non-biometric fallback mechanism.
5.3 Registration and Authentication
The 44 participants in the Password condition created an
ExampleTech-speciﬁc password, of which 6 appeared (based
on heuristics) to have been auto-generated by Chrome. Fol-
lowing recommendations from the literature [55], we required
passwords be 8+ characters long and have a zxcvbn [61]
strength score of 3+ (resisting ≥ 108 guesses). The median
PGS [58] min_auto guess number was 1013, and the mean
zxcvbn strength score was 3.4. The 40 participants in the
Non-biometric WebAuthn condition used the method they
typically use for unlocking their phone: a four-digit PIN (21
participants), pattern (14), PIN of another length (4), or pass-
word (1).
Most participants assigned to a biometric condition used
their ﬁngerprint. Of those 261 participants, 256 authenticated
with a ﬁngerprint, three with their iris, and two with their face.
This preference toward ﬁngerprints was also evident in the
methods participants had enabled for phone unlocking.
The time it took participants to register an account on
ExampleTech varied across conditions (KW χ2(7) = 104.9,

p < .001). The median time for the six biometric conditions
ranged from 4.6 to 5.1 seconds, compared to 9.7 seconds
for Non-biometric and 22.6 seconds for Password. These
differences were statistically signiﬁcant between all six bio-
metric conditions and both Non-biometric (all p < .001) and
Password (all p < .001). Registration required a median of a
single attempt in all conditions. Participants in all conditions
found the registration process highly usable, with a median
score of 90.0 on the System Usability Scale (SUS).
The time it took to authenticate a week later also varied
across conditions (KW χ2(7) = 32.1, p < .001). The median
time to authenticate in the six biometric conditions ranged
from 3.9 – 4.9 seconds, compared to 5.9 seconds for Password
and 7.6 seconds for Non-biometric. The difference between
Non-biometric and all seven other conditions was statistically
signiﬁcant (all p ≤ .001), though no other pairwise differ-
ences (including compared to Password) were signiﬁcant. As
with registration, participants in all conditions found the au-
thentication process highly usable, with a median SUS score
