    var a = [1, 'abc'] as [number, string];
    var [b, c] = a;
    [a].forEach(([d, e]) => {
        alert(d);
        alert(e);
    });
There's something amiss with the typing in the above code snippet. TypeScript
can figure out that `b` is a `number` and `c` is a `string`, it can even
figure out that the `callbackFn` of my `forEach` is a `(value: [number,
string], index: number, ...) => void`, but it says `d` and `e` are `any`. I'd
have expected it to also know that these are `number` and `string`
respectively.
