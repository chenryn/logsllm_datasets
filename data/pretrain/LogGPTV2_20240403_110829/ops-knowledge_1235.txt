User: Hey I've been using Linux for a while and thought it was time to finally dive into shell scripting.
The problem is I've failed to find any significant advantage of using Bash over something like Perl or Python. Are there any performance or power differences between the two? I'd figure Python/Perl would be more well suited as far as power and efficiency goes.
Assistant: If you want to execute programs installed on the machine, nothing beats bash. You can always make a system call from Perl or Python, but I find it to be a hassle to read return values, etc. 
And since you know it will work pretty much anywhere throughout all of of time...
