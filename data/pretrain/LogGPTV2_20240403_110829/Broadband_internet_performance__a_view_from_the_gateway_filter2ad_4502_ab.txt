### 3. Data Transfer Rates and Network Utilization
Cable users may experience data transfer rates (both download and upload) that exceed their contracted rates, especially during the initial part of a transfer. The actual rate received by a cable user can vary depending on the network utilization of other users connected to the same headend. The Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS) controls the transmission rates of cable modems. For example, Comcast employs a mechanism where, when a CMTS port becomes congested, it ensures fairness by scheduling heavy users into a lower priority queue [3].

### 4. Measurement Infrastructure
This section describes the measurement infrastructure we deployed and the datasets we collected. We first explain the need for deploying measurement infrastructure directly at the gateway, then detail the SamKnows and BISMark (Broadband Internet Service Benchmark) gateway deployments.

#### 4.1 Why Deploy at the Gateway?
Deploying measurements at gateway devices offers several advantages over other techniques:
- **Direct Measurement of ISPâ€™s Access Link**: The gateway is positioned behind the modem, between the access link and all other devices in the home network (Figure 2). This allows us to isolate the effects of confounding factors such as wireless interference and cross-traffic.
- **Continual/Longitudinal Measurements**: These measurements enable us to meaningfully characterize the performance of ISPs for individual users over time.
- **Versatile Instrumentation**: We can instrument a single home with different hardware and configurations, allowing us to explore the effects of multiple factors on performance. In some cases, we even swapped modems to study their impact while keeping other network conditions constant.

Table 1 summarizes the challenges and how deploying gateways addresses them.

| Confounding Factor | How We Address It |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Wireless Effects    | Use a wired connection to the modem. |
| Cross Traffic       | Measure cross traffic and avoid or account for it. |
| Load on Gateway     | Use a well-provisioned gateway. |
| Location of Server  | Choose a nearby server. |
| End-to-End Path     | Focus on characterizing the last mile. |
| Gateway Configuration | Test configuration in both practice and controlled settings. |

#### 4.2 Gateway Deployments
Our study uses two independent gateway deployments: the FCC/SamKnows deployment and the BISMark deployment.

##### 4.2.1 SamKnows Deployment
The FCC/SamKnows deployment collected data from over 4,200 users across different ISPs in the United States as of January 2011, with the current number exceeding 10,000 users. Our goal with this deployment is to achieve breadth, classifying a large set of users across diverse ISPs and geographical locations.

- **Platform**: Netgear WNR3500L RangeMax Wireless-N Gigabit router with a 480 MHz MIPS processor, 8 MB flash storage, and 64 MB RAM.
- **Data Collection Period**: December 14, 2010, to January 14, 2011.
- **ISPs and Devices**: Table 2 lists the ISPs, the total number of gateways, and the number of active gateways (those reporting more than 100 throughput measurements).

| ISP         | Total Gateways | Active Gateways |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Comcast     | 864            | 560             |

| Charter     | 187            | 51              |
| Cablevision | 104            | 53              |

##### 4.2.2 BISMark Deployment
The BISMark deployment collects measurements from a smaller, focused group of users in Atlanta. Our goal with this deployment is to achieve depth, allowing us to take detailed measurements and conduct specific experiments with different settings and configurations.

- **Platform**: NOX Box, a small-form-factor computer with an ALIX 2D13 6-inch by 6-inch single board computer, 500MHz AMD Geode processor, 256 MB RAM, and at least 2 GB of flash memory. The NOX Box runs Debian Linux.
- **Measurements**: Table 3 lists the types of measurements BISMark collects, including throughput, latency, packet loss, and jitter.

| Parameter           | Type          | Frequency | Protocol | Comments                         |
|---------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| Latency             | End-to-end    | 600 pkts/hr | UDP      | MLab                             |
| Loss                | End-to-end    | 5 pkts/hr | ICMP     | MLab                             |

| Jitter              | End-to-end    | 600 pkts/hr | UDP      | MLab                             |
| Downstream Throughput | Single-thread HTTP | 1 hour | TCP      | MLab, passive throughput         |
| Upstream Throughput | Single-thread HTTP | 1 hour | TCP      | MLab, passive throughput         |
| Capacity            | Bi-directional HTTP | 2 hours | TCP      | MLab, idle link                  |

### 4.3 Measurement Techniques
We evaluate several methods for measuring key metrics such as bulk transfer capacity and latency. The SamKnows gateways measure bulk transfer capacity using an HTTP client that spawns three parallel threads, increasing the likelihood of saturating the access link. A "warmup" transfer is performed until throughput stabilizes to ensure accurate measurements. Download tests use the same TCP connection to exploit the "warmed up" session, lasting about 30 seconds with snapshots of byte transfers every five seconds.

Latency is measured in multiple ways:
- **End-to-End Latency**: Using a UDP client that sends about six hundred packets per hour to servers and measures latency and packet loss, and using ICMP ping to the same set of servers at a rate of five packets per hour.
- **Last Mile Latency**: Measuring latency to the first IP hop inside the ISP.
- **Latency Under Load**: Measuring end-to-end latency during both upload and download tests.

Before any test, the software checks for cross traffic on the outgoing interface. If traffic exceeds 64 Kbits/s down or 32 Kbits/s up, the test is aborted.

### 4.4 BISMark Details
BISMark includes gateways in the home, a centralized management and data collection server, and several measurement servers. The gateway performs passive and active measurements, anonymizes the results, and sends them back to the central repository for analysis. It also periodically "phones home" to update configurations and install software updates.

### 4.5 Challenges and Considerations
Gateway deployments face significant challenges, including resource constraints and the need for remote maintenance and management. These devices are deployed in homes of real users, adding logistical complexity. We focus on the details of the platforms and the measurements collected, omitting logistical challenges due to space constraints.
