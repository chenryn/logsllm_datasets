cases, upload) at rates that are higher than the contracted ones, for
an initial part of a transfer. The actual rate that a cable user receives
will vary with the network utilization of other users connecting to
the same headend. The CMTS controls the rate at which cable
modems transmit. For instance, Comcast describes that when a
CMTS’s port becomes congested, it ensures fairness by scheduling
heavy users on a lower priority queue [3].

deploying measurement infrastructure directly at the gateway; then,
we describe the SamKnows and BISMark (Broadband Internet Ser-
vice benchMark) gateway deployments.
4.1 Why a Gateway?
Deploying measurements at gateway devices offers the following
advantages over the other techniques discussed in Section 2:
• Direct measurement of the ISP’s access link: the gateway sits
behind the modem; between the access link and all other devices
at the home network as shown in Figure2. This allows us to iso-
late the effect of confounding factors such as wireless effects and
cross trafﬁc.
• Continual/longitudinal measurements, which allow us to mean-
ingfully characterize performance of ISPs for individual users.
• The ability to instrument a single home with different hardware
and conﬁgurations, which allows us to explore the effects of mul-
tiple factors on performance. In some deployments, we were even
able to swap modems to study their effect on performance, hold-
ing all other conditions about the network setup equal.
Table 1 summarizes the challenges involved in conducting such a
study, and how deploying gateways solves them. We now describe
the two gateway deployments in our study.
4.2 Gateway Deployments
Our study uses two independent gateway deployments. The ﬁrst,
the FCC/SamKnows gateway deployment, collected data from over
4,200 users across different ISPs in the United States, as of Jan-
uary 2011. This deployment currently has over 10,000 users. Our
goal in using the measurements from this deployment is to achieve
breadth: we aim to classify a large set of users across a diverse
set of ISPs and geographical locations. The second, the BISMark
deployment, collects measurements from a smaller, focused group
of users from different ISPs and service plans in Atlanta. Our goal
with the measurements from this deployment is to achieve depth:
this platform allows us to take measurements with detailed knowl-
edge of how every gateway is deployed; we can also take repeated
measurements and conduct speciﬁc experiments from the same de-
ployment with different settings and conﬁgurations.

along a path with a congestion-aware protocol like TCP. In Sec-
tion 5.1, we evaluate several methods for measuring these metrics.
The SamKnows gateways measure bulk transfer capacity using
an HTTP client that spawns three parallel threads; this approach
increases the likelihood of saturating the access link. The soft-
ware ﬁrst executes a “warmup” transfer until throughput is steady
to ensure that the throughput measurements are not affected by TCP
slow start. The download tests that follows use the same TCP con-
nection to exploit the “warmed up” session. The tests last for about
30 seconds; the software reports snapshots of how many bytes were
transferred for every ﬁve-second interval.
The gateways also measure different aspects of latency: (1) end-
to-end latency; (2) latency to the ﬁrst IP hop inside the ISP (last
mile latency); and (3) latency coinciding with an upload or down-
load (latency under load). They measure end-to-end latency in two
ways: (1) Using a UDP client that sends about six hundred packets
an hour to the servers and measures latency and packet loss, and
(2) using ICMP ping to the same set of servers at the rate of ﬁve
packets per hour. To measure latency under load, the gateway mea-
sures end-to-end latency during both the upload and the download
measurements. They also measure jitter based on RFC 5481 [28]
and the time to download the home page of ten popular websites.
Before any test begins, the measurement software checks whether
cross trafﬁc on the outgoing interface exceeds 64 Kbits/s down or
32 Kbits/s up; if trafﬁc exceeds this threshold, it aborts the test.
4.2.2 BISMark
BISMark comprises gateways in the home, a centralized man-
agement and data collection server, and several measurement
servers. The gateway performs passive and active measurements
and anonymizes the results before sending them back to the cen-
tral repository for further analysis. This gateway also periodically
“phones home” to allow the central repository to communicate
back through network address translators, to update network con-
ﬁgurations and to install software updates. The gateway is based
on the NOX Box [31], a small-form-factor computer resembling
an off-the-shelf home router/gateway. The NOX Box hardware
is an ALIX 2D13 6-inch by 6-inch single board computer with a
500MHz AMD Geode processor, 256 MB of RAM and at least
2 GB of ﬂash memory. The Nox Box runs Debian Linux.
Table 3 lists the measurements that BISMark collects.1 We col-
lect throughput, latency, packet loss, and jitter measurements.
BISMark measures bulk transfer capacity by performing an
HTTP download and upload for 15 seconds using a single-threaded
TCP connection once every 30 minutes, regardless of cross traf-
ﬁc. We do this to have more readings, and to account for
cross-trafﬁc, we count bytes transferred by reading directly from
/proc/net/dev, and compute the “passive throughput” as the

Gateway deployments entail signiﬁcant challenges concerning
the resource constraints of the gateway platform and the need to re-
motely maintain and manage the devices (especially because these
devices are deployed in homes of “real users”); we omit discussion
of these logistical challenges due to lack of space and instead focus
on the details of the platforms and the measurements we collect.
4.2.1 SamKnows
SamKnows specializes in performance evaluation of access net-
works; it has studied access ISP performance in the United King-
dom and has now contracted with the FCC for a similar study in
the United States. SamKnows deployed gateways in each partici-
pant’s home either directly behind the home user’s router or behind
the home wireless router; the devices can be updated and man-
aged remotely. The gateway is a Netgear WNR3500L RangeMax
Wireless-N Gigabit router with a 480 MHz MIPS processor, 8 MB
of ﬂash storage, and 64 MB of RAM. We use active measurement
data from the SamKnows study from December 14, 2010 to Jan-
uary 14, 2011. This dataset comprises measurements from 4,200
devices that are deployed across sixteen different ISPs and hun-
dreds of cities in the United States. The volunteers for the study
were recruited through http://www.testmyisp.com. Fig-
ure 3 shows a map of the deployment.
Table 2 lists the ISPs that we study, the number of gateways de-
ployed in them, and the number of gateways that report more than
100 throughput measurements. Gateways are rolled out in phases.
These devices perform measurements less aggressively when users
are sending a lot of trafﬁc. Therefore, not all gateways report data
for the entire duration of the study. When we report averages and
95th percentile values for some metric, we only consider gateways
that have reported more than 100 measurements for that metric. We
also only consider the eight ISPs with the most gateways.
Table 3 shows the active measurements that we use from the
SamKnows deployment; some of these (e.g., last mile latency) were
inspired from our experience running them on BISMark. The gate-
ways conduct upstream and downstream measurements to servers
hosted at Measurement Lab [27] about once every two hours.
There are many ways to measure throughput, though there is no
standard method. Bauer et al. list several notions of “broadband
speed”: capacity is the total carrying capacity of the link; and the
bulk transfer capacity is the amount of data that can be transferred
