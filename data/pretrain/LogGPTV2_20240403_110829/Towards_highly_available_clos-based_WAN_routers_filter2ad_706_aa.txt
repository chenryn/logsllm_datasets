ABSTRACT
The performance and availability of cloud and content providers
often depends on the wide area networks (WANs) they use to in-
terconnect their datacenters. WAN routers, which connect to each
other using trunks (bundles of links), are sometimes built using
an internal Clos topology connecting merchant-silicon switches.
As such, these routers are susceptible to internal link and switch
failures, resulting in reduced capacity and low availability. Based
on the observation that today’s WAN routers use relatively sim-
ple trunk wiring and routing techniques, we explore the design of
novel wiring and more sophisticated routing techniques to increase
failure resilience. Specifically, we describe techniques to 1) optimize
trunk wiring to increase effective internal router capacity so as to
be resilient to internal failures, 2) compute the effective capacity un-
der different failure patterns, and 3) use these to compute compact
routing tables under different failure patterns, since switches have
limited routing table sizes. Our evaluations show that our approach
can mask failures of up to 75% of switches in some cases without
exceeding routing table limits, whereas competing techniques can
sometimes lose half of a WAN router’s capacity with a single failure.

Figure 1: Globally-distributed WANs and WAN routers.
1 INTRODUCTION
Large cloud and content providers (like Google, Facebook, Net-
flix, and Microsoft) are expanding their own wide-area networks
(WANs) to meet service-level latency and throughput objectives
and to achieve high availability, all at low cost. These globally-
distributed WANs consist of dozens of sites [19, 25]. At each site
(Figure 1), one or more WAN routers forward (a) ingress and egress
traffic to one or more datacenters at the site and (b) transit traffic
between WAN sites. To achieve this, each WAN router connects to
datacenters and to WAN routers at the same or other sites using
trunks, which are logical collections of physical links that provide
high aggregate capacity [34].
The design of the WAN topology and its routing is crucial to the
performance and availability of the entire WAN. WANs must carry
large traffic volumes, often in the terabits per second (Tbps), so they
incorporate novel router designs that achieve high performance
and high utilization at low cost. However, the effect of small fail-
ures within WAN routers, or within trunks, can disproportionately
degrade the capacity of WAN routers, resulting in lower service
availability or in degraded user-perceived performance. In this pa-
per, we focus on the failure resilience of a common type of WAN
router designed using a non-blocking Clos [12] topology.
Clos-Based WAN Routers. In the last decade, some content
providers and router vendors have designed high-aggregate-
capacity WAN routers by arranging merchant-silicon switching
chips (e.g., the Broadcom Trident series [24], Arista 7050X3
series [21]) in a topology shown in Figure 1. In this topology, traffic
ingresses and egresses the WAN router at external ports attached
to the lower half of the lower layer of switches (also called layer-1
or L1 switches). Incoming traffic traverses internal links, bounces
off layer-2 or L2 switches, and then exits an external port towards
a datacenter border router or another WAN router. The use of
commodity merchant silicon ensures low cost, and the design of
the topology ensures non-blocking performance; a non-blocking
switch or router can satisfy any traffic matrix, which specifies the
volume of traffic between each ingress-egress trunk pair.
The aggregate capacity of the Clos-Based WAN router (hence-
forth, simply WAN router) is a function of the number of switches
used, which itself is a function of the switching chip radix (the num-
ber of switch ports) and the per-port capacity. With a 16-port switch,
the WAN router will require 16 L1 switches and 8 L2 switches to
achieve the non-blocking property and will have 128 full-duplex

external ports [19]. If each port can support 40 Gbps of traffic, the
entire WAN router has a capacity of 5.12 Tbps.
Internal Routing in Clos-Based WAN Routers. Today, WAN
routers use a simple internal routing strategy. For example, consider
Figure 2 which depicts a smaller WAN router constructed using
4-port switches. This router interconnects three external trunks,
A, B and C with, respectively, 2, 2, and 4 links. Each link in this
topology, whether internal or external, has one unit of capacity.
Suppose that 2 units of traffic enter trunk C destined for A. The
ingress L1 switch uses ECMP-based forwarding, in which ingress
traffic is evenly load-balanced across the two internal links towards
two L2 switches. These L2 switches each then forward the traffic
to the switch connected to trunk A’s links.
The Impact of Internal Failures in a WAN Router. In a WAN
router, one or more L1 or L2 switches and/or one or more internal
links can fail (external links can also fail, and, while we do not
consider such failures in this paper, our approach extends to this
case (§7)). Such a failure can reduce the effective capacity of the
switch. In Figure 2, the failure of a single internal link (out of a total
of 8 internal links) reduces the router’s effective capacity by 50%,
and the router only satisfies one unit of the demand from C to A.
To understand how this example generalizes to more realistic
settings, Table 1 shows the reduction in effective capacity in a
128-port switch with 4 trunks for different failure configurations.
Specifically, the table shows the maximum reduction in effective
capacity across all possible traffic matrices, using a methodology
developed in this paper and described later. A 128-port switch has
8 L2 switches, 16 L1 switches, and 128 internal links. As Table 1
shows, a single internal link failure can reduce effective capacity
by 50%, and four concurrent link failures (out of 128) can result
in an effective capacity of a quarter of the original capacity. L1
switch failures can be equally catastrophic: removing 2 out of 16
L1 switch failures can reduce the effective capacity to zero for this
trunk configuration. However, the WAN router degrades gracefully
with L2 switch failures: each L2 switch failure reduces capacity by
1/8th, as it should.
Content and cloud providers strive to simultaneously achieve
high utilization (especially in a WAN where the cost of wide-area
links are high [25]) and high availability (to satisfy service-level ob-
jectives). To achieve this, WAN routers must mask as many failures
as possible, and gracefully degrade when not. This motivates our
search for techniques to improve the resilience of WAN routers.
Towards Better Failure Resilience in WAN Routers. Ideally,
a WAN router should be able to completely mask internal failures.
However, there are limits to failure masking. For example, when
Figure 3: By carefully wiring trunks, and forwarding ingress traf-
fic out on L1 switches whenever possible, a WAN router can mask
failure of an internal link.
an L1 switch fails, capacity will necessarily degrade since its ports
cannot ingress or egress traffic. Similarly, if enough L2 switches or
internal links fail, it may not be possible to mask these failures. In
these cases, we require that capacity degrade gracefully: the loss in
capacity should be proportional to the fraction of failed hardware
resources (links or switches).
To understand how to achieve these requirements, consider Fig-
ure 3 which explains how we can mask the single link failure in
Figure 2. Figure 3 illustrates that, to minimize the impact of fail-
ures, we can: (a) carefully arrange trunks across the WAN router’s
external ports, and (b) route traffic at L1 switches when possible.
These techniques can avoid the capacity degradation of Figure 2.
For example, trunk A now connects to the first and third (from the
left) L1 switch, instead of only the first L1 switch. This permits the
first L1 switch to forward traffic from C to A and send less traffic
up to the L2 switches. This early forwarding reduces the upflow
(total traffic from L1 switches to L2 switches) and can completely
mask the single link failure.
Contributions. Our paper leverages the above two insights to de-
sign topology and routing schemes to maximize failure masking
and ensure graceful degradation in WAN routers. Indeed, our ap-
proach can mask all L2 and link failures in Table 1, and gracefully
degrade L1 switch failures. To achieve this, our paper makes three
contributions.
Our first contribution (§2) is the design of minimal-upflow trunk
wiring. Re-arranging the ports assigned to each trunk (the trunk
wiring) permits early forwarding of traffic between two trunks at
the L1 switch, without even traversing internal links. However,
early forwarding is not always possible: some traffic (the upflow)
needs to traverse L2 switches. Intuitively, minimizing the upflow
can improve the ability of the WAN router to sustain capacity in the
face of L2 and internal link failures. Given a trunk configuration,
we study how to minimize the total upflow from L1 to L2 switches.
The challenge in doing this is that, in practice, while trunk configu-
rations change on day, week, or month timescales, the inter-trunk

traffic matrix can change more frequently. Thus, we need to de-
termine a trunk wiring that minimizes upflow across all possible
traffic matrices. Simply enumerating all possible traffic matrices is
infeasible at the scale of today’s WAN routers. Instead, we observe
that, given a trunk configuration, we can enumerate a smaller set of
extreme traffic matrices that dominate the set of all traffic matrices.
Using this observation, we develop a mixed-integer linear program
(MILP) formulation for the minimal-upflow trunk wiring problem.
We also prove that, for some trunk configurations, it is possible
to derive minimal-upflow trunk wiring without solving an MILP.
While our MILP formulation scales to reasonable problem sizes,
it hits scaling limits for 512-port WAN routers built from 32-port
switches. For these larger routers, we develop a fast heuristic for
trunk wiring that achieves the minimal upflow almost every time.
Our second contribution (§3) is the design of a method to com-
pute effective capacity under failures. Specifically, given a minimal-
upflow trunk wiring, we need a way to determine, for, say, failures
of links or of L1/L2 switches, the maximum capacity reduction in
the WAN router across all possible traffic matrices. This is necessary
because, in practice, a traffic engineering algorithm such as the one
used in [19, 25] requires an estimate of the residual router capacity
for a given failure pattern. Because traffic engineering needs to be
fast, it may be infeasible to run an algorithm to determine the max-
imum capacity reduction across all traffic matrices when a set of
failures occurs. Instead, we seek to pre-compute capacity reduction
for each failure pattern, but the number of possible failure patterns
can be prohibitively large. We show, however, that the symmetry
in WAN routers permits the enumeration of a small number of
canonical failure patterns, and any failure pattern is isomorphic to
one of these canonical failure patterns. We develop an algorithm to
determine a canonical failure pattern from any given failure pat-
tern and use it to enumerate all canonical failure patterns. We then
devise easily parallelizable optimization formulations to determine
the effective capacity under failure.
Our third contribution (§4) is to develop compact forwarding
tables for a minimal-upflow trunk wiring and a given failure pattern.
While today’s switches use ECMP, in which traffic is evenly load-
balanced across links, our approach requires a weighted version of
ECMP (called WCMP [40]). Unfortunately, today, the way WCMP
is achieved in chips can inflate forwarding table sizes, and switches
have limited forwarding tables. To meet table size constraints, one
can quantize the weights for different flows, which can potentially
result in lower effective capacity than computed in §3. We show
that it is possible to optimize compact forwarding tables to achieve
minimal-upflow trunk wiring without sacrificing effective capacity
under failures, and provide scalable approximations for this problem.
Our evaluations (§5) show that our approach can mask up to
6 concurrent link or L2 switch failures in a WAN router, while a
baseline wiring strategy that uses ECMP or WCMP cannot even
mask a single failure. Our approach can tolerate failures of up to
half of the L1 switches, but the baseline wiring can only tolerate 1-3
such failures. Random wiring is less effective than our approach,
often having an upflow 2-3× higher, with correspondingly lower
resilience. We also demonstrate that our approach’s resilience does
not require exceeding hardware table limits. Finally, we show that
Figure 4: Overview of our approach.
our optimizations for using extreme traffic matrices and canonicaliz-
ing failure patterns are effective: the latter can reduce computational
complexity by 3-5 orders of magnitude.
Putting It All Together. Our contributions collectively result in
the processing pipeline shown in Figure 4. The input to the first
stage of the pipeline is a trunk description used to determine a
minimal-upflow wiring. The next stage in the pipeline takes this
wiring, together with a failure pattern, and produces the effective
capacity of the WAN router under that failure pattern. This effective
capacity is then used to optimize compact routing tables.
Implications. As cloud and content providers simultaneously
strive to achieve high utilization, high availability, and low cost,
they need tools that enable them to make these tradeoffs in a
principled way. In the WAN setting, our work shows that it is
possible to mask significant failures (i.e., tolerate failures without
losing capacity). Using our approach, they may also be able to
reduce cost by reducing the number of L2 switches and internal
links (in today’s WAN routers, internal links use expensive optics).
Ethics. This work does not raise any ethical issues.
2 MINIMAL-UPFLOW TRUNK WIRING
In this section, we explore the first challenge: how to find the
minimal-upflow wiring for a set of trunks in a WAN router.
