## In 4.1.1, non-sharding-table SQL do not supported nested subquery,
I'm sorry for the bad reading experience. I translated the English with Google
and made some adjustments.
this nested subquery has nothing to do with the table I want to sharing.  
For example, if the table to be sharding is "log" ,  
and a SQL String not contain "log",  
like  
select  
*  
from (select  
...  
from  
(select  
*  
from user  
union  
select  
*  
from account  
)t left join........  
) temp where......  
when I run the SQL , I will get the error message "Can not find owner from
table",  
related code: ProjectionsContextEngine.find(), line 197, throw new
IllegalStateException("Can not find owner from table.")
This SQL does not contain the table to be sharding. Why is it parsed?  
Similar to "SQLString.contains("log")?doSharding():doDefault()",  
Does it have such a function? I didn't find it.  
I think the SQL that are not sharding do not need to be processed by sharding-
jdbc.
