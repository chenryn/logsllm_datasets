User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to increase anonymity of Tor I need some system to gain a high level anonymity - nobody should have the possibility to figure out my IP.
I can use Tor, but I do not completely trust to it.
So I have an idea for a system with high level anonymity:

My computer — VPS1 — Tor — VPS2 — Internet

I can register two Ubuntu servers - VPS1 and VPS2 (assume I do not expose my IP while registering the servers, servers and hosting service do not create logs).
Then I set up a VPN between my computer and VPS1.
Also I set up a VPN between VPS1 and VPS2 - this network works over Tor.

If I need to perform any actions that require anonymity - I connect to VPN (to VPS1). My traffic goes to VPS1, then to VPS2 through Tor, then to needed internet service. After the actions performed - I disconnect from VPN.

Does this system make sense?
Do you have any suggestions how to improve this?
What software best fits my needs?
What are the main risks when setting up such a system?

Assistant: This actually decreases anonymity. If the final IP address you exit from is fixed, for example a VPN, then you lose a large amount of privacy and anonymity functionality that Tor provides via its rotating exit relays. The fixed exit IP would result in a persistent exit point. Additionally, you would be exposing your networking stack to TCP fingerprinting, rather than exposing that of the exit relay. VPNs are vulnerable to this kind of fingerprinting because they send networking packets assembled by your operating system to the destination server unchanged, revealing identifying information.
If you wish to avoid membership attribution (revealing the mere fact that you are using Tor), a VPN does not help. Tor sends traffic in bursts of 514 bytes called cells. Anyone who sees a VPN connection that is sending encrypted data in 514 byte bursts can infer that Tor is being used. If you want to hide the fact that you are using Tor, you could use pluggable transports which obfuscate the traffic between you and a bridge relay, making detection and blocking harder.
Tor is designed to be most effective when used on its own. It provides rotating exits to reduce inter-website fingerprinting. It provides persistent guards to mitigate sybil attacks. It allows the use of bridges to bypass censorship. Even ignoring the fact the VPNs in general are bad at resisting traffic analysis attacks, chaining it with any other networks can interfere with these security features.
