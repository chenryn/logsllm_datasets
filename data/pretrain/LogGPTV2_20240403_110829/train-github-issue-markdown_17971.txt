To reproduce:
https://github.com/PlasmaSheep/flask-bug
Clone repo and install flask (python2)
    export FLASK_APP=/path/to/repo/flask-bug/autoapp.py 
    flask run
Notice the output:
    [$]>>> flask run
    Using config: development
    Debug is: True
     * Serving Flask app "autoapp"
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
So debug is enabled in the config, but the debugger is not actually active.
This does work if you set the `FLASK_DEBUG` env variable:
    [$]>>>  flask run
     * Serving Flask app "autoapp"
     * Forcing debug mode on
    Using config: development
    Debug is: True
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
     * Restarting with stat
    Using config: development
    Debug is: True
     * Debugger is active!
     * Debugger pin code: 155-859-497
However I think that the debug parameter should be specified in only one
place, and that place should be the application config file so that you don't
have to worry about setting environment variables for things you already
specified in the config.
