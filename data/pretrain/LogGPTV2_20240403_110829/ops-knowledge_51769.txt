Question: "Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol?"
 "A": "The public parameters p and g do not need to be chosen for each key exchange as they are often hardcoded or defined in a standard."
 "B": "Alice and Bob use their private values to compute a shared secret key that cannot be efficiently deduced by an eavesdropper."
 "C": "The shared secret key generated through the Diffie-Hellman key exchange is directly used for a symmetric-key cryptosystem without any further processing."
 "D": "The fastest known algorithms for an eavesdropper to solve the Diffie-Hellman problem take exponential time in the number of bits of the prime p."
Answer: C
