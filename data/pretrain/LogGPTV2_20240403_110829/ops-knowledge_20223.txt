User: How to prevent and solve network security attacks as much as possible, such as DDoS, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.?
Assistant: The methods to prevent network security attacks are as follows: 1. Install anti-virus software and firewall, and update them in time to keep the software version updated to the latest. 2. Do not download and install software from unknown sources at will, and do not visit suspicious links and websites. 3. Implement password policies, mandate password complexity, and change passwords regularly. 4. Enable network access control and authority management, restrict users who can access information, and not expose sensitive information. 5. Encrypted data transmission, especially the transmission of sensitive data, such as bank passwords, credit card numbers, etc. 6. Regularly back up important data, and there must be complete and reliable backup data to avoid data loss caused by hacker attacks. For different types of attacks, the following measures can be taken: 1. DDoS attack: Deploy network traffic analyzers to detect threats and intercept attack traffic, import protection software to limit IP addresses, purchase DDoS protection services on demand, perform capacity planning and Question survey, etc. 2. SQL injection: Use precompiled queries, stored procedures, and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks. Related defense measures are also provided in the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 standard. 3. Cross-site scripting: Use appropriate encoding and filtering techniques to protect websites, and enable Content Security Policy to limit the execution of malicious scripts. You can also use cross-site scripting defense software to filter scripts and set HTTP-only cookies to provide protection against cross-site scripting attacks.
