User: I am using scons to build on windows. My SConscript file takes certain command line options to build like OS=win7 CPU=x86_64 etc. Every time I run scons from command line I have to type these options, Is there a way I can put them in SConscript file or set an environment variable so that I don't have to type them every time I build.
I tried setting SCONSFLAGS but it didn't seem to work.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: I made it to work bu just setting an environment variable on Windows, TEST ="OS=win7 CPU=x86_64" and then running the scons script as scons %TEST%
