### Title: BlackHat EU-21: APTs Go Teleworking - The Rise of VPN Exploits

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote work has become more prevalent, leading to an increased reliance on Virtual Private Network (VPN) technologies for secure access to private networks. Pulse Secure, a product by Ivanti, is one of the leading VPN solutions. These enterprise-grade devices are typically deployed at the boundary between trusted and untrusted networks, and they often integrate multi-factor authentication and Active Directory for enhanced security.

In April 2021, Mandiant reported on the misuse of Pulse Secure VPN devices, including their exploitation by suspected Chinese-nexus threat actors for cyber espionage. Mandiant observed the use of a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893) to compromise fully patched Pulse Secure appliances, as well as the re-use of previously disclosed vulnerabilities. The attackers achieved the following:

1. **Deployment of Malware**: They deployed 16 unique malware families specifically designed to operate on Pulse Secure VPN appliances. This included various webshells and modifications to weaken cryptographic libraries.
2. **Bypassing Security Measures**: The attackers bypassed multi-factor authentication and performed credential theft.
3. **Anti-Forensics**: They engaged in anti-forensic activities, including the removal of log files from the compromised VPN devices. After Mandiant's public disclosure in April 2021, the attackers altered the backdoors they had deployed.
4. **Lateral Movement and Access**: The attackers moved laterally into private networks, accessed Microsoft 365 public cloud environments, and targeted virtual environments using stolen credentials.

As an incident responder, this talk will focus on the investigative aspects of these VPN device compromises, addressing the following points:

1. **Challenges in Detection**: We will discuss the challenges associated with detecting and responding to VPN device compromises, and why these attacks often go undetected.
2. **Campaign Overview**: We will provide an overview of the campaign, the malware used, and the threat actor identified, from a European perspective.
3. **Best Practices**: We will share best practices for digital forensics and incident response, based on Mandiant's investigations of these intrusions.
4. **Securing Gatekeepers**: Given that organizations continue to rely on VPN technology, we will explore strategies to enhance the security of these critical gatekeepers.

By understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by these threat actors, organizations can better protect their networks and respond effectively to such incidents.
