The provided CodePen example is not functioning as expected. It appears that the OpenWeatherMap API now requires an API key for access. You can obtain an API key by visiting their official website: [OpenWeatherMap API](http://www.openweathermap.org/api).

Additionally, the JavaScript console displays the following error message:
```
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=48.1270&lon=11.3665&units=metric&callback=jQuery2130876683295937255_1444809427340&_=1444809427342
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)
```

This error indicates that the request to the OpenWeatherMap API was unauthorized, likely due to the absence of a valid API key. To resolve this issue, you will need to include your API key in the request URL.
