Here's my problem.
Using react-router 1.0, i'm going to be re-rendering trees that are 90% the
same. We use an external lib for an api that produces video mark up. Totally
out of our hands. They modify the dom and that's how it has to be.
My problem comes in that when the routing changes, it re-renders the tree, and
wipes out the custom DOM put in by the third party api.
I've tried things like returning false from `shouldComponentUpdate` always..
using `dangerouslySetInnerHtml={{__html: ''}}` to a blank string hoping that
react would internally not do diff's on it.. nothing seems to work.
Is there anything I can do to stop it?
