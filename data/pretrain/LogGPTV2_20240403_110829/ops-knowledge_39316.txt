User: Using Python 2.7 installed via homebrew. I then used pip to install IPython. So, IPython seems to be installed under: 
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ 
I think this is true because there is a IPython directory and ipython egg. 
However, when I type ipython in the terminal I get: 
-bash: ipython: command not found
I do not understand why this ONLY happens with IPython and not with python? Also, how do I fix this? What path should I add in .bashrc? And how should I add? 
Currently, my .bashrc reads: 
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/
Thanks!
Assistant: For me the only thing that helped was:
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
Upgrading pip did the work and all the installations started working properly!
Give it a try.
