User: OS: ubuntu 16.04LTS
Python: 2.7.12 + Anaconda2-4.2.0 (64 bit)
I typed pip install --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL to install tensorflow but terminal showed that my pip verson was 8.1.1, however version 9.0.1 is available. 
Then I typed pip install --upgrade pip to upgrade but it showed 
Requirement already up-to-date: pip in ./anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages, 
I still can't use pip version 9.0.1 to install tensorflow. Does anyone know what's going on ??
Assistant: sudo -H pip install --upgrade pip
sudo is "super user do". This will allow you to execute commands as a super user. The H flag tells sudo to keep the home directory of the current user. This way when pip installs things, like pip itself, it uses the appropriate directory.
