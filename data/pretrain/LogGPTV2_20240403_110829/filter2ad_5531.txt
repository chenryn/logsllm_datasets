ABSTRACT
As more and more cyber security incident data ranging from sys-
tems logs to vulnerability scan results are collected, manually ana-
lyzing these collected data to detect important cyber security events
become impossible. Hence, data mining techniques are becoming
an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For ex-
ample, a report from Gartner [4] claims that “Information security
is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts
of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful pat-
terns”. Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where
the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prior-
itized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the
question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber secu-
rity applications?
One of the most important differences between data mining for
cyber security and many other data mining applications is the ex-
istence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their be-
havior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models
ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are
insufﬁcient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The ad-
versaries adapt to the data miner’s reactions, and data mining algo-
rithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To
address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel
data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial
behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining
community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this re-
search direction would be beneﬁcial for cyber security researchers
who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining
techniques in practice.
To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data
mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foun-
dations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data
mining to cyber security applications. We ﬁrst introduce various
approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adver-
saries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error
through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic frame-
work to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data
miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also in-

1. OVERVIEW
Due to existence of malicious attackers that try to evade detec-
tion, data analytics techniques for cyber security need to be resilient
against the changing behaviors of the adversaries, and are able to
quickly detect previously unknown new attack instances. To de-
velop resilient data analytics techniques, recently, various adver-
sarial data mining techniques (including our own prior research)
are being developed to counter adversarial behaviors.
This tutorial is intended for an audience who are interested in
applying data mining techniques to cyber security challenges. Ba-
sic prior knowledge about statistics and basic data mining knowl-
edge, such as standard supervised learning and unsupervised learn-
ing techniques, would be useful.
The three hour long tutorial is divided into three parts. In the
ﬁrst 45 minutes, we introduce the foundations of adversarial data
mining. The second part (approximately 45 minutes) is devoted
to the novel techniques used in adversarial data mining. The third
part (approximately 90 minutes) is focused on the application ar-
eas and practical tools. Below are the detailed descriptions of the
foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data
mining that is discussed during the tutorial.
1.1 Foundations of Adversarial Data Mining
One intuitive approach to ﬁght the adversary is to let the classiﬁer
adapt to the adversary’s actions, either manually or automatically.
Such a classiﬁer was proposed in [2]. They deﬁne the problem as
a game between two cost-sensitive opponents: a naive Bayes clas-
siﬁer and an adversary playing optimal strategies. Their adversary-
aware algorithm made predictions according to the class that max-
imizes the conditional utility. The problem is that this becomes a
never-ending game between the classiﬁer and the adversary.
Furthermore, in online learning such as [1], a strategic game has
been used to learn a concept in real time or make a prediction for
the near future by seeing instances one at a time. As the ﬁrst part of
our tutorial, we brieﬂy discuss these various theoretical foundations
and their implications for cyber security tasks.

In the second part of this tutorial, we discuss in detail different
approaches developed for adversarial data mining. We discuss the
two-player game model of the problem [3], where the adversary
tries to maximize its return and the data miner tries to minimize
the misclassiﬁcation cost. We examine the classiﬁer performance
and the adversary’s behavior at such an equilibrium point. In an
adversarial environment where the underlying populations are con-
stantly being transformed, the classiﬁer’s initial success has little
impact on its long term performance, even if the classiﬁer is con-
stantly adjusted to ﬁght the new threats. A classiﬁer’s performance
at the equilibrium is a more accurate measure for its eventual effec-
tiveness. We then discuss the implications of these results on how
to choose a set of effective features for adversarial data mining ap-
plications.
We then discuss various attack models against data mining tech-
niques: a free-range attack model that permits arbitrary data cor-
ruption and a restrained attack model that anticipates more realis-
tic attacks that a reasonable adversary would devise under penal-
ties. We introduce optimal support vector machine (SVM) [9, 8]
learning strategies against the two attack models. We also discuss
other resilient learning techniques developed to counter adversarial
adaptation and behavior.
1.3 Cyber Security Applications
We discuss intrusion detection and mobile malware detection as
two important application areas for adversarial data mining. Espe-
cially, we discuss how some of these data mining techniques could
be implemented on recent big data management systems such as
Spark.
Intrusion Detection: Detecting the presence of information ﬂows
and ﬂow changes is a fundamental problem in complex and multi-
scale data networks with important applications in different aspects
of network design.
In network security and intrusion detection,
for example, adversaries can hide their identity by launching the
so-called stepping-stone attack where compromised hosts are used
as stepping stones to relay attacking commands. For the network
defender, the problem is to detect stepping-stone connections—a
ﬂow of information—and trace such connections to the attacker. In
other forms of intrusion, the attacker may hijack the normal traf-
ﬁc and create a hidden pathway. The problem here is to detect the
presence of irregular trafﬁc ﬂow or the change of ﬂow dynamics
from the normal trafﬁc ﬂows. Adversarial data mining techniques
provide an alternative approach for intrusion detection. In this part,
we discuss how adversarial data mining theory and tools could be
applied to intrusion detection. In addition, we survey the previous
data mining approaches used for intrusion detection (e.g., [7]) and
how they could be updated in the light of recent adversarial data
mining developments.
Mobile Malware Detection: As smart phone software become
more complex, more malware programs are created to exploit spe-
ciﬁc weaknesses in smart phone software. Smart phones end users
all together constitute a large portion of the powerful mobile net-
work. Having access to the enormous amount of personal informa-
tion on this network is a great incentive for adversaries to attack the
smart phone mobile world.
Malicious activities on mobile phones are often carried out through
lightweight applications, scrupulously avoiding detection while leav-
ing little trace for malware analysis. Over the years many malware
detection techniques have been proposed. These techniques can be
roughly divided into two groups: static analysis and dynamic anal-
ysis. Static analysis techniques (e.g., [5]) discover implications of
unusual program activities directly from the source code. Although
static analysis is a critical component in program analysis, its abil-
ity to cope with highly dynamic malware is usually unsatisfactory.
Dynamic analysis (also known as behavioral analysis) (e.g., [6])
identiﬁes security holes by executing a program and closely moni-
toring its activities. Information such as system calls, network ac-
cess, and ﬁles and memory modiﬁcations is collected from the op-
erating system at run-time. Since the actual behavior of a program
is monitored, threats from dynamic tactics such as obfuscation are
not as severe in dynamic analysis. However, dynamic analysis can
not guarantee a malicious payload is always activated every time
the host program is executed. Meanwhile some dynamic analysis
techniques leverage data mining techniques.
We discuss the weaknesses of traditional data mining techniques
against mobile malware that randomizes its action. For example,
data mining based malware detection technique could easily de-
grade in performance, if a malware that captures private phone calls
randomizes the amount of data transferred. Adversarial data min-
ing models with carefully chosen utility functions of the malware
developers offer a more effective approach. We discuss how those
approaches could be applied for mobile malware detection.
