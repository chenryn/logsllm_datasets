**Description:**
This command adds a driver group to the server. A driver group is a collection of driver packages that can be managed and deployed together.

**Syntax:**
```shell
wdsutil /add-DriverGroup /DriverGroup:<GroupName> 
        [/Server:<ServerName>] 
        [/Enabled:{Yes | No}] 
        [/Applicability:{Matched | All}] 
        [/Filtertype:<FilterType> /Policy:{Include | Exclude} /Value:<Value> [/Value:<Value> ...]]
```

**Parameters:**

- **/DriverGroup:** Specifies the name of the new driver group.
- **/Server:** Specifies the name of the server. This can be the NetBIOS name or the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). If no server name is specified, the local server is used.
- **/Enabled:{Yes|No}:** Enables or disables the driver group.
- **/Applicability:{Matched|All}:** Determines which driver packages to install if the filter criteria are met. 
  - `Matched:` Install only the driver packages that match the client's hardware.
  - `All:` Install all the packages to clients, regardless of their hardware.
- **/Filtertype:** Specifies the type of filter to add to the group. You can specify multiple filter types in a single command. Each filter type must be followed by `/Policy` and at least one `/Value`. Valid values include:
  - `BiosVendor`
  - `BiosVersion`
  - `ChassisType`
  - `Manufacturer`
  - `Uuid`
  - `OsVersion`
  - `OsEdition`
  - `OsLanguage`
  - For more information about acceptable filter type values, see [Driver Group Filters](#driver-group-filters).
- **/Policy:{Include|Exclude}:** Specifies the policy to be set on the filter.
  - `Include:` Client computers that match the filter are allowed to install the drivers in this group.
  - `Exclude:` Client computers that match the filter are not allowed to install the drivers in this group.
- **/Value:** Specifies the client value that corresponds to the `/Filtertype`. You can specify multiple values for a single filter type.

**Examples:**

1. To add a driver group with the name `printerdrivers` and enable it:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /add-DriverGroup /DriverGroup:printerdrivers /Enabled:Yes
   ```

2. To add a driver group with the name `printerdrivers`, set the applicability to `All`, and apply filters based on the manufacturer and chassis type:
   ```shell
   wdsutil /add-DriverGroup /DriverGroup:printerdrivers /Applicability:All 
           /Filtertype:Manufacturer /Policy:Include /Value:Name1 
           /Filtertype:ChassisType /Policy:Exclude /Value:Tower /Value:MiniTower
   ```
