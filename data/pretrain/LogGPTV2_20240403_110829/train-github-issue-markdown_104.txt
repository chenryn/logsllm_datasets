## Expected Behavior
Client side routing, navigation and routing would work.
## Current Behavior
Ran `next export` and when I serve locally (and online) there's a client side
JavaScript error that breaks all the client side logic.
Without sourcemaps (or any other debugging tools?) I can't work out what's
happening. Live URL: https://dkfyjniin9u60.cloudfront.net/ (see console in
browser).
Not sure I can replicate as yet, as it's larger site - pretty sure the vanilla
examples work.
## Context
Including the `next.config.js` \- possibly this is factoring?
    const { env } = process;
    const webpack = require('webpack');
    module.exports = {
      exportPathMap () {
        // we fetch our list of posts, this allow us to dynamically generate the exported pages
        const all = require('./server/lib/docs');
        // transform the list of posts into a map of pages with the pathname `/post/:id`
        const pages = all.posts.docs.reduce((pages, post) =>
          Object.assign({}, pages, {
            [`${post.url}`]: {
              page: '/_post',
              query: { slug: post.slug }
            }
          }),
        {});
        // combine the map of post pages with the home
        return Object.assign({}, pages, {
          '/': { page: '/' }
        });
      },
      webpack: function (config) {
        // this exposes everything on process.env.X
        const webpackEnv = Object.keys(env).reduce((acc, curr) => {
          acc[`process.env.${curr}`] = JSON.stringify(env[curr]);
          return acc;
        }, {});
        config.plugins.push(new webpack.DefinePlugin(webpackEnv));
        return config;
      }
    };
