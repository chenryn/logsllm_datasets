### Title: Black Hat EU-21: Greetings from the '90s: Exploiting the Design of Industrial Controllers in Modern Settings

In recent years, there has been a significant increase in research focused on the security of embedded systems used in industrial process control, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) and Remote Terminal Units (RTUs). This heightened interest is driven by both the abundance of "low-hanging fruit" vulnerabilities that make these systems attractive targets for researchers, and the growing interest from adversaries in subverting industrial processes.

To date, most research efforts have concentrated on firmware vulnerabilities or bypassing traditional security controls implemented in PLC software. In this presentation, we will introduce a novel exploitation vector that has not been previously considered in existing literature. Specifically, we will demonstrate how PLC programming practices, user APIs, and memory allocation for function blocks from the Library Functions can be exploited to automate the enumeration of PLC control logic, identify key infrastructure configuration parameters and process control variables, and subsequently manipulate them to achieve a desired attack impact.

Furthermore, we will show how allocated but unused memory can be leveraged to establish covert Command and Control (C2) channels. These channels enable attackers to run standard security tools, exfiltrate data, and execute high-precision cyber-physical attacks on previously inaccessible network segments.

To ensure our threat scenario is both realistic and engaging, we will present it within the context of a typical industrial network architecture, incorporating recommended security measures such as network monitoring and segregation from the Internet via firewalls. The proposed set of exploitation techniques is designed to be stealthy, allowing for the development of fully automated, high-precision physical damage payloads, thereby significantly enhancing the capabilities of potential attackers.

The primary objective of this talk is to initiate a discussion around the need for guidance and best practices to support DevSecOps for industrial equipment. These practices should take into account the engineering designs of the equipment and the specific requirements of their use in cyber-physical applications. Current PLC software designs and programming practices remain largely under-researched. Through this presentation, we aim to highlight an unexplored attack surface and a new class of vulnerabilities, and invite the security community to further investigate this critical area.

By addressing these issues, we hope to contribute to the development of more secure and resilient industrial control systems.
