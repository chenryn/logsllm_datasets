## RELI {#c02.xhtml#head-2-15}
I call this tool RELI because when you type these four letters in the
Windows search box on the taskbar, there is usually nothing else to
choose from besides this one, the Reliability History/Monitor. RELI
traces its roots all the way back to Windows Vista. It allows you to see
the stability of a machine in a timeline. When you start typing it in
the Start menu, you\'ll notice the name of the tool displays as
Reliability History. Once you open the tool, it renames itself to
Reliability Monitor. (Thank you, Microsoft.)
Reliability Monitor will build a graph for you of important events,
application and Windows failures, and updates and other information that
might be important. [Figure
2.1](#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0001){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0001} shows the graph
that gets generated from application, Windows, and miscellaneous
failures. In [Lab
2.1](#c02.xhtml#c02-fea-0001){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fea-0001}, you\'ll use
RELI.

## USING RELI {#c02.xhtml#head-2-17}
::: section
[]{#c02.xhtml#c02-sec-0004}
Let\'s say you are a system administrator. Most system administrators
install, upgrade, and monitor software and hardware for their
organizations. You have a server in your datacenter that is periodically
misbehaving. You attempt to troubleshoot the issue and cannot duplicate
the problem that was reported to you. Instead, you get the infamous
BSOD.
You will learn that the first thing you ask customers when they report a
problem is, "Have you tried turning it off and on again?" If you do
unfortunately experience a BSOD, then your only option is to power down
and turn the device back on. Check `reli` to determine what caused that
crash.
It has been my experience that a BSOD is caused by bad drivers,
overheating, or someone installing new software that is incompatible
with either the hardware or the operating system. Using `reli` is how
you figure out what really happened.

## PSR {#c02.xhtml#head-2-18}
Are you the one in your organization who is responsible for continuance
or documentation? Do you have to train others how to do their job, or
have you been asked to train someone to do yours? Do you ever have to
troubleshoot an environmental problem on a system or give a presentation
at the last minute?
[]{#c02.xhtml#Page_20 .pagebreak title="20" role="doc-pagebreak"}Problem
Steps Recorder (PSR) goes back to Windows 7 and Server 2008. PSR is a
combination troubleshooting, assistance, screen capture, annotation tool
that few IT professionals know about. You can use it to document your
steps quickly with annotated screenshots and instructions. You can use
it to troubleshoot an issue for a customer who is not as IT‐savvy as
you. My favorite way to use it is to build documentation.
One of the best questions you can as your IT manager is, "What keeps you
up at night?" When I am teaching, I try to learn as much as I can about
my students\' needs and goals. One of the biggest responses to the
question about their security challenges is lack of documentation and
continuance. This tool will help solve that problem.
In my experience, I have managed people new to IT who often ask the same
questions over and over again. To empower them to find the answers, I
created PSRs for repetitive questions like the following and store them
on an easily searchable SharePoint site:
-   ["How do I add a static IP?"]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0009}
-   ["How do I configure a network printer?"]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0010}
-   ["How do I add a user in Active Directory?"]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0011}
In [Lab 2.2](#c02.xhtml#c02-fea-0003){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fea-0003},
you\'ll use PSR.

To review the Problem Steps Recorder file you just created, in the
upper‐left corner of the recording, you could click the New Recording
button if this did not capture exactly the process you were looking for.
If it is a file that you will want to use, click the Save button. When
you save this file, it is saved in a `.zip`[]{#c02.xhtml#Page_21
.pagebreak title="21" role="doc-pagebreak"}file by default. If
customers/employees are having an IT issue, they can easily email you
this file with all the contents for you to examine the issue. When you
open the `.zip` file, you\'ll notice the file type is MHTML. You can
right‐click and open this file type with Word and edit it until it reads
exactly as you want it to for your continuance or documentation.
Each step recorded has a date and time and is annotated in bright green
in the screenshot surrounding what you clicked. Examine your
screenshots. In the first frame, your Start button will be highlighted
in green with an arrow on it. The explanation at the top of each picture
will tell you how the data was entered. When you\'re troubleshooting,
sometimes input makes a difference.
At the bottom of the Recorded Steps page, there will be an Additional
Details section. This section contains specific details about software
and operating systems that only programmers or advanced IT people will
understand. Review this to make sure nothing is in here that you don\'t
want shared.
Have you ever been asked to present in a meeting with 15 minutes prep
time? I\'m good, but I\'m not that good. If you are being asked to
present on something that you can show in PSR, scroll up to the top of
the page and click the hyperlink "Review the recorded steps as a slide
show."
There are a few caveats to PSR. It will look much more professional if
you record on just one monitor. This tool will not record text that you
type such as passwords; it will record only function and shortcut keys.
It also will not capture streaming video or a full‐screen game. You may
get a static picture, but this tool delivers a flat, one‐dimensional
file. You are also limited by default to only 25 screenshots. If you
need more than 25, you will have to go to the Help menu and adjust the
settings. These settings will be temporary and not retained. They go
back to the default when you close and reopen the program.
I have had professional IT students tell me this tool alone was worth
the price of admission to class.

## PathPing {#c02.xhtml#head-2-20}
In 2017, Panasonic developed a prototype that not only washes and dries
but also folds your clothes. There are some technologies that just
belong together.
PathPing is the washer/dryer/folder combination of Windows. If you take
a ping and squish it together with a tracert, you have PathPing. Each
node is pinged as the result of a single command. Details of the path
between two hosts and the echo‐location statistics for each node are
displayed. The behavior of nodes is studied over an extended time
period---25 seconds each, to be exact. This is in comparison to the
default ping sample of four messages or default tracert single‐route
trace.
PathPing will first do a tracert to the destination. Second, it uses
ICMP to ping each hop 100 times. This is used to verify latency between
the source host []{#c02.xhtml#Page_22 .pagebreak title="22"
role="doc-pagebreak"}and the destination. You cannot completely rely on
ICMP when public devices are involved. They are public devices.
Occasionally on the Internet, you will run into situations where an ICMP
ping destined for one host has 50 percent failure and the next hop has
100 percent success.
[Figure 2.3](#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0003){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0003} shows
the tracing route to Google\'s public DNS server 8.8.8.8. From my
desktop to the server, it takes 11 hops. Then PathPing will compute the
statistics of round‐trip time (RTT) as well as the percentage of how
many packets were dropped between the two IP addresses. When you see
loss rates, it might indicate that these routers are overloaded.
![[**[Figure 2.3](#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0003){#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0003
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} PathPing combining both
traceroute and statistics of each hop](Images/c02f003.jpg){.center
width="751" height="662"}
PathPing is a better diagnostic tool to use if latency in your network
is a concern. The interpretation of the data from a PathPing will give
you a more robust hypothesis. If you see anomalies or peaks and valleys
in the data on hop 6, it doesn\'t necessarily mean that hop 6 is the
problem. It could be that hop 6 just happens to be under immense
pressure or the processor has priorities other than your PathPing at the
moment. A tool that ISPs use to prevent []{#c02.xhtml#Page_23 .pagebreak
title="23" role="doc-pagebreak"}overwhelming floods of ICMP is called
*control‐plane policing* (CoPP). This type of flood prevention can also
alter the results you see from PathPing. In [Lab
2.3](#c02.xhtml#c02-fea-0004){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fea-0004}, you\'ll use
PathPing.
