Subject: Issue with Google App Engine Task Queue (Push) After Deployment

Dear Support Team,

I am currently working with the Google App Engine Tasks Queue feature (Push). During local testing with the development server, everything operates smoothly. However, after deploying my application, the tasks fail to execute as expected.

To diagnose the issue, I have implemented logging using the Python `logging` module. Unfortunately, these logs are not appearing in the dashboard, which is preventing me from identifying the root cause of the problem.

Could you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue? Specifically, I would like to know if there are any additional configurations or settings required for the task queue to function correctly in a deployed environment.

Additionally, could you clarify whether the application is running on the `appspot.com` domain or a custom domain? I understand that there may be known issues with custom domains in this scenario. If necessary, I will file a bug report.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
