Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

**Original Log Line:**
```
Closed socket connection for client /10.10.34.13:54265 (no session established for client)
```

**Extracted Template:**
```
Closed socket connection for client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT> (no session established for client)
```

In this template:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>` represents the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.13`).
- `<PORT>` represents the port number (e.g., `54265`).

This format makes it clear what each part of the log line represents, enhancing readability and maintainability.
