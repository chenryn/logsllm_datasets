Please go to Stack Overflow for help and support:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tensorflow
If you open a GitHub issue, here is our policy:
  1. It must be a bug, a feature request, or a significant problem with documentation (for small docs fixes please send a PR instead).
  2. The form below must be filled out.
  3. It shouldn't be a TensorBoard issue. Those go here.
**Here's why we have that policy** : TensorFlow developers respond to issues.
We want to focus on work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs
and adding features. Support only helps individuals. GitHub also notifies
thousands of people when issues are filed. We want them to see you
communicating an interesting problem, rather than being redirected to Stack
Overflow.

### System information
  * **Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow)** : No
  * **OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04)** : Ubuntu 16.04
  * **TensorFlow installed from (source or binary)** : pip install tensorflow-nightly-gpu
  * **TensorFlow version (use command below)** : 1.10
  * **Python version** : 2.7
  * **Bazel version (if compiling from source)** :
  * **GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source)** :
  * **CUDA/cuDNN version** :
  * **GPU model and memory** :
  * **Exact command to reproduce** :  
import tensorflow as tf  
You can collect some of this information using our environment capture script:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh
You can obtain the TensorFlow version with
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"
### Describe the problem
Describe the problem clearly here. Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in
TensorFlow or a feature request.
### Source code / logs
Include any logs or source code that would be helpful to diagnose the problem.
If including tracebacks, please include the full traceback. Large logs and
files should be attached. Try to provide a reproducible test case that is the
bare minimum necessary to generate the problem.
