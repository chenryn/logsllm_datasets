User: I'm trying to do some local processing of data entries from the GAE datastore and I am trying to do this by using the remote_api. I just want to write some quick processing scripts that pull some data, but I am getting import errors saying that Python cannot import from google.
Am I supposed to run the script from within the development environment somehow. Or perhaps I need to include all of the google stuff in my Python path? That seems excessive though.
Assistant: Why is including the paths that onerous ?
Normally the remote_api shell is used interactively but it is a good tool that you can use as the basis of acheiving what your want.
The simplest way will be to copy and modify the remote_api shell  so that rather than presenting an interactive shell you get it to run a named script.
That way it will deal with all the path setup.
In the past I have integrated the remote_api inside a zope server, so that plone could publish stuff to appengine.  All sort of things are possible with remote_api, however you need to deal with imports like anything else in python, except that appengine libraries are not installed in site-packages.
