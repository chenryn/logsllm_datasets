A SIMULATED PATHS REFLECT ACTUAL
PATHS
Our methods for quantifying reachability and reliance use simu-
lated prefix announcements based on a generated AS-level topology
graph. The topology graph was modeled from the CAIDA AS rela-
tionship dataset [15], which we augmented with additional neigh-
bors based on traceroute measurements from VMs hosted in each
of the cloud providers (§4.1). Since we are simulating the AS-level
topology and networks’ routing policies, we want to verify that our
simulated paths reflect actual paths taken by traffic.
We compared all the paths tied for best, plus alternate paths, cal-
culated by our model against the paths taken by our traceroute data
sourced from inside each cloud provider’s network while remov-
ing invalid traceroutes (§4.1). We also did not consider traceroutes
that did not reach the destination AS. Overall, our simulated paths
contained the true path for 73.3% of the traceroutes from Amazon,
91.9% from Google, 82.9% from IBM, and 85.4% from Microsoft. We
hypothesize that the reason for Amazon’s lower percentage is due
to the fact that they do not allow tenant traffic to traverse their
backbone by default, so there is more variation in the actual paths
taken from Amazon because hosted VMs are not allowed to use
directly connected neighbors at a distant PoP.
B CASE STUDY: EXAMINING TIER-1
RELIANCE ON TIER-2 NETWORKS
In §6.4, we saw that the cloud providers have low reliance on any
individual network, which is also reflected by their high hierarchy-
free reachability. Most Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs have high hierarchy-
free reachability, however, there were a small number of Tier-1 ISPs
that had a sizeable reduction in hierarchy-free reachability when
bypassing the Tier-2 ISPs in addition to the other Tier-1 ISPs. The
Tier-1 ISPs are supposed to be the backbone of the Internet, so we
want to examine the reliance of the hierarchy-free reachability out-
liers to understand why their reachability decreases so significantly,
and to compare the differences in their peering strategies versus
the cloud providers and other Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
Sprint (AS 1239) saw the greatest decrease, and Deutsche
Telekom (AS 3320) saw the second greatest decrease. Sprint
declined from 55,385 when bypassing the Tier-1 ISPs to 32,568
when also bypassing the Tier-2 ISPs, while Deutsche Telekom
declined from 55,990 when bypassing the Tier-1 ISPs to 33,307
when also bypassing the Tier-2 ISPs. To determine why they
see such a decline in reachability, we calculated the reachability
reliance for each to determine which of the Tier-2 ISPs had the
greatest effect on Sprint and Deutsche Telekom’s reachability.
To calculate reliance, we map the reliance based on Sprint and
Deutsche Telekom’s reachability results using Tier-1-free reachabil-
ity (bypassing the other Tier-1 ISPs, §6.3). Under closer examination,
without the other Tier-1 ISPs Sprint relies primarily on Hurricane
Electric, PCCW, Comcast, Liberty Global, Vodafone, and Telstra.
Bypassing only these six Tier-2 ISPs reduces Sprint’s reachability to
35,199, which covers almost the entire decrease in their reachability.
Deutsche Telekom has a strong reliance on several Tier-2 ISPs,
primarily: Hurricane Electric, PCCW, Comcast, Liberty Global,
Vodafone, and RETN. Bypassing these six Tier-2 ISPs reduces

Table 3: Percentage of PoP locations for each network that were
confirmed using rDNS. Some networks actively maintain rDNS and
PeeringDB records and have high confirmation percentages. Over-
all, we were able to confirm 73% of the PoPs we identified creating
our topology graphs using rDNS, which shows a lack of information
available in rDNS.
Deutsche Telekom’s reachability to 35,743, which covers almost
the entire decrease in their reachability.
This highlights the starkly different strategies for some of the
Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs. Sprint and Deutsche Telekom, for example,
rely heavily on the hierarchical topology to establish interconnec-
tivity and for reachability, while others (e.g., Level 3) have diver-
sified their connectivity and reduced their reliance on individual
networks. It also shows that Sprint and Deutsche Telekom’s re-
liance are closer to the purely hierarchical structure than the cloud
providers and other Tier-1 and Tier-2 ISPs.
C POP AND RDNS ENTRIES
We combined available topology maps, PeeringDB, and rDNS data
to construct a PoP level map of the cloud providers, Tier-1 ISPs,
and Tier-2 ISPs. The number of PoPs and the percentage visible in
rDNS can be seen in Table 3.
D GEOLOCATION PROCESS
Since geolocation databases are known to be inaccurate, especially
for routers [38], we geolocated traceroute IP addresses with an
approach similar to the active geolocation technique from RIPE
IPmap [86] and identical to prior work [8]:
(1) We derive candidate locations for IP address X, by deter-
mining its ASN ASNX, and finding the set of ⟨facility, city⟩
locations listed for ASNX in PeeringDB [81]. If there are lo-
cation hints in rDNS, we only use candidates locations that
match it.
2Private conversation with a Microsoft operator regarding the low rDNS coverage.
The operator confirmed that the lack of rDNS coverage data was not due to incorrect
maps, but due to the lack of rDNS entries.
Cloud Provider Connectivity in the Flat Internet
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Comparing the green and blue bars, the amount of direct con-
nectivity varies across cloud providers, but each individual cloud
provider’s direct connectivity as a percentage of all ASes is relatively
similar over time, despite their increased interconnectivity (§6.5).
Google’s percentage of direct paths actually went down, but this is
not due to decreased interconnectivity. Rather, the cloud providers
have not increased their peerings as quickly as the Internet has
expanded. While Google went from 6,397 to 7,757 neighbors, the
Internet expanded from 51,801 to 69,999 ASes. Trends across time
are similar when restricted to eyeball networks as when consider-
ing all networks, with each cloud provider generally shifting in the
same direction for both sets but by a larger percentage of eyeball
networks. If we examine the cloud providers’ path lengths with re-
spect to users and weight the networks by population, we see more
noticable changes. Google has a slight increase in direct connectiv-
ity when weighted by user population, going from 57.05% in 2015
to 61.62% in 2020. Amazon and IBM show slight decreases relative
to user populations, and the percent of user population they can
reach with direct paths is less than half of Google’s: 18.74% (2015)
and 17.83% (2020) for Amazon, and 24.35% and 19.44% for IBM. This
result reinforces what we see in Section 6.7, where Google showed
the best connectivity to access networks, as well as intuition, given
that Google hosts popular first-party services for users.
Figure 13: Comparison of path length to reach destination networks
from Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft in 2015 and 2020 (num-
ber of hops is number of inter-AS links, so one hop indicates di-
rect peering from cloud provider to destination network; Microsoft
2015 traceroute data not available). The path lengths are weighted
in three ways: as percent of total networks, as percent of networks
hosting users, and as percent of users they host [2]. Path length has
remained relatively stable over time, even when weighted by popu-
lation.
(2) For each candidate ⟨facility, city⟩ we identify a RIPE Atlas
VP within 40 km of the city and in an AS that either has a
presence in the facility or is in the customer cone [64] of an
AS with a presences in the facility. We select one at randomly
if multiple VPs fit the criteria. We use RIPE Atlas ground
truth data to avoid VPs with suspicious locations [38].
(3) We ping X from each VP, and if it measures an RTT of at
most 1 ms (maximum distance of 100 km based on the speed
of light in fiber), we assume X is in the VP’s city.
E PATH LENGTH OVER TIME
The increased interconnectivity and reachability over time should
also shorten the paths for cloud providers to reach networks and
users. To examine the changes over time, we analyze AS path length
based on methods used for other analysis in this paper: we create
an AS-level topology graph for 2020 using our traceroute dataset
and for 2015 using the traceroute dataset from prior work [26],
in both cases augmented with the contemporaneous CAIDA AS
relationship datasets [15] (§4.1) and AS population data [6]. The
2015 traceroute dataset applied its own IP to AS mapping pipeline,
which was more similar to our preliminary approach than to our
final approach and so likely has a higher number of false positives
based on our validation efforts with the cloud providers (§5). We
then emulate each cloud provider announcing a prefix using the
full AS-level topology graph3 and categorize the best paths into
bins of 1, 2, or 3+ AS hops (where 1 hop indicates a direct link from
cloud provider to a network).
Figure 13 shows the number of path hops for Amazon, Google,
IBM, and Microsoft to reach all other networks on the Internet in
2015 (green bars) and 2020 (blue bars). The main result from the
prior work was to examine how close the cloud providers were
to access networks (§4.3), so we also examine path hop length for
only user (eyeball) networks in 2015 (red bars) and 2020 (yellow
bars). We also weight the eyeball networks by user population (§4.3)
to investigate whether Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft have
shorter paths to users (light blue bars for 2015 data and purple bars
for 2020 data).
3The CAIDA Dataset classifies Cloudflare (AS 13335) as a provider of IBM. Our tracer-
outes only see it providing transit for a small number of destinations, but in simulation
Cloudflare appears in the majority of AS paths. We remove it from the IBM calculations
in order for our emulated paths to better reflect actual paths. The classification of
Cloudflare as a transit for IBM does not affect any of our other calculations or results.
