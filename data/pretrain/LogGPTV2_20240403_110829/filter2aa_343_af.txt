All these applications are included with Mac OS X Server and can be installed on 
another computer with Mac OS X version 10.3 or later, making that computer an 
administrator computer. For more information on setting up an administrator 
computer, see the server administration chapter of the getting started guide.
Server Admin
You use Server Admin to:
• Set up Mac OS X Server as an Open Directory master, an Open Directory replica, a 
server that’s connected to a directory system, or a standalone server with only a local 
directory. For instructions, see Chapter 5, “Setting Up Open Directory Services.”
• Set up additional Mac OS X Server systems to use the Kerberos KDC of an Open 
Directory master or replica. For instructions, see Chapter 5.
• Migrate an upgraded server’s shared directory domain from NetInfo to LDAP. For 
instructions, see Chapter 5.
• Configure LDAP options on an Open Directory master. For instructions, see 
Chapter 5.
• Configure DHCP service to supply an LDAP server address to Mac OS X computers 
with automatic search policies. For instructions, see the DHCP chapter of the network 
services administration guide.
• Set up password policies that apply to all users who don’t have overriding individual 
password policies. For instructions, see Chapter 6, “Managing User Authentication.” 
(To set up individual password policies, use Workgroup Manager; see Chapter 6.)
• Monitor Open Directory services. For instructions, see Chapter 8, “Maintenance and 
Problem Solving.”

5 Setting Up Open Directory 
Services
You can use Server Admin to set up the Open Directory 
role of a server, set up single signon and Kerberos 
authentication services, configure LDAP options, and 
migrate from NetInfo to LDAP.
Open Directory services—directory services and authentication services—are an 
essential part of a network’s infrastructure. These services have a significant effect on 
other network services and on users. Therefore Open Directory must be set up correctly 
from the beginning. 
Setup Overview
Here is a summary of the major tasks you perform to set up Open Directory services. 
See the pages indicated for detailed information about each step.
Step 1:  Before you begin, do some planning
See “Before You Begin” on page 54 for a list of items to think about before you 
configure Open Directory on Mac OS X Server.
Step 2:  Set up your Open Directory master
See “Setting Up an Open Directory Master” on page 56 and “Setting LDAP Options” on 
page 63.
Step 3:  Set up replicas of your Open Directory master
See “Setting Up an Open Directory Replica” on page 57 and “Setting LDAP Options” on 
page 63.
Step 4:  Set up servers that connect to other directory systems
See “Setting Up a Connection to a Directory System” on page 60.
Step 5:  Set up single signon and Kerberos authentication
See “Setting Up Single Signon and Kerberos” on page 61.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
Step 6:  Migrate upgraded servers from NetInfo to LDAP
See “Migrating a Directory Domain From Netinfo to LDAP” on page 66 and “Disabling 
NetInfo After Migrating to LDAP” on page 69.
Step 7:  Set up Directory Access on servers and client computers
See Chapter 7, “Managing Directory Access.”
Before You Begin
Before setting up Open Directory services for the first time:
• Understand the uses of directory data and assess your directory needs.
Identify the services that require data from directory domains, and determine which 
users will need access to those services.
Users whose information can be managed most easily on a server should be defined 
in the shared LDAP directory of a Mac OS X Server that is an Open Directory master. 
Some of these users may instead be defined in directory domains on other servers, 
such as an Active Directory domain on a Windows server.
These concepts are discussed in Chapter 1, “Directory Service Concepts.”
• Assess whether you need more than one shared domain. If so, decide which users 
will be defined in each shared domain. See Chapter 2, “Open Directory Search 
Policies,” for more information. 
• Determine which authentication options users need. For descriptions of the available 
options, see Chapter 3, “User Authentication With Open Directory.”
• Decide how to organize your directory domains, including replicas of Open Directory 
masters. Chapter 4, “Open Directory Planning,” provides some guidelines.
• Pick server administrators very carefully. Give only trusted people administrator 
passwords. Have as few administrators as possible. Don’t delegate administrator 
access for minor tasks, such as changing settings in a user record. 
Important:  Directory information is authoritative. It vitally affects everyone whose 
computers use it.
Setting Up Open Directory With Server Assistant
The initial setup of Open Directory occurs when you use Server Assistant during 
installation of Mac OS X Server. For instructions on using Server Assistant, see the 
getting started guide.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
55
Managing Open Directory on a Remote Server
You can install Server Admin on a computer with Mac OS X version 10.3 or later and use 
it to manage Open Directory on any server locally or remotely. You can also manage 
Open Directory remotely by using command-line tools from a Mac OS X computer or a 
non-Macintosh computer. For more information, see the server administration chapter 
of the getting started guide.
Setting Up a Standalone Server
Using Server Admin, you can set up Mac OS X Server to use only the server’s local 
directory domain. The server does not provide directory information to other 
computers or get directory information from an existing system. (The local directory 
domain cannot be shared.)
Important:  If you change Mac OS X Server to get directory information only from its 
local directory domain, then user records and other information that the server 
formerly retrieved from a shared directory domain will become unavailable:
• The user records and other information will still exist in the shared directory domain 
but will become unavailable to the server’s users and services. 
• Files and folders on the server may become unavailable to users whose accounts are 
in the shared directory domain. 
• If the server was an Open Directory master and other servers were connected to it:
• Services may be disrupted on the connected servers when the user accounts and 
other information in the shared directory domain become unavailable.
• Users whose accounts are in the shared directory domain may no longer be able 
to access files and folders on the Open Directory master and on other servers that 
were connected to its shared LDAP directory domain. 
You can back up the LDAP directory and Open Directory Password Server database 
before changing from Open Directory master to standalone server. For instructions, see 
“Backing Up Open Directory Files” on page 118. 
To configure a server to use only its own nonshared local directory domain:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for a server in the Computers & Services 
list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
3 Choose Standalone Server from the Role pop-up menu.
4 If you are sure that users and services no longer need access to the directory data 
stored in the shared directory domain that the server has been hosting or connected 
to, click Save.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
Setting Up an Open Directory Master
Using Server Admin, you can set up Mac OS X Server to be an Open Directory master 
so it can provide directory information and authentication information to other 
systems. Mac OS X Server provides directory information by hosting a shared LDAP 
directory domain. In addition, the server authenticates users whose accounts are stored 
in the shared LDAP directory domain. 
Important:  If you change a Mac OS X Server computer that was connected to another 
directory system to be an Open Directory master instead, the server remains connected 
to the other directory system. The server will search for user records and other 
information in its shared LDAP directory domain before searching in other directory 
systems to which it is connected.
To configure a server to host a shared LDAP domain:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for a server in the Computers & Services 
list.
A server must have Mac OS X Server version 10.3 or later to be an Open Directory 
master.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
3 Choose Open Directory Master from the Role pop-up menu and enter the requested 
information.
Administrator short name:  The short name of an administrator account in the server’s 
local directory domain that you want to have copied to the new shared LDAP directory. 
This account will be an administrator of the LDAP directory domain.
Administrator password:  The password for the administrator account whose short 
name you entered.
Kerberos realm name:  By convention, the Kerberos realm name is the same as the 
server’s DNS name but in all uppercase letters. For example, a server whose DNS name 
is example.com would have a Kerberos realm name of EXAMPLE.COM.
Search base (optional):  The search base suffix for the new LDAP directory. Typically, 
the search base suffix is derived from the server’s DNS name. For example, the search 
base suffix could be “dc=example, dc=com” for a server whose DNS name is 
server.example.com.
4 Click OK, then click Save.
After setting up a Mac OS X Server computer to be an Open Directory master, you can 
configure other computers with Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server to access the server’s 
shared LDAP directory domain:

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
57
• You can configure DHCP service to supply the Open Directory master as an LDAP 
server to computers with automatic search policies. Computers with Mac OS X or 
Mac OS X Server version 10.2 can have automatic search policies. These computers 
don’t have to be configured individually to access the LDAP server. When these 
computers start up, they try to get the address of an LDAP server from DHCP service.
• You can configure a computer to access the server’s LDAP directory and then add the 
server’s LDAP directory to the computer’s custom search policy.
For instructions on configuring DHCP to supply an LDAP server’s address, see the 
network services administration guide. For instructions on setting up search policies 
and configuring access to specific LDAP directory domains, see Chapter 7, “Managing 
Directory Access.” 
Setting Up an Open Directory Replica
Using Server Admin, you can set up Mac OS X Server to be a replica of an Open 
Directory master so it can provide the same directory information and authentication 
information to other systems as the master. The replica server hosts a read-only copy of 
the master’s LDAP directory domain. The replica server also hosts a read/write copy of 
the authentication database associated with the master directory domain and the 
Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).
Open Directory replicas can provide these benefits:
• In a wide area network (WAN) of local area networks (LANs) interconnected by slow 
links, replicas on the LANs can provide servers and client computers with fast access 
to user accounts and other directory information.
• A replica provides redundancy. If the Open Directory master fails, computers 
connected to it automatically switch to a nearby replica. This automatic failover 
behavior is a feature of version 10.3 and later of Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server.
Important:  When you set up an Open Directory replica, all the directory and 
authentication data must be copied to it from the Open Directory master. Replication 
may take several seconds or several minutes depending on the size of the directory 
domain. Replication over a slow network link can take a very long time. During 
replication, the master cannot provide directory or authentication services. User 
accounts in the master LDAP directory can’t be used to log in or authenticate for 
services until replication is finished. To minimize the disruption of directory service, set 
up a replica before the master LDAP directory is fully populated or at a time of day 
when the directory service is not needed. Having another replica already set up will 
insulate clients of directory service from the master being unavailable.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
Important:  If you change a Mac OS X Server computer that was connected to another 
directory system to be an Open Directory replica instead, the server remains connected 
to the other directory system. The server will search for user records and other 
information in its shared LDAP directory domain before searching in other directory 
systems to which it is connected.
To configure a server to host a replica of an Open Directory master:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for a server in the Computers & Services 
list.
A server must have Mac OS X Server version 10.3 or later to be an Open Directory 
replica.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
3 Choose Open Directory Replica from the Role pop-up menu and enter the requested 
information.
IP address of LDAP master:  Enter the IP address of the server that is the Open 
Directory master.
root’s password on LDAP master:  Enter the password of the Open Directory master 
system’s root user (user name System Administrator).
Password Server admin’s name on replica:  Enter the name of an administrator 
account whose password type is Open Directory.
Password Server admin’s password on replica:  Enter the password of the 
administrator account whose name you entered.
4 Click OK, then click Save.
5 Make sure the date, time, and time zone are correct on the replica and the master.
The replica and the master should use the same network time service so their clocks 
remain in sync.
After you set up an Open Directory replica, other computers will connect to it 
automatically as needed. Computers with version 10.3 and later of Mac OS X and 
Mac OS X Server maintain a list of all replicas of an Open Directory master to which 
they are connected. If one of these computers can’t contact the Open Directory master 
for directory and authentication services, the computer automatically connects to the 
nearest replica of the master.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
59
You can configure Mac OS X computers to connect to an Open Directory replica 
instead of the Open Directory master for directory and authentication services. On each 
Mac OS X computer, you can use Directory Access to create an LDAPv3 configuration 
for accessing the replica’s LDAP directory and set up a custom search policy that 
includes this LDAPv3 configuration. You can also configure a DHCP service to supply 
the replica’s LDAP directory to Mac OS X computers that get the address of an LDAP 
server from the DHCP service. See “Accessing LDAP Directories” on page 90 and 
“Defining Automatic Search Policies” on page 88. See the network services 
administration guide for instructions on setting up DHCP service to supply an LDAP 
server’s address. 
The Open Directory master automatically updates the replica. You can configure the 
master to update its replicas at a specific interval or whenever the master directory 
changes. For instructions, see “Setting the Replication Frequency of an Open Directory 
Master” on page 64. 
Setting Up Open Directory Failover
If an Open Directory master or any of its replicas become unavailable, its client 
computers with Mac OS X version 10.3 or Mac OS X Server version 10.3 will 
automatically find an available replica and connect to it. 
Replicas only allow clients to read directory information. Directory information on a 
replica can’t be modified with administration tools such as Workgroup Manager.
Users whose password type is Open Directory can change their passwords on 
computers that are connected to Open Directory replicas. The replicas automatically 
synchronize password changes with the master. If the master is unavailable for a while, 
the replicas synchronize password changes with the master when it becomes available 
again.
If an Open Directory master or replica becomes unavailable and it has client computers 
with version 10.2 or earlier of Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server, these client computers 
must be reconfigured manually to connect to an available replica. You can use 
Directory Access to create an LDAPv3 configuration that specifies how the computer 
accesses an available replica. For instructions, see “Accessing LDAP Directories” on 
page 90.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services
Setting Up a Connection to a Directory System
Using Server Admin, you can set up Mac OS X Server to get user records and other 
directory information from another server’s shared directory domain. The other server 
also provides authentication for its directory information. Mac OS X Server will still get 
directory information from its own local directory domain and will provide 
authentication for this directory information.
Important:  Changing Mac OS X Server to be connected to another directory system 
instead of being an Open Directory master will deactivate its shared LDAP directory 
domain, with the following ramifications:
• User records and other directory information will still exist in the deactivated 
directory domain but will be unavailable to the server’s users and services. 
• If other servers were connected to the master directory domain, their services may 
be disrupted when the user accounts and other information in the deactivated 
directory domain become unavailable.
• Users who had accounts in the deactivated directory domain may no longer be able 
to access files and folders on the Open Directory master and on other servers that 
were connected to the master directory domain. 
To configure a server to get directory services from an existing system:
1 Open Server Admin and select Open Directory for a server in the Computers & Services 
list.
2 Click Settings (near the bottom of the window), then click General (near the top).
3 Choose “Connected to a Directory System” from the Role pop-up menu.
4 If the server was an Open Directory master and you are sure that users and services no 
longer need access to the directory data stored in the shared directory domain that the 
server has been hosting, click Save.
5 Click the Open Directory Access button to configure access to one or more directory 
systems.
For instructions on configuring access to a particular kind of directory service, see 
Chapter 7, “Managing Directory Access.”
Note:  If you connect Mac OS X Server version 10.3 or later to a directory domain of 
Mac OS X Server version 10.2 or earlier, be aware that users defined in the older 
directory domain cannot be authenticated with the MS-CHAPv2 method. This method 
may be required to securely authenticate users for the VPN service of Mac OS X Server 
version 10.3 and later. Open Directory in Mac OS X Server version 10.3 supports MS-
CHAPv2 authentication, but Password Server in Mac OS X Server version 10.2 does not 
support MS-CHAPv2.

Chapter 5    Setting Up Open Directory Services

Setting Up Single Signon and Kerberos
Setting up single signon and Kerberos authentication involves these tasks:
• An administrator who has authority to manage directory domains sets up a server as 
an Open Directory master, which hosts a Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC). See 
“Setting Up an Open Directory Master for Single Signon and Kerberos” on page 61.
• The network administrator delegates to specific server administrators the authority 
to join their servers to the Open Directory master server for single signon and 
Kerberos authentication. (If you want to set up a server to join an Open Directory 
master for single signon and Kerberos, you must delegate authority to yourself.) See 
“Delegating Authority to Join an Open Directory Master for Single Signon and 
Kerberos” on page 62.
• Delegated administrators join their servers to the Open Directory master, which then 
provides single signon and Kerberos authentication for services provided by the 
servers that have joined. See “Joining a Server to an Open Directory Master for Single 
Signon and Kerberos” on page 63.
• All computers using single signon and Kerberos should be set to the correct date, 
time, and time zone. They should all be configured to use the same network time 
server. Kerberos depends on the clocks of all participating computers being in sync.
• DNS must be available on the network.
