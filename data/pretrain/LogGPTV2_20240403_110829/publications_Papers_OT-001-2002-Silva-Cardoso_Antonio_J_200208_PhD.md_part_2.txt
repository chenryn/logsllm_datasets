### Workflow Management and Quality of Service in Modern Business Environments

#### Introduction
Workflow management systems (WMS) are designed to manage and streamline business processes. However, organizations operating in e-commerce and global markets face new challenges that current WMS technologies do not fully address. One critical requirement is the management of quality of service (QoS). In modern markets, such as e-commerce, QoS management is essential for ensuring that products and services meet well-defined specifications, leading to customer satisfaction.

#### Importance of QoS in Modern Markets
While QoS has been a major concern in networking (Cruz 1995; Georgiadis et al. 1996), real-time applications (Clark et al. 1992), and middleware (Zinky et al. 1997; Frolund and Koistinen 1998; Hiltunen et al. 2000), few research efforts have focused on enhancing WMS to support QoS management. For organizations, characterizing workflows based on QoS offers several advantages:

1. **Efficient Translation of Vision**: Workflows can be designed according to QoS specifications, allowing organizations to translate their vision into business processes more effectively.
2. **Selection and Execution Based on QoS**: Workflows can be selected and executed based on their QoS, better fulfilling customer expectations. This is particularly important for e-commerce, where the QoS of an application must be known before it is made available to customers.
3. **Monitoring and Adaptation**: Workflows can be monitored throughout their lifecycle to ensure compliance with initial QoS requirements. Monitoring allows for the triggering of adaptation strategies when metrics deviate from expected values or thresholds are reached.
4. **Evaluation of Alternative Strategies**: When adaptation is necessary, potential alternatives can be generated and evaluated to ensure that the workflow continues to meet initial QoS requirements.

#### Customer Expectations and Satisfaction
Meeting customer expectations and ensuring satisfaction are crucial. Quality models like ISO9000 (ISO9000 2002) have been developed to help organizations and their employees meet these needs. Workflow QoS is composed of various dimensions used to characterize workflow schema and instances. Developing a comprehensive QoS model specification and its computation, covering multiple quality dimensions, is innovative.

#### Current Research and Challenges
Most research on extending WMS capabilities to include project management features has focused on the time dimension (Kao and GarciaMolina 1993; Bussler 1998; Eder et al. 1999; Marjanovic and Orlowska 1999; Dadam et al. 2000; Sadiq et al. 2000; Son et al. 2001). However, this is just one aspect of workflow QoS. The Crossflow project (Klingemann et al. 1999; Damen et al. 2000; Grefen et al. 2000) considers both time and cost, but its approach to handling parallel executions can become computationally infeasible for large workflows. Our approach uses a different method to compute QoS dimensions, avoiding exponential complexity.

#### Goals and Objectives
Our goal is to develop a model for specifying workflow QoS and methods for computing, estimating, and analyzing QoS. We aim to identify relevant QoS dimensions and develop algorithms to compute workflow QoS based on the QoS of individual tasks.

### Semantic Workflow Composition

E-services are seen as the next wave of Internet-based business applications (Fabio Casati et al. 2001). With the development of infrastructures supporting e-services, organizations are incorporating Web services into their business processes. WMS can integrate business objects to set up e-services quickly and cost-effectively (Shegalov et al. 2001). Workflows play a significant role in dynamic trading processes, value chains, and virtual organizations.

#### Challenges in Modeling E-Services
Modeling e-services using workflows presents two main challenges:
1. **Web Service Discovery**: Efficiently finding Web services that meet functional and operational requirements from the vast number available on the Internet.
2. **Interoperability**: Resolving structural and semantic differences among heterogeneous Web services to ensure they interoperate within a workflow.

#### Traditional vs. E-Service Workflow Design
Traditional workflow design involves selecting tasks from a repository and establishing connections. However, when modeling e-services, the number of Web services available is significantly larger, making manual selection impractical. Interoperability issues, including structural and semantic heterogeneity, need to be addressed. Semantic integration typically involves mapping local terms onto a shared ontology, but this approach is costly and difficult to maintain (Rodríguez and Egenhofer 2002).

#### Proposed Solution
Our approach uses ontologies to describe Web service interfaces and assesses the similarity of terms and concepts using Tversky’s feature-based similarity model (Tversky 1977). This model is based on the idea that common features increase perceived similarity, while feature differences decrease it.
