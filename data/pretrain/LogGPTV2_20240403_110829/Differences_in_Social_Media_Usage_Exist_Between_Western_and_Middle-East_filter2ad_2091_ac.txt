decreases the available votes per post, which can inﬂuence community moderation
techniques that depend on voting.
6.2 Spinning Faster: Response Time and Volume
While voting or liking is a vital part of a social network, it can only exist because
of posted content and replies. We thus next study geographic properties that
inﬂuence the response time and volume.
In Fig. 5a, we show the amounts of posts with and without replies (bars)
and the ratio (lines) across time for both countries. The German communities
increase their response cover over time, while it instantly is equally high for the
Diﬀrences in Social Media
421
SA communities at about 90%. I.e., 9 out of 10 users in both countries can
expect getting at least a single reply on a thread.
Response Volume. As most users receive a reply, does the total achieved thread
length correlate with community size, and how does this interplay with the
distribution shift in content creation? We answer this question with distributions
given in Fig. 5b as a box plot, which depicts the thread length gathered per post
across time (DE0, ...) and community sizes (is q0 25, ...).
First, the 95% percentile whiskers indicate a long-tailed distribution in the
length of threads, which we conﬁrm (now shown). Second, the amount of replies
is invariant to community size as the distributions are very similar; however,
there still exists a huge spread from the 75% to the 95% percentile (whiskers)
due to the long-tailed distribution. Second, we observe an increasing trend over
time. This increasing engagement is also apparent when looking deeper into the
interactions (cf. Sect. 4.2 and alike split by community size—not shown).
Findings. Most posts in both countries get a reply; even at larger volumes for
SA, the thread lengths are similar to DE.
Conversations. Having established an understanding of the amount of replies
most users experience, we get into more structural detail. We deﬁne conservation-
ness as the ratio between replies per replier as a proxy for conversations—where
lower ratios naturally depict a heterogeneous set of repliers, while higher ratios
indicate fewer participants forming a back and forth conversation.
We present the distributions of this ratio over time for both countries in
Fig. 6a as box plots; the 95% whisker indicates long-tailed distributions, which
we can conﬁrm (not shown). Over time and with increasing network activity,

Replies per thread partic-
ipant are long-tailed and

(b) Thread engagement speed. The median timeframe
between consecutive answers within a thread decreases
over time in the meanwhile growing DE environ-
ment. Likewise, larger communities experience faster
responses—in SA widely immediately.

all German communities increase up to about 1.6 replies per thread participant
within the 75% quantile in DE0. This indicates a shift from rather random
single comments becoming less popular in favor of interacting with each other.
Given the high preference on creating content and vividly replying, this trend
is particularly apparent and reinforced in the SA communities at rates of up to
two replies for the 75% quantile of SA0.
Findings. Employing a conservationness metric, we identify SA users to be
more conversational compared to DE.
Response Time. We have seen that most threads receive at least some replies.
While the counts in responses may matter quantitatively, we also want to shed
light on the time-dependent dynamics of the reply interactions. Figure 6b shows
a box plot of the distributions of the time between consecutive responses within
a thread split by time (DE0, ...) and community size (q0 25, ...); note the log
y-scale. Unfortunately, our dataset does not allow for this evaluation on vote
interactions (see Sect. 3).
From this evaluation, we gain two major insights: 1) throughout time with
increasing activity and engagement, the German communities establish shorter
response times down to only minutes. Having reached a sustainable community
size, the response times no longer drop. 2) The SA communities instantly drop
response times substantially below the German counterpart to only a single
minute within most threads. Note: High response times within small communities
in SA1 are due to small amounts of data; Missing series indicate no present data.
Findings. In comparison to DE, the SA communities are more vividly responsive
as the average response times are considerably lower.
7 Related Work
The research community established a rich ﬁeld of understanding human inter-
action within social media, yet not studying geographic diﬀerences in social
media usage. Empirical studies on social media focused on the birth and
growth [22,27,29], social media usage in speciﬁc regions such as the Arab Gulf
states [27] speciﬁcally focused to global usage [17], information propagration [6],
speciﬁc platforms such as Facebook [18,24], YouTube [5], SnapChat [33], or
Twitter [13]. Such research tries to understand and identify social structures
and inﬂuence [11,31]. Mathematical modelling [32] and graph methods are com-
mon techniques to analyze social ties [14,19]. Platforms may also have rather
adverse eﬀects like cyberbullying [10,12,36], or may raise privacy concerns [30].
A recent body of research aims at understanding anonymous social networks.
The desire for anonymity can result in throwaway accounts [16] and can also
manifest in anonymous self disclosures [2]. Anonymous content platforms have
been detailed w.r.t. content [25] and user behavior [1,7,26]. Other empirical work
focuses speciﬁcally on location based anonymous platforms, e.g., Whisper [34]
or Yik Yak [21,28], or analyzes its local content [3].

We complement these works providing a new unique view on the lifecycle of
various Jodel communities in Germany and Saudi Arabia with a special focus
on happening interactions, diﬀerences and resulting platform implications.
8 Conclusions
In this paper, we show that the usage behavior of users in Germany (DE) fun-
damentally diﬀers from users in Saudi Arabia (KSA) in the anonymous and
location based Jodel network. This study is enabled by the feature of Jodel
to form independent local communities enables us to compare in-country and
between country eﬀects and thereby to clearly identify country speciﬁc usage
diﬀerences. We empirically characterizes usage behavior based on ground truth
user interaction data provided by the operator. While we can rule out marketing
eﬀects by the operator, our ﬁndings motivate future work that study root causes.
We ﬁnd that, independent of time and community size, KSA users prefer
content creation (posting & responding), while German users tend to interact
slightly more passively (voting). Other than this shift towards content, due to
the users in both regions else behaving identical on a per-user measure; we ﬁnd
rather identical community engagement. However, due to much more content
being available within SA per user, posts compete harder in gathering votes
than the German counterparts, which can have implications for vote-based con-
tent moderation schemes. Further, the average number of replies also does not
increase in comparison; Still, reply times are much smaller due to higher activ-
ity. The average Saudi user tends towards having longer conversations. Overall,
we identify time- and geographic-invariant diﬀerences between DE and SA user
engagement as the latter substantially focus on creating content, giving a slight
lead in voting to the Germans. This provides a new interaction-based perspective
on geographic diﬀerence of social media usage that have not yet been studied.
