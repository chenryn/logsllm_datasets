### 3.2.1 Comparison of ICMP, Nmap, and Passive Observation at USC

Table 3 summarizes the detection completeness of ICMP, Nmap (TCP), and passive observation methods for address utilization at the University of Southern California (USC). The table normalizes the detection rates to the union of all methods (middle column) and to any form of active probing (right column). Additionally, it shows the number of hosts uniquely detected by each method in the last rows.

| Method | Total Detected | Normalized to Any Method | Normalized to Active Probing |
|---------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **ICMP** | 17,054 | 86% | 100% |
| **TCP** | 14,794 | 74% | 86% |
| **Passive** | 25,706 | 100% | - |
| **ICMP only** | 656 | 3% | 7% |
| **TCP only** | 1,081 | 4% | 12% |
| **Passive only** | 7,720 | 30% | - |

**Table 3: Comparison of ICMP, Nmap, and passive observation of address utilization at USC.**

#### Methodology
For TCP probes, Nmap considers both SYN-ACK and RST responses as indications of host presence. Passive monitoring captures nearly all network traffic between the target network and its upstream commercial peers. An IP address is deemed active if it appears as the source address in any UDP packet or a non-SYN TCP packet. We also checked for IP addresses that generate only TCP SYNs, assuming they might be spoofed source addresses from SYN-flood attacks, but found none.

#### Analysis
1. **Absolute Accuracy**:
   - When compared to the ground truth defined by the union of all three methods, active methods significantly undercount active IP addresses. TCP misses 46%, and ICMP misses 38%.
   - This confirms that firewalls reduce the effectiveness of active probing, but active probing can still find the majority of used addresses.

2. **Relative Accuracy**:
   - ICMP is more effective than TCP-based probing. While some administrators view ICMP as a security threat, others recognize its value as a debugging tool.
   - Our experiment used different probe frequencies for ICMP and TCP due to Nmap's slower speed compared to our optimized ICMP prober. Correcting for this difference by selecting only ICMP surveys every 12 hours, ICMP coverage falls slightly to 59% of any responders or 84% of active responders.
   - Therefore, coverage is primarily influenced by the type of probing rather than probe frequency.

### 3.2.2 Evaluation from a Random Internet Sample

To remove potential bias from local or academic-specific policies, we conducted a survey of a random sample of one million allocated Internet addresses in October 2007. Details of the methodology are available in our technical report [18].

#### Methodology
- We compared one-shot TCP SYN probes to port 80 with ICMP probes.
- Absence of public, unanonymized traces limits additional wide-area evaluation.

#### Results
| Category | Addresses Probed | Non-Responding | Responding Either | ICMP | TCP | Both ICMP and TCP | ICMP Only | TCP Only |
|----------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------|-----|--------------------|------------|----------|
| **Total** | 1,000,000 | 945,703 | 54,297 | 40,033 | 34,182 | 20,115 | 14,264 | 19,918 |
| **Normalized to Any Method** | 100% | 74% | 62% | - | - | - | - | - |

**Table 4: ICMP-TCP comparison for random Internet addresses.**

- If we define addresses that respond to either ICMP or TCP as the ground truth of visible address usage, we can evaluate the accuracy of detecting active addresses.
- The results show that traffic filtering is more widespread on the Internet than at USC, with both ICMP and TCP response rates being lower (74% and 62% compared to 86% and 74%).
- Qualitatively, ICMP is more accurate than TCP-based probing, finding 74% of active addresses, which is 11% closer to our baseline.

### 3.2.3 Implications on Estimates

From these validation experiments, we draw several conclusions:

1. **Underestimation by Active Probing**:
   - Single-protocol active probing significantly underestimates Internet utilization, missing about one-third to one-half of all active addresses.
   - For visible addresses (those that will respond to some type of active probe), single-protocol active probing underestimates by one-third to one-sixth of hosts.

2. **Multi-Protocol Probing**:
   - Multi-protocol probing can discover more active addresses than single-protocol probing.
   - ICMP-only probing is consistently more accurate than TCP-only probing.
   - Operational experience suggests that TCP probing elicits 30 times more abuse complaints than ICMP, making ICMP a more feasible instrument for wide-area active probing.

3. **Correction Factor**:
   - To account for underestimation due to firewalls, we estimate that ICMP counts are 38% low. A factor of 1.61 would scale the ICMP-responsive count to estimate Internet-accessible computers, assuming USC is representative.
   - Alternatively, a less biased estimate suggests that ICMP misses 26% of TCP-responsive hosts, so visible computers should be 1.35× the number of ICMP-responsive hosts. This leads to an alternative multiplier of 1.86 to get Internet-accessible computers.

### 3.3 Measurement Location

Measurement location can be a source of bias. To rule out this potential bias, censuses since March 2006 have been conducted in pairs from two different locations in Los Angeles and Arlington, Virginia, with different network connectivity and ISPs.

#### Results
- The vast majority of blocks show similar A(block) values from both vantage points, with 96% of values agreeing within ±0.05 and a correlation coefficient of 0.99999.

### 3.4 Multi-homed Hosts and Routers

We generally assume that each host occupies only a single IP address. This assumption is violated in two cases: multi-homed hosts and routers, and hosts using different addresses at different times.

#### Alias Resolution
- Techniques like Mercator alias resolution algorithm help determine when two IP addresses belong to the same host.
- Analysis of census IT 15w found that 6.7 million addresses (6.5% of total responses) responded from a different address.

### 3.5 Probe Loss

An important limitation is the inability to distinguish between host unavailability and probe loss. Probes may be lost in the LAN, early routers, the general Internet, or near the destination.

#### Mitigation
- We minimize probe loss near the probing machines by rate-limiting outgoing probes and periodically checkpointing the state.
- For censuses, we focus on A(block) to reduce the impact of random losses.
- For surveys, we use a k-repair process to detect and repair random probe loss, with 1-repair being the default.

### 4. Evaluating Methodology Parameters

We trade off complete spatial coverage in a census for finer temporal resolution in a survey. This section evaluates how varying temporal or spatial coverage affects our observations.

#### Sampling in Time
- Increasing the sampling rate affects the fidelity of measurements. Higher sampling rates provide more detailed temporal data but may introduce more noise and complexity.
