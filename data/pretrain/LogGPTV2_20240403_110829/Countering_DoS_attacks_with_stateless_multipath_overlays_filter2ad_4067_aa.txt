ABSTRACT
Indirection-based overlay networks (IONs) are a promising approach
for countering distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Such
mechanisms are based on the assumption that attackers will attack
a ﬁxed and bounded set of overlay nodes causing service disruption
to a small fraction of the users. In addition, attackers cannot eaves-
drop on links inside the network or otherwise gain information that
can help them focus their attacks on overlay nodes that are critical
for speciﬁc communication ﬂows. We develop an analytical model
and a new class of attacks that considers both simple and advanced
adversaries. We show that the impact of these simple attacks on
IONs can severely disrupt communications.
We propose a stateless spread-spectrum paradigm to create per-
packet path diversity between each pair of end-nodes using a modi-
ﬁed ION access protocol. Our system protects end-to-end commu-
nications from DoS attacks without sacriﬁcing strong client authen-
tication or allowing an attacker with partial connectivity informa-
tion to repeatedly disrupt communications. Through analysis, we
show that an Akamai-sized overlay can withstand attacks involv-
ing over 1.3M “zombie” hosts while providing uninterrupted end-
to-end connectivity. By using packet replication, the system can
resist attacks that render up to 40% of the nodes inoperable. Sur-
prisingly, our experiments on PlanetLab demonstrate that in many
cases end-to-end latency decreases when packet replication is used,
with a worst-case increase by a factor of 2.5. Similarly, our system
imposes less than 15% performance degradation in the end-to-end
throughput, even when subjected to a large DDoS attack.

INTRODUCTION
Solving the network denial of service (DoS) problem is extremely
hard, given the fundamentally open nature of the Internet and the
apparent reluctance of router vendors and network operators to de-
ploy and operate new, potentially complex mechanisms. Overlay-
based approaches such as SOS [13] and MayDay [1] offer an at-
tractive alternative, as they do not require changes to protocols and
routers, and need only minimal collaboration from Internet Service
Providers (ISPs). Such systems use an Internet-wide network of
nodes that act as ﬁrst-level ﬁrewalls, discriminating between legit-
imate trafﬁc and potentially malicious trafﬁc, based on some form
of user or end-host authentication. Their distributed nature requires
an extremely well provisioned adversary to suppress their function-
ality, since attack trafﬁc must be split among all the nodes to disrupt
protected communications.
Indirection-based overlay network (ION) approaches depend on
the inability of an adversary to discover connectivity information
for a given client and the infrastructure (e.g., which overlay node
a client is using to route trafﬁc). This makes them susceptible to
a variety of easy-to-launch attacks that are not considered in the
standard threat model of such systems. For example, adversaries
may possess real-time knowledge of the speciﬁc overlay node(s) a
client is routing trafﬁc through, or may be attacking nodes using a
time-based scheme that will try to maximize the impact of the at-
tack on clients’ connectivity. Such attacks can be network-oriented
(e.g., TCP SYN attacks) or application-related “sweeping” attacks
or “targeted” attacks.
In targeted attacks, an attacker that has knowledge of the client’s
communication parameters can “follow” the client connections and
bring down the nodes that he tries to connect to. As soon as the
client realizes (typically after some timeout period) that the overlay
node is unresponsive and switches to a new node, the attacker also
switches the attack to this new node. Thus, an attacker that can
bring down a single node can create a targeted DoS for speciﬁc
clients. Similar attacks, exploiting information that must only be
available to trusted components of the system but which an attacker
can feasibly gain access to, are possible against almost all proposed
anti-DDoS mechanisms [24, 4, 11].
In sweeping attacks, the attacker uses its power (which is in-
sufﬁcient to bring down the whole ION) to attack a small per-
centage of the overlay nodes at a time. This type of attack tar-
gets the application-level state maintained by the overlay node re-
sponsible for a client. Destroying this state forces the client to re-
establish both network and application-level connectivity, degrad-
ing the clients’ connection and leading to DoS for time-critical or
latency-dependent applications. Thus, although IONs can counter
blind DoS attacks, they remain vulnerable to a range of simple but
debilitating attacks.
1.1 Our Approach
We believe that these inherent limitations of ﬁrst generation overlay-
based trafﬁc redirection mechanisms can be addressed by adopting
a spread-spectrum like communication paradigm1. In a “spread-
spectrum” approach, the client spreads its packets randomly across
all access points, preventing an attack from “following”. The path
diversity naturally exhibited by a distributed overlay network serves
as the “spectrum” over which communications are “spread.” In our
system, a token issued by the overlay network to the client is used to
verify the authenticity of each packet communicated by the client.
The use of a token (akin to a Kerberos ticket) alleviates the ne-
cessity to maintain application or network-level state at any of the
overlay nodes (unlike previous IONs), at the expense of bandwidth
(since the ticket must be included in every packet routed through
the ION). In return, our system is impervious to the attacks that use
this state dependence to attack the overlay.
The main challenges we must address relate to the scheme’s ef-
ﬁciency (in terms of performance and latency of the end-to-end
path), resiliency to attacks, amount of state that needs to be main-
tained by each overlay node (necessary to prevent packet replay
or forging attacks), and the elimination of communication pinch
points on which attackers can focus their attention.
We argue that such a system is feasible, and describe our speciﬁc
approach and its implementation in Sections 2 and 3, respectively.
For an attacker to successfully attack our system, he will have to
subvert or suppress 40% or more of the overlay nodes before the
system becomes unusable for all users. Thus, our system has an
operational threshold in the order of 40% of the nodes being sub-
verted. Before this 40% threshold is reached, the users will not
notice a signiﬁcant impact to their connectivity. As a comparison,
in the original SOS architecture, the user had to ﬁnd an access point
that was not under attack, which becomes increasingly difﬁcult as
we increase the portion of nodes under attack. We quantify the
increase in the system’s resistance to attacks using a simple ana-
lytical model, and provide experimental validation by deploying a
prototype over PlanetLab, a wide-area overlay network testbed.
PlanetLab nodes are distributed across the Internet, serving as an
ideal platform for experimentation.
Our analysis shows that an Akamai-sized ION (∼ 2500 nodes)
can withstand attacks that bring down up to 40% of the overlay.
This corresponds to attacks that involve several million “zombie”
(attacking) hosts, which is an order of magnitude larger than the
biggest zombie network seen to date. One expects that using an
ION will impose a performance penalty. In our case, end-to-end
latency increases by a factor of 2 in the worst case, but by using
packet replication we maintain latency at the same level as the di-
rect connection case. These results conﬁrm the ﬁndings from other
research on multipath routing [10, 3, 2]. Furthermore, end-to-end
throughput is not signiﬁcantly degraded, with an overhead of less
than 15% relative to the direct-connection case.
1.2 Contributions
The contributions of our work are:
• We introduce a realistic threat model against IONs, in which
opponents can use their limited attack capabilities against a
time-changing set of overlay nodes. In addition, we consider
more sophisticated attackers with access to information that
can be used for targeted and/or adaptive attacks against the
protection mechanisms themselves.
1Note that although we use the term “spread-spectrum” to describe
our approach, our work is not geared towards wireless networks,
nor does it touch on physical-layer issues.
• Second, we present an architecture for an overlay-based anti-
DDoS mechanism that is resistant to DDoS attacks in the new
threat model, by using stateless tokens and trafﬁc spreading.
• Third, we provide a ﬁrst attempt at an analytical model for
quantifying security in overlay-based DDoS protection mech-
anisms.
• Fourth, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a
realistic set of experiments over the Internet using PlanetLab.
• Finally, we show that the overhead of our overlay-based mech-
anism on end-to-end latency is close to zero in several us-
age scenarios, including real-time trafﬁc, which is acceptable
even for time-critical applications.
Paper Organization Section 2 describes our system architecture
using a spread-spectrum-like paradigm. The system design and
implementation are thoroughly explained in Section 3. Section 4
gives our evaluation of the system, in terms of the improvement in
resistance to attacks. Section 5 experimentally evaluates the per-
formance and attack resilience characteristics of our approach. The
paper ends with a discussion of related work and conclusions.
2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
We begin by giving an overview of how indirection-based mech-
anisms operate and describing the security issues present in the cur-
rent generation. We then describe our approach, which uses state-
less multipath overlay routing to send each packet through a ran-
domly selected overlay node. The main components of our design
are (a) a stateless protocol for authenticating users to the infrastruc-
ture such that they are not vulnerable to “step zero” attacks (DoS
attacks that prevent them from contacting the overlay), and (b) an
efﬁcient per-packet authentication scheme that allows the system to
scale to millions of users.
2.1 Overlay Protection Mechanisms & Attack
Model
The goal in combating DoS attacks is to distinguish between au-
thorized and unauthorized trafﬁc; the former is allowed to reach the
destination, while the latter is dropped or is rate-limited. Thus, at
a very basic level, we need the functionality of a ﬁrewall “deep”
enough in the network that the access link to the target does not be-
come congested. This imaginary ﬁrewall performs access control
by using protocols such as IPsec or TLS. Trafﬁc is then routed to
a secret location, which may be the server itself or a node that is
allowed to contact the server (called “secret servlet” in SOS [13]),
with all other trafﬁc being ﬁltered. The reason for having a small
number of secret servlets is to minimize the number of ﬁltering
rules, as they can affect router performance. The secret servlet may
vary over time, and may differ for each protected site.
Most such systems concern themselves with naive attackers, i.e.,
those without internal knowledge of the system (other than the
list of participating nodes). We assume that such an attacker can
mount a DoS attack against a small set of nodes in the overlay for
short periods of time, which will force clients using those overlay
nodes to reset their connections to new nodes. This attacker blindly
“sweeps” all the nodes participating in overlay network focusing
the attack from one set of overlay nodes to another, selecting nodes
not previously attacked. Presently, a number of DoS attacks can be
used as “sweeping” attacks: TCP SYN, ICMP ﬂooding and TCP
congestion attacks are among them. If the overhead of detecting
the failure and switching to a new access point is high, compared to
how long an attack must be sustained to force the connection reset,
an attacker can cause signiﬁcant disruption in the communications.
Performance can be seriously degraded, and long-lived connections
(such as a teleconference or a large ﬁle transfer) can be repeatedly
disrupted, rendering them ineffective as communication carriers.
This attack is similar to a radio jammer that is randomly broad-
casting noise in various channels, forcing communicating parties
to continuously reset their network parameters.
Although less efﬁcient against a single user compared to a tar-
geted attack, this attack can be more effective, degrading the con-
nection characteristics or preventing connectivity on most of the
clients connected to the overlay. The success of the attack depends
on factors such as the attack intensity2, and the time required to
detect the connection failure and then ﬁnd a new overlay node that
is healthy and re-establish both network connection and client au-
thentication credentials (usually on the application level). More-
over, the client’s authentication can be complex, e.g., using X.509
certiﬁcates for authentication or Graphic Turing Tests [21] to allow
anonymous human users. Most such authentication mechanisms
require time and user interaction, which make these sweeping at-
tacks a serious problem for real-world deployed overlays.
A more sophisticated attacker, explicitly not considered in other
proposed IONs, may know which overlay node a client is using. An
attacker can get this information by eavesdropping on an appropri-
ate edge-network link: the client’s wireless communications to his
access point or the link to his ISP. Such an attacker can “follow”
the client and direct DoS trafﬁc against the overlay nodes that he
tries to communicate with. The client, detecting a failure in com-
munications, will select another node to access the overlay, which
will become the attacker’s new target. Using the radio communica-
tions analogy, this is akin to an adversary that is eavesdropping on
wireless communications, jamming frequencies where trafﬁc is de-
tected; after a short period of time, the adversary searches for new
frequencies the attacked parties may have switched to. [1] identi-
ﬁes possible ways an adversary can gain such information; other
possibilities include snooping on the local network link, e.g., in a
wide-area wireless network such as the upcoming WiMAX, or in
some enterprise-wide 802.11 (WiFi) environments.
This threat model is considerably stronger than the typical sce-
narios anti-DDoS mechanism designers have considered in the past.
We can address all of the above attacks by employing a nearly-
stateless spread-spectrum communication paradigm in conjunction
with an overlay network.
2.2 Trafﬁc Spreading
The ﬁrst problem we address is how to protect the communi-
cations of a client of the overlay from attackers that either have
partial knowledge of the communication parameters (i.e., can de-
termine which overlay nodes a client is communicating with), or
are blindly attacking overlay nodes using “sweeping” attacks, thus
forcing clients to keep re-establishing connections to new overlay
nodes. For simplicity, we temporarily assume that the reverse chan-
nel (from the overlay to the client) is protected by the overlay in the
same manner communications to the server are protected, or is oth-
erwise safe from interference.
Our approach, shown in Figure 1, is straightforward: spread the
packets from the client across all overlay nodes in a pseudo-random
manner storing no network or application level state in the overlay
nodes. An attacker will not know which nodes to direct an attack
to; randomly attacking a subset of them will only cause a fraction of
the client’s trafﬁc to be dropped. By using forward error correction
(FEC) or simply duplicating packets (i.e., sending the same packet
2In this context, attack intensity is the percentage of overlay nodes
that can be brought down simultaneously by the attacker.

tacks that render a number of overlay nodes ineffective do not impact
end-to-end communications.
through two or more different access points simultaneously), we
can guarantee packet delivery with high probability, if we place an
upper bound on the number of nodes an attacker can simultaneously
attack. We quantify this increase in attack resistance in Section 4.
In designing our system, we must address several issues:
• First, it should not be possible for an attacker to impersonate
a legitimate user and conduct a DoS attack through the over-
lay. This means that each packet from the user to the overlay
must be properly authenticated.
• The second issue we must address is the state that each over-
lay node must maintain per client: since all overlay nodes
can potentially receive trafﬁc from all users, the memory re-
quirements can quickly become prohibitive. Furthermore, a
client’s end-to-end connection must not depend on the net-
work availability of a small set of overlay nodes. Keeping
state that is essential for a client’s network or application
level connectivity makes the system vulnerable to sweeping
or targeted attacks.
• Third, even legitimate clients should not be allowed to “pump”
