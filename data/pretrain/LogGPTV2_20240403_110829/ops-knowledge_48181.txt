User:  Please introduce the commonly used open source databases and their characteristics.
Assistant: Currently commonly used open source databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Cassandra. 1. MySQL: MySQL is a relational database management system that supports features such as multi-thread processing and stored procedures. It has high performance and scalability, and is suitable for large-scale data storage and high concurrent access. MySQL uses the GPL agreement, which is an open source and free database system. 2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a highly scalable, open-source database that supports concurrent processing of operating systems, multi-version control, and integrity checks, making it suitable for data scales of tens of millions. PostgreSQL's license is the BSD protocol, which provides a higher level of data integrity and security than MySQL. 3. MongoDB: MongoDB is an open source database system written in C++ language based on document storage, suitable for large-scale, distributed database scenarios. MongoDB supports features such as horizontal expansion, self-healing, instant backup and recovery, and also supports MapReduce data processing, and has highly flexible indexing capabilities. 4. Redis: Redis is a memory-based open source database that supports multiple data structures, transaction processing, and other functions, and is suitable for different scenarios such as cache, message queue, data storage, and counter. Redis's data persistence methods include snapshot and AOF modes, which can realize cold backup, recovery and migration of data. 5. Cassandra: Cassandra is a distributed database system that supports scalability, high performance, and fault tolerance across multiple data centers, and is suitable for large-scale real-time data applications. Cassandra's data model is a columnar database mode, which supports more complex query and data analysis operations, and can also write and read data quickly.
