I think the issue is self explanatory when looking at the code below. The
second boolean should be False.  
Is this intended? If so, should there be some kind of Warning for the user? I
couldn't figure why my code wasn't working until I realized that I have to
convert my numpy array to a normal list.
### Reproducing code example:
    import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.array([['a','b','c'], ['d','e','f']])
    >>> ['a','b','c'] in a
    True
    >>> ['c','b','a'] in a
    True```
