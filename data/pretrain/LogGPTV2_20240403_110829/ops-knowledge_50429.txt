User:  company needs to upgrade the main database without affecting the online business. Please provide a feasible upgrade plan.
Assistant: The following is a feasible upgrade solution: 1. Before upgrading the main database, make sure that the backup and recovery mechanism has been perfected. Backup can consider full backup and incremental backup to deal with various problems that may arise. At the same time, the integrity and recovery of backups need to be tested to ensure the availability of backups. 2. During backup and upgrade, online business needs to be suspended to ensure data consistency. During the pause period, you can consider using the method of writing to the binlog during backup to record SQL updates, so that these updates can be applied to the new primary database after recovery to avoid loss of business data. 3. Install the new primary database and restore the backup data to the new database. After confirming that the recovery process was correct, make configuration changes to existing applications to switch to the new database. 4. After switching to the new primary database, testing is required, including data consistency, application stability, transaction reliability, etc. At the same time, full-link and stress tests are required to ensure that the performance and availability of the new database meet the requirements of online businesses. 5. After completing the test, start the online business again to ensure that the database upgrade has no impact on the online business. 6. Finally, make regular backups and check the quality of the backups. At the same time, it is necessary to monitor indicators such as database performance, space usage, and error logs, and use tools for inspection and automated operation and maintenance management to ensure the stability and reliability of database operation.
