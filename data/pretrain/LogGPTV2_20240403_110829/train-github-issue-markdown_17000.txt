Suppose we wish to form a prediction by bagging a number of SVCs.
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
    # get data
    feat=np.random.normal(size=(100,2))
    lbl=np.random.choice(a=3,p=[.45,.45,.1],size=100,replace=True)
    wghts=np.ones(shape=(100,))
    # fit ensemble
    bc=BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=SVC(probability=True),n_estimators=10,max_samples=.1)
    bc=bc.fit(feat,lbl,sample_weight=wghts)
    # predict
    pred=bc.predict(feat) # raises Exception
Because the third case has a relatively low probability (10%), some of the
bootstrap draws do not contain it. As a result, some SVCs are fitted to 3
classes, and some SVCs are fitted to 2. This is a problem because bc.predict
does a simple sum of probabilities across the 100 SVCs, where the number of
classes is not always 3. This bug triggers the following error:
    ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (100,3) (100,2) (100,3)
numpy version 1.11.3  
sklearn version 0.18.1
Thank you.
