Question: A developer suggests that checking for '../' at the beginning of a user-supplied file path is sufficient for preventing path traversal attacks. Analyze the scenario and select the reason(s) why this practice is insufficient:
"A": "Attackers can bypass the check by placing '../' sequences after the first few characters of the input.",
"B": "The check only removes the '../' sequence once, an attacker could include it multiple times to traverse to restricted directories.",
"C": "This method does not account for alternative path traversal sequences such as './' and '//', which can also be used in attacks.",
"D": "Removing '../' sequences may inadvertently alter legitimate user inputs that contain these characters as part of valid file or directory names."
Answer: AB
