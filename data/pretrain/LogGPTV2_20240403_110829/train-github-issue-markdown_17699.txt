# Environment
    Windows build number: 
    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18362.267]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable):
    Windows Terminal (Preview)
    Version: 0.3.2142.0
    Any other software?
    None
# Steps to reproduce
Start terminal. Resize. I pretty consistently get a crash when I get to about
the point of the single tab going to zero width.
Start terminal. Add multiple tabs. Resize. I get crashes when the third tab
starts to slide under the new tab UI.
Sometimes you can shrink all the way down and back. Sometimes you can shrink
all the way down, and it'll crash as it is being expanded.
# Expected behavior
Window resizes without crash
# Actual behavior
