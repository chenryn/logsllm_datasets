User: I am a pretty recent developer..
but I have a single monitor (big enough) but it is so annoying that every now and then I first use the text editor to write the code and then go to terminal to execute and debug
I was wondering if there is any developer tools where I can like use half screen for that note pad and the other half for terminal.. so that I dont have to shuffle back and forth between the terminal and the text-editor...
Something like, when this software is running... then notepad and terminal just freezes in that half screen and when i close this software I can minimize and turn to normal mode.
If not it would be cool thing to have. :D
THanks
Assistant: Use ViM in split window mode, edit your script on the left side and start ConqueTerm (use :ConqueTerm bash) on the right side. Now you can code and execute Python code in the same terminal window at the same time using a superior text editor ;-)
Disclaimer: Of course this only helps if you are familiar with ViM already.
