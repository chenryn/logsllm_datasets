### Apache Airflow version
2.4.1
### What happened
Clicking Refresh on the graph view of any DAG does not refresh the view, it
just gets stuck refreshing forever.  
In the JS console, it displays the following error message on each refresh:
    Uncaught SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 2 of the JSON data
        N http://internal-airflow/static/dist/graph.c3f9b20b23ed9651c62a.js:2
        jQuery 7
        N http://internal-airflow/static/dist/graph.c3f9b20b23ed9651c62a.js:2
        R http://internal-airflow/static/dist/graph.c3f9b20b23ed9651c62a.js:2
        $/< http://internal-airflow/static/dist/d3.min.js:1
This happens even on a fresh DAG with no runs, even if the JSON returned by
the request to
`/object/task_instances?dag_id=test_dag&execution_date=2022-10-20T11:17:22.870600+00:00`
is empty, but also on normal DAGs.
The container logs also show no problems, just that the GET-request was made.
### What you think should happen instead
Refresh the graph.
### How to reproduce
Create a DAG with one EmptyOperator, go to graph view, click refresh.
### Operating System
CentOS 8
### Versions of Apache Airflow Providers
apache-airflow-providers-databricks  
apache-airflow-providers-microsoft-azure
### Deployment
Docker-Compose
### Deployment details
Docker version 20.10.14, build a224086
We use official image apache/airflow:2.4.1-python3.9 slightly extended with
the above providers and a custom fix for the python package `thrift` used by
the DatabricksOperator. It's a small fix just to make it work with our proxy.
### Anything else
We upgraded from 2.3.3 to 2.4.1, had no problems in 2.3.3.
Tested with Firefox and Edge, both are the same. In Edge, the error message is
`VM90:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: "[object Object]" is not valid JSON`
