The Ten Commandments for Writing Academic Papers

Academic life is governed by a certain "morality." Research is a collaborative endeavor, and we all rely on one another to make progress. Ideas are freely shared, so it is our responsibility to respect each other's intellectual property. Therefore, it is essential to adhere to specific behavioral rules, especially when writing academic papers. Good habits developed now will last a lifetime, and these are the primary ones to cultivate.

1. **Explicitly Outline Your Argument:**
   Every paper should have an introduction, a main argument, a discussion, and a conclusion. Clearly outline your argument at the beginning. Tell your reader what you are going to do, then do it, and finally, summarize what you have done. This ensures that your reader is in the same position as you from the start and can engage with your ideas as they unfold. Avoid keeping your reader in the dark about the direction of your argument, as this forces them to read the paper twice to fully understand it.

2. **Start with a Specific Problem or Question:**
   Begin with a problem or question you want to answer, not with grand theoretical frameworks. Setting up theoretical ideas at the outset can raise unrealistic expectations. Instead, start with a modest problem, which gives you a better chance of making meaningful progress. You can then surprise your reader by applying theoretical ideas to shed light on your problem.

3. **Focus on One Good Idea:**
   A single good idea is sufficient for a paper, but you must have an idea or hypothesis. Simply presenting others' work descriptively is not enough. While exploratory analysis (trying a piece of analysis without a clear hypothesis) is acceptable in the early stages of your research, it is not suitable for a substantial paper. Add your own intuition and thought, but avoid trying to solve too many problems in one paper, as this can lead to a muddled argument.

4. **Identify a Specific Problem:**
   Every paper needs a specific problem, a body of data, a body of literature, and a hypothesis. A field of study is a broad area, such as the relationship between housing and the state, which contains many possible research lines. To identify a specific problem, you need to pinpoint a question that can be answered through reference to a specific dataset. Ensure your data is rigorous and not selected to prop up a weak argument. Rehearse the conventional wisdom or state-of-the-art knowledge before presenting your own ideas, setting your work in context and showing how it relates to the field.

5. **Write in the Third Person:**
   Use the third person, e.g., "this paper sets out to...," rather than the first person. This distances you, the author, from the paper, making it a self-contained structure of ideas. The quality of the ideas should be judged independently of you as a person. Criticism should focus on clarifying the ideas, not on you personally.

6. **Present Ideas Before Evaluating Them:**
   Present the work of others clearly and dispassionately, allowing the reader to form an independent judgment. Then provide your evaluation, which the reader can agree with or not. The goal is to test all ideas, including your own, rigorously. Avoid allusion, which can come across as intellectual snobbery. Always acknowledge the sources of your ideas and the influence of others' work.

7. **Recognize the Provisional Nature of Ideas:**
   After outlining the problem, examining the literature, and analyzing your data, your ideas remain provisional. Discuss your findings, interpret them, and indicate promising lines for further research. Modesty is key; no idea is ever definitively proven, and nothing is ever absolutely true.

8. **Avoid Purple Prose:**
   Convince through reasoned argument, not through journalistic devices or adjectives. Avoid rhetorical questions and telling the reader what to think. Be cautious with normative terms like "success," "good," "failure," and "inappropriate." Avoid jargon and use simple, clear language. Imagine explaining your ideas to someone who is not an expert in the field.

9. **Use Examples:**
   Argue through concrete examples rather than abstract concepts. Illustrations, figures, and drawings should be relevant and clearly explained in the text. Ensure there is no room for misinterpretation between you and the reader.

10. **Stay Focused:**
    Like the radio program "Just a Minute," your argument should contain no hesitation, repetition, or deviation from the subject. Censor your work to eliminate anything that does not contribute to your argument. Avoid discussing issues that are not essential to your main point.

Adhering to these guidelines may not win you a Nobel Prize for Literature, but it will help you make a well-structured and valuable contribution to knowledge. If you consistently apply these criteria, you will avoid the need for me to say, "I told you so."
