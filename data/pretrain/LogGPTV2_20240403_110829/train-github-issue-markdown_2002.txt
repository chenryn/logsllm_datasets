Open attached file and zoom in a lot  
Might be reproducible only on Windows
Input from @alexandrudima :
  * check why are you getting a new gpu layer
  * we already had this issue in other trees and Joao discovered it was happening due to scroll bars
  * another reason for this might be the positioning (non integer coordinates) of the repl or the background. Though this one is unlikely
