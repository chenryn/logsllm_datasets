brand domains. Among them, only 100 (6.6%) have been
blacklisted. The registration intention of the remaining ones
could be legitimate (defensively registered by brand owners),
malicious or unknown (e.g., unresolved).
Registrants. The ﬁrst question we have about these IDNs is
how many of them were registered out of brand protection
purposes. Using WHOIS data of 1, 111 out of 1, 516 IDNs, we
manually checked whether they were registered under email
accounts of brand companies, and found only 73 (4.82%) reg-
istrations under this category. Among the remaining domains,
171 were registered by parties using personal email addresses
and others were registered anonymously (protected by WHIOS
Privacy). Though we could not verify their registrants, it is
quite unlikely that brand companies are behind them.
Brand domains. Next, we clustered the IDNs by their cor-
responding brand domains. 255 SLDs within Alexa Top 1k
are targeted by homographic IDNs, showing the diversity of
registrations. Table XIII presents the top 10 brands ordered
by the number of associated IDNs. Google, Facebook and
Amazon are the top three which are also ranked very high by
Alexa. As for brand protection, we found that only Google,
Amazon and Twitter perform protective registrations, but most
of the IDNs are out of their reach.
DNS statistics. Leveraging Farsight Passive DNS data (ex-
plained in Section III), we found that homographic IDNs
tend to have long active time. Illustrated in Figure 5(a),
homographic IDNs have 789 active days in average, with 40%
two images [56]. Compared to traditional similarity metrics
like MSE [57], SSIM strikes a good balance between accuracy
and runtime performance. Taking two images as input, this
algorithm outputs a decimal index in the range of [-1, 1], with
1 implying perfectly identical.
More speciﬁcally, an IDN image is compared to each image
of brand domain, to generate 1, 000 SSIM Indices. If the
maximum SSIM Index exceeds a certain threshold, the IDN
is considered as homographic to a brand domain. Here we
assume a homographic IDN should not impersonate more
than one brand domain. We executed the experiment on a
CentOS machine with 4GB memory, and the whole process
was completed within 102 hours.
Selection of threshold. To determine the threshold of SSIM
Index, we sampled several brand domains, replaced some
letters with homoglyphs and reviewed the similarity from the
perspective of normal users. We found the threshold works
best when set to 0.95. As shown in Table XII, when the index
drops below 0.95, the difference becomes quite prominent.
C. Registered Homographic IDNs
In total, 1, 516 IDNs (out of 1.4 million registered IDNs)
are considered homographic to Alexa Top 1k SLDs, including
91 domains which appear identically as their corresponding

(a) Active time
(b) Query volume
Fig. 5: ECDF of active time and query volume of homographic IDNs
being active for more than 600 days. Among the IDNs with
long lifetime, several IDNs are used for security education
(telling visitors the domain is a demonstration for homograph
attack, e.g., xn--fcebook-hwa.com), which could be the reason
of long lifetime.
Likewise, homographic IDNs tend to receive more DNS
requests. As shown in Figure 5(b), 80% of homographic IDNs
receive more than 100 queries, with 10% queried for over
1, 000 times. While the top three IDNs have received consider-
able volume of requests (over 100, 000), all of them are parked
(e.g., xn--instagram-5jf.com, a homograph of instagram.com).
Usage of homographic IDNs. To understand how homo-
graphic IDNs are used, we manually classiﬁed their websites
using the same methodology described in Section IV-D. Our
observation here is consistent with prior result: only a low
proportion of them are in active use. Among 100 sampled
domains, 34 are not resolvable, 10 are returning errors, 16
are for sale, 14 are parked, and 11 are hosting test pages.
However, we did identify one case of homograph attack
(xn--80aa1cn6g67a.com, which mimics alipay.com, one of the
largest online payment platform of China, and has already been
blacklisted).
D. Availability of Homographic IDNs
Our prior study investigated 1,516 registered homographic
IDNs. In this section, we further investigate the available space
of IDN registration, i.e., how many homographic IDNs are
still unregistered. From attackers’ perspective, high availability
makes domain abuse easier. To assess the availability, for
each brand domain (also Alexa top 1K SLDs), we replaced
its characters with homoglyphs to create a set of IDNs,
and computed SSIM Indices subsequently. Similarly, IDNs
with a maximum SSIM Index of over 0.95 are selected as
homographic domains.
The key problem we need to solve is how to ﬁnd homo-
glyphs for a character. Here, we leveraged a list called UC-
SimList [8], which was composed based on pixel overlap
between bitmaps of characters. To reduce the computation
overhead, only one character was replaced at a time.
In the end, we created 128, 432 new IDN domains, and dis-
covered 42, 671 of them to be homographic domains of Alexa
Top 1k SLDs (among which 237 are registered). Figure 7
presents the number of homographic IDNs (both registered
and unregistered) associated with Alexa Top 100 SLDs under
Fig. 6: Query volume of homographic IDNs
com, net or org. Clearly, attackers have lots of choices for
phishing IDNs. To notice, the number of IDNs we found so
far is just the lower-bound, as only one letter was replaced.
One may argue that not all homograph IDNs can be reg-
istered, as a registration undergoes name checks by registrars
or registries. To assess how likely the registration succeeds,
we sampled 10 homographic IDNs (e.g., xn--eay-6xy.com
and xn--sn-cxs.com) and attempted to register them through
GoDaddy. All our requests were approved.
Previous studies showed that by registering domains that
are likely to be mistyped, attackers could harvest a huge
amount of user trafﬁc and launch attacks like name server
hijacking [53]. We are interested in whether such trafﬁc also
ﬂows to homographic IDNs. As such, we queried DNS Pai
using the 42, 671 homographic IDNs and counted the volume
within Sept. 2017. The results are illustrated in Figure 6.
Although queries to unregistered IDNs are observed, their
proportion is very small. From user’s perspective, mistyping
a domain name with characters in another language is much
rarer than normal typos.
E. Summary of Findings
● Most browsers have responded to the threat from homo-
graph attacks. However, not all of them enforce the right
policies and their implementations differ. Some browsers
(e.g., Firefox) are still vulnerable even after the latest ﬁx.
● 1, 516 registered homographic IDNs are detected by our
SSIM-based approach. Among them, only 4.82% were
registered for brand protection. Most of the homographic
IDNs are yet to deliver useful content, but malicious IDNs
which escape all blacklists are discovered.
● From the perspective of adversaries, the choices of avail-
able homographic IDNs are substantial.
VII. SEMANTIC ATTACK
In this section, we present our study on IDNs which
impersonate brand domains based on semantic similarity. As
described in Section VI, we focus on Type-1 semantic attack,
which compounds a brand name with non-English keywords
(named Type-1 IDNs afterwards).

A. Detecting Type-1 IDNs
To uncover more Type-1 IDNs, instead of manual analysis,
we developed an automated approach and compared the entire
1.4 million registered IDNs with brand domains (Alexa Top
1K SLDs). In particular, we ﬁrst removed the non-ASCII
characters from all IDNs, and then computed SSIM Indices
on the rendered domain name images. Different from previous
experiments, we selected IDNs whose ASCII-only part
is
identical to a brand domain (i.e., SSIM Index equals 1.0). Our
assumption is that adding non-English keywords and replacing
ASCII characters with homoglyphs at the same time would
make the IDN quite distinguishable, reducing their chances of
fooling users.
B. Registered Type-1 IDNs
In total, 1, 497 IDNs are detected under this category. All
blacklisted phishing IDNs (see Table IX) are detected as well.
We manually checked their semantic meanings to understand
their intentions.
Brand domains. We found that 102 brand domains are
targeted by this attack, top 10 listed in Table XIV. Particularly,
36 of the brands are mainly facing Chinese customers. A
prominent reason behind these IDNs is to impersonate a brand
service. For instance, we observed that every Type-1 IDN
related to 58.com (the biggest website serving classiﬁed ads in
China) appends a service keyword to “58” (e.g.,
,
meaning 58 automobile). From WHOIS data of all 1,497
domains, we found that only 45 IDNs were registered under
email accounts of brand companies, with at least 226 registered
using personal email addresses.
DNS statistics. We queried Farsight Passive DNS using the
Type-1 IDNs to assess their active time and query volume.
The results are illustrated in Figure 8. Similar to homographic
IDNs, Type-1 IDNs are frequently visited, with 735 days of
active time and 1, 562 queries in average.
IDN usage. Only a few Type-1 IDNs are meaningful
to
visitors. According to our manual analysis on a sampled
set (100 websites), more than 85% are inactive, including
