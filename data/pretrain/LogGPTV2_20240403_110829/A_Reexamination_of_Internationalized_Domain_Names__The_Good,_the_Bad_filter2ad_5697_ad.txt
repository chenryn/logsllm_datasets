### Analysis of Registered Homographic IDNs

Among the 1,516 homographic IDNs, only 100 (6.6%) have been blacklisted. The registration intentions of the remaining IDNs could be legitimate (defensively registered by brand owners), malicious, or unknown (e.g., unresolved).

#### Registrants
We analyzed the registrants of these IDNs using WHOIS data for 1,111 out of 1,516 IDNs. We manually checked whether they were registered under email accounts of brand companies and found that only 73 (4.82%) were registered under this category. Among the remaining domains:
- 171 were registered by parties using personal email addresses.
- Others were registered anonymously (protected by WHOIS Privacy).

It is unlikely that brand companies are behind the anonymous registrations.

#### Brand Domains
We clustered the IDNs by their corresponding brand domains. 255 SLDs within the Alexa Top 1k are targeted by homographic IDNs, indicating the diversity of registrations. Table XIII presents the top 10 brands ordered by the number of associated IDNs. Google, Facebook, and Amazon are the top three, which are also highly ranked by Alexa. For brand protection, we found that only Google, Amazon, and Twitter perform protective registrations, but most of the IDNs are out of their reach.

### DNS Statistics
Using Farsight Passive DNS data, we found that homographic IDNs tend to have long active times. As shown in Figure 5(a), homographic IDNs have an average of 789 active days, with 40% being active for more than 600 days. Several IDNs are used for security education (e.g., xn--fcebook-hwa.com), which could explain their long lifetimes.

Homographic IDNs also tend to receive more DNS requests. As shown in Figure 5(b), 80% of homographic IDNs receive more than 100 queries, with 10% queried over 1,000 times. The top three IDNs have received considerable query volumes (over 100,000), but all are parked (e.g., xn--instagram-5jf.com, a homograph of instagram.com).

### Usage of Homographic IDNs
To understand how homographic IDNs are used, we manually classified their websites. Our findings are consistent with prior results: only a low proportion of them are in active use. Among 100 sampled domains:
- 34 are not resolvable.
- 10 return errors.
- 16 are for sale.
- 14 are parked.
- 11 host test pages.

We identified one case of a homograph attack (xn--80aa1cn6g67a.com, mimicking alipay.com, and already blacklisted).

### Availability of Homographic IDNs
Our study investigated 1,516 registered homographic IDNs. We further explored the available space of IDN registration, i.e., how many homographic IDNs are still unregistered. High availability makes domain abuse easier. To assess availability, we replaced characters with homoglyphs to create a set of IDNs and computed SSIM Indices. IDNs with a maximum SSIM Index of over 0.95 were selected as homographic domains.

We used the UC-SimList, which is based on pixel overlap between bitmaps of characters, to find homoglyphs. Only one character was replaced at a time to reduce computation overhead.

In total, we created 128,432 new IDN domains, and 42,671 of them were homographic domains of Alexa Top 1k SLDs (with 237 registered). Figure 7 shows the number of homographic IDNs (both registered and unregistered) associated with Alexa Top 100 SLDs under .com, .net, or .org. Attackers have many choices for phishing IDNs.

To assess the likelihood of successful registration, we sampled 10 homographic IDNs (e.g., xn--eay-6xy.com and xn--sn-cxs.com) and attempted to register them through GoDaddy. All our requests were approved.

### Summary of Findings
- Most browsers have responded to the threat from homograph attacks, but not all enforce the right policies, and implementations differ. Some browsers (e.g., Firefox) remain vulnerable even after the latest fix.
- 1,516 registered homographic IDNs were detected using our SSIM-based approach. Only 4.82% were registered for brand protection. Most homographic IDNs are not yet delivering useful content, but some malicious IDNs that escape blacklists were discovered.
- From the adversary's perspective, the choices of available homographic IDNs are substantial.

### Semantic Attack

In this section, we present our study on IDNs that impersonate brand domains based on semantic similarity. We focus on Type-1 semantic attacks, which compound a brand name with non-English keywords (referred to as Type-1 IDNs).

#### Detecting Type-1 IDNs
To uncover more Type-1 IDNs, we developed an automated approach and compared the entire 1.4 million registered IDNs with brand domains (Alexa Top 1K SLDs). We removed non-ASCII characters from all IDNs and computed SSIM Indices on the rendered domain name images. We selected IDNs whose ASCII-only part is identical to a brand domain (i.e., SSIM Index equals 1.0). Our assumption is that adding non-English keywords and replacing ASCII characters with homoglyphs simultaneously would make the IDN distinguishable, reducing their chances of fooling users.

#### Registered Type-1 IDNs
In total, 1,497 IDNs were detected under this category. All blacklisted phishing IDNs (see Table IX) were also detected. We manually checked their semantic meanings to understand their intentions.

| as.com         | 634        | 2.20%           | 0                       |

**Total:**
- **Type-1 IDN Rate:** 62.2%
- **Protective Registrations:** 30

**DNS Statistics:**
We queried Farsight Passive DNS to assess the active time and query volume of Type-1 IDNs. The results are illustrated in Figure 8. Similar to homographic IDNs, Type-1 IDNs are frequently visited, with an average of 735 active days and 1,562 queries.

**IDN Usage:**
Only a few Type-1 IDNs are meaningful to visitors. According to our manual analysis of a sampled set (100 websites), more than 85% are inactive, including:

- 34 not resolvable
- 10 returning errors
- 16 for sale
- 14 parked
- 11 hosting test pages

We identified one case of a semantic attack (xn--80aa1cn6g67a.com, mimicking alipay.com, and already blacklisted).
