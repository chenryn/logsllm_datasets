This might just be #28126, but it looks like a separate problem. On 1.0.2:
    julia> using BenchmarkTools
    julia> v = fill(2.0, 50000);
    julia> v2 = vcat(v, missing);
    julia> v3 = vcat(missing, v);
    julia> @btime $v .* 3.0;
      33.105 Î¼s (2 allocations: 390.70 KiB)
    julia> @btime $v2 .* 3.0;
      1.610 ms (99498 allocations: 2.33 MiB)
    julia> @btime $v3 .* 3.0;
      3.867 ms (7 allocations: 439.77 KiB)
Apart from the 40X performance difference, two things stand out:
  * 99498 allocations for `v2`. Why?
  * Why is `v3` slower than `v2`, in spite of allocating much less?
