## MTR {#c02.xhtml#head-2-22}
My TraceRoute (MTR) is another tool that combines multiple tools into
one. MTR was originally named for Matt Kimball in 1997 and was called
Matt\'s TraceRoute.
WinMTR is a Windows application that combines the `tracert` and `ping`
commands. At the time of publication, it can be downloaded from
`www.winmtr.net`. The tool is often used for network troubleshooting. By
showing a list of routers traveled and average time and packet loss, it
allows administrators to identify issues between two routers responsible
for overall latency. This can help identify network overuse problems. In
[Lab 2.4](#c02.xhtml#c02-fea-0005){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fea-0005}, you\'ll
use MTR.

## Sysinternals {#c02.xhtml#head-2-24}
Microsoft TechNet is a treasure‐trove of all things Microsoft, including
troubleshooting, downloads, and training. From the website
`https://technet.microsoft.com`, you can find free training, libraries,
wikis, forums, and blogs. When your Microsoft workstation fails hard
with a BSOD, where do you go to look up the error codes and event IDs?
TechNet! Where do you go to find utilities to help you manage,
troubleshoot, and diagnose your Windows machines *and* applications?
TechNet!
When you visit the TechNet website, the fastest way to find the
Sysinternals suite is to just search for it in the upper‐right corner.
The Sysinternals suite bundles many smaller utilities into one big
beautiful tool. One of the best things about the Sysinternals suite is
that it is portable. [Figure
2.5](#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0005){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0005} shows the
download link. You do not have to install each tool. You can put the
entire suite of tools on a USB drive and use them from any PC.
![[**[Figure 2.5](#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0005){#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0005
role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Microsoft Sysinternals suite
download](Images/c02f005.jpg){.center width="751" height="503"}
The tools include utilities such as Process Explorer, which is a lot
like Task Manager with a ton of extra features, or Autoruns, which helps
you deal with startup processes. Another tool inside the suite is
PsExec, which is a lightweight []{#c02.xhtml#Page_25 .pagebreak
title="25" role="doc-pagebreak"}replacement for Telnet. One of my
favorite tools is Notmyfault. Seriously, that\'s the name of the tool.
You can use it to crash or handle kernel memory leaks---helpful when
troubleshooting device driver issues, which has been the cause of at
least half of my BSODs. In [Lab
2.5](#c02.xhtml#c02-fea-0006){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fea-0006}, you\'ll use
Sysinternals.

There are so many wonderful tools in this file that it can be difficult
to know where to start. The following list includes the tools that I
have used quite regularly as well as some that I may not use as much but
have been helpful in certain situations:
-   [**Process Explorer**    This tool is one of the most used utilities
    in Sysinternals. It is a simple tool, but it can clue you in on
    every process, every DLL, and every activity occurring on your PC.
    In [Figure 2.7](#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0007){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0007},
    you see processes, CPU usage, PID, and other information. One of my
    favorite features of Process Explorer is the ability to check
    processes with VirusTotal if you suspect your machine is
    compromised.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0030}
    ![[**[Figure 2.7](#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0007){#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0007
    role="doc-backlink"}:**]{.figureLabel} Sysinternals Process
    Explorer](Images/c02f007.jpg){.center width="750" height="566"}
-   [**PsList**    One way to see processes on a machine is to press
    Ctrl+Alt+Delete on your keyboard and navigate to your Task Manager.
    The Task Manager is a great tool but works only on the local
    machine. You can run PsList remotely to get a list of processes
    running on someone else\'s machine.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0031}
-   [**PsKill**    This tool can be used to kill or terminate processes
    running on either your machine or someone else\'s machine. Find the
    process ID with PsList and terminate it with
    PsKill.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0032}
-   [[]{#c02.xhtml#Page_27 .pagebreak title="27"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}**Autoruns**    Malware is the bane of our IT
    existence. It can be insidious and invade the startup folder. It
    will be one the hardest things you will ever try to clean. Autoruns
    can help by looking through all possible locations where
    applications are listed to autostart. You can filter Autoruns so
    that the good things you need to start are not listed, and you can
    concentrate on the number of things that invade a
    system.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0033}
-   [**ZoomIt**    This utility can be used to magnify a certain area of
    the screen. It can integrate with PowerPoint so that during a
    presentation you can trigger certain functions with macro keys. You
    can live zoom, draw, type, and even configure a break timer if your
    audience requires one during a class.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0034}
-   [**PsLoggedOn**    This tool can find users who are logged on to a
    system. PsLoggedOn uses a scan of the registry to look through the
    HKEY_USERS key to see what profiles are loaded. This can be
    extremely helpful when you need to know who has a session
    established on a PC.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0035}
-   [**SDelete**    This is a tool that you should not need often but
    could definitely come in handy. If you ever need to delete something
    permanently so that even the best of the best file recovery tools
    cannot retrieve the data, SDelete will take the sectors where the
    file is stored and write over them []{#c02.xhtml#Page_28 .pagebreak
    title="28" role="doc-pagebreak"}with 0s. If you are ever in need of
    a permanent disposal of a file or folder, you will want to use this
    tool.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0036}
-   [**PsExec**    There will be times that you will want to execute
    programs on remote systems. Telnet runs on port 23 and sends
    credentials over a network in the clear. PsExec is a much better
    choice, allowing you to execute processes without having to manually
    install other software. You can launch interactive command prompts
    and enable remote tools.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0037}
-   [**Notmyfault**    If you have a server that is not performing as it
    should or you are seeing out‐of‐resources errors and the machine is
    very slow, you can use Notmyfault to troubleshoot more advanced
    operating system performance issues and application or process
    crashes.]{#c02.xhtml#c02-li-0038}

## The Legendary God Mode {#c02.xhtml#head-2-26}
My first experience with invulnerability came in 1993 when I started
playing *Doom*. *Doom* was a first‐person shooter game that was divided
up into nine level episodes. You played a character nicknamed DoomGuy
who was a space marine who finds himself in Hell. There was a particular
IDBEHOLDV cheat that made you invulnerable. This was considered God
mode.
In 2007, with the debut of Windows 7 came a tool that was nicknamed *God
mode*. Its real name is Windows Master Control Panel, although I
personally think God mode sounds more epic.
Windows Master Control Panel gives you access to all the operating
systems control panels within one folder. You can enable God mode in
Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 as well. The feature is useful for those in
IT, those who manage a computer, and advanced Windows experts. Enabling
God mode creates a folder that gives you access to every single Windows
OS setting. The icon you see in [Figure
2.8](#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0008){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0008} is for the
folder that gets created.
![[**[Figure 2.8](#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fig-0008){#c02.xhtml#c02-fig-0008

In [Lab 2.6](#c02.xhtml#c02-fea-0007){#c02.xhtml#R_c02-fea-0007},
you\'ll enable Windows Master Control Panel.[]{#c02.xhtml#Page_29
