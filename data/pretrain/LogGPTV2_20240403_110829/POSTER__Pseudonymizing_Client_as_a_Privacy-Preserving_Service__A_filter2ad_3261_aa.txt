## Abstract
Many Internet applications tailor their services based on the client's identifier. However, explicitly exposing this identifier to the application can raise significant privacy concerns. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving service that pseudonymizes the client's identifier. By replacing the real identifier with a pseudonym when interacting with Internet applications, the client's privacy is preserved. Additionally, delegating sender-sensitive optimization tasks to a trusted third party ensures the performance of these applications. This paper presents the use of a pseudonymizing-client service in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to enhance both performance and privacy for the client's IP address.

## 1. Introduction
Modern Internet applications frequently rely on one or more identifiers of clients to determine and deliver optimal services. These identifiers, such as IP addresses, often encode a wealth of information about the client. While this information can be useful for tailoring services, it also poses a risk of privacy breaches if revealed to the applications or intermediate systems. The dilemma is that increasing privacy protection for client identifiers may result in suboptimal performance, as the applications would have less information about the client.

A good example of this trade-off is DNS-based Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). CDNs replicate content across geographically distributed servers and redirect clients to the nearest replica to minimize web access delay. DNS is commonly used to support CDN server selection. When a client performs a DNS lookup, the authoritative DNS server returns the IP address of the optimal replica server. Ideally, the DNS should map the client’s IP address to the nearest replica. However, since clients typically use recursive resolvers, the authoritative servers only see the resolver's IP address, not the client's.

For DNS-based CDN services, there are three practical options:
1. **Local Recursive Resolver**: The local resolver is close to the client, allowing the authoritative server to make an informed decision. However, the CDN provider can still approximate the client’s IP address, raising privacy concerns.
2. **Remote DNS Resolver**: Using a remote resolver, such as OpenDNS or Google DNS, hides the client’s IP address from the authoritative server. This improves privacy but may lead to suboptimal server selection due to location mismatch.
3. **Remote DNS Resolver with EDNS-Client-Subnet**: This extension includes the client’s IP address in DNS requests, improving the mapping but potentially leaking more information than using a local resolver.

Since existing solutions do not adequately address both performance and privacy, we propose a privacy-preserving service that pseudonymizes the client’s identifier. This service is demonstrated in the context of CDNs, where it enhances both performance and privacy.

## 2. Proposed Solution
### 2.1. Overview
Our proposed solution involves a privacy-preserving service that pseudonymizes the client's identifier. This service delegates sender-sensitive optimization tasks to a trusted third party, ensuring both privacy and performance. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Client Request**: The client sends a request containing a pseudonymous identifier (PI) instead of the original identifier (OI).
2. **Pseudonymizing Registration**: The client registers the PI and OI with a trusted Pseudonymizing Registrar (PR).
3. **Optimization Query**: The CDN provider queries the PR for the optimized answer using the PI.
4. **Resolution and Optimization**: The PR translates the PI into the OI and performs the necessary optimizations.
5. **Response Forwarding**: The optimal response is forwarded back to the client.

### 2.2. Components
- **Pseudonymous Identifier (PI)**: The PI should be chosen to reveal minimal information about the client. It should be sufficiently secret and unpredictable to prevent adversaries from guessing. For example, the PI could be a pseudo-random function of the client’s IP address and a secret known only to the client.
- **Pseudonymizing Registration**: The registration record includes the OI, PI, and validity time. The client can add, change, or revoke records through secure transactions.
- **Client**: Before using the service, the client generates a PI, registers it with the PR, and includes it in requests. The PI should have a limited validity period and be periodically updated.
- **Pseudonymizing Registrar (PR)**: The PR handles registration requests, stores records, and ensures promptness, stability, and resilience. It provides a trustworthy guarantee of protecting registrants' privacy.

By isolating OI-contained messages and processes from Internet application providers and eavesdroppers, the privacy of the client's identifier is better preserved. Simultaneously, the cost of performance degradation is minimized through pseudonymous optimization.

## 3. Conclusion
This paper proposes a privacy-preserving service that pseudonymizes client identifiers, enhancing both privacy and performance in CDNs. By using a trusted third party to handle optimization tasks, the service ensures that client information remains protected while maintaining optimal service delivery.
