Advantages
• LiT hides within the limits of MT, as MT models change,
so can our system
• The generation problem is avoided by mimicking the
results of an imperfect transformation, not correct,
human-produced text
• Secret
key
(implementation,
training
corpora
and
conﬁguration) allows for many encoders
• Cover text can be public and obtained from public
sources

Disadvantages
• low bitrate (log2 n bits per sentence for n translations)
• need to transmit both source text (or a reference to it)
and translation

Increasing the Bitrate
The bitrate can be increased by:
• implementing more MT systems
• creating
new
corpora
to
train
existing
MT
implementations
• performing additional, plausible modiﬁcations (pre- and
post-passes) to the translation system in order to obtain
additional variants

Experimental Results: Bitrate
• Bitrate is for a prototype
– Limited dictionaries
– No build-in knowledge about grammar or semantics
– Few translation engines
• Low information density of text ⇒ compression
• Highest bitrate achieved: 0.0082/0.022

Use for Watermarking (1/2)
• Read mark from marked copy only
– Original text is not available
– No reference translation is available
• LSB(Keyed Hash(sentences)) = mark bit
– Modify until equal to mark bit
– Diﬀerent sentences for every mark bit

Use for Watermarking (2/2)
• Which sentences?
• Key directly selects mark bits’ locations
– Simple
– Fragile
• More robust: Use of “marker” sentences
– Mark bit is in sentences that follow marker
– Secret ranking of sentences
– Lowest-ranked are markers

Attacks
An adversary could attack the protocol by:
• spotting obvious inconsistencies:
– same sentence translated in two ways
– certain mistakes made inconsistently (“foots”)
• constructing some new statistical model for languages
that all translation systems obey,
except for the
steganographic encoder.

White-box Security
• Given such a new statistical model, it is easy to modify
the steganographic encoder to become model-aware (i.e.
produce sentences consistent with the model)
• Creating
new
models
is
equivalent
to
improving
(statistical) machine translation.
• Attacking the protocol becomes an arms race in terms
of understanding (machine) translation.
Given equal
knowledge, the defender wins.
“Of course, the quality of the model inﬂuences the security of the
steganographic algorithm – if an attacker possesses a better model (...) he
is able to distinguish between stego images and steganographically unused
data.” – E. Franz and A. Schneidewind

Avoiding Transmission of the Original
• Receiver and sender agree on small constant h.
• Receiver computes keyed hash of translation, lowest h
bits say how many bits of message are in rest of hash.
• Encoding is purely statistical and unlikely to fail if h
small and number of available translations t large:

Conclusions
• Translation-based steganography is a promising new
approach for text steganography.
• The bit-rate that can be achieved is lower than that of
systems operating on binary data.
• Statistical attacks can be defeated if the underlying
statistical language model is made public.
• Machine translation is not dead.
