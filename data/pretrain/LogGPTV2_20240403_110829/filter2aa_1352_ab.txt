### Error Insertion and Transformation in Machine Translation

This section describes the processes of error insertion, error correction, semantic substitution, and other transformations that mimic legitimate machine translation (MT) systems. For more details, refer to the following link:

### Experimental Results: Translations

#### Original Text
"**In dieser Zeit soll festgestellt werden, ob die Schüler die richtige Schule gewählt haben und ob sie ihren Fähigkeiten entspricht.**"

#### Google Translation
"In this time it is to be determined whether the pupils selected the correct school and whether it corresponds to its abilities."

#### Linguatec Translation
"Whether the pupils have chosen the right school and whether it corresponds to its abilities shall be found out at this time."

#### LiT (with 8 bits hidden)
"In this time it is toward be determined whether pupils selected a correct school and whether it corresponds toward its abilities."

#### Original Text
"**Der marokkanische Film 'Windhorse' erzählt die Geschichte zweier, unterschiedlichen Generationen angehöriger Männer, die durch Marokko reisen. Auf dem Weg suchen sie nach dem Einzigen, was ihnen wichtig ist: dem Sinn des Lebens.**"

#### Google Translation
"The Moroccan film 'Windhorse' tells the history of two, different generations of belonging men, who travel by Morocco. On the way they look for the none one, which is important to them: the sense of the life."

#### Linguatec Translation
"The Moroccan film 'Windhorse' tells the story of men belonging to two, different generations who travel through Morocco. They are looking for the only one which is important to them on the way: the meaning of the life."

#### LiT (with "lit" hidden, 24 bits)
"The Moroccan film 'Windhorse' tells story from men belonging by two, different generations who travel through Morocco. They are looking for the only one which is important to them on the way: the sense of a life."

### Advantages of LiT

- **Adaptability**: LiT operates within the limits of MT models, allowing for updates as these models evolve.
- **Avoidance of Generation Problems**: By mimicking the results of imperfect transformations, LiT avoids the need to produce perfectly human-like text.
- **Secret Key**: The use of a secret key (including implementation, training corpora, and configuration) allows for multiple encoders.
- **Public Cover Text**: The cover text can be obtained from public sources, making it easily accessible.

### Disadvantages of LiT

- **Low Bitrate**: The bitrate is limited to log2 n bits per sentence for n translations.
- **Transmission Requirements**: Both the source text (or a reference to it) and the translation must be transmitted.

### Increasing the Bitrate

The bitrate can be increased by:
- Implementing more MT systems.
- Creating new corpora to train existing MT implementations.
- Performing additional, plausible modifications (pre- and post-passes) to the translation system to obtain additional variants.

### Experimental Results: Bitrate

- **Prototype Bitrate**: The prototype has a low bitrate due to limited dictionaries, no built-in knowledge about grammar or semantics, and few translation engines.
- **Text Compression**: The low information density of the text allows for compression.
- **Highest Achieved Bitrate**: The highest bitrate achieved is 0.0082/0.022.

### Use for Watermarking

#### Reading Marks from Marked Copies
- **Marked Copy Only**: The original text and reference translation are not available.
- **LSB(Keyed Hash(sentences)) = mark bit**: Modify sentences until they match the mark bit. Different sentences are used for each mark bit.

#### Selecting Sentences for Watermarking
- **Key Selection**: The key directly selects the locations of the mark bits, which is simple but fragile.
- **Marker Sentences**: More robust methods use "marker" sentences, where the mark bit is placed in sentences following the marker. A secret ranking of sentences is used, with the lowest-ranked sentences serving as markers.

### Attacks on the Protocol

An adversary could attack the protocol by:
- Spotting obvious inconsistencies, such as the same sentence translated in two ways or certain mistakes made inconsistently.
- Constructing new statistical models for languages that all translation systems obey, except for the steganographic encoder.

### White-box Security

- **Model Awareness**: Given a new statistical model, the steganographic encoder can be modified to become model-aware, producing sentences consistent with the model.
- **Arms Race**: Creating new models is equivalent to improving (statistical) machine translation. Attacking the protocol becomes an arms race in understanding (machine) translation, with the defender having an advantage if both parties have equal knowledge.

### Avoiding Transmission of the Original

- **Agreement on Constant h**: The receiver and sender agree on a small constant h.
- **Keyed Hash**: The receiver computes a keyed hash of the translation, with the lowest h bits indicating how many bits of the message are in the rest of the hash.
- **Statistical Encoding**: The encoding is purely statistical and unlikely to fail if h is small and the number of available translations t is large. The probability of failure is given by:
  \[
  \left(1 - \frac{1}{2^h} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{2^{h-1}} \frac{1}{2^i}\right)^t
  \]
- **FEC for Error Correction**: Forward Error Correction (FEC) is used to correct encoding errors.

### Conclusions

- **Promising Approach**: Translation-based steganography is a promising new approach for text steganography.
- **Lower Bitrate**: The achievable bit-rate is lower than that of systems operating on binary data.
- **Defeating Statistical Attacks**: Statistical attacks can be defeated if the underlying statistical language model is made public.
- **Machine Translation**: Machine translation remains a viable and evolving field.
