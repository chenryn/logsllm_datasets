# The Complete Amateur ID Making Operating Guide

## By Doug Farre
### For Informational Purposes Only: An Introduction and Word of Caution

I want to begin by emphasizing that the information provided in this guide should not be used for the creation of fraudulent identification cards. While real government-issued documents may be used as examples, they should only serve as a reference for designing your own identification cards. Using this information to produce fake or fraudulent IDs is illegal, and I strongly advise against it. To further dissuade you, let's review the Texas laws regarding fake IDs.

### Texas Fake ID Laws

**POSSESSION OF FAKE IDENTIFICATION**
- **Section 521.453, Transportation Code:**
  - **Under 21 Years of Age:** Class C Misdemeanor (Up to $500 Fine)
  - A person under the age of 21 commits an offense if they possess, with the intent to represent that they are 21 years of age or older, a document deceptively similar to a driver's license or personal identification certificate. The document must display the statement "NOT A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT" diagonally on both the front and back in solid red capital letters at least 1/4 inch in height.
  - The document is considered deceptively similar if a reasonable person would assume it was issued by the Department of Public Safety (DPS), another state agency, another state, or the United States.

**DELIVERY OR MANUFACTURE OF COUNTERFEIT IDENTIFICATION**
- **Section 521.456, Transportation Code:**
  - **Class C Misdemeanor (Up to $500 Fine):** Possession with the intent to use, circulate, or pass a forged or counterfeit instrument not made by the appropriate authority.
  - **Class A Misdemeanor (Up to $4,000 Fine and/or 1 Year in Jail):** Possession with the intent to sell, distribute, or deliver a forged or counterfeit instrument not made or distributed by an authorized authority.
  - **Third Degree Felony (2-10 Years in State Penitentiary):** Manufacturing or producing with the intent to sell, distribute, or deliver a forged or counterfeit instrument known not to be made by the appropriate authority.

**TAMPERING WITH GOVERNMENTAL RECORD**
- **Texas Penal Code, Section 37.10:**
  - **Felony, Third Degree:** If the governmental record is a license, certificate, permit, seal, or similar document issued by the government, another state, or the United States.

**MISREPRESENTATION OF AGE**
- **Alcoholic Beverage Code, Section 106.07:**
  - A minor commits an offense if they falsely state that they are 21 years of age or older or present any document indicating they are 21 years of age or older to a person engaged in selling or serving alcoholic beverages.

In summary, possessing a fake ID is a Class C misdemeanor, selling one is a Class A misdemeanor, and manufacturing one is a third-degree felony.

### ID Making Operating Guide

#### Part One: The Process: An Overview

We will start with a high-level overview of the process and then delve into the details in the second part. It is strongly recommended that you read the entire guide from start to finish several times before beginning the document-making process.

First, consider the purpose of your identification card manufacturing. Common reasons include:
- Producing high-security identification documents for your organization, small business, or club.

#### Step 1: Acquire/Create/Develop a Template

When creating your template, ensure that each text field can be edited individually. Here are some common eye color codes:
- Brown: BRN
- Blue: BLU
- Green: GRN
- Black: BLK
- Hazel: HZL

Some security features, such as the yellow diagonal lines on a scanned image of a real Texas driverâ€™s license, may be difficult to reproduce without specialized equipment.

#### Example Template

For the rest of the guide, I will use the template I created for Locksport International. This guide will explain how I use amateur techniques to create a high-security membership card for members of my organization.

#### Printer Templates

Along with the membership card template, you will need printer templates to print multiple cards on a single sheet. Here is a Photoshop print guide for 8 membership cards per page:

#### Magnetic Stripe

Above the first line, we have left room for a magnetic stripe for extra security and data storage. The magnetic stripe holds data on three different tracks. Each track is an allocation of space where data is stored.

#### Printing and Lamination

1. **Prepare Your Printer and Ink:**
   - Printing on Teslin (a highly porous, synthetic paper) requires specific settings. Some recommended settings are:
     - **Canon S800:**

2. **Print Both Sides:**
   - After printing the front side, reinsert the paper into the printer to print the back side. Ensure the correct orientation for desired results.

3. **Apply Hologram:**
   - Follow the hologram application process (see Part Three: Hologram).

4. **Laminate:**
   - Use 7 mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Clear Laminate Sheets for the front and 7 mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Magnetic Stripe Laminate Sheets for the back.

By following these steps, you can create high-quality, secure identification cards for your organization.
