ID Making Operating Guide
by Doug Farre
For Informational Purposes Only : An introduction and word of caution
I want to start off by saying 
that 
none 
of 
the 
information outlined in this 
guide should be used in the 
process of manufacturing 
fraudulent 
identiﬁcation 
cards. 
 Although 
real 
government 
issued 
documents may be used as 
examples, they should only 
be used as examples to 
what you may model your 
identiﬁcation 
cards 
like.  
The 
use 
the 
of 
the 
information 
in 
this 
document for the purpose 
of 
producing 
fake 
or 
fraudulent IDs would be 
criminal 
and I strongly 
advise against it.  Let’s start 
off by describing the Texas 
fake ID laws, in an attempt 
to dissuade you further. 
The following was quoted 
from http://www.smu.edu/healthcenter/

IDENTIFICATION
Section 521.453, Transportation Code
Under 21 Years of Age: Class C 
Misdemeanor (Up to $500 Fine)
A person under the age of 21 years 
commits an offense if the person 
possesses, with the intent to represent that 
the person is 21 years of age or older, a 
document that is deceptively similar to a 
driver's license or personal identification 
certificate unless the document displays 
the statement "NOT A GOVERNMENT 
DOCUMENT" diagonally...on both the 
front and back of the document in solid 
red capital letters at least 1/4 inch in 
height.
The document is deceptively similar if a 
reasonable person would assume the 
document was issued by DPS, another 
agency of this state, another state, or the 
United States.
Section 521.456 Transportation Code:
Class C Misdemeanor (Up to $500 
Fine):
A person commits an offense if the person 
possesses with the intent to use, circulate 
or passes a forged or counterfeit 
instrument that is not made by the 
appropriate authority (DPS, another 
agency of this state, another state, or the 
United Stated).
DELIVERY OR MANUFACTURE

IDENTIFICATION 
SECTION 521.456 Transportation Code:
Class A Misdemeanor (Up to $4000 
Fine, and/or 1 year in jail):
Possesses with the intent to sell, 
distribute, or deliver a forged or 
counterfeit instrument that is not made or 
distributed by an authority authorized to 
do so under a state, federal, or Canadian 
law.
Third Degree Felony (2-10 years in 
State Penitentiary):
Manufactures or produces with the intent 
to sell, distribute, or deliver a forged or 
counterfeit instrument that the person 
knows is not made by the appropriate 
authority.

GOVERNMENTAL RECORD
Texas Penal Code, Section 37.10
Felony, Third Degree:
An offense under this section is a felony 
of the third degree if it is shown on the 
trial of the offense that the governmental 
record was a license, certificate, permit, 
seal, or similar document issued by 
government, by another state, or by the 
United States.
MISREPRESENTATION OF AGE
Alcoholic Beverage Code, Section 106.07
A minor commits an offense if he falsely 
states that he is 21 years of age or older or 
presents any document that indicates he is 
21 years of age or older to a person 
engaging in selling or serving alcoholic 
beverages.
So basically you’re looking 
at a Class C for having one, 
a Class A for selling one, 
and a Third Degree felony 
for making one.

We will start with a high level overview of the process, and then go into the details in the second part. It is strongly 
suggested you read the entire guide from start to ﬁnish several times before starting on your document making 
process. At this point you have to ask yourself the purpose of your identiﬁcation manufacturing scheme.  Most 
reasons would probably fall along the lines listed below:
Produce high security identiﬁcation documents for your organization, small business, or club.
To start off the process of manufacturing your new identiﬁcation cards, your ﬁrst step will be to acquire/create/
develop a template.  Below is an example of an AAMVA approved drivers license that contains all necessary attributes 
you should consider when creating your own personalized template for your venture.

When creating your template, it will be a good idea to make it so each text ﬁeld can be edited individually. The most 
common eye color codes are as follows:

Some security features will most likely be impossible to reproduce without the proper equipment.  For instance, take a 
look at the scanned image of a real Texas driver’s license below: 
Now, if you look very closely at the portrait image you will 
see yellow diagonal lines running from the bottom left to 
the top right.  This is an important security feature that 
only emerges when the driver’s license is scanned on an 
image scanner.  This type of security will be hard to 
implement into your ID template.
In the rest of the guide, I will use the template that I 
created for the organization Locksport International.  This 
guide will explain how I use amateur techniques to create a 
high security membership card for members of my 
organization.  Here is a picture of the template I have 
created:

Along with the membership card template, you will also need a few printer templates.  You will want to create 
yourself a set of printer templates that allow you to print multiple membership cards on a single sheet; otherwise you 
will be wasting materials and time.  The following is a picture of a print guide in Photoshop.  The guides are 
measured so that exactly 8 membership cards can ﬁt on the same page.
The other print guide lets you print the backside of the membership card.

Above the ﬁrst line we have left room for a magnetic stripe for extra security and for a data application.  The magnetic 
stripe holds whatever data you choose (usually about the individual) on three different tracks.  A track is just an 
allocation of space where data is held.  If you were talking about memory for a computer, it would be like splitting 
your memory stick into 3 different sections with a permanent marker.  
Now that we have both print guides prepared for both sides of the membership cards, we are ready to start 
our ﬁrst batch.  At this point we have prepared two sets of four identical membership cards on the print guide as seen 
below.
Next you must ﬁgure out your printer and ink type.  Unfortunately it may not be as simple as you may think. You 
may have to spend many hours tinkering and testing until you have reached your desired results. Printing with Teslin 
is much different then printing with regular copy paper or photo paper.  Teslin is highly porous, synthetic paper with 
superior adhesion attributes. It’s also biodegradable. Teslin absorbs ink much more readily, and doesn’t produce a 
glossy image as you may expect.  That is why correct printer settings are critical in this application. Some 
recommended printer settings and Teslin types are recommended below (from www.brainstormidsuply.com):

For our membership cards we will be using 10mil Laser Teslin 8.5x11.  After printing the front of your identiﬁcation 
cards, you are now ready to print the reverse side.   Depending on your printer, you will have to reinsert the paper 
into the printer in the right orientation so the desired results are obtained.  This is how we accomplish this:
Once both sides have been printed you must decide how you will proceed with your hologram application. So insert 
hologram process here. (see Part Three: Hologram)
Now that you have a working hologram, it is  time to laminate!  For our membership cards, we will be using  7 m i l 
Full Sheet 8.5x11 Clear Laminate Sheets for the front of the card, and the 7mil Full Sheet 8.5x11 Magnetic stripe 
Laminate Sheets for the back of the cards.  When you put them together it will look something like this.
