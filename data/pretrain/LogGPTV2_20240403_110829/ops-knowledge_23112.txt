User: The I/O read and write of the server is the bottleneck of the system, how to optimize it?
Assistant: The following are some ways to optimize server I/O read and write: 1. Hardware upgrade: Use high-speed, large-capacity hard disk, SSD, RAID and other technologies to improve disk performance and capacity. 2. System settings optimization: optimize the I/O read and write performance of the system by adjusting some operating system parameters, such as increasing the disk cache size, disabling unnecessary services, optimizing the file system, etc. 3. Use caching technology: Use caching technology to cache a large amount of file data in memory, which can reduce the number of disk IOs. 4. Asynchronous IO technology: Using asynchronous IO technology can improve the efficiency of I/O reading and writing and reduce CPU consumption. 5. Database optimization: reduce the number of database I/O reads and writes by adjusting database configuration, index optimization and other means. 6. Load balancing: Distributing requests to different servers through load balancing technology can avoid the problem of excessive I/O pressure on a single server. 7. Use CDN: Use CDN to cache static files on CDN nodes, and obtain them directly from CDN nodes when users request them, reducing the number of server I/O reads and writes.
