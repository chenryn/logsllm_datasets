##### CONFIGURATION

##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
The following documentation states that I can pass a variable to an imported
or included task like `- import_tasks: wordpress.yml wp_user=timmy`. However,
it only works for `include_tasks` and not when I use `import_tasks`. When
using `import_tasks` in the aforementioned way, I get an exception that the
passed variable is undefined - as can also be seen in the error section below.
Like I said, the same code works if I swap `import_tasks` with `include_tasks`
Here's the document I'm referring to:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/playbooks_reuse_includes.html#including-
and-importing-task-files
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  1. Have a playbook under tasks/abc.yml that relies on a variable that's not defined in vars, like:
    - name: echo
      shell: "echo {{ my_special_var }}
  2. In your master playbook.yml, call the first task by adding this line:  
`import_tasks: tasks/abc.yml my_special_var=Hello`
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
The task is imported and the variable from the master playbook gets passed.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
`...exception type: \nexception: 'my_special_var' is
undefined`
