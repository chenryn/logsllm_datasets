User: I'm currently trying to run an R script from the command line (my end goal is to execute it as the last line of a python script).  I'm not sure what a batch file is, or how to make my R script 'executable'. Currently it is saved as a .R file.  It works when I run it from R.
How do I execute this from the windows command prompt line? Do i need to download something called Rscript.exe? Do I just save my R script as an .exe file? Please advise on the easiest way to achieve this.
R: version 3.3   python: version 3.x  os: windows
Assistant: You probably already have R, since you can already run your script.
All you have to do is find its binaries (the Rscript.exe file).
Then open windows command line ([cmd] + [R] > type in : "cmd" > [enter])
Enter the full path to R.exe, followed by the full path to your script.
