### Distribution of Packet Sizes in a Single Connection

The distribution of packet sizes from a single connection is divided into two halves: the client half and the server half. At any given point, the graphs reflect the proportion of packets from the connection that are of a particular size or smaller. As can be seen, these distributions are quite distinct. However, this distinction is not as clear for all distributions.

### Confusion Matrices for Classification

Tables 2 and 3 show confusion matrices using the Bhattacharyya and Jensen-Shannon measures to classify connections into specific classes. The label 'XX' denotes an unknown class, indicating that no majority verdict could be reached. In these matrices, rows represent known classes, columns indicate predicted classes, and the final column shows the number of instances available for classification. Matrix entries are percentages of the total number of connections of each type.

### Cumulative Probability Distributions

- **Figure 2**: Cumulative probability distribution for class ‘H’, Web browsing forwarded through an SSH tunnel.
- **Figure 3**: Cumulative probability distribution for class ‘H’ compressed, Web browsing forwarded through an SSH tunnel where SSH is performing compression prior to encrypting the tunneled data.

### Policy Compliance and Evasion

To audit compliance with a policy specifying that SSH should be used interactively, we can use the Bhattacharyya measure to classify connections into "interactive" and "everything else" categories. Table 6 shows the results of this classification, which has a reasonably low level of false positives and false negatives. Including additional statistical measures can further improve the accuracy, as shown in Table 7.

#### Table 6: Confusion Matrix - Bhattacharyya Measure (Interactive vs. Everything Else)

|   | I    | XX   | Count |
|---|------|------|-------|
| I | 96.48| 3.52 | 227   |
| XX| 5.00 | 95.00| 260   |

#### Table 7: Confusion Matrix - Bhattacharyya Measure (Additional Measures)

|   | I    | XX   | Count |
|---|------|------|-------|
| I | 97.80| 2.20 | 227   |
| XX| 1.92 | 98.08| 260   |

### Evasion Techniques

The distribution of packet sizes from an SSH connection is a critical part of the classification process. Altering this distribution can affect the classification results, potentially allowing evasion of detection.
