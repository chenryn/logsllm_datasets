ATT&CK ID:M1018
ATT&CK Technique Name:User Account Management
Configure user permissions groups and roles for access to cloud storage.[6] Implement strict Identity and Access Management (IAM) controls to prevent access to storage solutions except for the applications, users, and services that require access.[5] Ensure that temporary access tokens are issued rather than permanent credentials, especially when access is being granted to entities outside of the internal security boundary.[15]
