system.  In  other  cases,  the  PET  tools  are  tampering  with  e.g.  email  message  headers, 
exploiting design flaws in the protocol. Such methods are similar to the techniques used by 
hackers,  spammers  and  virus  programmers;  they  are  ethically  unacceptable,  and  they  can 
seriously reduce the reliability and compatibility of the IT solutions.

9.4  LACK OF STANDARDIZED PRIVACY SOLUTIONS 
Standardization of privacy features and solutions is yet to come – the current PET solutions 
are rarely interoperable (with the notable exception of P3P and EPAL, see below), because a 
common understanding  of the  concepts and requirements has not been  established. Hence, 
most of today’s Privacy Enhancing Technologies must be considered immature. 
9.5  REDESIGN OF EXISTING SYSTEMS WILL TAKE TIME 
Legacy systems are built on the assumption that secure identification of the user is required to 
provide almost any service. The principles behind the design (architecture principles) have 
typically  not  taken  privacy  requirements  into  account,  but  were  focused  on  achieving 
simplicity  and  efficiency.  To  make  existing  systems  “privacy-aware”  or  even  “privacy-
compliant”,  the  design  principles  must  be  revised,  and  central  parts  of  the  design  must  be 
reworked. The effort required to conduct such a process is considerable, and the timeframe is 
very large. 
9.6  CRITICAL SYSTEMS REQUIRE BACK DOOR FUNCTIONALITY 
Many privacy solutions aim at putting the user in control of her/his own data. However, if the 
user is temporarily or permanently unwilling or incapable of taking the appropriate decisions, 
both  sensible  defaults  and  emergency  “back-doors”  must  be  available.  This  raises  the 
question:  Who  should  guard  the  back  doors  –  and  who  should  have  the  authority  to  take 
decisions on behalf of the user in emergency situations? 
9.7  POOR UNDERSTANDING OF PRIVACY ISSUES 
The most significant problem for the adoption of Privacy Enhancing Technologies is the poor 
understanding of privacy issues in the general public. Without this understanding, there is no 
demand for PETs, and no real drivers for the evolution of privacy solutions. Many users have 
no perception of the value of privacy, because they have not experienced the consequences of 
loosing it. As an example, many persons willingly give up secret passwords for a small bonus 
or gift. 
In  Denmark  –  and  many  other  European  countries  –  the  citizens  have  a  high  trust  in  the 
authorities, and see little need for controlling the government’s access to their private data. 
However, there is a growing awareness of guarding private information when dealing with 
private  companies,  and  still  more  citizens  will  expect  to  be  informed  of  how  their  private 
information can be used by a company, delivering services and products. 
9.8  PRIVACY REQUIRES USER TRUST 
Before the user can use PETs, he must establish trust in the technology, and/or the service. 
This means that the users must also trust the party that offers the technology. Such a trust is 
hard to establish, for a user that does not know the technology, and who does not have a clear 
understanding of the privacy risks. The lack of conceptual knowledge can seriously hamper 
the adoption of any new technology, as we have seen before, e.g. with the introduction of the 
Danish Citizen’s Card (Borgerkort).

9.9  CLASSIFICATION OF PRIVATE DATA REQUIRES NEW CONCEPTS 
It is important to recognize, that “data in context” can be sensitive, even if the same data out 
of context is not. This means that the privacy value (or threat) of a given data instance cannot 
be defined by classification of the data alone – it must be related to the situation. 
9.10  LEGISLATION NEEDS CLEAR REQUIREMENTS 
Establishing legal requirements for PET in specific situations is difficult without a systematic 
approach – additional research in this field is required, before the privacy requirements can 
be defined precisely and consistently, so that they that can form basis for legislation. Further 
complicating  is  the  fact  that  private  data  easily  crosses  borders,  whereas  legislation,  even 
within Europe, is still struggling with an easy way of handling cross-border privacy concerns. 
9.11  PRIVACY IS NOT ALWAYS THE FIRST PRIORITY 
In a number of situations, the average user will accept loss of control over his private data – 
or even loss of privacy. Examples of this could be a patient opening his medical records to a 
doctor, when he is about to receive life saving treatment on a hospital. Or accepting video 
surveillance, personal search or other violations of privacy in order to minimize the risk of 
terror  attacks.  Hence,  the  requirements  for  privacy  must  always  be  balanced  against  other 
vital needs.

10  VALUABLE INITIATIVES  
10.1  PLATFORM FOR PRIVACY PREFERENCES (P3P) PROJECT 
http://www.w3.org/P3P/
P3P  is  a  specification  developed  by  the  World  Wide  Web  Consortium  (W3C).  That 
specification, when implemented in Web sites and browsers, brings a measure of ease and 
regularity to Web users  wishing to decide when and under  what circumstances to disclose 
personal information.  
On a P3P enabled Web site, a company's privacy policy is translated into a machine-readable 
format  (Extensible  Markup  Language,  XML).  On  the  user  side,  a  P3P  client  can 
automatically fetch and read P3P privacy policies on Web sites. A user's browser equipped 
for P3P can check a Web site's privacy policy and inform the user of that site's information 
practices.  The  browser  could  then  automatically  compare  the  statement  to  the  privacy 
preferences of the user, self-regulatory guidelines, or a variety of legal standards from around 
the world. P3P client software can be built into a Web browser, plug-ins, or other software. 
Such  an  implementation  does  not  offer  privacy  protection,  but  it  can  greatly  advance 
transparency and be used to support efforts to improve privacy protection. However, for P3P 
to be widely adopted, consumer interest will have to increase, so service providers can see an 
incentive to invest the effort. 
10.2  PRIVACY ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY TESTING & EVALUATION PROJECT (PETTEP) 
http://www.ipc.on.ca/
Formed  by  the  Ontario  Office  of  the  Information  &  Privacy  Commissioner,  the  Privacy 
Enhancing Technology Testing & Evaluation Project (PETTEP) is a global team of privacy 
and data protection experts from government and private sector organizations, committed to 
developing internationally accepted testing and evaluation criteria for the privacy protecting 
functions of information systems. 
The group is collecting and structuring Fair Information Practices (FIPs) and mapping them 
to the Common Criteria (CC) framework. The effort is focused on creating a framework for 
formal evaluation, but could also be high-level principles for the design of privacy solutions.  
The  group  is  proposing  that  ISO  establishes  a  Standards  Committee  for  Privacy,  and  is 
aiming to develop a common definition for Privacy and a common set of FIPs as input into 
multipart ISO standard. 
The  reports  from  the  group  are  publicly  available,  and  the  national  privacy  work  in  the 
countries is worth noting – illustrating both the advantage of a consistent framework and the 
difficulties with aligning it with local legislation.

10.3  ENTERPRISE PRIVACY AUTHORIZATION LANGUAGE (EPAL) 
http://www.zurich.ibm.com/csc/
Developed by the IBM Privacy Research Institute, EPAL is a formal language for defining 
enterprise privacy practices. Enterprises promise a certain level of privacy to its customers 
using privacy statements or the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P). The EPAL language 
can then be used to formalize these promises. By automated enforcement of these enterprise-
specific privacy practices, enterprises are enabled to comply with the promises made. 
A privacy policy describes the privacy practices as well as the opt-in and opt-out choices of 
an  individual.  Policies  are  then  associated  with  all  data  collected  by  an  enterprise.  This 
"sticky policy paradigm" mandates that policy sticks to the data, travels with it, and can be 
used to decide how the data can be used. By separating application- and enterprise-dependent 
deployment information from the actual policies, E-P3P policies can be used to control the 
flow and usage of data inside and among enterprises. 
10.4  PRIVACY AND IDENTITY MANAGEMENT FOR EUROPE (PRIME) PROJECT 
http://www.prime-project.eu.org/
During  the  research  phase  of  this  study,  the  PRIME  project  was  launched.  PRIME  is  a 
European RTD Integrated Project under the FP6/IST Programme, addressing research issues 
of digital identity management and privacy in the information society. The project will last 
for  four  years,  and  is  planning  to  develop  concepts  and  products  in  the  field  of  identity 
management.  Although  the  scope  of  PRIME  is  only  a  subset  of  all  privacy  enhancing 
technologies, we expect that the project will be addressing some of the issues described in 
chapter 12 of this report.

11  FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
11.1  WHAT DRIVES MARKET DEMAND FOR PETS? 
Our  interviewees  see  different  drivers  for  the  development  and  adoption  of  Privacy 
Enhancing Technologies: 
Users of PET: 
•  Public awareness of privacy is perhaps the most important driver for PETs. 
•  Many commercial organizations see an important competitive value in PETs: It gives 
credibility and trust, when you can offer good privacy solutions to your clients. 
•  The general user’s irritation over spam and other intrusions of the private sphere will 
increasingly motivate him to use privacy enhancing tools and techniques. 
•  Companies using Customer Relations Management (CRM) systems experience that 
data quality is much better for companies with privacy policy than for those who just 
collect any customer data. 
•  Phishing attacks and privacy theft is a driving force for the general demand for PETs; 
mostly because the ultimate driver is always the danger of loosing money… 
•  Some users think that certification could help select the right PET, others suggest 
some public regulation to define when and where the use of PET is appropriate, or 
even required. 
Producers of PET: 
•  Most suppliers of privacy solutions and services recognize that the lack of public 
understanding of the privacy issues and values is an important barrier for their 
success. 
•  Suppliers are waiting for regulation by public authorities, so regulatory compliance 
will become an important driver for the adoption of PETs. 
•  Privacy Impact Assessments are gaining popularity – in some cases it is even 
demanded by governments as part of generic risk assessments – this could also lead to 
a larger demand for PETs.  
Authorities: 
•  Privacy Seals of approval (e.g. TRUSTe, BBBonline) is recognized as a major driver, 
because it makes the user decision easier, and in some cases it can be influencing 
public purchase decisions. 
•  E government initiatives could be a driving force for privacy solutions, if the 
authorities choose to include privacy functions as an option or a requirement.

11.2  HOW WILL PETS BE EVOLVING OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS? 
The following statements represent a summary of our research responses: 
Awareness of the privacy issues is clearly rising. But only a factual rise in abuse of identities 
will  motivate  citizens  to  accept  increased  public  control,  or  more  personal  involvement  in 
guarding  their  private  data.  Market  acceptance  will  be  polarized,  driven  by  different 
consumer attitudes: The majority doesn't care about privacy in their daily life, while a small 
minority will be worried, and demand/use PET. 
The recent increase in terror threats has changed the general opinion of privacy: Most people 
will  now  accept  increased  control,  sacrificing  their  privacy  for  the  purpose  of  personal 
security.  As  an  example,  video  surveillance  is  becoming  common  in  Denmark,  although  a 
special permission is required to set up a camera in any public place. Very few permissions 
are given, but the responsible Danish authority (Datatilsynet) receives only few complaints 
from the public. 
The citizens generally have high trust in the public authorities and are not expecting abuse 
from  this  side.  Today’s  public  administrative  systems  are  not  including  much  privacy 
protecting functionality, but the law requires the administrative staff to follow procedures that 
protect the citizen’s privacy. Unfortunately, most E-Government initiatives follow this trend, 
by not including privacy principles in their basic design criteria.  Privacy-aware design (of 
data, applications and procedures) is key to obtaining privacy, but very few examples of such 
solutions have been seen. 
Many  industries  already  use  PETs,  especially  when  more  parties  have  to  share  some  data, 
while  other  data  must  be  kept  separate.  An  example  of  this  is  when  pharmaceutical 
companies are conducting clinical testing or joint research projects. The PETs used in such 
cases will often be embedded in custom-built solutions, rather than being added to a standard 
system. It is expected that tomorrow’s privacy solutions will be an integrated part of public 
and  private  administrative  solutions,  based  on  an  architecture,  where  privacy  has  been  an 
integral part of the design criteria. 
11.3  WHICH CATEGORIES OF PETS WILL HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT? 
Our research indicates, that a natural first step towards better protection of privacy would be 
to support and encourage the use of the informational privacy tools to create and implement 
privacy  policies  on  public  and  private  web  sites.  This  could  create  the  required  broad 
awareness of privacy issues, and lead the way for more operational privacy solutions. 
Secondly, introducing common principles for identity management – with integrated privacy 
features  –  could  support  the  introduction  of  privacy  management  tools  in  selected  areas, 
where the user perceives a benefit from simplified data access and control procedures. 
Privacy frameworks, offering a suite of user oriented privacy tools, are likely to gain some 
acceptance in communities with a high level of privacy awareness, but it must be expected 
that such PET tools will be included in standard software packages over time, if the users find 
them relevant and useful.  
It is expected, that companies delivering Internet shopping and other electronic services will 
respond  to  the  customer’s  need  for  privacy,  by  offering  appropriate  functionality,  such  as 
Page 33 
Privacy Enhancing Technologies
META Group Report v 1.1

customer anonymity, when the customer prefers it. However, third party anonymizer services 
are not expected to gain significant popularity, since only few users will be willing to pay a 
third party for a service, that is already available in the shop.  
11.4  WHO WILL PROVIDE THE PET SOLUTIONS? 
It is often argued, that privacy tools must be delivered from an independent third party, in 
order  to  establish  user  trust  in  the  privacy  enhancing  product  or  service.  However,  as  the 
technology matures and the users’ understanding of the issues improves, PETs will become 
mainstream commodities, similar to other security related technologies. An example of this is 
: Just  a  decade  ago,  setting  up  a  firewall  was  a  complicated  expert  task,  and  the  cost  was 
considerable.  Today,  firewall 
in  many  standard  network 
components, e.g. modems and routers, and firewall functionality is an integrated part of the
