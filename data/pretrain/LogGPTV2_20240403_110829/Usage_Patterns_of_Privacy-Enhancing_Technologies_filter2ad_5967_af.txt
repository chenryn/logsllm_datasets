### 9.4 Lack of Standardized Privacy Solutions
Standardization of privacy features and solutions is still in its infancy. Current Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are rarely interoperable, with the notable exceptions of P3P and EPAL. This lack of standardization stems from the absence of a common understanding of the concepts and requirements. As a result, most current PETs can be considered immature.

### 9.5 Redesign of Existing Systems Will Take Time
Legacy systems are designed under the assumption that secure user identification is essential for service provision. These systems often prioritize simplicity and efficiency over privacy. To make these systems "privacy-aware" or "privacy-compliant," the underlying design principles must be revised, and significant portions of the system architecture must be reworked. This process is both time-consuming and resource-intensive.

### 9.6 Critical Systems Require Backdoor Functionality
Many privacy solutions aim to give users control over their data. However, if a user is temporarily or permanently unable to make appropriate decisions, there must be sensible defaults and emergency backdoors available. This raises the question: Who should have the authority to manage these backdoors and make decisions on behalf of the user in emergency situations?

### 9.7 Poor Understanding of Privacy Issues
The most significant barrier to the adoption of PETs is the general public's poor understanding of privacy issues. Without this understanding, there is no demand for PETs, and no real drivers for the evolution of privacy solutions. Many users do not appreciate the value of privacy because they have not experienced the consequences of losing it. For example, many people willingly trade secret passwords for small bonuses or gifts.

In Denmark and other European countries, citizens generally trust the authorities and see little need to control the government’s access to their private data. However, there is a growing awareness of the importance of protecting personal information when dealing with private companies. More citizens now expect to be informed about how their private information will be used by companies providing services and products.

### 9.8 Privacy Requires User Trust
Before users can adopt PETs, they must trust the technology and the service provider. Establishing this trust is challenging for users who are unfamiliar with the technology and do not fully understand the privacy risks. The lack of conceptual knowledge can significantly hinder the adoption of new technologies, as seen with the introduction of the Danish Citizen’s Card (Borgerkort).

### 9.9 Classification of Private Data Requires New Concepts
It is crucial to recognize that the context in which data is used can determine its sensitivity. The privacy value or threat of a given data instance cannot be defined solely by the data itself but must be related to the situation in which it is used.

### 9.10 Legislation Needs Clear Requirements
Establishing legal requirements for PETs in specific situations is difficult without a systematic approach. Additional research is needed to define privacy requirements precisely and consistently, so they can form the basis for legislation. Further complicating matters is the fact that private data easily crosses borders, while legislation, even within Europe, struggles to handle cross-border privacy concerns effectively.

### 9.11 Privacy Is Not Always the First Priority
In some situations, users may accept a loss of control over their private data or even a loss of privacy. For example, a patient might share medical records with a doctor for life-saving treatment, or accept video surveillance and personal searches to minimize the risk of terrorist attacks. Therefore, privacy requirements must always be balanced against other vital needs.

### 10 Valuable Initiatives

#### 10.1 Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project
**Website:** [http://www.w3.org/P3P/](http://www.w3.org/P3P/)

P3P is a specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). When implemented in websites and browsers, P3P brings ease and regularity to users' decisions about when and under what circumstances to disclose personal information. On a P3P-enabled website, a company's privacy policy is translated into a machine-readable format (XML). A P3P client can automatically fetch and read these policies, allowing the browser to check the site's information practices and inform the user. The browser can then compare the site's policy to the user's preferences, self-regulatory guidelines, or legal standards. P3P does not offer direct privacy protection but greatly enhances transparency and supports efforts to improve privacy protection. For P3P to be widely adopted, consumer interest must increase, providing an incentive for service providers to invest in implementation.

#### 10.2 Privacy Enhancing Technology Testing & Evaluation Project (PETTEP)
**Website:** [http://www.ipc.on.ca/](http://www.ipc.on.ca/)

Formed by the Ontario Office of the Information & Privacy Commissioner, PETTEP is a global team of privacy and data protection experts from government and private sector organizations. The project aims to develop internationally accepted testing and evaluation criteria for the privacy-protecting functions of information systems. The group is collecting and structuring Fair Information Practices (FIPs) and mapping them to the Common Criteria (CC) framework. Their efforts are focused on creating a formal evaluation framework and high-level principles for the design of privacy solutions. The group proposes that ISO establishes a Standards Committee for Privacy and aims to develop a common definition for privacy and a set of FIPs as input into a multipart ISO standard. Reports from the group are publicly available and highlight the advantages of a consistent framework and the challenges of aligning it with local legislation.

#### 10.3 Enterprise Privacy Authorization Language (EPAL)
**Website:** [http://www.zurich.ibm.com/csc/](http://www.zurich.ibm.com/csc/)

Developed by the IBM Privacy Research Institute, EPAL is a formal language for defining enterprise privacy practices. Enterprises use privacy statements or P3P to promise a certain level of privacy to their customers. EPAL can formalize these promises, enabling automated enforcement of enterprise-specific privacy practices. A privacy policy describes the privacy practices and opt-in/opt-out choices of an individual, and these policies are associated with all data collected by the enterprise. This "sticky policy paradigm" ensures that the policy travels with the data and can be used to decide how the data can be used. By separating application- and enterprise-dependent deployment information from the actual policies, E-P3P policies can control the flow and usage of data within and among enterprises.

#### 10.4 Privacy and Identity Management for Europe (PRIME) Project
**Website:** [http://www.prime-project.eu.org/](http://www.prime-project.eu.org/)

During the research phase of this study, the PRIME project was launched. PRIME is a European RTD Integrated Project under the FP6/IST Programme, focusing on digital identity management and privacy in the information society. The project, lasting four years, aims to develop concepts and products in the field of identity management. Although PRIME's scope is a subset of all PETs, it is expected to address some of the issues described in Chapter 12 of this report.

### 11 Future Perspectives

#### 11.1 What Drives Market Demand for PETs?
Our interviewees identified various drivers for the development and adoption of PETs:

- **Users of PETs:**
  - Public awareness of privacy is perhaps the most important driver.
  - Many commercial organizations see competitive value in PETs, as they enhance credibility and trust.
  - General user irritation over spam and other intrusions of privacy will increasingly motivate the use of PETs.
  - Companies using CRM systems find that data quality is better when they have a privacy policy.
  - Phishing attacks and privacy theft drive the general demand for PETs, primarily due to the financial risks.
  - Some users believe certification could help select the right PET, while others suggest public regulation to define appropriate use.

- **Producers of PETs:**
  - Most suppliers recognize that the lack of public understanding of privacy issues is a significant barrier.
  - Suppliers await public regulation to make regulatory compliance a key driver.
  - Privacy Impact Assessments are gaining popularity, sometimes mandated by governments, which could increase demand for PETs.

- **Authorities:**
  - Privacy Seals of approval (e.g., TRUSTe, BBBonline) are recognized as major drivers, making user decisions easier and influencing public purchase decisions.
  - E-government initiatives could drive privacy solutions if authorities include privacy functions as options or requirements.

#### 11.2 How Will PETs Evolve Over the Next Few Years?
Awareness of privacy issues is rising, but only a factual increase in identity abuse will motivate citizens to accept increased public control or more personal involvement in guarding their private data. Market acceptance will be polarized, driven by different consumer attitudes. While the majority may not care about privacy in daily life, a small minority will be concerned and demand/use PETs.

Recent increases in terror threats have changed the general opinion of privacy, with most people accepting increased control for personal security. For example, video surveillance is becoming common in Denmark, although special permission is required to set up cameras in public places. Despite few permissions being granted, the responsible Danish authority (Datatilsynet) receives few complaints from the public.

Citizens generally trust public authorities and do not expect abuse from this side. Today’s public administrative systems do not include much privacy-protecting functionality, but the law requires administrative staff to follow procedures that protect citizens’ privacy. Unfortunately, most E-Government initiatives do not include privacy principles in their basic design criteria. Privacy-aware design (of data, applications, and procedures) is key to achieving privacy, but few such solutions exist.

Many industries already use PETs, especially when multiple parties need to share some data while keeping other data separate. For example, pharmaceutical companies conducting clinical trials or joint research projects. PETs in such cases are often embedded in custom-built solutions rather than added to standard systems. It is expected that future privacy solutions will be integrated into public and private administrative solutions, based on an architecture where privacy is a core design criterion.

#### 11.3 Which Categories of PETs Will Have the Greatest Impact?
Our research indicates that a natural first step towards better privacy protection would be to support and encourage the use of informational privacy tools to create and implement privacy policies on public and private websites. This could create the necessary broad awareness of privacy issues and pave the way for more operational privacy solutions.

Secondly, introducing common principles for identity management with integrated privacy features could support the introduction of privacy management tools in selected areas where users perceive a benefit from simplified data access and control procedures.

Privacy frameworks offering a suite of user-oriented privacy tools are likely to gain acceptance in communities with high privacy awareness. Over time, such PET tools are expected to be included in standard software packages if users find them relevant and useful.

It is expected that companies delivering Internet shopping and other electronic services will respond to the customer’s need for privacy by offering appropriate functionality, such as customer anonymity, when preferred. However, third-party anonymizer services are not expected to gain significant popularity, as few users will be willing to pay for a service already available in the shop.

#### 11.4 Who Will Provide the PET Solutions?
It is often argued that privacy tools must be delivered by independent third parties to establish user trust. However, as the technology matures and users' understanding improves, PETs will become mainstream commodities, similar to other security-related technologies. For example, setting up a firewall was once a complicated and expensive task, but today, firewall functionality is integrated into many standard network components, such as modems and routers.
