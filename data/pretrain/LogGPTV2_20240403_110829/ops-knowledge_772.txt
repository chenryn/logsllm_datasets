User: How to perform system monitoring and performance optimization? Please provide different solutions and tools for different systems (such as physical machines, virtual machines, containers, etc.).
Assistant: 1. Physical machine system monitoring and performance optimization: Solution: (1) Use basic monitoring tools, such as top, vmstat, iostat, sar and other commands to monitor system resources. (2) Perform performance analysis based on monitoring results, such as adjusting kernel parameters, adjusting process priority, etc. for performance optimization. (3) Use network monitoring tools, such as Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic. (4) Use log monitoring tools, such as Rizhiyi for centralized management and analysis. Tools: (1) htop: a top-based monitoring tool that can be used to view processes and resource usage. (2) Nmon: Provides command line-based system performance monitoring and analysis tools. (3) glances: Provides multi-platform monitoring and supports multiple operating systems and hardware platforms. (4) sysstat: Provides basic system resource monitoring tools. 2. Virtual machine system monitoring and performance optimization: Solution: (1) Use basic virtual machine monitoring tools to monitor virtual machine performance. (2) Adjust virtual machine resource allocation and virtual machine optimization strategies. (3) Optimize the network configuration of the virtual machine, such as using a virtual network card to optimize the network of the virtual machine. (4) Perform performance analysis and optimization based on monitoring results. Tools: (1) VMware vRealize Operations: Provide monitoring and management tools for virtual machines and cloud environments, helping users adjust virtual machine configurations according to their needs. (2) Zabbix: Provides a variety of virtual machine monitoring tools to accurately monitor virtual machine resources. (3) Nagios: Provides highly scalable virtual machine monitoring, and can integrate various plug-ins and scripts for performance analysis. 3. Container system monitoring and performance optimization: Solution: (1) Use basic container monitoring tools to monitor container performance, such as viewing the running status of containers through the Docker Stats command. (2) Adjust container resource configuration and container optimization strategies. (3) Optimize container network configuration, such as container interconnection, to achieve container network optimization. (4) Perform performance analysis and optimization based on monitoring results. Tools: (1) Prometheus: Provides container monitoring and performance analysis, suitable for large-scale container deployment. (2) Kubernetes Dashboard: Provides container management and monitoring tools to accurately monitor container resources. (3) CAdvisor: Provides in-depth container performance monitoring support, which can capture more container indicators.
