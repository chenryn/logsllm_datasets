User: When I execute jupyter notebook in my virtual environment in Arch Linux, the following error occurred.
Error executing Jupyter command 'notebook': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
My Python version is 3.6, and my Jupyter version is 4.3.0
How can I resolve this issue?
Assistant: I'm trying to get this going on VirtualBox on Ubuntu.  Finally on some other post it said to try jupyter-notebook.  I tried this and it told me to do sudo apt-get jupyter-notebook and that installed a bunch of stuff.  Now if I type command jupyter-notebook, it works.
