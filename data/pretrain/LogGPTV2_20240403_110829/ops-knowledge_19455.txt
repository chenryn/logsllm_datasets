User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 too_many_index 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This function checks for the presence of too many indexes in a table, which can negatively impact the performance of insert and update operations. If the table structure is not available or the select type is not appropriate, this is not a root cause. If there are a large number of indexes in the table, the function identifies the related tables and provides details on the number of indexes. In this case, the function is a root cause and suggests that too many indexes can slow down insert, delete, and update statements. The threshold for the number of indexes is determined by the variable "index_number_threshold".

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- index_number_threshold
- len(table.index)
