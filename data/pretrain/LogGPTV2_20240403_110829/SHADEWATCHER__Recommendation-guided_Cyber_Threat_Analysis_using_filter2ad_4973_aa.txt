Abstract—System auditing provides a low-level view into cyber
threats by monitoring system entity interactions. In response
to advanced cyber-attacks, one prevalent solution is to apply
data provenance analysis on audit records to search for anoma-
lies (anomalous behaviors) or speciﬁcations of known attacks.
However, existing approaches suffer from several limitations: 1)
generating high volumes of false alarms, 2) relying on expert
knowledge, or 3) producing coarse-grained detection signals.
In this paper, we recognize the structural similarity between
threat detection in cybersecurity and recommendation in infor-
mation retrieval. By mapping security concepts of system entity
interactions to recommendation concepts of user-item interac-
tions, we identify cyber threats by predicting the preferences of a
system entity on its interactive entities. Furthermore, inspired by
the recent advances in modeling high-order connectivity via item
side information in the recommendation, we transfer the insight
to cyber threat analysis and customize an automated detection
system, SHADEWATCHER. It fulﬁlls the potential of high-order
information in audit records via graph neural networks to im-
prove detection effectiveness. Besides, we equip SHADEWATCHER
with dynamic updates towards better generalization to false
alarms. In our evaluation against both real-life and simulated
cyber-attack scenarios, SHADEWATCHER shows its advantage in
identifying threats with high precision and recall rates. Moreover,
SHADEWATCHER is capable of pinpointing threats from nearly
a million system entity interactions within seconds.
I. INTRODUCTION
There has been a rapid escalation of high-proﬁle security
threats that intentionally target large enterprises, such as the
Equifax breach that resulted in a record number of user data
stolen [1] and the Solarwinds hack whose scope and audacity
are claimed unprecedented [2]. Often termed as Advanced
Persistent Threats (APTs), they are carried out by skilled
attackers with sophisticated cyber capabilities. To combat these
threats, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
system [3]–[5] is pervasively deployed. Such software moni-
tors interactions among system entities (i.e., processes, ﬁles,
and sockets) on end hosts as audit records, which collects
evidence of attack footprints. Unfortunately, due to the ever-
expanding scale of modern IT infrastructures, the volume of
audit data is always overwhelming. For example, a typical
commercial bank with 200,000 hosts can produce almost 70
PB audit records per year [6].
To facilitate attack investigation in large-scale host records,
the research community proposes data provenance techniques
to navigate audit records through a provenance graph that
describes the history of a system’s execution [7]–[9]. The

rich contexts in provenance data enable analysts to perform
causal analysis of system activities to detect intrusions, trace
dependencies, and reason about security incidents. Threat
detection is the typical starting step of an attack investigation.
Based on how audit records are used, existing provenance-
based detectors fall into three categories: 1) Statistics-based
detection quantiﬁes the suspiciousness degree of audit records
through their rareness in provenance graphs [10]–[12]; 2)
Speciﬁcation-based detection matches audit records against a
knowledge base of security policies associated with known
attack patterns [13]–[19]; 3) Learning-based detection extends
machine learning techniques to model benign behaviors and
detect deviations from them [20]–[24].
Although existing solutions have shown promising detection
performance, they bear several inherent drawbacks. Statistics-
based detection is prone to high volumes of false alarms for
rare yet normal system activities. This is because statistical
analysis considers only direct (causal) connections in prove-
nance graphs rather than subtle (semantic) relationships among
system entities, which can be critical for threat analysis, es-
pecially when facing evolving behaviors. While speciﬁcation-
based detection can maintain low false-positive rates by deﬁn-
ing attack semantics as security policies, such heuristics are
time-consuming and error-prone to develop. According to a
recent survey, policies tied to COTS SIEM products cover
only 16% of public TTPs knowledge base [25]. Additionally,
learning-based detection aims to comprehensively incorporate
both the causality and semantics of audit records into threat
analysis. Despite the high detection accuracy, current learning
approaches produce detection signals at a coarse-grained level,
e.g., behavior level. Consequently, tedious manual labor is
required to review all audit records in individual behavior to
determine if they indicate an actual attack [26].
The fundamental challenge in analyzing cyber threats is to
conduct comprehensive yet ﬁne-grained reasoning in a large
number of audit records. Security analysts need to discern not
only whether a certain audit record is the result of an attack
but how it is associated with the malicious behavior. Threat
actors typically induce unwanted behaviors with unintended
system entity interactions deemed suspicious to analysts. In-
tuitively, intended interactions form the norm of behaviors
and constitute the most “likely” behaviors to be observed. On
the contrary, unintended behaviors deviate from the norm and
contain “unlikely” interactions to be observed. As such, cyber
threats can be revealed by determining how likely a system

entity would interact with another entity. This likelihood of
interactions can be estimated by exploiting causal connectivity
in provenance graphs. Such connectivity, however, does not
capture the hidden semantic meanings behind system entities
that are necessary to uncover their relationships. To illustrate,
consider the Linux /proc ﬁle system. As /proc/25/stat and
/proc/27/stat belong to different processes, they are typically
disconnected in provenance graphs, being treated causally ir-
relevant by direct connections. However, both of them present
status information about processes, which can be reﬂected
when considering the border contexts around them.
We notice that a similar problem has been explored in the
recommendation domain, where the primary goal is to predict
how likely a user would consume items. Earlier recommenda-
tion systems [27], [28] assume that behaviorally similar users
would share preferences on items so that they comprehend user
preferences by ﬁnding similar users through historical user-
item interactions. However, direct connections between users
and items, termed as ﬁrst-order connectivity, are insufﬁcient
to compare semantic similarities among different items. To
address this problem, researchers further take into account side
information of items, e.g., the genre of movies, for capturing
item semantics. At its core is that side information can form
high-order connectivity to link similar items disconnected in
user-item interactions [29], [30]. Based on this advancement in
recommendations, we aim to incorporate side information of
system entities to interpret their interactions comprehensively.
Although such auxiliary information is not explicitly encoded
in provenance graphs, a recent study has demonstrated that
the semantics of system entities can be revealed from the
contexts in which they are used [31]. As such, we leverage
contextual
information as the underlying side information
to proﬁle system entities. Thereafter, system entities with
similar contexts would be semantically correlated, despite
being considered irrelevant in causal analysis.
By mapping cybersecurity concepts of system entity inter-
actions and entity contextual information to recommendation
concepts of user-item interactions and item side information,
we can formulate cyber threat detection as a recommendation
task. Especially, we observe that semantically similar system
entities would exhibit similar preferences on interactions. For
example, sensitive ﬁles (e.g., /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow)
normally do not interact with public networks, which other-
wise indicates data exﬁltration [32]. Based on this observation,
threat detection can be further speciﬁed as predicting how
likely a system entity would not “prefer” its interactive enti-
ties. Note that in contrast to typical recommendation scenarios
studying user preferences, threat detection targets interactions
that system entities unlikely prefer, as such interactions are
commonly strong attack indicators.
In this paper, we present SHADEWATCHER, the ﬁrst sys-
tem that analyzes cyber threats through recommendations on
system entity interactions. SHADEWATCHER extracts side in-
formation of system entities using a context-aware embedding
model [33] that unfolds the semantics of entities by their
usage in a running system. To unveil system entity intents
on interactions, SHADEWATCHER employs a recommendation
model built upon graph neural networks [34] that exploits
high-order connectivity by recursively propagating informa-
tion from neighboring entities. Furthermore, SHADEWATCHER
dynamically updates its models with analyst feedback on
detection signals (i.e., potentially malicious interactions). This
allows SHADEWATCHER to integrate false recommendations
as additional supervision to improve its detection capabil-
ities. As a semi-supervised approach, SHADEWATCHER is
trained on a combination of unlabeled benign system entity
interactions with labeled analyst feedback on false alarms.
In a nutshell, SHADEWATCHER’s novel utilization of recom-
mendations makes it advantageous to existing detectors in
that: 1) instead of counting historical frequency as a metric
to estimate degrees of suspicion, SHADEWATCHER infers
intrinsic semantics of system entities to discover anomalous
interactions; 2) SHADEWATCHER provides an end-to-end so-
lution to detect threats without prior knowledge of attacks; 3)
SHADEWATCHER produces ﬁne-grained detection signals that
highlight the key indicator of an attack.
We implement SHADEWATCHER and evaluate its effective-
ness and efﬁciency on four APT attacks generated by the
TRACE team in the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC)
program [35] and six cyber-attacks from recent literature [6],
[31], [36] simulated in a testbed environment. Experimental
results show that SHADEWATCHER effectively differentiates
benign and malicious system entity interactions and detects
cyber threats with high precision and recall rates. We also
demonstrate that SHADEWATCHER is efﬁcient enough to scale
to an enterprise environment.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We identify the task similarity between threat detection and
recommendation. Establishing a mapping between these
two domains is the key novelty of our approach, which
opens up a new space for effective solutions in cyber threat
analysis. Moreover, we recognize the concept of high-order
information in audit records for modeling preferences of
system entities on their interactive entities.
• We present SHADEWATCHER, the ﬁrst system designed
after the principle of recommendations, to analyze cyber
threats using audit records in an automated and adaptive
manner while providing appropriate abstractions highlight-
ing key attack indicators.
• We implement SHADEWATCHER and conduct a systematic
