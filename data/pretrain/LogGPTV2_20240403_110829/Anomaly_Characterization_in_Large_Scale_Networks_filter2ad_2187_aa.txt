## Abstract
This work addresses the online characterization of errors in large-scale systems. Specifically, we aim to distinguish between massive errors, which impact a large number of nodes, and isolated errors, which affect only a few or even a single node. The theoretical aspect of this problem involves characterizing errors based on their neighborhood. We show that there are scenarios where isolated and massive errors are indistinguishable from an omniscient observer's perspective. To address this, we introduce the concept of unresolved configurations and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for any node to determine the type of error it has experienced. These conditions are locally computable, depending only on the immediate neighborhood of each node. We present algorithms that implement these conditions and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations. From a practical standpoint, distinguishing between isolated and massive errors is crucial for network providers. For example, Internet service providers managing millions of home gateways need procedures that allow gateways to self-determine whether their dysfunction is due to network-level errors or local hardware/software issues, and to notify the service provider only in the latter case.

## 1. Introduction
In this paper, we study the online monitoring problem in large-scale distributed systems. This problem involves continuously collecting and analyzing relevant information from monitored devices to maintain awareness of the system's state. In scenarios with a large number of devices, such as those managed by Internet service providers, traditional approaches like customer care call centers are often used. However, these methods have several drawbacks, including unpredictable detection latency, high costs, and inefficiency. Automated monitoring procedures are needed to notify service providers only for legitimate reasons. Standardized procedures exist at the device level to trigger investigations in the presence of errors or network events, but they are rarely used in practice due to potential overloading of the service operator. It is essential to minimize the pressure on the service operator by enabling each device to locally detect whether its quality of service (QoS) degradation is also observed by other devices. Our solution provides each end-device the capability to distinguish between network-based events and local ones, ensuring that only network events are reported to the over-the-top operators.

## 2. Related Work
Several existing techniques focus on continuous and automatic monitoring of time-varying metrics in large-scale systems. Some approaches exploit temporal and spatial correlations among groups of monitored nodes to reduce communication costs. For example, [15] uses Kalman filters to predict metric values and clusters nodes based on their similarity. However, these approaches often suffer from centralized clustering processes, which limit scalability. Other works, such as [2], leverage structured peer-to-peer architectures to ensure scalable monitoring. In contrast, our approach provides close end-devices the ability to locally exploit correlations to detect the type of error they have experienced.

## 3. System Model
This section introduces the terminology and concepts used to model the impact of outages on monitored devices. We consider a set of \( n \) monitored devices, each consuming a subset of \( d \) services. At any discrete time \( k \), the QoS of each consumed service \( s_i \) at device \( j \) is measured using an end-to-end performance measurement function \( q_{i,k}(j) \), with values in the range [0, 1]. The QoS of monitored devices at time \( k \) is modeled as a set \( S_k \) of \( n \) points in a QoS space \( E = [0, 1]^d \). The state of the system at time \( k \) is \( S_k = (p_k(1), \ldots, p_k(n)) \), where \( p_k(j) = (q_{1,k}(j), \ldots, q_{d,k}(j)) \).

Each device \( j \) has access to an error detection function \( a_k(j) \) that returns true if the QoS variation is too large to be considered normal. Different error detection functions, ranging from simple threshold-based methods to more sophisticated ones like Holt-Winters forecasting or Cusum methods, can be used. We assume that if a set of devices with similar QoS at time \( k-1 \) are impacted by the same error, their positions in \( E \) at time \( k \) will still be close. This closeness is modeled by the presence of points within a ball of radius \( r \), called the consistency impact radius.

### 3.1 Terminology and Notations
We use the uniform norm \( \| \cdot \| \) defined for any \( x = (x_1, \ldots, x_d) \in E \) by \( \|x\| = \max\{x_1, \ldots, x_d\} \). All norms are equivalent in finite-dimensional spaces, so our results hold for any norm.

**Definition 1 (r-consistent set):** A subset \( B \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\} \) is said to be \( r \)-consistent at time \( k \) if the maximal distance between any \( i, j \in B \) is not larger than \( 2r \):
\[ \forall (i, j) \in B^2, \|p_k(i) - p_k(j)\| \leq 2r. \]

**Definition 2 (Maximal r-consistent set):** A subset \( B \) is a maximal \( r \)-consistent set if it is \( r \)-consistent and no larger subset containing \( B \) is \( r \)-consistent.

## 4. Problem Formalization
The on-line anomaly detection problem is formalized as follows: Given two successive configurations of the system, can we distinguish between massive and isolated errors? We introduce the concept of unresolved configurations and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for any node to determine the type of error it has experienced. These conditions are locally computable and depend only on the immediate neighborhood of each node.

## 5. Local Conditions and Algorithms
We present computable conditions that allow any device to locally solve the relaxed version of the anomaly detection problem. These conditions are derived from the properties of \( r \)-consistent sets and the local neighborhood of each node. We design local algorithms that implement these conditions and analyze their performance through extensive simulations.

## 6. Simulation Results
Our simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in distinguishing between isolated and massive errors. The results show that the algorithms achieve high accuracy, comparable to that of an omniscient observer, while maintaining low computational overhead.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, we have presented a method for online anomaly characterization in large-scale networks. Our approach enables each device to locally determine the type of error it has experienced, thereby reducing the overall pressure on the service operator. Future work will focus on extending the model to handle more complex error scenarios and improving the efficiency of the algorithms.
