When you navigate to the Preferences and open the Install page, entering a search term in the provided form will generate a list of relevant packages. The titles of these packages are displayed as hyperlinks; however, clicking on the titles of uninstalled packages does not trigger any action. Ideally, such an interaction should either lead to a detailed page about the package or, at the very least, open the package's page on atom.io in a new browser window. In contrast, clicking on the title of an installed package directs you to an Atom-specific page that offers more information about the package.

This observation pertains to Atom version 0.170.0 on macOS.
