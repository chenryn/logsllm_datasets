If you go to preferences, open the Install page, enter something into the
search form, then a list of packages will show up. Their titles will be styled
as links, but clicking on the titles of uninstalled packages does nothing.
(I'd expect it to go to a page about that package, or at least open the
package's page on atom.io in a browser window.) Clicking the title of an
installed package brings you to an atom page for the package that gives you
more info about the package.
