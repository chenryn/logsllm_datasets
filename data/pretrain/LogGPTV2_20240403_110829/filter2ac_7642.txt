title:botconf2016 Advanced Incident Detection and Threat Hunting using Sysmon (and Splunk)
Enterprises and organizations of all sizes are struggling to prevent and detect all malware attacks and advanced adversary actions inside their networks in a timely manner. Prevention focused technology hasn’t been good enough to prevent breaches for years and detection has been lacking in many ways. This presentation will give an overview and detailed examples on how to use the free Sysinternals tool SYSMON to greatly improve host-based incident detection and enable threat hunting approaches. Splunk is just an example of a SIEM to centralize Sysmon log data and be able to search and correlate large amounts of data to create high-quality alerts with low false-positive rates. The same could likely be done using another free or commercial SIEM.  The main goal is to share an approach, a methodology how to greatly improve host-based detection by using Sysmon and Splunk to create alerts. One main topic throughout the presentation will be how to find suspicious or malicious behaviors, how to implement search queries and how to reduce or eliminate false-positives. Examples will cover different crimeware malware families as well as tools and TTPs used by Red Teams and advanced adversaries.  For the latter, a commercial tool (Cobalt Strike) was used to test different privilege escalation and lateral movement techniques and develop queries for detection. Sysinternals Process Monitor and Sysmon tools were used to analyze behaviors on the endpoints involved.  Any Blue Team member should be able to take away some ideas and approaches to improve detection and incident response readiness in their organization.
