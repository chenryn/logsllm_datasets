Question: In the context of OAuth 2.0, when developing a mobile banking application that requires secure interaction with the bank's own services, which user agent implementation method is deemed more appropriate, and why?
"A": "Using an external user agent, as it allows the app to control the browser behavior including certificate pinning.",
"B": "Using an embedded user agent, as it keeps the authentication process within the app, reducing the risk of credential phishing.",
"C": "Using an external user agent, because it requires complex authentication logic, which provides better security.",
"D": "Using an embedded user agent, because it exposes the user's credentials to the app during login, enhancing the security."
Answer: B
