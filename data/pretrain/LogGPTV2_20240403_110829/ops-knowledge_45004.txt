User: How to use Nginx as a reverse proxy server to balance load among multiple physical servers?
Assistant: To use Nginx as a reverse proxy server for load balancing, you need to complete the following steps: 1. Install Nginx: You can use the package manager to install or manually compile and install. 2. Configure Nginx: Edit the Nginx configuration file nginx.conf, add the upstream block, which contains the addresses and ports of multiple servers. For example: ``` upstream backend { server backend1.example.com:8080; server backend2.example.com:8080; server backend3.example.com:8080; } ``` This configuration will distribute traffic to Three servers. 3. Configure the reverse proxy: add the server block in the http block, configure the listening port and domain name, and set the location block to proxy requests to the server cluster configured in the upstream block. For example: ``` http { ... server { listen 80; server_name example.com; location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } } } ``` 4. Test the reverse proxy: access the configured domain name in the browser, confirm that you are accessing a server in the server cluster, and then refresh it several times to confirm that the traffic is polled and allocated to different on the server. 5. Deploy multiple physical servers: Install and configure the same software and environment on multiple physical servers, and add them to the upstream block. 6. Improve load balancing efficiency: More advanced load balancing algorithms can be used, such as IP hash, weight, minimum number of connections, etc.
