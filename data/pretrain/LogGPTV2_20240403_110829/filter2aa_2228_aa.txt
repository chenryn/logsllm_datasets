Approaching the DRM
Possible Strategies (1)
Ultimate Goal
Find code for content decryption and the associated key setup
Obvious Approach
1
BPs on ﬁle I/O APIs (CreateFile, ReadFile, MMF)
2
Set BPM on ﬁlebuffer
either stops on copy operation
or breaks on decryption

Possible Strategies (2)
Code Coverage
Runtime analysis to spot relevant code by recording execution
of basic blocks / functions
Code Coverage Limitation
Here: Impossible to ﬁnd DRM code itself using code
coverage!
Gives some good starting points, though

Exception Dispatching
Windows SEH
Structured Exception Handling
Dispatch exception on a per-thread-basis
Linked list of handlers starting at fs:[0]
On exception OS walks list of faulting thread
When called, a handler can:
Handle exception and ask OS to continue execution
Refuse to handle exception

Remarks
SEH Handler Invocation
Simpliﬁed view, because
No stack unwinding
No collided unwind, nested exceptions
Handler can decide not to return (C++, try...except)
But good enough for our analysis!

Trampolines Overview
Trampoline Deﬁnition
Copy code at runtime to randomized location (RDTSC),
execute from there
Trampoline Execution
1
Change control ﬂow via fake exceptions (single step
exception)
2
Exception handler modiﬁes EIP based on debug register
values
3
Execution resumes at next trampoline

Trampoline Details
Trampoline Control Flow
Trampoline A transfers control ﬂow to trampoline B
Control ﬂow entirely depends on jumps and exceptions
No call or ret instructions, no direct control ﬂow
between trampolines
Therefore, a call hierarchy emulation is implemented

Call Stack Emulation
The ret instruction is emulated by a similar mechanism!
Special exception handler removes trampoline from
internal call stack
Modiﬁes context, execution resumes

More Trampoline Details
Use of the Debug Registers
DR0 and DR6 are zeroed out
DR1 contains pointer to a shared stack area to pass data
between trampolines
DR2 holds trampoline address, which is used to perform
return emulation
DR3 holds the address of the starting trampoline
(trampoline0)
DR7 is used to turn hardware breakpoints on and very
frequently
