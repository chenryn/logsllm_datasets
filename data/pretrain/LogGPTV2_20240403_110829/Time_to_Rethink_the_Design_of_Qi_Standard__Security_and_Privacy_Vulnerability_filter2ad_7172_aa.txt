ABSTRACT
With the ever-growing deployment of Qi wireless charging for
mobile devices, the potential impact of its vulnerabilities is an in-
creasing concern. In this paper, we conduct the first thorough study
to explore its potential security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to
the open propagation property of electromagnetic signals as well
as the non-encrypted Qi communication channel, we demonstrate
that the Qi communication established between the charger (i.e., a
charging pad) and the charging device (i.e., a smartphone) could be
non-intrusively interfered with and eavesdropped. In particular, we
build two types of attacks: 1) Hijacking Attack: through stealthily
placing an ultra-thin adversarial coil on the wireless charger’s sur-
face, we show that an adversary is capable of hijacking the com-
munication channel via injecting malicious Qi messages to further
control the entire charging process as they desire; and 2) Eavesdrop-
ping Attack: by sticking an adversarial coil underneath the surface
(e.g., a table) on which the charger is placed, the adversary can eaves-
drop Qi messages and further infer the device’s running activities
while it is being charged. We validate these proof-of-concept attacks
using multiple commodity smartphones and 14 commonly used
calling and messaging apps. The results show that our designed hi-
jacking attack can cause overcharging, undercharging, and paused
charging, etc., potentially leading to more significant damage to
the battery (e.g., overheating, reducing battery life, or explosion).
In addition, the designed eavesdropping attack can achieve a high
accuracy in detecting and identifying the running app activities
(e.g., over 95.56% and 85.80% accuracy for calling apps and mes-
saging apps, respectively). Our work brings to light a fundamental
design vulnerability in the currently-deployed wireless charging
architecture, which may put people’s security and privacy at risk
while wirelessly recharging their smartphones.

1 INTRODUCTION
Wireless charging is making inroads in the mobile and Internet of
Things (IoT) industries as it offers the promise of increased mobility
and freedom while charging devices. For instance, Qi-certified [44]
wireless chargers for smartphones have become common in various
locations around the home, workplace, hotels, airports, and coffee
shops [4]. Plugless [34] offers wireless charging for many of the
electrical vehicles on the road today. Medium Power Standard [6]
supports wireless power delivery to portable tools (e.g., electric
drills), robotic vacuum cleaners, drones, and e-bikes. In addition,
many companies, such as Powermat [35] and WiTricity [46], pro-
vide wireless power solutions for medical implants and diagnostic
instruments, etc.
With the ever-growing deployment of such wireless charging
systems, it is essential to have a deep understanding of their vul-
nerabilities and the severity of the associated risks. In this paper,
we dissect the fundamental vulnerabilities underlying Qi wireless
charging standard [44] for mobile devices and reveal a set of se-
vere threats which may put people’s security and privacy at risk in
practice. We believe such a vulnerability analysis can not only pri-
oritize required mitigations in wireless charging for mobile devices
but also shed light on the potential security and privacy issues of
other wireless power transfer systems/standards which share many
common technologies with Qi standard, such as the Ki Cordless
Kitchen Standard [5] and the Medium Power Standard [6], etc.
Prior Research on Charging Attacks. Existing efforts have
mainly focused on exploring the vulnerabilities of wired charging
attacks. For instance, existing studies [23, 24, 28, 42, 50, 51] have
shown that wired charging stations could expose users to serious

Security Threats. Due to the open propagation property of
electromagnetic signals, using the magnetic field to deliver Qi mes-
sages has fundamental vulnerabilities. From a security perspective,
we show the potential of hijacking the communication channel by
stealthily placing an adversarial coil between the charger and the
charging device. Through a well-crafted alternating current acting
on the adversarial coil, the adversary can inject arbitrary malicious
Qi messages so as to take control of the entire charging process,
such as starting/terminating charging, manipulating the amount of
power being transferred per charging cycle, etc. As a consequence,
the adversary can cause overcharging, undercharging, pause charg-
ing, which may reduce charging efficiency, battery life and cause
overheating and even an explosion.
Privacy Threats. The Qi wireless charger needs to adjust its
transmit power density to meet the charging device’s requested
amount according to the received Qi messages (more details are
in Section 2). As all the Qi messages are transmitted via amplitude
modulation (AM) in a non-encrypted form, we show that they can
be easily eavesdropped by measuring the induced voltage on a
nearby hidden adversarial coil (e.g., stuck underneath the surface
on which the charger is placed). More importantly, Control Error
messages (introduced in Section 2.2) indicate the difference between
the actual transmit power density and the device’s requested one,
which would lead to lots of fluctuations while the charging device
changes its status or is triggered by an activity such as turning
on/off the screen, receiving an incoming phone call or a pop-up
notification from an app. This is because when an activity is trig-
gered while charging, the battery will charge at a slower rate than
inactive to allow enough power for the ongoing usage [38]. As
different activities associated with different apps rely on distinct
sets of hardware modules, we experimentally demonstrate that
they do induce identifiable power-consumption patterns which are
reflected on the transmitted Qi messages and the inductive voltage
sensed by the adversarial coil. Leveraging this side-channel, the
adversary can demodulate Qi messages and identify whether the
charging device receives a message notification, a phone call, or
the screen is manually turned on by the user. Additionally, the
adversary can further identify the specific apps (e.g., WhatsApp,
Viber, and Twitter) triggering the activities.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• To the best of our knowledge, we conduct the first thorough vul-
nerability assessment of Qi wireless charging to identify common
malicious threats and the associated risks, which we believe is
an essential step to prioritize required mitigations.
• Relying on a hidden adversarial coil stuck on the charger’s sur-
face, our validation experiments demonstrate that the adversary
can completely take control of the charging process through
injecting deliberately manipulated Qi messages in the commu-
nication channel, which may lead to more severe consequences
(e.g., terminate the charging process, reduce battery life, over-
heating, or even an explosion).
• Due to the non-encryption characteristic of the communication
channel, we show that the Qi messages can be non-intrusively
snooped by simply sticking an adversarial coil underneath the
surface on which the charger is placed. These messages carry a
variety of sensitive information, such as device ID, charging state,

privacy threats, ranging from deploying malware on the smart-
phones to inferring the browsing activity (i.e., which webpages are
loaded) and exfiltrating privacy data (e.g., IMEI, contacts’ phone
number, and chatting records). As for wireless charging systems,
although a survey paper [27] briefly mentioned the possibility of
eavesdropping attacks (e.g., stealing the identity of the charging
device) and man-in-the-middle attacks (e.g., a malicious device ma-
nipulates charging status), only initial thoughts have been provided,
with no further discussion or technical solutions proposed. A recent
study QID [49] showed the possibility of identifying different Qi-
compliant smartphones while being wirelessly charged. However,
this work only focused on the device identification while ignor-
ing other potential vulnerabilities in Qi wireless charging systems.
Moreover, denial-of-charging attacks (a.k.a, jamming attacks) have
been proposed against a variety of wireless rechargeable sensor
networks [25, 32, 33]. However, none of these attacks considered
Qi protocol for mobile devices. To the best of our knowledge, there
has yet to be research focusing on exploring the feasibility of a
more severe attack where the adversary could interfere with and
even take over the charging process.
Qi and its Possible Vulnerabilities. Qi, developed by Wire-
less Power Consortium (WPC), is the leading wireless charging
standard for providing 5-15 watts of wireless power transfer to
portable mobile devices [44]. As illustrated in Figure 1, the charger
(e.g., a charging pad) and the charging device (e.g., a smartphone)
have primary and secondary coils, respectively. During the power
transfer phase, the primary coil generates an electromagnetic field
that induces a current in the secondary coil to transfer energy. In ad-
dition, to allow the charging device to take control of the charging
procedure, Qi specifies interoperable wireless power transfer and
data communication between the charger and the charging device.
The charger thus is able to adjust the transmit power density as
requested by the charging device. However, there exists two funda-
mental vulnerabilities: (1) No encryption scheme has been used to
secure the data communication channel, making the transmitted
data (a.k.a., Qi messages) more susceptible to being interfered with
or eavesdropped; and (2) The requested power transfer density of
the charging device is highly correlated with the device’s activities
(e.g., receiving messages while being charged). This opens opportu-
nities for the adversary to detect and identify the charging device’s
activities using the eavesdropped Qi messages as well as the in-
ductive voltage of the charger. We describe how the adversary can
leverage these vulnerabilities to launch attacks in the perspectives
of security and privacy threats as follows:

Ping. The transmitter determines whether the detected receiver
is in need of power. If the receiver has a need for power, the receiver
will send a Signal Strength packet which indicates the strength of the
signal (i.e., how well the two coils are coupled) to the transmitter.
ID & C. The receiver sends the ID & C packets which carry
its specific manufacturer, model, and configuration information to
the transmitter. If the transmitter agrees to transfer power to the
receiver, the Power Transfer (PT) phase would be reached.
PT. In order to decrease the internal power consumption and
reach the best operating conditions in terms of power transfer
efficiency, Qi makes the receiver take control of the system [44].
Specifically, the receiver needs to send Control Error messages,
which indicate the difference between the requested operating
point (e.g., load voltage) and the actual one to the transmitter. After
receiving the control error message, the transmitter would adjust
the primary coil’s alternating current, thereby making the transmit
power density match the receiver’s need and satisfying its battery
management’s requirements.
2.2 Qi Message
In the Qi standard, all the communication packets (e.g., identifi-
cation, configuration, and control error) transmitted between the
transmitter and the receiver are in a non-encrypted form and are
generated by means of load modulation. Specifically, the receiver
changes its load through switching a capacitor between the sec-
ondary coil and (full bridge) rectifier, which would induce changes
in the primary coil’s alternating current.
The format of Qi communication packets is shown in Figure 3(a).
It contains a Preamble for synchronization, a Header which indicates
the type and size of the packet, a Message which contains the Qi
message, and a Checksum that aims to check the integrity of the
packet. Save for the Preamble consisting of 11-25 all ONE bits, the
other three fields use an 11-bit asynchronous serial format. They
all begin with a Start bit set to ZERO and end with a Stop bit set
to ONE. Eight data bits (LSB first) and a Parity bit are followed
by the Start bit, which are used to carry the data and check the
data’s integrity, respectively. If there is an even number of ONE
bits in the data bits, the Parity bit will be set to ONE, otherwise it
will be set to ZERO. These bits are bi-phase encoded and have a
period of 0.5ms. An example of the control error packet’s Header

and control error information, which highly correlates with the
charging device’s activities.
• Relying on the inductive voltage of the adversarial coil and its
derived Qi messages, we validate these proof-of-concept attacks
using multiple commodity smartphones. The results demonstrate
that we can detect and identify phone calls from 4 most com-
monly used calling apps and phone notification messages from 10
messaging apps with high accuracies of over 95.56% and 85.80%
accuracy, respectively.
• We analyze and evaluate several defense mechanisms including
frequency-based hijacking signal detection and chaotic noise
addition that can mitigate the effects of the proposed attacks. A
few more potential directions about defense are also discussed.
2 BACKGROUND
2.1 Qi Wireless Charging
Generally, the charging process involves two main components: a
power transmitter (e.g., a charging pad) and a compatible power
receiver (e.g., a smartphone). Relying on the oscillating electromag-
netic field, the power can be transferred wirelessly between the
two coils (i.e., primary coil and secondary coil) embedded in the
power transmitter and receiver, respectively. Specifically, an alter-
nating current in the primary coil produces an oscillating magnetic
field which in turn induces an alternating current in the secondary
coil in close proximity. By attaching a load (e.g., a battery) to the
secondary coil, the induced alternating current can be used for
charging purposes.
To enable interoperable and efficient wireless power transfer, Qi
allows the power receiver to be in control of the charging procedure.
The Qi-compliant transmitter is capable of communicating with
the receiver and adjusting its transmit power density as requested
by the receiver. A systematic overview of Qi wireless charging
protocol is illustrated in Figure 2. Specifically, it has four different
phases as follows:
Selection. The transmitter continuously monitors its surface for
the presence of any object. If the presence of an object is detected,
the transmitter will move to the Ping phase and also send out an
