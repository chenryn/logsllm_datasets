User: Please describe the core components responsible for container scheduling in Kubernetes, their functions and working principles.
Assistant: The core components responsible for container scheduling in Kubernetes include: 1. Kubernetes Scheduler: Kubernetes Scheduler is an independent component in the Kubernetes cluster, which is responsible for scheduling Pods to appropriate Nodes. The Scheduler will make decisions based on the resource requirements, affinity and anti-affinity rules in the Pod, and then schedule the Pod to run on the most suitable Node. 2. Kubernetes Controller Manager: Kubernetes Controller Manager is a core component in Kubernetes, which contains multiple controllers to monitor the status of the cluster and take measures as needed. Controllers covered include replica set controllers, service controllers, node controllers, and more. These controllers are very important to the proper functioning of Kubernetes. 3. Kubernetes API Server: Kubernetes API Server is one of the core components in Kubernetes, which provides a RESTful API for administrators and applications to interact with Kubernetes. The main functions of API Server include verifying and authorizing requests, receiving and processing requests, and performing operations, etc. These components work together to implement the container scheduling function of Kubernetes. How it works: First, the application administrator submits a request to create a Pod using the Kubernetes API Server. Then, Kubernetes Scheduler will receive this request, and according to the resource requirements, affinity and anti-affinity rules in the Pod, it will schedule the Pod to run on the most suitable Node. At the same time, the Kubernetes Controller Manager will monitor the cluster status and take measures as needed, such as when a Node fails, a new Pod will be started to keep the application running. Collectively, these core components enable centralized management of Kubernetes, making it easier to deploy and maintain large-scale applications.
