User: I know we cant change the parent of an entity that is stored , but can we change the parent of the entity that is not stored? For example i am declaring a model as 
    my_model = MyModel(parent = ParentModel1.key)
but after some checks i may have to change the parent of my_model (i have not run my_model.put() ) to ParentModel2. How can i do this ?
Assistant: create a new model with the data from the existing one..
or don't create the model until you have all the facts.
