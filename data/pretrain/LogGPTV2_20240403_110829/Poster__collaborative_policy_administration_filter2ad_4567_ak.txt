Governments should consider promoting the creation of ‘public innovation places’ 
where professionals from different backgrounds (design, economics, policy and 
social knowledge) can operate in a more horizontal, non-hierarchical ways, and 
where they can complement each other, as opposed to one form of knowledge 
dictating how the others will operate.

ABSTRACT
The process to involve students from several schools and neighborhood inhabitants as well as the public sector 
in design activities aimed at social innovation, presents a series of challenges worth reflecting upon. One 
might ask oneself: what are some of the main ingredients that play a part in the success of such a project? How 
do these influence the various stakeholders involved? This article aims to draw attention to seven such key 
learnings, using the “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” project as its main inspiration and case study.

1.  CONTEXT
Throughout the academic year 2012-2013, design 
students from MAD Faculty in Genk (B) together with 
students from 7 other design schools in the EU-region 
Meuse-Rhine, participated in the project “Welcome 
to Saint-Gilles”1. An initiative of Reciprocity (Liège’s 
International Design Biennial) with the support of 
Wallonie Design and Recentre, the project aimed to 
create small design interventions to meet social needs 
of the people living in the Saint-Gilles neighborhood 
in Liège (Belgium). For many students it was their first 
encounter with the principles and methods of design 
for social innovation. 
In this chapter, the authors - who have been involved 
in the project as design educators, project leaders as 
well as experts invited to reflect upon the work of 
students of the other participating schools - would 
like to share a selection of lessons learnt regarding 
the design of the process as such, stakeholder and 
designer roles as well as more general points of 
attention. These lessons build further upon insights 
gained within the context of the “Welcome to Saint-
Gilles” and similar projects on design for social 
innovation in which both authors have been involved 
over the past few years.
The following paragraphs will explain seven such key 
insights taking into account the roles and perspectives 
of stakeholders generally involved, e.g. that of the 
educator, the student, neighborhood inhabitants, local 
policymakers, etc.
2.  SEVEN REFLECTIONS
In the case study at hand, design for social innovation 
has been addressed as a challenge best tackled by 
means of a participatory/collaborative approach. As 
such, the project brought together a wide range of 
stakeholders which were involved in the analysis 
of the situation at hand as well as the co-creation 
of (seeds for) solutions. These included design 
students and educators from 8 design schools from 
1  When addressing student activities during the “Welcome to Saint-
Gilles” project within the context of this text, the authors mainly 
address those carried out by the students of the MAD Faculty. 
While most activities were similar across the various participating 
design schools, there have been differences in approach. These 
were a valuable part of the learning experience across schools, 
yet go beyond the scope of this text. For more information on 
the project, see http://www.designliege.be/en-293-welcome_to_
saint_gilles.html 
3 different countries, neighborhood inhabitants and 
local entrepreneurs, local policymakers and staff, 
public sector staff (design organization) as well as 
experts on design for social innovation. The degree 
of participation of these stakeholders varied from 
providing access to people and facilities for design 
activities to take place, to  providing information and 
feedback on student ideas through interviews and 
workshops.
The following paragraphs will attempt to reflect 
upon the design process followed, the stakeholders 
roles and interactions that took place and do so in 
retrospect. A selection of seven practical insights will 
be given, some of which may sound trivial, as they 
share points of attention with participatory design or 
multi-stakeholder processes in general. Yet experience 
shows that they continue to be overlooked in practice 
and are generally insufficiently addressed in most 
student courses on the matter. Hence the authors 
wish to shed some extra light upon them so that 
other schools engaging their students in real-life, 
collaborative projects on design for social innovation 
might benefit.
2.1 Managing expectations
To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly 
modern intellect.”
—Oscar Wilde
In most projects in which various stakeholders - such 
as students, educators, inhabitants or users, local 
policymakers and/or civil servants - are involved, 
the eventual perception of success depends on how 
well expectations are managed in advance. Each 
stakeholder will participate with expectations shaped 
by their specific context and agenda. Educators for 
example wish to guide the learning process of the 
students. Students wish to learn, obtain a sufficient 
grade or create a solution perceived as valuable by 
the inhabitants. Policy-makers and civil servants 
wish to have a qualitative result on which they can 
build. Inhabitants expect working solutions, etc. All 
these perspectives imply different requirements 
in terms of process and envisioned result. Meeting 
all expectations to their fullest extent is often not 
feasible for practical reasons of available time, 
resources and/or expertise. Especially then it is crucial 
40
that expectations are made explicit, discussed and 
put in the right perspective as early on in the process 
as possible. Only then they can be managed and the 
process and its results can be tuned to the extent 
possible. Project coordinators need to facilitate this 
discussion as to find the right equilibrium and provide 
clarity to the various stakeholders. Key questions for 
the moderator to address in this matter could be: 
“What do you hope to get out of this project?”, “When 
would you consider it a success?”. “What would you think 
would be needed to achieve this?”, “Do we have (access 
to) it?”. Addressing these questions collectively helps 
to build mutual understanding of what is needed, what 
can be achieved and thus what can be expected and 
what cannot.
As people voice their expectations, one also 
gains a deeper insight into the link between 
expectations, levels of ambition and dynamics of 
engagement between stakeholders. For example, 
“As people voice their 
expectations, one also gains 
a deeper insight into the link 
between expectations, levels 
of ambition and dynamics 
of engagement between 
stakeholders.”
when expectations, vested interests and means of 
local policymakers are very high, this might give 
wings to ambitious students and citizens to be more 
engaged. When teachers emphasize the necessity 
for their students above all to learn from their 
experience, local citizens might feel their problems 
are not taken as seriously as they would like them 
to be and consequently feel less engaged. A deeper 
understanding of the dynamics between stakeholders, 
can inform the further fine tuning of the design 
process. In their role as facilitators of communication, 
designers need to develop the sensitivity needed in 
order to pick up on these signals.
In the case of “Welcome to Saint-Gilles”2, early on in 
the process it was made clear to local policymakers

that the results would be “seeds” of social innovation 
which would need further care and investment by the 
local community and its supporters. They would show 
potential, yet not deliver complete solutions as such. 
As the various student projects inspired the collective 
imagination of the local community, expectations of 
the final results grew but so did the understanding 
of local inhabitants that their own role was crucial to 
make things work.
2.2 Managing momentum
“It might be true that it is “quality time” that 
counts, but after a certain point quantity has a 
bearing on quality.” 
—Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
From a ‘project’ point of view, activities have a clear 
beginning and an end. A problem is delineated and one 
works towards a solution, of which the delivery forms 
the culmination point of the project. In a participatory 
setting however, there is a ‘process’ component to 
activities which requires additional attention. From a 
‘process’ point of view, for example, ‘momentum’3 is of 
key importance regarding stakeholder involvement. It 
is closely linked to engagement as stakeholders feel 
more engaged - and thus willing to invest attention 
and effort into the cause - as they see things happen, 
feel appreciated as they are invited to participate, feel 
part of making change happen etc.
Momentum and hence also engagement are 
influenced by many factors such as frequency and 
quality of communication and interaction, depth and 
nature of stakeholder involvement, progress and 
results, sense of (co-)ownership, etc. As such, building 
and managing momentum over the timespan of a 
project is an important task for the project coordinator. 
Depending on the phase of the project, he/she will 
aim to modulate momentum as the driving power 
of stakeholder involvement in view of the goals 
throughout the process.
During “Welcome to Saint-Gilles”, fluctuations of 
momentum could be experienced on various levels. 
During the research phase of the project, the streets 
were often abuzz with students talking to shop-owners, 
local inhabitants and passers-by releasing their 
3  Both quantitative momentum, i.e. measurable in terms of number 
and frequency of events, and perceived or qualitative momentum, 
i.e. as experienced by resp. stakeholders, play a key role.
urban probes, bringing furniture to the park to test a 
concept or attract attention, etc. while later periods 
during which students were hard at work prototyping 
solutions, were calm and showed less activity in 
the streets. Also, for most participating schools, the 
amount of time for and frequency of contact with the 
local inhabitants were limited and - for reasons of 
manageability - focussed on specific moments. A select 
group of inhabitants, for example, were interviewed by 
students from the various schools on these occasions, 
often zooming in on similar questions as students 
tried to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges 
and opportunities of the neighborhood. Repetition of 
questions led to fatigue with this group, eventually 
causing a narrowing of focus, often with a bias toward 
the negative characteristics of their neighborhoods 
or nostalgia for times bygone. For them, this led to a 
change in perception of momentum, as being a little 
stuck in the moment.
Another swing of momentum could be noticed towards 
the end of the project. A beautifully crafted exhibition4 
of the project results featured about 80 ideas to 
revitalize the neighborhood and concluded the project. 
They were seeds to be taken home, planted and 
cared for by local inhabitants. A chocolate map of the 
neighborhood - proposed by one of the students5 - for 
example, was already in production by a local artisan 
by the end of the project. Another student’s proposal to 
organize an evening walk using community-built paper 
lanterns6 had awoken interest in local community 
members to breathe life into a new tradition.7 
Although these were clear signs that local initiative 
had received a boost and people were adopting some 
of the seeds of ideas sown, people voiced their concern 
that as students would leave and no-one would be left 
behind or appointed to keep discussions and initiative

Intrigued by the idea of creating a new tradition, some local 
inhabitants decided to revisit their neighborhood history. Hence 
recently they decided to blend the old with the new and organize 
a street festival - ‘Le pèlerinage des musiciens’ - to be organized in 
collaboration with/by the neighborhood team (‘le mouvement Saint-
Gilles’), guided by local project partner ID Campus. The wrapping

local artisanal chocolate shop will feature an information leaflet on 
the event.
going, momentum would die out.8 With this, they 
would soon return to their previous state or worse: 
with yet another confirmation of the ingrained false 
belief of powerlessness, of incapability of bringing 
about change on their own.
With the exhibition and the implicit conclusion of the 
involvement of the schools, “Welcome to Saint-Gilles” 
has entered a handover-phase. Not only the results, 
but the enthusiasm and hopes awakened in the hearts 
of many stakeholders need to be carried over. The 
responsibility of the designer (see also “designing out 
the designer”) hence extends beyond the delivery of 
the results, however small.
One could argue that in the context of a school-
driven project certain degrees of quality and 
responsibility cannot be guaranteed as it concerns a 
learning experience. Yet even when the expectations 
are carefully managed, working within a real-life
