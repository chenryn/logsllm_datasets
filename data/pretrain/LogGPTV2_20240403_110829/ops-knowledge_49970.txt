Question: A web administrator decides to implement HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) to enhance the security of their maximum risk site. The administrator is aware of the potential risks associated with HPKP and is cautious to avoid any missteps. Which of the following actions would be prudent to take before fully enabling HPKP on the production domain?
"A": "Deploying HPKP with a long 'max-age' directive to ensure maximum protection.",
"B": "Testing HPKP on a non-production domain with `Public-Key-Pins-Report-Only` before full implementation.",
"C": "Using a single key pin and avoiding backup pins to simplify the configuration process.",
"D": "Implementing HPKP without testing since most modern browsers automatically handle the associated risks."
Answer: B
