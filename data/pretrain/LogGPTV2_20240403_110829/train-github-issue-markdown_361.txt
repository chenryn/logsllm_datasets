# Bug report
## Describe the bug
So there is a `./pages/_document.js` and ``, even if you remove
it next.js will include all the bundles. I'm curious why ``
seems to not matter. Nothing changes if I remove it or add it back.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. Go to https://with-nextscript-llzwhvgbup.now.sh (it is with-emotion example deployed as is)
  2. Check Network tab in dev tools
  3. Scripts are being dowloaded
  4. Go to https://without-nextscript-vmfhuqxgbt.now.sh (it is with-emotion example with removed `` and deployed)
  5. Check Network tab in dev tools
  6. Scripts are **still** being dowloaded
build process is `next build && next export`
## Expected behavior
No scripts should be in place
