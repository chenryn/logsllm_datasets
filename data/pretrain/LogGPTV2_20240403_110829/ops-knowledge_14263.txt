User: There is a large-scale website that needs to support tens of millions of visits per second. Please provide a plan for extending the site architecture.
Assistant: To support tens of millions of visits per second, the following solutions need to be considered: 1. Vertical expansion: perform hardware upgrades such as memory expansion and CPU upgrades on existing servers to improve performance. However, this method is expensive, and as the number of visits continues to grow, it must continue to expand. 2. Horizontal expansion: split the service into multiple small services and distribute them through the load balancer. Each service runs on an independent server, and the number of servers can be increased or decreased as needed. This method is relatively cheaper and can better adapt to business changes. 3. CDN acceleration: Using content distribution network (CDN) services can reduce the pressure on the server, cache static resources, and improve user access speed. CDN can deploy nodes all over the world to ensure that user requests can be responded as quickly as possible. 4. Database optimization: For large websites, the database is usually the bottleneck. Optimizing database query statements, using cache, fragmentation, etc. can improve database performance. 5. Asynchronous architecture: When there are a large number of concurrent requests, synchronous operations may cause thread blocking and affect performance. Using an asynchronous architecture to distribute requests to different worker threads can improve concurrent processing capabilities. 6. Automated deployment: Automated deployment can reduce the influence of human factors and ensure the stability and reliability of services. Using containerization technology such as Docker, you can quickly deploy, start and stop services, and provide elastic scalability to adapt to large traffic changes. To sum up, the above is an extended website architecture solution that can support tens of millions of visits per second.
