the  statistics  community.  It  used  to  collect  the  information 
from individuals such that, the survey interviewers and the 
data  processors  do  not  know  which  of  the  two  alternative 
questions  are  respondent  have  answered.  In  data  mining, 
The method of randomization is a simple technique, can be 
very  easily  applied  at  data  collection  time.  It  was  a  useful 
technique  for  hiding  individual  data  in  privacy  reserving 
data  mining.  The  randomization  method  is  more  efficient. 
Though, it results in high information loss. 
The literature on Privacy-Preserving Mining of Association 
rules  can  be  classified  into  Pattern  mining  task,  privacy 
model, and finally Encryption/Decryption scheme. 
2.1  Pattern Mining Task 
It  is  assumed  that  the  reader  is  familiar  with  the  basics  of 
association  rule  mining.  The  most  known  and  frequent 
pattern mining problem is explained in [13] as: 
Given a transaction database ‘D’ and a support threshold ‘x’, 
then  with  support  of  ‘D’  and  with  at  least  ‘x’,  find  all  the 
item  sets.  It  is  confined  with  the  study  of  a  Privacy 
Preserving  Outsourcing  Framework  for  Frequent  Pattern 
Mining, in this paper. 
2.2  Privacy Model 
For the protection of the identification of the individual data 
items,  the  data  owner  encrypts  the  original  dataset,  and 
transforms  it  in  an  encrypted  database.  Items  in  original 
database  can  be  called  as  Plain  items,  whereas  items  in 
encrypted database can be called as Cipher items. 
The server or an intruder may have background knowledge 
of  the  encrypted  database  to  attack  it.  Therefore,  the 
proposed  scheme  is  based  on  the  two  main  points:  first, 
replacing  each  item  in  database  with  1  to  1  substituted 
ciphers,  and  second,  adding  some  fake  transactions  in  the 
encrypted database. 
2.3  Encryption/Decryption Scheme 
2.3.1  Encryption 
In this step, we have added an encryption algorithm called, 
“RobFrugal”; this is used to transform a transaction database 
into its encrypted version.  It consists of three prime phases: 
1. For each plain item, using a 1-1 substitution cipher text. 
2. A specific item grouping method need to be used. 
3. A method is needed to add fake transactions. 
2.3.2  Decryption 
After  the  client  requests  a  pattern  execution  query  to  be 
executed to the server, with the specified support threshold, 
the  server  will  always  return  the  encrypted  databases 
computed frequency patterns. This projected E-D scheme is 
practical resolution for a Privacy Preserving Pattern Mining 
rather  than  the  outsourced  Transaction  database,  but  the 
correct  and  efficient  implementation  needed  to  be  existed. 
On  the  other  side,  storing  the  support  for  every  cipher 
pattern is not practical. 
2.4  Grouping items for Privacy 
Some of the strategies can be adopted to classify the items 
into  the  groups  of  fixed  size,  given  that  the  items  in 
supported table. A method called Frugal is used to initiate. 
We  also  presume  that  the  item  support  table  is  in  the 
descending  orderly  of  support  sorted  and  the  cipher  items 
are  referred  in  this  order.  Given  the  detail  that  says,  the 
support of the items will strictly lowers monotonically. And

if the item support table is sorted in the support’s descending 
order, the frugal grouping is optional in this technique. 
2.5  Constructing Fake Transaction 
If  a  noise  table  is  given,  with  the  specifying  noise  that  is 
needed  for  every  cipher  item.  The  fake  transactions  are 
generated as follows: 
1. Corresponding to the highest common items of each group 
or to remaining items with equal support to the maximum 
support of the group, we will drop all the rows with zero 
noise. 
2. The remaining rows will be sorted by the descending 
order of the noise added. 
3. Proposed System 
With  the  help  of  Rob-Frugal  Algorithms  as  basic  idea  to 
develop new system, which is efficient in maintaining Time 
and  Space  complexity  in  feasible  criterion  as  comparing 
with previous ones. 
As we will concern about security of third party server and 
probably  considering  data  mining-as-a-service,  cloud  data 
security will be handled on primary basis. Various issues in 
previous privacy preserving and security of outsourced data 
are thus to be considered to handle with new improved and 
efficient system proposed on behalf of elaborating attacker’s 
behavior pattern .  
The  proposed  system  will  elaborate  privacy  preserving  of 
association rules in cloud with emerged standards of: 
1)  Pattern Matching Task  
2)  Privacy Model 
3)  Encryption/Decryption Scheme 
4)  Elaboration of Attack Models in Future 
4. Conclusion 
Preserving  privacy  in  data  mining  activities  is  a  very 
important  issue  in  many  applications.  Most  randomization 
based techniques are likely to play an important role in this 
domain. In this paper, a new approach to solve the problem 
of  privacy  preserving  data  mining  in  the  scenario  of 
outsourced  business  transaction  database  has  been  solved 
successfully. This approach is efficient and better than many 
other  perturbation  and  anonymity  techniques.  Proposed 
system  will  reduce  the  time  and  space  required  for 
execution,  as  well  as  false  rules  problems  in  effective 
manner from the previous work.
