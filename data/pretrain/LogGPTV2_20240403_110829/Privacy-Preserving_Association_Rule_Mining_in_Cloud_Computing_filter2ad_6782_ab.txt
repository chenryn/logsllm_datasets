### Introduction to the Statistics Community and Randomization in Data Mining

The statistics community has historically relied on collecting information from individuals in a manner that ensures survey interviewers and data processors remain unaware of which of two alternative questions a respondent has answered. In the context of data mining, randomization is a straightforward technique that can be easily applied during data collection. This method is particularly useful for preserving individual privacy by hiding specific data points. Although randomization is efficient, it can result in significant information loss.

### Privacy-Preserving Mining of Association Rules

The literature on privacy-preserving mining of association rules can be categorized into three main areas: pattern mining tasks, privacy models, and encryption/decryption schemes.

#### 2.1 Pattern Mining Task

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the basics of association rule mining. The most well-known frequent pattern mining problem, as described in [13], involves:

- Given a transaction database \( D \) and a support threshold \( x \),
- Find all item sets in \( D \) with support at least \( x \).

This paper focuses on a privacy-preserving outsourcing framework for frequent pattern mining.

#### 2.2 Privacy Model

To protect the identification of individual data items, the data owner encrypts the original dataset, transforming it into an encrypted database. Items in the original database are referred to as "plain items," while those in the encrypted database are called "cipher items."

The server or an intruder may have background knowledge about the encrypted database, making it vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, the proposed scheme includes two main strategies:
1. Replacing each item in the database with a one-to-one substituted cipher.
2. Adding some fake transactions to the encrypted database.

#### 2.3 Encryption/Decryption Scheme

##### 2.3.1 Encryption

In this step, we introduce an encryption algorithm called "RobFrugal," which transforms a transaction database into its encrypted version. The process consists of three key phases:
1. For each plain item, use a one-to-one substitution cipher.
2. Employ a specific item grouping method.
3. Add fake transactions to the database.

##### 2.3.2 Decryption

After the client requests a pattern execution query with a specified support threshold, the server returns the frequency patterns computed from the encrypted database. This encryption-decryption (E-D) scheme is a practical solution for privacy-preserving pattern mining. However, correct and efficient implementation is crucial. Storing the support for every cipher pattern is not practical.

#### 2.4 Grouping Items for Privacy

Several strategies can be adopted to classify items into groups of fixed size, given the supported table. A method called "Frugal" is used to initiate this process. We assume that the item support table is sorted in descending order of support, and cipher items are referenced in this order. Given that the support of items strictly decreases monotonically, the frugal grouping is optional if the item support table is already sorted by support.

#### 2.5 Constructing Fake Transactions

If a noise table is provided, specifying the required noise for each cipher item, fake transactions can be generated as follows:
1. For the highest common items in each group or for remaining items with equal support to the maximum support of the group, drop all rows with zero noise.
2. Sort the remaining rows in descending order of the added noise.

### Proposed System

The proposed system, based on the Rob-Frugal algorithms, aims to maintain time and space complexity within feasible criteria compared to previous methods. Security concerns, especially in the context of third-party servers and cloud data, are addressed. Various issues in previous privacy-preserving and security of outsourced data are considered to develop an improved and efficient system.

The proposed system will enhance privacy preservation in cloud-based association rule mining with the following standards:
1. Pattern Matching Task
2. Privacy Model
3. Encryption/Decryption Scheme
4. Elaboration of Attack Models in Future

### Conclusion

Privacy preservation in data mining activities is a critical issue in many applications. Randomization-based techniques play a significant role in this domain. This paper presents a new approach to address privacy-preserving data mining in the context of outsourced business transaction databases. The proposed system is more efficient and effective than many other perturbation and anonymity techniques, reducing the time and space required for execution and mitigating false rules problems.
