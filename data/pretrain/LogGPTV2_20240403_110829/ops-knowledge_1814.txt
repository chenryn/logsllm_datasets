Question: Why does cookie policy use a different set of rules than the same origin policy?
"A": "Because cookie policy is designed around domain-matching rules to determine which server can read the cookie, whereas the same origin policy is based on exact domain matching for security reasons.",
"B": "Because the same origin policy applies to actions such as writing to the DOM of a webpage, while cookie policy only governs the inclusion of cookies in HTTP requests.",
"C": "Because cookie policy is less strict than the same origin policy, allowing for greater flexibility in sharing cookies across related domains.",
"D": "Because they are governed by different RFCs and have evolved independently to serve different aspects of web security."
Answer: C
