Proof: Since the sum of the total population in a state is
𝑀∑
constant, we can write∑
(4)
for any partition of states 𝑆 ⊆ 𝐸𝐵𝐴𝑆, where we omit 𝑛𝑖 = 0
since the corresponding term in the summation is zero. Deﬁne
𝑆 as the set of states where the blocked queue list is m and
queue 𝑗 has population 𝑛𝑗 in phase 𝑘𝑗, thus the right hand
side becomes 𝑁 𝜋(𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎). Denote by 𝒔𝑘 the components
of 𝒔 different from 𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎. We can equivalently
rewrite the above expression as

𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒔𝑘, 𝒎) =𝑁 𝜋 (𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎)

However, the inner summation on 𝒔𝑘 gives the QR marginal
𝜋(𝑛𝑖, 𝑘𝑖, 𝑛𝑗, 𝑘𝑗, 𝒎) which proves the theorem.
The above characterization generalizes in a weaker form also
to second-order queue-length moments.

The proof is qualitatively similar to the one used for non-

reader to [8, Thm. 4] for a complete derivation.
D. Marginal Balance Conditions
The theorems in the previous section provide a characteriza-
tion of basic properties of utilization and queue-lengths in the
QR marginal representation. However, these properties depend
very loosely on the inter-dependencies between stations, such
as the ﬂows of jobs between queues and the rules of BAS
blocking. A strong characterization of BAS blocking and
job ﬂows is provided by the following marginal balance
conditions. Such conditions express (by the QR marginals)
the probability ﬂux balance resulting from cuts of the Markov
chain that separate states with a marginal population 𝑛𝑖 from
those where queue 𝑖 has population 𝑛𝑖 + 1.
Theorem 4 (Marginal balance): The arrival ﬂow of queue 𝑖
when the local queue-length is of 𝑛𝑖 jobs, 0  0) toward queue 𝑖. After these
departures, the population of 𝑖 becomes 𝑛𝑖 + 1, except in the
case where 𝑗 = 𝑓 and 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(m) =𝑖, i.e., queue 𝑖 is unblocked
by the departure from 𝑓. In this case, queue 𝑖 is waiting for
free space in 𝑓 and, because of the simultaneous transitions,
the population in 𝑖 remains equal to 𝑛𝑖. As a consequence,
when 𝑗 = 𝑓, the condition 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(m) ∕= 𝑖 must be also true,
this corresponds to the second term of the left side of (9).
The right hand side of the equation considers all departures
from queue 𝑖 with population equal to 𝑛𝑖 + 1. After these de-
partures, 𝑖’s population becomes 𝑛𝑖. These departures include:
∙ Case a: Transitions from 𝑖 towards any queue 𝑗, 𝑗 ∕= 𝑖.
Note that these transitions are always possible because
queue 𝑗 does not have ﬁnite capacity, and for queue 𝑓
this transition can occur when 𝑛𝑓 < 𝐹𝑓 ; this is the ﬁrst
term of the right side. When queue 𝑓 is full, a transition
from 𝑖 is still possible if queue 𝑖 is not blocked, that is 𝑖
is not in the m list; this case corresponds to the second
term of the right side of (9).
∙ Case b: Transitions from node 𝑓 to any other node 𝑤,
𝑤 ∕= 𝑓, 𝑤 ∕= 𝑖 when 𝑓 is full and node 𝑖 is the ﬁrst
blocked one, that is 𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑(m) = 𝑖. These transitions
trigger a simultaneous transition from queue 𝑖,
thus
decrease its population to 𝑛𝑖. This is the third term on
the right side of (9).
𝑖 = 𝑘}.
Let 𝑆(𝑘, 𝑛𝑖) ≡ {s = (s1, s2, . . . sM)∣si : 𝑛′
Since the theorem requires 𝑛𝑖 ≤ 𝐹𝑖 − 1,
there always
exists the related set ¯𝑆(𝑘, 𝑛𝑖) ≡ {s = (s1, s2, . . . sM)∣si
:
𝑖 = 𝑘}. The equilibrium probability ﬂux
𝑖 ≥ 𝑛𝑖 + 1, 𝑘′
𝑛′
𝑘=1𝑆(𝑘, 𝑛𝑖) and ∪𝐾𝑖
exchanged by ∪𝐾𝑖
¯𝑆(𝑘, 𝑛𝑖) must be in
balance because their union is the entire state space. We seek
for a representation of the exchanged probability ﬂux using
the QR marginal probabilities. The ﬂux 𝐹 from ∪𝐾𝑖
¯𝑆(𝑘, 𝑛𝑖)
to ∪𝐾𝑖
𝑘=1𝑆(𝑘, 𝑛𝑖) needs to decrease the queue-length of queue 𝑖
to 𝑛𝑖. By considering that batch completions are not allowed,
these transitions correspond to the two cases described above.
Therefore, 𝐹 is the following ﬂux of completions:
