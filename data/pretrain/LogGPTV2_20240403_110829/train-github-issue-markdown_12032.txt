As noted in issue #5048, we should consider supporting the import of data URLs. The following example demonstrates how this can be achieved in Chromium:

```javascript
await import("data:application/javascript;charset=utf-8;base64,Y29uc29sZS5sb2coImhlbGxvIHdvcmxkIik7");
```

This code will log `hello world` to the console.
