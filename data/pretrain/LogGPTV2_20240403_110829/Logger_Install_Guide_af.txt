### Viewing and Managing Processes with `loggerd`

To view the processes that can be started, stopped, or restarted using `loggerd`, follow these steps:
1. Click on **System Admin** from the top-level menu bar.
2. Under **System**, select **Process Status**.
3. The list of processes will be displayed on the right under the **Processes** section.

The following table outlines the subcommands available with `loggerd` and their purposes:

| Command         | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `loggerd start` | Starts all processes listed under the System and Process sections. Use this command to launch Logger. |
| `loggerd stop`  | Stops processes listed under the Process section only. Use this command when you want to leave `loggerd` running but all other processes stopped. |
| `loggerd restart` | Restarts processes listed under the Process section only. Note: When using `loggerd restart` to restart Logger, the status message for the "aps" process will initially display "Process ‘aps’ Execution failed." After a few seconds, the message will change to "Process ‘aps’ running." |
| `loggerd status` | Displays the status of all processes. |
| `loggerd quit`  | Stops all processes listed under the System and Process sections. Use this command to stop Logger. |
| `loggerd start <process_name>` | Starts the specified process. For example, `loggerd start apache`. |
| `loggerd stop <process_name>` | Stops the specified process. For example, `loggerd stop apache`. |
| `loggerd restart <process_name>` | Restarts the specified process. For example, `loggerd restart apache`. |

You can also manage and view the status of Logger processes from the **System Admin > System > Process Status** page. For more information, refer to the Logger Administrator’s Guide or the online help.

### Uninstalling Logger

To uninstall the Logger software, you have two options:
1. **Delete the VM**: Simply delete the virtual machine (VM) containing the Logger software.
2. **Uninstall from the VM**:
   - If you are uninstalling over an SSH connection and want to use GUI mode, ensure X window forwarding is enabled using the `-X` option. If using PuTTY, you will also need an X client on the machine from which you are connecting to the Linux machine.
   - Before uninstalling, stop and quit the Logger processes by using the `loggerd stop` and `loggerd quit` commands, as described in the Using Software Logger Command Line Options section.

To uninstall the Logger software, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the installation directory and run the following command:
   ```sh
   ./UninstallerData/Uninstall_ArcSight_Logger_7.0.1
   ```
2. The uninstall wizard will launch. Click **Uninstall** or press **Enter** to start the uninstallation process.

### Configuring Logger

This chapter provides basic deployment and configuration information applicable to all Logger types. If you have installed multiple Loggers, you must configure each one separately or use ArcSight Management Center for bulk configuration changes. For detailed instructions, refer to the following guides:
- **Direct Configuration and Administration**: Refer to the Logger Administrator’s Guide.
- **ArcSight Management Center**: Refer to the ArcSight Management Center Administrator’s Guide.
- **Connectors**: Refer to the documentation for each specific Connector.

#### Receiving Events and Logs

Logger comes preconfigured with several receivers ready to receive events and log files directly from devices and systems on your network, such as syslog servers, NFS, CIFS, or SAN systems. Note that Software Logger requires the `zip` and `unzip` packages to be pre-installed on the Linux OS to correctly retrieve logs and prevent rotation.

Logger can also receive events from ArcSight SmartConnectors. A subset of SmartConnectors is supported for Trial Logger and can be downloaded from the same location where you downloaded Logger. The Configuration Guides for the supported SmartConnectors are available at the same website. For more information on ArcSight SmartConnectors, visit [ArcSight SmartConnectors](#).

#### Receivers

After installing Logger, you can set up receivers to listen for events. Logger includes preconfigured receivers, and you can add, change, or delete them as needed. The preconfigured receivers include:
- TCP Receiver
- UDP Receiver
- SmartMessage Receiver
- Folder Follower Receivers for Apache Access Error Log, system Messages Log, and system Messages Audit Log (if auditing is enabled on your Linux OS).

To receive data, the receiver's ports must be allowed through any firewall rules. See "Firewall Rules" on page 15 for more information. You must enable these receivers to use them. See "Enabling the Preconfigured Folder Follower Receivers" on the next page for instructions.

For further details on receivers, refer to the Configuration chapter of the Logger Administrator’s Guide.

#### Enabling the Preconfigured Folder Follower Receivers

When you first log in using the URL you configured, the preconfigured folder follower receivers are disabled. To enable them, follow these steps:
1. Click on the **Receivers** link under the Home page to open the Receivers page.
2. Identify the receiver you want to enable and click the disabled icon () at the end of the row.

Tip: Before enabling these receivers, make sure that `/var/log/audit/audit.log` and `/var/log/messages` are readable by the non-root user you installed with or specified during Logger installation.

#### Configuring New Receivers

In addition to the out-of-box receivers, you can configure other types of receivers to meet your needs. The available receiver types include:
- **UDP Receiver**: Listens for User Datagram Protocol messages on the specified port. The pre-installed UDP receiver is enabled by default.
- **CEF UDP Receiver**: Receives events in Common Event Format.
- **TCP Receiver**: Listens for Transmission Control Protocol messages on the specified port. The pre-installed TCP receiver is enabled by default.
- **CEF TCP Receiver**: Receives events in Common Event Format.
- **File Receiver**: Reads log files from a local file system, Network File System (NFS), Common Internet File System (CIFS), or Storage Area Network (SAN). File receivers read single or multi-line log files.
- **Folder Follower Receiver**: Actively reads log files in a specified directory as they are updated. If the source directory contains different types of log files, you can create a receiver for each type.
- **File Transfer Receiver**: Reads remote log files using Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), or File Transfer Protocol (FTP). These receivers can read single- or multi-line log files and can be scheduled to read files periodically.
- **SmartMessage Receiver**: Listens for encrypted messages from ArcSight SmartConnectors. To use the pre-installed receiver, you must configure a SmartConnector to send events to it.

Caution: The SCP and SFTP protocols on Logger appliances are not FIPS compliant. The SCP, SFTP, and FTP file transfer receivers depend on the respective clients installed on your system.

#### Sending Structured Data to Logger

Although Logger is message-agnostic, it can do more with messages that adhere to the Common Event Format (CEF), an industry standard for event interoperability. Events in CEF format have more defined columns, making the data more useful. Logger can receive structured data in the form of normalized CEF events from ArcSight SmartConnectors. For more information about CEF, refer to the Implementing ArcSight CEF guide, available for download at [ArcSight CEF Guide](#).

#### Using SmartConnectors to Collect Events

Similar to ArcSight Manager, Logger leverages ArcSight SmartConnectors to collect events. SmartConnectors can read security events from heterogeneous devices on a network, filter events of interest, and send them to a Logger receiver. Logger can receive structured data in the form of normalized CEF events from the SmartConnectors.

For more information on SmartConnectors, refer to the documentation for that Connector and the SmartConnector User's Guide, available at [ArcSight SmartConnectors](#).

#### SmartMessage

SmartMessage is a Micro Focus ArcSight technology that provides an efficient, secure channel for CEF events between ArcSight SmartConnectors and Logger. SmartMessage uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create an end-to-end encrypted secure channel. One end is an ArcSight SmartConnector, receiving events from various devices, and the other end is a SmartMessage receiver on Logger.

Note: The SmartMessage secure channel uses TLS protocol to send encrypted events to Logger, similar to, but different from, the encrypted binary protocol used between SmartConnectors and ArcSight Manager.

#### Configuring a SmartConnector to Send Events to Logger

Logger comes pre-configured with a SmartMessage Receiver. To receive events from a SmartConnector, you must configure the SmartConnector as follows:

1. Install the SmartConnector component using the SmartConnector User’s Guide as a reference. Specify Logger as the destination instead of ArcSight ESM or a CEF file.
2. Specify the required parameters:
   - **Logger hostname or IP address**
   - **Name of the SmartMessage receiver** (e.g., "SmartMessage Receiver")
   - **Port**: Configure the SmartConnector to use port 443/tcp for communication with a Logger Appliance, or the port configured for Software Logger.
   - **Unencrypted CEF syslog**: Enter the Logger hostname or IP address, the desired port, and choose UDP or TCP output.

For more information on configuring SmartConnectors, refer to the SmartConnector User's Guide and specific SmartConnector Configuration Guides, available from [ArcSight SmartConnectors](#).

#### Downloading SmartConnectors

Contact your Micro Focus ArcSight sales representative or customer support for the location to download the supported SmartConnectors. For more information on ArcSight SmartConnectors, visit [ArcSight SmartConnectors](#).

#### Devices

Logger begins storing events when an enabled receiver receives data or, in the case of file receivers, when the files become available. Using a process called autodiscovery, Logger automatically creates resources called devices to keep track of source IP addresses and uses DNS to map them to hostnames. You can also create devices preemptively by entering the IP addresses or hostnames of data sources that you expect to send events to Logger.

Discovered devices are named for their host, or if the DNS lookup fails, for their IP address and their receiver. For more information on creating devices, see the [Device Management Guide](#).

#### Device Groups

Device groups are containers or logical groupings for devices, similar to folders containing files. They are a name for a group of devices. A given device can be a member of several device groups. Each device group can be associated with a particular storage group, which assigns a retention policy. You can change and delete device groups freely as your needs change. For more details on setting up device groups, see the [Device Group Management Guide](#).

#### Storage Rules

Events are stored in the Default Storage Group unless otherwise specified. Storage rules direct events from certain device groups to specific storage groups, allowing you to implement additional retention policies. Storage rules are evaluated in order of priority; the first matching rule determines where the event is sent. This approach ensures that a single device can belong to several device groups without ambiguity about which storage group it will end up in. For more information, see the [Storage Rule Management Guide](#).

#### Sending Events from ArcSight ESM to Logger

The ArcSight Forwarding SmartConnector can read events from an ArcSight Manager and forward them to Logger as CEF-formatted syslog messages. For compatibility with Logger, use build 4810 or later.

To configure the ArcSight Forwarding SmartConnector to send events to Logger, follow these steps:

1. Install the SmartConnector component normally, but cancel the installation when the SmartConnector Wizard asks whether the target Manager uses a demo certificate.
2. Create a file called `agent.properties` in the directory `$ARCSIGHT_HOME/current/user/agent`, where `$ARCSIGHT_HOME` is the root directory where the SmartConnector component was installed. The file should contain the line:
   ```properties
   transport.default.type=cefsyslog
   ```
3. Start the SmartConnector configuration program again using the `$ARCSIGHT_HOME/current/bin/runagentsetup` script (or `arcsight agentsetup -w`).
4. Specify the required parameters for CEF output, including the Logger IP/host, port, and protocol (UDP or Raw TCP). These settings must match the receiver you create in Logger to listen for events from ArcSight ESM.

For more information on configuring the Forwarding SmartConnector, refer to the [Forwarding SmartConnector Configuration Guide](#).

### Alerts

You can configure Logger to alert you via email, SNMP trap, or Syslog message when a new event that matches a specific query is received or when a specified number of matches occur within a given time threshold. You can also view alerts through the Alert sub-menu under the Analyze tab. When an alert is triggered, Logger creates an alert event and sends a notification to the destinations you configured previously.

#### Types of Alerts

Logger provides two types of alerts:

- **Real-time Alerts**:
  - No limit on the number of alerts that can be defined.
  - A maximum of 25 alerts can be enabled at any time.
  - No limit on the number of configured email destinations, but only one SNMP, one Syslog, and one ESM destination can be set.
  - Alerts are triggered in real time when the specified number of matches occurs within the specified threshold.
  - Only regular expression queries can be specified for these alerts.

- **Saved Search Alerts**:
  - Any number of alerts can be defined, with a maximum of 50 alerts running concurrently.
  - No limit on the number of configured email destinations, but only one SNMP, one Syslog, and one ESM destination can be set.
  - Alerts are triggered at scheduled intervals when the specified number of matches occurs within the specified threshold.
  - Queries for these alerts are defined using the flow-based search language, which allows multiple search commands in a pipeline format, including regular expressions. Aggregation operators such as `chart` and `top` cannot be included in the search query.

To define a real-time alert, specify a query, match count, threshold, and one or more destinations. A time range is not associated with the queries, so an alert is triggered whenever the specified number of matches occurs within the specified threshold.

To define a Saved Search Alert, specify a Saved Search (which is a query with a time range), match count, threshold, and one or more destinations. A time range (within which events should be searched) is specified for the query associated with these alerts, so the specified number of matches within the specified threshold triggers the alert at the next scheduled interval.

For more information on alerts, refer to the [Alerts Management Guide](#).
