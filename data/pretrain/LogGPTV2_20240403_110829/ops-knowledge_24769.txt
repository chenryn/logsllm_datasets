Assistant: This log chunk shows the DataNode process responding to requests for blocks of data. It begins with two PacketResponders terminating, followed by a NameSystem adding a block to a blockMap and deleting two blocks from an invalidSet. The DataNode then serves blocks to various IP addresses, followed by two warnings of exceptions while serving blocks. Finally, the DataNode serves two more blocks.
