Summary: I can't import same python module from different path.
Any ideas? 0_o

Assistant: What's dns.__file__ in the first case?  I suspect it's not coming from the directory you cded into the second time (the current directory when you start Python goes at the front of sys.path) but rather from a package containing that crucial resolver module which the second one appears to be lacking.
