User: Previously I ran python 2.7 on Debian Linux terminal (bash). I conveniently use control-f, control-b to move forward/back word.
But it does not work on updated 3.4 version, which generates unreadable symbol.
Is there a way to configure the control-key recognition?
Assistant: If you compiled Python 3.4 from source, you are probably missing the development libraries for readline. The package is typically called libreadline-dev.
