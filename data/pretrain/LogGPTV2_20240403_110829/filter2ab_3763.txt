### Title: The Unbearable Lightness of BMCs

Welcome to the world of data centers, where the air conditioners hum incessantly and a mesmerizing dance of red and blue LEDs flicker in unison with the relentless whir of fans. It's a place that most people avoid like the plague. As one of the great leaders of our time once said, "Behind every need, there is a right" (or, in this case, a product).

Enter the realm of Out-of-Band (OOB) Power Management devices. These devices, often integrated into server motherboards, include an additional microprocessor that allows for remote monitoring and management of critical components such as heat, fans, and power. 

In our recent investigation into these OOB devices, we uncovered vulnerabilities that harken back to the 1990s. We found issues that enable 100% reliable remote code execution, allowing for bidirectional movement between the server and the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC). This not only provides a potent vector for lateral movement within a network but also serves as the perfect backdoor.

The implications of these findings are profound, highlighting the urgent need for robust security measures in data center infrastructure.
