dissimilar group with a significant difference of 21 seconds in the

grid key-decoy similarity, which is the similarity between a decoy 
image  and  a  non-collocated  key  image.  In  this  case  the  user

9.  CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper  we  explored  the  extent  to  which  the  process  of 
assembling  a  usable 
login  challenge  for  recognition-based 
graphical passwords based upon photographs could be automated 
using  image  processing  techniques.  In  our  tests  we  found  that 
using a color histogram as an image signature and computing the 
distance  between  those  histograms  using  the  Earth  Mover’s 
Distance  [30] provided a useful approach. In a short-term recall 
test with more than 300 people using Amazon Mechanical Turk, 
we  found  that  automated  choice  of  decoys  to  differing  levels  of 
visual  similarity  could  impact  the  number  of  errors  that  users 
made  at  login,  along  with  the  login  durations.  We  found 
significantly  fewer  errors  made  by  users  viewing  grids  with 
progressively  dissimilar  decoys  compared  to  those  viewing  the 
most  similar  decoys.  In  the  most significant case, we found that 
our automated decoy selection method could affect login success 
rates by 40%. This study illustrates that the performance benefits 
of recognition-based graphical passwords can be closely related to 
the chosen image sets.

collocated key image. Particularly conservative thresholds should 
be employed when considering this type of similarity. The remote 
scenario  places  success  rates  in  a  realistic  zone,  as  participants 
were  not  within  the  sphere  of  influence  of  experimenters.  Such 
results  have 
for  deployment  of 
recognition-based graphical passwords, as they serve to highlight 
the impact that seemingly subtle image choices can have upon the 
usability of the system.  
We also identified the security risks inherent in automated image 
filtering where this is not performed holistically. The approach to 
exhaustive filtering based upon similarity intervals appears to be 
the most secure approach, resistant to reverse engineering of the 
similarity  procedure  and  likely  to  be  useful  against  observation 
attacks. However, the benefits must be traded off against the size 
of the required image set. Questions of an optimal image choice 
appear  to  be  a  pressing  question  for  this  genre  of  graphical 
passwords.  However,  in  order  to  determine  any  benefits  had  by 
one  image  type  or  the  other,  it  is  necessary  to  carry  out 
longitudinal  studies  that  compare  image  types  with  differing 
levels  of  entropy  and  similarity  involved.  Recent  work  has 
compared objects and faces and questioned the superiority of face 
images [15]. 
The  results  have  implications  for  graphical  password  systems  of 
all  genres.  This  work  has  focused  upon  recognition-based 
graphical  passwords  where  there  are  multiple  grids  and  one  key 
image on each screen. However, our taxonomy of image filtering 
is relevant to systems where images are static for all users, or for 
configurations where key images are randomly distributed across 
the  grids  [5,13].  The  results  also  have  implications  for  other 
systems  such  as  Passpoints  [41],  where  future  research  could 
focus  upon  some  notion  of  similarity  between  images  to  predict 
whether similar user choices could be expected between a number 
of  images.  Recent  work  correctly  asserts  that  alternatives  to 
alphanumeric  passwords  have  so  far  failed  to  make  an  impact 
[14], juxtaposing novel mechanisms with alphanumeric passwords 
or PINs in terms of flexibility and convenience usually results in 
failure. The challenge for alternative authentication solutions is to 
demonstrate evidence of new types of value that impact the trade-
off between security, usability, deployability, and convenience.  In 
recent  work  [23]  we  made  initial  investigations  how  image 
similarity could impact observation attack and description in the 
context of a novel recognition-based graphical password system. 
Future  work  exploring  automated  image  choice  could  help 
graphical passwords to provide such added value.
