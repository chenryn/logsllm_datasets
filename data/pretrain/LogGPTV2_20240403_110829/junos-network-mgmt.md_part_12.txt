Junos OS provides enhancements to trigger faster protection-switching and convergence in the event of
failures in Ethernet domains for Carrier Ethernet services. These enhancements can be used when CE
devices in the Ethernet domain detect faster service failures and propagates the information in the
interface-status TLV of the continuity-check messages (CCMs). When CCMs are received, PE devices
can perform certain actions which facilitates faster protection-switching and convergence. You can
configure CCM for better scalability using the information provided in this topic.
Configure Faster Protection Switching for Point-to-Point Network Topologies
You can apply an action profile to provide faster protection switching for point-to-point network
topologies with local switching configured. In a normal state, CCM sessions are configured on the
working and protect interfaces. The CCM packets transmitted contain an interface-status TLV with the
value up on the working interface and value down on the protect interface. When a link fails on the
working interface, the protect interface starts receiving the interface-status TLV as up. With the profile
configuration, if the interface-status TLV received on the protect interface is up, the working interface is
automatically marked as interface-down.
To configure the interface-status-tlv down event, include the interface-status-tlv down statement at the
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name event] hierarchy level.
To configure interface-down as the action profile’s action, include the interface-down statement at the [edit
protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name action] hierarchy level.
To configure peer-interface as the clear-action, include peer-interface at the [edit protocols oam ethernet
connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name clear-action] hierarchy level.
[edit protocols oam]

connectivity-fault-management {

event {
interface-status-tlv down;
}
action {
interface-down;
}
clear-action {
interface-down peer-interface;
109
}
}
}
}
In this action profile configuration, when the interface-status TLV is received as up, the peer-interface is
marked as down.
The peer-interface is configured in the protect-maintenance-association statement. Consider the following
example using the protect-maintenance-association statement in the configuration:
[edit protocols oam]
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
action-profile p1 {

Configure Faster Convergence for Dual-Homed Multipoint-to-Multipoint Network
Topologies
You can apply an action profile to provide faster convergence for dual-homed multipoint-to-multipoint
network topologies. If a multipoint-to-multipoint Ethernet service uses MAC-based forwarding and stale
MAC addresses exist in the learning tables, this can result in traffic black holes in the network where
incoming traffic is silently discarded, without informing the source that the data did not reach its
intended recipient. With the profile configuration, if the interface-status TLV received on the protect
interface is up, then the interface-status TLV on the working interface is marked as down and the PE
device for the protect interface propagates a remote MAC-flush message to the PE devices in the virtual
private LAN service (VPLS) by using TLDP-MAC-FLUSH. The MAC flush avoids null-route filtering due
to stale mac-db entries.
To configure the interface-status-tlv down event, include the interface-status-tlv down statement at the
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name event] hierarchy level.
To configure propagate-remote-flush as the action profile’s action, include the propagate-remote-flush
statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name action]
hierarchy level.
111
To configure propagate-remote-flush as the clear-action, include the propagate-remote-flush statement at the
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management action-profile profile-name clear-action] hierarchy
level.
[edit protocols oam]
ethernet {
connectivity-fault-management {
action-profile test {
event {
interface-status-tlv down;
}
action {
propagate-remote-mac-flush;
}
clear-action {
propagate-remote-mac-flush;
}
}
}
}
In this action profile configuration, when the incoming CCM packet contains the interface-status TLV
with value down, the propagate-remote-mac-flush action is triggered for the action-profile.

Configure a Primary VLAN ID for Increased Flexibility
You can assign a primary virtual LAN (VLAN) ID in the maintenance association for increased flexibility
in the number of tags. When a vlan-range or vlan-id-list is configured on an interface, the service OAM
must run on one of the VLANs. The VLAN assigned for service monitoring is considered the primary
VLAN. If a primary-vid is not configured, Junos OS assigns the first VLAN from the vlan-range or vlan-id-
list. In earlier releases, Junos OS assigned VLAN 4095.
112
To configure a primary VLAN ID, you can specify the primary-vid statement at the [edit protocols oam
ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name maintenance-association ma-name] hierarchy
level:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
maintenance domain md3 {
level 3;
maintenance-association ma3 {
primary-vid 2000;
continuity-check {
interval 10ms;
connection-protection-tlv;
}

Configure a Remote Maintenance Association to Accept a Different ID
You can configure a maintenance association to accept a different maintenance association identifier (ID)
from a neighbor by including a remote-maintenance-association statement. The 802.1ag CCM sessions
expect the same maintenance association identifier from its neighbors. If there is a maintenance
association identifier mismatch, the PDUs are marked as error PDUs. If a remote-maintenance-association
statement is configured, a different maintenance association identifier is accepted and the 802.1ag CCM
sessions do not mark the CCM PDUs as error PDUs when the maintenance-association name is the
same as the name specified in the remote-maintenance-association statement.
113
To configure a remote maintenance association, include the remote-maintenance-association statement at the
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management maintenance-domain domain-name maintenance-association
ma-name] hierarchy level:
[edit protocols oam ethernet connectivity-fault-management]
maintenance domain md3 {
level 1;
maintenance-association ma3 {
remote-maintenance-association fix-ma;
continuity-check {
interval 10ms;
connection-protection-tlv;
}
mep 2 {
interface ge-2/2/0.0;
direction up;
auto-discovery;
}
}
}
Using this configuration, interoperability is improved for CCMs with low-end CE devices supporting
fixed maintenance association identifier configurations.

Overview | 114
Configuration | 114
This example shows the configuration of Ethernet connectivity fault management (CFM) on physical
interfaces.
Requirements
This example uses the following hardware and software components:
• Junos OS Release 9.3 or later.
Overview
CFM can be used to monitor the physical link between two routers. This functionality is similar to that
supported by the IEEE 802.3ah LFM protocol.
In Junos OS Release 9.3 and later, CFM also supports aggregated Ethernet interfaces. On interfaces
configured on Modular Port Concentrators (MPCs) and Modular Interface Cards (MICs) on MX Series
routers, CFM is not supported on untagged aggregated Ethernet member links. MPCs and MICs do
support CFM on untagged and tagged aggregated Ethernet logical interfaces.
NOTE: The configurations in this example are only partial examples of complete and functional
router configurations. Do not copy these configurations and use them directly on an actual
system.

In the following example, two routers (Router 1 and Router 2) are connected by a point-to-point Gigabit
Ethernet link. The link between these two routers is monitored using CFM. This is shown in Figure 10 on
page 115. The single boundary is a “down mep” in CFM terminology.
Figure 10: Ethernet CFM on Physical Interfaces
To configure Ethernet CFM on physical interfaces, perform these tasks:

Example: Configure Ethernet CFM on Bridge Connections
In this example, both the customer and service provider are running Ethernet CFM over a simple bridge
network. The network is shown in Figure 11 on page 117. The customer has configured Ethernet CFM
on MX Series routers L2-CE1 and L2-CE2. The service provider has configured Ethernet CFM on MX
Series routers PE1 and PE2.
NOTE: The configurations in this example are only partial examples of complete and functional
router configurations. Do not copy these configurations and use them directly on an actual
system.
The service provider is using CFM level 3 for the link between PE1 and PE2 and level 5 from one CE
facing port to the other. The customer is using CFM level 7. The boundaries are marked with “up mep”
and “down mep” CFM terminology in the figure.
