Ansible will automatically configure the server based on the tasks you define in the playbook. To quickly deploy the same configuration on multiple servers, follow these steps: 1. Write Ansible playbooks: Use Ansible playbooks to write automated configuration information. Make sure that in these playbooks you define tasks to be executed on multiple servers. 2. Write the Ansible host list file: define the target server information for automatic management in the host list file. Make sure these servers have the same configuration. 3. Run the Ansible playbook: Use the ansible-playbook command to run the Ansible playbook and apply it to multiple servers. Ansible will automatically perform the same tasks on each server and configure the servers to meet the defined requirements. With these steps, you can use Ansible for automated configuration management and quickly deploy the same configuration on multiple servers. This saves time and ensures that servers are always configured according to defined standards.
