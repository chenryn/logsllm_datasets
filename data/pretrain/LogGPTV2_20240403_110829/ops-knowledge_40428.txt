User: I'm developing a web application and considering Django, Google App Engine, and several other options. I wondered what kind of "penalty" I will incur if I develop a complete Django application assuming it runs on a dedicated server, and then later want to migrate it to Google App Engine.
I have a basic understanding of Google's data store, so please assume I will choose a column based database for my "stand-alone" Django application rather than a relational database, so that the schema could remain mostly the same and will not be a major factor.
Also, please assume my application does not maintain a huge amount of data, so that migration of tens of gigabytes is not required. I'm mainly interested in the effects on the code and software architecture.
Thanks
Assistant: There are a few things that you can't do on the App Engine that you can do on your own server like uploading of files. On the App Engine you kinda have to upload it and store the datastore which can cause a few problems.
Other than that it should be fine from the Presentation part. There are a number of other little things that are better on your own dedicated server but I think eventually a lot of those things will be in the App Engine
