### Evaluation of Rejuvenation with Live Migration in Cloud Environments

#### A. Model Parameters
The Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) and Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) models are constructed and evaluated using the SHARPE [18] and TimeNET [15] tools, respectively. The parameters used in the RBD models are detailed in Table I, while those for the SPN models are listed in Table II. Given the difficulty in obtaining dependability rates through experimentation, all values in this study are derived from established research [19, 20].

**Table I: RBD Parameters**
| Component | MTTF (hours) | MTTR (minutes) |

| MigrationTime   | Time to live migrate a VM | 0.00011         |
| RejuvenationNode | Time to rejuvenate Node | 0.5             |

#### B. Evaluation of Scenarios
The evaluation of the scenarios is based on two key factors: the rejuvenation policy and the Time To Aging Related Failure (TTARF). Five scenarios with different TTARFs were created, and in each scenario, the time interval to trigger rejuvenation varied from 1 hour to 720 hours, using sampling. These values represent the mean interval between migrations.

**Table III: Scenario Definitions**
| Scenario | TTARF (hours) | Aging 1st Phase (hours) | Aging 2nd, 3rd Phases (hours) |
|----------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1        | 100           | 66.667                  | 16.667                         |
| 2        | 250           | 333.333                 | 41.667                         |
| 3        | 500           | 666.667                 | 83.333                         |
| 4        | 750           | 1000                    | 125                            |
| 5        | 1000          | 1666.667                | 166.667                        |

For each scenario, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rejuvenation policies on steady-state availability. The results are presented in Figure 4, which includes a baseline availability from a model without rejuvenation policies. In most scenarios and policies, the system with rejuvenation achieved higher availability than the system without it. The optimal rejuvenation policy for each scenario is identified in Table IV.

**Table IV: Results from Model Analysis**
| Scenario | Rejuvenation Policy (hours) | Steady-State Availability | Downtime (min/yr) |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| 1        | 1                           | 0.9961765                 | 2009.6             |
| 2        | 6                           | 0.9965244                 | 1826.7             |
| 3        | 6                           | 0.9966707                 | 1749.8             |
| 4        | 12                          | 0.996714                  | 1727.1             |
| 5        | 12                          | 0.9967297                 | 1718.8             |

To further illustrate the impact of the proposed rejuvenation, we calculated two additional metrics: the percentage gain in availability and the reduction in downtime. The percentage gain in availability is shown in Figure 5, and the reduction in downtime is depicted in Figure 6. Both figures use the time interval to trigger rejuvenation as the X-axis, with a maximum limit of 720 hours.

**Figure 5: Improvement in Availability in Each Scenario**

**Figure 6: Downtime Reduction (min/yr)**

These plots demonstrate the direct impact of rejuvenation trigger intervals on system availability. For example, in Scenario 1, which has the smallest TTARF, the proper rejuvenation trigger interval can avoid approximately 78 hours of downtime per year. As the trigger interval varies, the steady-state availability changes, but in slightly different ways for each scenario. There is an optimal schedule for each scenario, and too frequent migrations can degrade system availability.

### Conclusions and Future Work
We have presented a comprehensive availability model using RBD and SPN for a cloud system with VMM rejuvenation supported by live migration. The models enable the selection of appropriate rejuvenation policies for different scenarios, resulting in significant improvements in steady-state availability. The results show that the rejuvenation mechanism supported by live migration is beneficial across various workloads. For systems under heavy workloads, where aging is faster, live migration rejuvenation can significantly improve availability with the correct rejuvenation schedule. However, when the rejuvenation trigger interval is large, the steady-state availability tends to return to the value of the system without rejuvenation. Additionally, intense migration activity may not always be appropriate for improving availability.

In future work, we plan to study more scenarios with different types of workloads and include the aging characteristics of other components in the availability models. We also intend to conduct sensitivity analyses on other model parameters, not just the rejuvenation trigger.
