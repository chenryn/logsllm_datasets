### Title: Black Hat EU-18: Developments and Challenges in Cybersecurity from the Nation-State Perspective

Eleven years ago, Estonia became the first country to experience politically motivated cyber-attacks. Since then, the landscape of cybersecurity has transformed dramatically. Cyber-attacks have become a new norm, targeting not only states but also companies and individual citizens on a global and massive scale. These attacks now even challenge the very political independence of nations.

Despite these challenges, there have been positive developments. Awareness about cybersecurity has increased significantly compared to 2007. The topic is now discussed at various forums, from international organizations to secondary schools. However, many critical questions remain unanswered and are as relevant today as they were in 2007. These include the applicability of international law, state responsibility for non-state actors' actions, attribution, defensive and offensive capabilities, and international cooperation. Additionally, the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders continue to be a topic of debate.

In his keynote address at Black Hat USA 2017, Alex Stamos highlighted the importance of social skills and diversity in the field of cybersecurity. He emphasized the urgent need to include individuals with diverse backgrounds, education, and cultures. This inclusivity is essential both at the company level and on a broader, national, and international scale.

States play a unique role in providing security, including cybersecurity, and in applying and interpreting international law. However, their ability to do so effectively is limited. Despite their traditional dominance over national and international security, states cannot manage the complexities of cyberspace alone. The internet is governed by a complex system of stakeholders, and governments alone cannot dictate all aspects of cyberspace. In this ecosystem, the private sector owns nearly all digital and physical assets, the industry develops and provides online services, and civil society and academia contribute to research and act as watchdogs of democracy.

The keynote will address the lessons learned from the 2007 cyber-attacks, the challenges we face in 2018/2019, and the roles of states and other stakeholders. It will also discuss developments in international cooperation and propose ideas for the future. Additionally, the keynote will introduce the work of the Global Commission on Stability in Cyberspace (GCSC) as an example of a multi-stakeholder model that contributes to international discussions and policy-making.
