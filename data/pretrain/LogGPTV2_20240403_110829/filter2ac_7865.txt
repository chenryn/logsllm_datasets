### Title: BlackHat US-22: BrokenMesh - New Attack Surfaces of Bluetooth Mesh

**Abstract:**

Bluetooth Mesh is a mesh networking standard based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), introduced by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) in 2017. This technology facilitates many-to-many device communications and is optimized for large-scale device networks, making it ideal for smart home, industrial, and other IoT applications. Despite its widespread adoption by major chip manufacturers, the security of Bluetooth Mesh implementations has often been overlooked.

In this presentation, we will delve into the Bluetooth Mesh protocol, breaking down the mesh process into two key stages: network build and network control. We will focus on the security implications of these stages and present an automated fuzzing tool, "BLE Mesh Fuzzer," designed to identify vulnerabilities in both stages. Our evaluation of BLE Mesh Fuzzer across eight well-known vendors and open-source projects revealed 17 memory corruption vulnerabilities, resulting in nine Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Some of these vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution without user interaction, potentially causing the collapse of the entire mesh network and affecting millions of IoT devices.

Additionally, we will discuss our findings on the security of protocol wrapper applications, where we identified ten vulnerabilities in a prominent vendor's implementation, leading to ten CVEs. These vulnerabilities can result in serious consequences such as privilege escalation.
