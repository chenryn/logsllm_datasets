**ATT&CK ID:** M1040  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Behavior Prevention on Endpoint

**Description:**
On Windows 10, enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to prevent Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) attacks and the spawning of child processes from Office applications. This can be achieved by configuring the following ASR rules:

- **Block Office applications from creating child processes:** This rule prevents Office applications from launching other processes, which can help mitigate certain types of malware that attempt to execute malicious code via Office documents.
- **Block DDE client requests to the Windows Command Processor and PowerShell:** This rule blocks DDE attacks, which are often used to execute arbitrary commands or scripts.

For detailed instructions on how to enable these ASR rules, refer to the official Microsoft documentation [6][7].
