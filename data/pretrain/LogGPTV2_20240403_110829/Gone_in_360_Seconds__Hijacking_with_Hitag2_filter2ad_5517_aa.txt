cording to European directive 95/56/EC. Similar regula-
tions apply to other countries like Australia, New Zeal-
and (AS/NZS 4601:1999) and Canada (CAN/ULC S338-
98). An electronic car immobilizer consists of two main
components: a small transponder chip which is embed-
ded in (the plastic part of) the car key, see Figure 1; and
a reader which is located somewhere in the dashboard of
the vehicle and has an antenna coil around the ignition,
see Figure 2.

The transponder is a passive RFID tag that operates at a
low frequency wave of 125 kHz. It is powered up when
it comes in proximity range of the electronic ﬁeld of the
reader. When the transponder is absent, the immobilizer
unit prevents the vehicle from starting the engine.
Abstract
An electronic vehicle immobilizer is an anti-theft device
which prevents the engine of the vehicle from starting
unless the corresponding transponder is present. Such a
transponder is a passive RFID tag which is embedded in
the car key and wirelessly authenticates to the vehicle.
It prevents a perpetrator from hot-wiring the vehicle or
starting the car by forcing the mechanical lock. Having
such an immobilizer is required by law in several coun-
tries. Hitag2, introduced in 1996, is currently the most
widely used transponder in the car immobilizer industry.
It is used by at least 34 car makes and ﬁtted in more
than 200 different car models. Hitag2 uses a propriet-
ary stream cipher with 48-bit keys for authentication and
conﬁdentiality. This article reveals several weaknesses
in the design of the cipher and presents three practical at-
tacks that recover the secret key using only wireless com-
munication. The most serious attack recovers the secret
key from a car in less than six minutes using ordinary
hardware. This attack allows an adversary to bypass the
cryptographic authentication, leaving only the mechan-
ical key as safeguard. This is even more sensitive on
vehicles where the physical key has been replaced by a
keyless entry system based on Hitag2. During our exper-
iments we managed to recover the secret key and start the
engine of many vehicles from various makes using our
transponder emulating device. These experiments also
revealed several implementation weaknesses in the im-
mobilizer units.
1 Introduction
In the past, most cars relied only on mechanical keys to
prevent a hijacker from stealing the vehicle. Since the
’90s most car manufacturers incorporated an electronic
car immobilizer as an extra security mechanism in their
vehicles. From 1995 it is mandatory that all cars sold in
the EU are ﬁtted with such an immobilizer device, ac-
Figure 2: Immobilizer unit around the ignition barrel
A distinction needs to be made with remotely operated
central locking system, which opens the doors, is bat-
tery powered, operates at a ultra-high frequency (UHF)
of 433 MHz, and only activates when the user pushes a
1
button on the remote key. More recent car keys are of-
ten deployed with a hybrid chip that supports the battery
powered ultra-high frequency as well as the passive low
frequency communication interface.
With the Hitag2 family of transponders, its manu-
facturer NXP Semiconductors (formerly Philips Semi-
conductors) leads the immobilizer market [34]. Fig-
ure 4 shows a list containing some of the vehicles that
are deployed with a Hitag2 transponder. Even though
NXP boosts “Unbreakable security levels using mutual
authentication, challenge-response and encrypted data
communication”1, it uses a shared key of only 48 bits.
Since 1988, the automotive industry has moved to-
wards the so-called keyless ignition or keyless entry in
their high-end vehicles [26]. In such a vehicle the mech-
anical key is no longer present and it has been replaced
by a start button like the one shown in Figure 3. The only
anti-theft mechanism left in these vehicles is the immob-
ilizer. Startlingly, many keyless ignition or entry vehicles
sold nowadays are still based on the Hitag2 cipher. In
some keyless entry cars Hitag2 is also used as a backup
mechanism for opening the doors, e.g., when the battery
of the remote is depleted.

Related work
A similar immobilizer transponder is produced by Texas
Instruments under the name Digital Signature Transpon-
der (DST). It is protected by a different proprietary cryp-
tographic algorithm that uses a secret key of only 40 bits.
The workings of these algorithms are reversed engin-
eered by Bono et al.
in [10]. Francillon et al. demon-
strated in [18] that is possible to relay in real-time the
(encrypted) communication of several keyless entry sys-
tems. The article shows that in some cases such a com-
munication can be intercepted over a distance of at least
100 meters.

Figure 4: Vehicles using Hitag2 [29] – boldface indicates
vehicles we tested
The history of the NXP Hitag2 family of transpon-
ders overlaps with that of other security products de-
signed and deployed in the late nineties, such as Kee-
loq [8, 13, 27, 28], MIFARE Classic [12, 19, 22, 35],
CryptoMemory [4, 5, 23] or iClass [20, 21]. Originally,
information on Hitag2 transponders was limited to data
sheets with high level descriptions of the chip’s function-
ality [36], while details on the proprietary cryptographic
algorithms were kept secret by the manufacturer. This
phase, in which security was strongly based on obscur-
ity, lasted until in 2007 when the Hitag2 inner workings
were reverse engineered [47]. Similarly to its prede-
cessor Crypto1 (used in MIFARE Classic), the Hitag2
cipher consists of a 48 bit Linear Feedback Shift Register
(LFSR) and a non-linear ﬁlter function used to output
keystream. The publication of the Hitag2 cipher attrac-
ted the interest of the scientiﬁc community. Courtois et
al. [14] were the ﬁrst to study the strength of the Hitag2
stream cipher to algebraic attacks by transforming the
cipher state into a system of equations and using SAT
solvers to perform key recovery attacks. Their most prac-
tical attack requires two days computation and a total of
four eavesdropped authentication attempts to extract the
secret key. A more efﬁcient attack, requiring 16 chosen
initialization vectors (IV) and six hours of computations,
was also proposed. However, and as noted by the au-
thors themselves, chosen-IV attacks are prevented by the
Hitag2 authentication protocol (see Sect. 3.5), thus mak-
ing this attack unfeasible in practice.
In [42], Soos et al. introduced a series of optimizations
on SAT solvers that made it possible to reduce the attack
time of Curtois et al. to less than 7 hours. More recently,
ˇStembera and Novotn´y [45] implemented a brute-force
attack that could be carried out in less than two hours by
using the COPACOBANA2 high-performance cluster of
FPGAs. Note however, that such attack would require
about 4 years if carried out on a standard PC. Finally,
Sun et. al [44] tested the security of the Hitag2 cipher
against cube attacks. Although according to their results
the key can be recovered in less than a minute, this attack
requires chosen initialization vectors and thus should be
regarded as strictly theoretical.
Our contribution
In this paper, we show a number of vulnerabilities in the
Hitag2 transponders that enable an adversary to retrieve
the secret key. We propose three attacks that extract the
secret key under different scenarios. We have implemen-
ted and successfully executed these attacks in practice on
more than 20 vehicles of various make and model. On all
these vehicles we were able to use an emulating device
to bypass the immobilizer and start the vehicle.
Concretely, we found the following vulnerabilities in
Hitag2.
• The transponder lacks a pseudo-random number
generator, which makes the authentication proced-
2http://www.copacobana.org
ure vulnerable to replay attacks. Moreover, the
transponder provides known data when a read com-
mand is issued on the block where the transponder’s
identity is stored, allowing to recover keystream.
Redundancy in the commands allow an adversary
to expand this keystream to arbitrary lengths. This
means that the transponder provides an arbitrary
length keystream oracle.
• With probability 1/4 the output bit of the cipher is
determined by only 34 bits of the internal state. As
a consequence, (on average) one out of four authen-
tication attempts leaks one bit of information about
the secret key.
• The 48 bit internal state of the cipher is only ran-
domized by a nonce of 32 bits. This means that 16
bits of information over the secret key are persistent
throughout different sessions.
We exploit these vulnerabilities in the following three
practical attacks.
• The ﬁrst attack exploits the malleability of the
cipher and the fact that the transponder does not
have a pseudo-random number generator. It uses a
keystream shifting attack following the lines of [16].
This allows an adversary to ﬁrst get an authentica-
tion attempt from the reader which can later be re-
played to the transponder. Exploiting the malleab-
ility of the cipher, this can be used to read known
plaintext (the identity of the transponder) and re-
cover keystream. In a new session the adversary can
use this keystream to read any other memory block
(with exception of the secret key when conﬁgured
correctly) within milliseconds. When the key is not
read protected, this attack can also be used to read
the secret key. This was in fact the case for most
vehicles we tested from a French car make.
• The second attack is slower but more general in
the sense that the same attack strategy can be ap-
plied to other LFSR based ciphers. The attack uses
a time/memory tradeoff as proposed in [3, 6, 7,
11, 25, 38]. Exploiting the linear properties of the
LFSR, we are able to efﬁciently generate the lookup
table, reducing the complexity from 248 to 237 en-
cryptions. This attack recovers the secret key re-
gardless of the read protection conﬁguration of the
transponder. It requires 30 seconds of communica-
tion with the transponder and another 30 seconds to
perform 2000 table lookups.
• The third attack is also the most powerful, as it only
requires a few authentication attempts from the car
immobilizer to recover the secret key (assuming that
3
the adversary knows a valid transponder id). This
cryptanalytic attack exploits dependencies among
different sessions and a low degree determination
of the ﬁlter function used in the cipher. In order to
execute this attack, an adversary ﬁrst gathers 136
partial authentication attempts from the car. This
can be done within one minute. Then, the adversary
needs to perform 235 operations to recover the secret
key. This takes less than ﬁve minutes on an ordinary
laptop.
Furthermore, besides looking into the security aspects of
Hitag2 we also study how it is deployed and integrated
in car immobilizer systems by different manufacturers.
Our study reveals that in many vehicles the transponder
is misconﬁgured by having readable or default keys, and
predictable passwords, whereas the immobilizer unit em-
ploys weak pseudo-random number generators. All cars
we tested use identiﬁer white-listing as an additional se-
curity mechanism. This means that in order to use our
third attack to hijack a car, an adversary ﬁrst needs to
eavesdrop, guess or wirelessly pickpocket a legitimate
transponder id, see Section 7.5.
Following the principle of responsible disclosure, we
have contacted the manufacturer NXP and informed
them of our ﬁndings six months ahead of publication.
We have also provided our assistance in compiling a doc-
ument to inform their customers about these vulnerabil-
ities. The communication with NXP has been friendly
and constructive. NXP encourages the automotive in-
dustry for years to migrate to more secure products that
incorporate strong and community-reviewed ciphers like
AES [15]. It is surprising that the automotive industry
is reluctant to migrate to secure products given the cost
difference of a better chip (≤ 1 USD) in relation to the
prices of high-end car models (≥ 50,000 USD).
