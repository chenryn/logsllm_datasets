### Analysis of Diurnal Patterns and Connection Behavior in P2P, Web, and Malicious Traffic

#### Diurnal Patterns
Peer-to-peer (P2P) and malicious connections do not exhibit any diurnal patterns. However, within web traffic, unsuccessful connection attempts consistently account for around 17.5% throughout the day, with a notable drop to 10% during nighttime hours (around 2 AM). This phenomenon can be attributed to the rarity of HTTP connections during these hours, which makes the statistical analysis more sensitive to the behavior of individual applications or user groups.

#### Non-Established Connections
Non-established TCP connections have been categorized into three types: 
1. **Connection attempts with one SYN packet only**
2. **Attempts with direct RST replies**
3. **Asymmetrical traffic**

Due to transit traffic and hot-potato routing, 13% of the connections are asymmetrically routed, making it impossible to observe a complete three-way handshake.

**Figure 3. Breakdown of non-established TCP connections**

None of the traffic classes show significant diurnal patterns for non-established TCP connections. However, Figure 3 highlights major differences between the three traffic classes:
- **Web Traffic:** The small fraction of non-established web traffic (16.3% of all traffic) is primarily due to asymmetrical traffic, with real unsuccessful connection attempts being very rare.
- **Malicious Traffic:** This category is dominated by single SYN packet flows.
- **P2P Traffic:** Single SYN flows are also predominant in non-established P2P connections. The percentage of such connection attempts increased from 71% in April to 79% in November, contributing to the rise in non-established P2P connections observed in Figure 2. The trend of increasing one-SYN connections within P2P flows is noteworthy, with a 23% increase (from 35% to 43%) over an 8-month period.

#### Established Connections
Established connections are analyzed based on their termination behavior, as shown in Figure 4. The following termination behaviors were observed:
1. **Proper closing with one FIN in each direction or only one RST packet** (as per TCP standards)
2. **Connections closed by FIN, followed by an additional RST packet** (in both client and server directions)
3. **Unclosed connections** (not closed during the measurement interval)

**Figure 4. Breakdown of established TCP connections**

- **Web Traffic:** Termination of web connections does not show significant trends or diurnal patterns. HTTP connections are properly closed in 75% of cases, with another 15% closed by RST packets, often due to irregular web-server and browser implementations.
- **P2P Traffic:** There is a significant change in the termination behavior of P2P connections from spring to fall 2006. In April, slightly less than half of the P2P connections were closed properly with two FINs, while 20% were terminated with FIN plus an additional RST packet sent by the server. By fall, the fraction of FIN+RST terminations by the responder was reduced to around 8%, with an increase in valid TCP terminations (2xFIN and single RST). This change is likely due to updates in P2P software or a shift in user preferences towards better-behaving software.

#### TCP Option Deployment
The deployment of the most popular TCP options (TS, MSS, SACK, WS) during connection establishment has been investigated for P2P and web traffic (Table 1).

**Table 1. Differences in TCP Option Deployment**

| **Option** | **P2P Connections** | **HTTP Connections** |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **TS**     | 99.9% estab., 0.1% neglected, 0.0% none | 99.6% estab., 0.4% neglected, 0.0% none |
| **MSS**    | 91.0% estab., 6.5% neglected, 2.5% none | 65.7% estab., 27.9% neglected, 6.4% none |
| **SACK**   | 14.9% estab., 0.6% neglected, 84.5% none | 16.0% estab., 4.3% neglected, 79.7% none |
| **WS**     | 8.8% estab., 1.0% neglected, 90.2% none | 13.4% estab., 4.3% neglected, 82.3% none |

- **P2P Traffic:** Option usage is consistent, with minimal neglect and no diurnal or longitudinal trends. The MSS option is almost fully deployed, and the SACK permitted option is commonly proposed but neglected in only 6.5% of cases.
- **Web Traffic:** The MSS option is less consistently deployed, with 28% of web connections neglecting SACK support. The WS and TS options are established more often within web traffic, but there is a higher rate of neglect compared to P2.P traffic.

#### Summary and Conclusions
This study analyzed aggregated backbone traffic collected during two campaigns in spring and fall 2006. The data was summarized on a flow level and classified into P2P, web, and malicious traffic. Key findings include:
- **Traffic Volumes:** Overall traffic volumes are increasing, with peak activities in the evenings. P2P traffic dominates with 90% of the transfer volumes, especially during evening and night times, while HTTP traffic peaks during office hours.
- **Malicious Traffic:** Malicious and attack traffic is responsible for a substantial part of all TCP and UDP flows but plays a minor role in data volumes. The fraction of malicious flows remained constant despite the overall increase in traffic volumes.
- **Connection Signaling Behavior:** Major differences were observed between the three traffic classes. The number of unsuccessful P2P connection attempts increased, indicating a pronounced "elephants and mice" phenomenon within P2P flow sizes.
- **TCP Option Deployment:** Significant differences were found between P2P and web traffic. P2P traffic reflects expected behavior based on default settings in popular operating systems, while web traffic shows artifacts of traditional client-server communication, with some web-servers neglecting certain TCP options.

These results provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners, offering detailed knowledge about trends and influences of different traffic classes in current Internet traffic.
