User: Anaconda for python 3.5 and python 2.7 seems to install just as a drop in folder inside my home folder on Ubuntu.  Is there an installed version of Anaconda for Ubuntu 16?  I'm not sure how to ask this but do I need python 3.5 that comes by default if I am also using Anaconda 3.5?  
It seems like the best solution is docker these days.  I mean I understand virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.  However, sometimes I try to indicate in my .bashrc that I want to use python 3.5 and yet I'll use the command mkvirtualenv and it will start installing the python 2.7 versions of python.  
Should I choose either Anaconda or the version of python installed with my OS from python.org or is there an easy way to manage many different versions of Python?
Thanks,
Bruce
Assistant: Use anaconda version Anaconda3-4.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh from the anaconda installer archive.This comes with python 3.5. This worked for me.
