focus on threshold issuance or on general purpose credentials,
and showing credentials requires expensive double discrete-
logarithm proofs.
Coconut addresses these challenges, and allows a subset of
decentralized mutually distrusting authorities to jointly issue
credentials, on public or private attributes. Those credentials
cannot be forged by users, or any small subset of potentially
corrupt authorities. Credentials can be re-randomized before
selected attributes are shown to a veriﬁer, protecting privacy
even in the case in which all authorities and veriﬁers collude.
The Coconut scheme is based on a threshold issuance signature
scheme that allows partial claims to be aggregated into a
single credential. Mapped to the context of permissioned and
semi-permissioned blockchains, Coconut allows collections of
authorities in charge of maintaining a blockchain, or a side
chain [3] based on a federated peg, to jointly issue selective
disclosure credentials.
Coconut uses short and computationally efﬁcient creden-
tials, and efﬁcient revelation of selected attributes and veriﬁ-
cation protocols. Each partial credential and the consolidated
credential is composed of exactly two group elements. The size
of the credential remains constant regardless of the number
of attributes or authorities/issuers. Furthermore, after a one-
time setup phase where the users collect and aggregate a
threshold number of veriﬁcation keys from the authorities,
the attribute showing and veriﬁcation are O(1) in terms of
both cryptographic computations and communication of cryp-
tographic material—irrespective of the number of authorities.
Our evaluation of the Coconut primitives shows very promising
results. Veriﬁcation takes about 10ms, while signing a private
attribute is about 3 times faster. The latency is about 600
ms when the client aggregates partial credentials from 10
authorities distributed across the world.
Contribution. This paper makes three key contributions:
users to generate a consolidated credential [8]. The com-
munication complexity of the request and issue protocol is
thus O(t), where t is the size of the subset of authorities.
