# Environment
    Windows build number: 19008.vb
    Windows Terminal version 0.6.2951.0
    Any other software?
# Steps to reproduce
Launching a new tab is done via CTRL+SHIFT+  
I remap my Caps Lock key to CTRL via remapkey utility which just changes a
registry key somewhere. This behavior works _everywhere_ except for the
Terminal app.
# Expected behavior
Windows Terminal respects my remapped key, i.e., Caps Lock + Shift + launches
a new tab.
# Actual behavior
Caps Lock + Shift + does not launch a new tab
