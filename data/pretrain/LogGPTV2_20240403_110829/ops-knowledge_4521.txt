Subject: Seeking IDE with Code Completion for IronPython on Linux

Dear Support Team,

I have been searching for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports code completion (IntelliSense) for IronPython on Linux systems, particularly Ubuntu. During my research, I came across references to MonoDevelop and Eclipse (with the PyDev plugin) as potential options. However, I have not been able to get either of these IDEs to work properly with IronPython.

Could you confirm whether MonoDevelop and PyDev only support IronPython code completion on Windows? If they do support it on Linux, are there any detailed installation guides or tutorials available that I could follow to set up these IDEs on Ubuntu?

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,
Chris

Assistant: Thank you for reaching out, Chris.

While JetBrains PyCharm is a highly recommended IDE for Python development, it may not natively support IronPython. For your specific needs, here are a few suggestions:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: VS Code is a versatile and highly extensible editor. You can use the `ironpython` extension, which provides some level of support for IronPython. Additionally, the `Pylance` or `Microsoft Python Language Server` extensions might offer better code completion and other features.

2. **MonoDevelop**: Although MonoDevelop does support IronPython, it may require additional setup on Linux. Here is a general guide to help you get started:
   - Install MonoDevelop via the official repository or a PPA.
   - Ensure you have the latest version of Mono installed.
   - Install the IronPython add-in from within MonoDevelop.
   - Configure the IronPython interpreter path in the settings.

3. **Eclipse with PyDev**: PyDev does support IronPython, but you may need to configure it correctly. Here are the steps:
   - Install Eclipse and the PyDev plugin.
   - Add the IronPython interpreter in PyDev's preferences.
   - Ensure the necessary libraries and dependencies are correctly set up.

If you encounter specific issues during the setup, please provide more details, and I can assist further.
