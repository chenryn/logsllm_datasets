User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题500 internal server - AH02429: Response header name OS Ubuntu  Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS
Apache/2.4.18
Perl v5.22.1

So I have perl code that reads a mysql database, and then creates a dynamic webpage.  The code's been working great for years.  A week ago, my client calls and says they are getting a 500 internal server message.  I take a look and everything seems fine, but when I try to load the page, I get 500 error.  In the apache error log, there's this error:

[Tue May 30 22:16:13.144199 2017] [http:error] [pid 12487] [client 99.99.99.99:55628] AH02429: Response header name '&lt;!-- warning' contains invalid characters, aborting request

Has anyone seen this, or have any idea what is causing it?

Assistant: You have a key header with invalids characters, it wasn't a problem untill security fix CVE-2016-8743.

In my case wasApache + PHP and a whitespace before ":" like "X-CUSTOM-KEY :" and I haven't found other solution than changing the header.
