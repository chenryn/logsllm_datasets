User: Is it possible to create a hyperlink/button that calls a bash/python script on the user/local machine. I did search on the topic but there is a lot of discussion about the opening a port to a server (even the local port) but I don't want to open a port but execute everything locally. Is this even possible?
Thanks
Assistant: No.  That is not possible.  Nor desirable, due to the security implications.
