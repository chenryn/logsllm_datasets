### 6.2 General Notion of Analytics

#### 6.2.1 Data Pre-processing
Data pre-processing is a crucial initial step in the analytics process, as data gathering often employs loosely controlled methods that can generate datasets with missing or out-of-range values, redundant entries, and invalid data combinations. The primary issues with raw data are:

1. **Incomplete Data**: Missing attribute values or attributes of interest.
2. **Noisy Data**: Containing errors, anomalies, or outliers.
3. **Inconsistent Data**: Discrepancies in codes or names.

Performing analytics on unprocessed data can lead to misleading results. Data pre-processing typically involves the following tasks: cleaning, integration, transformation, reduction, and discretization.

**Data Cleaning**
- **Filling Missing Values**: Techniques include manual entry, using global constants, applying the mean of the attribute values, Bayesian rules, decision trees, or ignoring the instance.
- **Smoothing Noisy Data**: Sorting and partitioning data to detect and remove outliers using automatic binning, clustering, or human inspection.

**Data Integration and Transformation**
- **Data Integration**: Combines datasets from multiple sources into a coherent data store, resolving value conflicts and handling redundant data.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizes and scales values to fall within a specific range and applies aggregation techniques.

**Data Reduction**
- **Reducing Data Volume**: Reduces large volumes of data to a manageable size, enabling computationally expensive analytics tasks. Strategies include data aggregation, dimensionality reduction, numerical reduction, and concept hierarchy generation.

**Data Discretization**
- **Discretizing Continuous Attributes**: Divides the range of a continuous attribute into intervals and replaces the data values with discrete labels.

#### 6.2.2 Data Analysis
Analytics methods originate from mathematics (statistics, linear algebra, operations research) and computer science (databases, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics). Table 6.1 provides an overview of different analytics methods and their applications in service systems.

**Classification of Approaches**
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Summarizes big data into smaller, more useful pieces of information.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses historical data to forecast future trends or events.
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommends possible courses of action and the likely outcomes of each decision.

**Examples of Methods**
- **Clustering and Association Rules**: Identify similarities between customers (e.g., segmentation).
- **Text Mining Algorithms**: Analyze unstructured data for customer experience, sentiment, and complaint analysis.
- **Temporal Data Mining Algorithms**: Discover sequential usage patterns, such as browsing behavior.
- **Visual Analytics and Visual Data Mining**: Provide a clearer view and understanding of relationships within complex service systems.
- **Time Series Forecasting and Regression Analysis**: Used for prediction and trend analysis (e.g., service demand).

**Characterization of Methods**
- **Supervised Learning**: Constructs a function that relates input variables to output variables, used for prediction.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns and structures in data without labeled data, used for descriptive analysis.

### 6.3 Analyzing IT Services

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is widely adopted for IT service management, providing best practices in the form of reference models and processes. Key drivers for adopting ITIL include:

- **Design**: Speeds up service design with reusable, high-quality content.
- **Optimization**: Optimizes design through expert insights.
- **Compliance**: Eases compliance with industry regulations and mitigates risk.
- **Alignment**: Aligns business needs with IT service implementations.

**Example: Cost Reduction**
Procter & Gamble reduced IT spending by 10% of their annual budget ($125M) by adopting ITIL, primarily due to efficiency and optimization in service provisioning.

**The ITIL Lifecycle**
ITIL consists of five main phases: Service Strategy, Service Design, Service Transition, Service Operation, and Continual Service Improvement. Each phase is described in a corresponding book, providing best practices for managing IT services.

**Incident Management Service**
The primary objective of incident management (IM) is to resolve incidents (e.g., application bugs, disk usage thresholds, printer issues) quickly and effectively. The process is reactive, with a formal workflow to respond efficiently to reported incidents.

**Process Example: Printer Issue**
- A user contacts the service desk for help with a printing issue.
- If the issue cannot be resolved immediately, the service desk manager creates an incident record and assigns it to a technician.
- The technician identifies and fixes the problem.
- The service desk manager informs the user to retry printing.
- If the issue is resolved, the incident record is closed; otherwise, further attempts are made to resolve the incident.

Figure 6.3 provides a simplified representation of the business process model behind the IM service.
