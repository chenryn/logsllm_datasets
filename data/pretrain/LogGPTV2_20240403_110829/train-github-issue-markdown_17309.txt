# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Is it possible, to implement something like this:  
When there is an active process in the current tab, a confirmation dialect
window may show up before actually closing.
When I was writing vim, I need to use `C-W` to switch among vim tabs.  
`C-W` is also the hotkey to close the current tab.  
When the first two times I ran into this problem, I suppose it was some
crashing thing.  
Finally, I realized it was a hotkey conflict.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
I did not dive into the code base of this project yet, but I hope it is not
too hard to implement.
