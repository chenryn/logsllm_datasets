Hello,
after changing with django + celery to python 3.6.7 I get a DeprecationWarning
for  
../celery/utils/imports.py:
kind regards Jens
  * [x ] I have included the output of `celery -A proj report` in the issue.  
(if you are not able to do this, then at least specify the Celery  
version affected).
  * I have included all related issues and possible duplicate issues in this issue.
  * I have included the contents of `pip freeze` in the issue.
  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
  * I have tried reproducing the issue on more than one message broker and/or result backend.
  * I have tried reproducing the issue on more than one workers pool.
  * I have tried reproducing the issue with retries, ETA/Countdown & rate limits disabled.
problem is not visible with pyhton3.5.x  
same output for celery 4.3.rc2 or 4.2.1
# Expected Behavior
no Deprecation Warning for python 3.6.7 like before in python 3.5
