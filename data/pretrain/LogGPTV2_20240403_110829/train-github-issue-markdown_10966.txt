Subject: DeprecationWarning with Django + Celery on Python 3.6.7

Hello,

After migrating my project from Python 3.5.x to Python 3.6.7, I encountered a `DeprecationWarning` when using Django and Celery. The warning is as follows:

```
/venvdir/dev367/lib/python3.6/site-packages/celery/utils/imports.py:5:
DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see
the module's documentation for alternative uses
import imp as _imp
```

### Details

- **Celery Version:** 4.3.0rc2 (also tested with 4.2.1)
- **Python Version:** 3.6.7
- **Django Version:** (please specify if relevant)

### Steps Taken

1. **Report Command Output:**
   - I have included the output of `celery -A proj report` in this issue.
     ```plaintext
     celery:4.3.0rc2 (rhubarb) kombu:4.4.0 py:3.6.7 billiard:3.6.0.0 py-amqp:2.4.2
     platform -> system:Linux arch:64bit, ELF kernel version:4.14.92-boot2docker
     imp:CPython loader -> celery.loaders.app.AppLoader settings -> transport:amqp
     results:django-db
     ```

2. **Related Issues:**
   - I have checked for related issues and possible duplicates, but none were found.

3. **Pip Freeze:**
   - I have included the contents of `pip freeze` in the issue.
     ```plaintext
     # Please provide the output of pip freeze here
     ```

4. **Verification Against Master Branch:**
   - I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.

5. **Reproduction:**
   - I have tried reproducing the issue on more than one message broker and/or result backend.
   - I have tried reproducing the issue on more than one worker pool.
   - I have tried reproducing the issue with retries, ETA/Countdown, and rate limits disabled.

### Expected Behavior

- No `DeprecationWarning` should be present when using Python 3.6.7, similar to the behavior in Python 3.5.x.

### Actual Behavior

- When running the server with the command:
  ```sh
  /venvdir/dev367/bin/python -Wd manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
  ```
  - The following warning is displayed:
    ```plaintext
    /venvdir/dev367/lib/python3.6/site-packages/celery/utils/imports.py:5:
    DeprecationWarning: the imp module is deprecated in favour of importlib; see
    the module's documentation for alternative uses
    import imp as _imp
    ```

### Additional Information

- The issue does not occur with Python 3.5.x.
- The same warning is observed with both Celery 4.3.0rc2 and 4.2.1.

Kind regards,
Jens
