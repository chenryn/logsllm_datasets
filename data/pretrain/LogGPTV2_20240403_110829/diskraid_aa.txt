Diskraid
Diskraid is a command-line tool that enables you to configure and manage redundant array of independent (or inexpensive) disks (RAID) storage subsystems.
RAID is typically used on servers to standardize and categorize fault-tolerant disk systems. RAID levels provide various mixes of performance, reliability, and cost. Some servers provide three of the RAID levels: Level 0 (striping), Level 1 (mirroring), and Level 5 (striping with parity).
A hardware RAID subsystem distinguishes physically addressable storage units from one another by using a Logical Unit Number (LUN). A LUN object must have at least one plex, and can have any number of additional plexes. Each plex contains a copy of the data on the LUN object. Plexes can be added to and removed from a LUN object.
Most Diskraid commands operate on a specific host bus adapter (HBA) port, initiator adapter, initiator portal, provider, subsystem, controller, port, drive, LUN, target portal, target, or target portal group. You use the SELECT command to select an object. The selected object is said to have focus. Focus simplifies common configuration tasks, such as creating multiple LUNs within the same subsystem.
Note
The Diskraid command-line tool works only with storage subsystems that support Virtual Disk Service (VDS).
Diskraid commands
The following commands are available from within the Diskraid tool.
add
Adds an existing LUN to the currently selected LUN, or adds an iSCSI target portal to the currently selected iSCSI target portal group.
Syntax
add plex lun=n [noerr]
add tpgroup tportal=n [noerr]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
plex lun=
Specifies the LUN number to add as a plex to the currently selected LUN. CAUTION: All data on the LUN being added as a plex will be deleted.
tpgroup tportal=
Specifies the iSCSI target portal number to add to the currently selected iSCSI target portal group.
noerr
For scripting only. When an error is encountered, Diskraid continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
associate
Sets the specified list of controller ports as active for the currently selected LUN (other controller ports are made inactive), or adds the specified controller ports to the list of existing active controller ports for the currently selected LUN, or associates the specified iSCSI target for the currently selected LUN.

Parameters
Parameter
Description
set
Sets the specified flags to the specified values.
clear
Clears the specified flags. The all keyword clears all the automagic flags.

Syntax
break plex= [noerr]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
plex
Specifies the number of the plex to remove. The plex and the data it contained will not be retained, and the resources used by this plex will be reclaimed. The data contained on the LUN is not guaranteed to be consistent. If you want to retain this plex, use the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS).

Parameter
Description
initiator set
Sets the shared secret in the local iSCSI initiator service used for mutual CHAP authentication when the initiator authenticates the target.
initiator remember
Communicates the CHAP secret of an iSCSI target to the local iSCSI initiator service so that the initiator service can use the secret in order to authenticate itself to the target during CHAP authentication.
target set
Sets the shared secret in the currently selected iSCSI target used for CHAP authentication when the target authenticates the initiator.
target remember
Communicates the CHAP secret of an iSCSI initiator to the current in-focus iSCSI target so that the target can use the secret in order to authenticate itself to the initiator during mutual CHAP authentication.
secret
Specifies the secret to use. If empty the secret will be cleared.
target
Specifies a target in the currently selected subsystem to associate with the secret. This is optional when setting a secret on the initiator and leaving it out indicates that the secret will be used for all targets that do not already have an associated secret.
initiatorname
Specifies an initiator iSCSI name to associate with the secret. This is optional when setting a secret on a target and leaving it out indicates that the secret will be used for all initiators that do not already have an associated secret.
create

size=
Specifies the total LUN size in megabytes. Either the size= or the drives= parameter must be specified. They can also be used together. If the size= parameter is not specified, the LUN created will be the largest possible size allowed by all the specified drives.A provider typically creates a LUN at least as big as the requested size, but the provider may have to round up to the next largest size in some cases. For example, if size is specified as .99 GB and the provider can only allocate GB disk extents, the resulting LUN would be 1 GB. To specify the size using other units, use one of the following recognized suffixes immediately after the size:B - byteKB - kilobyteMB - megabyteGB - gigabyteTB - terabytePB - petabyte.
drives=
Specifies the drive_number for the drives to use to create a LUN. Either the size= or the drives= parameter must be specified. They can also be used together. If the size= parameter is not specified, the LUN created is the largest possible size allowed by all the specified drives. If the size= parameter is specified, providers will select drives from the specified drive list to create the LUN. Providers will attempt to use the drives in the order specified when possible.
stripesize=
Specifies the size in megabytes for a stripe or raid LUN. The stripesize cannot be changed after the LUN is created. To specify the size using other units, use one of the following recognized suffixes immediately after the size:B - byteKB - kilobyteMB - megabyteGB - gigabyteTB - terabytePB - petabyte.
target
Creates a new iSCSI target on the currently selected subsystem.
name
Supplies the friendly name for the target.
iscsiname
Supplies the iSCSI name for the target and can be omitted to have the provider generate a name.
tpgroup
Creates a new iSCSI target portal group on the currently selected target.
noerr
For scripting only. When an error is encountered, Diskraid continues to process commands as if the error did not occur.
