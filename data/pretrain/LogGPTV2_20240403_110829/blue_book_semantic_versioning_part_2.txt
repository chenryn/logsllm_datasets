    code](#unintended-changes) makes the definition of [when a change should be major
    blurry](#difference-in-change-categorization).
* Often the change that triggered the major change only affects a low percentage
    of your users (usually those using that one feature you changed in an
    incompatible fashion).
Does dropping Python 2 require a major release? Many (most) packages did this,
but the general answer is ironically no, it is not an addition or a breaking
change, the version solver will ensure the correct version is used (unless the
`Requires-Python` metadata slot is empty or not updated).
If you mark a feature as deprecated (almost always in a minor release), you can
remove that feature in a future minor release. You have to define in your
library documentation what the deprecation period is. For example, NumPy and
Python use three minor releases. Sometimes is useful to implement deprecations
based on a period of time. SemVer purists argue that this makes minor releases
into major releases, but as we've seen it’s not that simple. The deprecation
period ensures the “next” version works, which is really useful, and usually
gives you time to adjust before the removal happens. It’s a great balance for
projects that are well kept up using libraries that move forward at a reasonable
pace. If you make sure you can see deprecations, you will almost always work
with the next several versions.
# [Semantic versioning system problems](https://bernat.tech/posts/version-numbers/#whats-the-problem-with-semantic-versioning)
On paper, semantic versioning seems to be addressing all we need to encode the
evolution and state of our library. When implementation time comes some issues
are raised though.
!!! note "The pitfalls mentioned below don't invalidate the Semantic Versioning system,
you just need to be aware of them."
## Maintaining different versions
Version numbers are just a mapping of a sequence of digits to our branching
strategy in source control. For instance, if you are doing SemVer then your
`X.Y.Z` version maps a branch to `X.Y` branch where you're doing your current
feature work, an `X.Y.Z+1` branch for any bugfixes, and potentially an `X+1.0.0`
branch where you doing some crazy new stuff. So you got your next branch, main
branch, and bugfix branch. And all three of those branches are alive and
receiving updates.
For projects that have those 3 kinds of branches going, the concept of SemVer
makes much more sense, but how many projects are doing that? You have to be
a pretty substantial project typically to have the throughput to justify that
much project overhead.
There are a lot more projects that have a single `bugfix` branch and
a `main` branch which has all feature work, whether it be massively
backwards-incompatible or not. In that case why carry around two version
numbers? This is how you end up with [ZeroVer](#using-zerover). If you're doing
that why not just drop a digit and have your version be `X.Y`? PEP 440 supports
it, and it would more truthfully represent your branching strategy appropriately
in your version number. However, most library maintainers/developers out there
don’t have enough resources to maintain even two branches.
Maintaining a library is very time-consuming, and most libraries have just a few
active maintainers available that maintain other many libraries. To complicate
matters even further, for most maintainers this is not a full-time job, but
something on the side, part of their free time.
Given the scarce human resources to maintain a library, in practice, there’s
a single supported version for any library at any given point in time: *the
latest one*. Any version before that (be that major, minor, patch) is in essence
abandoned:
* If you want security updates, you need to move to the latest version.
* If you want a bug to be fixed, you need to move to the newest version.
* If you want a new feature, it is only going to be available in the latest
    version.
If the only maintained version is the latest, you really just have an `X` version
number that is monotonically increasing. Once again PEP 440 supports it, so why
not! It still communicates your branch strategy of there being only a single
branch at any one time. Now I know this is a bit too unconventional for some
people, and you may get into the [high version number
problem](#high-version-numbers), then maybe it makes sense to use [calendar
versioning](calendar_versioning.md) to use the version number to indicate the
release date to signify just how old of a version you’re using, but if stuff is
working does that really matter?
## [High version numbers](https://caremad.io/posts/2016/02/versioning-software/)
Another major argument is that people inherently judge a project based on what
it’s version number is. They’ll implicitly assume that `foo 2.0` is better than
`bar 1.0` (and `frob 3.0` is better still) because the version numbers are higher.
However, there is a limit to this, if you go too high too quickly, people assume
your project is unstable and shouldn’t really be used, even if the reason that
your project is so high is because you removed some tiny edge cases that nobody
actually used and didn’t actually impact many people, if any, at all.
These are two different expressions of the same thing. The first is that people
will look down on a project for not having a high enough version compared to its
competitors. While it’s true that some people will do this, it's not
a significant reason to throw away the communication benefits of your version
number. Ultimately, no matter what you do, people who judge a project as
inferior because of something as shallow as “smaller version number” will find
some other, equally shallow, reason to pick between projects.
The other side of this is a bit different. When you have a large major version,
like `42.0.0`, people assume that your library is not stable and that you
regularly break compatibility and if you follow SemVer strictly, it does
actually mean that you regularly break compatibility.
There are two general cases:
* The *true positives*: where a project that does routinely break it’s public API in meaningful ways.
* The *false positives*: Projects that strictly follow semantic versioning were
    each change which is not backwards compatible requires bumping a major
    version. This means that if you remove some function that nobody actually
    uses you need to increase your major version. Do it again and you need to
    increase your major version again. Do this enough times, for even very small
    changes and you can quickly get into a large version number `6`. This case
    is a false positive for the “stability” test, because the reality is that
    your project is actually quite stable.
## [Difference in change categorization](https://snarky.ca/why-i-dont-like-semver/)
Here's a thought experiment: you need to add a new warning to your Python
package that tries to follow SemVer. Would that single change cause you to
increase the major, minor, or patch version number? You might think a patch
number bump since it isn't a new feature or breaking anything. You might think
it's a minor version bump because it isn't exactly a bugfix. And you might think
it's a major version bump because if you ran your Python code with `-W` error you
suddenly introduced a new exception which could break people's code. [Brett
Cannon did
a poll](https://twitter.com/brettsky/status/1262077534797041665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw),
answered by 231 people with the results:
* *Patch/Bugfix*: 47.2%
* *Minor/enhancement*: 44.2%
* *Major/breaking*: 8.7%
That speaks volumes to why SemVer does not inherently work: someone's bugfix may
be someone else's breaking change. Because in Python we can't statically define
what an API change is there will always be a disagreement between you and your
dependencies as to what a "feature" or "bugfix" truly is.
That builds one of the arguments for [CalVer](calendar_versioning.md). Because
SemVer is imperfect at describing if a particular change will break someone
upgrading the software, that we should instead throw it out and replace it with
something that doesn’t purport to tell us that information.
## [Unintended changes](https://bernat.tech/posts/version-numbers/#will-a-major-version-bump-always-break-you)
A major version bump must happen not only when you rewrite an entire library
with its complete API, but also when you’re just renaming a single rarely used
function (which some may erroneously view as a minor change). Or even worse,
it’s not always clear what’s part of the public API and what’s not.
You have a library with some incidental, undocumented, and unspecified behavior
that you consider to be obviously not part of the public interface. You change
it to solve what seems like a bug to you, and make a patch release, only to find
that you have angry hordes at the gate who, thanks to [Hyrum’s
Law](https://www.hyrumslaw.com/), depend on the old behavior.
> With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you
> promise in the contract. All observable behaviors of your system will be
> depended on by somebody.
Which has been represented perfectly by the people behind
[xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png).
![ ](xkcd-workflow.png)
While every maintainer would like to believe they’ve thought of every use case
up-front and created the best API for everything. In practice it's impossible to
think on every impact your changes will make.
Even if you were very diligent/broad with your interpretation to avoid
accidentally breaking people with a bugfix release, bugs can still happen in
a bugfix release. It obviously isn't intentional, but it does happen which means
SemVer can't protect you from having to test your code to see if a patch version
is compatible with your code.
This makes “true” SemVer pointless. Minor releases are impossible, and patch
releases are nearly impossible. If you fix a bug, someone could be depending on
the buggy behaviour.
## [Using ZeroVer](https://0ver.org/)
ZeroVer is a joke versioning system similar to Semantic Versioning with the sole
difference that `MAJOR` is always `0`. From the specification, as long as you
are in the `0.X.Y` versions, you can introduce incompatible changes at any
point. It intended to make fun of people who use “semantic versioning” but never
make a `1.0` release, thus defeating the purpose of semver.
This one of the consequences of trying to strictly follow Semantic Versioning,
because once you give the leap to `1.0` you need to increase the `major` on each
change quickly leading to the problem of [high version
numbers](#high-version-numbers). The best way to fight this behaviour is to remember the often
overlooked [SemVer 2.0 FAQ
guideline](https://semver.org/#how-do-i-know-when-to-release-100):
> If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be
> 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should
> be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should
> probably already be 1.0.0.
