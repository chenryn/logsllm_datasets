User: I'm developing an application that manages network interfaces on behalf of the user and it calls out to several external programs (such as ifconfig) that requires root to make changes. (Specifically, changing the IP address of a local interface, etc.) During development, I have been running the IDE as root (ugh) and the debugger as root (double-ugh). Is there a nice way for the end-user to run these under a non-root account? I strongly dislike the size of the attack surface presented by GTK, wxPython, Python, and my application when it runs as root.
I have looked into capabilities, but they look half-baked and I'm not sure if I'd be able to use them in Python, especially if they are on a thread basis. The only option I haven't explored is a daemon that has the setuid bit set and does all the root-type stuff on behalf of the UI. I'm hesitant to introduce that complexity this early in the project, as running as root is not a dealbreaker for the users.
Assistant: There's no single user that is halfway between a "normal" user and root. You have root, and then you have users; users can have differing levels of capabilities. If you want something that's more powerful than a "normal" user but not as powerful as root, you just create a new user with the capabilities you want, but don't give it the privileges you don't want it to have.
