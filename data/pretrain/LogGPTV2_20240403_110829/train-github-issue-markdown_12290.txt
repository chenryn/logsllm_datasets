When working on the Multiview PR #16316 I'm facing a problem with the shader
generation: If you are going to use multiview you need to add an specific
directive on the shader: `layout(num_views = 2) in;`. This will require a FBO
with a TextureArray2D attached with two views.
Typically if we require a multiview session is because we are going to use an
`ArrayCamera` with multiple views (as a CAD software) or we want to render
both eyes in VR so we will get a huge improvement. But if we render just 1
view it will add a penalty because we will sill be using a two-dimensional
FBO.
Ideally we could have a "simple" way to compile the same program for different
"app's presets" so we could switch between the programs as the presets change.  
For example we could compile the with or without multiview and use these
shaders depending if we are in VR presenting or just painting in 2D to the
canvas.
Is there any ideas or any similar work already done in this area?
