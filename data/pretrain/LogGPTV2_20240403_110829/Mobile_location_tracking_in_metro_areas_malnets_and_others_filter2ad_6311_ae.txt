maximize the sensor coverage of the area the sensor network
is targeted at. In this case, a large metropolitan area. The
goal of the sensor network would be to measure traﬃc condi-
tions, temperature, or perhaps various social conditions that
might require human feedback. While these new designs for
sensor networks have included humans as sensors, the goals
are exactly the same as the old paradigm: maximizing the
sensor coverage of a given area. This is signiﬁcantly diﬀer-
ent then attempting to maximize coverage of people. Con-
cerns over privacy were directed at individuals being iden-
tiﬁed when posting sensor results, not being targeted for
surveillance. Additionally, privacy concerns were focused on
application level, not at the link-layer device level.
Inaccuracies in Geolocation.
One issue, we have not addressed is error in the geoloca-
tion of the sensors. Kim et al. [36] discuss the problem of war
driving router databases having inaccurate geolocations for
routers, and the resulting inaccuracies this produces when
the position of these routers are then used to establish the
locations of other individuals through the use of WiFi. Our
triangulation makes use of smartphone positions to trian-
93gulate, and similar issues could apply. However, modern
smartphones have enhanced GPS positioning abilities, that
use a combination of GPS, cell-tower information and avail-
able 802.11 APs to appropriate locate themselves to high-
degrees of accuracy. We believe it is reasonable to assume
far less error than that recorded by Kim et al., and that
positioning of these devices will only become more accurate
over time, as alternate applications develop that require high
degrees of positional accuracy.
9. CONCLUSION
Wireless mobile devices are becoming a ubiquitous aspect
of modern society. The large expectation is that in the near
future smartphones will be as or more ubiquitous than cell-
phones are today, and most likely the primary access device
to the Internet for a large percentage of the world’s popu-
lation. Most individuals are unaware of the privacy impli-
cations that these devices bring. While previous work has
been concerned about providing countermeasures to ensure
privacy, little has been done to quantify the potential for
pervasive monitoring. We have shown that with realistic
transmission distances of 802.11g wiﬁ, and small but not in-
signiﬁcant fractions of the population being part of a sensor
network(malicious or otherwise), one should be able to track
signiﬁcant portions of the population of metropolitan areas
with a high-granularity over long periods of time. We’ve
shown that population density has an eﬀect, but that spe-
ciﬁc geometry and building usage of the area being surveilled
can have a stronger eﬀect. Most importantly, changes in ra-
dius have signiﬁcant eﬀects on tracking capability, without
huge losses in accuracy. Our results are based on a series
of conservative estimates, making the upside potential for
loss of privacy higher. The next generation 802.11n WiFi
standard will quickly be moving to wireless phones, mak-
ing tracking even easier to perform at levels that might be
compatible with a malnet compromise.
For the ﬁrst time the technology for creating a ubiquitous
tracking network is well within the reach of digital crimi-
nals and small organizations. Thus the ability to ubiqui-
tously physically track individuals is moving from the hands
of large nation states and multi-national telecommunica-
tions corporations to small groups of organized criminals
and small companies which often lack oversight. All that is
required is a way of gathering up mobile nodes in a sensor
network via legitimate software or malware, and a system to
process the sensor data. The potential outcomes are discon-
certing, and thus we suggest that the need to strongly con-
sider and implement current and new methods to mitigate
wireless detection.
In future work we would like to determine how eﬀective
diﬀerent countermeasure are that do not analyze the poten-
tial damage that widely known auxiliary information can
do in deanonymizing subjects. Further, we would like to
determine if we can determine some ability to normalize
simulations so they are independent of the simulated areas
geometry.
As smartphones continue become the norm, we must ad-
dress the privacy implications involved in these privacy-leaking
devices. This is especially true as computing power becomes
more accessible and pervasive, and digital criminals ﬁnd new
ways of proﬁting from insecurity.

In Figs. 11 and 9 we see the area modeled in Chicago. Specif-

In both cases, the ﬁgure on the right gives
the simulator’s parameters, with the number of ﬂoors of the
building inscribed on the top, and its designation as an oﬃce
(OF), residence (RE), or service building (SR). Some build-
ings have multiple designations, as services are provided on
ground and lower levels, and other uses for higher levels. The
UDel simulator makes use of this information in its path and
destination planning during simulations.
