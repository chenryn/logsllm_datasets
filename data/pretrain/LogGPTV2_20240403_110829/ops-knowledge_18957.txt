User: Please explain what is SMTP mail protocol and how to send mail using Python script?
Assistant: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a standard protocol for transferring e-mail over the Internet. The SMTP mail protocol is primarily used for sending mail, but also supports getting mail. SMTP is a text-based protocol that uses TCP connections for communication, and mail is divided into multiple parts during delivery, such as mail body, attachments, and so on. To send mail using Python, you can use Python's `smtplib` module, which provides an easy way to send email. The following is a sample code for sending emails using the `smtplib` module: ``` python import smtplib from email.mime.text import MIMEText # Authentication information, which needs to be replaced with your own email address and password smtp_user = 'example@gmail.com' smtp_password = 'password' # recipient email address to_email = 'recipient@example.com' # email subject and content subject = 'Test Email' body = 'This is a test email sent using Python' # create email object message = MIMEText( body) message['Subject'] = subject message['From'] = smtp_user message['To'] = to_email # Connect to SMTP server and send email with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as smtp_server : smtp_server.login(smtp_user, smtp_password) smtp_server.sendmail(smtp_user, to_email, message.as_string()) ``` In the code, we first import the `smtplib` module and `MIMEText` class, and then set the authentication information, Recipient email address, email subject and content. Next, we create a `MIMEText` object and set the subject, sender address, and recipient address. Finally, we connect to Gmail's SMTP server and send the mail using the `smtp_server.sendmail()` method. It should be noted that many problems may be encountered in the process of sending emails, such as authentication failure, incorrect format of email content, etc. These problems can be eliminated by outputting logs or the return value of `smtplib` module.
