### Malware and Anti-Detection Mechanisms

#### Disabling Security Measures
- **Disables Anti-Virus Software and Other Protection Mechanisms:**
  - Blocks access to anti-virus vendors.
  - Blocks access to Windows Update.

#### Payload Delivery
- **Phase 3: Actual Payload Deployment**
  - The attacker gains control of the machine for use in botnets, spamming, DDoS attacks, keystroke logging, etc.
  - **Example:** Glieder trojan (ctd)

#### Multi-Phase Approach
- A multi-phase approach is used to bootstrap a fast-moving zero-day exploit into an arbitrary-sized malware payload.
- **Question:** How can a mere 376 bytes (SQL Slammer) be a threat?
- **Answer:** It doesn't have to be; it just needs to clear the way for the real threat.
- Cascading file droppers are a standard mechanism for staying ahead of AV tools.
- **Example:** Glieder trojan uses a relatively simple 2-3 stage infection strategy, while some malware employs 10-15 stage strategies.

#### Web-Based Infection Strategies
- **Multi-Stage Web Sites:**
  - Bait/spam sites
  - Redirector sites
  - Exploiter sites
  - Downloader sites
  - Adware/spyware sites
- **Example:** Hybris worm
  - Plug-in modules are encrypted with XTEA and digitally signed using a Davies-Meyer XTEA hash and a 1024-bit RSA key.
  - Modules are obtained from web sites or newsgroups.
  - Creates a "programmable virus" with various modules, including:
    - Windows help file infector
    - Polymorphic Windows executable infector
    - DOS .EXE infector
    - RAR/ZIP/ARJ infector
    - Word, Excel infectors
    - SubSeven backdoor dropper
    - Module to retrieve plugins from web servers
    - Module to retrieve plugins from news servers
    - General-purpose dropper
    - WSOCK32.DLL infection stealth module
    - DoS module
    - Antivirus web-site blocker module
    - Antivirus uninstall/database corruptor module
    - SOAP-based email generator

#### Autostart Mechanisms
- Almost all malware uses autostart mechanisms, which fall under the category of auto-start extensibility points (ASEPs).
- Common ASEPs include registry keys, startup folders, services, browser help objects (BHOs), layered service providers (LSPs), MSIE extensions, shell hooks, etc.
- There are several dozen known ASEPs in the Windows core OS alone.

#### Extortion and Ransom
- Pop-up messages requesting payment of money, potentially disabling the computer if the user does not pay.
- **Examples:**
  - Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA)
  - Software Protection Platform (SPP)

#### Programmable Viruses
- Provide situation-specific payloads.
- Capabilities are built in but encrypted.
- Virus compares a hash of disk filenames to built-in hash values and decrypts the file-specific payload when a match is found.
- Allows carrying custom payloads for specific files, URLs, applications, etc.
- **Example:** Cheeba

#### Removing Competing Malware
- Some malware, like SpamThru, includes a pirated copy of Kaspersky Antivirus to eliminate competition.
- DirectRevenue's "Dark Arts" division is dedicated to techniques like removing competing malware.
- **DirectRevenue EULA:** "You acknowledge that such software and updates may remove, disable, or render inoperative other adware or spyware programs, including but not limited to competing products."

#### Geolocation Tracking
- Records user geolocation information to defeat anomaly-detection software used by credit card companies.
- Uses the card from a botnet node near the victim’s registered location to evade transaction location tracking.

#### Targeted Attacks
- Perform targeted attacks on specific groups of users.
- **Example:** SpamThru trojan contacts controlling servers for information on victim-specific attacks, such as pump-and-dump scams for stock traders.

#### Hijacking Windows Update
- Hijacks Windows Update (BITS) to download malicious updates.
- Bypasses Windows Firewall and other security measures.
- **Example:** Jowspry

#### Nefarious Use of Standard Windows Popups
- Installs malware via fake Windows Update notifications.
- Requests credit card details for Windows product activation.
- **Examples:**
  - Antispysolutions.com (via Myspace)
  - Kardphisher

#### Advanced Anti-Removal and Rootkit Capabilities
- Hides itself by hooking the System Service Dispatch Table (SSDT).
- Auto-loads via WinLogon.
- Sets itself to run in SafeBoot mode.
- Adds an autostart system service under various aliases.
- Creates a remote thread inside Explorer.
- Causes attempts to terminate it by AV software to terminate the AV program instead.
- **Example:** Haxdoor Identity-theft Trojan

#### Spyware Capabilities
- Captures all information entered into MSIE.
- Recognizes financial-site-related keywords on web pages.
- Steals cached credentials (RAS, POP, IMAP, etc.).
- Feeds information to servers running on compromised hosts.
- **Example:** Haxdoor Identity-theft Trojan

#### Anti-Detection Mechanisms
- Changes scanners’ abilities to view memory by hooking the virtual memory manager (Shadow Walker).
- Uses kernel-mode thread injection to hide from scanners (Rustock).
- Uses NT native API to create registry entry names that the Win32 API can’t process.
- Unhooks the malware from lists of processes, threads, handles, memory, etc. (FU rootkit).
- Won’t run if the system contains certain tools (SoftICE, Filemon, Regmon, Visual Studio, Ethereal, etc.).
- Won’t run under a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM).

#### Processor Features and Hardware Monitoring
- Tricks with processor features (AMD64 memory-type-range registers) can defeat hardware-based monitoring.
- Joanna Rutkowska’s proof-of-concept “replacing attack” shows a different image to a PCI monitoring card than what’s actually there.

#### Encryption and Obfuscation
- Encrypts/obfuscates itself to evade detection.
- **Examples:**
  - IDEA virus
  - RDA Fighter virus
- Polymorphism and RDA rendered pattern-based scanning ineffective 5-10 years ago.
- Current scanners use behavioral analysis via heuristics and symbolic execution.

#### Rootkits for Sale
- Rootkit vendors modify their code to evade specific antivirus scanners for a fixed fee ($25-50).
- Undetected rootkits are available for sale.
- **Example:** Hacker Defender rootkit

#### Phishing Mechanisms
- Attacker controls the DNS through server compromise or bribing/blackmailing ISPs.
- Virus changes the victim’s DNS server entries ("pharming").
- Script in phishing email rewrites the victim’s hosts file.
- Many DNS providers ignore TTLs, making invalid DNS entries take weeks to correct.

#### Trojan Control
- Sniffs keystrokes and mouse clicks.
- Uses screen scraping to get around graphical keyboards and PIN-pads.
- Renders copies of genuine bank pages from the browser cache.
- **Example:** MetaFisher

#### Typo-Squatting
- Uses typo-squatting to install malware.
- **Example:** googkle.com

#### Example: Grams egold Siphoner
- Invades the victim’s PC via usual attack vectors.
- Uses OLE automation to spoof the user’s actions.
- Defeats any existing authentication method (passwords, SecurID, challenge-response calculator, smart card, etc.).

#### Availability of Private Data
- Stolen personal information is easily available.
- **Statistics:**
  - 89 million identities stolen in an 18-month period from Feb'05 to Jun'06 (Privacy Rights Clearinghouse).
  - Smaller breaches have a higher chance of misuse.
- Social security numbers (SSNs) and other information can be bought online.
- **Prices:**
  - $35 from secret-info.com
  - $45 from iinfosearch.com
- Financial institutions often use SSNs to verify customer identity.

#### Recommendations for Non-Geeks
- Put your head between your legs and...

#### Recommendations for Geeks
- Disable all Windows networking and RPC services.
- Browse the web from a locked-down Unix box with 'nobody' privileges.
- Read mail on a locked-down Unix box using a text-only client.
- Run all Internet-facing programs (Word, etc.) under DropMyRights as 'Guest' or (standard, non-Power) 'User'.

### Conclusion
- These aren't script kiddies anymore; their experts are as good as anything we’ve got.
