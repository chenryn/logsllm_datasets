The latest stable release of Next is 4.2.3, but 3.2.3 is listed as the latest
release in https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The latest release on the releases page should be 4.2.3
## Current Behavior
The latest release on the releases page is 3.2.3
It looks like maybe the security release was backported which was why the new
version was released.
