### Issue: Incorrect Latest Release Version on GitHub Releases Page

**Description:**
The latest stable release of Next.js is version 4.2.3. However, the GitHub releases page (https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases) lists version 3.2.3 as the latest release.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The latest release version displayed on the GitHub releases page should be 4.2.3.

**Current Behavior:**
- The latest release version displayed on the GitHub releases page is 3.2.3.
- It appears that a security release may have been backported, which could explain why a new version was released.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
- N/A (This is not a bug in the software itself but rather an issue with the documentation.)

**Context:**
- I was in the process of upgrading Next.js in my `package.json` and needed to determine the correct version to upgrade to.

**Environment:**
- N/A (This issue is related to the GitHub releases page and not specific to any particular environment.)

**Additional Information:**
- I have searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
