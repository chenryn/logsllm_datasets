Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of the template extraction:

**Log Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface alt0
```

**Explanation:**
- `<node_id>`: A placeholder for the specific node identifier (e.g., `node-106`).
- `<network_address>`: A placeholder for the network address (e.g., `0.0.0.0`).

This template clearly identifies the key components of the log line, making it easy to understand and apply to similar log entries.
