exemption  for  telecommunications  services  providers  to  public  and  private  sector
organizations.  However, it is not at all clear whether or not these organizations would
actually qualify as a telecommunications service provider under criminal law and so
organizations  could  probably  not  rely  on  this  exemption.  Anti-terrorism  legislation
greatly complicates the task of protecting the privacy of network communications and
the  personal  information  that  they  contain.    Not  only  can  a  broader  range  of
information  be  intercepted  under  authorization,  but  a  similarly  broad  range  of
information  is  to  be  retained  by  ISPs  and  telephone  companies.    In  addition,  there
appears to have been a reduction in the level of judicial discretion in the granting or
denying of interception requests.
It is, therefore, reasonable to suggest that the key to addressing these deficiencies is
the creation of a new exemption under criminal law.  This exemption would provide
the  necessary  legal  basis  for  the  interception  of  private  communications  for  the
purpose of protecting public  and  private  sector  computer  systems  or networks  from
mischief, unauthorized use or interference.
There is still a great deal of work that needs to be done to develop a general legal
framework for the conduct of intrusion detection within the public and private sectors.
Once  the  legal  framework  has  been  developed,  additional  work  will  be  required  in
order  to  develop  appropriate  policies,  standards  and  procedures  for  the  use  of  IDS,
especially  with  respect  to  what  can  be  collected,  how  that  information  is  to  be
handled, stored or disposed of and who has access to the information and under what
circumstances.    The  assistance  of  the  legal  community  would  be  invaluable  in  this
endeavour.
