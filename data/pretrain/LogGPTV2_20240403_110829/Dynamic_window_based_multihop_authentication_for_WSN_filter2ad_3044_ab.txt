3.2   Simulation and Result Analysis 
We simulate different DOS attacks varying in the ratio, in which 
malicious  nodes  tamper  messages.  The  tampering  ratio  ranges 
from 0 to 100%. By default, DWMA uses public key based digital 
signatures 
there  are  special 
instructions. 
Fig.2 shows that the total energy consumption using DWMA after 
the source node S sends 2000 messages with the intensity of DOS 
attacks changing from 0 to 100%. As given in Fig.2, the per-hop 
authentication method using digital signature based on public key 
consumes  too  much  energy  compared  with  DWMA.  We  also 
notice that the energy consumption of DWMA is less than that of 
the  per-hop  authentication  method  based  on  MAC.  Meanwhile, 
745DWMA  using  MAC  consumes  less  energy  than  the  per-hop 
authentication method based on MAC, but the difference of their 
energy consumption is very small. The reason is that the energy is 
mainly consumed by the communication between nodes, the cost 
of  authentication  using  MAC  only  makes  up  a  small  part  of  the 
total  energy  consumption.  In  the  process  of  the  simulation,  the 
throughput  achieves  up  to  85%  in  all  different  cases,  and  the 
possibility that malicious nodes are detected successfully is more 
than 90%. This is a clear indication that DWMA achieves nearly 
the  same  effect  compared  with  the  per-hop  authentication  but 
consumes 
in  energy 
consumption and robust against DOS attacks.

Malicious  nodes  could  confuse  authenticable  nodes  and  increase 
authentication  times  by  changing  the  hop  number  of  messages.

In this simulation, the malicious nodes change the hop number of 
messages  to  0.  As  shown  in  Fig.3,  authentication  times  increase 
with the attack intensity increasing, but in the hop attack it is more 
than in the no-hop attack.  Even if malicious nodes change the hop 
number, the throughput of DWMA still achieves at least 87%, and

4. CONCLUSION 
There are  many  types  of  DOS  attacks, and  it  is  very  difficult to 
resist DOS attacks. To be able to make use of digital signature to 
verify  data  and  limit  DOS  attacks,  this  paper  proposes  DWMA. 
DWMA  allows  that  sensor  nodes  could  decide  whether  to 
authenticate  data  by  itself,  thus  could  save  much  energy.  The 
simulation results show that DWMA is effective and flexible, and 
the  energy  consumption  of  DWMA  using  digital  signature  is  as 
nearly the same as that of the per-hop authentication using MAC 
In order to evaluate DWMA completely, we need to further study 
the  distribution  of  W  of  sensor  nodes  for  neighbor  nodes. 
Meanwhile,  the  functions  and  the  parameters  about  the  window 
value and the window growth delay degree are very significant in 
DWMA. In the future, we will consider how to set the functions 
and 
the  parameters
