### 3.2 Simulation and Result Analysis

We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed method, DWMA (Dynamic Window-based Message Authentication), under varying degrees of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. The tampering ratio, which represents the percentage of messages altered by malicious nodes, ranges from 0% to 100%. By default, DWMA uses public key-based digital signatures for data authentication, unless specified otherwise.

#### Simulation Parameters
- **Initial Value of W**: \( W_{\text{max}} = 100 \)
- **Growth Function of W**: \( \psi_s = W + 1 \)
- **Decreasing Function of W**: \( \psi_m = W / 2 \)
- **Update Function of Rdelay**: \( R_u = 2 \times \text{Bnum} \)
- **Decreasing Function of Rdelay**: \( R_m = R_{\text{delay}} - 2 \times W \)

#### Energy Consumption Analysis
Figure 2 illustrates the total energy consumption of DWMA after the source node S sends 2000 messages, with the intensity of DoS attacks varying from 0% to 100%.

- **DWMA (MAC)**: Consumes less energy compared to the per-hop authentication method based on MAC, but the difference is minimal.
- **DWMA (Digital Signature)**: Consumes significantly less energy than the per-hop authentication method using public key-based digital signatures.
- **Per-Hop Authentication (MAC)**: Consumes more energy than DWMA (MAC), but the difference is small.
- **Per-Hop Authentication (Digital Signature)**: Consumes the most energy among the methods.

The main reason for the energy savings in DWMA is that the energy is primarily consumed by communication between nodes, and the cost of authentication using MAC is a small fraction of the total energy consumption.

In all simulated scenarios, the throughput achieved up to 85%, and the probability of successfully detecting malicious nodes was over 90%. This indicates that DWMA achieves nearly the same security level as per-hop authentication but with significantly lower energy consumption, making it robust against DoS attacks.

- **Per-Hop Authentication (MAC)**
- **Per-Hop Authentication (Digital Signature)**

#### Hop Attack Analysis
Malicious nodes can increase authentication times by altering the hop number of messages. Figure 3 shows the effect of hop attacks on authentication times.

**Figure 3: Effect of Hop Attack on Authentication Times**

- **No Hop-Attack**: Authentication times increase with attack intensity.
- **Hop-Attack**: Authentication times are higher than in no-hop attacks.

Even when malicious nodes change the hop number, the throughput of DWMA still achieves at least 87%, and the probability of successfully detecting malicious nodes remains above 90%. This demonstrates that while hop attacks increase authentication times and energy consumption, they do not significantly impact the security of DWMA.

### 4. Conclusion

There are various types of DoS attacks, and resisting them is challenging. To effectively use digital signatures for data verification and limit DoS attacks, we propose DWMA. This method allows sensor nodes to decide whether to authenticate data, thereby saving energy. Simulation results show that DWMA is effective and flexible, with energy consumption similar to per-hop authentication using MAC.

To fully evaluate DWMA, further studies on the distribution of W values for neighboring nodes and the functions and parameters related to window value and window growth delay are necessary. In future work, we will consider how to set these functions and parameters for different application environments in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs).
