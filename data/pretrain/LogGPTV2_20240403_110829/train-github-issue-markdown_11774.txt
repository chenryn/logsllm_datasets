Currently the Blender Exporter doesn't seem to be exporting multiple
animations in Pose mode.
I have created a simple blend showing a cube with two basic animations, rest
and walk.
When I set the armature to rest mode and export, with rest mode selected in
the exporter, I get both animations in the exported file and can play either
of them. However they are distorted and do not play correctly.
When I export in pose mode the animations play correctly (whichever one I had
active at the time of export) but playing the other one simply plays the first
again. The exported data for both animations is identical.
here is the exported blend when exported in Pose mode with the walk animation
active at the time of export:

I am using blender 2.75 with the latest version of the exporter.
I am fairly new to blender so while I am fairly sure this is a bug, as I have
spent the whole day Googling and playing around, I cannot be 100% sure.
