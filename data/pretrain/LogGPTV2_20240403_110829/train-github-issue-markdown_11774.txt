### Issue with Blender Exporter and Multiple Animations in Pose Mode

**Summary:**
I have encountered an issue with the Blender Exporter where it does not properly export multiple animations when in Pose mode. Below, I detail the problem and provide relevant files for reference.

**Environment:**
- **Blender Version:** 2.75
- **Exporter Version:** Latest

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. **Blend File Setup:**
   - I created a simple blend file containing a cube with two basic animations: "Rest" and "Walk."

2. **Export in Rest Mode:**
   - Set the armature to Rest mode.
   - Select Rest mode in the exporter settings.
   - Export the file.
   - **Result:** Both animations are included in the exported file, but they are distorted and do not play correctly.

3. **Export in Pose Mode:**
   - Set the armature to Pose mode.
   - Ensure the desired animation (e.g., "Walk") is active.
   - Export the file.
   - **Result:** The active animation (e.g., "Walk") plays correctly, but attempting to play the other animation (e.g., "Rest") results in the first animation being played again. The exported data for both animations is identical.

**Files:**
- **Blend File:**
  - [Download Blend File](http://www.filedropper.com/jelly)

- **Exported Files:**
  - **Pose Mode (Walk Animation Active):**
    - [Download Exported File](http://pastebin.com/ss3dmzwP)
  - **Rest Mode (Walk Animation Active):**
    - [Download Exported File](http://pastebin.com/QeeZcCGx)

**Observations:**
- In Rest mode, both animations are exported, but they are distorted and do not play correctly.
- In Pose mode, only the active animation is correctly exported, and the other animation is not recognized, resulting in the same animation being played twice.

**Conclusion:**
I am relatively new to Blender, so while I believe this is a bug based on my research and testing, I cannot be 100% certain. Any guidance or confirmation would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.
