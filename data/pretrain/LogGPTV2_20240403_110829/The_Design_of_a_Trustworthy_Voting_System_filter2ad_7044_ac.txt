not  have to re-register. To register, a  voter  goes to the county 
office with the necessary identification as required by state law 
(e.g.,  proof  of  residence).  As  each  voter  registers,  a  record  is 
created for that voter in an append-only file. 
    To protect against attacks by dishonest poll workers, we add a 
voter-generated password  needed to  vote.  Since the  voter  may 
not trust the county officials with the password, he may bring a 
device  (e.g.,  a  PDA,  laptop,  or  cell  phone)  with  the  password 
preloaded  on  it.  Voters  lacking  their  own  device  can  use  the 
county’s computer to enter their password, but then they have to 
trust the county not to steal it. The voter will use this device to 
send his hashed password (not the plaintext password) to the 
registrar’s computer. 
     Some  voters  will  pick  weak  passwords  leading  to  easy 
offline  brute-force  attacks.  If  we  use  salt  values  as  tra-

Fig. 2. A voter registration record 
ditionally  done  to  defend  against  password  guessing,  then 
this  does  not  help  with  someone  that  has  access  to  the 
password database and all the salt values. Instead, we can use 
the precinct public key to encrypt the password hash with a 
random value rather than just storing the hash as is normally 
done.  The  password  hash  will  not  be  needed  until  election 
day, and the precinct private key will not be ready  
for decryption until then. Fortunately, this extra security does 
not add any complexity for the voter. He or she will continue 
to use his device to enter his password. The difference is that 
the  device  then  sends  Ek  (hash(password)  ||  confounder), 
where k is the precinct public key,  || is concatenation, and the 
confounder  is  a  random  value  that  is  solely  to  prevent 
guessing [15]. The encrypted password remains noninvertible 
until the secret-shared private precinct key is reassembled on 
election day. 
     In  addition  to  these  steps,  and  for  defense  in  depth,  the 
registrar’s  computer  generates  a  secret  for  voter  i,  Si  and 
breaks it into two parts, Si1 and Si2 where Si = Si1 || Si2 (where 
|| means concatenation or XOR). It encrypts Si1 and Si2 with a 
county-generated public key and stores hash(Si1||Si2). Each 
of  these  values  are  added  to  the  voter’s  record  and  will  be 
later used on election day. 
     Once the new record is ready for insertion, it is immedi-
ately  cryptographically  hashed  (with  the  rest  of  the  entire 
voter database), the hash is encrypted, and then the hash and 
the  record  are  inserted  into  the  database.  To  complete  the 
record’s creation, a signed, time-stamped printout of the rele-
vant  information  is  made  to  record  the  voter’s  registration, 
and  the  record  is  transmitted  to  a  centralized  state-wide 
location  (complies  with  HAVA’s  requirement  for  a  central-
ized  database  of  all  registered  voters).  Immediately  after 
registering, the voter is encouraged to write down his chosen 
password for future reference. Later, any voter can check his 
status by going to a state website as can be commonly done 
today. This procedure detects dishonest county registrars who 
discard the registrations of selected voters. 
     Because  a  voter’s  registration  information  may  change 
(e.g., people  may  move or die), database  modifications  will 
be necessary. To keep the integrity of the already computed 
hashes,  the  database  records  are  never  modified  in  place. 
Instead, when a voter record is modified or deleted, a signed 
record  describing  the  change  is  appended.  In  this  way,  we

can  have  an  audit  log  of  all  modifications  to  the  database. 
Using  this  registration  design,  we  have  distributed  the  trust 
among  local  and  state  participants,  and  we  have  created  an 
audit  trail  of  the  registration  process.  To  check  added  and 
deleted  voters,  we  suggest  using  random  audits  of  database 
records  to  catch  attacks  that  would  register  nonexistent  or 
ineligible voters. 
     This design is open to new attacks. A dishonest registrar 
could  compromise  the  machine,  and  record  secret  informa-
tion  (the  secret  values,  Si1  and  Si2).  To  protect  against  the 
revealing  of  Si1  and  Si2,  we  could  use  the  voter-supplied 
device (or the county-supplied device) to contribute to Si1 and 
Si2, but the voter would then have to be able to check if his 
contributions were used in Si’s generation. For simplicity, we 
use the design described, and note that an adversary has little 
power  without  the  voter  password,  which  even  the  registrar 
does not have. 
Step 3: Proof of Registration Mailed to the Voters. A few 
weeks before election day, the county sends to each voter by 
snail  mail  a  sample  ballot  and  booklet  with  the  candidates’ 
statements,  information  about  ballot  initiatives,  etc.  Many 
states already do this. However, now, included in the packet 
is a single-use difficult-to-forge card (e.g., printed on security 
paper,  containing  a  chip,  etc.)  that  serves  as  proof  of  citi-
zenship, residence, and registration, so that those issues need 
not  come  up  at  voting  time  (because  you  cannot  register 
without meeting the legal requirements). The card is free, just 
like  the  sample  ballot,  so  as  not  to  put  a  burden  on  poorer 
voters. The card will cost the states money, but revenue not 
spent  on  registration  difficulties  can  help  cover  the  card 
expense. 
     In addition, and most important, the card also contains the 
Si1  generated  and  recorded  at  registration  time  It  could  be 
printed on the card as characters, printed on the card as a bar 
code,  put  on  a  chip  etc.  (Si2  is  encrypted  and  electronically 
recorded in the database but is not on the card). The card also 
contains the address of the polling place, the hours it is open, 
and  a  reminder  to  bring  your  password.  The  voter  will  use 
this card for authentication to a poll worker on election day 
(Step 6). 
     The registration mailing has some different attack vectors. 
Someone could intercept Si1, but this should not be a problem 
(the voter password that  will be required later in the  voting 
process is still unknown). Denial-of-service attacks are still a 
problem.  For  example,  someone  could  purposefully  (or 
accidentally) fail to mail out some of the cards, or they could 
mail out the incorrect Si1. These attacks would be more diffi-
cult if it were possible to require multiple people to mail reg-
istration  cards  together  (forcing  collusion  for  a  successful 
attack), but having multiple mailing participants may not al-
ways be practical. Like current systems, we do not anticipate 
large-scale problems with the delivery via mail.

Step  4:  Voting  Machines  are  Prepared.  For  each  voting 
machine in precinct i, a file is prepared containing the list of 
all  voters  in  that  precinct  (This  is  why  a  short  plaintext 
header  is  needed  before  each  encrypted  record).  Each  ma-
chine in the precinct gets the same list so a voter can pick any 
voting machine and it will have the necessary information. If 
a  voter  goes  to  the  wrong  precinct,  he  will  have  to  cast  a 
provisional  (paper)  ballot  since  the  voting  machines  there 
will not have the required record. 
     Election officials will use the state-wide list of registered 
voters to build new lists of registered voters for each precinct. 
This list contains the set of all (encrypted) voter records for 
that  precinct,  but  a  different  integrity  field  will  be  used  in 
each record for the shorter list (each record’s integrity value 
in the state-wide list is calculated using all the records before 
it). Because the precinct list is a subset of the entire statewide 
list,  its  creation  should  be  done  by  a  group  of  trustees  to 
protect against precinct list attacks. 
     After voter registration has ended, the entire precinct list 
is stored on a read-only medium (e.g., a CD-ROM) that will 
be used to boot the voting machines in the precinct. The point 
of encrypting the entire voter file is to prevent anyone from 
tampering with it while it is in storage prior to the election or 
in transit to its precinct. A second CD-ROM is also prepared 
for  the  poll  workers’  machines  at  each  precinct.  This  CD-
ROM  contains  the  file  containing  each  voter’s  ID,  name, 
address,  and  Si2  value  (verified  by  the  voting  machine  to 
make sure a voter has been properly authenticated). This file, 
prepared  by  the  registrar,  is  also  encrypted  using  the 
precinct’s  public  key  to  prevent  tampering  in  storage  or 
transit. 
Step 5: Key Assembly at Each Precinct. Well ahead of the 
election,  the  EK  and  platform  certificate  for  each  voting 
machine and the public key of the precinct are posted on the 
county’s website. Just before each precinct opens on election 
day,  say  at  5:30  A.M.  for  a  6  A.M.  opening,  the  head  poll 
worker  shows  up  with  the  county’s  half  of  the  precinct’s 
private key. He gets it (on a smart card) from the county reg-
istrar,  who  unlocks  the  safe  the  day  before  the  election. 
Similarly,  a  sheriff’s  deputy  brings  the  other  half  at  5:30 
A.M. as well. If political parties have fractions of the private 
key, they also come at this time. Legal sanctions should be in 
place to encourage showing up on time (to prevent denial of 
service  attacks  by  shutting  down  the  polling  place).  This 
practice  is  similar  to  current  distribution  methods  where 
officials  hand-deliver  and  load  ballot  information  onto  the 
voting machines just before voting begins [20]. 
     Before  being  booted,  the  electronic  voting  machines  are 
inspected for signs of tampering. Alternatively, the machines 
could  be  vetted  back  at  headquarters  the  day  before  and 
hermetically  sealed  in  a  tamper-evident  way.  The  machines 
(which  have  no  hard  disks)  are  now  booted  from  the 
precinct’s CD-ROM.

     Once the voting software has been loaded, the poll worker 
uses  a  PDA  to  perform  attestation,  as  described  above  (For 
additional security we could verify the machine with multiple 
devices).  As  usual,  the  verified  software  disables  interrupts 
and  DMA  so  unverified  software  never  gains  control. 
Without a network, the attested code will continue execution 
without interference. 
     After the poll worker verifies the machine’s integrity, the 
smart cards with the precinct’s private key parts are succes-
sively inserted to assemble the final precinct key to decrypt 
the  passwords  and  Si2  on  the  CD-ROM.  The  precinct  key 
assembly can take place outside of the TPM, because all code 
on the machine has now been verified. Since the full precinct 
key was not available in one place until this moment, no one 
could have meaningfully changed the encrypted values in the 
voter files during their transport or storage. The last step in 
getting the precinct ready is verification of the poll workers’ 
machines (done in the same manner as the voting machines). 
After this step, the precinct is ready to accept voters. 
Step  6:  Voters  Show  up  and  Check  in.  When  the  doors 
open, the first voter approaches a poll worker and hands over 
the card he was mailed. (In the absence of the card, a paper 
provisional ballot has to be used.) The poll worker enters the 
voter’s ID in a computer, thus bringing up the voter’s (now 
decrypted)  record.  The  poll  worker  checks  if  the  name  and 
address on the screen match the card. For additional security, 
a digital photo of the voter taken at registration time could be 
included  in  the  computer  record  and/or printed  on  the  card. 
(A stolen card is worthless without the password.). The poll 
worker  then  asks  the  voter  if  he  remembers  the  password 
entered at registration time. If not, the voter is given a paper 
provisional ballot. Once such a system is introduced, people 
will  be  constantly  reminded  to  choose  passwords  easy 
enough  for  them  to  remember,  like  the  full  name  of  their 
favorite cousin. 
     Then  the  poll  worker  uses  a  bar  code  reader  to  enter  Si1
from the card. The computer then concatenates the Si1 value 
with its stored Si2 value to get Si = Si1 || Si2. It then creates a 
voting token (a contactful smart card) containing the voter’s 
ID  number,  VIDi,  and  Si.  After  the  token’s  generation,  the 
computer re-encrypts the voter’s record. The voter is handed 
the  voting  token,  as  shown  in  Fig,  3,  and  told  to  go  to  any 
voting machine and follow the on-screen directions. 
Step 7: Voters Cast Their Votes. Before starting to vote, the 
voter  may  want  to  verify  that  the  voting  machine  is  indeed 
running  the  open  source  software  published  on  the  county 
to 
take  part 
registrar’s  website.  Anyone can do precisely the same thing 
the poll worker did first thing in the morning: use a portable 
electronic  device  to  send  a  challenge  to  the  voting  machine 
over  the  serial  cable  and  check  the  response  to  see  if  the 
signed  checksum  of  the  software  is  correct  and  has  a  valid 
signature (A technically challenged voter could bring a tech-
savvy  friend  to  verify  the  machine  for  him  or  her).  Since 
some  voters  will  not  wish 
in  machine 
verification, the user interface should make it easy to bypass 
this  step if desired, to allow  the voter to immediately begin 
the voting process.  
     Attestation’s  benefits  are  the  protection  of  voter  privacy 
(successful  attestation  under  our  assumptions  can  show  that 
the  voting  machine  software  did  not  record  voter  informa-
tion)  and  making  it  more  difficult  to  compromise  a  voting 
machine. Because the source code is public, a voter can now 
have  more  confidence  that  the  machine  is  functioning 
correctly.  In  the  past  simple  software  modifications  could 
have violated voter privacy or  mis-recorded votes. Now, an 
attacker  must  violate  one  of  our  attestation  assumptions  to
