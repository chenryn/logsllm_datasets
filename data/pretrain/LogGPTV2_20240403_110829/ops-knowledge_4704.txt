User: I'm writing git commands through a Python script (on Windows)
When I double click on myScript.py, commands are launched in the Windows Command Prompt.
I would like to execute them in Git Bash.
Any idea how to do that without opening Git Bash and write python myScript.py?
Assistant: in the top of your python file add #!/usr/bin/python then you can rename mv myScript.py myScript and run chmod 755 myScript. This will make it so you can run the file with ./myScript look into adding the file directory to your path or linking it to the path if you want to be able to run it from anywhere.
