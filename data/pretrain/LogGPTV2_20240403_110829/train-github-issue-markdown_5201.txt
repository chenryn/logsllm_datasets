I tried doing this myself, but don't know enough of the internals to get this
done on my own.
it looks like these need to be modified
  * sqlalchemy/sql/default_comparator.py
  * sqlalchemy/sql/operators.py
but not sure about
  * sqlalchemy/sql/compiler.py
there are probably more files.
if someone can get one working, I can do the rest and build out tests.
