The Cavalry Year[0]
A Path Forward for Public Safety
Joshua Corman && Nicholas J. Percoco
Our Dependance on Technology is 
Growing Faster than our Ability to 
Secure it.
Problem Statement:
While we struggle to secure our 
organizations, connected 
technologies now permeate every 
aspect of our lives; in our cars, our 
bodies, our homes, and our public 
infrastructure.
Our Mission:
To ensure technologies with the 
potential to impact public safety and 
human life are worthy of our trust.
Collecting, Connecting,  
Collaborating, Catalyzing 
Our Approach:
Collecting existing research and 
researchers towards critical mass. 
Our Approach:
Connecting researchers with each 
other and stakeholder in media, 
policy, legal, and affected industries.
Our Approach:
Collaborating across a broad range 
of background and skill sets.
Our Approach:
Catalyzing research and corrective 
efforts sooner than would happen on 
their own.
Our Approach:
One thing is clear…
The Cavalry Isn't Coming
It Falls To Us
One thing is clear…
The Cavalry Isn't Coming
It Falls To Us
It Falls To YOU
One thing is clear…
The Cavalry Isn't Coming
It Falls To Us
It Falls To YOU
We must be ambassadors of our profession 
We must be the voice of technical literacy 
We must research that which matters 
We must amplify our efforts 
We must escape the echo chamber 
We must team with each other

What Worked Well
What Worked Well
•The Mission 
•The problems statement, instinct & timing were right. 
While pieces of this were tried before, timing 
matters… 
•Collecting, Connecting, Collaborating, Catalyzing 
•Teamwork and collective knowledge proved 
immediately useful to existing research & researchers. 
E.g. in Medical & Auto 
•It Takes a Guild 
•Diverse, but complementary skills made us stronger - 
including people from industry, from government, 
and/or people less interested in being public rockstars
What Worked Well (cont’d)
•Finding Members to Educate Us 
•To ready ourselves to be better ambassadors to the 
outside world 
•To train us on Professional Development and Soft 
Skills 
!
•Outside Interest, Feedback, New Members 
•Tangible results fueled interest and commitment 
•Positive and constructive feedback loops
What Worked (Less Well)
What Worked (Less Well)
•Too Much Initial Scope 
•“Body, Mind & Soul” replaced by only “Body”  
•AKA “Public Safety & Human Life” 
•Poor Project Management 
•In lieu of concrete, bite-sized roles & tasks 
willing parties grew impatient 
•Poor Balance 
•Discrete progress vs external communication 
•The void was often filled with false information 
and avoidable friction/opposition

Surprises

expected

Industry Reception

help who proved to be amazing guides and assets
Surprises
