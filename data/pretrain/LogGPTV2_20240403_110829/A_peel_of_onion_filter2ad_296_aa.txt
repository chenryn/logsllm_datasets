## Abstract
"Our motivation here is not to provide anonymous communication, but to separate identification from routing."

## Motivational Use Case Example
Navy Petty Officer Alice is temporarily in Repressia. Safe back in her room at the Repressia Grand Hotel, PO Alice wants to read and/or post to sealiftcommand.com.

## Government Uses
- **Open Source Intelligence Gathering**
- **Sensitive Communications with Untrusted/Untrusting Parties**
- **Encouraging Open Communications with Citizens**
- **Location-Protected Servers for Defense in Depth**
- **Protecting Public Infrastructure**
  - Interacting with network sensors

## Ordinary Citizen Alice
Alice, an ordinary citizen, needs to protect her behavior from:
- **Cyberstalking by an Abusive Ex-Spouse**
- **Behavior Tracking and DNS Manipulation by Her ISP**
- **Misunderstandings from Her Employer When Investigating Disease Information for a Friend**
- **Harassment for Blogging Her Views**
- **Malicious Parties Watching Her Log into Club Penguin (and Her Mom Logged into Twitter from Work)**
- **Spear Phishers Watching Her Log into Her Bank**

### It's Not Only About Dissidents in Faraway Lands
The need for anonymity and privacy extends to everyday citizens like Alice.

## Officer Alice
- **Setting Up Sting Operations:**
  - As a Collaborator
  - As a Service Provider
- **Monitoring Criminal Activity Online**
- **Encouraging Anonymous Tips**

## Researcher/Reporter/Rights Worker Alice
- **Gathering Information While Protecting Sources**
- **Accessing Locally Censored or Monitored Information**
- **Reporting Locally Censored or Monitored Information**

## Corporation Alice
- **Investigating Competitors' Public Sites**
- **Avoiding Leaking Strategy or Nonpublic Information**
- **Protecting Customers:**
  - From Spear Phishing
  - From Attacks or Selective Service Disruption
  - Maintaining Privacy Sensitivity

## Additional Benefits of Anonymity Systems
- **Poor Man’s VPN:** Provides access to the internet despite:
  - Network Port Policy Disconnects
  - DNS Failures

## The Ineffectiveness of Private Solutions
- **Citizen Alice, Officer Alice, and AliceCorp:** Using a small, private anonymity net is ineffective.
- **Shared Anonymity Net:** More effective as it provides better anonymity through shared usage.

## Single Relay Design
- **Simplest Design:** Uses a single relay to hide connections.
- **Vulnerability:** An attacker who sees Alice can see who she's talking to.

## Encryption and Relays
- **Add Encryption:** To stop eavesdroppers on Alice.
- **Single Point of Failure:** A single relay is a single point of failure and bypass.
- **Timing Analysis:** Can bridge all connections through a relay, making it a target.

## Low-Latency vs. High-Latitude Systems
- **Low-Latency Systems:** Vulnerable to end-to-end correlation attacks.
- **High-Latency Systems:** Provide better protection but are more expensive and slower.

## Multiple Relays
- **Add Multiple Relays:** No single relay can betray Alice.
- **Corrupt First Hop:** Can tell that Alice is talking but not to whom.
- **Corrupt Last Hop:** Can tell someone is talking to Bob but not who.

## Onion Routing
- **Circuit Construction:** Alice constructs a circuit through multiple relays.
- **Connection Creation:** Establishes a connection through the circuit.
- **Data Exchange:** Data is exchanged through the circuit.

## Onion Routers
- **Clique Topology:** All relays are connected to each other.
- **Overlay Network:** Relays form a network over the existing internet infrastructure.

## Mix Networks vs. Onion Routing
- **Different Threat Models:**
  - **Mix Networks:** Based on an adversary not being able to correlate inputs and outputs.
  - **Onion Routing:** Based on an adversary not being able to see both inputs and outputs.
- **Communication Paradigms:**
  - **Mix Networks:** Per-message encryption.
  - **Onion Routing:** Circuit-based encryption, supports bidirectional and low-latency communication.

## What Onion Routing Is
- **Uses Expensive Crypto (Public-Key):** Lays a cryptographic circuit over which data is passed.
- **Free-Route Circuit Building:** Makes the location of circuit endpoints unpredictable.

## Why "Onion Routing"?
- **Key Distribution Data Structure:** Layers of public-key crypto, like an onion.
- **Circuit Setup:**
  - **NRL v0 and v1:** Used onions to build circuits, lacked forward secrecy, required storing records against replay.
  - **Tor (NRL v2):** Uses one-layer "onion skins," ephemeral Diffie-Hellman for forward secrecy, no need to record processed onions.

## Origin of the Name "Tor"
- **Frequent Question (2001-2002):** Roger was asked about which onion routing project he was working on.
- **Roger's Response:** THE onion routing, the original project from NRL.
- **Rachel's Suggestion:** "That’s a good acronym."
- **Recursive Acronym:** Tor (The Onion Router).
