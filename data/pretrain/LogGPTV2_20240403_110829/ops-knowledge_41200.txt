I have experimented with several Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) on the Windows platform and ultimately found Eclipse, combined with the PyDev plugin, to be the most suitable for my needs. This combination is both user-friendly and efficient. I am currently engaged in a relatively large-scale project.

Given that I recently moved and do not yet have an internet connection, I am seeking a version control system that can be installed locally on my hard drive. While I initially considered CVS, I am open to other alternatives as well. Ideally, the chosen solution should integrate seamlessly with Eclipse and be straightforward to configure.

Could anyone suggest a viable option? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I apologize in advance for any grammatical or spelling errors in my English.

In response to your query, I have personally used Eclipse in conjunction with Subclipse for Subversion and the Bazaar plugin. Both options function effectively. However, I discovered that the Tortoise versions of these version control systems (e.g., TortoiseSVN, TortoiseBzr) offer such a high level of functionality and ease of use that I opted to abandon the Eclipse plugins. On Windows, the Tortoise series integrates smoothly with the file explorer (such as Windows Explorer or Total Commander), providing features like icon overlays to indicate file modifications, log viewing, and revision comparison. For these reasons, I highly recommend the Tortoise tools for your version control needs.
