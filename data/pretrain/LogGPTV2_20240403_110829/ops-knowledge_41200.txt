User: I tried several Python IDEs (on Windows platform) but finally I found only Eclipse + PyDev meeting my needs. This set of tools is really comfortable and easy to use. I'm currently working on a quite bigger project. I'd like to have a possibility to use CVS or any other version control system which would be installed on my local harddrive (I recently moved my house and don't have yet an access to internet.)
It doesn't matter for me if it'd be CVS - can also be any other version control system. It'd be great if it will be not too hard to configure with Eclipse. Can anyone give me some possible solution? Any hints?
Regards and thanks in advance for any clues. Please forgive my English ;)
Assistant: I tried Eclipse+Subclipse and Eclipse+Bazaar plugin. Both work very well, but I have found that Tortoise versions of those version source control tools are so good that I resigned from Eclipse plugins. On Windows Tortoise XXX are my choice. They integrate with shell (Explorer or TotalCommander), changes icon overlay if file is changed, shows log, compare revisions etc. etc.
