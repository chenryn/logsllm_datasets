clusters if J(Ci, Cj) > τ . Again, because pairwise similar-
ity is expensive to compute, we rely on minhashing the set
of users for each cluster, performing a similar grid search
to the one presented in Figure 3 to determine the optimal
parameters. We ultimately elect k = 2 for a Jaccard simi-
larity threshold of τ = 0.5, which we determine via manual
analysis best captures evolving stockpiles of spam accounts
controlled by a single criminal without combining benign
clusters with spam campaigns or merging distinct memes.
Using these parameters, we combine clusters with the same
user minhash and afterwards ﬁlter out clusters with fewer
than two thousand distinct users. This step provides us with

Figure 4: Scatter plot of actions taken by Twitter (and its
users) and their relation to memes, infections, and fraudu-
lent account behavior. We ﬁnd that retroactive labeling of
clusters provides a powerful tool for distinguishing the three
classes of clusters.
our ﬁnal set of 16,206 clusters containing 254,366,938 tweets
and 35,869,312 users.
3.3 Classiﬁcation
In order to distinguish legitimate memes from infections
or spam produced via fraudulent accounts, we develop a
multi-class classiﬁer based on observing retroactive actions
taken by Twitter and its users, shown in Figure 1 (). As
discussed in Section 2, there are no existing classiﬁers that
both scale and accurately distinguish between compromised
and fraudulent accounts, forcing us to develop a new tech-
nique. Our classiﬁer hinges on the observation that compro-
mised users—or Twitter acting on their behalf—frequently
delete spam tweets posted via their account upon recogniz-
ing criminals have hijacked their credentials. Similarly, as
previously observed [28], Twitter proactively suspends abu-
sive accounts that disseminate spam or form an excessive
number of relationships.
To capture both of these behaviors, we select a random
sample of a thousand tweets and a thousand users from
each cluster in our dataset and query Twitter’s users/show
and statuses/show API respectively. The response code re-
turned by Twitter allows us to label users and tweets as
valid, deleted, suspended, or now private. Due to delays in
actions, we waited until one month after the ﬁnal day of
data collection (October 21, 2013) before querying the API
endpoints. To verify the power of these features, we man-
ually analyze a sample of 1,699 clusters and label each as
either a meme (1,038 samples), infection (265 samples), or
spam from fraudulent accounts (365 samples). We plot each
labeled cluster as a function of the percentage of suspended
users versus the percentage of deleted tweets, shown in Fig-
ure 4. The three non-overlapping clusters indicate that our
retroactive feature set provides a strong starting point for
segmenting the three classes of clusters.
3.3.1 Training
To determine an optimal hyperplane that separates our
three classes, we train a multi-class logistic regression using
10-fold cross validation seeded with our manually labeled
dataset of 1,699 clusters. We represent each cluster as a
