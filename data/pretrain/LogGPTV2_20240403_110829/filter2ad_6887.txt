ABSTRACT
With the rapid growth of the demands for mobile data, wire-
less network faces several challenges, such as lack of eﬃcient
interconnection among heterogeneous wireless networks, and
shortage of customized QoS guarantees between services.
The fundamental reason for these challenges is that the ra-
dio access network (RAN) is closed and ossiﬁed. We pro-
pose OpenRAN, an architecture for software-deﬁned RAN
via virtualization.
It achieves complete virtualization and
programmability vertically, and beneﬁts the convergence of
heterogeneous network horizontally. It provides open, con-
trollable, ﬂexible and evolvable wireless networks.

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of mobile data demands [5] and
the increasing prosperity of mobile Internet, mobile wireless
networks will keep growing at high speed. However, wireless
network has to face several intractable challenges. First,
while there exist various heterogeneous wireless networks,
i.e., pluralistic standards, they can hardly interconnect. It
wastes plenty of wireless infrastructures and spectrum re-
sources [4]. Second, wireless services proliferate signiﬁcantly,
and diﬀerent services require diﬀerent network characteris-
tics. Unfortunately, ignoring these diﬀerences and just sup-
porting them with the same network characteristics, current
wireless network leads to low QoS and QoE. The main reason
is that the radio access network (RAN) is closed and ossiﬁed.
This is due to the neglect of network state and ﬂexible con-
trol. Although there may be considerable wireless networks
around us, we cannot access the most appropriate one or
select multiple networks to support us simultaneously. The
only thing we can do is to access the speciﬁc network all the
time, even if this network performs quite poorly.

To deal with the issue raised above, it calls for a more open
and eﬃcient architecture for radio access network. Software-
deﬁned network (SDN) proposed for wired networks makes
them much more controllable, programmable and ﬂexible [6].
Bansal et al.
[1] extend SDN into wireless network. China
Mobile Ltd. (CMCC) proposes a C-RAN architecture that
introduces a cloud pool to process wireless baseband data
[2]. Moreover, wired network virtualization, e.g. cloud com-
puting, and wireless virtualization technologies also provide
us promising ways for the future network. However, most
related work focuses on part of the problem and hardly pos-
sesses the generality.
Addressing the closure and ossiﬁcation of RAN, we pro-
pose OpenRAN, a software deﬁned RAN architecture via
virtualization. Our proposed architecture achieves complete
virtualization and programmability, which makes RAN more
open, controllable, ﬂexible and evolvable.
2. ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION
2.1 OpenRAN Overview
The overview of our software-deﬁned RAN architecture
is shown in Fig. 1. It contains three main parts: wireless
spectrum resource pool (WSRP), cloud computing resource
pool (CCRP) and SDN controller.
WSRP consists of multiple physical remote radio unit-
s (pRRUs) distributed at various locations. To eﬃciently
support heterogeneous networks convergence, WSRP virtu-
alizes spectrum by RF virtualization technology, which en-
ables several virtual RRUs (vRRUs) with diﬀerent wireless
protocols coexisting in one shared pRRU. For example, as
shown in Fig. 1, one pRRU can simultaneously support two
vRRUs running UMTS and GSM respectively.
CCRP is comprised of a large amount of physical proces-

SDN
control strategy makes RAN more open and (cid:13)exible.
2.4 Programmable Scheme
Current wireless networks and corresponding instruments
are complicated and diﬃcult to control and customized [3].
Our architecture is deeply programmable in both control
plane and data plane, which makes RAN more controllable
and evolvable. In the control plane, the SDN controller has
the capability of establishing or modifying the rules in each
virtual access element, such as routing, bandwidth alloca-
tion and setting ﬂow priorities. In the data plane, although
diﬀerent wireless protocols operate quite diﬀerent from each
other, they always share some modules, such as modulation,
coding and interleaving. Inspired from software deﬁned ra-
dio, we modularize wireless protocols in vBBUs. After that,
each vBBU chooses and combines the appropriate modules
to implement the wireless protocol, as shown in Fig. 2.
3. AN EXAMPLE
As Fig. 1 shows, one carrier wants to establish a UMT-
S network and two GSM networks in two adjacent areas.
First, the controller estimates the resources that each net-
work needed in view of the requirements and actual network
characteristics. Second, the controller creates vRRUs, vB-
BUs and vBSCs by allocating appropriate spectrum, com-
puting and storage resources to them via spectrum level
and cloud level virtualizaiton. Third, the controller sends
ﬂows to conﬁgure the data processing rules in vBSCs and
deploy corresponding wireless protocols in vBBUs by pro-
grammable scheme. Forth, since three vRRUs are distribut-
ed in neighboring cells, in order to eliminate the interferences
among them, the controller deploys one cooperation virtual
network. Fifth, by application level virtualization, controller
provides an operating virtual network that satisﬁes the re-
quirements of the carrier.

Diﬀerent from the vertical networking method adopted by
current wireless access network, in this system traditional
base band units (BBUs) and base station controllers (BSC-
s) do not exist any more. They are replaced by virtual ones
(vBBUs and vBSCs) deployed in shared physical processors
by virtualization technologies. After that, these virtual ac-
cess elements, including vBSCs, vBBUs and vRRUs, consti-
tute a complete RAN. Without loss of generality, we also
use BSCs to represent the RNCs in 3G, and etc.
SDN controller is the control plane of heterogeneous RANs
by abstracting and combining control functions of the access
elements.
It determines the strategies of each vBBU and
vBSC, and each virtual access element contains a SDN agent
to communicate with controller through SDN protocol.
2.2 Virtualization
Our architecture contains four levels of virtualization: ap-
plication level, cloud level, spectrum level, and cooperation
level. 1) In application level virtualization, ﬂow space is di-
vided and each virtual space operates and manages its own
control strategies. In this case, virtual spaces correspond to
several network operators or services. 2) In cloud level vir-
tualization, SDN controller creates vBBUs and vBSCs by
virtualizing physical processors and allocating appropriate
computing and storage resources. 3) Spectrum level virtu-
alization refers to the virtualization of spectrum by RF vir-
tualization technology, which enables several vRRUs with
diﬀerent wireless protocols to coexist in one shared pRRU.
4) Cooperation level virtualization constructs several virtual
networks, including virtual nodes and virtual links. This is
because cooperative communication among multiple vRRUs
beneﬁts the inter-cell interference elimination, and it calls
for communications between diﬀerent vBBUs and vBSCs.
2.3 SDN Control Strategy
We adopt ﬂow based centralized control method in our
architecture. The controller creates and dynamically opti-
mizes the virtual access elements according to the require-
ments by eﬃciently and fairly virtualizing and allocating
spectrum, computing and storage resources to virtual ac-
cess elements. We adopt ﬂow based “match-action” control
strategy. Packet header in each ﬂow has several match ﬁeld-
s such as IP address, mac address and port. Each virtual
access element has a uniﬁed SDN agent to resolve the con-
trol ﬂow. The controller sets the rules in each virtual access
element. When one element receives a packet, it ﬁrst check-
s whether this ﬂow can match its control rules.
If so, it
executes the corresponding action. Actions in diﬀerent vir-
tual access elements may be diﬀerent, e.g. vBSC may route
