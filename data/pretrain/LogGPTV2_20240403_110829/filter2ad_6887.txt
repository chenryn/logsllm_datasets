## Abstract
The rapid growth in mobile data demands has introduced several challenges for wireless networks, such as the lack of efficient interconnection among heterogeneous wireless networks and the shortage of customized Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. The primary reason for these challenges is the closed and ossified nature of the Radio Access Network (RAN). We propose OpenRAN, an architecture that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) and virtualization to achieve complete virtualization and programmability. This approach enhances the convergence of heterogeneous networks, providing open, controllable, flexible, and evolvable wireless networks.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing demand for mobile data and the proliferation of mobile internet services have led to the rapid growth of mobile wireless networks. However, this growth has also brought several intractable challenges. First, the existence of various heterogeneous wireless networks with different standards makes it difficult to achieve efficient interconnection, leading to wasted infrastructure and spectrum resources. Second, the diverse requirements of different wireless services are not well-supported by the current one-size-fits-all network, resulting in low QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE). The fundamental issue is that the RAN is closed and inflexible, lacking the ability to adapt to network state and provide flexible control. 

To address these challenges, we propose OpenRAN, a software-defined RAN architecture that leverages virtualization to achieve complete virtualization and programmability. This makes the RAN more open, controllable, flexible, and evolvable.

## 2. Architecture Description

### 2.1 Overview of OpenRAN
The proposed OpenRAN architecture, shown in Figure 1, consists of three main components: the Wireless Spectrum Resource Pool (WSRP), the Cloud Computing Resource Pool (CCRP), and the SDN Controller.

- **Wireless Spectrum Resource Pool (WSRP):** This pool includes multiple Physical Remote Radio Units (pRRUs) distributed across various locations. To support the convergence of heterogeneous networks, WSRP uses RF virtualization technology to create multiple Virtual RRUs (vRRUs) within a single pRRU. For example, a single pRRU can simultaneously support vRRUs running UMTS and GSM.

- **Cloud Computing Resource Pool (CCRP):** This pool comprises a large number of physical processors that form a high-speed cloud computing network. Traditional Base Band Units (BBUs) and Base Station Controllers (BSCs) are replaced by virtualized counterparts (vBBUs and vBSCs) deployed on shared physical processors.

- **SDN Controller:** This component acts as the control plane for the heterogeneous RAN by abstracting and combining the control functions of the access elements. It determines the strategies for each vBBU and vBSC, and each virtual access element contains an SDN agent to communicate with the controller through the SDN protocol.

### 2.2 Virtualization Levels
OpenRAN incorporates four levels of virtualization:

1. **Application Level:** Flow space is divided into virtual spaces, each operating and managing its own control strategies. These virtual spaces correspond to different network operators or services.
2. **Cloud Level:** The SDN controller creates vBBUs and vBSCs by virtualizing physical processors and allocating appropriate computing and storage resources.
3. **Spectrum Level:** RF virtualization technology enables multiple vRRUs with different wireless protocols to coexist in a single pRRU.
4. **Cooperation Level:** Several virtual networks, including virtual nodes and links, are constructed to facilitate cooperative communication among multiple vRRUs, which helps in inter-cell interference elimination.

### 2.3 SDN Control Strategy
We adopt a flow-based centralized control method. The controller dynamically optimizes the virtual access elements by efficiently and fairly virtualizing and allocating spectrum, computing, and storage resources. The flow-based "match-action" control strategy involves packet headers with match fields such as IP address, MAC address, and port. Each virtual access element has a unified SDN agent to resolve control flows. When an element receives a packet, it checks if the flow matches its control rules and executes the corresponding action. Different actions can be performed by different virtual access elements; for example, vBSC may route the data, while vBBU may execute power control.

### 2.4 Programmable Scheme
Current wireless networks and their instruments are complex and difficult to control and customize. OpenRAN is deeply programmable in both the control and data planes, making the RAN more controllable and evolvable. In the control plane, the SDN controller can establish or modify rules in each virtual access element, such as routing, bandwidth allocation, and setting flow priorities. In the data plane, wireless protocols are modularized in vBBUs, allowing each vBBU to choose and combine appropriate modules to implement the desired protocol, as shown in Figure 2.

## 3. Example Scenario
As illustrated in Figure 1, a carrier wants to establish a UMTS network and two GSM networks in adjacent areas. The process involves the following steps:

1. The controller estimates the resources needed for each network based on requirements and actual network characteristics.
2. The controller creates vRRUs, vBBUs, and vBSCs by allocating appropriate spectrum, computing, and storage resources via spectrum and cloud level virtualization.
3. The controller sends flows to configure data processing rules in vBSCs and deploy corresponding wireless protocols in vBBUs using the programmable scheme.
4. Since three vRRUs are distributed in neighboring cells, the controller deploys a cooperation virtual network to eliminate interferences.
5. By application-level virtualization, the controller provides an operating virtual network that meets the carrier's requirements.
