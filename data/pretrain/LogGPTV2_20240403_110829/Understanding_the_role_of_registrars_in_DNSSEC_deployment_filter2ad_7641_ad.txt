### 6.1 Registrar Policies

Table 3 presents the results of our experiment, similar in format to Table 2. At first glance, it is evident that 9 out of 10 registrars enable DNSSEC by default; the only exception is OVH, which has been previously studied. This high level of DNSSEC-by-default behavior among registrars with significant DNSSEC deployment is not surprising, but underscores the critical role that default support can play.

Secondly, we observe that a few registrars publish DNSKEYs and RRSIGs for all domains but only publish DS records for certain domains (marked ▲ in the DS column). Upon closer examination, these registrars only publish DS records for specific TLDs: Loopia for .se domains, KPN for .nl domains, and NameCheap for .com and .net domains. We contacted these three registrars to inquire about their selective publication of DS records but did not receive a clear explanation for this behavior. 

This partial-support behavior is even more pronounced with MeshDigital, which publishes DNSKEYs and RRSIGs for their domains but fails to upload DS records for almost all domains for which they are the DNS operator. A recent study [8] found that only 4 out of 60,425 domains have a DS record. The failure to upload DS records by these four registrars is concerning, as domains without published DS records cannot be validated, thus forgoing the security benefits provided by DNSSEC.

**Notes:**
- Two registrars own multiple domains used to host DNS servers: OVH owns ovh.net and anycast.me, and TransIP owns transip.net and transip.nl.
- Having a DNSKEY record published does not necessarily mean that the domain has correctly deployed DNSSEC; for example, the corresponding DS records might not be published in the parent zone.
- One registrar stated that they do not automatically sign domains for all TLDs at present but may do so in the future.

Next, we examine how well these registrars support DNSSEC when the domain owners (registrants) themselves are the DNS operators. Overall, we find similar behavior to the popular registrars examined earlier: while a higher fraction of these registrars support DNSSEC when the owner is the DNS operator (8 out of 10), only four of them allow for web-based uploads, while the other four require unauthenticated emails with DS records. In a discussion with an administrator of one of the registrars, we were informed that their decision not to support DS records for external nameservers is intentional, aimed at preventing potential errors when domain owners manually copy and paste the DS record. This demonstrates that at least one registrar is aware of the error-prone nature of current DS record upload mechanisms.

### 6.2 Registrars vs. Resellers

We have observed that different registrars have varying DNSSEC policies. To understand why various registrars have chosen their policies and to quantify their effect on DNSSEC deployment, we conducted a longitudinal study for each registrar. Our questions included:
1. How do different DNSSEC policies affect deployment?
2. Do registrars have consistent DNSSEC policies for domains in different TLDs?
3. If they have different policies, why do they differ?

A given registrar may serve as a registrar for certain TLDs (e.g., accredited to update the registry), a reseller for others (e.g., working with a partner registrar to facilitate registration), or may not support other TLDs. For a reseller to support DNSSEC, both it and its partner registrar must support DNSSEC (i.e., generate DNSKEYs and RRSIGs, and support the uploading of DS records). Understanding the role of registrars for various TLDs is crucial to comprehending their behavior.

**Table 4** shows the 11 DNS operators that support DNSSEC for hosted domains and the registrar they use for various TLDs. Some operators are registrars themselves (white background), some are resellers using registrars (grey background), and some do not support certain TLDs (red background).

To answer these questions, we conducted a small survey, asking the 10 registrars whether they support each of the five TLDs we studied and the identity of the third-party registrars (if any) for each TLD. The results, shown in Table 4, indicate that some registrars are registrars for all TLDs (e.g., OVH and GoDaddy), while others are resellers for various TLDs. Additionally, several registrars do not support the .nl and .se TLDs at all.

### 6.3 Financial Incentives

One common criticism of DNSSEC is its slow deployment. One potential way registries could incentivize greater DNSSEC deployment is by providing discounts for domains that properly support DNSSEC. We focused on the .nl and .se TLDs, which have the highest fraction of DNSSEC-enabled domains [12] and provide registrars with discounts for DNSSEC-enabled domains. We compared registrar behavior regarding .nl and .se to .com, .net, and .org to explore whether financial incentives serve as a useful tool to incentivize DNSSEC deployment.

For .nl domains, a registrar receives a €0.28 (∼$0.30) discount annually for a .nl domain if it is correctly DNSSEC signed [9, 42]. Similarly, for .se domains, a registrar used to receive a 10 SEK (∼$1.10) discount annually for a correctly-signed .se domain [18], though it is unclear if this discount is still active. To facilitate these discounts, every DNSSEC-signed .nl and .se second-level domain is tested daily by the registry to ensure it has correct DNSKEYs, RRSIGs, and DS records [9, 37]. Registrars with many incorrectly configured DNSSEC records may not receive future discounts.

To study how registrars behave when DNSSEC is incentivized, we focused on six registrars from the Netherlands (TransIP, PCExtreme, Antagonist, and KPN) and Sweden (Loopia and Binero). We grouped registrars with similar behavior together.

**KPN and Loopia:**
Figure 5 shows the fraction of domains with DNSKEY and DS records. Interestingly, Loopia only supports DNSSEC for .se domains, and KPN only supports DNSSEC for .nl domains. None of the domains they operate in other TLDs have DNSSEC deployed. There could be two reasons for this:
1. Their registrar partners might not support DNSSEC.
2. They enable DNSSEC only if there is a financial incentive.

To test our hypothesis, we purchased a .com domain from Loopia and asked them to serve as the DNS operator. Loopia automatically published DNSKEYs and RRSIGs for our domain but did not upload a DS record to the .com registry, making DNSSEC only partially deployed. However, when we registered a .com domain through Loopia and used an external nameserver, Loopia was able to upload a DS record for our external domain. We repeated the same experiment with KPN and found the same behavior: they published DNSKEYs and RRSIGs by default but only uploaded a DS record after we requested it. This suggests that financial incentives likely play a role in registrar policies, as they clearly have the capability to upload DS records but only do so by default for domains where there is a financial incentive.

**Antagonist and Binero:**
Figure 6 shows the percentage of domains with DNSSEC and the number of domains operated by Antagonist and Binero. Both registrars support DNSSEC for all TLDs, but we observe two phenomena. First, the percentage of domains with DNSSEC is much higher for .nl and .se domains, suggesting that financial incentives may have encouraged their adoption. Specifically, 95.4% of .nl domains from Antagonist and 92.9% of .se domains from Binero have DNSSEC deployed. However, the DNSSEC adoption rates for other TLDs are much lower: 52.7% for Antagonist and 37.8% for Binero in our latest snapshots.

Second, we observe that Antagonist’s DNSSEC adoption rate has rapidly increased in all three other TLDs. However, the number of domains for which these two registrars are the DNS operator is increasing much more slowly, suggesting that the registrars have been enabling DNSSEC for existing customers. In an email exchange with Antagonist [24], we were informed that they are a reseller for .com, .net, and .org and switched their .com, .net, and .org partner from Direct to OpenProvider in December 2014. The actual domain migration to a new registrar can only happen at the end of the current registration period, explaining the gradual DNSSEC deployment. This example highlights the complex relationship between resellers and registrars, which can result in slow DNSSEC deployment.

**TransIP and PCExtreme:**
Finally, we examined the two remaining registrars that serve as resellers: TransIP and PCExtreme. Figure 7 shows the percentage of domains with DNSSEC managed by these two. First, we note that these registrars support DNSSEC very well; PCExtreme enabled DNSSEC support in March 2015, and the percentage of DNSSEC-enabled .com, .net, and .org domains jumped from 0.44% to 98.3% in 10 days, even though they are a reseller for all three TLDs. This high level of DNSSEC support has largely continued, with 97.0% of all their domains in these TLDs having DS and DNSKEY records in our latest snapshot. Second, TransIP shows an average 99.2% adoption rate of DNSSEC for TLDs when they are the registrar (.com, .net, .org, and .nl), but only 48.4% when they are a reseller.
