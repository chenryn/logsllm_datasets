focus on the 12 most popular nameserver domains, representing 10
different registrars18; they collectively cover 81.6% of the domains
with DNSKEYs.19
6.1 Registrar policies
Table 3 shows the results of this experiment in a format similar to
Table 2. At a first glance, we notice that 9 of 10 registrars enable
DNSSEC by default; the only exception is OVH (previously studied).
This high level of DNSSEC-by-default behavior for registrars with
high levels of DNSSEC deployment is not surprising, but shows the
crucial role that default support can play. Second, we observe that a
few registrars publish DNSKEYs and RRSIGs for all domains, but only
publish DS records for some domains (marked ▲ in the DS column).
Taking a closer look at these registrars, we find that they only publish
DS records for certain TLDs: Loopia only publishes DS records for
.se domains, KPN only publishes DS records for .nl domains, and
NameCheap only publishes DS records for .com and .net domains.
We emailed all three registrars to inquire why they fail to publish DS
records for some TLDs, but were unable to get a precise explanation
of this behavior.20 We observe this partial-support behavior to an
even larger degree with MeshDigital, which publishes DNSKEYs and
RRSIGs for their domains but fails to upload a DS record for almost
all domains for which they are the DNS operator; this is in line with
recent study [8] showing that only 4 domains out of 60,425 have
a DS record. We find the failure to upload DS records by these four
registrars curious, as domains where DS records are not published
cannot be validated, foregoing the security that DNSSEC provides.
18Two of the registrars own multiple domains used to host DNS
servers: OVH owns ovh.net and anycast.me, and TransIP owns
transip.net and transip.nl.
19Note that having a DNSKEY record published does not neces-
sarily mean that the domain has correctly deployed DNSSEC; e.g.,
the corresponding DS records might not be published in the parent
zone.
20For example, one of the registrars repeatedly said that they do
not sign domains automatically for all TLDs at the current time, but
might starting doing so in the future.
Next, we examine how well these registrars support DNSSEC
when the domain owners (registrants) themselves are the DNS op-
erator. Overall, we find similar behavior to the popular registrars
examined in the previous section: while a higher fraction of these
registrars support DNSSEC when the owner is the DNS operator
(8 of 10 registrars do so), only four of them allow for web-based
uploads, while the other four require unauthenticated emails with
DS records. In fact, in a discussion with an administrator of one of
the registrars, we were informed that their decision not to support DS
records for external nameservers is intentional and meant to prevent
potential errors when domain owners copy and paste the DS record
manually (i.e., avoiding cases where domain owners accidentally
upload an incorrect DS record and make their entire zone unavailable
to DNSSEC-supporting clients). This demonstrates that at least one
registrar is aware that current DS record upload mechanisms are
error-prone.
6.2 Registrars vs. resellers
So far, we have observed that different registrars have different
DNSSEC policies. Now we dig deeper and attempt to explain why
various registrars have chosen their policies and quantify their effect
on DNSSEC deployment. To this end, we perform a longitudinal
study for each registrar to answer questions that include: (1) how
does different DNSSEC policies affect deployment of DNSSEC?
(2) do registrars have consistent DNSSEC policies for domains in
different TLDs? and (3) if they have different policies, why do they
differ?
Recall that a given registrar may serve as a registrar for certain
TLDs (e.g., is accredited to update the registry), may serve as a
reseller for others (e.g., works with a partner registrar to facilitate
registration), and may simply not support other TLDs. Thus, if a
given registrar is a reseller and wishes to support DNSSEC, both it
and its partner registrar must support DNSSEC (i.e., it must generate
DNSKEYs and RRSIGs, and its partner registrar must support the up-
loading of DS records). It is therefore crucial to understand the role
that registrars play for various TLDs to understand their behavior.

Table 4: Table showing the 11 DNS operators that support DNSSEC for hosted domains, and the registrar they use for various TLDs.
In many cases, these operators are registrars themselves (white background); in other cases, these operators are resellers and use
registrars (shown with grey background); finally, some DNS operators do not support certain TLDs (shown with red background).
To answer these questions, we performed a small survey. We
asked the 10 registrars whether they support each of the five TLDs we
studied, and asked them for the identity of the third-party registrars
(if one is used) for each TLD. Table 4 shows the results of this survey,
listing whether each registrar serves as a registrar or a reseller for
each of the TLDs. As we can see, some registrars are registrars for
all TLDs (e.g., OVH and GoDaddy), while others are resellers for
various TLDs; additionally, a number of the registrars do not support
the .nl and .se TLDs at all.
6.3 Financial incentives
A common criticism of DNSSEC has been the slow deployment. One
potential way registries could incentivize greater DNSSEC deploy-
ment is by providing discounts for domains that properly support
DNSSEC. We now focus on the .nl and .se TLDs, which are the
TLDs with the largest fraction of DNSSEC-enabled domains [12]
and which provide registrars a discount for DNSSEC-enabled do-
mains. We compare the registrar behavior w.r.t .nl and .se to behav-
ior w.r.t .com, .net, and .org to explore whether financial incentives
serve as a useful tool to incentivize DNSSEC deployment.
For .nl domains, a registrar receives a e0.28 (∼$0.30) discount
every year for a .nl domain if it is correctly DNSSEC signed [9, 42].
Similarly, for .se domains, a registrar used to receive a 10 SEK
(∼$1.10) discount every year for a correctly-signed .se domain [18]
(it is unclear whether this discount is still active at this time). To fa-
cilitate these discounts, every DNSSEC-signed .nl and .se second-
level domain is tested every day by the registry to ensure it has cor-
rect DNSKEYs, RRSIGs, and DS records [9, 37]. Registrars that have
many incorrectly configured DNSSEC records21 may not receive
future discounts.
To study how registrars behave when DNSSEC is incentivized,
we focus on the six registrars that are from the Netherlands (TransIP,
PCExtreme, Antagonist, and KPN) and Sweden (Loopia and Binero).
We group registrars that have similar behavior together.
KPN and Loopia Figure 5 shows the fraction of the domains with
DNSKEY and DS records. Interestingly, we find that Loopia only sup-
ports DNSSEC for .se domains, and KPN only supports DNSSEC
21For example, the .nl registry states that registrars should not
fail validations more than 14 times in six months.
for .nl domains (in fact, none of the domains that they are the DNS
operator for in other TLDs have DNSSEC deployed). There could be
two potential reasons why KPN and Loopia support DNSSEC only
for .nl and .se domains, respectively, and not the others: (1) their
registrar partners might not support DNSSEC, or (2) they enable
DNSSEC only if there is a financial incentive.
To test our hypothesis, we purchased a .com domain from Loopia
and asked them to serve as the DNS operator. We observed that
Loopia automatically published DNSKEYs and RRSIG for our domain,
but did not upload a DS record to the .com registry (thereby making
DNSSEC for our domain only partially deployed). However, when
we registered a .com domain through Loopia and used an external
nameserver, Loopia was able to upload a DS record for our external
domain. We repeated the same experiment with KPN and found
exactly the same behavior: they published DNSKEYs and RRSIGs by
default, but only uploaded a DS record after we requested it. The
take-away from this experiment is that financial incentives are likely

(b) Binero (*.binero.se)

to play a role in registrar policies: the registrars clearly have the
capability to upload DS records, but only do so by default for domains
where there is a financial incentive.
Antagonist and Binero Next, we turn to two other registrars that
show similar behavior. Figure 6 shows the percentage of domains
with DNSSEC (bottom) and the number of domains (top) that are
operated by Antagonist and Binero. Both of these registrars support
DNSSEC for all TLDs, but we observe two phenomena. First, the
percentage of domains with DNSSEC is much higher for .nl and
.se domains, suggesting that the financial incentives may have
encouraged their adoption. In fact, 95.4% of .nl domains from
Antagonist and 92.9% of .se domains from Binero have DNSSEC
deployed. However, the DNSSEC adoption ratios in other domains

record for PCExtreme and TransIP. Both of them have de-
ployed DNSSEC for almost of their domains, but the DNSSEC
adoption rate for the .se domains from TransIP is lower than
the others due to the partial DNSSEC support of its registration
partner (i.e., KeySystems).
are much lower: 52.7% for Antagonist, and 37.8% for Binero in our
latest snapshots.
Second, we observe that Antagonist’s DNSSEC adoption rate
has rapidly increased in all three other TLDs. However, the number
of domains for which these two registrars are the DNS operator is
increasing much more slowly (bottom graph), suggesting that the
registrars have been enabling DNSSEC for existing customers. In an
email exchange with Antagonist [24], we were informed that they
are a reseller for .com, .net, and .org, and that they switched their
.com, .net, and .org partner from Direct to OpenProvider in order
to support DNSSEC in December 2014. However, the actual domain
migration to a new registrar can only happen at the end of the current
registration period of a domain, explaining why Antagonist shows
gradual DNSSEC deployment. Overall, this example shows that the
complex relationship between reseller and registrar can also result
in slow deployment of DNSSEC.
TransIP and PCExtreme Next, we examine the two remaining
registrars that serve as resellers: TransIP and PCExtreme. Figure 7
shows the percentage of domains with DNSSEC that are managed by
these two. First, we note that these two registrars support DNSSEC
very well; PCExtreme clearly enabled support for DNSSEC in March
2015 and the percentage of DNSSEC enabled .com, .net, and .org
domains jumped from 0.44% to 98.3% in 10 days, even though
they are a reseller for all three TLDs. Moreover, this high level of
DNSSEC support has largely continued: in our latest snapshot, we
observe that 97.0% of all their domains in these TLDs have DS and
DNSKEY records. Second, TransIP shows an average 99.2% adoption
rate of DNSSEC for the TLDs when they are themselves a registrar
(.com, .net, .org, and .nl), but only 48.4% adoption rate when
