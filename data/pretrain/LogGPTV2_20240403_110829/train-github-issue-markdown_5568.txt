##### Detailed description
I compiled the open-cv with gstreamer support, and I tried to freeze my python
codes with cx_freeze / pyinstaller. It prompt success whild freezing. But when
I try to run the binary file, it prompted as follow:
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cx_Freeze/initscripts/__startup__.py", line 14, in run
        module.run()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cx_Freeze/initscripts/Console.py", line 26, in run
        exec(code, m.__dict__)
      File "/tmp/tmpe6jo_q_3/scripts/my_own_scripts.py", line 14, in 
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cv2/__init__.py", line 89, in 
        bootstrap()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cv2/__init__.py", line 58, in bootstrap
        load_first_config(['config.py'], True)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/cv2/__init__.py", line 56, in load_first_config
        raise ImportError('OpenCV loader: missing configuration file: {}. Check OpenCV installation.'.format(fnames))
    ImportError: OpenCV loader: missing configuration file: ['config.py']. Check OpenCV installation.
This error is not existed if I use open-cv with  
`pip install opencv-python`  
However, I need the gstream support for open-cv, so I have to compile it
myself.  
Please help me to check whether it is a bug or not. Thank you

##### Steps to reproduce
  1. compile opencv as guided
  2. compose a python scripts to include opencv
    import cv2
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        print("Hello, world!")
  3. freeze it with cx_freeze of pyinstaller
  4. execute the binay.
