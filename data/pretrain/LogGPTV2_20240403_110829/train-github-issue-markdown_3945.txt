Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
When using AggressiveSplittingPlugin, 2 problems. Firstly it doesn't work
unless you also include "CommonsChunkPlugin", as this then has the bootstrap
code, (webpackJsonp etc). Also if not using "CommonsChunkPlugin" duplicates
are created. eg. If say I used PouchDB twice in 2 entry points I get 2 350k
files,..
But the biggest problem, if you have more than 1 entry point using Watch mode,
first compile is fine, successive compiles give errors like ->
    ERROR in chunk 1 [entry]
    8a7cd0cd2cc5f21ec12a.js
    Conflict: Multiple assets emit to the same filename 8a7cd0cd2cc5f21ec12a.js
    ERROR in chunk 3 [initial]
    93a8d32df50e5f918ebe.js
    Conflict: Multiple assets emit to the same filename 93a8d32df50e5f918ebe.js
    etc.
Also worth noting, on these successive compiles, it again then duplicates
files, eg. It shows 2 350k files again, like when not using
"CommonsChunkPlugin".
A temporary solution while developing in watch mode only have 1 entry point,
and only work on this. Once you are happy re-include all entry points and do a
full compile again.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
Create a project with 2 entry points, start compile in watch mode.  
Now modify a file to cause a recompile.
**What is the expected behavior?**
It works like the first compile, and doesn't error.
