I have a dialog with a table in it that requires scrolling. The table contains
a column that contains icons with tooltips. Everything is okay when tooltip
placement='bottom'. When I change placement to 'right' an additional scrolling
bar appears inside the dialog.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Same as with Tooltip placement='bottom'
