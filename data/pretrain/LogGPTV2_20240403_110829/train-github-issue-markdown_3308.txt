One project I'm working on has three different places where I need to pass
options to 6to5. There's the test suite that runs ES6 code with
`6to5/register`, the Gulpfile that builds ES5 code that I can `npm publish`,
and the REPL.
Keeping all three in sync is not easy, especially when configurations change
(e.g. just released 3.0). What about having all three reading their
configuration from the same file?
