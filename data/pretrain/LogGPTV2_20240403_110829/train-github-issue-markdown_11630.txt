### Issue Description

- **Electron Version:** 1.2.5
- **Operating System:** Mac OS X El Capitan

When sending IPC (Inter-Process Communication) messages between the renderer and the main process, I have observed that sometimes duplicate messages are received.

### Questions

1. **Reliability of IPC in Electron:**
   - What level of reliability does Electron ensure for IPC messages? 
   - Are there any built-in mechanisms to prevent or handle duplicate messages?

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Should we implement our own de-duplication logic to handle cases where the same message is re-sent?
   - If so, what best practices or strategies are recommended for this?

### Additional Context

I previously posted this question on the Electron discussion forum a few days ago but did not receive any responses. Therefore, I am reaching out here for assistance.

### Thanks

Thank you in advance for your help!
