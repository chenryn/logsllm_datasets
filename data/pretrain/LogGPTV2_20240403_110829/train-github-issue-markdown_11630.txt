  * Electron version: 1.2.5
  * Operating system: Mac OS X el capitan
When sending IPC messages between the renderer and the main process, I think
we sometimes get duplicate messages.
What kind of reliability is ensured by Electron? Should we handle de-
duplication ourselves in the case of the same messages being re-sent?
I don't know if that's the right place for that question but I tried to post
it on the discussion forum of Electron a few days ago and nobody answered so I
am trying here.
Thanks
