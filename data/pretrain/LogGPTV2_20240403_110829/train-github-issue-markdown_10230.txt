Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

I have TypeScript code that imports several types from a single file, like this:
```typescript
import { TypeA, TypeB, TypeC } from './file';
```

It would be more convenient to import all exported types from the file using the star syntax, for example:
```typescript
import * as Types from './file';
```

This way, I can access all the types under the `Types` namespace, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.
