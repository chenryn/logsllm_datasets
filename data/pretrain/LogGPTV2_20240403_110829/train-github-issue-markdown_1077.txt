    # Actual behavior
    Selecting "settings" - Powertoys window loads for a couple of seconds and then shuts down.  I have been having this problem since Powertoys 0.11.
    Program is running in administrative mode.  Had no issues when installing.  Tried uninstalling/reinstalling, didn't fix the problem.  It works on other pc's/tablets that I own.
