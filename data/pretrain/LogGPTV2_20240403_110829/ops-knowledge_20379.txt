User: I am very very new in Python and I have a doubt.
If I write a program in a text editor (such as Nodepad++), then can I execute it from the Python shell (the one that begin with >>)? What command have I to launch to execute my Python program?
Tnx
Andrea
Assistant: from within the Python IDLE shell:
File -> Open... -> Select your Python program
When your program has openend select Run -> Run Module or press F5
