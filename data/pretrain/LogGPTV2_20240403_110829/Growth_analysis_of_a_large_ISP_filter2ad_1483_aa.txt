## Abstract
We present a time-series analysis of Cogent’s inter-continental network, based on weekly descriptions of Cogent’s routers and their interfaces collected over more than one year. These descriptions are derived from public reverse DNS records, which we cross-validate using iffinder, a full Internet scan, and limited ground truth data provided by Cogent. Our dataset, available to the research community, shows that while the number of Cogent routers grew by approximately 11.3% each week, the average number of interfaces per router and the effective diameter of the inferred network remained stable. The dataset includes information on interface types, port identifications, router locations, peer and customer attachments, and more.

## 1. Introduction
IP addresses on the Internet generally fall into two categories: they either represent hosts or other endpoints, or router interfaces. Mapping the connections and properties of router interfaces (e.g., ownership, geographic location, logical location) is crucial for understanding the Internet's topological structure and has been a subject of extensive research. Common approaches to reconstructing the router-level topology include traceroute-like probes, multicast advertisements, IP options probing, and DNS records.

DNS records can be a rich source of information, but they are potentially problematic and are not used in large-scale Internet topology mapping by CAIDA. For example, there are no standards for naming interfaces, and there is no requirement for DNS records to remain up-to-date as interfaces are added, reconfigured, or removed. However, within a single ISP, these difficulties may be mitigated due to consistent administrative procedures and best practices.

Cogent, one of the most connected Internet service providers with large networks in both Europe and North America, provides reverse DNS records for more than 99% of the 51,000+ interfaces on Cogent-owned routers. For instance:
- `te2-1.ccr01.jfk01.atlas.cogentco.com` is the reverse DNS record for the Cogent-owned IP address 154.54.80.85.
- `fa0-2.na01.b003070-1.sfo04.atlas.cogentco.com` is the reverse DNS record for the Cogent-owned IP address 38.112.5.17 during the week of March 10, 2013.

We assume that all records under the `*.atlas.cogentco.com` DNS hierarchy are part of Cogent’s infrastructure. These records provide four pieces of information:
1. Router location (e.g., `jfk01` and `sfo04`), with 460 router locations, almost all coded with three-letter airport codes.
2. Router within a location (e.g., `ccr01` and `na01.b003070-1`), with an estimated 4,469 routers the week of March 10, 2013.
3. Interface type, inferred based on Cisco naming conventions (e.g., `te` for 10 Gbps Ethernet, and `fa` for 100 Mbps Ethernet).
4. Interface position within the router (e.g., `2-1` and `0-2`, representing the first and second ports on their line cards).

Ideally, with such structured records, we could determine the existence of a 10 Gbps interface at position 2-2 on the `ccr01.jfk01` router with a simple DNS query. However, Cogent only provides reverse DNS records. By issuing reverse DNS queries for all Cogent-owned IPv4 addresses, we find that the IP address at position 2-2 on that router is 154.54.25.17. Additionally, this router appears to have 18 such 10 Gbps interfaces configured across five line cards.

Other Cogent DNS records include information about related business entities. For example, `Tetratech.demarc.cogentco.com` is the reverse DNS record for 38.112.5.18, indicating that Tetratech is connected to Cogent with up to 100 Mbps of available bandwidth at a router near San Francisco, based on the information about 38.112.5.17 (the other usable address in the 38.112.5.16/30 subnet) inferred above.

To leverage this wealth of information, we have issued reverse DNS queries each week for more than 17 million Cogent-owned IPv4 addresses (now more than 20 million, see §4.3), starting the week of January 22, 2012. These weekly snapshots allow us to analyze the growth and changes in Cogent’s network at the router level.

This dataset, released to the research community, has several interesting features:
- Extensive records of the evolution of a large ISP, providing a platform for future network research—either directly using the dataset or by offering improvements to existing topology generators.
