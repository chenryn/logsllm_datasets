ABSTRACT
We present a time-series analysis of Cogent’s inter-continental net-
work. The analysis is based on descriptions of Cogent’s routers and
their interfaces, collected each week for more than one year. These
descriptions are collected from public reverse DNS records, which
we cross-validate using iffinder, a full Internet scan, and limited
ground truth data provided by Cogent. For example, our dataset,
which we make available to the research community, shows that
while the number of Cogent routers grew by approximately 11.3
each week, the average number of interfaces per router, and the ef-
fective diameter of the inferred network remained stable over the
same period. Our collected dataset includes information about in-
terface types, port identiﬁcations, router locations, peer and cus-
tomer attachments, and more.

INTRODUCTION
Broadly speaking, IP addresses on the Internet fall into one of
two categories – they either represent hosts or other endpoints, or
router interfaces. Mapping the connections between, and proper-
ties of, the router interfaces (e.g., ownership, geographic location,
logical location, etc.) is important for understanding the Internet’s
topological structure, and has been a topic of extensive research
(cf., §2). Typical mapping approaches to reconstruct the router-
level topology of the Internet include data from traceroute-like
probes [25], multicast advertisements [20], IP options probing [9,
21], and DNS records [24].
As shown below, DNS records can be a rich source of informa-
tion; yet, they are potentially problematic [27], and are not used in
large-scale Internet topology mapping performed by CAIDA [16].

For example, there are no standards for naming interfaces (result-
ing in idiosyncratic rules for each ISP), and there is no require-
ment that an interface’s DNS record remain up-to-date as interfaces
are added, reconﬁgured, or removed. Within a single ISP, however,
such difﬁculties may be mitigated, as organizations presumably
strive for consistent administrative procedures and best practices.
We ﬁnd that Cogent, one of the most connected Internet service
providers [1], with large networks in both Europe and North Amer-
ica, is such an ISP. Cogent provides reverse DNS records for more
than 99% of the 51,000+ interfaces on Cogent-owned routers we
could identify. For example,
te2-1.ccr01.jfk01.atlas.cogentco.com
fa0-2.na01.b003070-1.sfo04.atlas.cogentco.com
are, respectively, the reverse DNS records for the Cogent-owned IP
addresses 154.54.80.85 and 38.112.5.17 during the week of
March 10, 2013.
We assume that all records under the *.atlas.cogentco.com
DNS hierarchy are part of Cogent’s infrastructure.1 These records
include four pieces of information. First, a router location (e.g.,
jfk01 and sfo04) – we ﬁnd Cogent has 460 router locations, al-
most all of which are coded with three-letter airport codes. Second,
the router within a location (e.g., ccr01 and na01.b003070-1) –
we estimate Cogent had 4,469 routers the week of March 10, 2013.
Third, the type of interface, which we infer based on Cisco naming
conventions (e.g., te for 10 Gbps Ethernet, and fa for 100 Mbps
Ethernet). And fourth, the interface’s position within the router
(e.g., 2-1 and 0-2, which are, respectively, the ﬁrst and second
ports on their line cards).
Ideally, with such structured records, we could determine the ex-
istence of a 10 Gbps interface at position 2-2 on the ccr01.jfk01
router with a simple DNS query. Unfortunately, Cogent only pro-
vides reverse DNS records. However, by issuing reverse DNS queries
for all Cogent-owned IPv4 addresses, we ﬁnd that the IP address at
position 2-2 on that router is 154.54.25.17. In addition, because
of the exhaustive lookup, we ﬁnd that this router appears to have 18
such 10 Gbps interfaces conﬁgured across ﬁve line cards.
Other Cogent DNS records include information about related
business entities. For example, Tetratech.demarc.cogentco.com
is the reverse DNS record for 38.112.5.18; hence, we infer that
Tetratech is connected to Cogent with up to 100 Mbps of avail-
able bandwidth at a router near San Francisco, based on the in-
formation about 38.112.5.17 (the other usable address in the
38.112.5.16/30 subnet) inferred above.
To capitalize on this wealth of information, we have issued re-
verse DNS queries each week for more than 17 million Cogent-
owned IPv4 addresses (now more than 20 million, see §4.3), start-
1Excluding approximately a dozen mis-named addresses such as
fixme_please.atlas.cogentco.com.
ing the week of January 22, 2012. These weekly snapshots allow
us to analyze the growth of – and change in – Cogent’s network at
the router-level.
This dataset, which we release to the research community, has
several interesting features:
• Extensive records of the evolution of a large ISP, providing
a platform for future network research – either directly using
the dataset, or by offering improvements to existing topology
generators [26]
