Question: "A security engineer is evaluating a pseudorandom number generator (pRNG) for use in a cryptosystem that will generate both secret keys and initialization vectors (IVs) for symmetric encryption. Which of the following properties should the engineer ensure the pRNG possesses to prevent an attacker, who might learn the internal state after some output has been generated, from deducing the value of previously generated secret keys?"
 "A": "Deterministic output"
 "B": "Rollback resistance"
 "C": "High entropy source"
 "D": "Stateless output generation"
Answer: B
