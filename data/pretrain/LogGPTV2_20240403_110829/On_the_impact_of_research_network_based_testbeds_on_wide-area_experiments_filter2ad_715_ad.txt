Figure 12: TCP throughput measurements for G2G and C2C paths using Iperf.
C2G and C2C paths. We determined that this was due to
the access link of one of the nodes (ATT) being limited to
approx. 10Mbps. While this limited the bandwidth of C2C
and C2G paths, the corresponding paired GREN node at
Princeton did not have this limitation and thus the G2C
paths have higher bandwidth. Figure 13(c) also shows that
the loss rates of G2C and C2G paths are higher than those
of G2G paths.
Finally, Figure 13(f) shows the TCP throughput achieved
on each of these paths which most closely indicates how dis-
tributed systems and network services will perform over the
testbed and takes into account collectively all path prop-
erties like RTT, loss and available bandwidth. The results
show that the throughput achieved on G2C, C2G and C2C
paths for most of the measured paths are similar, while G2G
paths have higher throughputs.
5.3.1 Relative Change Metric
We also measure the relative change of G2C and C2G
paths compared to the corresponding C2C and G2G paths.
The relative change for a G2C path compared to a G2G
path for metric I is deﬁned as
and the same
compared to a C2C path is deﬁned as
IG2C
larly, we deﬁne a similar metric for a C2G path.
|IG2C−IG2G|
|IG2C−IC2C|
. Simi-
IG2C
Table 3 depicts the relative change for diﬀerent metrics for
G2C and C2G paths compared to G2G and C2C paths. The
results demonstrate that the capacity, available bandwidth
and throughputs of both G2C and C2G paths have a much
smaller relative change when compared to C2C paths than
G2G paths. Further, the RTTs of G2C and C2G paths are
equally close to G2G and C2C paths. Finally, the loss rates
of G2C and C2G paths are slightly closer to C2C paths than
G2G paths.
In summary, all traﬃc ﬂows that contain at least one com-
mercial network connected endpoint are more representative
of network conditions in the commercial Internet and can
be used to evaluate applications deployed over the testbed.
Thus, C2G, G2C and C2C are representative of commercial
networks. We now study the impact of mixed testbeds on
applications being evaluated.
6.
IMPACT ON APPLICATION
PERFORMANCE
Sections 4 and 5 show that the representativeness of traf-
ﬁc ﬂow scenarios when an application is deployed over a
mixed testbed is aﬀected since when two GREN nodes com-
municate with each other resulting in overall better perfor-
mance properties than that experienced by entirely commer-
cial ﬂows. Since the performance properties can aﬀect the
application performance in complex ways, in this section,
we measure the ﬁnal impact on the application performance
metric via application case studies. The applications are
chosen such that they depend on and stress diﬀerent perfor-
mance properties.
6.1 Application-Layer Multicast
The ﬁrst application we evaluate is the popular application-
layer multicast. There are several diﬀerent protocols pro-
posed for providing application-layer multicast. This appli-
