## Abstract
Internet-wide scans are a common active measurement technique used to study various aspects of the Internet, such as security properties and protocol adoption. These scans involve probing large address ranges (IPv4 or parts of IPv6) for specific ports or protocols. While primarily used for these purposes, we demonstrate that these scans also provide valuable insights into the Internet's control plane through the ICMP responses they generate—a currently underexplored secondary use. We collected one week of ICMP responses (approximately 637.50 million messages) from several Internet-wide ZMap scans covering multiple TCP and UDP ports, as well as DNS-based scans covering over 50% of the domain name space. This perspective enables us to study the Internet's control plane as a by-product of these measurements. Our dataset includes ICMP messages from approximately 171 million unique IP addresses across roughly 53,000 different autonomous systems. Additionally, we uncover multiple control plane issues, such as outdated and misconfigured routers and the presence of large-scale persistent routing loops in IPv4.

## 1. Introduction
Internet scans are a widely used and valuable approach to understand and track the evolution of the Internet, one of the most complex systems ever created by humans. These scans are applied in various fields, including networking and security research, to find vulnerable systems, measure the liveness of IP addresses, and assess the deployability and evolution of new protocols and features. Advances in scanning methodologies have enabled the probing of the entire IPv4 address space for a single port within minutes or hours, depending on available bandwidth and scan rate. Tools like ZMap and MASSCAN have made regular scans of the entire IPv4 address space feasible, providing insights into protocol evolution, such as QUIC. While these scan-based works have contributed significantly to our understanding of the Internet's structure and evolution, they typically focus on a specific feature or protocol as their primary objective.

In this work, we argue that Internet-wide scans have an underexplored secondary use: studying the Internet's control plane while scanning for their primary purpose. For example, while primarily probing for QUIC-capable servers, we can detect routing loops. Specifically, we analyze ICMP responses generated as a by-product of non-ICMP probe packets (e.g., QUIC) and show that these responses provide a rich dataset that is currently neglected. This allows us to study the Internet's control plane without requiring dedicated scans, which would increase the scanning footprint.

Our observations are based on regular ZMap scans of the IPv4 address space for multiple TCP and UDP ports, as well as DNS-based scans of top lists and zone files for TLS, HTTP/2, and QUIC. We evaluate one full week of ICMP responses to multi-protocol Internet scans covering the entire IPv4 address space and over 50% of the domain name space.

## 2. Scan Infrastructure and Dataset
### 2.1 Infrastructure
Our scans are conducted using two different modes:
1. **ZMap Scans:** We use the ZMap port scanner on multiple machines to perform various scans over the course of a week.
2. **DNS-Based Scans:** We continuously probe over 50% of the DNS space using our own resolver infrastructure.

Table 1 summarizes our weekly scan schedule, which is the result of ongoing research efforts rather than being specifically created for this paper.

| Day       | Monday   | Tuesday  | Wednesday | Thursday  | Friday    | Saturday  | Sunday    |
|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Source    | DNS      | Alexa    | 1% IPv4   | Protocols & Ports | TCP/80, TCP/443 | TCP/443, gQUIC/443 | IPv4, TCP/80, iQUIC/443, gQUIC/443, TCP/443 |

These scans typically involve scanning TCP/80 for TCP initial window configurations or TCP fast open support, TCP/443 for HTTP/2 support and TLS, and UDP 443 for Google QUIC (gQUIC) and IETF-QUIC (iQUIC). Our DNS-based scans use our own resolvers to resolve various record types for domains listed in zone files of multiple TLDs (e.g., .com, .net, .org), and we use A-records to investigate TLS, HTTP/2, and gQUIC.

All scans, including DNS resolutions, originate from a dedicated subnet. To collect all ICMP traffic directed towards these hosts, we install a mirror port at their uplink switch and filter it to only include ICMP traffic belonging to our measurement network. Since we do not generate ICMP messages ourselves, we exclude ping responses, leaving us with only incoming ICMP traffic.

### 2.2 Dataset
Our observations are based on one full week in September 2018. During this week, we received 169 GB of data, corresponding to approximately 637.50 million ICMPv4 messages (excluding those explicitly triggered in Section 4). ICMP messages follow the structure shown in Figure 1, consisting of a type field and a code field, with additional information depending on their values.

## 3. Study of ICMP Responses
### 3.1 Distribution of ICMP Message Types
We first summarize the ICMP responses to our scans by examining the distribution of ICMP message types and their frequency of occurrence, as shown in Table 2. We observed 75 different ICMP type/code combinations during our observation period, with significantly different occurrence frequencies. While most messages are standardized, some fall under the "Other" category, which we do not focus on in this paper.

Figure 2 provides a temporal context for the data in Table 2, showing the rolling sum over 1-hour intervals of the major ICMP types. We observe that ICMP traffic varies over the course of the week, with echo requests remaining relatively static and other types, like destination unreachable, following our ZMap scan schedule.

![ICMP Messages per Hour and Type](figure2.png)
*Figure 2. Number of ICMP messages received per hour and type over the course of a week. Note the log scale and the rolling sum over 1-hour intervals.*

### 3.2 Quoted IP Packets
Many ICMP messages contain parts of the packet that caused the creation of the message. We further inspect these quoted IPv4 packets within the ICMP messages. From all received ICMP messages, 99.5% are supposed to contain IP packets (according to the RFCs), with only 0.07% undecodable. Of the decodable packets, we find 180.25 million unique source IP/payload length combinations, with 76% longer than 40 bytes (enough to inspect IP and TCP headers when no options are used) and 24% exactly 28 bytes long (enough to inspect transport ports). This extends the finding in [26] that showed a prevalence of 28-byte responses for TCP traceroutes.

Next, we focus on the destination address field within the quoted IP header. These should correspond to addresses targeted by our scanners. Interestingly, we find over 1.06 million messages with destination IPs in reserved address space, suggesting these messages are produced behind NATs. We use the contained source addresses to understand the relation to our measurements.

### 3.3 Responses to Individual Measurements
Since we perform a variety of different measurements independent of this study, we investigate how different measurements affect the generation of ICMP traffic. We compare two ZMap scans (one enumerating reachable TCP port 80 and UDP port 443 hosts) and a purely DNS-based scan (probing for HTTP/2 support via TCP port 443). We can clearly tie the ICMP messages to the different scans via IPs and ports either from the quoted IP message or from the IP itself.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of ICMP types and codes (top 8) that we receive for the respective scans. As indicated by Table 2, we receive a large amount of destination unreachable messages, but their amount and share vary depending on the scan.

## 4. Unreachable Hosts and Routing Loops
Driven by our findings, we inspect unreachable hosts due to routing loops and quantify their presence in today’s Internet. We find that a significant number of networks and hosts are unreachable, with large sets of unreachable address space due to routing loops.

## 5. Related Work
We discuss related works in this section, highlighting previous studies that have explored similar areas and comparing our findings with existing literature.

## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate that Internet-wide scans have a valuable secondary use in studying the Internet's control plane through the ICMP responses they generate. Our dataset, collected over one week, provides rich insights into the Internet's control plane, revealing numerous misconfigurations and issues such as routing loops. We make our dataset available at [https://icmp.netray.io](https://icmp.netray.io) and encourage further research in this area.
