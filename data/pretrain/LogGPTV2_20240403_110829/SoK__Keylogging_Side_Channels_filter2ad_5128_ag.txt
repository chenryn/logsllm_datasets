A. Keystroke Dataset Details
APPENDIX
The dataset used to estimate information gain from a tempo-
ral side channel in Section III-C comes from a previous study
that aimed to detect deceptive reviews and essays [45]. Each
of the 1060 subjects were instructed to write genuine and fake
reviews and then separately transcribe the responses within a
web browser. For our analysis, only the free-text portion of the
dataset was used to estimate information gain. We also applied
the additional constraints of: discarding non-letter characters,
discarding words that contain any modiﬁer keys (e.g., Shift or
Ctrl, to eliminate uppercase words and command inputs), and
discarding words with any duration or latency >1 s. Only
then were the bigrams within each word considered. This
resulted in 1650±1046 (72±29 unique) bigrams per user. Our
temporal information gain estimates are lower than those in
[8], suggesting that context plays an import role in typing
behavior (a phenomenon also noted by Salthouse [43]).
Some remarks on overlapping keystrokes are also warranted.
Many keylogging attacks have operated under the assumption
that keystrokes are non-overlapping and have an approximate
duration of 100 ms (e.g., [39], [54], [56]–[59]). In practice,
this is seldom the case except for some typists. In the same
keystroke dataset described above, considering only alphanu-
meric keys (discarding modiﬁer keys), more than 20% of all
keystrokes are overlapping, i.e., tR
i+1 for successive
keystrokes. This also varies by typist, with some users having
as high as 67% and 69% of all keystrokes overlapping for free
and transcribed input, respectively. Only 20 users out of 1060,
less than 2%, don’t have any overlapping keystrokes.

B. Summary of Public Keystroke Datasets
We believe that access to public keystroke datasets can help
facilitate future keylogging research, especially with respect
temporal side channels. In general, real-world keylogging data
is difﬁcult to access and contains sensitive information [139].
Instead, we have identiﬁed over 30 public keystroke datasets
from ﬁelds including biometrics, human-computer interaction,
and affective computing. These are summarized in Table IV
and characterized by the following attributes.
1) Locale: The locale reﬂects the country or region where
the dataset was collected, which is either inferred from the
respective reference or provided by the user agent string if
available. The locale reﬂects both the physical layout (e.g., ISO
vs ANSI) and logical layout (e.g., QWERTY vs DVORAK)
of the keyboard (see Section II-A and [140]). For example,
most US keyboards use ANSI/QWERTY; FR keyboards are
dominated by ISO/AZERTY.
2) Typing mode: The typing mode is characterized by the
acquisition context, which includes the instructions provided
to the user and any keystroke input constraints imposed by the
application and/or data collection environment. These broadly
fall into three different categories:
• Fixed: The keystrokes exactly follow a relatively short
predeﬁned sequence. The character sequence is known
beforehand and entered without errors or corrections. This
includes the entry of passwords, phone numbers, and
personal identiﬁcation numbers (PINs) without making
corrections.
• Constrained: The keystrokes roughly follow a predeﬁned
sequence, where typing errors and corrections are al-
lowed. This includes case-insensitive passwords, pass-
words that were typed with corrections (i.e., including
the Backspace key), and transcribed text. This mode
of input is used by some massively open online course
(MOOC) providers in which the student must copy sev-
eral sentences for the purpose of keystroke dynamics-
based veriﬁcation [141].
• Free: The keystrokes do not follow a predeﬁned sequence.
The character sequence is unknown beforehand and usu-
ally consists of at least several sentences. The keystrokes
collected as part of an essay question in an online exam
would be considered long free-text.
The time intervals in freely-typed text tend to follow a much
heaver tail than ﬁxed-text. These larger latencies also tend to
occur between certain keys, such as punctuation and the Space
key. Note that keystrokes refer to the sequence of keys pressed,
and the character sequence refers to the characters that are
accepted by the application, for example what ultimately
appears on screen in a text editor. The keystrokes may vary to
produce the same character sequence when typing corrections
are allowed.
3) Features: The most important features in a keystroke
dataset are the key names and timings since these reﬂect the
user’s typing behavior and provide a ground truth to evaluate
keylogger performance. The resolution and completeness of
these features varies across datasets: in Table IV, datasets
that contain key names but fail to distinguish between the
location of modiﬁer keys with multiple physical
locations
(e.g., LShift vs RShift) are marked as partial. Similarly for
the timings, datasets that are missing either the key press or
release timestamps are marked as partial.
Other features provide an opportunity to explore some of
the side channel attacks described in Section IV. Several
datasets contain audio/video recordings, which enable the
possibility of acoustic and video side channels. Physiological
features include hand motion, electrocardiography (ECG), and
electroencephalogram (EEG), among others, which provide an
opportunity to explore side channels from wearable devices,
such as ﬁtness trackers and smartwatches.
4) Attributes: Keylogging performance is subject to a num-
ber of environment variables related to the victim (e.g, age,
gender, and handedness) and the platform (e.g., the keyboard
model and timer resolution). Datasets that contain labels for
these attributes are marked as such in Table IV. See [142] for a
comprehensive review on environmental variables in keystroke
acquisition.
5) Impostor Data: Many of the datasets in Table IV were
collected with keystroke biometrics in mind and contain im-
postor data, that is a keystroke sequence recorded by a user
purporting to be the genuine user.
