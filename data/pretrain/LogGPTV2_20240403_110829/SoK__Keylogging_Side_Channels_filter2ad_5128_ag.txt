### A. Keystroke Dataset Details

The dataset utilized to estimate information gain from a temporal side channel, as discussed in Section III-C, originates from a previous study aimed at detecting deceptive reviews and essays [45]. The 1060 participants were instructed to write both genuine and fake reviews, followed by transcribing their responses within a web browser. For our analysis, only the free-text portion of the dataset was used. Additional constraints applied included discarding non-letter characters, words containing modifier keys (e.g., Shift or Ctrl), and words with any duration or latency exceeding 1 second. After these filters, bigrams within each word were considered, resulting in 1650±1046 (72±29 unique) bigrams per user. Our temporal information gain estimates are lower than those reported in [8], indicating that context significantly influences typing behavior, a phenomenon also noted by Salthouse [43].

**Remarks on Overlapping Keystrokes:**
Many keylogging attacks assume non-overlapping keystrokes with an approximate duration of 100 ms (e.g., [39], [54], [56]–[59]). In practice, this is rarely the case. In the same keystroke dataset, considering only alphanumeric keys (excluding modifier keys), more than 20% of all keystrokes are overlapping, i.e., \( t_{R_i} > t_{P_{i+1}} \) for successive keystrokes. This varies by typist, with some users having up to 67% and 69% of all keystrokes overlapping for free and transcribed input, respectively. Only 20 out of 1060 users, less than 2%, did not have any overlapping keystrokes.

### B. Summary of Public Keystroke Datasets

Access to public keystroke datasets can facilitate future keylogging research, especially regarding temporal side channels. Real-world keylogging data is often difficult to access and contains sensitive information [139]. We have identified over 30 public keystroke datasets from fields such as biometrics, human-computer interaction, and affective computing. These datasets are summarized in Table IV and characterized by the following attributes:

1. **Locale:**
   - The locale indicates the country or region where the dataset was collected, inferred from the respective reference or provided by the user agent string if available.
   - It reflects both the physical layout (e.g., ISO vs. ANSI) and logical layout (e.g., QWERTY vs. DVORAK) of the keyboard. For example, most US keyboards use ANSI/QWERTY, while French keyboards predominantly use ISO/AZERTY.

2. **Typing Mode:**
   - **Fixed:** Keystrokes follow a short, predefined sequence without errors or corrections. Examples include entering passwords, phone numbers, and PINs.
   - **Constrained:** Keystrokes roughly follow a predefined sequence, allowing for typing errors and corrections. This includes case-insensitive passwords, typed with corrections, and transcribed text. Some MOOC providers use this mode for keystroke dynamics-based verification [141].
   - **Free:** Keystrokes do not follow a predefined sequence. The character sequence is unknown beforehand and typically consists of several sentences. Examples include keystrokes from an essay question in an online exam.

3. **Features:**
   - Key names and timings are the most important features, reflecting the user's typing behavior and providing a ground truth to evaluate keylogger performance.
   - Datasets that contain key names but fail to distinguish between the location of modifier keys (e.g., LShift vs. RShift) are marked as partial. Similarly, datasets missing either key press or release timestamps are also marked as partial.
   - Other features, such as audio/video recordings and physiological data (hand motion, ECG, EEG), provide opportunities to explore additional side channels.

4. **Attributes:**
   - Keylogging performance is influenced by environment variables related to the victim (age, gender, handedness) and the platform (keyboard model, timer resolution). Datasets containing labels for these attributes are marked accordingly. See [142] for a comprehensive review of environmental variables in keystroke acquisition.

5. **Impostor Data:**
   - Many datasets in Table IV were collected with keystroke biometrics in mind and include impostor data, which is a keystroke sequence recorded by a user purporting to be the genuine user.
