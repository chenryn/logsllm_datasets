B. Trafﬁc Collision Avoidance System
in the worst case, result
Although ATC manage airspace with high precision, air-
craft may end up closer than is safe. This loss of separation
can,
in a mid-air collision. One
example, mentioned above, occurred in March 2011 where a
Delta aircraft took off with an inactive transponder. This was
the ﬁrst in a line of errors which resulted in it becoming too
close to three other aircraft before resolving the issue [14]. If
active, Trafﬁc Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) provides
a technical means to avoid this, and has been mandated on
aircraft with more than 30 seats since 1993 [17], [25].
1) System Description: TCAS makes use of an aircraft’s
transponders to interrogate nearby aircraft [17]. Analyzing the
responses to these interrogations allows the object aircraft to
calculate whether those aircraft will become too close [18].
Based on lateral and vertical proximity to nearby aircraft,
visual representation and alerts are given to crew similar to
that in Fig. 2. These come in two steps; ﬁrst is a trafﬁc
advisory (TA), in which the trafﬁc is typically displayed to
the pilot as amber and an aural alert of ‘trafﬁc’ is given. If the
nearby aircraft becomes closer, a resolution advisory (RA) is
given. An RA will contain speciﬁc instructions for the ﬂight
crew, i.e., to climb or descend at a given rate, or hold vertical
speed. These instructions are decided between the two aircraft
automatically to deconﬂict the situation. RA instructions must
be followed within seconds.
In the cockpit, crew have control over the alerting level by
selecting Standby, TA-ONLY, or TA/RA. For most of a ﬂight,
TCAS will be set to TA/RA in which full alerting is provided.
TA-ONLY does not issue RAs, whereas Standby performs no
TCAS interrogations or conﬂict resolution [19].
2) Attack Description: In our scenario, the attacker aims
to cause crew responses to TCAS by triggering TAs and RAs
despite no aircraft being nearby. This is intended to burn
unnecessary fuel, break from air trafﬁc control clearances,

(b) Glideslope under attack with rogue antenna. Note how the aircraft touch-
down zone is now at the far end of the runway. This means that if the glideslope
is followed to touchdown, there may not be enough runway to slow down.

and centerline of the runway. A diagram of a GS can be seen
in Fig. 3a.
GSs and LOCs are monitored for accuracy to at least
10 nmi beyond the runway, as well as being protected from
interference to 25 nmi [42], [41]. It is important to note that
‘protection from interference’ here means avoiding systems
using nearby frequencies, rather than malicious interference.
Separately, approach lighting provides an out-of-band
check for crew on approach—Precision Approach Path Indi-
cators (PAPIs) are conﬁgured to match to the angle of the GS.
When an aircraft is on the correct GS, the PAPIs will show
two red and two white lights; otherwise more red or white
lights are shown as appropriate [22].
2) Attack Description: Here, the attacker is aiming to cause
unnecessary missed approaches as a result of a tampered GS,
similar to that in [40]. In turn, this will use additional fuel,
introduce delay and potentially force aircraft to divert to a
different airport. A secondary aim might be to force crew to
use a different, also attacked, approach method.
The attacker replicates the real GS but with the touchdown
zone short or long of the legitimate touchdown zone by
transmitting a replica signals from aside the runway. Since
they will not be able to station themselves on the runway,
they will operate outside the airﬁeld perimeter. This somewhat
matches the legitimate GS signal which is transmitted aside
the runway to avoid aircraft clipping the antennae.
Crucially the signals would be the same as a real GS, so
would not be identiﬁable by a high rate of descent, as common
GS issues can be. The difference induced by the attacker would
be subtle. For a typical 3° GS, moving the touchdown zone
1 km along the runway creates a consistent height difference
between the real and false GS of approximately 52 m, or 172 ft.
This could fall within a margin of error on approach, especially
whilst further away from the runway.
Such an attack is moderately difﬁcult due to creating the
correct signal and transmitting from an appropriate position.
We consider all of our threat actors capable of this but the
attack success may depend on the capability and equipment.
3) Expected Response: Since this attack will see the false

it
immediately obvious that
is incorrect. We expect most
participants to follow the GS until they are below cloud at
around 1000 ft, at which point they will notice a continued
slight discrepancy in AGL according to approach charts. They
may also notice such a discrepancy using the PAPIs, as they
will show four white lights. At this point, we expect them to
be between 500–1000 ft AGL and opt for a missed approach
and go-around.
4) Simulator Implementation: In the simulator, an attacker
transmits a false GS at the far end of the runway with an
effective shift of 2.05 km, or 1.27 miles, creating a difference
between the false and true GS of 107 m, or 352 ft. Due to the
way in which ILS is implemented in the simulator software, we
could not replicate also having a ‘real’ GS. To account for this,
we operated on an assumption that the attacker transmits at a
higher power than the real GS in an effort to force capture on
to the false GS. The manipulation remains in place regardless
of how many approaches are made. We treat the participant
aircraft as if it is the ﬁrst to encounter the attack, with ATC
not observing previous aircraft having difﬁculties.
V. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD
Since our attacks were speciﬁcally designed to examine
responses, we wanted to allow participants to react in real
time. To do this we used a ﬂight simulator, partially recreat-
ing a cockpit environment—in this section, we describe the
experimental setup used. The work was approved by our local
ethics committee with reference number R54139/001.
A. Participants
We recruited 30 pilots who had current Airbus A320 type-
rating or had held it in the past few years but had since moved
to larger Airbus aircraft. Our sample was recruited through
pilot forums, and open to pilots of any level of experience, First
Ofﬁcer or Captain. This is appropriate since pilots are trained
and kept current with a homogeneous skill set for a given
type of aircraft. Thus, all pilots are similarly skills-equipped
to handle the scenarios we presented to them. Participants were
compensated for their time with a gift voucher.

The interview assessed the pilot response to each attack,
focusing on perception of impact, trust, workload and safety.
This was done with closed questions, but we allowed the
participants to provide additional comments if they wished.
Only data from closed questions were used in our numerical
analysis. Interview questions are outlined in Sec. VI and pro-
vided in full in App. B. We recorded data from the simulator
to correlate with interview responses. This included control
inputs, aircraft position, speed and heading. The details of the
attacks were explained by the experimenter in debrief.
We note that our study has some limitations, discussed
further in Sec. VII. At this point we note two limitations.
First, whilst participants knew that they were taking part in
a study looking at cyber attacks on avionic systems, they did
not know about the timing or type of attack. Also, since the
interview was conducted by the experimenter, we acknowledge
that this may bias results to be more positive than if we
had conducted this anonymously. This is mostly relevant to
interview questions on the effectiveness of this approach as
training, and we note this where appropriate.
C. Equipment
Our hardware consisted of two high-end gaming PCs, run-
ning X-Plane 11 and an aftermarket Airbus A330 model as no
reliable A320 models were available, seen in Figure 4 [31]. We
checked the model ﬁdelity with type-rated Airbus A320 pilots
to ensure sufﬁcient similarity to an A320. We provided non-
type-speciﬁc hardware controls, since the majority of ﬂying on
such an airliner involves manipulating automatic ﬂight, rather
than directly ﬂying with manual controls. Participant opinions
on the equipment are presented in Sec. VII-E.
VI. RESULTS
We now discuss the data collected from simulator scenarios
and participant interviews. Interview response data can be seen
in Tab. I and Fig. 7, with full data for this ﬁgure provided in
App. C. Responses are on the following scales:
•
Q1. Conﬁdence in the response being the correct
one, on a scale from 1, very conﬁdent, to 5, very
unconﬁdent.

to provide data. Green bars

provided’.

1) Demographics: We collected demographics from partic-
ipants with an option not to provide information if desired. In
Fig. 5 we show participants by both role and whether they
hold a trainer role. We split into the three key crew roles
in order of increasing seniority: First Ofﬁcer, Senior First
Ofﬁcer and Captain. Furthermore, the colors indicate whether
the participant trains other pilots as part of their job.
In Fig. 6 we provide a chart of participant commercial ﬂy-
ing experience, grouped by role. Note that captains have a wide
range of years of ﬂying experience due to the requirements for
taking a captain role varying between company and location.
The median total years of commercial ﬂying experience for a
Captain was 19, for an SFO was 6 and for an FO was 4.5.
B. Protocol
For the purposes of control, we used the same weather
conditions, trafﬁc, and route for four runs. Pilots were asked
to ﬂy between two international airports, cruising at 12,000 ft,
for a total ﬂight time of around 30 minutes. Since the setup
was single-pilot, the experimenter provided support in enabling
modes, pressing buttons or selecting cockpit views for the
pilot. These actions were done solely at the command of
the pilot and the experimenter provided no decision support.
Additionally, the experimenter provided ATC information to
each pilot where relevant, such as approving clearances to
change altitude.
Each pilot was given the ﬁrst run as a familiarization ﬂight,
in which they could get used to the controls of the simulator.
The following three runs included some form of attack with
each followed by a short debrief interview. At the end of
the third attack and debrief, we asked some questions on the
study as a whole. We used the same order of attacks for each
participant.

Q3. Trust in systems affect due to the attack, on a
scale from 1, much more trust, to 5, much distrust.1
Q4. Impact on the ﬂight due to the attack, on a scale
from 1, signiﬁcant impact, to 4, no impact.
The Q2 and Q4 scales differed from scoring 1–5 to better
represent their topic. For Q2, we are measuring any increase
from baseline workload hence the scales are half of those in
Q1 and Q3. In Q4 we again measured from a baseline of no
impact but aimed to collect a more granular response coupled
with qualitative answers.
We also recorded yes/no responses for the following:
•
•
•
Q5. Whether they would trust systems under attack
later in ﬂight, N/A if they did not respond to the attack.
Q6. If participants felt the attack put the aircraft in a
less safe situation.
Q7. If participants would respond the same way in a
real aircraft (i.e. free of simulation restrictions).
Tab. I summarizes the response to these; note that the table
designates some responses to Q5 as not applicable in cases
where actions preclude the question. In the case of GPWS,
this is N/A is when the participant switches the system off,
for TCAS it is when they did not change the system mode
away from TA/RA and for GS it is when a participant landed
on the ﬁrst approach despite the attack.
A. GPWS Attack
First, we look at the GPWS scenario. We assess participants
primarily on their actions, i.e. go-around, land with the alarm
sounding or switch GPWS off and land, before considering
their scale responses.
Response: Participants generally responded as ex-
pected, split between those opting for a terrain avoidance
maneuver (thus a missed approach) and those disregarding the

cannot assess longer term trust as we did not carry out repeated simulations
for each attack, per participant.
