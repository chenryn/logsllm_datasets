User: What is the difference between Pods and Containers in Kubernetes?
Assistant: Pods and containers in Kubernetes are both objects used to manage applications, but their roles and management levels are slightly different. A Pod is the smallest deployable object in Kubernetes and usually consists of one or more closely related containers that share the same context and network namespace. Pods provide an abstraction layer that allows multiple related containers to share the same computing unit, and these containers usually need to work together to complete a certain task. Pods also manage the allocation of shared storage and resources. A container is an executable unit running in a Pod. A container is a lightweight, portable software container that contains application code, runtime environment, system tools, libraries, and configuration files. Containers provide an isolation mechanism that protects applications from other applications or the host machine and ensures that applications can run in a reliable and consistent manner. Containers are usually built from container images. Thus, a Pod is a logical abstraction for coordinating and managing related containers. A container is a physical entity used to run and maintain application code.
