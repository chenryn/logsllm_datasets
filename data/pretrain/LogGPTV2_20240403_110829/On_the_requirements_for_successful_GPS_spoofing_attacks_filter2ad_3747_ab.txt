of [13] use a setup based on two antennas to measure the phase
difference for each satellite to detect the lock takeover. [3] and [14]
analyze the spooﬁng effect on the carrier and code level. The au-
thors of [12] present a device that prevents spooﬁng by monitor-
ing and potentially suppressing the received signals before they are
processed by the GPS receiver.
All works above only consider attacks on single GPS receivers
but not on groups of receivers. In addition, none of them inves-
tigated the requirements for successful attacks on public GPS re-
ceivers, such as required precision of the attacker’s spooﬁng sig-
nals. Although we expect that more works on GPS spooﬁng and
anti-spooﬁng countermeasures were performed in classiﬁed (mili-
tary) settings, they are not accessible to the public.
3. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In order to give an intuition of the problem, we present our moti-
vation and an exemplary use case. Then, we deﬁne our system and
attacker models and formulate the GPS spooﬁng problem.
3.1 Motivation
The fundamental reasons why GPS spooﬁng works have been
discussed in the literature before, and spooﬁng attacks have been
demonstrated on single receivers experimentally. In this work, we
show under which conditions the attacker can establish the cor-
rect parameters to launch a successful spooﬁng attack on one or
more victims, and later in the experiments, how inaccuracies in
these parameters inﬂuence the lock takeover during the attack. This
analysis enables us to identify which attacks are theoretically pos-
sible and which attacks would be noticeable as (potentially non-
malicious) signal loss at the GPS receivers. This is important for
proposing effective receiver-based countermeasures, which are not
implemented yet in current standard GPS receivers.
Our work is further motivated by the real-life spooﬁng attacks,
e. g. the one reported in [24]. In this scenario, a cargo truck (the vic-
tim), had a GPS unit that was housed in a tamper-proof casing and
was sending cryptographically authenticated status updates with a
ﬁxed rate to a monitoring center. The attacker planned to steal the
truck to get access to its loaded goods at a remote place. He got
close to the victim and started transmitting forged (spoofed) sig-
nals in order to modify the location computed by the receiver (see
Figure 2). In this setting, if the attacker can inﬂuence the local-
ization process, he can make the victim report any position to the

monitoring center and thus steal the truck without raising suspicion
or revealing the truck’s real location.
3.2 System Model
Our system consists of a set of legitimate GPS satellites and a
set V of victims (see Table 1 for notations used). Each victim is
equipped with a GPS receiver that can compute the current position
and time as described in Section 2. We assume that each receiver
Vj ∈ V is able to receive wireless GPS signals, compute its po-
sition, and store its position/time-tuples. If several GPS receivers
belong to a common group (e. g., they are mounted on the same
vehicle), we assume that they can communicate to exchange their
computed locations or are aware of the group’s (ﬁxed) formation.
The GPS location of each individual victim Vj ∈ V is given by
its coordinates Lj ∈ R3 in space and the victim’s clock offset δj
with respect to the GPS system time tS. We note that the computed
GPS coordinates Lj and clock offset δj do not necessarily corre-
spond to the true (physical) coordinates Pj ∈ R3 and time.2 We
deﬁne the local time of Vj as tj = tS + δj, i. e., δj < 0 refers to
an internal clock that lags behind. We use L to denote the set of
GPS locations of the victims in V. A GPS spooﬁng attack may ma-
nipulate a receiver’s coordinates in space and/or its local time. We
j ∈ R3 and the spoofed
denote a victim’s spoofed coordinates by L(cid:48)
j. We use L(cid:48) for the set of spoofed victim locations.
time offset by δ(cid:48)
In our analysis in Section 4, we distinguish between civilian
GPS, which uses the public C/A codes so that each satellite sig-
nal si contains only public information, and military GPS, which
provides authentic, conﬁdential signals using the secret P(Y) codes.
In the experimental evaluation in Section 5, we use a satellite signal
generator for civilian GPS.
3.3 Attacker Model
GPS signals can be trivially spoofed under a Dolev-Yao [4]-like
attacker that is able to fully control the wireless trafﬁc by inter-
cepting, injecting, modifying, replaying, delaying, and blocking
messages without temporal constraints for individual receivers, see
Figure 3(b). If the attacker has full control over the input to each
individual receiver antenna, he can send the signals as they would
be received at any location L(cid:48)
j. This would, however, require the
attacker to either be very close to each receiver or to use directional
antennas with narrow beam widths and shielding to prevent that the
signals intended for one victim are also received by another victim;
in both cases, the number of required attacker antennas would be
linear in the number of victims. In this work we assume that the
signals sent by the attacker are transmitted wirelessly and that they
will be received by all victims in V, see Figure 3(a).
The attacker controls a set of wireless transmitters that he can

77Deﬁnition 1 (GPS Spooﬁng Attack). Let a victim V compute its
GPS location as L and its GPS time as t in the absence of an at-
tacker. In a GPS spooﬁng attack, the attacker sends spooﬁng sig-
nals to manipulate the victim’s GPS-based location calculations.
(cid:54)= L and/or time as
As a result, V computes its location as L(cid:48)
t(cid:48) (cid:54)= t.
Deﬁnition 1 can also be extended to groups of victims:
Deﬁnition 2 (GPS Group Spooﬁng Problem). Let L(cid:48) be a set of
target locations for each Vj ∈ V and let t(cid:48)
j ∈ T (cid:48) denote the tar-
get time for Vj. The GPS Group Spooﬁng Problem is the problem
of ﬁnding combinations of GPS signals sA
(sent by the attacker),
i
transmission times tA
(when the spooﬁng signals are
sent), and physical transmission locations P A
(from where the at-
tacker transmits) such that the location or time of each Vj ∈ V is
i
spoofed according to Deﬁnition 1.
i = tS + δA
i
We note that the physical attacker locations P A
i do not have to
correspond to the claimed satellite positions LA
in the GPS mes-
i
sages (for civilian GPS, LA
i can even be chosen by the attacker).
As we will show in Section 4.2, the GPS spooﬁng problem for a
single victim has a trivial solution for any target location.
In Section 4.3, we will analyze the necessary restrictions on the
spoofed locations such that the GPS Group Spooﬁng Problem can
be solved. We therefore deﬁne a decisional version of the GPS
Group Spooﬁng Problem.
Deﬁnition 3 (Decisional GPS Group Spooﬁng Problem). Let P be
the set of physical locations of the victims in V. Let L(cid:48) and T (cid:48)
be deﬁned according to Deﬁnition 2. The Decisional GPS Group
Spooﬁng Problem for P,L(cid:48),T (cid:48) is the decision problem whether
there exists at least one set of attacker locations P A from where
the attacker can send the spooﬁng signals sA
i such that the location
or time of each victim Vj ∈ V is spoofed according to Deﬁnition 1.
In practice, the GPS Group Spooﬁng Problems (Deﬁnitions 2
and 3) may be restricted in terms of attacker capabilities. For ex-
ample, the attacker may only be able to position his transmission
antennas at a restricted set of physical locations P A∗ , at a restricted
set of claimed satellite positions LA∗ , or he may only be able to
send the spooﬁng signals at a restricted set of transmission times
T A∗ (e. g., if he must receive legitimate signals before he can send
the spooﬁng signals).
In these cases, the GPS Group Spooﬁng
Problems can be modiﬁed to take the restricted attacker capabili-
ties LA∗ , P A∗ , T A∗ as additional input and ﬁnd solutions that fulﬁll
P A ⊂ P A∗ , LA ⊂ LA∗ , or T A ⊂ T A∗ .
4. SOLVING GPS SPOOFING PROBLEMS
We now analyze how our attacker (as deﬁned in Section 3.3) can
spoof the locations of one or more receivers. In this section, we
abstract away from implementation issues (such as taking over an
established lock to legitimate satellites, see Section 5) and assume
that there are no legitimate signals present on the channel. The
intuition underlying the results that we will present is the following:
spooﬁng requires the attacker to send out signals precisely aligned
in time. This will be harder—if not impossible—for increasing
numbers of victims (as summarized in Table 2 and visualized in
Figure 5).

physical location of the i-th transmission unit of the attacker (ma-
nipulating the signals of satellite Si), and the set of all physical
attacker locations from where the attacker is transmitting by P A.
We assume that the attacker’s inherent, unwanted clock offset to the
GPS system time is negligible3 and use δA
to capture the time shift

introduced by the attacker in the transmission of signal sA
i with
respect to the signal si and the system time tS. For example, for
1 = 10 ms, the attacker transmits the spoofed signal 10 ms after
δA
the signal s1 was transmitted by satellite S1.
For our analysis, we assume that the attacker is aware of the
victims’ physical locations (the inﬂuence of errors in the attackers
location estimates is evaluated in Section 5). We further denote by
i − Pj| the physical distance between satellite Si and victim
|LS
i − Pj| denotes the physical distance between
Vj. Similarly, |P A
the attacker’s antenna at P A
i and victim Vj. Given this setting, we
distinguish the following two types of attacks:
Attacks on civilian (unauthenticated) GPS: The attacker can de-
i ∈ R. He can
lay signals or send them prematurely, i. e., δA
modify the content of received GPS signals or arbitrarily gen-
erate the spooﬁng signals sA
i using the public GPS parame-
ters (e. g., by using a GPS signal generator). This is possible
because civilian GPS signals are not authenticated—given
the right hardware, anyone can transmit his own GPS sig-
nals. Thus the attacker can also modify the claimed locations
i . We note that on standard GPS
of the satellites: LA
i
receivers, the data content in the received GPS signals is not
checked for plausibility or consistency [15].
(cid:54)= LS
Attacks on military (authenticated) GPS: The attacker is not able
to generate valid military GPS signals. All he can do is to
capture and relay existing signals, e. g. by separating signals
from different satellites using high-gain directional antennas
and broadband transceivers (called Selective-Delay in [11]).
This means that the attacker can delay existing GPS signals
i ≥
and amplify or attenuate them. He is restricted by δA
|LS
i |/c, i. e., signals can be delayed but not sent prior
to their reception. We note that neither the spreading codes
nor the data content of the signal need to be known to the
attacker for a successful selective-delay attack.
i − P A
We note that these attacker models are very strong. Nevertheless,
we consider them appropriate for our analysis because we want to
make general statements that hold even under very strong (worst-
case) attackers with sophisticated equipment.
3.4 Formulation of GPS Spooﬁng Problems
We ﬁrst deﬁne GPS spooﬁng attacks and then present two GPS
spooﬁng problems for the attacker.
3The attacker can synchronize his time to legitimate GPS signals.
