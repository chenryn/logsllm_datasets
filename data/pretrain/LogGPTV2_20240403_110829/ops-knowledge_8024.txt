User: I've been using Python for a long time and have numerous scripts running all over my office. I use a few in particular scripts to back up then delete data. In these script I use os.remove function.
My question is: Where does the os.remove function delete items to?

Does it delete them right off the HD?
I know they don't go to the recycle bin
Does it simply remove the item's link, but keep it on the HD somehow?
Assistant: it just deletes them from the harddrive
