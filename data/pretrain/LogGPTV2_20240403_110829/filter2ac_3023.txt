**ATT&CK ID:** G0094  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Kimsuky

Kimsuky has been observed using PowerShell to check for the presence of antivirus software. Specifically, they use the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet with the following parameters: `-Namespace root\SecurityCenter2` and `-ClassName AntivirusProduct`.[55]

This method allows the threat actor to gather information about installed antivirus products, which can be used to tailor their attack strategies and avoid detection.
