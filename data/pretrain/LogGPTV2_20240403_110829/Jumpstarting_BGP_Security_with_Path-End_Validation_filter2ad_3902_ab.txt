To address the concerns of ISPs regarding the disclosure of their neighbors' (specifically, customers') identities to competitors, our design incorporates a "privacy-preserving mode." In this mode, an ISP can deploy path-end filters without registering its neighbors in the database. This approach protects privacy-conscious ISPs from becoming victims of next-AS attacks, while also enhancing security for other ASes.

However, it is important to note the following points:
1. Over 85% of ASes are not ISPs. A significant portion of Internet traffic originates from and is destined for ASes that do not have customers, such as Google, Netflix, and others. These large content providers benefit from path-end validation, as we will discuss in Section 4.
2. While some non-ISPs may wish to keep the identities of their neighbors private, the majority do not have a business interest in maintaining this secrecy. For example, PeeringDB [43] openly shares such information.
3. Even if an ISP does not reveal the identity of a customer, that customer can choose to disclose its connection to the ISP for its own protection.
4. Validating the last hop of an AS path provides substantial security benefits, allowing non-ISPs to achieve high levels of protection even without full ISP cooperation.
5. Information about an AS's neighbors can often be inferred from publicly available BGP advertisements, limiting the practical privacy benefits of withholding this information.

### 3. Prerequisites

As demonstrated in [33], BGPsec offers limited security benefits in partial deployment and fails to meet two essential prerequisites for any inter-domain routing security mechanism:
1. **Stability**: The mechanism should never destabilize the routing system.
2. **Security Monotonicity**: An attacker's ability to attract traffic should never improve as more ASes adopt the security mechanism.

We prove below that path-end validation satisfies these requirements in any deployment scenario. Additionally, we show in Section 4 that path-end validation significantly outperforms BGPsec in terms of security benefits under partial adoption.

#### 3.1 Model

We provide a brief overview of the standard model for reasoning about BGP dynamics, the Gao-Rexford model [17], and then present the threat model and the path-end validation deployment model. We then present our results for stability and security monotonicity within these models.

**Network Model:**
- The network is modeled as an undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \), where vertices represent ASes labeled by their AS numbers, and edges represent communication links between them.
- Each link in \( E \) is annotated with one of two business relationships: customer-provider (directed from customer to provider) or peer-to-peer (no-cost mutual transit).

**Gao-Rexford Conditions:**
- **Topology Condition**: No customer-provider cycles exist in the AS-level graph.
- **Preference Condition**: Prefer customer-learned routes over peer- and provider-learned routes.
- **Export Condition**: Only export provider and peer-learned routes to customers.

These conditions ensure the convergence of the BGP system to a stable routing configuration [17].

**Threat Model:**
- Attackers are modeled as a set \( \text{Adv} \subset V \). An attacker must advertise a single, fixed route to a prefix \( \pi \) to each of its neighbors but can announce different routes to different neighbors.
- An attacker cannot lie about its AS number, so each announced route must begin with the attacker's AS number. The attacker can, however, perform prefix/subprefix hijacking, next-AS attacks, or 2-hop attacks.

**Path-End Validation in Partial Adoption:**
- To model a BGP system with partial (or full) adoption of path-end validation, we include a set \( \text{Adpt} \subseteq V \) of vertices that perform path-end filtering.
- Path-end validation, deployed on top of RPKI, protects adopters from both prefix and subprefix hijacking (via RPKI) and next-AS attacks (via path-end validation).
- If a vertex \( d \in V \) registers a path-end record, any vertex \( v \in \text{Adpt} \) discards routes to \( \pi \) that do not end with \( d - \pi \) or \( n - d - \pi \), where \( \pi \) is owned by \( d \) and \( n \) is an authorized neighbor of \( d \).

#### 3.2 Stability

Lychev et al. [32] showed that, under the Gao-Rexford conditions, BGP converges to a stable state even in the presence of fixed-route attackers. Therefore, misconfigurations/attacks like prefix hijacks and next-AS attacks do not destabilize BGP routing. We demonstrate that this holds true for any deployment scenario of path-end validation, contrasting it with the risk of routing instabilities from inconsistent BGPsec route selection [33].

**Theorem 1:**
Under the Gao-Rexford conditions, a BGP system with any set of vertices \( \text{Adpt} \) adopting path-end validation is guaranteed to converge to a stable routing configuration, even in the presence of any set \( \text{Adv} \) of fixed-route attackers.

#### 3.3 Security-Monotonicity

An inter-domain routing security mechanism is security-monotone if an attacker's ability to attract traffic to its network is never enhanced as more ASes adopt the mechanism. We show that this holds for path-end validation.

**Theorem 2:**
Under the Gao-Rexford conditions, for any BGP system, attacker AS \( a \), and victim AS \( v \), if traffic from some source-AS \( x \) destined for \( v \) does not reach \( a \) when the set of adopters is \( \text{Adpt} \subseteq V \), then this also holds for any set of adopters that is a super-set of \( \text{Adpt} \).

### 4. Path-End Validation vs. BGPsec

In this section, we assume global adoption of RPKI and compare the security provided by path-end validation and BGPsec in partial deployment. We show that even with limited adoption, path-end validation provides security benefits close to those of BGPsec in full deployment, whereas BGPsec offers minimal benefits in partial deployment [33]. We also evaluate the performance of path-end validation when RPKI is only partially deployed.

#### 4.1 Methodology

**Simulation Framework:**
- We evaluate different attack strategies and quantify the attacker's success by the fraction of ASes attracted, similar to [18, 33].
- Our simulations use the BGP route-computation framework from [18, 19, 23] applied to the empirically-derived CAIDA AS-level graph [8] from January 2016, which includes inferred bilateral business relationships and previously hidden peering links within IXPs [20].

**Routing Policy:**
1. Local preferences: Prefer routes with a customer next-hop over peer and provider next-hops.
2. AS-path length: Prefer shorter routes.
3. Tie break: Break ties based on the next-hop AS number.
4. Export: Advertise routes learned from a customer AS to all neighbors; otherwise, export to customers only.

**Path-End Validation:**
- When an AS adopts path-end validation, it adds a route-filtering step before the above policy steps. If a BGP advertisement is incompatible with the path-end records in RPKI, it is discarded.

**Max-k-Security Problem:**
- Identifying the best set of adopters of a given size \( k > 0 \) is computationally hard. We consider the "Max-k-Security" problem adapted from [33]: Given an AS graph, a specific attacker-victim pair \( (a, v) \), and a parameter \( k > 0 \), find a set \( S \) of size \( k \) of path-end validation adopters that minimizes the total number of ASes whose paths reach the attacker. This problem is NP-hard.

**Heuristics for Good Adopters:**
- Our experiments evaluate the security benefits from the adoption of path-end validation by the top ISPs, i.e., ASes with the largest numbers of AS customers. Results show significant security benefits even with very few large ISPs adopting.

#### 4.2 Security Evaluation

**Figure 2:**
- The x-axis represents 11 deployment scenarios corresponding to adoption of path-end validation by the set of 0, 10, ..., 100 largest ISPs.
- The y-axis shows the average fraction of ASes on the Internet whose traffic the attacker can attract to his network.
- Two dashed reference lines: (1) the attacker's success rate with fully deployed RPKI and (2) the attacker's success rate with fully deployed BGPsec, including protocol downgrade attacks.

**Figure 2a:**
- Compares the Internet-wide security benefits of different mechanisms for uniformly-selected attacker-victim pairs.
- Path-end validation is highly effective at thwarting next-AS attacks, even with only 20 adopters. With 100 adopters, the next-AS attack vector is almost completely blocked, while BGPsec shows minimal improvement over RPKI.

**Figure 2b:**
- Describes the protection that path-end validation provides to large content providers (e.g., Google, Amazon, Netflix).
- Evaluates the protection for each victim content provider, showing significant security benefits.

**Figure 3:**
- Shows the attacker's success rate for different classes of victims and attackers, such as large ISPs and stubs.
- Path-end validation consistently outperforms BGPsec in partial deployment, providing robust security even with limited adoption.
