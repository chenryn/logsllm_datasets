title:blackhat:eu-22 DnD: Decompiling Deep Neural Network Compiled Binary
The usage of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has steadily increased in recent years. Especially when used in edge devices and embedded systems, dedicated DNN compilers are used to compile DNNs into binaries for the best performance. Security applications such as DNN model extraction, white-box adversarial sample generation, and DNN model patching become possible when a DNN model is accessible. However, these techniques cannot be applied to compiled DNN binaries. No decompilers can recover a high-level representation of a DNN model from its compiled binary code.In this paper, we introduce DnD, the first ISA- and compiler-agnostic DNN decompiler. DnD uses the customized symbolic execution to lift the DNN binary into symbolic expressions represented in a novel intermediate representation (IR), which abstracts the high-level mathematical DNN operations in an ISA- and compiler-agnostic fashion. Then, DnD matches the lifted mathematical DNN operations with reference mathematical DNN operations and recovers hyper-parameters and parameters of all the identified DNN operators, as well as the overall DNN topology. We evaluate DnD on different DNN binaries compiled by two different compilers (Glow and TVM) and for three different ISAs (Thumb, AArch64, and x86-64) and show that DnD can perfectly recover their model information. Moreover, using DND, we successfully reverse engineer the DNN models from the binary deployed on real-world micro-controllers and attack them with the white-box adversarial machine learning techniques.
