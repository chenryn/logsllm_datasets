## Past Throughput Analysis
Using the data collected from UEs connected to the North panel, we trained a T+M model. This model was then used to test features associated with the South panel, achieving a decent weighted average F1-score (w-avgF1) of 0.71. When the UE-Panel distance is less than 25 meters, the w-avgF1 further increases to 0.91, indicating high environmental similarity between the North and South panels within this range.

## Feature Importance Analysis
We utilized GDBT's capability to report global feature importance to understand each feature's contribution to the final prediction outcome. No single feature or feature group dominates in predicting 5G throughput. A more detailed analysis of global feature importance is provided in Appendix A.2, supporting our argument that various factors and their complex interplay collectively affect 5G throughput.

## Comparison with Existing Models
We compared the performance of our ML models in Lumos5G with several baseline models proposed in the literature for 3G/4G performance prediction:
1. **Classic ML**: Random Forest (RF) [20], KNN
2. **Analytical**: Ordinary Kriging (OK) [26], Harmonic Mean (HM) [38, 64]

While HM is used for short-term predictions, others have been used in both short and long-term contexts. For classification-based models, we used weighted average F1-score (w-avgF1), while MAE and RMSE were used for regression. Table 9 summarizes the results, showing the superiority of GDBT and Seq2Seq models over the baselines across all feature groups. Our regression models achieved a 27% to 79% reduction in MAE, and classification models showed a 9% to 37% improvement in w-avgF1. History-based models like HM, which use immediate past throughput observations, suffer due to frequent fluctuations in mmWave 5G throughput. The superiority of Lumos5G stems from judicious feature selection and the expressiveness of the ML models, such as the "deep" nature of the Seq2Seq model (ยง5.2). Results for other areas are in Appendix A.3.

## Related Work
Various ML-based or analytical models have been proposed for 3G/4G cellular networks. For example, Margolies et al. [43] incorporate UE mobility prediction in channel state estimation for 3G resource scheduling. Schulman et al. [56] consider UE signal strength measurement for energy-aware scheduling. Chakraborty et al. [26] use OK-based geospatial interpolation, and Alimpertis et al. [20] use RF models for LTE signal strength prediction. An LSTM-based deep learning model is proposed in [45] for 3G/4G throughput prediction. These studies highlight that location alone is insufficient for 3G/4G prediction; other factors must be considered. In mmWave 5G, spatial correlations are weaker, making geospatial interpolation less effective. Our work demonstrates that existing ML models do not perform as well as our methods, as shown in Appendix A.4.

## Discussion
### Limitations
Our study primarily relies on key UE-side factors and exogenous information. We do not heavily utilize PHY-layer features due to limited access and unreliable data. The study is limited to one smartphone model, and we cannot account for uncontrollable factors like radio resource contention and network congestion. Future work includes studying the impact of device models, transferability of ML models, temporal generalizability, and sensitivity to input inaccuracies.

### Need for Collaborative Efforts
Lumos5G is designed to predict 5G throughput, aiding applications using 5G services. Many required features may not be available to developers, raising questions about model building. Mobile carriers, who already collect UE-side data, are plausible candidates. Carriers also track user movement for beamforming and manage network resources. A user-carrier collaborative, crowdsourced platform is the most promising avenue to realize 5G throughput mapping, benefiting all stakeholders.

### Building 5G-Aware Apps
Our study highlights opportunities and challenges in building 5G-aware apps. High bandwidth variability calls for new mechanisms. Preliminary studies show that existing adaptive bitrate adaptation (ABR) algorithms do not work well for ultra-HD video streaming over 5G. Using Lumos5G, we propose new rate adaptation algorithms with layered video coding, content bursting, and multi-radio switching mechanisms. Fully exploring these issues warrants further research.

## Concluding Remarks
We conducted a first-of-its-kind study on the predictability of mmWave 5G throughput. Despite its fast attenuation and sensitivity to environment and mobility, it is feasible to predict 5G throughput with reasonable accuracy based on UE-side factors.
