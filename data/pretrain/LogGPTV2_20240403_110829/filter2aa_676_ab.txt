The Commission seeks comment on the appropriate level of sensitivity a device 
must have when determining the presence of other signals (i.e., the “detection 
threshold”).8  The correct detection threshold must protect existing licensed uses, while at 
the same time not being so restrictive as to limit the usefulness of the unlicensed devices 
operating in the white spaces.  As the Further Notice explains, “a lower detection 
threshold infers greater interference protection for services operating in the TV spectrum,

but could also result in increased false positives as a response to spurious radio noise … 
sharply reducing the usefulness of this spectrum for TV band devices.”9   
In determining an appropriate detection threshold, the Coalition recommends that 
the Commission use Threshold of Visibility (“TOV”) as the measurable and verifiable 
proxy for TV channel vacancy at the Grade B Contour.  TOV is the received signal level 
at the input terminals of the TV receiver below which the DTV receiver cannot reproduce 
the transmitted picture.  Accordingly, it is reasonable to conclude that a channel is vacant 
at a particular time and geographic location when the signal falls below TOV.  
The Commission already has determined that existing DTV receivers are able to 
provide service until the signal level at the input terminal to the receiver falls below 
approximately –84 dBm (TOV) for UHF signals, and slightly higher for VHF.10  
However, because the relative position of the TV transmitter, the TV receiver antenna, 
and the unlicensed device are unknown, a lower detection threshold is required for the 
unlicensed device to determine if a TV channel is vacant.  The Coalition proposes that the 
detection threshold of the unlicensed device be set by the Commission at 30 dB below the 
Commission’s established threshold of visibility, or -114 dBm.  As set forth below, 
because the Coalition’s prototype device is designed to detect analog as well as digital 
signals, the -114 dBm detection threshold also will provide the protection necessary for 
licensed wireless microphones and other incumbent analog operations.

10  DTV receivers currently on the market are able to provide service at TOV at the following signal 
levels:  -82.2 dBm (low VHF), -83.2 dBm (high VHF), and – 83.9 dBm (UHF).  See Stephen R. 
Martin, Tests of ATSC 8-VSB Reception Performance of Consumer Digital Television Receivers 
Available in 2005, FCC/OET TR 05-1017 at 8-4 (Nov. 2, 2005).

While the Commission has expressed some concern that a spectrum sensing 
approach could be subject to a “hidden node” problem,11 the -114 dBm detection 
threshold proposed by the Coalition provides sufficient margin to resolve this potential 
issue.  A “hidden node” problem can occur when an obstacle such as a building sits 
between a licensee’s signal and the device performing signal detection.  Citing this 
phenomenon, broadcasters erroneously contend that the unlicensed device would be 
unable to protect an otherwise usable TV signal and may begin transmitting, thus causing 
harmful interference (e.g., a nearby TV receiver is connected to an antenna on a roof that 
is placed above the obstruction blocking the signal to the unlicensed device).   However, 
there are several reasons why the risk of a hidden node problem is for practical purposes 
eliminated in the TV band context using the detection threshold proposed by the 
Coalition.   
As the Commission has observed, the TV bands have superior propagation 
characteristics, 12 which substantially reduce the likelihood that an incumbent licensee’s 
signals will be blocked.  Moreover, unlike a TV receiver, an unlicensed sensor does not 
have to demodulate and reproduce a picture to perform its function.  It only has to 
confirm the presence of a signal—a task that can be accomplished for signals 
substantially weaker than those required to reproduce a transmitted picture.  Indeed, as 
the Commission explained in the Cognitive Radio NPRM, “[t]he use of a feature detector 
much more sensitive than the TV receiver … makes [a hidden node problem] much less 
11  See FNPRM ¶ 39 (noting that hidden nodes are a “potential problem” for spectrum sensing and 
requesting views on the scope of the problem).     
12  See id. ¶ 1 (noting that “transmissions in the TV band are subject to less propagation attenuation than 
transmissions in other bands where lower power operations are permitted”).

likely.”13  Furthermore, transmit power control (“TPC”) capabilities for TV band 
unlicensed devices (discussed below) would further reduce the likelihood of harmful 
interference to incumbent licensees in the TV bands.14   
As the following examples illustrate, the proposed -114 dBm detection threshold 
is more than sufficient to protect broadcast services from harmful interference: 
Example 1 - A DTV signal with a 6 dB gain outdoor TV antenna is -90 dBm and 
the cable from the antenna to the TV is lossless. The signal at the input of the receiver 
will be at TOV or -84 dBm (+6 dB - 90 dBm).  Assuming that the building DTV signal 
attenuation at the unlicensed device is 15 dB, and the unlicensed device employs a 0 dB 
(unity gain) omnidirectional antenna, the received signal at the unlicensed device will be 
-105 dBm (-90 dBm - 15dB).  So if the detection threshold for the unlicensed device is 
set at -114 dBm, the device will conclude that the channel is occupied with 9 dB of 
margin to spare.  
Example 2 - A TV is attached to a 0 dB (unity gain) indoor antenna instead of an 
outdoor antenna.  The TV will then receive a signal of -105 dBm (-90 dBm - 15dB) 
producing no visible picture.  Since the unlicensed device will still receive a signal of  
-105 dBm, it will conclude that the channel is occupied and not transmit on it (even 
though it would cause no harmful interference even if it did transmit).

Though these two simple examples do not represent all possible situations, they do 
provide confidence that a -114 dBm detection threshold provides more than adequate 
protection.  Coalition empirical testing, hopefully to be verified by Commission testing, 
eliminates any doubt that -114 dBm is more than sufficient to protect all incumbent 
license holders. 
In short, spectrum sensing provides a reliable means of determining whether a 
particular channel is available for use by an unlicensed device.  The Coalition fully 
endorses its use and urges the Commisson to do the same. 
B. 
The Geolocation/Database and Control Signal Approaches are 
Neither Practicable nor Desirable. 
The Commission also seeks additional comment on the geo-location/database and 
control signal approaches discussed in the initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in this 
proceeding.15  Even assuming that these approaches are feasible, however, the 
Commission should not make either approach mandatory for personal/portable devices.  
Most importantly, each of these solutions requires the creation and maintenance of 
centralized infrastructure to utilize the white spaces, which would eliminate the ability to 
create organic, decentralized networks.  Thus, mandating either of these approaches 
would deprive the white spaces of the flexibility that has characterized the success of the 
2.4 GHz band.  Concerns raised by the Commission in the Further Notice with respect to 
these mechanisms further underscore why a pure spectrum sensing approach provides a 
superior alternative for preventing harmful interference to incumbent licensees.   
15  Id. ¶¶ 49-55.

First, as the Commission has observed, a complete database of TV stations must 
be created and updated in real-time.16  The Commission notes that it could rely on a 
private party to maintain such a database,17 but this approach would add unnecessary 
costs, such as administrative fees for access to the database.  An approach dependent on 
third party infrastructure deployments could also create a disastrous Catch-22:  database 
and/or control signal providers may not offer services unless they believe that the number 
of unlicensed devices would make it profitable to do so, while manufacturers and service 
providers may not invest resources unless they are certain a viable database/control signal 
is available.  It is therefore easy to conceive of a situation where no one moves forward 
and, in spite of the Commission’s efforts, the TV white spaces remain unused.         
Moreover, even assuming the existence of a database provider, this approach 
raises other operational concerns.18  With respect to the geo-location approach, the 
requirement that a base station communicate with an unlicensed device will require a 
service provider to lease space to situate the base station.  Such a requirement will delay, 
if not effectively prohibit, deployment and add substantial additional costs.  Professional 
installation would add even more costs, and would be inapplicable to personal/portable 
devices.  
While unlicensed outdoor devices could employ GPS technology in lieu of 
professional installation, indoor GPS receivers often are unable to communicate with

18  See id. ¶ 51 (“If a device is professionally installed, who should be permitted to install it?  What is the 
appropriate method of determining the required separation from authorized users in the TV bands?  
How will the geo-location/database approach protect other authorized services, such as wireless 
microphones, the location of which may not be included in the databases?”).   
11
GPS satellites.  The Commission has asked about the possibility of implementing 
Assisted GPS (“AGPS”) to make position fixes more likely in areas where GPS signals 
are weak,19 but AGPS requires access to a reference network—such as the cellular 
networks deployed by CMRS providers—to “assist” the GPS receiver by transmitting 
data that helps the device determine its location.  To the Coalition’s knowledge, no 
CMRS provider has made access to their networks commercially available for this 
purpose.  Even assuming that such access could be obtained, it would add yet another 
unnecessary cost for devices, further decreasing the likelihood of economic viability.  
Addressing the above issues might make a geo-location/database approach a 
technologically viable mechanism for interference avoidance, but at best it would remain 
more cumbersome and significantly more costly than a spectrum sensing approach, with 
no offsetting benefit.   
A solution based on control signals presents even greater implementation 
concerns.20  As with geo-location, sending a control signal to a device containing a listing 
of vacant TV channels in the signal’s service area would require the creation and 
maintenance of a real-time TV database, with the resulting unnecessary costs.  A number 
of parties also have raised concerns about such an approach even in areas where control 
signals would be available, including conflict of interest problems associated with 
19  Id. ¶ 51 n. 64. 
20  While the NPRM initially proposed a control signal requirement for personal/portable unlicensed 
devices, the FNPRM recognized the possibility that “one interference avoidance scheme could be used 
effectively for both types of TV band devices.”  FNPRM ¶ 25.  For the reasons set forth below, the 
Coalition strongly opposes a mandatory control signal requirement, and urges the Commission to make 
clear that it will not impose such a requirement on personal/portable devices.

allowing broadcasters to operate and/or charge for access to control signal information,21 
as well as the potential for devices to receive conflicting signals from multiple sources.22

Other Operating Parameters.       
1. 
Transmit power control. 
The Commission proposes to employ transmit power control (“TPC”) limits for 
unlicensed devices operating in the TV band.23  The Coalition supports TPC 
requirements, which “further reduce the potential for interference”24 and provide an even 
greater degree of confidence that a spectrum sensing approach will protect incumbent 
users.  Consistent with the requirements for U-NII devices in the 5 GHz band, the 
Commission proposes to require a TPC dynamic range of 6 dB, and asks whether a 
greater dynamic range of power limits might be appropriate as long as that power level is 
still sufficient to communicate.25  The Coalition suggests a minimum TPC dynamic range 
of 20 dB, which will provide 14 dB more protection than was proposed by the 
Commission.26  Moreover, this recommendation is in addition to the 6 dB reduction from 
the original operating parameters proposed in the NPRM that will be realized by using 
antennas with a maximum of 0 dBi (unity gain).  Coalition members plan to design 
devices that, while capable of transmitting at a maximum power of 100 mW EIRP, will

employ TPC whenever possible to ensure that the minimum power required for reliable 
transmission between the transmitter and the receivers within range is used.        
2. 
Other technical considerations.  
The Commission also seeks comment on a number of specific proposals regarding 
technical rules necessary to implement a spectrum sensing approach.27  The Coalition 
agrees that the majority of these proposals will help ensure the successful implementation 
of spectrum sensing for unlicensed devices operating in the TV band.28   
Channel availability check time, move time, and non-occupancy period - The 
Coalition agrees with the Commission that unlicensed devices should establish that a TV 
channel is vacant at a particular time and geographic location before transmitting.  The 
Commission asks whether there is a need to provide a specific period of time over which 
initial sensing must occur.29  It should not.  There is no need to specify a standard sensing 
interval for all devices, as the optimum check time for each device will be dictated by 
algorithms implemented by each manufacturer to meet the minimum threshold of 
detection requirements that the Commission ultimately requires.  The Commission should 
specify only the required threshold of detection, and the time to sense that level should be 
left to the manufacturer, provided the prerequisite sensitivity is achieved before a signal 
is transmitted.  
27  Id. ¶¶ 40-48.  
28  Id. ¶ 34 (“Based on our experience in developing the spectrum sensing rules for 5 GHZ U-NII devices, 
we do, however, believe that the DFS approach in those rules can, with appropriate modifications, be 
applied to TV band devices.”).   
29  Id. ¶ 41. 
14
The Coalition also believes that a requirement to re-check a particular channel in 
use by an unlicensed device operating in the TV bands would not be unreasonable,30 
though a requirement to re-check every 10 seconds is wholly unnecessary and would 
reduce the throughput of unlicensed devices with no appreciable increase in protection 
for broadcasters.  Rather, in light of the “always on” nature of incumbent licensees, a re-
check requirement on the order of one minute is more appropriate.  With respect to move 
time after a station’s presence is detected, however, the Coalition believes that the period 
of 10 seconds proposed by the Commission in the First Report and Order is sufficient.31   
Finally, the Coalition agrees with the Commission that it is unnecessary to 
establish a fixed period during which an unlicensed device operating in the TV bands 
must stay off the air in a particular channel after the device determines that the channel is 
occupied.32  As the Commission has observed, incumbent licensees will receive adequate
