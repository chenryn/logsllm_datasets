Define service level: clarify service quality standards and indicators, such as availability, response time, fault handling time, etc. 2. Agree on service details: specify the specific content, scope, limitations and service time of the service. 3. Determine the responsibilities of both parties: stipulate the respective responsibilities and obligations of the service provider and the service receiver, including risk assumption, backup and recovery, etc. 4. Constrained service conditions: specify the requirements and restrictions on communication, communication, feedback and supervision between the service provider and the service receiver. 5. Determining punitive measures: specifying punitive measures and breach of contract responsibilities for non-compliance in service performance, as well as compensation measures for service providers, etc. 6. Update and check SLA: Provide SLA update and check mechanism, timely feedback and solve problems. 7. Write the terms: Define the terms and checklist of the SLA, write concise and clear language, and indicate the date of signing and effective time.
