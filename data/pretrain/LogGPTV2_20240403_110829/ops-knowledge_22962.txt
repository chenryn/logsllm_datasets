User: I trying to run a hello world app on my device environment using ga and Python, however even not doing any explicit url request, the urllib2 is having some problems with my proxy server. 
I tried adding the localhost to the list of exclusion and it didn't work. If I disable the proxy on machine it works perfectly. 
How can I make it work without disabling the proxy  for all programs?
Assistant: If you are running your app from the terminal, using dev_appserver.py try using the --skip_sdk_update_check switch, it may be the SDK update check that is failing.
