## The Myth of the Yale Goal-Setting Study

- **Introduction**: We wanted to start with an inspiring story, often cited in the context of goal setting.
- **Yale Study**: 
  - **Claim**: 3% of students who wrote down their goals achieved more than the other 97% combined.
  - **Reality**: This study is not real, despite its widespread citation.
  - **Insight**: Brian Tracy, a renowned motivational speaker, once said, "I heard this story originally from Zig Ziglar. If it's not true, it should be." This highlights the importance of goal setting, even if the specific study is a myth.
  - **Conclusion**: Goal setting is effective but requires effort, which is why many people do not engage in it.
