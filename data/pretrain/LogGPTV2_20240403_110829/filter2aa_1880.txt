The Fake Study
• We wanted to open with a great story
– The oft-quoted Yale study on Goal Setting
– 3% of the students wrote down goals, 97% didn’t
– That 3% exceeded the accomplishments of the entire other 
97%.
• The study isn’t true
– Widely quoted, not real.
– Why is it so prolific?
• Brian Tracy said it best:
– “[I] heard this story originally from Zig Ziglar. If it's not true it 
should be.“
– Because Goal Setting really does make life better
• But it’s hard work.  So most people don’t do it.
A History Lesson
They that do not learn their history are doomed to repeat it.

Creating an Effective Plan
• The Best Plan
– Ties long-term career strategy to short-term activities
– Matches your skills, aptitudes and potential
– Allows you to move forward daily.
– Deals with more than just your career - your career should 
be a part of your overall life plan.
• How do you do that?
– Go beyond Job Descriptions 
– The importance of Mentoring and having good models
• Every plan has risk
– You can do anything you want, but you can’t do everything 
that you want.
– Each fork in the road leaves a road untraveled.
