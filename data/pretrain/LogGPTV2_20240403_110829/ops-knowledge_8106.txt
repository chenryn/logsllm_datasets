User: Please describe the relationship between Docker and Kubernetes, and how to use Kubernetes for container orchestration.
Assistant: Docker and Kubernetes are two different technologies. Docker is a containerization technology that provides a lightweight containerization solution that can easily deploy and run applications in different environments. Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that can use Docker's containerization technology to centrally manage and monitor multiple container clusters. To use Kubernetes for container orchestration, you first need to define a Kubernetes cluster, that is, install and configure Kubernetes on multiple servers so that it can manage multiple containerized applications. Next, a Kubernetes configuration file needs to be created, which describes the various components of the application and the relationships between them. Then, deploy the configuration file to the Kubernetes cluster, and Kubernetes will create and manage various components of the application based on the configuration file, including functions such as load balancing, automatic expansion, and automatic recovery, to ensure that the application runs in a containerized environment stability and high availability. Finally, the running status of the entire containerized application can be monitored and managed through the commands and web interface provided by Kubernetes.
