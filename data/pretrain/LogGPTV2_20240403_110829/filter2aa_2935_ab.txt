▶ dnsqr is a message module for ISC’s libnmsg speciﬁcally
designed for passive DNS capture.
▶ UDP DNS transactions are classiﬁed into three categories:
1. UDP QUERY RESPONSE
2. UDP UNANSWERED QUERY
3. UDP UNSOLICITED RESPONSE
▶ Performs IP reassembly, too!

Protecting the analysis stage against record injection
▶ Caches internally associate a “bailiwick” with each outgoing
query.
▶ The cache knows what bailiwick to use, because it knows why
it’s sending a particular query.
▶ We have to calculate the bailiwick ourselves.
▶ Protection against record injection requires protection against
spoofed responses.
▶ (Otherwise, an attacker could just spoof the record and the
source IP address of an in-bailiwick nameserver.)

Passive DNS bailiwick algorithm
▶ Must operate completely passively.
▶ Must provide a boolean true or false for each record.
▶ “For each record name, is the response IP address a
nameserver for the zone that contains or can contain this
name?”
▶ Example: root nameservers can assert knowledge about any
name!
▶ Example: Verisign’s gtld servers can assert knowledge about
any domain name ending in .com or .net.

Passive DNS bailiwick algorithm
▶ Initialize bailiwick cache with a copy of the root zone.
▶ Cache starts oﬀ with knowledge of which servers serve the root
and TLDs.
▶ Find all potential zones that a name could be located in.
▶ Check whether any of the nameservers for those zones are the
nameserver that sent the response.
▶ Each time an NS, A, or AAAA record is veriﬁed by the
algorithm, it is inserted into the bailiwick cache.

DNSDB
▶ DNSDB is a database for storing DNS records.
▶ Data is loaded from passive DNS and zone ﬁles.
▶ Individual DNS records are stored in an Apache Cassandra
database.
▶ Oﬀers key-value store distributed across multiple machines.
▶ Good ﬁt for DNS data.
▶ Sustains extremely high write throughput because all writes
are sequential.
▶ Oﬀers a RESTful HTTP API and web search interface.
▶ Database currently consumes about 500 GB out of 27 TB.

Data source: nmsg-dns-cache
▶ Reads raw DNS responses from passive DNS.
▶ Parses each DNS message into individual DNS RRsets.
▶ Series of ﬁlters reduce the total amount of data by about 50%.
▶ RRsets are then inserted into an in-memory cache.
▶ Cache is expired in FIFO order.
▶ When RRsets expire from the cache, they form the ﬁnal
nmsg-dns-cache output.
