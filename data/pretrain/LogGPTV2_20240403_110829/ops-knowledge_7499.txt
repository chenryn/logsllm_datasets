User:  Please explain how virtualization technology improves system resource utilization.
Assistant: Virtualization technology can split a physical server into multiple virtual servers, each with its own operating system, applications and resources. These virtual servers share resources on a single physical server without requiring each virtual server to have its own hardware resources. With virtualization technology, resources can be easily allocated to different virtual servers and reallocated when needed to meet changes in demand. In addition, virtualization can provide greater control over resources (for example, the amount of CPU and memory that each virtual server can use can be limited), ensuring that the overall performance of the system is not affected by overuse of any one virtual server . Therefore, by implementing virtualization technology, the resources of physical servers can be better utilized, costs can be reduced, and system performance can be improved.
