**ATT&CK ID:** S1020  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** DNS Tunneling

**Description:**
DNS tunneling is a technique used to exfiltrate data from a compromised host by encoding the data within DNS queries and responses. This method allows an attacker to send information through a DNS-based command and control (C2) channel, effectively bypassing many network security controls that may not inspect DNS traffic as rigorously as other protocols.
