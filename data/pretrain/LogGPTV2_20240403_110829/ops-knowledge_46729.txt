User: I have a batch file that runs a python script. When the python script is invoked, it starts a second windows console and then disappears when it is completed. This is a problem because I am editing the PYTHONPATH environment variable in the batch file, but because the python script is running in a second window, it cannot see the edited PYTHONPATH environment variable. It used to work just fine (everything would run in the same windows console). I just installed Vista SP2 and this problem showed up. Any thoughts on how to fix what might be broken?
Thanks.
Assistant: Have you tried changing the extension of the python script to .pyw, or just invoke it with pythonw.exe?
