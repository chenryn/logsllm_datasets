# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
A 5 row NodeJS application, https://github.com/MorganLindqvist/webpack5-http-
auth-failure, works as it should without Webpack-5. But when running after
webpack the application crashes.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
`git clone https://github.com/MorganLindqvist/webpack5-http-auth-failure.git`  
`cd webpack5-http-auth-failure`  
`npm install`  
`npm run build_dev`  
`node dist/main.js`
The 5-row application that crashes is as follows:
    const auth = require("http-auth");
    const basic = auth.basic({
      realm: "Realm",
      file: __dirname + "/../htpasswd"
    });
**What is the expected behavior?**  
This small snippit is a part of a larger NodeJS application and the same
error/crash (see below) is triggered in that one when the usage of http-auth
module was added. The error message I receive s as follows:
`TypeError: Can not find node binding files from @node-rs/bcrypt-
linux-x64-gnu, @node-rs/bcrypt-linux-x64-gnux32, @node-rs/bcrypt-
linux-x64-musl and /home/user/webpack5-http-auth-
failure/dist/bcrypt.linux-x64-gnu.node, /home/user/webpack5-http-auth-
failure/dist/bcrypt.linux-x64-gnux32.node, /home/user/webpack5-http-auth-
failure/dist/bcrypt.linux-x64-musl.node `  
Until it is fixed, can I bypass it in some way?
