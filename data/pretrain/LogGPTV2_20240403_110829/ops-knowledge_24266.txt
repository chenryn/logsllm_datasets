User: I'm trying to run console commands via subprocess.Popen, and whenever I run it I get the windows "File not found" error, even when running the echo command.
I am also using Popen inside a thread made with the thread module. Is that the problem?
Assistant: echo is not an executable, it's an internal command inside cmd.exe. If you want to use Popen with internal commands, add a keyword parameter shell=True
