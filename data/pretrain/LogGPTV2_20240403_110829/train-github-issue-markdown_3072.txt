### Example Code
    from fastapi import FastAPI, CronTasks
    from time import sleep
    app = FastAPI()
    @app.on_event("startup")
    async def startup_event():
        await some_function()
    async def some_function(cron_tasks: CronTasks):
        cron_tasks.add_task(function = other_function, parameters = 'Some parameters', repeat_time = 216000) # Time in seconds; 24h = 216000
    async def other_function(parameters):
        print(parameters)
        sleep(3)
### Description
Call a cron tasks class in my controllers or events to set up repetitive
actions.
### Wanted Solution
When I launch my project with uvicorn I would like to have some cron tasks,
like background tasks but repeated over time instead of in the background.
### Wanted Code
    I haven't thought about the solution yet, but I could do it if it is interesting for the community.
