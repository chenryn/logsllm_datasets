User: I am writing a python script that will perform performance test in linux file system. so besides deadlocks, race conditions and time takes to perform an action (delete, read, write and create) what other variables/parameters should the test contain?
Assistant: You might be inetersting in looking at tools like caollectd and iotop.  Then again, yopu mightalso by interested in just using them instead of reinventing the wheel - as far as I see, such performance analysis is not learned in a day, and these guys invested significant amounts of time and knowledge in building these tools.
