I successfully created a ground foliage system using instanced buffer
geometry. Setting up the instancing wasn’t nearly as bad as I though it would
be, however one aspect was just downright tedious.
What I’m referring to is recreating the Lambert shader manually and then
adding in the custom orientation / position adjustments. This was necessary
for the foliage material to respect scene lighting / shadows etc. Rebuilding
the Lambert Material into a ShaderMaterial was not fun.
Would it not be easier to have a few for example: ShaderChunks[‘Instancing’]?
If I’m not overlooking anything, it would just require a few chunks, an
instancing_pars chunk which could contain the instancing attributes and
applyQuaternionToVector function (from three.js dev instancing examples), and
one right after the ‘begin_vertex’ chunk to alter the vec3 transformed
variable using the function.
Would this not be much more user friendly? If a user wants to take advantage
of instancing (who wouldn't), they simply have to set instancing: true on the
material and of course set up the needed buffer attributes. They would no
longer have to manually reconstruct an entire materials shader.
I've seen more complex examples of trying to ease usage of instancing, perhaps
we should start with something a little more simple like this?
I’d be more than happy to make a PR, if this is desirable.
