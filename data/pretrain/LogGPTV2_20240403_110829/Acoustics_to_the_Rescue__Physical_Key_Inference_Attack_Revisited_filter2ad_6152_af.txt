### Appendix A: Key Specifications

In Section 2, we explain the key specifications of pin-tumbler locks, which are responsible for the discrete nature of bittings and hence its associated fixed keyspace. In this section, we elaborate on the different specification parameters and their importance for our acoustic attack. The part of the key that enters the lock is known as the key blade, depicted in Figure 20, with its two ends known as the shoulder and the tip, respectively. Each key blade (for a particular lock system) has a unique profile, which is dictated by the bitting specification that is fixed by the manufacturer to ensure proper functioning of the key [63]. These bitting specifications, listed in the specification sheet provided by the lock manufacturer, indicate the number of bitting positions (generally 5-6), possible depth values per bitting (generally 7-10), width of each bitting (i.e., cut root), as well as the angle at the bitting position (i.e., cut angle). Additionally, each bitting depth is restricted to a set of uniformly-spaced discrete-valued depths, which differ from each other by an increment, also specified in the bitting specification. The distance between two adjacent bittings should be equal to the distance between two adjacent pins in the lock, i.e., its inter-pin distance (as shown in Figure 20), for its proper functioning. The consistency of key specification parameters is crucial to our attack as the modeling for simulated patterns would not be possible otherwise.

### Appendix B: Constraints on Keyspace

In Section 2, we briefly explain the factors responsible for constraining the keyspace of pin-tumbler locks. In this section, we elaborate on the various constraints added both for security and usability reasons, which ultimately result in considerable reduction to the keyspace. For any given lock and key model, due to the discrete nature of bitting depths, there is an upper bound on the maximum number of possible keys. For example, Schlage SC1 keys have 5 cut positions and 10 possible depths. Thus, the maximum number of Schlage SC1 keys that are possible is \(10^5\). However, in practice, the keyspace is close to 75% of the maximum, due to additional constraints imposed by the manufacturers for guaranteeing correct functioning of the keys, such as MACS (explained in Section 2). Apart from MACS, additional constraints, also known as coding rules [54], are imposed for usability reasons and for preventing trivial duplication by sight. We list these constraints:
1. Only two adjacent bittings can be of the same depth.
2. A total of three or fewer bittings can be of the same depth.
3. Three or more bittings must be of different depths.
4. The sequence of bittings should not monotonically increase from the shoulder to the tip-end of the key.

### Appendix C: Feasibility of Click Pattern Detection

To confirm that the click pattern is observed upon a key insertion, we perform a preliminary feasibility study to compare the simulation based on constant insertion speed against two experiments: a custom-designed setup using a linear actuator [13] that inserts a key into the lock at a constant speed of about 0.24 inches/sec, and a human insertion with an average speed of 5.4 inches/sec (about 20 times faster). Figure 21(a) depicts part of the resulting click pattern from the simulation, while Figures 21(b) and (c) depict the corresponding audio time-series produced by the linear actuator and human insertion, respectively. We observe that the time-series from the linear actuator closely resembles the click pattern, although obtaining such a pattern from human key insertion is challenging due to the much higher and inconsistent insertion speed. As we explain in Section 4, human key insertion causes smaller groups of clicks to aggregate together into what we refer to as "clusters," within which the average speed is higher (10.8 inches/sec) but is also more consistent. Furthermore, the time-interval between clicks is at least 0.66 ms (see Section 6.3.1), which causes the minimum detectable click-distance to be 7.2 milli-inches, resulting in some distinct clicks (separated by distances as small as 3 milli-inches) in the simulation to be missed during detection in human insertion.

### Appendix D: Simulated Patterns of Keys with Identical Bittings

As shown in Figure 22, a key with keycode 33333 (i.e., identical bittings values) has nine clicks (max = 15) in its simulated patterns, with two clicks in each cluster except the first. Such a pattern occurs because clicks due to all ridges, except ridge r1, overlap (i.e., occur simultaneously). Owing to the geometry of the key, when the adjacent bittings are equal, the horizontal position of the ridge in-between is exactly at their midpoint (e.g., when bittings, b1 = b2, ridge r2 is formed at the center of b1 and b2). More generally, the position of a ridge is determined by the difference between adjacent bittings. In the case of keys with all identical bittings, ridges {r2, r3, r4, r5} are located at the same location (i.e., midpoint) w.r.t. their adjacent bittings, hence causing the clicks due to them to overlap. On the other hand, the position of ridge r1, due to its unique placement at the tip of the key (see Figure 20), is determined by the value of a single bitting (b1) alone. Hence, clicks due to the first ridge do not overlap with clicks due to the rest of the ridges. We note that we discuss a key with equal bittings here for exemplary purposes. In reality, such keys are not valid as they do not satisfy the constraints listed in Appendix B.

### Appendix E: Participant Demographics

Table 2 provides the demographics of ten participants who took part in the testing phase where we study the effects of human attributes on keyspace reduction (see Section 6.4.3), as well as three participants who took part in the training phase. The participants consist of four females and nine males, with their ages ranging from 24 to 37. Of the thirteen participants, eight of them use physical keys on a daily basis. However, from our results, there seems to be no correlation between the regular usage of keys and the attack accuracy.
