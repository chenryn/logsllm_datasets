Appendix A Key Speciﬁcations
In Section 2, we explain the key speciﬁcations of pin-tumbler
locks, which are responsible for the discrete nature of bittings,
and hence its associated ﬁxed keyspace. In this section, we
elaborate on the different speciﬁcation parameters, and their
importance for our acoustic attack. The part of the key that
enters the lock is known as the key blade, depicted in Fig-
ure 20, with its two ends known as the shoulder and the tip,
respectively. Each key blade (for a particular lock system) has

a unique proﬁle, which is dictated by the bitting speciﬁcation
that is ﬁxed by the manufacturer to ensure proper functioning
of the key [63]. These bitting speciﬁcations, listed in the spec-
iﬁcation sheet provided by the lock manufacturer, indicate the
number of bitting positions (generally 5-6), possible depth
values per bitting (generally 7-10), width of each bitting (i.e.,
cut root), as well as, the angle at the bitting position (i.e., cut
angle). In addition, each bitting depth is restricted to a set of
uniformly-spaced discrete-valued depths, which differ from
each other by an increment, which is also speciﬁed in the
bitting speciﬁcation. Also, the distance between two adjacent
bittings should be equal to the distance between two adjacent
pins in the lock, i.e., its inter-pin distance (as shown in Fig-
ure 20), for its proper functioning. The consistency of key
speciﬁcation parameters is crucial to our attack as the model-
ing for simulated patterns would not be possible otherwise.
Appendix B Constraints on Keyspace
In Section 2, we brieﬂy explain the factors responsible for
constraining the keyspace of pin-tumbler locks. In this section,
we elaborate on the various constraints added both for security
as well as usability reasons, which ultimately result in consid-
erable reduction to the keyspace. For any given lock and key
model, due to the discrete nature of bitting depths, there is an
upper bound on the maximum number of possible keys. For
example, Schlage SC1 keys have 5 cut positions and 10 possi-
ble depths. Thus, the maximum number of Schlage SC1 keys
that are possible is 105. However, in practice, the keyspace is
close to 75% of the maximum, due to additional constraints
imposed by the manufacturers for guaranteeing correct func-
tioning of the keys, for example, MACS (explained in Sec-
tion 2). Apart from MACS, additional constraints, also known
as coding rules [54], are imposed for usability reasons and
for preventing trivial duplication by sight. We list these con-
straints: 1(cid:13) only two adjacent bittings can be of same depth,
2(cid:13) a total of three or fewer bittings can be of same depth,
3(cid:13) three or more bittings must be of different depth, and 4(cid:13)
sequence of bittings should not monotonically increase from

the shoulder to the tip-end of the key.
Appendix C Feasibility of Click Pattern De-
tection
In order to conﬁrm that the click pattern is observed upon
a key insertion, we perform a preliminary feasibility study
to compare the simulation based on constant insertion speed
against two experiments – a custom designed setup using a
linear actuator [13], such that it inserts a key into the lock at
a constant speed of about 0.24 inches/sec), as well as a hu-
man insertion with an average speed of 5.4 inches/sec (about
20 times faster). Figure 21(a) depicts part of the resulting
click pattern from the simulation, while Figures 21(b) and (c)
depict the corresponding audio time-series produced by the
linear actuator and human insertion, respectively. We observe
that time-series from the linear actuator closely resembles the
click pattern, although obtaining such a pattern from human
key insertion is challenging due to the much higher and incon-
sistent insertion speed. As we explain in Section 4, human key
insertion causes smaller group of clicks to aggregate together
into what we refer to as “clusters”, within which the average
speed is higher (10.8 inches/sec), but is also more consistent.
Furthermore, the time-interval between clicks is at least 0.66
ms (see Section 6.3.1), which causes the minimum detectable
click-distance to be 7.2 milli-inch, resulting in some distinct
clicks (separated by distances as small as 3 milli-inch) in
simulation to be missed during detection in human insertion.
Appendix D Simulated Patterns of Keys with
Identical Bittings
As shown in Figure 22, a key with keycode 33333 (i.e., identi-
cal bittings values) has nine clicks (max = 15) in its simulated
patterns, with two clicks in each cluster except the ﬁrst. Such a
pattern occurs because clicks due to all ridges, except ridge r1,
overlap (i.e., occur simultaneously). Owing to the geometry
of the key, when the adjacent bittings are equal, the horizontal
position of the ridge in-between, is exactly at their midpoint
Figure 22: Figure depicts the simulated patterns of a key with
keycode 33333, having nine clicks. In each cluster, clicks due
to ridge r1 are distinct from clicks due to all other ridges
which occur simultaneously, owing to the key’s geometry.
(e.g., when bittings, b1 = b2, ridge r2 is formed at the center
of b1 and b2). More generally, the position of a ridge is de-
termined by the difference between adjacent bittings. In the
case of keys with all identical bittings, ridges {r2, r3, r4, r5}
are located at the same location (i.e., midpoint) w.r.t their adja-
cent bittings, hence causing the clicks due to them to overlap.
On the other hand, the position of ridge r1, due to its unique
placement at the tip of the key (see Figure 20), is determined
by the value of a single bitting (b1) alone. Hence, clicks due
to the ﬁrst ridge do not overlap with clicks due to rest of the
ridges. We note that we discuss a key with equal bittings here
for exemplary purposes. In reality, such keys are not valid as
they do not satisfy the constraints listed in Appendix B.
Appendix E Participant Demographics
Table 2 provides the demographics of ten participants who
took part in the testing phase where we study the effects of
human attributes on keyspace reduction (see Section 6.4.3), as
well as three participants who took part in the training phase.
The participants consist of four females and nine males, with
their ages ranging from 24 to 37. Of the thirteen participants,
eight of them use physical keys on a daily basis. However,
from our results, there seems to be no correlation between the
regular usage of keys and the attack accuracy.
