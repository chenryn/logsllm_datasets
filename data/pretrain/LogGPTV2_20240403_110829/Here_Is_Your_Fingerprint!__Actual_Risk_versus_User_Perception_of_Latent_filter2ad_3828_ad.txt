### Study Methodology and Results

#### In-Person Survey and Semi-Structured Interviews
Participants were asked to demonstrate the following on their iPhones:
1. The unlocking action.
2. The Touch ID settings in "Settings - Touch ID & Passcode."
3. Actions for four scenarios: entering an incorrect passcode (1234), running an arbitrary app, typing an arbitrary text message, and swiping a screen menu several times.

These demonstrations allowed us to verify which fingers are used in practice and how many fingers are enrolled for Touch ID. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with participants who provided interesting or unusual responses, focusing on:
- The ease of using Touch ID.
- The security of Touch ID compared to passcodes.
- Satisfaction with Touch ID.
- Fingerprint enrollment.
- Perception of latent fingerprints.

These informal interactions provided deeper insights into unusual user behaviors and unexpected answers. All interviewees received a small gratuity ($10) for their participation.

#### Pilot Study
A pilot study with 10 participants helped us refine the in-person survey questionnaire and prepare the semi-structured interview questions.

#### Participant Recruitment
Participants were recruited from public places such as coffee shops and shopping malls around a local university. We used various methods, including message boards, flyer distribution, and direct approaches, to reach a diverse group of participants aged 19 or older, with iPhones that supported Touch ID (iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus). Users who had never used Touch ID, even if they had a compatible model, were excluded. This recruitment method was chosen to ensure precise data collection on Touch ID usage. Before the survey, we did not disclose the detailed purpose to avoid bias, but we clearly stated that the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).

#### Hypotheses
To address the research questions introduced in Section 1, we formulated the following hypotheses:
- **H01**: There is no difference in the distribution of the most frequently used fingers between Touch ID and touch screen interactions.
- **H11**: There is a difference in the distribution of the most frequently used fingers between Touch ID and touch screen interactions.
- **H02**: User perception of latent fingerprints has no effect on the risk perception for Touch ID.
- **H12**: User perception of latent fingerprints affects the risk perception for Touch ID.

### Results

#### Demographics
We initially recruited 84 participants but excluded two due to failed response validation. Out of the remaining 82 participants (52 male, 30 female), three were left-handed. Ages ranged from 19 to 58, with an average age of 30 (SD = 8). Fifty-six participants had owned their iPhones for more than two years, while 11 had owned them for less than a year. All participants had previously owned another smartphone. Three participants (e.g., P16) were not using Touch ID despite having experience with it. After the in-person survey, 11 participants were asked for semi-structured interviews, and nine agreed.

#### Touch ID Experience
Participants rated their Touch ID experience on a five-level Likert scale. The results are summarized in Figure 8. Most participants were satisfied with Touch ID, but some expressed dissatisfaction. For example:
- **P16** turned off Touch ID due to frequent failures and concerns about fingerprint storage.
- **P62** found Touch ID difficult to use when his finger was wet or dirty and preferred passcodes.
- **P10** strongly disagreed with the security of Touch ID, noting that once a fingerprint is compromised, it cannot be changed.
- **P29** and **P70** experienced difficulties with fingerprint enrollment and poor recognition.

#### Finger Preferences for Touch ID
Participants were asked about their preferred fingers for enrolling and unlocking with Touch ID. On average, 2.7 (SD = 1.246) fingers were enrolled, with a maximum of five possible. The right thumb was the most commonly enrolled (46 participants), followed by the left thumb and index fingers. Only a few participants enrolled the middle or little fingers. For unlocking, the right thumb was the most used, followed by the right index finger and left thumb (Figure 9).

#### Finger Preferences for Touch Screen
Participants were asked about their preferred fingers for using the iPhone on a touch screen, such as for passcode typing, app selection, text typing, and swiping. The right thumb (51), left thumb (46), and right index finger (39) were the most frequently used. The distribution of fingers used in each scenario is shown in Figure 9.

#### Risk Perception and Latent Fingerprints
Participants were asked about their perception of the risk of circumventing Touch ID and the presence of latent fingerprints on their iPhone. Fifty-two participants felt it was difficult to circumvent Touch ID, while 10 disagreed. Forty-eight participants believed that latent fingerprints remained on their iPhone after use, while 34 did not (Figure 10).

### Hypothesis Testing

#### H01 and H11
Using the Cochran Q Test, we compared the major fingers (right thumb and right index finger) across all conditions (Touch ID, passcode typing, app selection, text typing, and swiping). The test did not reveal any significant difference (Q(4) = 2.8, p = .592), leading us to fail to reject H01. This suggests that users may employ the same major fingers on both Touch ID and the touch screen.

#### H02 and H12
Using the Chi-square test, we compared the risk perception of Touch ID between participants who perceived latent fingerprints and those who did not. The test did not reveal any significant difference (χ²(3) = 5.777, p = .123), leading us to fail to reject H02. This implies that users may not perceive the risk of Touch ID due to latent fingerprints.

### Limitations
Our sample size was small (n = 82) and primarily consisted of right-handed, local residents. This limitation was due to the in-person nature of the surveys and follow-up validation. For left-handed individuals, we expect reverse results in finger preferences. Long-term field observations were lacking, though we directly observed participants' behavior during response validation.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Technical Solutions
- **Larger Sensing Device**: A larger sensor can capture fingerprints more accurately and quickly. Future iPhones and other smartphones are expected to embed Touch ID under the screen, which should improve sensing area and quality.
- **Self-Erasing Mechanism**: We propose a modified "slide bar" mechanism, where users swipe a virtual bar to unlock, thereby removing latent fingerprints (Figure 11).

#### Behavioral Solutions
- **User Attention and Good Habits**: Educate users about the risks of latent fingerprints and recommend self-removal after unlocking. Encourage the use of less common fingers, such as the little finger, for Touch ID to minimize the risk of latent fingerprints on the touch screen.

By combining these technical and behavioral strategies, we aim to mitigate the security risks associated with latent fingerprints and enhance the overall security of Touch ID.
