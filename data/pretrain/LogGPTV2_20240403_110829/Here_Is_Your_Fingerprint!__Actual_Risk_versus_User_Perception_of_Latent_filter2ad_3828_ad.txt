to show us the followings in order: (1) unlocking action of their
iPhone, (2) options for Touch ID in “Se(cid:138)ings - Touch ID & Passcode”
menu on their iPhone, and (3) actions for four scenarios (entering
an imitation passcode 1234, running an arbitrary app, typing an
arbitrary text message, swiping a screen menu several times). (cid:140)ese
in-person communications allowed us to verify which (cid:128)ngers are
used in practice and how many (cid:128)ngers are enrolled for Touch ID.
We additionally asked a short semi-structured interview (taking
less than 20 min) to some of those participants who stated their
answers interesting or unusual to us for speci(cid:128)c questions, e.g., the
easiness of using Touch ID, security of Touch ID in comparison with
passcode, satisfaction of Touch ID, (cid:128)ngerprint enrollment, percep-
tion of latent (cid:128)ngerprint. (cid:140)ese informal interactions allowed us to
understand unusual user behavior in depth and expect unforeseen
answers to those questions. All interviewees were given a small
gratuity ($10) again for their participation.
A pilot study with 10 participants allowed us to revise in-person
survey questionnaire and prepare semi-structured interview.
Participant Recruitment. We recruited participants in public
places including co(cid:130)ee shops and shopping malls around a local
university. We used several ways such as message boards, (cid:131)yers dis-
tribution, and direct approach in order to reach diverse participants
who were 19 years old or older and whose iPhone supported Touch
ID (iPhone 5S, 6, 6 Plus, 6S, and 6S Plus). We excluded such iPhone
users who had never used Touch ID even with a proper model. We
chose this recruitment method for precise data collection on Touch
ID usages. Before beginning the survey, we did not mention a de-
tailed purpose of this survey not to give any bias, but we de(cid:128)nitely
stated our study was conducted with the approval of the IRB.
Hypotheses. To answer the research questions, Q2.1 and Q2.2
introduced in Section 1, we formulated the following hypotheses:
: (cid:140)ere is no di(cid:130)erence in distribution of the most fre-
quently used (cid:128)ngers between on Touch ID and on a touch screen.
: (cid:140)ere is a di(cid:130)erence in distribution of the most frequently

5.2 Results
Demographics. We originally recruited 84 participants but neces-
sarily excluded answers from two participants who failed response
validation. Out of 82 participants (52 self-identi(cid:128)ed as male and
30 as female), three participants were le(cid:137)-handed. (cid:140)e age was
between 19 and 58 years, and the average age was 30 (SD = 8).
Speci(cid:128)cally, 56 participants answered that they owned iPhones for
more than two years while 11 participants owned iPhones for less
than a year. All participants answered that they had owned another

smartphone before the current one. We found that three partici-
pants (e.g., P16) were not using Touch ID although they had a Touch
ID experience. A(cid:137)er in-person survey, we asked 11 participants for
semi-structured interview and nine participants agreed.
Touch ID Experience. We asked all participants about their Touch
ID experience in a (cid:128)ve-level Likert scale. (cid:140)e result is summarized
in Figure 8. All participants had Touch ID experience but three
of them (e.g., P16) stated that they were not using it currently. 56
participants stated that they unlock their iPhones more than once
per hour while 13 participants answered once per hour.
Overall, we found that the majority of participants were satis(cid:128)ed
with Touch ID, but we interviewed some of those participants whose
experience were not indeed. Participant P16 stated that he turned
o(cid:130) Touch ID because he experienced many failures when using it.
Furthermore, he worried about storing (cid:128)ngerprints in his iPhone
because of malware or possible loss. P62 disagreed on the easiness
of using Touch ID because he experienced many failures when
a (cid:128)nger was wet or dirty. He rather actively expressed that the
passcode unlocking method would be easier to use when a (cid:128)nger is
in poor condition. P10 strongly disagreed on the security of Touch
ID because a (cid:128)ngerprint already enrolled to Touch ID can not be
changed when its information is leaked to others. He stated that
on the contrary a passcode can be easily changed and updated.
(cid:140)us, he thought Touch ID was much less secure than passcode.
P29 was not satis(cid:128)ed with Touch ID because he experienced a great
di(cid:129)culty when enrolling his (cid:128)ngerprints and when trying to share
his iPhone with families. P70 expressed that it was very di(cid:129)cult
to enroll his (cid:128)ngerprints to Touch ID because he had to try it with
repeated touch actions on a home bu(cid:138)on and (cid:128)nally experienced
poor recognition. He also stated that he had a great doubt and
worry about security because he thought so many (cid:128)ngerprints
were recorded by Touch ID.
Preference for Fingers on Touch ID. We asked participants
about their preference for (cid:128)ngers to enroll or unlock with Touch
ID. We asked them about those (cid:128)ngers the most frequently used.
As for the number of (cid:128)ngerprints enrolled with Touch ID, 40
participants stated that they enrolled one or two (cid:128)ngerprints while
28 participants answered four or (cid:128)ve. (cid:140)e average was 2.7 (SD =

1.246) although at most (cid:128)ve (cid:128)ngerprints were possible to enroll
(e.g., P61). We found that some participants (e.g., P62) conducted
multiple enrollment of the same (cid:128)nger. As for the (cid:128)ngers enrolled,
the most enrolled was the right thumb (46 participants) followed
by the le(cid:137) thumb and the index (cid:128)ngers. Only three participants
enrolled the middle (cid:128)nger and one participant (P25) enrolled the
li(cid:138)le (cid:128)nger. As for the (cid:128)ngers employed for unlocking with Touch
ID, participants answered that the most used (cid:128)nger was the right
thumb followed by the right index (cid:128)nger and the le(cid:137) thumb.
(cid:140)e distribution of the most used (cid:128)ngers is summarized in Fig-
ure 9. (cid:140)ere was a signi(cid:128)cant skewing in the distribution of (cid:128)ngers

a reverse result for le(cid:137)-handed users because the majority of our
participants were right-handed. Overall, we found that the majority
of participants had preference for thumbs and index (cid:128)ngers on
Touch ID, but we interviewed some of those participants whose
preference was unusual or whose enrollment method was interest-
ing. P25 stated that she enrolled the right li(cid:138)le (cid:128)nger because she
had experienced failures in unlocking with Touch ID when she ate
something with her (cid:128)ngers (probably, with the other four (cid:128)ngers).
She expressed that she happily used Touch ID with the li(cid:138)le (cid:128)nger
a(cid:137)erwards. P62 stated that he conducted multiple enrollment of
the same (cid:128)nger because he experienced many failures when using
Touch ID. He claimed that he felt a be(cid:138)er response of Touch ID af-
terwards. P61 said that he enrolled (cid:128)ve (cid:128)ngerprints because Touch
ID allowed it. (cid:140)ere was no special reason for the full enrollment.
Preference for Fingers on Touch Screen. We asked participants
about their preference for (cid:128)ngers to use iPhone on a touch screen,
e.g., for Passcode typing, App selection, Text typing, and Scroll /
Swiping. We asked participants about those (cid:128)ngers used the most
(See Figure 16 in Appendix F). Overall, our participants answered
that the right thumb (51), the le(cid:137) thumb (46), and the right index
(cid:128)nger (39) were frequently and preferably used. (cid:140)e distribution of
(cid:128)ngers used the most of each scenario are shown in Figure 9.
Overall, we found that the majority of participants had pref-
erence for thumbs and index (cid:128)ngers on a touch screen in every
2(9) = 406.3, p < .001, and other 3 scenarios were
scenario (e.g. χ
very similar. See Table 3 in Appendix G), which implies that it
should be highly possible to (cid:128)nd latent (cid:128)ngerprints of the same
(cid:128)ngers on both Touch ID and a touch screen. Indeed in validation,

ceived latent (cid:128)ngerprints le(cid:133) on iPhone. Group 2 did not.
we observed participants usually employed the (cid:128)ngers that they
used on Touch ID, on a touch screen. We also observed that both
thumbs were highly employed by participants in validation of Text
typing because of typing with both hands.
Perception of Risk and Latent Fingerprints. We (cid:128)rst asked par-
ticipants in a (cid:128)ve-level Likert scale if they felt that it would be easy
for someone to circumvent Touch ID in part B1 of our survey. We
then asked them about their perception of latent (cid:128)ngerprints re-
maining on a surface of iPhone with closed (yes or no) questions in
part B2 of our survey. In B2, we explained about latent (cid:128)ngerprints
remaining as touch action smudges on the surface of smartphones:
Smudges could contain partial information about user’s (cid:128)ngerprints.
As for the risk perception of Touch ID, 52 participants answered
that it is di(cid:129)cult or very di(cid:129)cult to circumvent Touch ID but 10
participants disagreed (e.g., P70). As for the perception of latent
(cid:128)ngerprints, 48 participants (e.g., P21) answered ‘yes’, i.e., they
perceived that latent (cid:128)ngerprints remained on iPhone a(cid:137)er they
use. (cid:140)e other participants (e.g., P46) answered ‘no’. (cid:140)e distribution
of risk perception of Touch ID is shown in Figure 10. P70 stated
that the size of Touch ID sensor was too small in comparison with
other (cid:128)ngerprint sensors, e.g., used at the airport. So he worried
that another person who had a similar (cid:128)ngerprint or was able to
fake the (cid:128)ngerprint could easily circumvent Touch ID. He also
worried that (cid:128)ngerprints were repeatedly taken by Touch ID. As for
the perception of latent (cid:128)ngerprints, P21 answered ‘yes’ because
she found latent (cid:128)ngerprints on her iPhone when she was on a
survey. She explained that people might fail to notice them, but
rather just perceive them as dirty smudges, unless they were taught
about the risk. P46 answered ‘no’ because he usually put his iPhone
in a pocket or a bag. He expressed that such (cid:128)ngerprints should
automatically be removed because of consecutive contacts with
other materials. Interestingly, he showed his iPhone from his pocket
as a proof, but we together found latent (cid:128)ngerprints on his home
bu(cid:138)on and touch screen.
5.3 Hypothesis Testing
Before a hypothesis test, we observed in the pilot test that partici-
pants’ (n = 10, right-handed) (cid:128)ngers were strongly skewed towards
the right thumb and the right index (cid:128)nger. Accordingly, we were
able to classify 10 (cid:128)ngers into two categories, such as major and
other (cid:128)ngers, with regard to using smartphones. (cid:140)e right thumb
and the right index (cid:128)nger were classi(cid:128)ed as the major (cid:128)ngers, and
the others as the other (cid:128)ngers. As shown in Figure 9, we were able to
observe the similar results in our survey, in which the participants

were mostly right-handed (only three were le(cid:137)-handed). (cid:140)erefore,
we employed this classi(cid:128)cation in our hypothesis test. We coded
participants in each condition (Touch ID, Passcode typing, App
selection, Text typing, and Swiping) as follows. If a participant’s
selection for the (cid:128)nger used the most falls into the major (cid:128)ngers cat-
egory, we coded the participant as 1 in the corresponding condition,
and otherwise we coded as 0. To test hypothesis H1, we used the
Cochran Q Test [9], which is the extension of the McNemar’s test
and is used to verify whether k treatments have identical e(cid:130)ects.
(cid:140)e test required binary responses for two or more treatments by
within subjects. Our data were suitable for the test’s requirement.
We compared the major (cid:128)ngers in all conditions including Touch
ID. (cid:140)e result of the Cochran Q Test did not reveal any signi(cid:128)cant
di(cid:130)erence (Q(4) = 2.8, p = .592) between all conditions. Overall,
we were unable to reject H null
. (cid:140)is implies that users may employ
the major (cid:128)ngers on both Touch ID and touch screen.
To test H2, we used the Chi-square test for the user perception of
latent (cid:128)ngerprints and the risk perception. We split the participants
who perceived the latent (cid:128)ngerprints (48) and who did not (34) (See
Figure 10). (cid:140)e results of the Chi-square test did not reveal any sig-
ni(cid:128)cant di(cid:130)erence between the two groups for the risk perception
2(3) = 5.777, p = .123, ‘Strongly Agree’ and ‘Agree’
of Touch ID (χ
were integrated by the Cramer Rule). Hence, we were unable to
reject H null
. (cid:140)is implies that users may not perceive the risk of
Touch ID because of the latent (cid:128)ngerprints le(cid:137) on the smartphone.

5.4 Limitations
Our sample was small (n = 82) and had some biases - local residents
mostly right-handed. (cid:140)is limitation happened because we aimed at
in-person surveys followed by direct validation and selective inter-
views. As for the le(cid:137)-handed group, we expect reverse results only
in the preference for (cid:128)ngers. We were lack of a longer-term (cid:128)eld
observation although we were able to directly observe participants’
behavior during response validation following the surveys.
6 MITIGATION
To deal with the SCRAP a(cid:138)ack, we discuss two mitigation methods,
one conceived from our experimental study in a technical sense
and the other obtained from our survey study in a behavioral sense.
From the technical side, a larger sensing device is an essential
requirement because such a sensor can more accurately capture
(cid:128)ngerprints of a larger area in a shorter time. Indeed, in our exper-
imental study, we exploited the small touch sensor that actually
captures a smaller area in lower quality on the smartphones. Fortu-
nately, it is expected to embed Touch ID under a touch screen in the
next generation iPhone, maybe a(cid:137)er iPhone X [12, 21, 36] (See Ap-
pendix H), and also other manufacturers making similar e(cid:130)orts for
their next smartphones. (cid:140)e possibility of the under-screen sensor
must be a good chance to enlarge the size of Touch ID. So, we claim
that the under-screen sensor must ensure to have a su(cid:129)ciently
large sensing area and imaging quality. Note that however a latent
(cid:128)ngerprint would still remain on the touch screen a(cid:137)er unlocking
with under-screen sensors. Although an anti-(cid:128)ngerprint (cid:128)lm could
be a considerable solution to this case, it is infeasible to enforce
such a (cid:128)lm to users, and so we rather consider a self-erasing mech-
anism [27]. We propose the recall of the “slide bar” that actually
well-accepted in the early iPhone models, with slight modi(cid:128)cation.
Figure 11 illustrates our mitigation idea that leads a user to remove
the latent (cid:128)ngerprint, still with unconsciousness. Under-screen
Touch ID may reside around the circle of Figure 11-(a). A user is
then required to slide the circle to le(cid:137) or right for unlocking with
Touch ID. Figures 11-(b) and (c) show such familiar behavior while
the latent (cid:128)ngerprint is removed a(cid:137)er unlocking.
From the behavioral side, user a(cid:138)ention and good habits are es-
sential requirements for security. In our survey study, we observed
that one participant (P25) employs her li(cid:138)le (cid:128)nger for Touch ID,
which is rarely or never used on a touch screen. She actually chose
the li(cid:138)le (cid:128)nger for her convenience, but here we think that this
strategy can be generalized for security in the behavioral sense. It is
also necessary to educate users about the risk of latent (cid:128)ngerprints
and recommend a self-removal a(cid:137)er unlocking with Touch ID, but
it is well-known di(cid:129)cult to remind users of the risk in every use.
(cid:140)us, as learned, we also propose to ask a user to enroll (cid:128)ngers,
