### What did you do?
    // This is an exact, unaltered copy-paste of the code I'm running.  I trimmed my live code
    // down to just this function body in order to test/reproduce
    func (l *logger) close(timeout time.Duration) error {
        fmt.Println("before select")
        select {
        case <-time.After(time.Second):
            fmt.Println("timeout occurred")
            return errors.New("timeout")
        }
    }
### What did you expect to see?
I should see "before select" printed. Then after 1 second, I should see
"timeout occurred" printed.
### What did you see instead?
I see "before select" printed. Nothing else prints and the program never
exits. This is definitely the only function in my code that prints "before
select", so the close method is called, but the channel read from the
time.After channel never happens. I've noticed the program spins my CPU at
100% while I'm waiting for the timeout that never occurs.
### Other
I can only reproduce this when I add a panic() to one of my functions and
recover from the panic. The "close" method shown above runs on program
termination, after the panic recovery. If I modify the panicking code to
return nil in place of the panic, I can't reproduce. That portion of code is
outside of this close method. I also can't reproduce if I remove the select
and read directly from the channel.
I ripped apart my code trying to find the cause of the hanging select. I
uploaded a functioning but mangled/stripped copy of the code to
https://github.com/bobziuchkovski/golang-select-repro. The code itself hardly
makes sense anymore, but it runs and reproduces the hanging select about 1 in
8 times on my laptop.
The select in question is in logger.go on line 110. The panic is triggered in
main.go on line 45. If I comment-out that panic, I can't reproduce the hanging
select. The close method with the select in question is triggered indirectly
via line 40 of main.go
