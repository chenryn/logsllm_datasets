    1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?
    package foo
    type Foo interface {
        X()
    }
    func Test(f Foo) {
        _ = f.(struct{Foo})
    }
    package main
    import (
        "local/foo"
    )
    func main() {
        foo.Test(nil)
    }
    2. What is the full compiler output?
    ./tst.go:3: impossible type assertion:
        struct {} does not implement foo.Foo (missing X method)
    ./tst.go:7: internal compiler error: typename 
    3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)
    6g version go1.1.2
    This might be the same as issue #5974.
