User: What happens to a website's server when it is under a DDoS attack? What steps should be taken to mitigate such attacks?
Assistant: When the server of a certain website is attacked by DDoS, the server may respond slowly or fail to respond normally, which may even lead to serious consequences such as server downtime and data loss. In order to mitigate DDoS attacks, the following measures can be taken: 1. Increase the bandwidth of the server so that it can better withstand the attack traffic. 2. Set up a website firewall to block the source IP address so that it cannot access the server. 3. Enable the attack detection system, which can accurately detect attack traffic and block abnormal traffic. 4. Strengthen security authentication and limit the access of illegal users. 5. Using CDN service can provide distributed cache service and improve the usability of the website. 6. Upgrade server software and operating system, fix loopholes and weaknesses, and improve server security. 7. Back up website data to deal with the risk of data loss.
