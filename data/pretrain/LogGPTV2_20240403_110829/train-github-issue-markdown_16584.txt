Symfony version | 3.2.6  
According to the documentation the default value of the `empty_data` option to
`\Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\Core\Type\TextType` is the empty string
`''`:

But I found when using 3.2.6, that the default of `empty_data` is actually
`null`.  
I’m not sure if or where in the code this is actually defined, so I could not
check against it.
