APPENDIX A
PROOF OF THEOREM 1
We show the analysis about SybilWalk. Analysis for
SybilWalk-Var is similar, so we omit it for simplicity.
Overview:
Initially, Sybils have higher badness scores than
benign nodes on average. In each iteration of SybilWalk, the
average badness score of Sybil nodes decreases while the
average badness scores of benign nodes increases. Our key
idea is to derive the decrease of the average badness score
of Sybil nodes and the increase of the average badness score
of benign nodes in each iteration. Then, we can analyze the
decrease of the average badness score of Sybil nodes and
increase of the average badness score of benign nodes after a
certain number of iterations. For a fast-mixing benign region,
after log n iterations, benign nodes have similar badness scores.
Suppose the decrease of the average badness scores of Sybil
nodes all focus on a subset of Sybils. If we want this subset
of Sybils to decrease badness scores to be smaller than benign
nodes, then this subset of Sybils is bounded as O( g log n
d(s) ),
where d(s) is the average degree of Sybil nodes.
Notations: We ﬁrst deﬁne some notations. G = (V, E)
denotes a social graph. For a node set N, we denote its volume
as the sum of (weighted) degrees of nodes in N, i.e., V ol(N)
u∈N du, where du is the (weighted) degree of node u.

score of benign nodes in the tth iteration. Initially, P (0)

Ranking analysis: We assume after w iterations, benign
nodes have similar badness scores, which are the average
badness score of benign nodes. For a fast-mixing benign
region, w = O(log n). Suppose we have ns Sybils. After
w = O(log n) iterations, we assume the decrease of badness
score of Sybil nodes all focus on nss Sybils, which gives an
upper bound of Sybils whose badness scores are smaller than
benign nodes. If we want these Sybil nodes to have badness
scores that are smaller than benign nodes, then we have:

we denote by D(t) as the difference between the average
badness score of benign nodes and that of Sybil nodes in the
tth iteration. Formally, we have:
D(t) = P (t)
− P (t)
s ,

b
where D(0) < 0 is the initial badness score difference. This
difference comes from the initialized settings of badness scores
for the label nodes and the labeled nodes in the training dataset.
Note that, we assume there are no label noises.
Decrease of average badness score of Sybil nodes and
increase of average badness score of benign nodes in the
(t + 1)th iteration:
In the (t + 1)th iteration, the expected
average badness score of Sybil nodes and the expected average
badness score of benign nodes can be approximated as follows:
