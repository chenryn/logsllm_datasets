### Shotgun Forensics
Shotgun forensics involves a haphazard, unguided approach to forensic investigations:
- **"Old school" methods**
- **Imaging everything**
- **Relying heavily on automated tools**
- **Pulling the plug (immediate shutdown)**

### Sniper Forensics
Sniper forensics takes a targeted, deliberate approach to forensic investigations:
- **Develop a detailed investigation plan**
- **Apply sound logical principles:**
  - **Locard's Exchange Principle**
  - **Occam's Razor**
  - **Alexiou Principle**
- **Extract only the necessary data**
- **Let the data guide the answers**
- **Document all findings and actions**
- **Address the key questions**

### The Three-Phase Breach Triad
1. **Infiltration:**
   - How did the attacker gain access to the system(s)?
2. **Aggregation:**
   - What actions did the attacker perform?
     - What data was stolen?
3. **Exfiltration:**
   - How did the attacker exit the system?
     - How was the stolen data removed from the system?

*This concept, often referred to as the "Breach Triad," is credited to Colin Sheppard, Incident Response Director at SpiderLabs.*

### Expert Opinions on Investigation Planning
**Q: How important is a clear plan for a forensic investigation?**

**Harlan Carvey, VP of Advanced Security Projects, Terremark/Author:**
- "It's paramount... whether you develop the plan from scratch or start with documented processes. If you have a plan and miss something, you can determine what you missed; without a plan, you can't do that."

**Jesse Kornblum, Senior Forensic Scientist, Mantech:**
- "An investigative plan is critical. It should describe what you're looking for, how you'll know when you've found it, and when to stop. Without it, an investigation can become mired or unfocused."

**Rob Lee, Principal Consultant, Mandiant/SANS:**
- "You cannot just hope to find the evil. You must know what you are looking for, what you need to prove, and use a combination of scientific analysis and proven techniques to find it."

**Auston Davis, Senior Manager, Global Cyber-Threat Response, Symantec/OSI Officer, USAF:**
- "A clear plan of attack is absolutely paramount, especially in environments where a forensic team may not be welcome. It allows the investigator to conduct their work efficiently and deliberately."

### Guiding Principles
1. **Locard’s Exchange Principle**
2. **Occam’s Razor**
3. **The Alexiou Principle**

### Locard’s Exchange Principle
- **Established by Edmund Locard (1877-1966)**
- **Considered the father of modern forensics**
- **Uses deductive reasoning:**
  - **Example:**
    - All good forensic investigators are bald.
    - Harlan Carvey is bald.
    - Therefore, Harlan Carvey is a good forensic investigator.

### Occam’s Razor
- **Established by William of Occam (13th-century Franciscan Friar)**
- **Major contributor to medieval thought and Aristotelian logic**
- **The simplest answer is usually the correct one:**
  - **Modern interpretation: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
  - **Avoid speculation and let the data speak for itself**

*Copyright © Trustwave 2009. Confidential.*

### The Alexiou Principle
- **Documented by Mike Alexiou, VP, Engagement Services, Terremark:**
  - **What question are you trying to answer?**
  - **What data do you need to answer that question?**
  - **How do you extract and analyze that data?**
  - **What does the data tell you?**

### Creating an Investigation Plan
- **Define your goals:**
  - **Write them down clearly and concisely.**
  - **Ensure they are specific and attainable.**
  - **Identify success indicators:**
    - **What will it look like when you find what you are looking for?**
    - **Seriously consider this step.**
  - **Align with the client:**
    - **Define and deliver on expectations.**
    - **Provide what you promised.**

*Plan the work and work the plan:*
- **Answer the questions you ask yourself.**
- **Show your work.**
- **If an answer cannot be found, provide negative evidence.**

### Importance of the Investigation Plan
- **This is the most crucial phase of the investigation process.**
- **Failure here jeopardizes the entire case.**
- **You cannot simply be asked to "find the bad guy stuff" and walk away.**
- **Identify the target, lock on, and engage.**

### Data Reduction
- **Determine what is "normal."**
- **Eliminate normal data from your view.**
- **Focus on the abnormal data.**
- **Generate leads.**
- **Document your process, rationale, and results.**
- **Address new questions that arise.**

### Volatile Data Gathering
- **Critical to the investigation:**
  - **Often the only chance to review the live system.**
  - **Attackers may still be present.**
  - **Malware is running in its original state.**
  - **This is the crime scene.**
- **Gather as much data as possible:**
  - **Use trusted tools.**
  - **Understand your footprint and be able to account for it.**
- **Review during image acquisition:**
  - **Monitor for major developments in minutes.**
  - **Leverage customer knowledge of their system.**
  - **Integrate findings into the investigation plan.**

### Volatile Data Analysis
- **Understand the system's intended function:**
  - **Primary purpose of the system.**
  - **Define what "normal" looks like.**
  - **Use the customer's knowledge of their system.**
- **Evaluate current activity:**
  - **Running processes:**
    - **What is running?**
    - **From where?**
    - **Why?**
  - **Network connections:**
    - **What connections are being made?**
    - **To where?**
    - **Why?**
