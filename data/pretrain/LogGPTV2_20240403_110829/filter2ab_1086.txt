### Title: BlackHat US-21 ERROR: BadAlloc! - Vulnerable Memory Allocators Impact Millions of IoT and Embedded Devices

**Abstract:**

"BadAlloc" is the codename for a class of integer-overflow related security vulnerabilities found in the core functions of popular memory allocators, such as `malloc` and `calloc`. These vulnerabilities affect 17 widely used real-time operating systems (e.g., VxWorks, FreeRTOS, eCos), standard C libraries (e.g., newlib, uClibc, Linux klibc), IoT device SDKs (e.g., Google Cloud IoT SDK, Texas Instruments SimpleLink SDK), and other applications with custom memory management (e.g., Redis). Some of these vulnerabilities date back to the early 1990s and collectively impact millions of devices worldwide, primarily in the IoT and embedded systems space.

In this presentation, we will highlight some of the most significant findings and discuss the methods we used to discover them. We will conduct a detailed root-cause analysis for each selected case and demonstrate, at a high technical level, how these vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve full remote code execution (RCE) on affected systems. We will also explore potential mitigation techniques and propose a method to determine if your application is vulnerable to BadAlloc or similar issues. Finally, we will present a live demonstration of a working RCE exploit.

**Key Points:**
- **Vulnerability Overview:** Introduction to the BadAlloc class of vulnerabilities and their widespread impact.
- **Discovery Methods:** Techniques and tools used to identify the vulnerabilities.
- **Technical Analysis:** In-depth examination of the root causes and exploitation mechanisms.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Recommendations for mitigating the risks associated with BadAlloc.
- **Live Demonstration:** A practical example of an RCE exploit leveraging a BadAlloc vulnerability.

This session aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the BadAlloc vulnerabilities and equip attendees with the knowledge to protect their systems and applications from these critical security threats.
