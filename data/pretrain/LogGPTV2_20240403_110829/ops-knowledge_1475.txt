User: I have a Python application on AppEngine that requires users to log in.
Is there any way to write a log entry on logging in?
Users could hit the log in screen from any URL and will reload pages throughout their session so adding it to code would add numerous entries when all I want is one at the point of authentication.
Assistant: Log only if its been some time since they entered the app.
if you really want to do it at the login level hou can but you will need to setup SSO on the domain.
