5.2  Non-Repudiation  
Non-repudiation is one of the security services 
required  by  “advanced”  e-commerce  transactions. 
Non-repudiation requires client-side certificates that 
bind  the  user’s  signing  key  with  their  name.  The 
process  of  generating  the  signing  keys  and  of 
generating  the  user’s  signing  certificate  must  be 
“secure” (requirements are often legislated and vary 
from  country  to  country),  so  that  the  user  cannot 
repudiate  a

transaction  based  on 
the  user 
To support the requirement for non-repudiation, 
the WAP browser (on the WAP device) provides a 
WMLScript 
function,  Crypto.signText() 
[11]. It is somewhat similar to JavaScript/Java in the 
Internet  environment.  This  function  will  require  a 
user  to  sign  a  string  of  text.  A  call  to  the 
signText() method displays the text to be signed 
and  asks 
for  confirmation.  Some 
implementations  may require the user to enter data

implementations  will

After  the  data  has  been  signed  and  both  the

5.3  The Security GAP 
Security “gaps” appear when a secure session is 
terminated “prematurely”. For example, consider an 
intended  end-to-end  secure  application  using  SSL 
between  components  A  and  B,  passing  through 
component Z (see Figure 8). A security gap would 
result if the SSL session (supposedly between A and 
B  via  Z)  was  broken  at  component  Z  and  re-
established  between  Z  and  B.  This  would  result  in 
two secure sessions, between A and Z and between 
Z and B. The message would be secure while on the 
network,  but  would  be  in  an  insecure  state  on 
component Z. 
The  risks  associated  with  this  situation  can  be 
mitigated if components Z and B are placed within a 
secure system (so that there is no security gap while 
on  the  Internet,  for  example).  Another  means  of 
mitigating the risks associated with a security gap is 
to  provide  integrity  protection  on  information  (for 
example using a digital signatures). This will allow 
the back-end system (component B) to determine if 
the information has been modified by component Z 
while in the security gap.

Figure 8: Security “Gap” 
A WAP Gateway introduces an encryption “gap” 
since  the  WTLS  session  exists  only  between  the 
WAP  device  and  the  Gateway  (only  between 
components  A  and  Z  as  shown  in  Figure  8).  In  a 
secure  architecture,  an  SSL  session  will  then  be 
established between the Gateway and the back-end. 
One  way  to  mitigate  this  “problem”  is  to  place  a 
WAP Gateway within the premises of the Enterprise 
(see Section 2.2 for more details).  
The  WAP  Forum  has  adopted  the  Transport 
Layer E2E (end-to-end) Security Specification [12] 
to  address  this  issue.  The  Transport  Layer  E2E 
specification works as follows (see Figure 9): 
•  The  WAP  client  tries  to  send  a  request 
through  its  default  Gateway  to  a  secure 
domain. 
•  The  secure  content  server  determines  that 
the  request  must  arrive  through  the  WAP

Gateway in its domain and returns a HTTP 
redirect message. 
•  The default Gateway validates the redirect 
and transmits it to the client. 
•  The client then caches the new connection 
and  transmits  transactions  destined  for  the 
secure  domain  to  the  subordinate  WAP 
Gateway. 
•  After  the  connection  is  terminated  the 
default Gateway is re-selected.

The  WTLS  specification  is  sound  from  a 
security perspective. Unfortunately WTLS has been 
specified  to  be  optional  to  be  conformant  to  the 
WAP  standard.  As  a  result  many  current  WAP 
phones  do  not  support  WTLS,  thereby  relying  on 
underlying  communication  services  (e.g.  GSM 
security,  which  stops  at  the  RAS)  to  provide 
protection 
including  entity  authentication,  data 
integrity and data confidentiality.  
Most of the currently available implementations 
of  WTLS  in  mobile  devices  only  provide  Class  1 
security. This is insufficient for secure e-commerce

transactions  and  is  not  used  by  those  parties  who 
provide e-commerce transactions.  
WTLS  Class  2  conformant  WAP  devices  are 
currently  available  on  the  market.  Wireless  e-
commerce transactions rely on the security provided 
by server-side authentication and the ability to sign 
a  transaction.  Because  WTLS  Class  2  does  not 
allow  for  client-side  certificates,  non-repudiation 
based on signing is not possible. Currently, those e-
commerce  services  provided  with  WTLS  Class  2 
service do not allow “out-of-economy” transactions, 
such as bill paying or transfers to another account.  
The “best” security provided by WAP requires 
WTLS  Class  3.  It  is  anticipated  that  WAP  devices 
supporting  WTLS  Class  3  will  be  generally 
available  around  the  end-of-year  2001.  Several 
phone  manufacturers,  such  as  Motorola  and  Nokia 
have  announced  trial  implementations  based  on 
limited-run,  special  production,  WTLS  Class  3 
conformant  devices.  Limited  production  runs  of 
WTLS  Class  3  phones  have  been  introduced;  they 
are  not  yet  generally  available  to  the  mass-market. 
When  this  class  of  WAP  device  is  available,  it  is 
anticipated  that  many  banking  institutions  will 
enhance  their  current  wireless  e-commerce  service 
offerings to allow for “out-of-economy” services.  
iMode 
security 
is  based  on 
same 
“principles”  as  Internet  security  (provided  by 
SSL/TLS). Current iMode implementation provide a 
server-side  authenticated  SSL  session.  Current 
iMode  security  is  equivalent  to  security  offered  in 
the current wired environment.  
iMode, 
Although  DoCoMo  has  claimed 
the 
introduction  of  client-side  certificates  is  part  of 
future  work  for 
there  have  been  no 
indications of when this capability will be available. 
WAP suffers from the “security gap” problem. 
The WTLS protocol for WAP is broken at the WAP 
Gateway.  As  the  WAP  Gateway  can  be  placed 
within  the  control  of  the  Enterprise,  the  risks 
introduced by this gap can be mitigated. 
Within the Internet world, certificates and keys 
can  have  different  “strengths”,  depending  on  how 
they  were  generated.  Non-repudiation  and  digital 
signatures  require  users  to  download  and  install  a 
browser plug-in or Java applet. Key and certificate 
strength  equivalent  to  that  implemented  with  the 
WAP specification requires a smart card reader and 
smart card.

7  Conclusion 
The security that can be achieved for WAP or 
iMode enabled transactions is in our opinion at least 
equal  to  the  one  that  can  be  achieved  in  current 
Internet browser based transactions.  
Furthermore  WAP  seems  to  be  a  step  ahead 
with  regards  to  specifications,  using  the  public-
private key pairs hardcoded on the WIM, the ease-
of-use  of  client-side  certificates  and  the  built-in 
Crypto.signText 
function.  All  client-side 
public-private  key  pairs  are  generated  in  a  known, 
secure  manner.  Through  the  adoption  of  the  WIM 
module it is possible to achieve a more reliable form 
of  authentication  (public  key  and  smart  card). 
Because 
the  process  of  key  and  certificate 
generation is controlled and known, WAP can claim 
non-repudiation at a level not generally possible in 
the Internet world. 
Whether WAP or iMode will be a great success 
or  not  therefore  should  not  depend  on  security 
issues.  The  remaining  issues  such  as  usability  and 
openness should determine in how far WAP and/or 
iMode can be globally adopted [16].
