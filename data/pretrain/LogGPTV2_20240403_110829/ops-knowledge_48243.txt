User: Looking to do a very small, quick 'n dirty side project. I like the fact that the Google App Engine is running on Python with Django built right in - gives me an excuse to try that platform... but my question is this:
Has anyone made use of the app engine for anything other than a toy problem? I see some good example apps out there, so I would assume this is good enough for the real deal, but wanted to get some feedback.
Any other success/failure notes would be great.
Assistant: This question has been fully answered. Which is good. 
But one thing perhaps is worth mentioning.
The google app engine has a plugin for the eclipse ide which is a joy to work with. 
If you already do your development with eclipse you are going to be so happy about that. 
To deploy on the google app engine's web site all I need to do is click one little button - with the airplane logo - super.
