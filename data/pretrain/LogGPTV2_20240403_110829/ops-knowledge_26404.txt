### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:10:26 to 18:10:32 on October 18th, highlights several recurring issues in a Hadoop environment. The primary components involved are the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and the `LeaseRenewer`.

#### Key Observations:

1. **RMCommunicator Allocator Issues:**
   - **Error in Contacting RM:**
     - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` (part of `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`) is repeatedly failing to contact the Resource Manager (RM) at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
     - This error occurs multiple times, specifically at 18:10:26, 18:10:28, 18:10:30, and 18:10:32.
     - The allocator is attempting to reconnect with a retry policy that allows up to 10 retries with a 1-second interval between each attempt.

2. **LeaseRenewer Issues:**
   - **Lease Renewal Failures:**
     - The `LeaseRenewer` (part of `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`) is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
     - The lease renewal failure is reported every second, with the duration of the failure increasing by one second each time (e.g., 329 seconds at 18:10:27, 330 seconds at 18:10:28, and so on).
     - The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

3. **Address Change Detection:**
   - Both the `RMCommunicator Allocator` and the `LeaseRenewer` detect an address change for the server `msra-sa-41`.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:port`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:port`.
   - This address change is detected for both ports 9000 and 8030, and it occurs multiple times throughout the log.

### Detailed Breakdown:

- **Timestamps and Components:**
  - **18:10:26:** `RMCommunicator Allocator` reports an error in contacting the RM.
  - **18:10:27:** `LeaseRenewer` detects an address change and fails to renew the lease.
  - **18:10:28:** `RMCommunicator Allocator` detects an address change and attempts to reconnect, but fails again.
  - **18:10:29:** `LeaseRenewer` continues to fail in renewing the lease.
  - **18:10:30:** `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to reconnect and fails again.
  - **18:10:31:** `LeaseRenewer` continues to fail in renewing the lease.
  - **18:10:32:** `RMCommunicator Allocator` attempts to reconnect and fails again, and `LeaseRenewer` continues to fail in renewing the lease.

### Conclusion:

The log indicates a persistent issue with the `RMCommunicator Allocator` failing to contact the RM and the `LeaseRenewer` failing to renew the lease for a specific DFS client. The address changes detected by both components suggest a possible network or configuration issue that is causing the connectivity problems. The system is set up to retry these operations, but the repeated failures indicate a need for further investigation and resolution.
