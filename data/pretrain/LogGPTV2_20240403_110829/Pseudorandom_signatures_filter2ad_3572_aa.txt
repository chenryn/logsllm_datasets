Abstract. We develop a three-level hierarchy of privacy notions for (unforgeable) digital signature
schemes. We ﬁrst prove mutual independence of existing notions of anonymity and conﬁdentiality,
and then show that these are implied by higher privacy goals. The top notion in our hierarchy is
pseudorandomness: signatures with this property hide the entire information about the signing process
and cannot be recognized as signatures when transmitted over a public network. This implies very
strong unlinkability guarantees across diﬀerent signers and even diﬀerent signing algorithms, and gives
rise to new forms of private public-key authentication.
We show that one way towards pseudorandom signatures leads over our mid-level notion, called in-
distinguishability: such signatures can be simulated using only the public parameters of the scheme.
As we reveal, indistinguishable signatures exist in diﬀerent cryptographic settings (e.g. based on RSA,
discrete logarithms, pairings) and can be eﬃciently lifted to pseudorandomness deploying general trans-
formations using appropriate encoding techniques. We also examine a more direct way for obtaining
pseudorandomness for any unforgeable signature scheme. All our transformations work in the standard
model. We keep public veriﬁability of signatures in the setting of system-wide known public keys. Some
results even hold if signing keys are disclosed to the adversary — given that signed messages have high
entropy.
1 Introduction
A digital signature σ on a message m is generated using a private key sk and is veriﬁed in respect to the
corresponding public key pk. Digital signatures shall be unforgeable and oﬀer authenticity of signers and
integrity of signed messages. In the 90’s, however, with the advent of public key infrastructures (PKIs), digital
signatures were criticized for being a threat to user’s privacy [19]. For instance, with system-wide known
(PKI-certiﬁed) public keys, and due to the public veriﬁability of signatures, any transmission of (m, σ) over a
public network such as the Internet implicitly reveals to all intermediate parties the identity of the signer, i.e.
owner of (certiﬁed) pk — and not only to the intended recipients/veriﬁers. Considering public availability of
both σ and pk, we can hope to obtain privacy only by restricting the amount of publicly available information
about message m. Indeed, messages might be delivered through a diﬀerent communication channel (e.g. in
an online banking scenario with two-factor authentication) or at some earlier or later point in time (e.g.
in anonymous auctions), and thus still remain out of reach of the adversary that obtains signatures and
public keys. Further on, veriﬁers might expect signatures on messages that need not be transmitted at all:
for example, private outputs computed with secure multi-party computation techniques or in (anonymous)
key exchange protocols can be viewed as messages for which parties may wish to exchange signatures.

Current Privacy Notions and Open Issues. Privacy of digital signatures, where signatures σ are
revealed but associated messages m are not disclosed, has found attention in deﬁnitions and security models
of anonymous signatures by Yang et al. [28] and Fischlin [17], and in the notion of conﬁdential signatures
by Dent et al. [16]. These schemes aim at either hiding the identities/public keys of signers (anonymity)
or the content of signed messages (conﬁdentiality). Both privacy notions were deﬁned for high-entropy
message spaces, which is a necessary requirement, presuming the system-wide knowledge of public keys and
signatures. This conceptual similarity raises a question on the possible relationship between anonymity and
conﬁdentiality, and triggers interest in a deeper study on the limits of privacy achievable with traditional
signature schemes: Are there schemes whose signatures σ hide signer’s identity/public key and simultaneously
keep signed messages secret? What are the diﬀerences between deterministic and probabilistic schemes in
terms of these goals? Is the property of ‘message recovery’ damaging for privacy? Answers to these questions
would clarify the relationship among the existing notions of privacy for signature schemes, shed light on their
privacy-enabling properties, and possibly pave the way for more sophisticated privacy guarantees. We give
answers to many such questions.
Pseudorandom Signatures and Applications. In fact, the most interesting question in respect to
privacy of signature schemes is whether signatures can look (to observers) completely random. On the one
hand, this property would repel attention of intermediate parties, possibly performing traﬃc analysis, to the
transmission of signatures. Those parties could not learn whether a given datagram represents something
potentially valuable (in this case a signature) or not. On the other hand, and more importantly, signatures
that cannot be distinguished from random strings (of some ﬁxed length) also hide which signing algorithm
its signer was using — this knowledge alone is often suﬃcient to identify signers (even if the signature scheme
itself is anonymous).
We give some examples where signers, or groups of signers, naturally use diﬀerent parameters settings
for (potentially) the same signing algorithm.
For instance, in the new European travel documents, the selection of speciﬁc (elliptic curve) parameters
is the priority of respective states [9]. Many banks and health insurance companies issue smart cards to
their customers, initialized with diﬀerent signing algorithms and parameters. We observe that distinguishing
among diﬀerent settings, implementations, or instantiations of the same signature scheme S can be seen as
a privacy problem, e.g. if signatures can be used to derive which citizenship or which customer relationship
to which bank or insurance company the signer has. Now assume that diﬀerent signature schemes S1, S2,
. . . (unforgeable, possibly under diﬀerent hardness assumptions or with varying levels of security) output
signatures σ1, σ2, . . ., respectively, of ﬁxed length L. If all these signatures looked random to observers,
then σi would hide the applied scheme Si, i.e. only the possession of m and (the expected signer’s) pk would
allow to verify σi. In contrast, any other party (even with knowledge of the keys of the whole system) would
remain totally clueless whether σi represents a signature or not, and, if so, which signing algorithm was used.
Furthermore, pseudorandom signatures give rise to covert public-key authentication, oﬀering crypto-
graphic protection to covert channels, i.e. channels that appear random to any entity other than the com-
munication partner (as deﬁned, e.g. in [10, 20, 27]). With pseudorandom signatures, it would be possible
to perform public-key authentication and execute authenticated key exchange over covert channels with-
out loosing covertness. For example, parties could ﬁrst run an unauthenticated key exchange protocol that
has random-looking messages (those can easily be constructed using the Diﬃe-Hellman approach in various
groups based on techniques used in our work (cf. Lemma 13)) and then exchange pseudorandom signatures on
the protocol transcript and an additional high-entropy conﬁrmation token derived from the established shared
key material. Since all exchanged messages are random-looking, the established secure channel between the
two mutually authenticated parties would remain covert. Moreover, if pseudorandomness of signatures can
be preserved even in the unfortunate case where the signing key sk is leaked, then the above protocol would
guarantee ‘forward covertness’ (akin to forward secrecy, e.g. [13]). More generally, pseudorandom signatures
seem to oﬀer very strong and useful privacy guarantees in communication protocols and applications where
authentication should remain unobservable by traﬃc analysis [22].

1.1 Our Results and Techniques
Privacy Hierarchy for Digital Signatures. We develop a three-level hierarchy of privacy notions for
digital signatures, starting our work with the investigation of the relationship between anonymity and con-
ﬁdentiality, two previously established privacy notions for signatures. Deﬁnitions of anonymity were ﬁrst
given by Yang et al. [28], with later reﬁnements by Fischlin [17]. These deﬁnitions presume messages with
high entropy (unlike Bellare and Duan [2] and Saraswat and Yun [24], who regard a more restrictive form
of signatures5). For conﬁdentiality, we use the original deﬁnitions by Dent et al. [16] (in its strongest vari-
ant). We show that anonymous signatures and conﬁdential signatures are independent privacy notions6. For
this reason, anonymity (ANON) and conﬁdentiality (CONF) are located at the lowest level of our privacy
hierarchy.
At the mid-level of our hierarchy we have indistinguishability (IND), expressing that signatures can be
simulated from the public parameters of the scheme. We prove that such signatures oﬀer stronger privacy
guarantees than purely anonymous and purely conﬁdential schemes. In particular, any transmission of an IND
signature simultaneously hides both the signer and the associated message. The IND property is thus a
generalization of both ANON and CONF and is suﬃcient for obtaining privacy in anticipated applications of
both schemes. IND signatures may, however, leak some recognizable structure about the signature scheme in
use.
The strongest privacy notion in our arsenal lets signatures appear to privacy adversaries as (structureless)
strings of random bits, and is hence termed pseudorandom (PR). We show why this property is suﬃcient to
hide all information about the signing process, including the signature scheme itself. The introduced privacy
hierarchy with the intuitively strongest notion of pseudorandomness on top is thus likely to close the subject
of privacy-preserving signatures.
Each of our privacy notions is deﬁned in two variants, reﬂecting that adversaries might of might not have
a copy of the signing key. That is, we also address security with full key exposure (FKE), which has been
formalized for anonymous schemes by Fischlin [17] (and is also considered in [2, 24], but did not ﬁnd formal
treatment in the deﬁnitions of conﬁdentiality in [16]). In our privacy hierarchy, we further distinguish between
probabilistic and deterministic schemes. Within other, we show that with full key exposure, obtaining any
form of privacy for deterministic schemes is hopeless.
The universe of privacy notions considered in this paper and their relationships is illustrated in Figure 1.
5 Anonymity deﬁnitions in [2, 24] assume that σ consists of two parts — signature σ1 and a value σ2 (called de-
anonymizer in [2] or veriﬁcation token in [24]), both of which are needed to perform the veriﬁcation. Transmission
of the entire σ = (σ1, σ2), that is amenable to veriﬁcation, becomes a two-stage process, with σ1 (together with m)
being disclosed in the ﬁrst stage, and σ2 in the second stage. Anonymity of the signer is then deﬁned with respect
to an adversary that knows σ1 but not σ2. As discussed in [2, 24], this deﬁnition essentially implies anonymity
from [17, 28], allowing also low-entropy message spaces. Since we look on privacy from a more general perspective
(e.g. consider conﬁdentiality as another privacy goal), it appears more advisable to work with high-entropy messages
and use conceptually simpler anonymity deﬁnitions from [17, 28].
6 Interestingly, Dent et al. [16] mention similarities between the notions but do not formally investigate their relation-
ship. They only expect it to be similar to the relationship between anonymous (key-private) encryption schemes [1]
and traditional public-key encryption schemes. Arguably, these notions do not seem to be independent, unless
anonymous encryption schemes that do not oﬀer secrecy of encrypted messages are interesting on their own.

Constructions and Transformations. For a selection of existing signature schemes, we investigate indis-
tinguishability and pseudorandomness properties and, where appropriate, propose modiﬁcations and generic
transformations to achieve these goals. We build privacy-preserving signatures in three diﬀerent crypto-
graphic settings, namely using RSA parameters on the example of the full-domain hash RSA (FDH-RSA)
scheme [4], using cyclic prime-order groups on the example of Schnorr’s scheme [25], and using pairings on
the example of the Boneh-Boyen (BB) scheme [5]. These results are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in
the following.
Indistinguishable Signatures. We formalize the notion of information recovering signatures (as a generaliza-
tion of the known concept of ‘message recovery’) and discuss its negative impact on conﬁdentiality, and hence
on indistinguishability and pseudorandomness. We show that not only known message recovering schemes
(e.g. ‘text-book’ RSA and Nyberg-Rueppel [21], together with their ‘hash-then-sign’-based transformations),
but also several other schemes (in diﬀerent cryptographic contexts) fall under our more general notion of
‘information recovery’ and thus do not oﬀer indistinguishability. Examples include schemes by Cramer and
Shoup (CS) [15], Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CL) [11], and Boneh, Lynn, and Shacham (BLS) [7]. That is,
signatures in these schemes leak information even if they do not allow full recovery of signed messages.
We then focus on three cryptographic settings — RSA, discrete logarithms (DL), and pairings — and
provide examples of indistinguishable schemes. In particular, we show that, using appropriate randomization
and padding techniques, FDH-RSA becomes indistinguishable. In DL setting we prove that the (generalized)
signature scheme by Schnorr [25] oﬀers indistinguishability ‘oﬀ the shelf’, yet assuming that its cyclic group
is shared among all signers. We notice that anonymity of FDH-RSA and Schnorr’s schemes was previously
analyzed in [28], their conﬁdentiality in [16]. Our analysis essentially shows that both schemes admit much
stronger privacy guarantees. Finally, we prove that the pairing-based Boneh-Boyen (BB) [5] scheme is indis-
tinguishable in the standard model, yet for uniformly distributed (ﬁxed-length) messages only. As suggested
in [5], the ‘hash-then-sign’ approach can be used in standard model to sign longer messages. We show that
in the random oracle model this method readily oﬀers indistinguishability for arbitrary long high-entropy
messages. We note that indistinguishability of all analyzed schemes holds in the presence of full key exposure
(FKE). Bottom line, we show existence of IND schemes in diﬀerent cryptographic settings, paving the way
towards pseudorandom signature schemes (based on diﬀerent hardness assumptions).
Pseudorandom Signatures. PR signatures, which cannot be distinguished from random bit strings of the
same length, oﬀer the highest form of privacy that signatures can provide.
Our ﬁrst result on PR signatures is a generic transformation that strengthens IND signatures to obtain
the PR property (we call it IND-to-PR compiler in Table 1). It uses admissible encodings, introduced in a
diﬀerent context by Boneh and Franklin [6] for elliptic curves, generalized later by Brier et al. [8], and also
used to preserve privacy in the password-based authentication protocol by Bringer, Chabanne and Icart [9]
(we thus show another interesting application of this primitive). By ﬁnding appropriate admissible encodings
for diﬀerent types of sets, we can immediately obtain the PR property for the IND versions of FDH-RSA,
Schnorr, and BB schemes. We also prove that the obtained PR property holds in the presence of full key
exposure.
Our next result is a second generic transformation that achieves the PR property directly for any (un-
forgeable) digital signature scheme. This PR compiler is powerful enough to guarantee the PR property also
for information recovering schemes and works irrespective of whether the original scheme is probabilistic
