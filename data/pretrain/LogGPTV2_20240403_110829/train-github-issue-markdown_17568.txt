Hi,
Would you be interested in getting rid of Pixel measurements and taking a more
flexible approach, using EM?
For things like, for example Legend size, paddings for headings, alert blocks,
buttons nav tabs. These things are more likely to be relative than absolute.
Also, sizes of input controls, sizes or labels and many more things. All of
them rely heavily on the base font size, and it will such an improvement to
have all those things in a relative measurements (em) rather than absolute
(px).
