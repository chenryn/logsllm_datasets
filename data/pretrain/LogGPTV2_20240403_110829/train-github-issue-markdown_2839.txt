### Which version of Sharding-Sphere do you using?
sharding-jdbc 3.0.0.M1
### Expected behavior
shardingConditions.getShardingConditions() should only one
### Actual behavior
I get multiple of the same conditions
### Steps to reproduce the behavior
sql:select * from table1 where shardingcolumn = *** and ( field1='test' or
field2 ='test' )
Only one shardingCondition is met, but
shardingConditions.getShardingConditions() contains multiple identical
conditions  
The final routing result is correct, however
ComplexKeysShardingAlgorithm.doSharding() is executed multiple times
