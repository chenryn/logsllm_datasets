on the oscilloscope is shown in Fig. 7(b), where the red
waveform (top, 2.5 V/div) is the excitation signal and the blue
one (bottom, 50 V/div) is the injected CM interference. This
experiment conﬁrmed that a CM interference can be converted
into a DM interference and added to the excitation signal.
Validation on smartphone touchscreen. We validated the
attack by displaying the capacitance variations across the entire
touchscreen of a Xiaomi Mi MIX2. The contour maps of the
capacitance variations are collected by the Android Debug
Bridge (ADB) tool [45]. As shown in Fig. 8,
in an idle
case without any touches, the capacitance variations of the
touchscreen shown in Fig. 8(a) have low magnitudes and
distributes evenly. In the case of human touches using ﬁve
ﬁngers, the capacitance variations on the locations with ﬁnger
contacts have much higher values than the rest ones, indicating
the touch events, as shown in Fig. 8(b). In the attack cases,
after we injected a CM signal with a frequency of 309 kHz and
RMS voltage of 113.1 V into the GND line, the capacitance
variations are changed compared to the ones in the idle case,
as shown in Fig. 8(c), indicating that the CM signal indeed
produces a DM signal that inﬂuences the excitation signal
and changes the measured capacitance. Although the DM
signal can result in capacitance variation, the changes shall
be controllable to deduce desired touch events.
V. ATTACK DESIGN
After clarifying how to inject a CM signal to reshape the
desired excitation signal for the sensing circuit of touchscreens
in Sec. IV, we introduce how to achieve effective attacks
against touchscreens. We design and achieve three kinds of

attacks, i.e., the injection attack, the alteration attack, and the
DoS attack. As the alteration attack and the DoS attack are
based on the injection attack, we elaborate on the design of the
injection attack from the signal enhancement, synchronization,
and touch event generation. The design mechanism of the
injection attack can be applied to the other two attacks.
A. Injection Attack
The key insight of WIGHT is to disturb the capacitance
measurement process by changing its excitation signal in order
to inject ghost touches. In mainstream touchscreens, a TX elec-
trode sends an excitation signal, and all RX electrodes transfer
the accumulated charge simultaneously [2], as is discussed in
Sec. II, so the injection attack achieves ghost touches along
intended TX electrodes. To achieve a successful
injection
attack, we need to address two key challenges: (a) How to
increase the injection intensity to create signiﬁcant capacitance
variation that can exceed the detection threshold for generating
ghost touches? (b) How to design the attack signal, including
its timing, duration, etc., to generate controllable touch events?
In the following, we introduce the key modules of the injection
attack, i.e., signal enhancement, signal synchronization, and
touch event generation, as shown in Fig. 9.
1) Signal Enhancement: The design of the attack signal
should ﬁrst consider the signal frequency, type, and its RMS
voltage to increase the injection intensity.
Signal Frequency: The CM-DM conversion strategy only
changes the magnitude and phase delay of the CM signal,
without changing the signal frequency. The frequency of the
DM attack signal, therefore, should match that of the original
excitation signal.

Fig. 11. The impact of signal frequency and magnitude on
capacitance variation of touchscreens.
Signal Type: As shown in Fig. 10, the original excitation
signal (black waveform) is a square-wave signal, and the ideal
DM attack signal will be a square-wave signal. However,
because the square-wave signal will be ﬁltered by the PMIC
module, we use the sin-wave signal as the candidate DM
attack signal instead. One question is whether the sin-wave
DM signal is strong enough to inﬂuence the excitation signal?
To analyze, we evaluate the accumulated charge Qm:
Qm = 2Cm(Vex + Vdm)
(12)
Vdm is the magnitude of the DM signal. The larger accumu-
lated charge Qm is, the stronger interference intensity can be.
To achieve maximum interference, the frequency fd and the
initial phase ϕd0 of the attack signal should be: fd = 1/Tte,
and ϕd0 = 0 or π.
To validate, we conducted a proof-of-concept experiment
on Xiaomi Mi Mix2 to verify our analysis. We injected a CM
signal with the RMS voltage of 102.5 V and frequencies in the
range of 200 kHz to 400 kHz, and then recorded the average
capacitance variation per 10 kHz. According to the correlation
curve of the signal frequency and the capacitance variation
(shown in Fig. 11(a)), the signal with the frequency of 310 kHz
demonstrates the largest interference intensity, which is close
to the frequency of the excitation signal, i.e., fex = 323kHz.
RMS Voltage: According to Eq. (12), the transferred charge
is approximately proportional to the signal intensity. To vali-
date, we performed a validation experiment by injecting CM
signals with the frequency of 310 kHz and RMS voltages
from 35.35 V to 106 V and then recorded the average ca-
pacitance variation per RMS voltage of 3.5 V. The correlation
curve of signal magnitude and capacitance variation (shown
in Fig. 11(b)) demonstrates proportionality. In practice, the
selection of RMS voltage should consider the power limitation
and safety issues.
2) Signal Synchronization: To create controllable ghost
touches, the attacker was to synchronize the DM attack signal
with the touchscreen scanning cycle. We introduce the active

and passive synchronization strategies.
Active Synchronization: To improve the energy efﬁciency
of touchscreens, modern smartphones use adaptive touch
sampling frequency scaling algorithm [46], [47]. Speciﬁcally,
when no touch is detected, the touchscreen will be in “green
mode” [48], [49], [50], [44] during which the touch refresh rate
is low. For example, the Apple iPhone SE smartphone sets its
touch refresh rate to 0.7 Hz in the green mode (Fig. 21(a)).
Once a touch is detected,
the touchscreen is switched to
“normal mode” with a normal refresh rate, e.g., 60 Hz for
the Apple iPhone SE smartphone (Fig. 21(b)).
In addition to a genuine touch, the normal mode can be
activated by an intentional EMI interference signal [50], [44].
WIGHT utilizes the adaptive touch sampling mechanism and
crafts an EMI activation signal that simulates the characteris-
tics of users’ touch to awaken the touchscreen from the green
mode. As a result, the DM signal following the malicious ac-
tivation signal can be synchronized with the excitation signal.
The active synchronization mechanism is depicted in Fig. 12,
where the orange signal is the EMI activation signal, the red
signal is the DM attack signal, and the blue signal is the
excitation signal. In our implementation, the EMI activation
signal is a sine-wave signal with a frequency of 20 kHz and
an RMS voltage of 70 V.
Passive Synchronization: The activation mechanism ac-
tively synchronizes the DM attack signal with the excitation
signal. In addition, we propose a passive synchronization
strategy to measure the excitation signal scanning cycle.
(a) Measuring excitation signal: Excitation signals of touch-
screens are AC signals with high frequencies, e.g., 100 kHz
to 500 kHz [25], [18], which can be unintentionally leaked in
the form of conducted or radiated EMI [8], [51]. Therefore,
the attacker can passively receive the leaked EMI signal to
extract the timing information. To validate the feasibility, we
measured the conducted EMI signal in the GND line through
the USB port and collected the radiated EMI signal via an
antenna that is above the touchscreen of the Xiaomi Mi Mix2
smartphone. The left ﬁgure of Fig. 13 shows the excitation
signal trace output from an oscilloscope, in which the bottom
waveform is the conducted EMI signal and the top one is the
radiated EMI signal, and both of them reﬂect the excitation

The results validate our design and show that

The average deviations of Xiaomi Mi MIX2 and LG Nexus
5X are 21.8 pixels and 52.9 pixels, respectively, which are
smaller than the buttons’ sizes (169.2*429.1, 186.6*446.3).
Some devices whose TXs are excited partially simultane-
ously (i.e., the half-sequential driving method) or simulta-
neously (i.e., the parallel driving method) [24], [23], [21].
For those devices, we can still inject ghost touches according
to the timing information but with limited control over the
touches’ positions. In this paper, injection attacks will have
three different outcomes according to the driving methods.
(1) Type I: For smartphones adopting the sequential driving
method, the attacker can specify any TXs as targets for ghost
touches. (2) Type II: For smartphones adopting the half-
sequential driving method, the attacker can specify the TXs of
limited areas to which ghost touches are injected. (3) Type III:
For smartphones adopting the parallel driving method, ghost
touches can only appear at certain positions.
B. Alteration Attack
The injection attack works when a victim is not using the
smartphone. When a victim is playing with his smartphone,
WIGHT can achieve an alteration attack to change the locations
of the user’s touchpoints by inﬂuencing the RX. Compared
to the injection attack, we use the same method whereby the
accumulated charge is changed and the output voltage exceeds

signal of the touchscreen. Compared to the measurement of
the radiated EMI signal, the measurement at the USB GND
port can deduce a more clear signal trace for synchronization.
(b) Extracting timing information: To extract timing infor-
mation from the measured EMI signal, we utilized a DAQ
tool [52] to process the signal trace. Then the trace is smoothed
by ﬁltering out the power-frequency (i.e., 50 Hz) noise and
higher-frequency noises. The right ﬁgure of Fig. 13 shows the
process of extracting the timing information. we ﬁltered the
measured EMI signal (top waveform) and extracted the timing
information (bottom) from the ﬁltered signal (middle).

3) Touch Event Generation: To generate controllable touch
events, we introduce a synchronization mechanism. The key
factors to make a successful
include attack
execution time and distribution range of the desired ghost
touches. Fig. 14 shows the excitation signal (top), the timing
information (middle), and the attack signal (bottom). First of
all, the attacker calculates the transmission delay Tde, the
interval between the moments when the scan starts and when
the targeted TX is scanned:
Tde = m(Ttx + Tin)
(13)
where m is the number of TXs before scanning the ﬁrst TXs
below the button. As shown in Fig. 14, there is only one TX
before scanning the target button, so m = 1. Next, the attacker
estimates the transmission duration Tdu of the attack signal:
Tdu = n(Ttx + Tin)
(14)
where n is the number of TX electrodes that are covered
by a desired ghost touch area, i.e., the button in Fig. 14.
To validate the design, we chose attack signals with the
transmission duration of 0.5, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 3.5 ms, and
recorded the pixel range of TXs covered by ghost touches on
two smartphones (Xiaomi Mi MIX2, LG Nexus 5X). Fig. 15
presents the theoretical TXs range Rtheo (dashed lines) and
the average range of the ghost touches Rexp (solid lines) in 3
repeated experiments with various transmission durations. In
addition, the deviation D of ghost touches can be given as:
D = Rexp − Rtheo

frequencies. The 320 kHz shows a low success rate, indicating
that the attack signals should have a different frequency from
that of the excitation signal for a better DoS effect.
the detection threshold, but the alteration attack requires the
noise signal with smaller magnitudes and slightly different
frequencies. In addition, the DM signal in the alteration attack
is caused by the users’ contact instead of the asymmetric
circuits.
When a user touches the touchscreen,
the capacitance
changes by the touch can be regarded as a parasitic capacitor,
which forms a closed loop with the RX electrode [7]. When we
inject a CM noise, it will be converted into a DM noise via the
closed loop and then change the accumulated charge Qm of
the RX electrode and further change the voltage output. Once
the output exceeds the detection threshold, ghost touches will
be detected on the crosspoints of TXs and RXs. Noted that
the alteration attack does not require synchronization with the
excitation signal and the ghost touches do not appear until the
victim touches. Thus, the CM noise should be injected before
the victim touches the screen, and it takes several hundreds
of milliseconds for a human to touch a button while it takes
only a few milliseconds for the touch controller to scan the
screen. Once the user touches the screen, the ghost touches
can appear on any position along the entire RX. As a result,
the attacker can use the alteration attack to change what the
users have chosen, e.g., clicking “No” but actually “Yes” is
clicked.
C. DoS Attack
In addition to actively injecting ghost
touches, WIGHT
attack can also force to disable the touch service, i.e., the
touchscreen does not respond to any user’s touch operations.
Typically, when there is an electrostatic discharge (ESD)
on the device [53], [14], smartphones will stop reporting
the touch events for bypassing accidental touches and self-
protection [54], [55], [56]. To simulate the ESD-induced soft
failures, the attacker can create an external interference as ESD
or EMI [13] by injecting a CM signal to smartphones via the
GND line. To avoid generating unexpected ghost touches, it is
suggested that the attacker should avoid using the frequency
of the excitation signal introduced in Sec. V-A. We conducted
experiments on Xiaomi Mi MIX2. If the smartphone does not
generate any touchpoints when we touch the screen, we regard
it as a successful attack. We swept the attack signal with an
RMS voltage of 70.7 V from 10 kHz to 500 kHz with a step
size of 20 kHz and recorded the success rate in 10 repeated
experiments. The results (shown in Fig. 16) indicate that the
