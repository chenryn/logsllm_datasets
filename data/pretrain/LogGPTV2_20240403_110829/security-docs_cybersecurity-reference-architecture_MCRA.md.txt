# Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA)

The Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA) are a key component of the [Microsoft Security Adoption Framework (SAF)](/security/ciso-workshop/adoption). These reference architectures provide a comprehensive overview of Microsoft's cybersecurity capabilities and technologies, detailing how they integrate with various Microsoft and third-party platforms. The MCRA covers:

- Microsoft 365
- Microsoft Azure
- Third-party applications such as ServiceNow and Salesforce
- Third-party cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- First and third-party AI capabilities

## What Does the MCRA Include?

The MCRA provides essential information on:

- **Antipatterns and Best Practices**: Common mistakes to avoid and recommended practices.
- **Guiding Rulesets**: End-to-end architectural guidelines.
- **Threat Trends and Attack Patterns**: Insights into current and emerging threats.
- **Mapping Microsoft Capabilities**: Aligning Microsoft's security features with organizational roles and Zero Trust standards.
- **Securing Privileged Access**: Strategies for protecting high-privilege accounts.
- **Reference Plans in SAF**: Including examples such as modernizing patch management.
- **Prioritizing Using Attacker ROI**: Evaluating security measures based on potential attacker return on investment.

Additionally, the MCRA includes detailed technical diagrams for:

- **Microsoft Cybersecurity Capabilities**: Overview of Microsoft's security offerings.
- **Zero Trust User Access**: Implementing Zero Trust principles for user access.
- **Security Operations (SecOps/SOC)**: Enhancing security operations and incident response.
- **Operational Technology (OT)**: Securing industrial control systems and operational technology.
- **Multicloud and Cross-Platform Capabilities**: Integrating security across multiple cloud environments.
- **Attack Chain Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of attack vectors and mitigation strategies.
- **Infrastructure and Development Security**: Ensuring secure development and infrastructure practices.
- **Security Organizational Functions**: Aligning security functions with organizational needs.

## How to Use the MCRA

The MCRA is a versatile resource that can be used for various purposes, including:

- **Starting Template for a Security Architecture**: Many organizations use the MCRA to define a target state for their cybersecurity capabilities. It is particularly useful for enterprises with a mix of on-premises, mobile, multicloud, and IoT/OT environments.
- **Comparison Reference for Security Capabilities**: Organizations can compare Microsoft's recommendations with their existing security implementations. This often reveals that they already own and can leverage many of the recommended technologies.
- **Learning About Microsoft Capabilities**: The MCRA serves as an educational tool. In presentation mode, each capability includes a "ScreenTip" with a brief description and a link to more detailed documentation.
- **Understanding Integration Investments**: The architecture helps architects and technical teams identify integration points within Microsoft capabilities and with existing security solutions.
- **Educational Resource for Cybersecurity**: For those new to the field, the MCRA can be a valuable learning tool, providing foundational knowledge and practical insights.
