User:  Install and configure Nginx for a CentOS server and verify that it is working properly.
Assistant: Step 1: Install Nginx First, you need to install Nginx with the following command: sudo yum install nginx This command will install the latest version of Nginx. Step 2: Start Nginx Once Nginx is installed, you can use the following command to start Nginx: sudo systemctl start nginx To verify that Nginx has started successfully, run the following command: sudo systemctl status nginx In the output displayed on the console, you should see The status to Nginx is "active (running)". Step 3: Verify that Nginx is working properly To verify that Nginx is working properly, use your web browser to visit your server's IP address or domain name, for example: http://your_server_ip_address or http://your_domain_name if you have configured DNS For resolution, use the domain name. Otherwise, use your server IP address. If Nginx is working properly, you should see Nginx's default welcome page in your browser. This means that Nginx has been successfully installed and configured. Step 4: Configure Nginx To change the configuration of Nginx, you need to edit the configuration file of Nginx. By default, this file is located at the following path: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf You can use any text editor to open this file. Be sure to back up the original file before editing the configuration file. To make the changes take effect, please restart Nginx: sudo systemctl restart nginx The following parameters are used for modification: server_name is used to specify the domain name of the service; root is used to specify the directory address where the service is located; index: is used to specify the default home page file name for service access; location: It is used to specify the virtual path of the resource and the corresponding specific directory address. Step 5: Understand Nginx's logs Nginx generates a lot of logs. These logs include access logs and error logs. It is also possible to change their default location by editing Nginx's configuration file. Access log: Record the detailed information of each client request, such as request time, requested URL, HTTP return code, client IP and port, etc. By default, the access log is located in the following path: /var/log/nginx/access.log Error log: record Nginx error and exception information. By default, the error log is located at the following path: /var/log/nginx/error.log If you wish to find detailed information about a specific URL request, you can use the following command: sudo grep "URL" /var/log/nginx/access. log You should replace "URL" with the URL you are looking for. This command will output all records containing URLs. Step 6: Improve Nginx performance Nginx performance depends on many factors. While the default configuration may be fine for most websites, the following factors may help improve Nginx's performance: Static content caching: Nginx supports static content caching. Enabling this feature can improve the responsiveness of your site. Enable compression: Nginx supports enabling gzip compression, which compresses responses to optimize transmission. Use HTTP2 protocol: Nginx supports HTTP2 protocol. This protocol can improve website performance, responsiveness and bandwidth utilization. You can check if Nginx supports gzip compression and the HTTP2 protocol with the following command: curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -L http://your_server_ip_address This will link and display useful information about your server, including supported features . If "HTTP/2" is included in the output, your Nginx supports the HTTP2 protocol. Summary In this tutorial, we learned how to install and configure Nginx on CentOS, and verified that it was working properly. We also looked at how to edit Nginx configuration files, verify Nginx logs, and some factors that improve Nginx performance. These are the reasons that make Nginx a popular web server and reverse proxy.
