User: I quiet often launch python scripts from command-line, like python somescript.py --with-arguments
Now I'm wondering why that does not saved in output of history command?
And if there is a way to see history of it
Assistant: Bash usually saves all your commands in the history buffer except if you specifically mark them to be excluded.  There is an environment variable HISTIGNORE which might be configured to ignore python invocations altogether, although this is somewhat unlikely; or you may be marking them for exclusion by typing a space before the command.
