A Additional Preliminary Deﬁnitions and Lemmata
Deﬁnition A.1 (Coin Tossing). An ideal coin tossing is a functionality denoted with F coin that
interacts with two parties A and B, samples a uniform string r ∈ {0, 1}∗ and sends r to A and B.
Deﬁnition A.2 (Extractable Commitments). An extractable commitment scheme consists of three
algorithms.
com(x, r): Commits to x using randomness r.
open(com, x, r): Outputs 1 if commitment com ∈ com(x, r).
ext(com, aux): Given some auxiliary information, it extracts committed value x.
30
For security, we ask that it is hiding, i.e.
m, com(x, r) and that it is binding, i.e. for any x, ext(com(x, r)) outputs x.
for any x, m, x, com(x, r) is indistinguishable from
An extractable commitment can easily constructed using a random oracle by deﬁning com(x, r) :=
H(x, r), open simply evaluates H and checks equality and the ext algorithm observes the random
oracle queries from which x can be learned.
A.1 Key Agreement
We give the following additional security deﬁnition for key agreement protocols.
Deﬁnition A.3 (One-Round Uniform Key Agreement). We call a UKA one-round uniform key
agreement if the function mB ← B(tB, mA) does not depend on mA and can be computed solely using
input tB. More precisely, there is a function B(cid:48) such that for any mA, B(cid:48)(tB) = B(tB, mA), which
we will in the following refer to with B as well.
Deﬁnition A.4 (Multi-Instance Uniformity). We call a UKA Q-multi-instance -uniform if for
any ppt distinguisher D and any polynomial size auxiliary input z,
| Pr[DOA(z)] = 1] − P r[DOu(z) = 1]| ≤ ,
where OA outputs mA ← A(tA) for fresh randomness tA and Ou outputs u ← G and Q is a bound
on the amount of queries to Ou, OA.
Deﬁnition A.5 (Multi-Instance Key-Indistinguishability). We call a UKA (Q, n)-multi-instance
-key-indistinguishable if for any ppt distinguisher D and any polynomial size auxiliary input z,
| Pr[DO(cid:104)A,B(cid:105),Ok(z)] = 1] − P r[DO(cid:104)A,B(cid:105),Ou(z) = 1]| ≤ ,
where O(cid:104)A,B(cid:105) outputs on the i-th query a transcript Ti := (cid:104)Ai, Bi(cid:105), Ok outputs on query j, key
kj = Key(tA,j, mB,j) = Key(tB,j, mA,j) that matches transcript Ti. Ou outputs a uniform element u
from the key domain. O(cid:104)A,B(cid:105) uses fresh random tapes tA,i, tB,i ← {0, 1}∗ for every query. Q is a
bound on the amount of queries to O(cid:104)A,B(cid:105), where n bounds the amount of queries to Ok, Ou.
In case of a one-round UKA, we deﬁne a stronger version of the multi-instance key-indistinguishability,
which we call one-round multi-instance key-indistinguishability.
Deﬁnition A.6 (One-Round Multi-Instance Key-Indistinguishability). We call a one-round UKA
one-round (Q, n)-multi-instance -key-indistinguishability if for any ppt distinguisher D and any
polynomial size auxiliary input z,
| Pr[DOA,Ok(z, mB)] = 1] − P r[DOA,Ou(z, mB) = 1]| ≤ ,
where mB ← B(tB) for uniform tB. OA outputs on the i-th query mA,i ← A(tA,i) for uniform tA,i.
Ok outputs on query j, key kj = Key(tA,j, mB) = Key(tB, mA). Ou outputs a uniform element u
from the key domain. Q is a bound on the amount of queries to OA, where n bounds the amount
of queries to Ok, Ou.
In the next lemmata, we show that all the security notions are implied by the standard deﬁni-
tions, but potentially with a polynomial security loss.
Lemma A.7. Let UKA be -uniform, then it is Q-multi-instance Q-uniform.
31
Proof. This follows straightforwardly from using a simple hybrid argument. Hybrid hybi samples
mA,j for j ≤ i from Ou and for j > i from OA. If there is an adversary that distinguishes hybi
from hybi+1 for any i, then we can break the uniformity of UKA by distinguishing mA,i+1 from
uniform.
Lemma A.8. Let UKA be -key-indistinguishable, then it is (Q, n)-multi-instance Q-key-indistinguishable.
Proof. Again, we use a hybrid argument over hybrids hybi. In hybi, (mA,j, mB,j), kj is sampled from
O(cid:104)A,B(cid:105) ×Ou for j ≤ i and from O(cid:104)A,B(cid:105) ×Ok for j > i. If one distinguishes hybi from hybi+1 for some
i, one breaks the key-indistinguishability.
Lemma A.9. Let a one-round UKA be -key-indistinguishable, then it is one-round (Q, n)-multi-
instance Q-key-indistinguishable.
Proof. This lemma follows for the same reason as Lemma A.8.
A.2 Oblivious Transfer
Lemma A.10 (Repeat of Lemma 3.1). Let the distribution of OT strings be eﬃciently sampleable.
Then F U
OT-security.
OT-security implies F S
OT-security imply F E
OT as well as F R
OT-security. F S
OT or F R
Proof. In the ﬁrst step, we show that uniform message security implies sender chosen message
security and receiver chosen message security implies endemic security. These two implications
result from the same simple fact that a malicious sender interacting with the ideal OT is easier to
construct when it can choose the OT strings than when it receives the strings from the ideal OT.
The following claim formalizes this fact.
