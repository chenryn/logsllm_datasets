React version:  
17.0.2, previous versions too
## Steps To Reproduce
  1. Set an elements opacity to a value like 50%
  2. Deploy to production and it's changed to 1%
## The current behaviour
The opacity of an element gets set to 1% in production if the value in its CSS
rulesets is in percentage, Like 70%
## The expected behaviour
The opacity value should be 70% (for example)
Way to bypass this is to use decimals while setting opacity in CSS.
Like opacity: 0.7;  
Instead of opacity: 70%;
