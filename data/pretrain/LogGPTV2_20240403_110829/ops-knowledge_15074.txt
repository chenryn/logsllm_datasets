User: I have been learning a lot of python recently using sublime text on a mac, I installed python 3 and have mainly been using that but as a lot of documentation is in python 2.7 and it comes with the Mac I decided to start using 2.7 instead. I have quite a few libraries installed (for python 3 and for 2.7) When I load my terminal it takes a good 15 seconds for it to get to the prompt and it takes the same amount of time to build python 2.7 from sublime text before it starts executing the code.
I know this post is probably too vague but if anyone has had a similar experience or could suggest anything to point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.
Thanks.
Assistant: Run python -vvv to dump out imports Python is doing when it starts up. If the slowdown is by a third party library this should give a hint.
Check your ~/.bashrc script for duplicate entries (see comments below).
