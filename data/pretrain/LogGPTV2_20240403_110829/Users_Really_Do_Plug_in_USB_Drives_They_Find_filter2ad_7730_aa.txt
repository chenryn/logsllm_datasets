### Abstract
We investigate the anecdotal belief that end users will pick up and plug in USB flash drives they find by conducting a controlled experiment on a large university campus. We dropped 297 flash drives and found that the attack is highly effective, with an estimated success rate of 45–98%, and rapid, with the first drive connected within six minutes. We analyzed the types of drives users connected and surveyed those users to understand their motivations and security profiles. Our findings indicate that the appearance of the drive does not significantly influence the likelihood of connection; instead, users connect the drive with the intention of finding the owner. These individuals are not technically incompetent but are typical community members who appear to take more recreational risks than their peers. We conclude with lessons learned and discuss how social engineering attacks, while less technical, continue to be an effective threat vector that our community has yet to successfully address.

## I. Introduction
The security community has long held the belief that users can be socially engineered into picking up and plugging in seemingly lost USB flash drives. Whether driven by altruistic motives or human curiosity, the user unknowingly opens their organization to an internal attack when they connect the drive—a physical Trojan horse. Despite numerous anecdotes and pentesters' claims of success, there has been little formal analysis of the effectiveness of this attack or the reasons behind users' actions.

In this work, we investigate this classic anecdote by conducting a large-scale experiment on the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign campus. We dropped nearly 300 flash drives of different types, in different locations, and at different times. To measure the efficacy and speed of the attack, we replaced expected files on the drives with HTML files containing an embedded `img` tag that allows us to track when a file is opened without executing any code.

Our results show that users pick up and connect an estimated 45%–98% of the dropped drives. The median time to connection was 6.9 hours, with the first connection occurring within six minutes. Contrary to popular belief, the appearance of the drive did not increase the likelihood of connection. Instead, users connected all types of drives unless there were other means of locating the owner, suggesting altruistic motivation. However, nearly half of the users, after initially connecting the drive with altruistic intentions, opened intriguing files such as vacation photos before attempting to find the owner.

To better understand users' motivations and rationale, we offered participants the opportunity to complete a short survey. We asked about their reasons for connecting the drive, precautions taken, demographic information, and standard questions to measure their risk profile and computer expertise. We found that the attack was effective against all sub-populations at the university. Most respondents connected the drive to locate its owner (68%) or out of curiosity (18%), although some admitted they planned to keep the drive for themselves.

The students and staff who connected the drives were not technically or security illiterate and were not significantly different from their peers on the Egelman and Peer's Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS). While these users engaged in riskier behavior than their peers on the DOSPERT scale, they were more risk-averse than the general population in every domain except for recreational risk.

When prompted, 68% of users stated they took no precautions when connecting the drive. For those who considered protective measures, 10 (16%) scanned the drive with antivirus software, and 5 (8%) believed their operating system or security software would protect them. Surprisingly, another 5 (8%) sacrificed a personal computer or used university resources to protect their personal equipment. In the end, most users who took precautions did so ineffectively, and the majority took no precautions at all.

These results, particularly the risk averseness relative to the general population on the DOSPERT scale, suggest that the attack would be effective against most users and that the average person does not understand the danger of connecting an unknown peripheral to their computer. We hope that by bringing these details to light, we remind the security community that some of the simplest attacks remain realistic threats. There is still much work needed to understand the dynamics of social engineering, develop technical defenses, and learn how to effectively teach users to protect themselves.

## II. Related Work
Our work is based on anecdotal evidence that users will plug in USB flash drives they find [6]–[9] and prior work showing that simply connecting a USB drive presents an immediate risk.

### Removable Device Attacks
Microsoft Windows no longer automatically executes arbitrary code when connecting a USB drive, which defeats many traditional attacks [10]. However, connecting a USB drive still poses significant risk. In 2014, Nohl et al. demonstrated that an attacker can reprogram the firmware in a USB drive to convert it into a USB human interface device that automatically executes malicious code or into a network interface that intercepts sensitive traffic [13]. Similarly, file previews are automatically generated on connection, and vulnerabilities in installed applications can enable an attack. For example, in 2013, a vulnerability in SketchUp allowed code execution during file preview generation [14]. Larimer showed that similar attacks are possible on Linux [15], and work by Sevinsky [16] and Hudson [17] extended this attack beyond USB to Thunderbolt devices.

### USB Drive Engineering
Despite the widespread belief that users will plug in USB drives they find, there has been no peer-reviewed research on the topic. Jacobs informally investigated the question in his master's thesis and found that 11 out of 30 flash drives were opened in both commercial and residential areas [18]. More recently, CompTIA commissioned a study that dropped 200 flash drives containing text files with email addresses or trackable links in high-traffic public spaces in four cities. They also fielded a survey but did not survey participants who interacted with the flash drives [19]. We compare our results to both studies throughout the paper.

### Social Engineering Attacks
There have been several studies focusing broadly on social engineering. Researchers have used social networks to increase the effectiveness of phishing attacks [20]. Wright left 50 unsecured smartphones in cities to observe their finders' behaviors [21]. Christin et al. investigated the incentive necessary to convince users to run an unknown binary using Mechanical Turk [22]. Greitzer et al. defined the Unintentional Insider Threat problem, discussed case studies, and provided recommendations [23].

### Social Engineering Susceptibility
Several studies have aimed to determine the relationship between demographic factors and cybercrime victims [24]–[30]. Beyond specific attacks, there have been several studies measuring what factors affect security hygiene and user behavior [31]–[35].

### Decision Making
There has been extensive previous work on human decision-making processes. We build on this literature, using the DOSPERT scale [5], [36] to measure participants' risk-taking profile and the SeBIS survey [4] to measure security knowledge and behavior. Our work underscores existing literature on users' attitudes towards security [37]–[42], further suggesting that users can generally identify technology risks but do not necessarily understand them.

## III. Methodology
To determine whether users pick up and connect USB flash drives they find, we dropped 297 flash drives at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign—a large academic institution in the United States—and measured who connected the drives and why.

Each flash drive contained files named consistently with the drive's appearance, but were actually HTML files containing an `img` tag that referenced our centrally managed server and offered the user an opportunity to answer a survey about why they picked up the flash drive. We measured (1) whether users picked up the flash drives, (2) whether users later connected the drives and opened files, and (3) why users connected the flash drives. In this section, we describe our experiment in detail.

### A. Drive Selection and Placement
We wanted to measure not only whether users picked up flash drives but also whether external appearance affects users' behavior. In our experiment, we varied the (1) geographic drop location, (2) the physical appearance of the drive (e.g., using an external label), and (3) the time of day and measured their effect:

1. **Geographic Location**: We placed flash drives at 30 unique locations on the campus, ten at each of three sub-campuses (Main Quad, South Quad, and Engineering Quad). On each sub-campus, we placed drives at five location types: parking lots, hallways, academic areas (e.g., classrooms or libraries), common areas (e.g., building lobbies or cafeterias), and outside (e.g., sidewalks). We distributed the experiment among the three sub-campuses to reduce the chance of arousing suspicion.

2. **Drive Appearance**: We varied the type of drives dropped at each location to determine whether users picked up the drive for altruistic or selfish reasons. Two types were designed to trigger altruistic tendencies: drives with a return address or with keys attached. Two were intended to trigger selfish tendencies: drives labeled "confidential" or "final exam solutions." One was our control group: drives with no label. Examples of each are shown in Figure 1.

3. **Time of Day**: We dropped drives during the morning (6–10 am) and afternoon (1–5 pm). By varying the drop time, we hoped to target faculty, staff, and students both coming to and leaving campus.

We dropped each of the five drive types at two times of day at 30 locations, for a total of 5 × 2 × 30 = 300 drives.

### B. Drive Content
Each drive contained files consistent with its external appearance, as depicted in Figure 2. The only difference was that all the files on the drives were HTML documents, which contained an `img` tag for an image located on a centrally controlled server. This embedded image allowed us to detect when a file was opened from an Internet-connected computer but did not execute any code on the machine. The HTML file also explained the study, allowed recipients to withdraw from the experiment, and included a link to a follow-up survey. We emphasize that we did not automatically run any code on participants' machines. As such, we may undercount responses if a user connected the drive but did not open any of the HTML files.

- (b) Business Contents—Confidential drives contain these files.
- (c) Exam Contents—Exam drives contain these files. Note that only one folder is expanded for brevity; all other folders contain the same file names.

### C. Survey
To understand why users picked up the flash drives and to measure users' risk attitudes, we offered users who picked up flash drives the opportunity to complete an anonymous survey on their risk attitudes for $10 compensation. In this survey, we asked participants a range of questions using SurveyMonkey [44] that broadly measured a user's risk-taking profile, computer security expertise, and rationale for plugging in the flash drive. Specifically, we asked about:

1. **Demographics**: We asked demographic questions from SurveyMonkey's question bank (e.g., age, sex, and level of education) [45].
2. **Affiliation**: We asked about the participant's affiliation with the University of Illinois (e.g., faculty, staff, or student).
3. **Previous Knowledge**: We asked if the participant had previously heard about the study. We later discarded responses where the user had pre-existing knowledge.
4. **Motivation**: We asked the participant why they picked up the flash drive and if external appearance or any other factor affected their decision.
5. **Computer Expertise and Behaviors**: We asked questions from the SeBIS Survey [4] to measure the participants' computer and computer security behaviors and three questions from another study [27] to measure their computer expertise.
6. **Risk Attitude**: We presented questions from the DOSPERT Survey [5], a standardized survey for measuring how likely a participant is to engage in risky behavior.
7. **Internet Usage**: We asked how much time the user spent online on a weekly basis. Previous studies have found that time spent on the Internet and visits to certain types of websites correlate with cybercrime victimization or malware encounters [24], [26]–[28], [30].

We also added six confirmation questions that instructed participants to choose a specific answer to check whether they were still paying attention to the survey. Once the participant finished the survey, they were offered the choice of a $10 Amazon gift card or to meet a researcher in person and collect $10 in cash compensation.

To collect baseline values for the University of Illinois, we emailed a random 600 members of the Illinois community in December 2015, asking them to complete a version of the survey with the USB-related questions removed. The surveys were otherwise identical, and participants were compensated with either a $5 Amazon gift card or $5 in cash compensation.

### D. Ethical Considerations
We submitted and received IRB approval for both the experiment and baseline survey. We explicitly note that our experiment employed a degree of deception: we misrepresented the purpose and content of the flash drives. Throughout the experiment, we provided participants with contact information for both our team and the University of Illinois IRB. We allowed participants to exclude themselves from the experiment when they clicked on any of the HTML files on the flash drives. We received no negative feedback from participants, and as we discuss in Section IV, several participants expressed appreciation for the research and asked about our results.

To minimize the risk to participants' computers, we did not automatically run any code on participants' systems, and the HTML files contained no scripts. We purchased the USB drives from a reputable vendor and tested the drives to ensure they did not present any unusual warnings on our test systems.

### E. Execution
We dropped 297 flash drives during the week of April 27, 2015, a typical week on the campus. Our team dropped 143 drives on 4/27, 145 drives on 4/28, and 9 drives on 4/29. A team of eight students dropped drives in plain sight. Our protocol was similar to the one defined by Lastdrager et al., in which students would walk around, pretend to tie their shoelaces, look around to see if anybody noticed them, and then drop the USB key before walking away [46].

After dropping the drives, the researchers recorded the location of the drive on a smartphone. Throughout the day, the researchers would check on the location and record whether the drive had been moved or removed. Researchers were instructed not to touch or move the drives and not to interact with any subjects. Drives were checked once per drop period (6–10 am, 1–5 pm) until they were taken or until the end of 5/1.

## IV. Results
We analyzed the drives that were picked up, the drives connected to a computer, and the files opened on each drive. We present the details of this analysis in this section.

Participants opened one or more files on 135 of the 297 flash drives (45%) and 290 of the drives (98%) were removed from their drop locations by the end of our observation period. It is not clear if users plugged in the remaining 155 drives—a participant might have plugged in a drive without opening a file or simply might not have connected the drive. However, these two numbers allow us to bound the attack's success rate to be between 45–98%. Of the 135 users who plugged a drive into their computer, 77 (57%) did not explicitly opt-in to providing detailed data. We include them in the raw number of users who plugged in a drive but exclude them from any further analysis in this study.

### A. Factors Affecting Success Rate
When we dropped drives, we varied (1) geographic location, (2) time of day, and (3) drive appearance. We applied the test of equal proportions and found that geographic location, time of day, and day of the week had no effect on whether a user plugged in the drive (Table I). While none of the different drive types had a higher success rate, the drives with return labels had a lower success rate: only 17 of 59 (29%) of drives with return address labels were plugged in compared to 27 of 60 (45%) of unlabeled drives (p = 0.10). We suspect this is because altruistic participants had another means of locating the drive owner. We present the exact values for each category in Table I.

### B. Opened Files
We analyzed the files that users opened to determine whether users were acting altruistically or selfishly. While the fact that fewer participants connected drives with return address labels suggests that users are acting altruistically, the order of file openings indicates that nearly half of the users, after initially connecting the drive with altruistic intentions, opened intriguing files such as vacation photos before attempting to find the owner.

## V. Conclusion
Our results highlight the effectiveness of social engineering attacks, even in the form of simple, low-tech methods like dropping USB flash drives. The high success rate and rapid connection times underscore the need for better security awareness and training. Users, regardless of their technical competence, are susceptible to such attacks, primarily due to altruistic motives and curiosity. We hope that by bringing these details to light, we can prompt the security community to address the ongoing threat posed by social engineering. Future work should focus on understanding the dynamics of social engineering, developing technical defenses, and teaching users how to protect themselves effectively.
