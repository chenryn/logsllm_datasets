Abstract—We investigate the anecdotal belief that end users
will pick up and plug in USB ﬂash drives they ﬁnd by completing
a controlled experiment in which we drop 297 ﬂash drives on
a large university campus. We ﬁnd that the attack is effective
with an estimated success rate of 45–98% and expeditious with
the ﬁrst drive connected in less than six minutes. We analyze
the types of drives users connected and survey those users to
understand their motivation and security proﬁle. We ﬁnd that
a drive’s appearance does not increase attack success. Instead,
users connect the drive with the altruistic intention of ﬁnding the
owner. These individuals are not technically incompetent, but are
rather typical community members who appear to take more
recreational risks then their peers. We conclude with lessons
learned and discussion on how social engineering attacks—while
less technical—continue to be an effective attack vector that our
community has yet to successfully address.
I. INTRODUCTION
The security community has long held the belief that users
can be socially engineered into picking up and plugging in
seemingly lost USB ﬂash drives they ﬁnd. Unfortunately,
whether driven by altruistic motives or human curiosity, the
user unknowingly opens their organization to an internal
attack when they connect the drive—a physical Trojan horse.
Our community is ﬁlled with anecdotes of these attacks and
pentesters have even boasted that they can hack humans by
crafting labels that will pique an individual’s curiosity [1]:
“While in the bathroom, I place an envelope in one stall. On
the cover of the envelope I put a sticker that says PRIVATE.
Inside the ’private’ envelope is a USB key with a malicious
payload on it. I do this in one stall and also in the hallway by
a break room to increase my chances and hope that the person
that ﬁnds one of them is curious enough to insert it into their
computer. Sure enough, this method seems to always work.”
However, despite recent attacks that underscore the risk
of malicious peripherals [2], [3] and rumors of the attack’s
efﬁcacy, there has been little formal analysis of whether the
attack is effective nor why users connect the drives. In this
work, we investigate the classic anecdote by conducting a large
scale experiment in which we drop nearly 300 ﬂash drives of
different types, in different locations, and at different times on
the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign campus.
We measure the efﬁcacy and speed of the attack by replacing
expected ﬁles on the drive with HTML ﬁles containing an
embedded img tag that allows us to track when a ﬁle is opened
on each drive without automatically executing any code. We
ﬁnd that users pick up and connect an estimated 45%–98% of
the drives we dropped. Further, the attack is expeditious with a
median time to connection of 6.9 hours and the ﬁrst connection
occurring within six minutes from when the drive was dropped.
Contrary to popular belief, the appearance of a drive does not
increase the likelihood that someone will connect it to their
computer. Instead, users connect all types of drives unless
there are other means of locating the owner—suggesting that
participants are altruistically motivated. However, while users
initially connect the drive with altruistic intentions, nearly half
are overcome with curiosity and open intriguing ﬁles—such
as vacation photos—before trying to ﬁnd the drive’s owner.
To better understand users’ motivations and rationale, we
offered participants the opportunity to complete a short survey
when they opened any of the ﬁles and read about the study.
In this survey, we ask users why they connected the drive, the
precautions they took, demographic information, as well as
standard questions to measure their risk proﬁle and computer
expertise. We ﬁnd that attack was effective against all sub-
populations at Illinois. The majority of respondents connected
a drive to locate its owner (68%) or out of curiosity (18%),
although a handful also admitted they planned on keeping the
drive for themselves.
The students and staff that connected the drives were not
computer nor security illiterate and were not signiﬁcantly differ-
ent than their peers at the University of Illinois on Egelman and
Peer’s Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) [4]. While
the users that connected the drive engaged in riskier behavior
than their peers on the DOSPERT scale [5], they were more
risk averse than the general population in every domain except
for recreational risk.
When prompted, 68% of users stated that they took no
precautions when connecting the drive. For those respondents
who considered protective measures, 10 (16%) scanned the
drive with their anti-virus software and 5 (8%) believed that
their operating system or security software would protect them,
e.g., “I trust my macbook to be a good defense against viruses”.
Surprisingly, another 5 (8%) sacriﬁced a personal computer or
used university resources to protect their personal equipment.
In the end, all but a handful of the users who took precautions
did so in an ineffective manner and the majority took no
precautions at all.
These results—particularly the risk averseness relative to
the general population on the DOSPERT scale—suggest that
the attack would be effective against most users and that the
average person does not understand the danger of connecting an
unknown peripheral to their computer. We hope that by bringing
these details to light, we remind the security community that

some of the simplest attacks remain realistic threats. There is
still much work needed to understand the dynamics of social
engineering, develop technical defenses, and learn how to
effectively teach users how to protect themselves.
II. RELATED WORK
Our work is based on anecdotal evidence that users will plug
in USB ﬂash drives they stumble upon [6]–[9] and prior work
that has shown that simply connecting a USB drive presents
an immediate risk.
Removable Device Attacks. Microsoft Windows no
longer automatically executes arbitrary code when connecting
a USB drive [10], which defeats many of the traditional
attacks [11], [12]. However, despite this precaution, connecting
a USB drive still poses signiﬁcant risk. In 2014, Nohl
et al. showed that an attacker can reprogram the ﬁrmware
in a USB drive to convert it into a USB human interface
device that automatically executes malicious code, or into a
network interface that intercepts sensitive trafﬁc [13]. Similarly,
ﬁle previews are automatically generated on connection and
vulnerabilities in installed applications can enable an attack.
For example, in 2013, a vulnerability in SketchUp allowed
code execution during ﬁle preview generation [14]. Larimer
showed that the same vein of attacks are possible on Linux [15]
and work by both Sevinsky [16] and Hudson [17] extended
this attack beyond USB to Thunderbolt devices.
USB Drive Engineering. Despite the pervasiveness of the
belief that users will plug in USB drives they ﬁnd, there has
been no peer-reviewed research on the topic. Jacobs informally
investigated the question: “Are USB ﬂash drives an effective
social-engineering vector for cyber attacks targeting commercial
and residential computer systems?” in his masters thesis and
found that 11 out of 30 ﬂash drives were opened in each
of the commercial and residential areas [18]. More recently,
CompTIA commissioned a study that dropped 200 ﬂash drives
containing text ﬁles with email addresses or trackable links
in “high trafﬁc public spaces” in four cities. They also ﬁelded
a survey but did not survey participants who interacted with
the ﬂash drives [19]. We compare our results to both studies
throughout the paper.
Social Engineering Attacks. There have been several
studies that broadly focus on social engineering. Researchers
have used social networks to increase the effectiveness of
phishing attacks [20]. Wright left 50 unsecured smartphones
in cities to observe their ﬁnders’ behaviors [21]. Christin et. al
investigated the incentive necessary to convince users to run
an unknown binary using Mechanical Turk [22]. Greitzer et al.
deﬁne the Unintentional Insider Threat problem, discuss case
studies, and provide recommendations [23].
Social Engineering Susceptibility. There have been sev-
eral studies that aimed to determine the relationship between
demographic factors and cybercrime victims [24]–[30]. Beyond
speciﬁc attacks, there have been several studies that measured
what factors affect security hygiene and user behavior [31]–
[35].
Decision Making. There has been much previous work on
human decision making processes. We build on this literature,
using the DOSPERT scale [5], [36] to measure participants’
risk-taking proﬁle and the SeBIS survey [4] to measure security
knowledge and behavior. Our work underscores existing
literature on users’ attitudes towards security [37]–[42], further
suggesting that users can generally identify technology risks
but do not necessarily understand them.
III. METHODOLOGY
To determine whether users pick up and connect USB ﬂash
drives they ﬁnd, we dropped 297 ﬂash drives at the University
of Illinois Urbana-Champaign—a large academic institution
in the United States —and measured who connected the drives
and why.
Each ﬂash drive contained ﬁles that are named consistently
with the drive’s appearance, but are HTML ﬁles containing
an img tag that referenced our centrally managed server and
offered the user an opportunity to answer a survey about why
they picked up the ﬂash drive. We measured (1) whether users
picked up the ﬂash drives (2) whether users later plugged
connected the drives and opened ﬁles and (3) why users plugged
in the ﬂash drives. In this section, we describe our experiment
in detail.
A. Drive Selection and Placement
We wanted to measure not only whether users picked up
ﬂash drives, but whether external appearance affects users’
behavior. In our experiment, we varied the (1) geographic drop
location, (2) the physical appearance of the drive (e.g., using
an external label), and (3) the time of day and measured their
effect:
1) Geographic Location. We placed ﬂash drives at
30 unique locations on the campus, ten at each of three
sub-campuses (Main Quad, South Quad, and Engineering
Quad). On each sub-campus, we placed drives at ﬁve
location types: parking lots1, hallways, academic areas
(e.g., classrooms or libraries), common areas (e.g., building
lobbies or cafeterias), and outside (e.g., sidewalks). We
distributed the experiment among the three sub-campuses
to reduce the chance of arousing suspicion.
2) Drive Appearance. We varied the type of drives
dropped at each location to determine whether users
picked up the drive for altruistic or selﬁsh reasons.2
Two types are engineered to trigger altruistic tendencies:
drives with a return address or with keys attached; two
are intended to trigger selﬁsh tendencies: drives with the
label “conﬁdential” or “ﬁnal exam solutions“; one is our
control group: drives with no label. We show an example
of each in Fig. 1.
3) Time of Day. We dropped drives during the morning
(6– 10am) and afternoon (1– 5pm). By varying drop time,
we hoped to target faculty, staff, and students both coming
to and leaving campus.
We dropped each of the ﬁve drive types at two times of day
at 30 locations for a total 5 × 2 × 30 = 300 drives.
1Five of the six parking lots are designated for faculty/staff only.
2Prior work by Forbes et al. have argued that participants who return keys
do so for altruistic reasons [43].

Fig. 1: Drive Appearances—We dropped ﬁve different types of drives. We chose two appearances (keys and return label)
to motivate altruism and two appearances (conﬁdential and exam solutions) to motivate self-interest, as well as an unlabeled
control.
B. Drive Content
Each drive contained ﬁles consistent with external appear-
ance, as depicted in Fig. 2. The only difference was that
all of the ﬁles on the drives were HTML documents, which
contained an img tag for an image located on a centrally
controlled server. This embedded image allowed us to detect
when a ﬁle was opened from an Internet-connected computer,
but did not execute any code on the machine. The HTML
ﬁle also explained the study, allowed recipients to withdraw
from the experiment, and included a link to a follow-up survey.
We emphasize that we do not automatically run any code on
participants’ machines. As such, we may under count responses
if a user connected the drive, but did not open any of the HTML
ﬁles.
C. Survey
To understand why users picked up the ﬂash drives and to
measure users’ risk attitudes, we offered users who picked
up ﬂash drives the opportunity to complete an anonymous
survey on their risk attitudes for $10 compensation. In this
survey, we asked participants a range of questions using
SurveyMonkey [44] that broadly measured a user’s risk-taking
proﬁle, computer security expertise, and rationale for plugging
in the ﬂash drive. We speciﬁcally asked about:
1) Demographics. We asked demographic questions from
SurveyMonkey’s question bank (e.g., age, sex, and level
of education) [45].
2) Afﬁliation. We asked a participant their afﬁliation with
the University of Illinois (e.g., faculty, staff, or student).
3) Previous Knowledge. We asked if the participant had
previously heard about the study. We later discarded
responses where the user had pre-existing knowledge.
4) Motivation. We asked the participant why they picked
up the ﬂash drive and if external appearance or any other
factor affected their decision.
5) Computer Expertise and Behaviors. We asked ques-
tions from the SeBIS Survey [4] to measure the partic-
ipants’ computer and computer security behaviors and
three questions from another study [27] to measure their
computer expertise.
6) Risk Attitude. We presented questions
from the
DOSPERT Survey [5], a standardized survey for mea-
suring how likely a participant is to take part in risky
behavior.
7) Internet Usage. We asked how much time the user spent
online on a weekly basis. We asked this because previous
studies have found that time spent on the Internet and
visits to certain types of websites correlate with cybercrime
victimization or malware encounters [24], [26]–[28], [30].
We also added six conﬁrmation questions that instructed
participants to chose a speciﬁc answer in order to check
whether they were still paying attention to the survey. Once the
participant ﬁnished the survey, they were offered the choice of
a $10 Amazon gift card or to meet a researcher in person and
collect $10 in cash compensation.
To collect baseline values for the University of Illinois, we
emailed a random 600 members of the Illinois community
in December 2015, in which we asked users to complete a
version of the survey with the USB-related questions removed.
The surveys were otherwise identical and participants were
compensated with either a $5 Amazon gift card or $5 in cash
compensation.
D. Ethical Considerations
We submitted and received IRB approval for both the
experiment and base line survey. We explicitly note that our
experiment employed a degree of deception: we misrepresented
the purpose of and content on the ﬂash drives. Throughout the
experiment, we provided participants with contact information
for both our team and the University of Illinois IRB. We allowed
participants to exclude themselves from the experiment when
they clicked on any of the HTML ﬁles on the ﬂash drives.
We received no negative feedback from participants and as
we discuss in Section IV; several participants expressed their
appreciation for the research and asked about our results.
To minimize the risk to participants’ computers, we did not
automatically run any code on participants’ systems and the
HTML ﬁles contained no scripts. We purchased the USB drives
from a reputable vendor and tested the drives to ensure they
did not present any unusual warnings on our test systems.
E. Execution
We dropped 297 ﬂash drives during the week of April
27, 2015, a typical week on the campus.3 Our team dropped
143 drives on 4/27, 145 drives on 4/28, and 9 drives on 4/29.
A team of eight students dropped drives in plain sight. Our
3We intended to drop 300 drives. One drive was lost during the experiment,
and a researcher could not physically access one location to drop two drives.

protocol was similar to the one deﬁned by Lastdrager et al.,
in which students would walk around and pretend to tie their
shoelaces, look around to see if anybody noticed them, and
then drop the USB key before walking away [46].
After dropping the drives, the researchers recorded the
location of the drive on a smartphone. Throughout the day, the
researchers would check on the location and record whether the
drive had been moved or removed. Researchers were instructed
not to touch or move the drives and not to interact with any
subjects. Drives were checked once per drop period (6–10 am,
1–5 pm) until they were taken or until the end of 5/1.
IV. RESULTS
We analyzed the drives that were picked up, the drives
connected to a computer, and the ﬁles opened on each drive.
We present the details of this analysis in this section.
Participants opened one or more ﬁles on 135 of the 297 ﬂash
drives (45%) and 290 of the drives (98%) were removed from
their drop locations by the end of our observation period. It
is not clear if users plugged in the remaining 155 drives— a
participant might have plugged in a drive without opening a ﬁle
or simply might not have had connected the drive. However,
these two numbers allow us to bound the attack’s success
rate to be between 45–98%. Of the 135 users who plugged a
drive into their computer, 77 (57%) did not explicitly opt-in to
providing detailed data. We include them in the raw number
of users who plugged in a drive, but exclude them from any
further analysis in this study.4
A. Affecting Success Rate
When we dropped drives, we varied (1) geographic location,
(2) time of day, and (3) drive appearance. We applied the test
of equal proportions and ﬁnd that geographic location, time
of day, and day of week have no affect on whether a user
plugs in the drive (Table I). While none of the different drive
types had a higher success rate, the drives with return labels
had a lower success rate: only 17 of 59 (29%) of drives with
return address labels were plugged in compared to 27 of 60
(45%) of unlabeled drives (p = 0.10). We suspect that this is
because altruistic participants had another means of locating
the drive owner. We present the exact values for each category
in Table I.
B. Opened Files
We analyzed the ﬁles that users opened to determine whether
users are acting altruistically or selﬁshly. While the fact that
fewer participants connected drives with return address labels
suggests that users are acting altruistically, the order of ﬁle
