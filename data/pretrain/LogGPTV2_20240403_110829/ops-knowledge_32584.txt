Assistant: Description of the problem: After restarting the service, the data is normal for a short time, and then the data starts to be delayed. At this time, it is the optimization problem of the database. There are too many accumulated historical data, the pressure on the database is too great, and the IO is running slowly. Solution 1. Minimize the storage period of monitoring indicators and historical and trend data, and reduce the load. Solution 2: Regularly clean up historical data that is too long. The database is partitioned in the following table. Historical data should be saved less, and trend data can be stored longer. Solution 3: Optimize database configuration and adjust related parameters to improve performance.
