Assistant: To configure Remote Desktop Services in Windows Server to support multiple user logins, you can follow the steps below: 1. Enable Remote Desktop Services on the server. This can be done by opening the "Server Manager" window, selecting the "Remote Desktop Services" menu, and clicking the "Add Roles and Features" button. 2. Set up "Remote Desktop Services" (RDS) in the "Add Roles and Features Wizard", then click the "Next" button and accept the license terms. 3. Install the required components in RDS. To do this, click on the "Role-based or feature-based installation" tab. 4. Select the components to be installed and follow the prompts to complete the installation. Please make sure that the "Remote Desktop Session Host" component is properly installed. 5. Open the "Remote Desktop Session Host Configuration" window, right-click, and select "Properties" from the pop-up menu. 6. Go to the "RD Session Host Server Settings" tab, expand the "Connections" section, and select the "Allow users to connect remotely to this computer" option. 7. Click the "Add" button and add users or groups to allow access to the server in the "Select Users or Groups" dialog box that appears. 8. Restart the server for the changes to take effect. 9. Start the "Remote Desktop Connection" software, enter the IP address or name of the server and the user name and password to log in, and press the "Connect" button. 10. If everything is set correctly, you should be able to successfully log into the server and use Remote Desktop. Note that if multiple users are logged in remotely at the same time, the session will run as multiple users, in separate desktop sessions.
