Abstract. Handheld devices today do not continuously verify the iden-
tity of the user while sensitive activities are performed. This enables
attackers, who can either compromise the initial password or grab the
device after login, full access to sensitive data and applications on the
device. To mitigate this risk, we propose continuous user monitoring
using a machine learning based approach comprising of an ensemble of
three distinct modalities: power consumption, touch gestures, and physi-
cal movement. Users perform diﬀerent activities on diﬀerent applications:
we consider application context when we model user behavior. We employ
anomaly detection algorithms for each modality and place a bound on
the fraction of anomalous events that can be considered “normal” for any
given user. We evaluated our system using data collected from 73 volun-
teer participants. We were able to verify that our system is functional in
real-time while the end-user was utilizing popular mobile applications.

1 Introduction
The amount of sensitive data stored on or processed by handheld devices has
been on the rise. This is primarily due to a wealth of services that were made
available over the last few years including access to emails, social media, bank-
ing, personal calendars, navigation and documents. Most commercially available
devices employ the use of authentication techniques only at the “entry-point”.
They require the user to explicitly authenticate before every handheld device
interaction but not necessarily when sensitive operations are performed. Thus,
although users might be required to use their password often, sensitive data can
be misused when an attacker gains physical access to a device immediately after
authentication is completed.
There is a plethora of recent work that indicates that password authentication
is not appropriate for mobile devices. For instance, Aviv et al. [1] demonstrated
the feasibility of smudge attacks using residue oils on touch screen devices. Using

this technique, the attackers could extract sensitive information about recent
user input, which may include the legitimate user’s successful authentication
attempt. While intentional misuse of data is a concern, Muslukhov et al. [2]
showed that users are also concerned about sharing mobile phones with guest
users. Moreover, Karlson et al. [3] conducted interviews of smartphone users and
concluded that the entry-point authentication model is too coarse-grained and
the type of data that can be considered sensitive varies signiﬁcantly depending
upon the owner’s relationship to the guest user. For example, the information
that is considered sensitive in the presence of colleagues is diﬀerent in nature
from what is considered sensitive among business clients or competitors. How-
ever, protecting every piece of data with additional security mechanisms poses
a usability hindrance.
In order to address the shortcomings of the entry-point authentication model,
one of the approaches proposed in literature is called continuous authentica-
tion [4]. This is a process of verifying the identity of the user repeatedly while
the handheld device is in use. Generally, continuous authentication methods
assume that the process of authentication is unobtrusive. This is necessary as it
is impractical to require users to explicitly authenticate themselves at recurring
intervals.
In this paper, we propose a technique to authenticate users on handheld
devices based on a diverse set of behavioral biometric modalities comprised of
power consumption, touch gestures, and physical movement. We are one of the
ﬁrst research groups to propose the use of power measurements as a poten-
tial form of authentication for modern (Android) mobile devices. In addition
to power behavior, we have implemented touch screen gestures and physical
movement as modalities (both are independent behavioral traits in accordance
with the survey paper on behavioral biometrics by Yampolskiy et al. [9]). These
modalities use measurements from the touch input driver, and from a combina-
tion of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements respectively. In this paper,
we show that the fusion of these three modalities can be used to corroborate the
presence of a legitimate user while capturing long-term characteristics (power
modality), short-term physical movement which includes hand vibrations (move-
ment modality), as well as direct device interaction (touch modality).
The proposed approach includes a decision support process (see Fig. 1) where
we build models based only on a set of measurements (system readings) for the
legitimate user. To detect unauthorized access, we rely on those user-tailored
models to provide us with evidence of deviation from the generated user enve-
lope. The decision support process institutes a “test” that requires that no more
than n readings within a window of events or time be anomalous, before the
user’s capabilities are diminished on the device. This threshold can be adjusted
to obtain the desired False Reject Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR),
a trade-oﬀ that we explored in this paper. We show that every user is prone to
infrequent anomalous behavior that is dispersed throughout the user’s interac-
tion with the mobile device and the rate at which these anomalies are expected
varies for each user. As a result, the number of n readings that are allowed to be

anomalous is part of a user’s proﬁle and we show that by using individualized
thresholds, we improved performance of our authentication system.
We also show that authentication accuracy is aﬀected by application context;
any user’s behavior diﬀers from application to application. When a user is playing
a game, the digital footprint that the user leaves behind in terms of power
consumption, touch screen gestures or physical movement is expected to be
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from when the user is sending text messages. We present
the performance of our system on two popular mobile applications – Google
Chrome and Facebook – and show that by ignoring the application context,
there is a clear degradation in identiﬁcation accuracy.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a brief review of
research publications that are related to the work done in this paper. Section 3
discusses the implementation details of our data collection architecture. Section 4
provides the experimental design and protocol used while collecting data from
volunteers. Section 5 describes how the data was prepared for analysis. Section 6
identiﬁes the algorithms employed for the task of continuous authentication of
users in mobile devices. Section 7 presents a performance evaluation of the algo-
rithms on the data collected. In Sects. 9 and 10, we suggest further research
directions and conclude this paper.

Riva et al. [6] presented an architecture that grants users access to any content on
the device only when the authentication system evaluates the device operator’s
level of authenticity to be higher than what is required to access that content.
Their system utilized face and voice recognition, location familiarity, and deter-
mining possession by sensing nearby electronic objects as signals to establish
the legitimate user’s level of authenticity. They motivated their work with a
user study that explored models where there are at-least 3 levels of security:
public, private, and conﬁdential. With this framework, they tested nine users,
408

and were able to reduce the number of explicit authentications by 42 %. While
the use of environmental signals in the authentication system help in reacting
to device theft, it does not solve the problem of data misuse while in familiar
surroundings.
Shi et al. [5] presented an approach that built on the concept that most users
are habitual in nature and are prone to performing similar tasks at a certain time
of the day. The researchers collected a wide range of behavioral information such
as location, communication, and usage of applications, in order to create a user
proﬁle. Their method is based on identiﬁcation of positive events and boost-
ing the authentication score when a “good” or habitual event is observed. The
passage of time is treated as a negative event in that scores gradually degrade.
One of the main caveats with this work is that it is trying to model what good
geographic locations, phone calls, text messages, and website urls are. The data
collected is highly intrusive in terms of privacy. They further model all good
events as ones that are expected to be performed at a certain time of day, which
is an assumption of habit that is not proven in the literature. However, if this
works well, it can also be incorporated as another voter in our approach.
Kwapisz et al. [10] published a system to identify and authenticate users
based on accelerometer data. They used a dataset of 36 users, labeled according
to activities such as walking, jogging, and climbing stairs. These labels were used
as context and the authors presented analysis with and without these labels. For
feature extraction, the authors divided the 3 axes readings of the accelerome-
ter into windows of 10 s, and for each window they extracted features such as
mean, standard deviation, resultant, and binned distribution. For identiﬁcation,
the authors performed a 36-class classiﬁcation, whereas for the task of authenti-
cation, the authors reduced the problem to a 2-class problem. They achieved a
classiﬁcation accuracy of 72.2 % for 10 s windows. While they concluded based
on their results that it is not critical to know what activity the user is perform-
ing, their dataset was generated by users repeating a limited set of pre-deﬁned
activities. In contrast, instead of using real-world activities as context which
requires manual labeling of the data, we consider the applications being used by
the users as context which can be automated. We were able to show that user
behavior is indeed subject to application context.
Frank et al. [7] performed a study where they collected touch screen behavior
of 41 users and designed a proof-of-concept classiﬁcation framework to examine
the applicability of screen touches as a behavioral biometric. For their data col-
lection, they designed a custom application that allowed users to swipe vertically
and horizontally. Using this dataset as baseline, they matched users based on
how they perform the same task in testing phase. For analyzing this data, they
separated each type of stroke and matched 30 diﬀerent features (such as mid-
stroke area covered, 20 % pairwise velocity, and mid-stroke pressure) extracted
for each stroke. Their study resulted in mis-classiﬁcation error rates in the range
of 0 % to 4 %. Although the researchers were able to demonstrate good perfor-
mance while matching gestures in a controlled environment, they limited their
analysis to vertical and horizontal swipes on their own application. The analysis

depended on the concept that users are performing repetitive pre-deﬁned tasks.
In the real world, diﬀerent users can perform a large variety of tasks that cannot
be modelled individually. This technique clearly has a problem of scale that was
not addressed in the paper.
Both Kwapisz et al. and Frank et al. created a two-class problem where the
adversarial class had data points from other users. Contrastingly for traditional
computing devices, Killourhy et al. [11] and Shen et al. [12] published a compar-
ison of various anomaly-detection algorithms for keystroke dynamics and mouse
dynamics respectively, limiting the discussion to 1-class veriﬁcation due to lack
of availability of imposter data in the real-world. In truth, the number of classes
representing adversaries is unbounded. Modeling adversaries into a ﬁxed number
of classes leads to overﬁtting and lack of generalization, which results in poor
performance of the deployed system.
Bo et al. [8] attempted to create a model to speciﬁcally identify transitions
or change of hands between the device owner and a guest who may or may not
be a known entity. The researchers model a user by leveraging her/his touch
screen interactions as well as device feedback in form of vibrations into one
single model. Though the device initially has only the owner’s behavior data,
and a one-class SVM model is trained to provide a judgment whether a new
action belongs to the owner or not, the researchers quickly evolve this into a
two-class SVM model by collecting guest user’s data into a second class. They
assign a conﬁdence to this judgment, and the conclusion conﬁdence increases
with a continuous sequence of consistent judgments. When a change of user is
detected, the sequence of consistent judgment is dissolved. While the authors
demonstrate 100 % identiﬁcation accuracy within a sequence of 5 to 10 obser-
vations, the analysis fails to show tolerance with anomalies, or in other words,
the inherent noise. There is no detailed discussion about ﬁnding a new guest
user verses anomalies committed by the device owner. Further, their model also
does not consider diﬀerent user behavior in diﬀerent usage scenarios, such as the
application context considered in our work.
Although we know of no other biometric systems based on power consump-
tion as an identiﬁer, there is widespread research in the area of power model
generation on electronic devices. Zhang et al. [13] presented an automated power
model construction technique that uses built-in battery voltage sensors and
knowledge of battery discharge behavior to monitor power consumption of each
application on an electronic device. They achieved an absolute average error rate
of less than 10 %. Murmuria et al. [14] demonstrated that the power consump-
tion by individual device drivers on a smartphone varies by state of operation
of that particular device driver. Shye et al. [15] presented a power estimation
model by leveraging real user behavior. They presented evidence that system
power consumption patterns are highly correlated with user behavior patterns,
but stopped short of trying to proﬁle users on this basis.
