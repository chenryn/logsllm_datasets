## Abstract
Modern handheld devices typically do not continuously verify the user's identity during sensitive operations. This vulnerability allows attackers, who may have compromised the initial password or gained physical access to the device after login, to access sensitive data and applications. To address this risk, we propose a continuous user monitoring system that employs a machine learning approach combining three distinct modalities: power consumption, touch gestures, and physical movement. Our system considers the application context when modeling user behavior and uses anomaly detection algorithms for each modality, with a bound on the fraction of anomalous events that can be considered "normal" for any given user. We evaluated our system using data from 73 volunteer participants and demonstrated its real-time functionality while users were interacting with popular mobile applications.

## 1. Introduction
The amount of sensitive data stored and processed on handheld devices has increased significantly due to the availability of various services such as email, social media, banking, personal calendars, navigation, and document management. Most commercially available devices use authentication techniques only at the "entry-point," requiring explicit user authentication before each interaction but not necessarily during sensitive operations. Consequently, although users may frequently enter their passwords, sensitive data can still be misused if an attacker gains physical access to the device immediately after authentication.

Recent research indicates that traditional password authentication is not suitable for mobile devices. For example, Aviv et al. [1] demonstrated the feasibility of smudge attacks, where residue oils on touch screens can reveal recent user input, including successful authentication attempts. Additionally, Muslukhov et al. [2] showed that users are concerned about sharing mobile phones with guest users. Karlson et al. [3] concluded that the entry-point authentication model is too coarse-grained, as the sensitivity of data varies depending on the relationship between the owner and the guest user. However, implementing additional security mechanisms for every piece of data poses usability challenges.

To address these shortcomings, continuous authentication has been proposed in the literature [4]. This method verifies the user's identity repeatedly while the device is in use, ensuring that the process is unobtrusive and practical.

In this paper, we propose a continuous authentication technique for handheld devices using a diverse set of behavioral biometric modalities: power consumption, touch gestures, and physical movement. We are among the first to explore power measurements as a form of authentication for modern (Android) mobile devices. In addition to power behavior, we incorporate touch screen gestures and physical movement, which are independent behavioral traits according to Yampolskiy et al. [9]. These modalities use measurements from the touch input driver and a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope data, respectively. We show that the fusion of these three modalities can effectively corroborate the presence of a legitimate user by capturing long-term characteristics (power modality), short-term physical movements (movement modality), and direct device interactions (touch modality).

Our approach includes a decision support process (Fig. 1) where we build models based on measurements for the legitimate user. To detect unauthorized access, we use these user-tailored models to identify deviations from the expected behavior. The decision support process sets a threshold on the number of anomalous readings within a window of events or time, beyond which the user's capabilities are restricted. This threshold can be adjusted to balance the False Reject Rate (FRR) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR). We demonstrate that each user exhibits infrequent anomalous behavior, and by using individualized thresholds, we improve the performance of our authentication system.

We also show that authentication accuracy is influenced by the application context, as user behavior varies across different applications. For instance, the digital footprint left by a user playing a game differs significantly from that of a user sending text messages. We present the performance of our system on two popular mobile applications, Google Chrome and Facebook, and show that ignoring the application context degrades identification accuracy.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 discusses the implementation details of our data collection architecture, Section 4 provides the experimental design and protocol used for data collection, Section 5 describes the data preparation for analysis, Section 6 identifies the algorithms employed for continuous authentication, Section 7 presents a performance evaluation of the algorithms, and Sections 8 and 9 suggest further research directions and conclude the paper.

## 2. Related Work
Riva et al. [6] proposed an architecture that grants access to content based on the user's level of authenticity, using face and voice recognition, location familiarity, and possession of nearby electronic objects. Their system reduced the number of explicit authentications by 42% in a user study with nine participants. While environmental signals help in detecting device theft, they do not prevent data misuse in familiar surroundings.

Shi et al. [5] developed a method that leverages users' habitual behavior, collecting information on location, communication, and application usage to create a user profile. Their approach boosts the authentication score when a habitual event is observed, with scores degrading over time. However, this method is highly intrusive in terms of privacy and assumes that good events occur at specific times, which is not always true.

Kwapisz et al. [10] used accelerometer data to identify and authenticate users, achieving a classification accuracy of 72.2% for 10-second windows. They concluded that knowing the user's activity is not critical, but their dataset was limited to predefined activities. In contrast, we consider the application context, which can be automated and more reflective of real-world usage.

Frank et al. [7] collected touch screen behavior from 41 users and designed a proof-of-concept framework to examine the applicability of screen touches as a behavioral biometric. Their study resulted in misclassification error rates ranging from 0% to 4%, but their analysis was limited to vertical and horizontal swipes in a controlled environment.

Bo et al. [8] created a model to detect transitions or changes in device ownership, using touch screen interactions and device feedback. They evolved a one-class SVM model into a two-class model by collecting guest user data. While they achieved 100% identification accuracy within a sequence of 5 to 10 observations, their model does not consider anomalies or different usage scenarios.

Although there is no other known biometric system based on power consumption, Zhang et al. [13] presented an automated power model construction technique with an absolute average error rate of less than 10%. Murmuria et al. [14] and Shye et al. [15] demonstrated that power consumption patterns are correlated with user behavior, but did not profile users based on this basis.
