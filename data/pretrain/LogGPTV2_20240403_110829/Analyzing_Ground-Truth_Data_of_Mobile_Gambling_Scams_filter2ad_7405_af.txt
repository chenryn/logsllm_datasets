by porting Valgrind to iOS to ﬁnd the abuse of private APIs.
Damopoulos et al. [90] dynamically analyzed iOS software
in terms of method invocation to detect malicious code.
Garcia et al. [91] investigated the features belonging to iOS
malware and classiﬁed samples of 36 iOS malware families
discovered between 2009 and 2015. Cimitile et al. [92] de-
signed a malware detector aimed at malicious iOS samples
exploiting machine learning and an opcode-based feature set.
Lee et al. [93] reported the ﬁrst measurement study on iOS
apps with hidden crowdturﬁng UIs.
In contrast to the apps handled by previous works, gambling
scam apps usually do not use private APIs or present patterns
of malicious behaviors, which the aforementioned detection
tools cannot detect. Instead, our study analyzes a ground-truth
dataset to proﬁle scam apps to point out potential features that
can be used for detection. Considering the ﬁndings of OAG
abuse, [46] reported the security issues/vulnerabilities of OAG
itself, which had a different study scope, compared with our
work. Recently, [47] mainly focused on unwanted distribution
channels vectors on Android devices. They discovered that
some OAGs were abused to generate and publish unwanted
apps (some of them were used to promote fraud ads). In this
paper, we take a step closer to real-world scam gambling ac-
tivities and report that the OAGs have been used in real-world
gambling scams. Besides, our study shows that some OAGs’
certiﬁcates have been abused to sign other gambling scam apps
(but not generated), which advances the understanding of the
OAG abuse.
X. CONCLUSION
With the rapid growth and popularity of mobile markets
today, mobile gambling scams have caused tremendous ﬁ-
nancial damage to individuals and corporations. This paper
provides the ﬁrst empirical study based on ground-truth data
of the mobile gambling scam consisting of 1,461 scam incident
reports associated with 1,068 Android apps and 419 iOS
apps provided by an Anonymous Authority. In particular,
we reveal social engineering techniques used by miscreants
via a qualitative analysis of these mobile gambling scam
incident reports. Such knowledge can be used as materials for
scam awareness training. In addition, we develop a suite of
measurement and dedicated reverse-engineering tools which
enabled us to characterize both Android and iOS gambling
scam apps, including their development frameworks, declared
permissions, the compatibility, and the backend network in-
frastructure. Our research reported two abused public online
app generators, i.e., DCloud and APICloud, used by miscreants
to create and sign scam apps. Moving forward, we also
examine the payment channels used by mobile scam apps and
estimate the revenue of the mobile gambling scam under the
payment channel of cryptocurrency and Idleﬁsh Money Mule.
Our ﬁndings bring new insight into the mobile gambling scam
ecosystem. Such understanding and artifacts will help better
defend against mobile gambling scam activities.
