From the output you can see that the PostgreSQL cluster is running on a host which is in legacy mode. This implies that PostgreSQL is running under cgroup v1, which until very recently was always the case when running containerized under Kubernetes. The alternatives are unified and hybrid. The former is what you will get if running on a cgroup v2 host, e.g. with a modern Linux kernel under systemd and with appropriate configuration. The mode hybrid indicates that the host is configured for both cgroup v1 and v2 -- this mode is (at least currently) explicitly not supported by pgnodemx.    
Although this blog is primarily focused on legacy Kubernetes installations, please allow a small sidebar discussion. If you did want to explore the use of pgnodemx on a host in unified mode under systemd, you probably need to add the following to your Linux kernel command line: systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=1 cgroup_no_v1=all. Additionally you will want to override the installed PostgreSQL systemd service file, and add accounting (and possibly resource limits) for the controllers of interest, for example:    
```    
CPUAccounting=yes    
MemoryAccounting=yes    
TasksAccounting=yes    
IOAccounting=yes    
IPAccounting=yes    
```    
Anyway, returning to the code snippet above, you can see that cgroup_path() is a set-returning function which returns the resolved paths to all of the cgroup controllers. The process count for the cgroup, which in Kubernetes-land corresponds to the Pod in which PostgreSQL is running, is given by the scalar function unsurprisingly named cgroup_process_count().    
Finally, the built-in PostgreSQL function current_setting() is used to inquire about the values of two key configuration parameters controlling behavior of the extension. These parameters have generally sensible defaults, and the extension attemps to override them as required by the host context at PostgreSQL startup (pgnodemx must be loaded via shared_preload_libraries), but if you need you can set these values in postgresql.conf yourself. Note that pgnodemx.cgroup_enabled = off can be used, and indeed is set by pgnodemx when required, in order to disable cgroup support entirely.    
Now let's look at some of the "General Access Functions". This set of examples shows how it is possible to read the current memory usage, the given memory limit, and the relevant CPU limits for the cgroup (Kubernetes Pod):    
```    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('memory.usage_in_bytes');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
            241020928

userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_float8('memory.usage_in_bytes');

--------------------    
 240971776    
(1 row)    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('memory.limit_in_bytes');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
            536870912    
(1 row)    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('cpu.cfs_period_us');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
               100000    
(1 row)    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('cpu.cfs_quota_us');    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
                10000    
(1 row)    
```    
In the snippet above, general access functions are shown that are designed to read cgroup virtual files that return a single row of a single scalar value. There are BIGINT, TEXT, and FLOAT8 variants of the scalar access type function. These functions will do their best to coerce the characters read from the virtual file into the matching data type. If the characters cannot be coerced, and ERROR will be returned.    
Next let's see some expected failure cases:    
```    
userdb=# -- should return NULL    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint(null);    
 cgroup_scalar_bigint     
----------------------    
(1 row)    
userdb=# -- should fail    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('bar/../../etc/memory.usage_in_bytes');    
ERROR:  reference to parent directory ("..") not allowed    
userdb=# -- should fail    
userdb=# SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('/memory.usage_in_bytes');    
ERROR:  reference to absolute path not allowed    
userdb=# CREATE USER pgnodemx_joe;    
CREATE ROLE    
userdb=# SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION pgnodemx_joe;    
SET    
userdb=> -- should fail    
userdb=> SELECT cgroup_scalar_bigint('memory.usage_in_bytes');    
ERROR:  must be member of pg_monitor role    
userdb=> RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION;    
RESET    
userdb=# DROP USER pgnodemx_joe;    
DROP ROLE    
```    
Here we see that bad arguments will result in either NULL (for NULL input) or an ERROR. Generally speaking the cgroup general access functions all take a virtual file name as an argument. The filename must not be NULL, and must not be absolute or parent referencing relative paths. Also, the invoking user must be a member of the built-in pg_monitor role (or an administrator created pgmonitor for PostgreSQL version 9.6 or earlier).    
There are several other types of general access functions. Rather than try to show them all here, please see the README and try out the extension for yourself. However at the risk of providing too much detail, one more example might be interesting:    
```

In this example there are two types of access functions: cgroup_setof_kv() and cgroup_setof_ksv(). These are appropriate when the cgroup virtual file contains multiple rows in key-value pairs or key-subkey-value triplets respectively. The snippet shows how it is possible to obtain fairly detailed information regarding CPU, memory, and I/O usage of the cgroup/Pod. Neat stuff if I do say so myself!    
Kubernetes Downward API Related Functions    
Let's skip over the other function types for the moment and touch on the Kubernetes Downward API related functions, because they are similar in some ways to the cgroup related functions. This API exposes Pod and Container information through both environment variables as well as "Volume Files". We'll discuss a set of generic functions for reading environment variables in the next section. In pgnodemx the Kubernetes Downward API support functions are specifically targeted at the "Volume Files". See the documentation linked above for details with respect to how to create those files and what information may be exposed. At least one interesting bit of info that is difficult to obtain otherwise is the Kubernetes "request" values for things like CPU and memory. Since these are not mapped directly to cgroup virtual files anyway (at least as far as I have been able to determine), this seems to be the only way to get that information via introspection from PostgreSQL.    
Enough talk, here are several code examples:    
```    
userdb=# SELECT * FROM kdapi_setof_kv('labels');    
         key          |                 val

Similar to the cgroup facility, pgnodemx.kdapi_enabled = off can be used, and indeed is set by pgnodemx when required, in order to disable Kubernetes Downward API support entirely.    
In the above code the use of set-returning function kdapi_setof_kv() and scalar function kdapi_scalar_bigint() are illustrated. The memory and CPU request values are easily obtained via this facility. There is also an example of reconstituting the status annotation from Kubernetes as a PostgreSQL jsonb value.    
Environment, /proc, and "Other" Functions    
As alluded to above, there are two provided functions for reading scalar environment variables and coercing them to an appropriate PostgreSQL data type: pgnodemx_envvar_text() and pgnodemx_envvar_bigint(). Their use is pretty straightforward and can be seen in the README.    
There are also several functions that read and parse specific /proc virtual files and return the information contained in a suitably mapped form. Their use is also shown in the documentation, so to keep this blog from becoming too obnoxiously long we'll ask you to "read the fine manual". However I would like to leave you with one more interesting query that combines two of the /proc functions with a general system information function, fsinfo(). This last function does not read from any virtual file but instead gets information directly from kernel syscalls. On second thought we will also look at one of the /proc functions. Without further ado:    
```    
userdb=# SELECT interface,    
                rx_bytes, rx_packets,

The first query here gives us network I/O on the available interfaces, while the second gives fairly comprehensive information about the file system on which our PostgreSQL data directory is mounted.
