### Introduction

When linearly polarized light is reflected by a retroreflector, the orientation of the polarized light is evenly distributed in all directions. Consequently, the polarizer will reduce the intensity of the reflected light by approximately 50%.

### Measurement Results

- **Normalized Reflected Energy vs. Area (cm²)**
  - **Equation:** \( y = 0.083x - 0.174 \)
  - **Range:** \( 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 \)

- **Normalized Reflected Energy vs. Distance (meters)**
  - **Equation:** \( y = 2.043x - 4.616 \)
  - **Range:** \( 10^{-3}, 10^{-2}, 10^{-1}, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \)

### Networked Operation

Our primary focus has been on the communication aspects of a single ViTag-ViReader pair. When multiple ViTags and ViReaders are within range, mechanisms for channel access arbitration are necessary. We have designed a simple query-response MAC protocol similar to that used in RFID systems, which was implemented in our second proof-of-concept application. Unlike passive RFID, the solar panel in our system can continuously harvest ambient light energy, allowing the device to initiate communication sessions with the reader. Therefore, the MAC protocol needs to be slightly modified to accommodate this new scenario. This part has been omitted due to space constraints.

### Related Work

**Passive VLC** is inspired by the concept of backscatter communication but uses visible light as the medium to achieve low-power communication.

#### Visible Light Communication Systems

Several efforts have explored using visible light as a communication medium. Most works either deal with one-way communication without an uplink [14, 24, 26, 45] or use battery-powered two-way communication [13, 16, 27], limiting their practicality. Specifically:

- **LED-to-Phone Systems** [25, 29, 39]: Support only downlink transmissions, aimed at phone localization.
- **LED-to-LED Systems** [40, 47]: Consider visible light networks where each end is not mobile and not battery-free.

Recently, the idea of visible light passive communication has been introduced and tested in [28, 41, 48]. For instance, RetroVLC [28] uses the existing indoor lighting infrastructure and retroreflector fabric to backscatter encoded information modulated by an LCD shutter, achieving 0.125 kbps using OOK modulation and Manchester coding. PassiveVLC builds on the RetroVLC framework and achieves 1 kbps (8 times over RetroVLC) using the same LCD shutter with an optimized trend-based modulation and code-assisted demodulation design. The work in [41] extends this idea by proposing a pixelated VLC backscatter, which uses multiple smaller reflectors and LCD shutters to form pixels, improving the link throughput from 200 bps to 600 bps with three pixels. However, this approach only works when the communication distance is fixed. In contrast, [48] embeds data as grayscale patterns into reflective surfaces, enabling an optical receiver to scan the time series of photodiode sensor readings from unmodulated ambient light signals for mobile data communication. PassiveVLC, however, can dynamically change the data sent on the reflecting link, making it more suitable for IoT applications.

#### Radio Backscatter Communication Systems

Backscattering provides transmission capability for extremely low-power devices, eliminating the need for active signal generation. This technique is primarily used in RFID tags [20, 44]. Recently, TV-based [31, 36] and Wi-Fi [11, 22, 23, 49] systems have also employed and advanced this technique. Our system shares the same design principles—achieving low-energy communication through a backscatter link. Although the current implementation of PassiveVLC is inferior to most radio backscatter systems in terms of transmission rate (1 kbps versus several kbps [18, 22, 31, 46, 50] and even orders of Mbps [11, 23, 36, 49]), it has several advantages:

- **Immunity to RF Interference:** PassiveVLC is based on visible light, making it immune to interference from the crowded RF spectrum.
- **Enhanced Security:** The use of retroreflectors constrains the uplink transmission to the tag-reader path, inherently providing good security properties. Other systems require additional efforts to enhance security [34, 51].

### Conclusion

This paper presents a comprehensive attempt to design, implement, evaluate, demonstrate, and understand a practical backscattering communication system using visible light. With the proposed trend-based modulation and code-assisted demodulation, we built a battery-free visible light backscatter tag achieving up to 1 kbps uplink data rate using commercially off-the-shelf retroreflector fabric and LCD shutter. While this technology is still in its infancy, we believe this paper sheds light on new ways of thinking about machine-to-machine communication in scenarios where battery-free, sniff-proof, biologically friendly, and spectrally efficient solutions are desired.
