3When the linearly polarized light is reflected by the retroreflector, the orientation of
the polarized light is evenly distributed in all directions. Therefore the polarizer will
decrease the reflected light intensity by about 50%.

Networked Operation. We have primarily focused on the com-
munication aspects of a single ViTag-ViReader pair. When many
of these devices (both ViTag and ViReader) are in range of each
other, we need mechanisms to arbitrate the channel access. We have
designed a simple query-response MAC similar to that of RFID and
applied in the second proof-of-concept application. Unlike RFID
which is completely passive, the solar panel can continuously har-
vest light energy from ambient light, it may initiate a communi-
cation session to the reader. Thus, the MAC needs to be slightly
modified to accommodate this new situation. We have omitted this
part for sake of space constraint.
9 RELATED WORK
PassiveVLC is inspired by the idea of (radio) backscatter communi-
cation but differ from that by using visible light as the medium to
achieve low power communication.
Visible Light Communication Systems. There have been many
efforts exploring communication mediums wherein visible lights
carry information. Most works, however, either deal with only one-
way communication without an uplink [14, 24, 26, 45], or go in a
two-way fashion with both sides supplied by battery [13, 16, 27],
which limit the practicality for real-world deployment. Specifically,
LED-to-phone systems [25, 29, 39] only support downlink transmis-
sions, targeted at phone localization. LED-to-LED systems [40, 47]
consider visible light networks, where each end is not meant to be
mobile, and is not battery-free. Until recently, the idea of visible
light passive communication has been introduced and exercised
in [28, 41, 48]. Specifically, by using the incoming light from the
existing indoor lighting infrastructure as the carrier, RetroVLC [28]
uses the retroreflector fabric to backscatter the encoded informa-
tion modulated by a LCD shutter and achieve 0.125 kbps using
OOK modulation and Manchester coding4. PassiveVLC is built on
the RetroVLC framework but achieves 1 kbps (8x over RetroVLC)
using the same LCD shutter based on an optimized trend-based
modulation and code-assisted demodulation design. The authors
in [41] extends this idea by proposing a pixelated VLC backscatter,
which uses multiple smaller reflectors and LCD shutters to form
numbers of pixels and improves the link throughput proportion-
ally from 200 bps to 600 bps by using three pixels. However, one
potential limitation is that it only works when the communica-
tion distance is fixed. On the other hand, instead of modulating
light sources, the author in [48] embed data as various grayscale
seamless patterns into reflective surface objects. An optical receiver
can leverage its relative mobility to the object to scan the time se-
ries of the photodiode sensor reading of the reflected optical pulse
from the unmodulated ambient light signals to realize mobile data
communication. PassiveVLC, by contrast, is able to dynamically
changes the data to send on the reflecting link and thus is more
suitable for IoT applications.
4This result is carried out by implementing RetroVLC on the same hardware as Pas-
siveVLC. The LCD used in RetroVLC [28] has a significantly shorter response time
and thus achieves 0.5 kbps.
Radio Backscatter Communication Systems. Backscattering
is a way to provide transmission capability for extremely low-power
devices, substituting the need for devices actively generating signals.
The technique has been primarily used by RFID tags [20, 44]. Re-
cently, TV-based [31, 36] and Wi-Fi [11, 22, 23, 49] systems started
employing and advancing this technique. Our system shares the
same design principles – achieve low energy communication by es-
tablishing a backscatter link. Although the current implementation
of PassiveVLC is inferior to most radio backscatter system in terms
of transmission rate (1 kbps versus several kbps [18, 22, 31, 46, 50]
and even orders of Mbps [11, 23, 36, 49]) by a few orders of mag-
nitude, our work has several advantages over RF-based approach
in general: First, PassiveVLC is based on visible light, and thus
completely immune to the interference from RF spectrum which is
already crowded with “default” LAN and PAN technologies such
as WiFi, BLE. Second, because of the backscattering nature, these
RF-based systems tend to expose their transmissions to a wide sur-
rounding area, leaving a good chance for side readers to overhear
the information being transmitted. In contrast, ViTag relies on VLC,
which implies that eavesdroppers are easily discernible. The use
of retroreflectors further constraints the uplink transmission to
stick along the tag-reader path. As a result, PassiveVLC comes with
a good security property inherently, while other systems have to
enhance their security with extra efforts [34, 51].
10 CONCLUSION
This paper present a first comprehensive attempt to the design,
implementation, evaluation, demonstration and understanding of
a practical backscattering communication system exploiting the
visible light medium. With the proposed trend-based modulation
and code-assisted demodulation design, we built a battery-free
visible light backscatter tag and achieved up to 1 kbps uplink data
rate, using commercially off-the-shelf retroreflector fabric and LCD
shutter. While this technology is still in its infant stage, we believe
this paper sheds light on new ways of thinking machine to machine
communication in those scenarios where battery-free, sniff-proof,
biologically friendly and spectral efficiency are much desired.
