Figure 3: Evolution of number of proof-of-earnings using
Amazon Gift Cards (AGC) and PayPal.
Amazon Gift Cards and PayPal are by far the most used payment
platforms used for eWhoring, with 934 and 795 images respectively.
We also observe 35 images showing Bitcoin exchanges. The ex-
change of Amazon Gift Cards on underground forums has increased
in recent years [27]. We observe similar patterns in eWhoring. Fig-
ure 3 shows the number of images using Amazon Gift Cards and
PayPal per month. Since 2016, Amazon has become the preferred
payment platform for eWhoring.
We also analysed 9 066 threads in the Currency Exchange board
made by 686 eWhoring actors. Recall we only consider in this anal-
ysis those actors with more than 50 posts related to eWhoring, and
only include threads in Currency Exchange made after the actors
started in eWhoring. Table 7 shows the number of threads asking
for and offering Amazon Gift Cards (AGC), PayPal and Bitcoin
(the top 3 currencies on offer). There is a notable difference be-
tween Amazon Gift Cards offered (1 498) and wanted (310). Bitcoin
is the most wanted currency, suggesting actors use the Currency
Exchange board for exchanging eWhoring profits into Bitcoin. We
assume the Bitcoin on offer are not eWhoring profits, as these are
relatively uncommon. Indeed, the eWhoring community discour-
ages requesting payment in Bitcoin, as customers are unlikely to
hold this currency [19].

6 ANALYSIS OF EWHORING ACTORS
In this section we analyse the social relations and features of actors
involved in eWhoring. We first present the techniques used for
analysing the actors who are involved and then provide a general
overview of them. We then focus on the key actors, namely those
who are particularly interesting due to their characteristics and the
types of activities they are involved in. This part of the study fo-
cuses on Hackforums, the underground forum containing the largest
community for eWhoring (see Table 1). We use previous, current
and posterior forum activity to analyse the pathways followed by
key actors, including the other interests they exhibit during their
interactions on the forum.
6.1 Social network and feature extraction
To analyse the social interactions between forum members, we
built a network from the public conversations of members in the
forum, i.e. who responded to whom in the threads. We consider
actor A has responded to actor B if either A explicitly quotes a
post made by B in a reply or if A directly posts a reply in a thread
initiated by B, without quoting any other post. We account for
all the interactions between forum members in threads related to
eWhoring. We built a social graph where nodes correspond with
forum actors and edges are the interactions between them, weighted
by the number of responses. We also computed popularity metrics
based on the replies to threads initiated by actors. These include
a H-index (a metric widely use to measure popularity of scholars,
which indicates that an actor has H threads with at least H replies),
and the i-10, i-50 and i-100 indices (i.e., the number of threads with
at least 10, 50, or 100 replies).
Additionally, for each actor we get the date when the first and
last eWhoring-related posts were made, as well as the registration
date and the date of the last activity in each forum. This allows
us to analyse previous and posterior activity of the actors in the
forum. We also account for the total number of posts made in both
eWhoring and other sections to analyse whether actors are exclu-
sively using the forums for eWhoring, or if they are also interested
in other boards. We note some other forum activities might still be
related to eWhoring, e.g., actors might post in Currency Exchange
boards to cash out their eWhoring earnings.
To analyse the interests of forum users, we follow a similar
approach used in previous work [25, 27]. We leverage various cate-
gories defined in Hackforums (e.g., Hacking, Coding, Marketplace,
etc.), and then construct the interest of a user A in a category C by
counting the number of posts and threads made by A in the boards
included in C. Accordingly, we analyse the interest of various ac-
tors before, during and after their interaction with the eWhoring
community (we note some actors only interact with the eWhoring
community, so they do not have interests before or after).

ing.
6.2 Overview of actors
As shown in Table 8, we found nearly 73k actors discussing eWhor-
ing in our dataset, i.e., they made at least one post in an eWhoring-
related conversation. On average these 73k actors made 8.8 posts,
and only 22% of their activity relates to eWhoring. Table 8 groups ac-
tors based on the number of eWhoring-related posts. The columns
show the number of actors, the average number of posts per actor,
the percentage of posts that are eWhoring-related, and the number
of days they were active in the forum before and after their interac-
tion with the eWhoring community. Figure 4 shows the Cumulative
Distribution Frequency (CDF) for these metrics. Of the nearly 73k
actors posting in eWhoring, around 2k made more than 50 posts,
with only 46 actors making more than 500 posts.
Actors usually spend some time in the forum before interacting
with eWhoring communities. Overall, actors spend around 6 months
(165.3 days) before their first eWhoring-related post. Five of the
most actively posting actors (those with more than 1k posts) spent
more than 1 year before starting eWhoring. We observe that as
users write more posts related to eWhoring, the average time spent
in other sections is reduced. Also, those that make more eWhoring-
related posts have a lower percentage of posts elsewhere on the
forum. Thus, actors who are most active in eWhoring are more
focused and have less interest in other activities.
6.3 Analysing key actors
In this section we analyse a subset of actors that are of interest due
to their activities in the eWhoring community.
Definition of key actors. We focus on actors that are of interest
for a variety of reasons, such as their popularity or level of reported
income generated through eWhoring. We refer to these members
as key actors. We use a rank-based selection, where a subset of top-
rated users for each category are selected for analysis. We identify
key actors based on the following five categories:
• Actors offering packs. In total, there are 2 523 actors who
have offered packs. Of these, we select 63 actors who have
shared at least 6 packs. Together, they shared a total of 554
packs (nearly 13.5% of all packs shared in Hackforums).
• Actors reporting substantial earnings. We rely on the self-
reported proof-of-earnings to get a lower-bound estimate
of the earnings made through eWhoring. Of the 661 actors
posting proof-of-earnings, we include in our set of key actors

the 50 highest earners. These actors claim a total of US$283k,
which accounts for 55.5% of reported earnings.
• Popular actors. We identify the actors who are more popular
in the community by selecting the 50 users with the highest
H-index.
• Actors requesting currency exchange. We identify actors that
started posting in the Currency Exchange board of Hackfo-
rums after first posting in eWhoring. We count the number
of threads before and after their first eWhoring post. We cal-
culate the percentage of threads made in Currency Exchange
since they started eWhoring, and multiply this by the total
amount of threads. Users are sorted by the resulting score,
with the top 50 selected as key actors.
• Influencing actors. We leverage the social network of inter-
actions. We calculate the eigenvector centrality, which is a
metric indicating the influence of each node in the network.
We select the 50 users with the highest eigenvector values.
Selection of key actors. The intersection of the previous groups
resulted in a final set of 195 key actors. Some actors belong to more
than one group. Specifically, 4 actors belong to 4 groups: they are
popular, influencing, offer packs and report substantial earnings.
There are 16 actors from 3 groups, 14 of them are influencing and
popular actors (with 9 offering packs, 4 asking for currency ex-
change and 1 reporting substantial earnings), one belongs to the
influencing, pack offering, and earning groups; and the last one be-
longs to the currency exchange, popular and offering packs groups.
Finally, there are 24 actors from 2 groups. The intersection between
each pair of groups is shown in Table 9. The diagonal represents the
number of actors unique to each category. The highest intersection
is between popular and influencing actors, with 26 actors belonging
to both groups. A total of 20 actors offering packs are also popular,
which suggests users might offer packs for free to increase their
