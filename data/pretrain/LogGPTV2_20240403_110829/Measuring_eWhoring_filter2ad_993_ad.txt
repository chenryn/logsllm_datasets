### Evolution of Proof-of-Earnings Using Amazon Gift Cards and PayPal

Figure 3 illustrates the evolution of proof-of-earnings using Amazon Gift Cards (AGC) and PayPal. These two payment platforms are the most frequently used in eWhoring, with 934 and 795 images, respectively. Additionally, 35 images show Bitcoin exchanges. The use of Amazon Gift Cards on underground forums has increased in recent years [27], a trend also observed in eWhoring. Figure 3 displays the number of images using AGCs and PayPal per month. Since 2016, Amazon has become the preferred payment platform for eWhoring.

### Analysis of Currency Exchange Threads

We analyzed 9,066 threads in the Currency Exchange board made by 686 eWhoring actors. Only actors with more than 50 posts related to eWhoring were considered, and only threads created after they started eWhoring were included. Table 7 shows the number of threads asking for and offering AGCs, PayPal, and Bitcoin (the top three currencies). There is a notable difference between AGCs offered (1,498) and wanted (310). Bitcoin is the most desired currency, suggesting that actors use the Currency Exchange board to convert eWhoring profits into Bitcoin. We assume that the Bitcoin offered is not from eWhoring profits, as these are relatively uncommon. The eWhoring community discourages requesting payment in Bitcoin, as customers are unlikely to hold this currency [19].

| Currency | Offered | Wanted |
|----------|---------|--------|
| PayPal   | 2,763   | 4,626  |
| BTC      | 3,707   | 2,801  |
| AGC      | 1,498   | 310    |
| Others   | 259     | 201    |
| Total    | 9,066   | 9,066  |

### Analysis of eWhoring Actors

In this section, we analyze the social relations and features of actors involved in eWhoring. We first present the techniques used for analyzing the actors, followed by a general overview of them. We then focus on key actors, those who are particularly interesting due to their characteristics and activities. This part of the study focuses on Hackforums, the underground forum with the largest eWhoring community (see Table 1). We use previous, current, and posterior forum activity to analyze the pathways followed by key actors, including other interests they exhibit during their interactions on the forum.

#### Social Network and Feature Extraction

To analyze social interactions between forum members, we constructed a network from public conversations, i.e., who responded to whom in the threads. An actor A is considered to have responded to actor B if A explicitly quotes a post by B or directly replies in a thread initiated by B without quoting any other post. We account for all interactions in eWhoring-related threads and built a social graph where nodes represent forum actors and edges represent interactions, weighted by the number of responses. We also computed popularity metrics, including H-index (a metric widely used to measure the popularity of scholars, indicating that an actor has H threads with at least H replies), and i-10, i-50, and i-100 indices (the number of threads with at least 10, 50, or 100 replies).

Additionally, for each actor, we recorded the dates of the first and last eWhoring-related posts, registration date, and the date of the last activity in each forum. This allows us to analyze their previous and posterior activity. We also accounted for the total number of posts in both eWhoring and other sections to determine if actors are exclusively using the forums for eWhoring or if they are interested in other boards. Some other forum activities might still be related to eWhoring, such as posting in Currency Exchange boards to cash out earnings.

To analyze the interests of forum users, we followed a similar approach used in previous work [25, 27]. We leveraged various categories defined in Hackforums (e.g., Hacking, Coding, Marketplace) and constructed the interest of a user A in a category C by counting the number of posts and threads made by A in the boards included in C. We analyzed the interests of various actors before, during, and after their interaction with the eWhoring community.

#### Overview of Actors

As shown in Table 8, we found nearly 73,000 actors discussing eWhoring in our dataset, with each making at least one post in an eWhoring-related conversation. On average, these actors made 8.8 posts, and only 22% of their activity was related to eWhoring. Table 8 groups actors based on the number of eWhoring-related posts, showing the number of actors, the average number of posts per actor, the percentage of posts that are eWhoring-related, and the number of days they were active in the forum before and after their interaction with the eWhoring community. Figure 4 shows the Cumulative Distribution Frequency (CDF) for these metrics. Of the nearly 73,000 actors, around 2,000 made more than 50 posts, with only 46 actors making more than 500 posts.

| #Posts | ≥ 1 | ≥ 10 | ≥ 50 | ≥ 100 | ≥ 200 | ≥ 500 | ≥ 1,000 |
|--------|-----|------|------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| #Actors | 72,982 | 13,014 | 2,146 | 815 | 263 | 46 | 13 |
| Avg. posts | 474.2 | 449.7 | 293.8 | 210.1 | 165.7 | 157.8 | 137.3 |
| %ewhor. | 8.8 | 37.6 | 126.9 | 222.4 | 402.3 | 930.8 | 1566.8 |
| Before | 165.3 | 142.7 | 133.8 | 132.8 | 153.6 | 157.4 | 412.6 |
| After | 23.3 | 22.8 | 26.0 | 29.1 | 34.9 | 40.6 | 37.5 |

**Table 8: Number of actors, mean posts made, percentage made in eWhoring, and mean days posting before and after eWhoring, grouped by the number of posts made in eWhoring.**

Actors usually spend some time in the forum before interacting with eWhoring communities. Overall, actors spend around 6 months (165.3 days) before their first eWhoring-related post. Five of the most active actors (those with more than 1,000 posts) spent more than 1 year before starting eWhoring. As users write more posts related to eWhoring, the average time spent in other sections is reduced. Actors who make more eWhoring-related posts have a lower percentage of posts elsewhere on the forum, indicating that the most active eWhoring actors are more focused and have less interest in other activities.

#### Analyzing Key Actors

In this section, we analyze a subset of actors who are of interest due to their activities in the eWhoring community.

**Definition of Key Actors:**
We focus on actors who are of interest for various reasons, such as their popularity or reported income generated through eWhoring. These members are referred to as key actors. We use a rank-based selection, where a subset of top-rated users for each category is selected for analysis. Key actors are identified based on the following five categories:

- **Actors Offering Packs:** In total, there are 2,523 actors who have offered packs. We selected 63 actors who have shared at least 6 packs, together sharing a total of 554 packs (nearly 13.5% of all packs shared in Hackforums).
- **Actors Reporting Substantial Earnings:** We rely on self-reported proof-of-earnings to estimate the earnings made through eWhoring. Of the 661 actors posting proof-of-earnings, we include the 50 highest earners, who claim a total of US$283k, accounting for 55.5% of reported earnings.
- **Popular Actors:** We identify the most popular actors by selecting the 50 users with the highest H-index.
- **Actors Requesting Currency Exchange:** We identify actors who started posting in the Currency Exchange board after their first eWhoring post. We count the number of threads before and after their first eWhoring post, calculate the percentage of threads made in Currency Exchange since they started eWhoring, and select the top 50 based on the resulting score.
- **Influencing Actors:** We leverage the social network of interactions, calculating the eigenvector centrality, which indicates the influence of each node in the network. We select the 50 users with the highest eigenvector values.

**Selection of Key Actors:**
The intersection of the previous groups resulted in a final set of 195 key actors. Some actors belong to more than one group. Specifically, 4 actors belong to 4 groups: they are popular, influencing, offer packs, and report substantial earnings. There are 16 actors from 3 groups, 14 of them are influencing and popular actors (with 9 offering packs, 4 asking for currency exchange, and 1 reporting substantial earnings), one belongs to the influencing, pack offering, and earning groups; and the last one belongs to the currency exchange, popular, and offering packs groups. Finally, there are 24 actors from 2 groups. The intersection between each pair of groups is shown in Table 9. The diagonal represents the number of actors unique to each category. The highest intersection is between popular and influencing actors, with 26 actors belonging to both groups. A total of 20 actors offering packs are also popular, suggesting that users might offer packs for free to increase their visibility and influence.

**Table 9: Intersection of Key Actor Groups**

| Group | #Posts | %eWhoring | Days before | P | I | Hi | $ | Ce | ALL |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|---|---|----|---|----|-----|
|       | 1,089.9 | 895.3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
