User: I have a python script that running on windows server 2008 on cmd line. I don't need any interact during script running. By the way the script is running during about a week. So if the server disconnects my connection for some reason, my script stops and I have to start over and over again. It is huge trouble for me and I don't know how to solve this problem.
Here is my question.
How to run a python script in backround on windows server even user disconnect from the server?
Thanks in advance for your help.
Assistant: try to spin up an AWS instance and run it on a more reliable server. Or you can look into hadoop to process the code across multiple fail-safe servers
