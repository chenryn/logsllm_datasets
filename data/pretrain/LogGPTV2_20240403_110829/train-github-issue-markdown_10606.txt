Firstly, I would like to commend the excellent integration in `package.json`, which includes support for the Schema Store and autocompletion for server packages.

I have noticed that the default NPM registry is hardcoded, even when a custom registry has been set using `npm config set registry`.

Is there a way to use a user-specified registry instead of the default one? Additionally, does the JavaScript extension offer any extensibility or customization options to address this?
