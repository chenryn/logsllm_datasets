First of all, congratulations for such a nice integration in package.json,
with Schema Store support and server packages autocomplete.
I noted here that NPM's default registry is hardcoded, even if a custom
registry was set by `npm config set registry`.
Is there any possible way to use a registry provided by the user instead of
the default one? Does JavaScript extension even provide any extensibility or
customization at this point?
