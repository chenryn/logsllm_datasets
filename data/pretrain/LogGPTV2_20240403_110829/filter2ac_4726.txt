**ATT&CK Technique Name:** RC Scripts

Adversaries may establish persistence on a Unix-like system by modifying RC (Run Command) scripts, which are executed during the system's startup process. These scripts allow system administrators to define and start custom services for different run levels. To modify these RC scripts, an adversary would need root-level privileges.

### Explanation:
- **RC Scripts**: These are configuration files that control the startup and shutdown processes of a Unix-like system. They are typically located in directories such as `/etc/rc.d/` or `/etc/init.d/`.
- **Persistence**: By altering these scripts, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code or services are executed every time the system boots up, thus maintaining long-term access.
- **Root Privileges**: Modifying RC scripts requires elevated permissions, specifically root access, because they control critical system functions.

This technique is a common method for achieving persistence, as it leverages the system's built-in mechanisms for managing startup processes.
