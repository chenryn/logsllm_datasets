Calling `electron.ipcRenderer.sendSync()` within a `drop` event handler causes
odd behavior with `dragEnd` event handlers.
Given this code in a `BrowserWindow`:
When the blue box is dragged to the red box, the console shows:
    DROP (1)
    DRAG END (3)
    DROP (2)
Workaround: avoid calling IPC in drag/drop event handlers.
FWIW: this appeared for us as a bunch of React and ReactDnD invariant
violations. We were calling `remote.getGlobal` from a React `render` method,
and causing a re-render from a `drop` handler.
