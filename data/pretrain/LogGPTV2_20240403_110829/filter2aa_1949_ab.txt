### IEEE 802.11b and MAC Addresses

IEEE 802.11b uses a 48-bit address to identify the link-layer network interface [12]. This address, also known as the Media Access Control (MAC) address, is typically set by the hardware manufacturer but can be configured from the operating system if the device driver supports it.

The MAC address serves to uniquely identify devices on a network. The first 24 bits of the address represent the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), assigned by the IEEE. The remaining 24 bits are determined by the specific vendor organization.

### Identifying Contaminated Devices

Manufacturers can use the 8 bits following the OUI to indicate a contaminated device. This allows packet capture software to easily identify such devices within the coverage area of a radio device.

### Secure Communication and Key Encoding

In secure communication protocols, the secret key (Ks) is encoded with additional information, such as the type of key, the session or user it refers to, and other necessary details. This information is then encrypted using an encryption scheme and a global key known only to the attacker. A simple example of this scheme involves using the XOR operation with the first applicable bits of the MAC address to generate the network interface identifier for an IPv6 address:

\[ Ks \oplus \text{MAC address} = \text{interface id} \]

This operation helps to hide the key from unauthorized users who do not know the encoding scheme.

### Detection and Exploitation

Vendor agents maintain a database of contaminated devices on their laptops. These laptops automatically recognize contaminated devices when scanning WLAN radio frequencies. Upon detection, the laptops record IP and higher-level communications, including IPv6 addresses. The IPv6 address contains the secret key, which can be used to decrypt the encrypted communication. For secret keys larger than 64 bits, a similar encoding scheme can be used, requiring multiple stateless address autoconfiguration procedures to protect user privacy. However, depending on the key length and encoding scheme, a single address may suffice, and the remaining bits of the key can be revealed through a brute force attack.

### Malware and Privacy Risks

This scenario can be exploited by rootkit malware, potentially received via email. The malware checks the MAC address of the device and contaminates the operating system, sending the MAC address to the attacker's computer. This allows the attacker to track the correct traffic in the radio network. However, this method requires sending the MAC address, making it more detectable compared to exploitation by the hardware manufacturer.

### Conclusions

IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) can be inherently harmful to user privacy. It either:
1. Introduces the risk that all traffic originating from the host in different places can be linked to the user.
2. Provides a way to divulge sensitive information about the user or even the secret keys of encrypted communication.

The IPv6 address as a covert channel is a significant threat because it exists in every packet, even if the payload is protected by IPsec ESP. Most computers lack sophisticated intrusion detection systems, and even if they do, most users cannot effectively use them. However, networks where users reside may have intrusion detection systems that monitor traffic. Thus, while opening a new connection to divulge sensitive information or secret keys might be noticed, the covert channel scheme in IPv6 addresses often goes undetected.

### Mitigation Strategies

A straightforward countermeasure is to disallow stateless address autoconfiguration and instead use stateful server-based assignment, such as DHCPv6 [5], which mitigates the problem effectively. However, this is not feasible for ad hoc networks, limiting the applicability of this mitigation. Additionally, DHCPv6 may introduce administrative burdens that SLAAC aims to alleviate.

The SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) [3] protocol has been proposed to replace the Neighbor Discovery protocol. SEND uses Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA) [4], which mitigate many attacks against Neighbor Discovery and stateless address autoconfiguration. CGA ensures that the interface identifier is a host identifier, with a public/private key pair and a hash of the public key used in the IPv6 address interface identifier. While CGA seems to mitigate the use of addresses as covert channels, an attacker can pre-create key pairs that hash to a desired string, allowing them to still use the address field for covert communication.
