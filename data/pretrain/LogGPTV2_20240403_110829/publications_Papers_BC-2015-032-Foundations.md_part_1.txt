#### Summary
This chapter begins by presenting evidence of the growing importance of services in our society, a trend reinforced by recent technological and economic developments. It then provides a detailed definition and discussion of services to explain their fundamental principles. Concepts from operations management are used to describe services as transformation processes involving resources from both customers and providers. The final section contrasts services with goods and investigates the differences in marketing and management of these distinct economic commodities.

#### Learning Objectives
1. Identify the recent developments that have enabled the expansion of the service sector and its most predominant service industries.
2. Explain the concept of service and analyze the various types of interactions that can occur during service delivery.
3. Apply the I-T-O model from operations management to analyze and understand a service system.
4. Compare the main characteristics that make services and goods fundamentally different and explain how they can be bundled into one unique offering.

#### Opening Case: Services in the Clothing Industry
**From Made-to-Measure Customization to Mass Production... to Mass Customization**

In the pre-industrial era, obtaining a new dress was a personal experience. In a collaborative, face-to-face process, the tailor and his assistant would take measurements while the customer expressed her wishes and desires. Together, they would select fabrics, colors, and patterns. The tailor would then begin cutting and sewing, possibly requiring additional fittings, until the final product was delivered.

Today, only a few people can afford custom-tailored dresses or suits. Clothes are typically pre-fabricated in large quantities and sold ready-to-wear in fashion boutiques or department stores. Even if occasionally assisted by store personnel, the customer is largely in a self-service mode, looking for sizes, assessing qualities, trying on clothes, and making the final choice.

**Why Study Services?**
An example from the clothing industry…

**Figure 1.1: From Customization to Mass Production to Mass Customization**

Mass production resulted in affordable prices at the cost of standardized products with limited choice. With the advent of intelligent manufacturing and information technologies, mass production evolved into what is called mass customization—the production of individualized and personalized products in large volumes.

**Figure 1.2: The Design Studio Configurator of YouTailor**

IT-enabled mass customization is the most recent evolution in the information age, providing innovative services to shoppers to enable them to customize their products with a range of options, such as when ordering clothing, a car, or a computer (Figure 1.1.c). The use of web-based configurators, which emerged in the late 2000s, made it possible to deliver customized products manufactured by well-established production processes. Shoppers can use web-based configurators to indirectly and dynamically program robotic systems that can switch between clothing models and variants with little loss of efficiency and at a low cost.

For example, youtailor.de (Figure 1.2) provides an effective online customizing tool—the Designer Studio, which allows shoppers to easily design their shirts according to exact preferences. It is possible to choose from more than 10 configuration parameters (e.g., fabric, fit, buttons, color, style). The visual representation is 3D to enable customers to "see" the final product.

The three situations depicted in Figure 1.1 perfectly symbolize the historical development of services over the last centuries: all started with highly individualized, face-to-face services, evolved into highly standardized, customer-anonymous self-services, and has now reached a stage that can combine the advantages of the previous two: highly individualized and personalized electronic services.

### 1.1 Service-Oriented Societies

Intense competition among economies and the globalization of worldwide markets, in conjunction with the generalization and expansion of information systems and information technologies, have opened up significant opportunities for the conception of new specialized services. Providers are focusing on services for increased differentiation and creation of consumer value as a source of competitive advantage. In the age of information technology, traditional trading processes involving close and intense human interaction are often inadequate and can become a burden for companies competing in a globalized world.

#### 1.1.1 Recent Developments
The rapid dissemination of services in society is visible at various levels.

- **Service Economies**: Agriculture and manufacturing used to be the major productive elements of the world’s economies. Nowadays, services are the new fundamental element driving economies to grow. Services represent 80% of the US economy and account for more than 50% of the economies in countries such as Brazil, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the UK [1].
  
- **Service-Dominant (S-D) Logic**: Recent theoretical contributions, such as S-D Logic [2], indicate that all markets are centered on the exchange of services, and all economies and societies are service-based. It views service as the focus of economic and social exchange.

- **Electronic Services**: Several governments have already decided to invest in strategies to provide public services online in a systematic manner. For example, the UK government launched the Government Digital Service (GDS) initiative. The “Digital by Default” strategy was implemented in April 2014. The New Zealand government has followed the same path and is also making their services available online in a digital form (beta.govt.nz).

- **Mobile Services**: There is an increasing use of services from mobile devices. From Facebook to Dropbox to Gmail and beyond, most people use one or more mobile services in their personal lives. Mobile services are also entering the agenda of companies to improve the efficiency of employees, as a new marketing and delivery channel, and as a form to create new disruptive business models.

- **Cloud Services**: Companies are using cloud services, which use the utility model, to outsource their applications, development platforms, and infrastructures. The main driving factors include cost reduction and the scalability offered. Important cloud computing companies include Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Rackspace. Global Software as a Service (SaaS) revenues are forecasted to reach $106B in 2016, increasing 21% over projected 2015 spending levels [3].

- **Service Marketplaces**: Several service marketplaces—such as ServiceMagic.com, Sears’ ServiceLive.com, ServiceAlley.com, and RedBeacon.com—are growing very quickly to enable consumers to find local services through the internet. The value of this type of marketplace is attracting the attention of large companies. For example, RedBeacon.com, a platform that lets users search, browse, and hire local home service providers such as painters and house cleaners, was acquired in 2012 by The Home Depot, the largest home improvement retailer in the US.

Although many of these developments are recent, they are already having a positive impact on society. Consequently, more progress is needed in developing new theories, systematic methods, and tools for service innovation, design, implementation, analysis, and optimization, to name a few.

#### 1.1.2 Services Sector Growth
In 2005, the concept of service acquired renewed importance after several years of public debate, the European Parliament approved the service directive [4]. This directive intended to enhance competition by removing restrictions on cross-border market access for services in Europe. The implications of this measure for businesses and the IT community are enormous since the service sector represents more than 70% of the Gross National Product (GNP) of EU countries, and the directive can amplify the consumption of services in the European Union by 0.6% (€37 billion) [5].

Between 1997 and 2007, the growth among OECD member countries of service imports was highest in Ireland and was also well above average in Greece, Luxembourg, and Poland. Imports of services grew relatively slowly in Japan. In the same period, the growth rate of service exports for Ireland was again well above average, and a relatively high growth was also recorded for Luxembourg and Denmark. A rather low relative growth occurred in Turkey, Mexico, and France. Averaged over the last three years, the trade in services was relatively balanced for most countries, but large surpluses were recorded for the US and UK, and substantial deficits occurred in Germany and Japan. The fastest-growing services in OECD exports are now insurance and computer and information services, and for imports, insurance and government services. The slowest-growing export category has been construction services.

In the UK, since 16 years, new businesses ranging from restaurants to law firms have expanded at the sharpest rate. In 2013, the UK service sector growth reached a six-year high [The Independent, 04.09.2013].

In most countries, one of the largest and most important providers of services is the government, which operates in sectors such as water management, public safety, and basic healthcare.

Cost reduction and flexibility are often two main arguments for studying services from a scientific perspective. For example, in Denmark, the use of various channels to deliver a service has the following costs per transaction [6]: electronic services and self-service €4.2; telephone calls €7.8; emails received €11; letters (paper) €11.7; personal services (face-to-face) €14.

The economic value and importance of services raise the question, "How can science and research provide a solution to create services with higher quality?" Since the internet and the web are now an integral part of the fabric of worldwide societies, economies, and commerce, they can intuitively provide a fundamental infrastructure to enable the realization of the Internet of Services (see Chapter 2).
