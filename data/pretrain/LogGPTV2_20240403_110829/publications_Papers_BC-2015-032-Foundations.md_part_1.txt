TOMASSCUSTOMIZATION
In the pre-industrial era, getting a new dress was a personal experience. In a
collaborativeface-to-faceprocess,thetailorandhisassistanttookmeasurement,
while the customer formulated her wishes and desires. Together they selected
fabrics,colors,andpatterns. Thenthetailorwouldstartthecuttingandsewing,
possiblyrequiringadditionalfittings,untilthefinalproductcouldbedelivered.

Serviceeconomies Agricultureandmanufacturingusedtobethemajorproduc-
tive elements of the world’s economies. Nowadays, services are the new
fundamentalelementdrivingeconomiestogrow. Servicesrepresent80%
of the US economy and account for more than 50% of the economies in
countriessuchasBrazil,Germany,Japan,Russia,andtheUK[1].
Service-Dominant(S-D)Logic Recent theoretical contributions, such as S-D
Logic [2], indicate that all markets are centered on the exchange of ser-
vices,andalleconomiesandsocietiesareservicebased. Itviewsserviceas
thefocusofeconomicandsocialexchange.
Electronicservices Severalgovernmentshavealreadymadethedecisiontoinvest
instrategiestoprovidepublicservicesonlineinasystematicmanner. For
example, the UK government launched the Government Digital Service
(GDS)initiative. The“DigitalbyDefault”strategywasimplementedinApril
2014. TheNewZealandgovernmenthasfollowedthesamepathandisalso
makingtheirservicesonlineinadigitalform(beta.govt.nz).
Mobileservices Thereisanincreasinguseofservicesfrommobiledevices. From
FacebooktoDropboxtoGMailandbeyond,mostpeopleuseoneormore
mobile services in their personal lives. Mobile services are also entering
theagendaofcompaniestoimprovetheefficiencyofemployees,asanew
marketing and delivery channel, and as a form to create new disruptive
businessmodels.
