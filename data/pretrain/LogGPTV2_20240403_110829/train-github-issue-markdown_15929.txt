    $ cat x.go
    package p
    type T interface{
        _()
        _()
    }
    $ go tool 6g x.go
    x.go:6: internal compiler error: sigcmp vs sortinter _ _
    It's inclear what a compiler should do, and the spec is silent. See spec issue #6604.
    Once 6604 is resolved, this should be fixed.
    For the reference: gccgo reports a duplicate method error which is peculiar since we
    never report duplicates of _ objects. For instance, in structs we count on being able to
    define multiple _ fields.
