User: Please provide a data center configuration list, including server model, quantity, CPU, memory, and storage information.
Assistant: Sorry, due to limitations of the Q&A model, I cannot provide an exact list of data center configurations. However, the configuration of a data center will vary according to its size and business needs. To give you a general impression, here is a list of possible configurations for a small data center: - Server model: Dell PowerEdge R740 - Quantity: 20 - CPU: Intel Xeon Silver 4114 Processor 2.2GHz, 10 cores, 20 threads - Memory: 256GB DDR4 ECC RDIMM Memory (per server) - Storage: 3.2TB NVMe PCIe SSD (per server) - Network: 10GbE NIC (per server) - Switches: Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches - Storage: EMC XtremIO X2 All Flash Storage system - Cabinet: 42U standard cabinet - Others: UPS, power distribution cabinet, refrigeration equipment, etc. It should be noted that the above list is for reference only. The configuration list of the data center will be affected by many factors, such as data center scale, application load, guarantee level, scalability, etc. If you need configuration advice for a specific data center, it is best to consult a professional data center design and construction company.
