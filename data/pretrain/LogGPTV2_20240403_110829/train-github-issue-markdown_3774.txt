This is not a bug request, but rather, it's a discussion on the reasons why
you named 2 prop types of `TextField` almost the same with one being upper
case.  
According to TextField API,  
`TextField` exposes two prop types with almost same names. `InputProps` and
`inputProps`.  
Currently, my Eslint gives me an error for having duplicate prop type.  
Is there any reason to name 2 prop types almost the same?  
Can't we rename 1 of them to something more clarifying?  
This also gives headaches with linting tools.
## Expected Behavior
Eslint or any other linting tool doesn't give me any duplicate
error.(`react/jsx-no-duplicate-props`).
## Current Behavior
Eslint throwing duplicate prop error.
Plugin is located here.
##Temporal solution  
Yes, you can set `ignoreCase` to false in `.eslintrc` but isn't it better to
name our props in a more definitive way?  
Thank you.
