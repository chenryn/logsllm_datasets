User: How to use Nmap to scan hosts in the LAN?
Assistant: Nmap is a very powerful network scanning tool that can help users quickly scan hosts in the network and obtain detailed information about these hosts. The following are the steps to use Nmap to scan hosts in the LAN: 1. Determine the IP address range of the local network. For example, if your local network has an IP address range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254, you can use the following command to scan all hosts on that network: nmap 192.168.1.1-254 2. If you only want to scan a specific If you want Nmap to use more options and parameters when scanning, you can use the following command: nmap -sP 192.168.1.1- 254 The -sP option means to use a ping scan to determine which hosts are running. This will perform a ping test on each host to see if it is running. 4. Wait for the scan to complete. Nmap will display the progress and results of the scan. Scan time depends on the size and accessibility of your network, and the scan options you choose. 5. Analyze the scan results. Nmap will include IP addresses of all discovered hosts, hostnames and some other information such as OS type, applications and ports. You can use this information to identify potential problems on your network, such as unauthorized devices or open ports.
