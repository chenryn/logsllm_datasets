control law, the error distribution is unchanged, thus ensuring
that an attacker cannot implicate a non-attacker in the attack.
The anomaly detection approach of Zhao and Saligrama
[38], which is based on k-nearest neighbor (K-NN) graphs, is
used to determine whether di(t) deviates from an expected
error distribution. At each sampling instance vehicles report
their position, which is corroborated via secure localization
[39]–[41], to the infrastructure. From the position data the ﬁrst
and second order ﬁnite difference equations [42], of error order
four, are used to calculate vehicle velocities and accelerations,
respectively. Assuming that errors in vehicle position estimates
are ∼ N (0, σ), we would expect that di ∼ N (0, 4.76σ).
This approach is complicated, however, by the fact that
instability caused by the attackers will lead to ui(t) much
higher than a vehicle is actually capable of accelerating at;
i.e. di (cid:2) N (0, 4.76σ) even for non-attacker vehicles. We term
the point in time at which a vehicle ﬁrst encounters a ui(t)
greater/less than some nominal acceleration/deceleration limits
the saturation point, ηi. Thus, in order to prevent the false
identiﬁcation of non-attackers as attackers, we augment the
above procedure to only examine sample points before satura-
tion is reached. Vehicles that move from expected operation to
saturation within a single timestep are automatically identiﬁed
as attackers. Finally, to further reduce false positives, we
stipulate that should ηi+1−ηi be a local maximum that exceeds
ηi+2− ηi+1 and ηi−1ηi−2 by at least ten sample instances then
vehicle i is additionally ﬂagged as anomalous. A vehicle that
is judged anomalous by both the K-NN graph approach and
serves as a local maximum is deemed an attacker.
To validate this approach we performed 300 Monte Carlo
simulations with headway times = [0.5, 1.5] and the attacker
density =1–11%. We assumed that all vehicles in the system
follow control algorithm 1. The derivative gain for the vic-
tims/attackers was slightly higher/lower than needed for string
stability/in-stability, while the proportional gain was set to one
for all vehicles. A sampling period of one second was used
with limits on acceleration/deceleration 2 m s−2/ −4 m s−2
(typical limits for modern-day vehicles), while k = 10 with
a signiﬁcance level α = 0.01 was used for the K-NN graph
detector. A false-positive rate of 0.51% (i.e. non-attackers
identiﬁed as attackers) and a true-positive rate of 78.23% (i.e.
attackers identiﬁed as attackers) were achieved under both
attack scenarios with position measurement noise ∼ N (0, 0.01),
which is comparable to existing work [17]. The low false-
positive rate ensures that in an attack a minimum number
innocent vehicles would be incorrectly identiﬁed as attackers,
at the expensive of not identifying some attackers. We note
that the effect of the 20% of attacker vehicles not detected is
quite small (amplitude of oscillations less than 1 m/s).
Finally, a centralized detection scheme was selected as 1)
we do not assume an honest majority of vehicles or that
any vehicles are, in fact, trustworthy; and 2) even assuming
some percentage of trustworthy vehicles, a decentralized
approach would require rear facing radar for each vehicle and
communication between vehicles, as the only vehicle that could
determine the proper response is a predecessor and/or a follower
that knows the readings of the predecessor’s predecessor.
VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Using a variety of control laws we have shown that a
density of attackers with modiﬁed gains can destabilize large

trafﬁc systems of automated vehicles using ACC or CACC
control schemes. We proved that such attacks will be successful
against heterogeneous systems of vehicles and that
is
applicable in any situation where automated vehicles (even
if they use different following laws) are grouped together, as
such conﬁgurations naturally exhibit platooning-like behavior,
even if not intended. The attack is also effective in mixed
human/automated driving scenarios.

Future work will focus on designing countermeasures
to mitigating the effects of stability attacks. We will also
examine the effect denial of service attacks could have against
proposed solutions such as CACC systems that rely on wireless
communication to maintain stability. Furthermore we endeavor
to advance the current ﬁeld of knowledge to the point that
we design controllers that actively detect an attack and adjust
dynamically to maintain stability or at a minimum reduce
collateral damage to the system.
