User: My python program consists of several files: 

the main execution python script
python modules in *.py files
config file
log files
executables scripts of other languages.

All this files should be available only for root. The main script should run on startup, e.g. via upstart.
Where I should put all this files in Linux filesystem? 
What's the better way for distribution my program? pip, easy_install, deb, ...? I haven't worked with any of these tool, so I want something easy for me.
The minimum supported Linux distributive should be Ubuntu.
Assistant: For sure, if this program is to be available only for root, then the main execution python script have to go to /usr/sbin/.
Config files ought to go to /etc/, and log files to /var/log/.
Other python files should be deployed to /usr/share/pyshared/.
Executable scripts of other languages will go either in /usr/bin/ or /usr/sbin/ depending on whether they should be available to all users, or for root only.
