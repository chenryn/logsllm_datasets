### ISP Access Network Analysis

#### 1. Identify Subscriber’s Globally Routable Address (GRA)
First, we use the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) protocol [13] to discover the GRA corresponding to the subscriber. STUN is a standard client-server protocol that allows a user behind a NAT to learn their public mapped address. We configure the Revelio client to act as a STUN client, which queries an external STUN server (e.g., stun.stunprotocol.org). The STUN server responds with the subscriber's GRA.

- **Without NAT444 Deployment**: If the ISP does not deploy NAT444 (as shown in Figure 1(a)), the GRA corresponds to the address exposed at the Service Demarcation point.
- **With NAT444 Deployment**: If the ISP deploys NAT444 using a topology similar to Figure 1(b), the GRA corresponds to the public IP address exposed at the Intra IP Access point along the reference path.

This step is represented by the "STUN Binding Request" block in the Revelio flowchart (Figure 2). The retrieved information is illustrated in the "Subscriber GRA" data block.

#### 2. Discover Home NAT Device
Next, we determine whether the Service Demarcation device performs NAT. Specifically, we check if the local IP address of the Subscriber Device running the Revelio client in the home network is in the private address space [12].

- **No NAT**: If the local IP address is a public address, we conclude that the client is not behind a NAT and, implicitly, not behind a NAT444 device either. This is confirmed if the local IP address matches the GRA.
- **NAT Present**: If the local IP address is a private address, we infer that a NAT device is present along the path.

This step is represented by the "Home NAT Device" test block in the Revelio flowchart. Depending on the results, the flowchart includes a "No NAT444" stop block or proceeds to the next step.

#### 3. Locate Service Demarcation Point [Path Analysis]
If the CPE performs NAT, we identify the location of the access link (i.e., the link between the Service Demarcation point and the first hop in the ISP's access network) relative to the Revelio client. We use a heuristic approach, assuming the access link is the first link on the outbound path with a transmission latency at least an order of magnitude higher than its neighboring links [17].

To quantify per-link latency, we use a technique similar to pathchar [7]. We estimate per-link delay parameters by taking the minimum values of repeated Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements with different UDP packet sizes along the path, assuming negligible queuing and processing delays. To minimize the impact on the subscriber's network, we gather data by running traceroute hourly over two days, using 21 different packet sizes ranging from 120 bytes to 1,400 bytes, and targeting a high-availability IP address in Level 3’s network. This process results in 48 RTT samples per TTL per packet size, which we analyze to estimate per-link propagation delay and infer the access link.

The pathchar result, labeled "Service Demarc. Location" in the flowchart, is used in subsequent tests.

### 3.3 NAT444 Discovery Phase
This phase aims to identify the location of the device performing NAT to the GRA mapped to the subscriber, specifically before or after the Service Demarcation point. Figure 1(b) illustrates the scenario with NAT444 (CGN) deployed in the DSL access ISP network, after the BRAS and the Core Router.

We perform three tests and interpret the results along with the information collected in the Environment Characterization phase to infer NAT444 deployment. To handle non-standard architectures, we assign different confidence levels to each test. When test results conflict, we prioritize the negative result to avoid false positives.

#### 1. Identify Private/Shared Addresses in the ISP Access Network
The first method in the NAT444 Discovery phase detects the use of private or shared IP addresses in the access network between the Service Demarcation point and the Intra IP Access point. We characterize the path obtained by traceroutes, including inferring the position of the Service Demarcation point. We then check if private or shared addresses are configured along the path toward the public Internet target, and if so, determine their location relative to the Service Demarcation point.

- **High Confidence**: Observing shared address space beyond the Service Demarcation point indicates a high likelihood of NAT444 deployment.
- **Low Confidence**: Observing RFC1918 private addresses beyond the Service Demarcation point suggests a lower confidence level, as the ISP might use private address space for internal infrastructure without deploying NAT444.
- **Inconclusive**: If no private or shared addresses are detected past the Service Demarcation point, the test suite cannot rule out NAT444 deployment, as the ISP might configure public addresses in the access network.

#### 2. Invoke UPnP Actions
NAT Revelio runs tests to infer the hop count between the Service Demarcation device and the device performing the final translation to the subscriber's GRA. We verify whether the address configured on the Service Demarcation point matches the subscriber's GRA.

- **Direct Connection**: If the Revelio client directly connects to the Service Demarcation device, we use Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) IGP protocol [2] to retrieve the IP address of the WAN interface of the CPE. A match indicates no NAT444 deployment, while a mismatch suggests NAT444 deployment.
- **Indirect Connection**: If the Revelio client does not connect directly to the Service Demarcation device, we cannot draw conclusions about NAT444 deployment, as the UPnP test retrieves the IP address of the innermost CPE device within the home network.

#### 3. Traceroute to the Subscriber GRA
We run a traceroute from the Revelio client to the subscriber's GRA to measure the hop count between them.

- **Without NAT444**: The GRA is at the Service Demarcation point, and all traceroute-responding hops are inside the home network.
- **With NAT444**: The GRA is at the Intra IP Access point, which is past the Service Demarcation point. A UDP traceroute to the GRA distinguishes these two cases.

We assign a high confidence level to this test, as it relies on no CPE-specific capabilities and does not assume the ISP configures private or shared IP addresses in the access network. However, the test may fail if the ISP blocks ICMP packets triggered by the traceroute.

### 4. Validation and Large-Scale Revelio Measurement Campaigns

#### 4.1 Revelio Validation in Controlled Environment
With the assistance of a large UK ISP operator, we tested NAT Revelio on a controlled set of subscribers included in a trial deployment of a CGN implementation of NAT444 within the ISP network. The trial environment consisted of operational DSL residential lines connected behind a standalone CGN NAT444 implementation. We ran the Revelio client on 6 Subscriber Devices, 2 of which were behind the NAT444 device. NAT Revelio accurately detected the deployment configuration of all 6 devices.

- **Environment Discovery**: All six Subscriber Devices connected directly to the Service Demarcation device within the home network.
- **NAT444 Discovery**:
  - For the two subscribers connected to the ISP behind a NAT444 solution, all tests successfully indicated the presence of NAT444. The CPE's WAN IP address was identified as shared address space, and the subscriber GRA did not match the Service Demarcation point address. Traceroute measured 6 hops between the Subscriber Devices and the device translating to the GRA, with only the first hop belonging to the home network.
  - For the other 4 devices, the IP addresses at the Service Demarcation point matched the GRA, confirming no NAT444 deployment.

We also tested our NAT444 detection approach on 24 residential DSL lines operated by a large Italian ISP that does not employ NAT444 solutions but uses private IP address space for its infrastructure. Despite the first test indicating the existence of a NAT444 solution based on the detection of RFC1918 address space, traceroute to the subscriber GRA showed that the GRA was at the Service Demarcation point. By prioritizing the negative test, we accurately concluded that there was no NAT444 deployment.
