`WireframeGeometry` generates duplicate edges for both indexed and non-indexed
buffer geometry.
This is true by inspection, as the code does not test for duplicate xyz-
coordinates.
A simple non-indexed example is:
    const geometry = new THREE.TetrahedronGeometry( 1, 0 ); // 6 unique edges
    const wireframe = new THREE.WireframeGeometry( geometry ); // 12 edges
`BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 )` is a simple indexed example.
Duplicating an edge is not a problem most of the time, but when using dashed
lines, it is a problem.

EDIT: Actually, instead of "duplicate edges", they should be referred to as
"coincident edges": A -> B = B -> A.
