User: Assuming that you need to use Nginx reverse proxy and ensure HTTPS transmission security, please introduce how to configure it.
Assistant: To use Nginx reverse proxy and ensure HTTPS transmission security, you need to follow the steps below to configure: 1. Install Nginx and start it. On Ubuntu/Debian, you can install Nginx with the following commands: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx sudo systemctl start nginx ``` 2. Generate an SSL/TLS certificate. You can use a free Let's Encrypt certificate, or a certificate issued by another certificate signing authority. 3. Configure Nginx to use an SSL/TLS certificate. To enable Nginx to listen to the HTTPS request port (443 by default), edit the Nginx configuration file according to the following steps: a. Open the Nginx configuration file: ``` sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf ``` b. Navigate to HTTP Block: ``` http { ... } ``` c. Add the following code: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name example.com; ssl_certificate /path/to/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /path/to/ privkey.pem; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; ``` Pay attention to replace example.com with the actual domain name, /path/to/fullchain.pem and /path/to/privkey.pem with the full path of the certificate, and the port number (such as 8080) following the proxy_pass directive is reversed The port number of the target service proxied to the proxy. d. Save and close the file. 4. Restart Nginx for the changes to take effect: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` Now, Nginx has been configured as a reverse proxy and supports HTTPS secure transmission. Make sure to replace the full path to the certificate with the actual path to the certificate, and the port number of the proxy target with the actual port number.
