ABSTRACT
This paper takes a first look at the potential consequences of cyber-
attacks against structural control systems. We design algorithms
and implement them in a testbed and on well-known benchmark
models for buildings and bridges. Our results show that attacks
to structures equipped with semi-active and active vibration con-
trol systems can let the attacker oscillate the building or bridge
at the resonance frequency, effectively generating threats to the
structure and the people using it. We also implement and test the
effectiveness of attack-detection systems.

1 INTRODUCTION
Since 1980, 258 weather and climate-related natural hazards in the
United States (US) have resulted in $1.75 trillion cumulative costs
of damage to cities [80]. To reduce these costs, civil infrastructures
are being equipped with various sensors for health monitoring and
structural control [65]. Sensors can measure physical quantities
related to the building motion, such as strain, acceleration, velocity,
displacement, pressure, temperature, and ground motion [21, 102].
Structures equipped with control devices can adapt in real-time to

counteract extreme dynamic loads such as earthquakes or wind
storms.
Among 525 buildings of 250 meters or greater height worldwide,
18% (97) are equipped with dynamic modification devices [56]. This
statistic increases to 39% if we consider buildings constructed in
the last decade. Without considering their height, in Japan alone,
more than 50 buildings have Active Mass Dampers (AMD) to control
building vibrations [102], and more than 30 high-rise buildings have
been instrumented with semi-active variable oil dampers [35, 50].
Structural vibration control systems are particularly useful for
tall buildings, often affected by wind-induced vibrations. Wind-
induced vibrations in tall buildings have proven to cause building
motion sickness to the occupants during normal operations [57, 58]
and supplemental damping can mitigate these vibrations. Life-cycle
cost analysis about the investment in control devices, including
semi-active friction devices, has shown that structural control pro-
vides significant economic benefits on tall buildings subjected to
wind loading [29, 64], among other natural hazards.
While structural control provides many benefits, as far as we are
aware, these systems have not been studied from a security per-
spective. As the popularity of structural control increases, we need
to start assessing and improving the security posture. This paper
presents the first study of attacks against control systems in civil
engineering structures. We consider two types of attacks: Denial of
Service (DoS) attacks, where the attacker disables the activation of
specific actuators, and False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, where the
attacker forces the actuators to follow an attack command.
Our contributions include the following: (1) we are the first
research paper to study the impact of attacks to structural control
systems, (2) we provide the first algorithm for optimal DoS attacks
trying to maximize the impact of external vibrations, (3) We identify
metrics, testbeds, and benchmark models of buildings and bridges
to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, (4) We design and test
the first effective attack-detection method in structural control, (5)
We make all our algorithms and models open to the community

2 RELATED WORK
Attacks to CPS Attacks to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) can hap-
pen in a variety of components, including sensors, controllers, and
actuators: (1) an attacker can inject false data into the system by
faking sensor data (e.g., if the sensor data is unauthenticated or if
the attacker has the key material for the sensors) and cause the
control logic of the system to act on malicious data [59]. (2) The at-
tacker can delay or even completely block the information from the
sensors to the controller, causing it to operate with stale data [54].
Session 5A: Control System Security CCS ’21, November 15–19, 2021, Virtual Event, Republic of Korea1320(3) The attacker may be able to compromise the controller and
send incorrect control signals to the actuators [63]. (4) The attacker
can delay or block any control command, thus causing a denial
of control to the system [4]. (5) The attacker can compromise the
actuators and execute a control action that is different to what
the controller intended [88]. And, (6) the attacker may be able to
physically attack the system (e.g.. physically destroying part of the
infrastructure and combine this with a cyber attack) [5].
All these attacks can be classified as either a False Data Injec-
tion FDI or a Denial of Service DoS attack. FDI [49, 59] and DoS
attacks [4] have been discussed in the context of cyber-physical
systems since 2009. In a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack [4], the
adversary prevents the controller from receiving sensor measure-
ments, or the physical system from receiving a proper actuation
command. To launch a denial of service, the adversary can jam the
communication channels, compromise devices and prevent them
from sending data, attack the routing protocols, or even turn off the
lights (without electricity, control systems won’t work). Similarly
physical side channel attacks can inject false signals into a system,
they can also be used to cause DoS attacks [71]. Attackers in close
proximity of a target device can also damage them physically.
In a False Data Injection (FDI) attack [49, 59], the adversary
sends false information where a malicious value (at time t) 𝑎(𝑡 ) will
be different than the non-attacked value 𝑢 (𝑡 ) (𝑎(𝑡 ) ≠ 𝑢 (𝑡 )). The
adversary can launch these attacks by obtaining the secret key of
some sensors, controllers, or actuators (if the communications are
authenticated). Several control systems are air-gaped, and assume a
trusted environment once a device is inside this air-gaped network,
so a malicious insider doesn’t need to worry about authentication.
CPS can be compromised even without a computer-based exploit
in what has been referred to as transduction attacks [34]. By tar-
geting the way sensors capture real-world data, the attacker can
inject a false sensor reading or even a false actuation action, by
manipulating the physical environment around the sensor [34, 36].
For example attackers can use speakers to affect the gyroscope of a
drone [82], exploit unintentional receiving antennas in the wires
connecting sensors to controllers [76], or use intentional electro-
magnetic interference to cause a servo (an actuator) to follow the
attacker’s commands [76].
Popular examples of FDI attacks include scaling attacks 𝑎(𝑡 ) =
𝛼𝑢 (𝑡 ) [86], bias attacks 𝑎(𝑡 ) = 𝑢 (𝑡 ) +𝑏 [13, 16], delay attacks 𝑎(𝑡 ) =
𝑢 (𝑡 − 𝑑) [86], and random attacks (where 𝑎(𝑡 ) is a random value
at each time) [26, 98]. These attacks were successfully applied to
power systems [86], a power plant boiler [98], water plants [13],
robotic vehicles [16], and autonomous vehicles [26]. These simple
attacks, however, do not succeed when targeting a structural control
system.
One critical difference between structural control systems and
most other cyber-physical systems is that attacks against structural
control are not obvious. In a power grid, you know that opening
circuit breakers will disconnect systems. In a vehicle, you know
that you can crash another vehicle by accelerating to top speed. In a
water system, you know that if you inject liquid into a tank and do
not let it out, it will cause an overflow, etc. In contrast, in structural
control systems it is not obvious how to attack the system in a
way that it causes any significant effect. In particular, because each
actuator’s energy is small compared to the whole structure, most
random attacks or heuristics will not have any significant effect.
An attack against structural control systems needs to be strategic
in the way frequencies, magnitudes, and phases are injected at each
of the compromised endpoints.
To target structural control systems, we need to focus on analyz-
ing the response of the structure to various types of vibrations. This
is called frequency analysis. This paper is related to previous work
that exploits when physical systems are sensitive to oscillations
at specific frequencies. For example, an external acoustic signal
tuned at a specific frequency can deteriorate the accuracy of Micro-
Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) gyroscopes [89]. The power
grid might also be vulnerable to small oscillations being amplified
by the system [46, 100]. Our proposed FDI attacks are closest to the
work of Dadras et al. [22], where the authors study how malicious
vehicles in a platoon can make small oscillations in their speed, be
amplified by their neighbors, making the system unstable.
Our FDI attacks extend previous work by designing a new algo-
rithm that finds a (local) optimal amplitude, phase, and frequency
of attacks (rather than just finding a parameter of a predefined
control). In addition, work on DoS attacks is (as far as we are aware)
completely novel. To design our DoS attacks we need to evalu-
ate the potential frequency response of the structure to a future
unknown perturbation. We are not aware of anything similar in
previous work on CPS attacks. Our final novelty when compared
to previous work, is the use-case of structural control, which hasn’t
been previously explored.
Building Automation Security In terms of applications, our
study is related to the security of Building Automation Systems
(BAS) [18, 70]. BAS can monitor and control Heating, Ventilation,
and Air Conditioning (HVAC), lighting, energy consumption and
physical security (cameras, key cards, etc.). Previous research fo-
cused on proposing new security for the Building Automation and
Control Network (BACnet) protocol [11, 31, 32], as well as for im-
proving the security of endpoint devices in BAS [95, 96].
Despite these research efforts, ethical hackers as well as attack-
ers, have found several ways to attack these systems. For example,
ethical hackers took control of the building control system of a
Google office in Australia [104], a ransomware gang attacked a
hotel in Austria four times, disabling their electronic keys [8], a
DDoS attack cut heat to apartments in Finland [62], and vulner-
abilities found in one of the most popular software frameworks
to create building automation controls (the Niagara framework)
had vulnerabilities that could have allowed attackers from taking
remote control to access systems, elevators, HVAC systems, alarms,
and other critical operations [105]. The interest of attackers in struc-
tural control (wherever available) is the logical next step and this
paper is the first proposal for understanding the potential impacts
of sophisticated structural control attacks, as well the first study to
propose new countermeasures.
3 STRUCTURAL CONTROL
Vibration control of structures can adapt in real-time to minimize
the movements of a building, bridge, or wind turbine during ex-
treme events [44]. Structural control systems have three major
components: (i) sensors to capture the state of the environment, (ii)
a computer to process the information from the sensors and make

decisions based on the information, and (iii) actuators to perform
the actions determined by the computer system [20].
Standard sensors for structural monitoring include Linear vari-
able differential transformers (LVDTs), velocity transducers, ac-
celerometers, and load cells, which measure displacement, velocity,
acceleration, and force, respectively. These sensors can work as
linear proportional devices in the frequency range of 0.1ś100 Hz,
covering the frequency band of structural vibration under seismic
or wind excitation.
Actuators are the set of physical devices that execute the in-
structions from the controller [20]. There are four main types of
structural control actuators: passive, semi-active, active, and hybrid
(which combine active and passive actuators). Passive actuators
dissipate the power of external perturbations and do not receive
any control [30]. Passive control devices include linear viscous
dampers, friction dampers, tuned mass dampers, and tuned liquid
column dampers [42, 48]. Active and semi-active systems have
an external energy source to activate hydraulic, electromechani-
cal, or electromagnetic systems. Active control actuators include
HiDAX-s, linear pistons, and mass dampers. Semi-active control
actuators include magneto-rheological (MR) dampers [17] and fric-
tion dampers [23, 24, 39]. Active and semi-active dampers improve
energy dissipation capacity, and create a safer structure when com-
pared to passive devices [1, 55, 102]. Examples of active and semi-
active dampers can be found on bridges and buildings worldwide,
as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.
In this paper we focus on the following three actuators: Magneto-
Rheological MR Dampers, Active Mass Dampers AMDs, and Ac-
tive Tuned Mass Dampers ATMDs. An MR damper has a fluid

controlled by a magnetic field. By varying the power of an electro-
magnet, we can control the damping characteristics of the shock
absorber. Active mass damping approaches consist of applying a
dynamic modification system in a few locations in the structure. An
AMD controls the movement of a mass to counteract vibrations in
the structure. An ATMD consists of an actuator placed between the
structure and a tuned mass damper, a system composed of a mass,
spring, and damper (adequately tuned) attached to a structure to
reduce its dynamic response.
In our simulations we use bridge and building benchmarks pro-
posed by the Committee on Structural Control of the American
Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) [27, 67, 78].
3.1 Vulnerabilities and Adversary Model
Structural control systems integrate various operational technolo-
gies such as Industrial PCs (Regular Windows PCs that pass safety
standards because of their enclosures), Ethernet networks (e.g.,
EtherCAT) or in legacy implementations serial lines (e.g., RS422),

crossing the air-gapped network (such as USB drives) can defeat
this isolation.
