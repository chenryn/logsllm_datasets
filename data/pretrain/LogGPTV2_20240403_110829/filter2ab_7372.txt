**ATT&CK ID:** M1052  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Control

To mitigate "pass the hash" attacks, you can enable UAC (User Account Control) restrictions for local accounts during network logons. This is achieved by configuring the following Registry key:

- **Registry Key Path:** `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`

Alternatively, you can use Group Policy to apply this setting. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
2. Navigate to: **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **System** > **Credential Delegation**.
3. Locate and configure the policy: **Apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logons**.

By enabling this setting, you will ensure that UAC restrictions are applied to local accounts when they log on over the network, thereby mitigating "pass the hash" attacks.
