User: I want to make a python script that:
opens a file, executes the command i,
then writes 2 lines of code, hits escape
executes the command ZZ.
I was thinking along the lines of os.system("vi program") then os.system("i") and os.system("code"), but that didn't work because you can only execute commands. Thank you!
Assistant: It's not clear why you want to do this. To truly run an interactive program, you'll have to create a pseudo-tty and manage it from your python script - not for the faint of heart.
If you just want to insert text into an existing file, you can do that directly from python, using the file commands. Or you could invoke a program like sed, the "stream editor", that is intended to do file editing in a scripted fashion. The sed command supports a lot of the ex command set (which is the same base command set that vi uses) so i, c, s, g, a, all work.
