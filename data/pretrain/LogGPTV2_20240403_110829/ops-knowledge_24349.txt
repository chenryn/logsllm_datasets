It seems like you're encountering issues while trying to install OpenCV on your MacBook Pro, which is running OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard) and has Xcode version 3.2.6. You are currently using Python 2.7, as indicated by the `which python` command. The error message you provided suggests that there was a problem during the linking phase of the build process for the OpenCV library.

Given your setup, I would recommend using MacPorts to install OpenCV, as it can handle the installation of both the library and its Python bindings without much hassle. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Install MacPorts:**
   - First, download the MacPorts installer from the official website: <https://www.macports.org/install.php>
   - Follow the instructions to install MacPorts on your system.

2. **Update MacPorts:**
   - After installing MacPorts, open a terminal and run the following command to update the package list:
     ```sh
     sudo port selfupdate
     ```

3. **Install OpenCV with Python bindings:**
   - Run the following command to install OpenCV along with its Python bindings:
     ```sh
     sudo port install opencv +python27
     ```
   - This command specifies that you want to install OpenCV with support for Python 2.7, which matches the version you are using.

4. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Once the installation is complete, you can verify that OpenCV is installed correctly by running a simple Python script:
     ```python
     import cv2
     print(cv2.__version__)
     ```
   - If everything is set up correctly, this script should print the version of OpenCV that was installed.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please provide the specific error messages, and I can help you troubleshoot further. Additionally, if you need to use a different version of Python or have any other specific requirements, let me know, and I can adjust the instructions accordingly.
