User: Does anyone knows of a proven and simple way of running a system command from a django application?
Maybe using celery? ...
From my research, it's a problematic task, since it involves permissions and insecure approaches to the problem. Am i right? 
EDIT: Use case: delete some files on a remote machine.  
Thanks
Assistant: Here is one approach: in your Django web application, write a message to a queue (e.g., RabbitMQ) containing the information that you need. In a separate system, read the message from the queue and perform any file actions. You can indeed use Celery for setting up this system.
