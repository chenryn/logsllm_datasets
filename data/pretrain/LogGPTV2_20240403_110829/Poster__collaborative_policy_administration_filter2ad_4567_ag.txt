their skills. Historical professional association tend to 
protect their privilege opposing bureaucratic obstacles 
to the free professional practice of new citizen 
who studied abroad: local protectionist policies are 
opposed to innovation that newcomers may bring in 
different professional sectors. While these phenomena 
represent an under exploitation of the cultural 
resources and thereafter a lost for national economy, 
they also contribute to increase personal frustration 
and social friction.
In Italy the overall quality of public services (such as 
health care assistance and education) is high and free 
for all the citizens, but bureaucratic procedures are 
quite complex and appear as obscure for new comers 
since very low attention is paid to communication. 
Some specific features of the local service organization 
make quite complicate and frustrating the access to 
some public services for new citizens. 
“From our research it 
appeared as evident the 
importance of cognitive and 
psychological phenomena 
related to sense of  
belonging and identity.”
To better understand the complex issues related to 
the wide topic of multiculturalism in Italy, we made 
researches based on different activities. 
Firstly previously the beginning of the course, we 
had interviews with experts of different disciplines 
and carried on an investigation into the literature in 
fields as sociology, psychology, cultural anthropology. 
Secondly we contacted and started to individuate 
the main areas of intervention along with selected 
organizations aimed to the solution of specific 
objectives such as health care, cultural exchange, 
language learning. These ONG are based on the 
15
active participation of the new Italians together or 
are completely founded by citizens of foreign origin; 
As our research community is characterized by a high 
number of researchers and PhD students coming from 
foreign countries finally, the personal involvement of 
the members of our research group is very high and 
personal. Thirdly one of the essential issues was to 
draft a project brief that will allow students to get 
close to the intercultural communication concept, by 
designing digital services. It is important to stress out 
that one of the main objectives of the course was to 
teach students how to learn by doing, this referring to 
the transfer of social interaction dynamics in digital 
service solutions.
1.3 Raising the awareness on the national identity change
We chose to not focus our attention on extreme events 
such as the attitudes of racism and foreclosure, and 
instead we concentrated our attention on everyday 
life small and great difficulties normally encountered 
by new citizens and often taken as given and non 
modifiable. We would like to make a contribution in 
terms of service design to the solution of big and 
small problems, reducing friction that every day new 
citizens experience living and acting in Italy. In other 
words, we choose to adopt both top down and bottom 
up approaches to embrace the different aspects of 
social complexity.
From our research it appeared as evident the 
importance of cognitive and psychological phenomena 
related to sense of belonging and identity.
As new citizens face with practical problems 
(residence permit, job search, medical care), the ability 
of each individual to make the best use of his/her own 
resources and actively seek solutions to the problems 
and needs of everyday life are ‘strongly influenced by 
the quality’ of human relations. The daily confrontation 
with stereotypes and prejudices produce friction and 
fatigue in every daily action and these difficulties 
do not vanish with time, and are still experienced by 
children of immigrants, born on Italian land, especially 
when the physical appearance puts in evidence the 
foreign origin.
The condition of a citizen with a foreign background 
does not end in a short time and sometimes cannot 
ever run out. Everyone has the right to maintain a 
strong link with the traditions of the country of origin, 
with its cultural roots, with specific tastes, values, and 
habits. Diversity is human, and must be accepted and 
valued in all its forms. Especially in cases of the visible 
minorities, the ethnic minority status might never 
end. To minimize the psychological problems related 
to the cultural shock and to reduce fatigue related to 
the condition of “newly arrived”, it is very important 
that Italian citizens mature a new awareness of the 
potential of multiculturalism. In order to understand 
the perception of the migration flow in the present 
Italian society, it is necessary to briefly review the 
evolution of the foreigners’ image in the public 
opinion.
2. TOWARDS THE EXPLOITATION OF CULTURAL 
DIVERSITY 
2.2 Italy from an emigration to immigration country
The imaginary attached to the Italian culture is 
strongly rooted in the cultural heritage and the rich 
architectural and art scene, and emphasizes the 
strong national identity recognized and preserved 
even in communities outside Italy. In the same time 
the Italian society is historically an emigration one 
the phenomenon reaching important peaks at the 
beginning 1900’s when the emigration flow accounted 
more than 600,000 persons each year. Although the 
main target stayed the United States a considerable 
part of the population also choose France, Germany 
and Switzerland as destination countries. This 
situation continued throughout the 50’s and 60’s, the 
migration being however legalized and encouraged by 
legislation acts that released temporary working visas 
to Italian citizens especially in Germany [3].
If until the first half of the last century the migration 
flow exited the country, the phenomenon of internal 
migration emerged as a strong trend in the 50’s and 
70’s. This changed radically the demographics of Italy 
reporting more than 2 million regional migrants [4]. 
This phenomenon of inter-regional internal migration 
underlined the distinction between “strong and weak” 
economic areas and between south and north. 
The brief review of the migration trends shows a 
society in continuous transformation that experienced 
internal changes, in this sense revealing strong 
economic and cultural regional identities. This sets 
up the scene for one of the most significant social 
changes that occurred in the last 10 to 12 years, in 
which Italy has seen an increasing inflow of foreigners 
coming from North Africa, the Middle East, and the 
Eastern Europe. Some of the most attractive areas 
are in the northern Italy and in particular Lombardy 
[5] in this respect the foreign population following 
an inter-regional migration trend.  Having seen the 
transformation of the shift from an emigration to an 
immigration society in Italy several important issues 
have to be considered. First the already consolidated 
immigrant population started to integrate in the social 
tissue, the mixed families constituting 8,3% in 2009 [6]. 
This brings the emergence of the second generation 
Italians, who inherited a double cultural identity and 
are perfectly integrated in the Italian society. Second 
an important incoming factor is the diversification of 
religious beliefs and practices, that include Islamic, 
Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish 
[7]. The above-mentioned data show at a closer look 
a phenomenon of cultural diversification that wasn’t 
present before, and that raises questions regarding the 
integration of the foreigners in the Italian culture and 
how this will affect the traditional cultural heritage. 
2.3 Foreigners in the public opinion
This change is received from the public opinion with 
certain reluctance; most of the times the metaphor 
attached to the incoming flows of foreigners is that 
of intruders into a terrain to which they don’t belong. 
In a study on the public opinion since the emergence 
of the immigration phenomenon in Italy, Sciortino 
e Colombo emphasize the changes on the public 
discourse referring to foreigners. Analyzing the printed 
press from the 1969 to 2001 the authors drafted a 
distinct change in the attitude towards foreigners 
and the image constructed around the figure of 
the immigrant. In this study the perception of the 
phenomenon changes slowly from its recognition as 
significant [’69-’81] to the acknowledgement of the 
immigration impact and its politic implications, [’82-
’91] and then to the construction of the Pandora box 
myth, advertising the image of the immigrants in a 
negative light [8] .
It is important to stress out how the factors 
influencing this changes have different sources, in part 
being influenced by the major socio - political changes 
that took place, such as the falling of the Berlin Wall 
in 1989, and the communist regime the event of the 
16
European Community, or more recently the war in 
Somalia. 
2.4 “Noi e loro” in Italy
The above-mentioned changes mark a deeper change 
in the socio-cultural identity of the Italian society, 
that has seen a shift from focusing on the regional 
differences, during the inter-regional migration period 
into acquiring a more coherent cultural identity in 
contrast with the incoming foreign culture brought by 
immigration. This counter posing of values, beliefs and 
languages evolves from the necessity of negotiating 
a simultaneous presence into a shared territory. As 
Triandafillydou, explains, the host countries and 
societies are faced with the indispensable re-affirming 
of each communities’ identity creating in this way a 
“others-within” situation in which the political and 
social order is constantly re-negotiated [9]. This process 
can be seen from Social Identity Theory perspective in 
which the in-group, out-group paradigm emerges[10]. 
In social identity theory, the individuals consider 
themselves part of a certain group according to 
cognitive and perceptive aspects. The group members 
are not initially linked by affective ties, but rather 
share the same behavioral patterns and perspective 
on the surrounding context This paradigm can be 
extended to large groups and communities in order 
to understand the host national group and its natural 
reaction to the diversity of the incoming foreign 
groups[11]. In the next chapter we will argue that 
understanding the dynamic between different groups 
could lead to negotiate a more cohesive and therefore 
sustainable society. 
3. CULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY AS A POSSIBLE 
FRAMEWORK FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION ACTIONS 
3.2 Culture as an emerging sustainability factor
Environmental, economic and social sustainability and 
sustainable development have been a growing major 
concern in the public discourse since the formulation 
of the first action plan in the 1987 in the Brundtland 
as part of the social sustainable development, a 
more recent perspective stresses the importance of 
culture, bringing it forward as the fourth pillar of the 
Report and Agenda[12]. If culture was initially seen 
sustainable development [13] arguing that sustainable 
communities depend upon the capability of individuals 
to understand and respect each other’s values, and 
17
this qualities are built through cultural interaction 
considered the central pillar of sustainability because 
peoples’ identities, signifying systems, cosmologies
and epistemic frameworks shape how the environment 
[14]. Moreover, Nurse argues that culture should be 
is viewed and lived in [15]. This perspective is 
reinforced at international level by the UNESCO 
Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the 
Diversity of Cultural Expressions, that states that 
“parties shall endeavor to integrate culture in their 
development policies at all levels for the creation of 
conditions conducive to sustainable development and, 
within this framework, foster aspects relating to the 
protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural 
expressions” [16]. In this context the focus on culture, 
brings a new, more detailed dimension to the social 
sustainability, emphasizing the role of the cultural 
aspects in the creation of a cohesive and therefore 
more sustainable social environment. The social 
innovation as suggested by Mulgan concerns “social 
activities that are motivated by the goal of meeting 
social needs and that are predominantly developed 
and diffused through social organizations who’s 
primary goals are social” [17] within this definition 
the intercultural dialog can be placed as a main goal 
to attain in the context of an increasing multicultural 
society. As shown before the specificity of the Italian 
social context is that of a continuously changing one, 
a change that operates at the cultural level activating 
contrasting forces.  
We suggest that it is in the realm of this tension that 
the social innovation actions geared towards cultural 
sustainability are relevant and necessary. Rather 
than perceiving the barriers that cultural diversity 
imposes, the social innovation activities enable the 
stakeholders in this changing process to sense the 
opportunities and acknowledge the benefits of a 
heterogeneous society. 
3.3 Intercultural dialog and communication design
Having individuated the overall area in which the 
social innovation actions can be implemented the next 
step is to draw the attention on the precise issues that 
can be addressed through these actions and how this 
could inform the work of the communication designers. 
Taking a closer look at the intercultural contact several 
literatures shown the impact that the immersion in a 
new and unknown cultural environment has on the 
foreigners. The notion of “cultural shock” pinpoints 
the psychological phenomenon that occurs in the 
absence of cultural cues that can help the foreigner 
decipher the new environment [18] [19] [20]. In the 
same time the social context reacts to a critical mass 
of foreigners that have the potential to influence an 
established system of values, beliefs and traditions. 
Rather than a uniform background to which foreigners 
have to gradually get accustomed, the hosting 
context has to be seen as a dynamic system that 
modifies through cultural influences and exchanges. 
At individual level the intercultural contact has to be 
seen from both sides, weighting the phenomenon of 
cultural shock also from the perspective of the locals 
that come in contact with foreigners. A strategy to 
build an intercultural dialog has to be constructed 
from both sides and can constitute the objective of a 
communication design activity. 
The task of the designer in this case is to observe the 
dynamic of the social interactions, acknowledge the 
cultural differences, anticipate the emerging frictions 
and draft strategies that can be applied in order to 
decrease the impact of the intercultural contact. 
In the specific case of the exercise in the design of 
digital services, the digital tools are intended to offer 
support in the mediation of the intercultural social 
interactions. The final purpose of the digital services 
is to sustain the creation of a multicultural cohesive 
society, in which the cultural baggage of all its 
participants is considered to have a value. This sets up 
an important challenge for the designers, who have 
to be conscious of their own identity as individuals 
and groups in order to deconstruct the “us and them” 
concept and identify connection points on which the 
intercultural dialog can be built. 
4. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
4.2 Areas for service design interventions 
The design of public and collaborative services 
can play a relevant role to promote new forms of 
dialog between institutions and citizens; meaningful 
services can provide relevant experiences, offering 
innovative solutions of practical problems but also 
offering opportunities for a better exploitation of 
the potentialities related to multicultural social 
composition. This opens a wide area in which the 
communication design can play an important role. 
The objectives that can be tackled through a design 
approach range from promoting an increased 
awareness on the issues related to a multicultural 
society to suggesting solutions to practical problems, 
and seeking new organization forms that take into 
account the cultural diversity. 
Italy is now a multicultural society and in several 
aspects, most Italians have accepted the change while 
most new comers find Italy a place where it is possible 
and convenient to stay.
On the other hand, new and old citizens strongly feel 
the need of a system renewal; in order to reduce the 
friction experimented in every day life, and especially 
with respect to the law system and during the fruition 
of public services. But the answers to the problems are 
not simple. We can better explain some of the tangles 
of the present situation through an example referred 
to the education field.
Traditionally, public Italian primary school provides 
excellent education programs, at least in most parts 
of the country. Teachers feel socially responsible to 
transfer basic language and math skills so to ensure 
the minimum knowledge set to all citizens. 
4.3 Education system for a multicultural society 
As the number of immigrants grew, we assisted 
also to a relevant increase of the number of non-
Italian speaking (or better, non Italian mother 
tongue) children. While young people usually can 
learn new languages in very short time, it is also 
evident that, when the number of non-Italian mother 
tongue students increases, the education goals and 
methodologies should be re-defined. As Italy is a 
mono-language country, teachers are normally not 
trained to manage multi-language classes, as instead
