User: I have a web application which is written with python (Pyramid) and in the apache server, inside of the one of the Python we are launching a SH file which is a service to sending SMS.
The problem is always the permission is denied.
we tried the run the SH file by login into the root and it works.
we changed the owner of the both files Python one and SH one to 'root' but not works!
any ideas?!
Assistant: Well you changed the owner of the files to root, and then you ran as root, and it worked, so that makes sense.  The problem is that root isn't necessarily the user executing the script in your webapp.  You need to find which user is trying to execute the script, and then change the files' ownership to that user (depending on how the scripts are invoked, you may need to chmod them as well to make sure they are executable)
