User: How can I get to know what my desktop environment is using Python? I like the result to be gnome or KDE or else.
Assistant: Sometimes people run a mix of desktop environments. Make your app desktop-agnostic using xdg-utils; that means using xdg-open to open a file or url, using xdg-user-dir DOCUMENTS to find the docs folder, xdg-email to send e-mail, and so on.
