Not sure how this could be done but for our application we could run the same
container 10 times on the same minion quite happily using different ports as
it is lightweight. To load balance though we would need to map the ports back
to appear as one service port. To allow other machines to talk to it easily.
May be it could hang of the container port name and a matching regex on the
pod name. So all pods that start Fred- with a port called http would be load
balanced by the same service?
