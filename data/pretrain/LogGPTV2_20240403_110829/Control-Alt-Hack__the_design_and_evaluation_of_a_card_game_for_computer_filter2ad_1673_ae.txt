awareness,  presumably  precisely  because  of  its  non-traditional

After  performing  the  activity,  some  people  say  that  their

don’t feel that it has changed much at all. Would you say that 
your perception of computer security has changed? If so, how?

With  the  educator  surveys—the  primary  evaluation  method  of 
Control-Alt-Hack 
the  valuable 
perspectives  of  informed  and  expert  individuals,  as  well  as 
secondhand  access  to  a  large  population  of  students.  We  also, 
however,  wished  to  more  directly  study  individuals’  experiences 
with  the  game,  and  therefore  performed  a  supplementary  user 
study.  We  primarily  simulated  the  experience  of  individuals  of 
varying  backgrounds  picking  up  and  playing  the  game  in  a  non-
classroom-setting.  Section  5.2  provides  background  on  the 
participants. 
In  performing  the  user  study,  we  received  participant  responses 
that  indicated  that—at  least  in  the  short  term—we  are  increasing 
or  reinforcing  participants’  awareness  and/or  improving  their 
perception of computer security and computer science, as per our 
Awareness and Perception Goals articulated in Section 2.1.  
Table  6  presents  participant  quotes  in  response  to  the  prompt  on 
the post-gameplay questionnaire: 
8  of  the  11  participants  provided  responses  which  gave  some 
indication  that  their  awareness  of  computer  security  issues 
increased  or  their  perceptions  about  the  field  were  changed. 
Interestingly,  even  though  some  of  these  participants  responded 
that their perception of computer security had not changed (2 out 
of  the  8),  they  proceeded  to  elaborate  and  provide  qualitative 
evidence that they were  engaged with  one  of our  learning  goals. 
For  the  remaining  3  participants,  none  of  their  responses 
suggested  that  their  awareness  had  increased  or  that  their 
perceptions  had  changed.  Some  participants  (3/11)  supplied 
critiques on the game; however, the sentiments in those critiques 
are  covered  by  the  educators’  critiques  (Section  6.2),  and  we  do 
not discuss them further here. 
There is a range of participant responses present even in our small 
sample  size.  The  Goal  Mappings  column  provides  a  loose 
mapping from the participant’s response to our project goals; the 
process  is  subjective,  and  we  invite  readers  to  interpret  different 
mappings from participant responses to project goals.  
The  project  goals  are  fully  articulated  in  Section  2.1,  but  they 
might be paraphrased and shortened as follows:  
  Awareness Goal #1: Importance/Impact of Security; 
  Awareness Goal #2: Breadth of Technologies; 
  Awareness Goal #3: Creativity of Adversaries; 
Perception Goal #1: Counter-Stereotype; and 
Perception Goal #2: Professional Opportunities. 
924All  of  the  goals  appear  at  least  once  in  Table  6,  suggesting  that 
we have had some success in crafting the game to touch upon the 
issues in question. 
8.  REFLECTIONS 
We  take  this opportunity to  discuss some  of our reflections from 
going through the process of creating, distributing, and evaluating 
a computer security-themed tabletop card game for the purpose of 
promoting computer security awareness and education.  
Physical Games in Security Education.  There is a long history 
of  using  games  in  education  (Section  9),  and  our  work  further 
attests to the benefits and value of using a game—and in our case, 
a  physical  game—in  educational  settings.    Such  games  do  not 
always  match  the  needs  of the  relevant educators,  but  when  they 
do  match,  they  can  provide  valuable  catalysts  for  engaging 
students  and  achieving  certain  learning  objectives—in  our  case, 
our Awareness and Perception goals.   
Game Mechanics Tradeoffs. Our main observations concern the 
selection  of  game  mechanics.  Overall,  working  with  pre-existing 
mechanics was a positive experience, especially given our lack of 
expertise in the area. We wish to re-emphasize, however, the fact 
that  mechanics  directly  dictate  or  heavily  influence  gameplay 
properties,  including:  how  long  it  takes  to  learn  to  play  a  game; 
how long games take to play; the replay value of a game; and the 
ability 
to  form  diverse  strategies.  Additionally,  we  were 
particularly  interested  in  how  much  textual  content  could  be 
inserted  into  the  game.  These  variables,  which  ultimately 
contribute  to  an  (unclearly  defined)  function 
that  dictates 
gameplay enjoyment, are somewhat interdependent. For example, 
the replay value of a game is somewhat dictated by how much the 
game facilitates strategizing; a game’s available strategies, in turn, 
have  some  relationship  with  the  complexity  of  the  game’s  rules, 
which  directly  affects  the  amount  of  time  that  it  takes  to  learn  a 
game, and partially affects the amount of time that it takes to play 
a game. 
While  these  gameplay  properties  do  not  have  clean-cut  direct  or 
inverse relationships, they nonetheless impact one another. When 
choosing  or  creating  gameplay  mechanics,  sometimes  tradeoffs 
will  be  necessary.  It  is  critical  to  prioritize  these  properties  in 
order to attempt to achieve an optimal fit. 
Communication  and  Representation.  One  of  our  takeaways 
from  the  educator  surveys  was  the  relative  importance  of 
communicating to educators the exact nature of the game that we 
were  distributing.  While  we  did  distribute  cover  letters  with 
shipped  games,  they  were  insufficiently  precise  regarding  the 
nature of the game. We never intended to design a game to teach 
penetration 
testing  methods.  Educators  have  a  number  of 
responsibilities, and may be too busy to fully vet a game before its 
use;  it  is  therefore  critical  to  provide  as  much  information  as 
possible  regarding  the  nature  of  a  game  and  its  intended  usage 
scenarios. 
Graphic  Design  and  Illustration.  While  we  did  not  attempt  to 
directly measure the contribution of the aesthetics of the game to 
achieving our goals, we do not wish to suggest its irrelevance by 
eliminating  it  from  the  discussion.  From  observation,  we  can 
comment  that  the  graphic  design,  illustration,  and  production 
quality  of  the  game  seem  to  have  a  large  effect  at  least  on  its 
initial  reception.  Perhaps  the  most  poignant  repeated  comment 
that we have received upon presenting the game to others is, “It’s 
like  a  real  game!”  The  difference  between  these  individuals’ 
apparent expectations and their reaction to Control-Alt-Hack is an 
implicit commentary on their expectations regarding “educational 
games.”  Further  study  could  help  place  the  relevance  of  game 
aesthetics in the context of overall success. 
9.  RELATED WORK 
We  separate  our  discussion  of  related  work  into  work  on 
commercial  games  and  games  created  more  as  research 
endeavors. 
9.1  Commercial Games 
Previous  commercial  tabletop  card  games  dealing  with  computer 
security  include  games  such  as  Fantasy  Flight  Games’  Android: 
Netrunner, published in 2012, and Steve Jackson Game’s Hacker, 
published  in  1992  (now  out  of  print).  We  believe  that  our 
contribution  is  distinct  in  several  ways.  First,  we  take  many 
opportunities  to  ground  our  card  contents  in  a  variety  of  current 
technologies and actual attack threats (see Section A.1 and Table 
7 in Appendix). While this means that Control-Alt-Hack is at risk 
of  becoming  outdated,  this  also  means  that  it  is  particularly 
topical.  Second,  while  these  games  undoubtedly  helped—and 
to  help—attract  people  to  computer  science  and 
continue 
computer  security,  they  portray  hacking—and  hackers—in  the 
style  of  a  particular  niche  (although  compelling)  subculture.  We 
chose,  primarily  via  graphic  design  and  illustration  choices,  to 
embrace  a  more  non-traditional  hacker  “tone”  in  the  hopes  of 
connecting  with  a  slightly  different  audience.  Third,  since  we 
created our card game specifically with awareness goals in mind, 
we  are  also  contributing  an  evaluation  of  our  game  in  education 
contexts. 
9.2  Games in Research 
Gondree et al. [11] gives an overview of some of the benefits of 
using  casual  games  to  impart  modest  security  information;  they 
reference Klopfer et al.’s [14] five freedoms essential to play, and 
reinterpret  those  freedoms  as  mapping  to  the  adversarial, 
exploratory aspects of computer security. 
 [d0x3d!] is a tabletop board game designed to casually introduce 
a  wide  audience  to  some  of  the  terminology  and  adversarial 
thinking that is involved in network security [8]. Exploit! is a card 
game that is primarily intended for entertainment for the security 
audience,  not  education  [5].  Elevation  of  Privilege  [18,  27], 
Protection Poker [33], and OWASP Cornucopia [20] are meant to 
help  train  and  augment  threat  modeling  and  risk  assessment  in 
software development. 
CyberCIEGE [4] and CyberProtect [30] are electronic games that 
have  players  act  as  network  administrators  who  must  utilize 
limited resources to manage overall network risk. 
There  are  a  variety  of  Capture-the-Flag  competitions  (e.g.,  [6, 
21]),  which  are  competitive  and  engaging  ways  to  promote  or 
simulate  offensive  security.  There  are  also  some  defensive 
competitions,  such  as  the  Collegiate  Cyber  Defense  Competition 
[19]. 
to  skill 
Educational  research  communities  have  looked  at  a  variety  of 
aspects  of  using  games  in  education:  for  example,  making 
educational  games  adapt 
level  [1],  using  game 
development  as  a  vehicle  for  programming  assignments  [24], 
using games to  teach specific topics such as  computer  ethics [2], 
or  using  games  to  teach  how  to  detect  phishing  emails  [25].  We 
stress, however, that educational games are used to teach a variety 
of  topics  beyond  computer  science  or computer  security,  such  as 
mathematical fractions (e.g., [3]) or algebra (e.g., [31]). 
In  the  context  of  security  education  research,  but  not  in  the 
context  of  games,  there  have  been  numerous  explorations  of 
925methods  for  helping  students  learn  the  technical  skills  necessary 
to protect computer systems against attackers (e.g., [17, 32]).  
10.  CONCLUSION 
In  this  paper  we  presented  the  design  and  evaluation  of  Control-
Alt-Hack,  a  card  game  for 
increasing  computer  security 
awareness. Our goal was to generate awareness of security issues 
and  improve  the  accuracy  of  people’s  perception  of  computer 
security  as  a  discipline  and  career  choice.  Critically,  we  traded 
some technical complexity in the topics discussed in exchange for 
increased  engagement:  put  another  way,  we  set  out  to  create  a 
game  that  players  could  find  inherently  fun,  from  which  they 
might learn incidentally in the course of enjoying the gameplay. 
the  game,  primarily  derived  from 
Our  evaluation  of 
the 
experiences  of  22  educators  representing  over  450  students, 
suggests that we accomplished our goals. Educators who used the 
game  in  their  classrooms  overwhelmingly  indicated  that  they 
would  suggest  the  game  to  others,  while  the  majority  reported 
both that they would use the game again and that students enjoyed 
the  game  and  experienced  increased  security  awareness.  2 
educators  teaching  non-security  computer  science  courses  would 
not  have  taught  the  material  without  the  game.  A  supplementary 
evaluation  with  11  users  suggested  that  even  among  a  small 
number of participants, their reactions are aligned with a number 
of our goals in creating the game. 
We view these results as a strong signal suggesting that our game 
represents  an  effective  model  for  disseminating  ideas  and 
encouraging  interest  in  computer  security.  We  hope  that  our 
process for selecting mechanics, designing content, and evaluating 
our  effectiveness  is  informative  to  those  wishing  to  undertake 
similar endeavors, and we hope that further research will explore 
the  usage  of  educational  or  awareness-raising  games  to  engage 
and inspire.
