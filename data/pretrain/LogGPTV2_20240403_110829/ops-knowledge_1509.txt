User: I installed python 2.7.9 instead of 3.4.3 due to module xlutils not working on 3.4.3 and from the time I installed python 2.7.9 and I just can't install the related modules to it by using pip install and I added the ;C:\Python27 to the system path.
what am I missing here coz it keeps on telling me this error:
'pip is not recognized as an internal or external command
Assistant: Pip is not in C:\Python27.
It's in C:\Python27\Scripts.
Check that folder to make sure there is a pip.exe, if there is then it should have installed fine, and make sure that C:\Python27\Scripts is in your PATH.
