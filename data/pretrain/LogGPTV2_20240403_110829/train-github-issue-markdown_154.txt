Hi!  
When I was writing my own version of Game of Life, I made new function which
caused message:
    C:\Users\User\projects\testi2>cargo build
       Compiling testi2 v0.1.0 (file:///C:/Users/User/projects/testi2)
    ... some warnings...
    error: internal compiler error: unexpected panic
    note: the compiler unexpectedly panicked. this is a bug.
    note: we would appreciate a bug report: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace
    thread 'rustc' panicked at 'assertion failed: slice_layout_is_correct(cx, &member_llvm_types[..], element_type)', C:/bot/slave/stable-dist-rustc-win-gnu-64/build/src/librustc_trans\trans\debuginfo\metadata.rs:579
    Could not compile `testi2`.
    To learn more, run the command again with --verbose.
This happens only with cargo build, but with rustc it's fine.  
I noticed that following program is enough to cause that:
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }
    fn laske_ymparisto(taulukko: &[[bool]]) -> i32{
        6
    }
My rust version:  
rustc 1.1.0 (`35ceea3` 2015-06-19)  
binary: rustc  
commit-hash: `35ceea3`  
commit-date: 2015-06-19  
host: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu  
release: 1.1.0
I would like to know if anyone else gets this kind of problem or is it just
me.
