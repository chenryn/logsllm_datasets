Interrupting SendWorker
Which of the following logs is generated by the above log template? Assuming the first two tokens of the generated log are timestamp and log level.

A: 18:25:25,206 INFO autopurge.purgeInterval set to 0
B: 15:31:42,213 INFO FOLLOWING
C: 19:35:15,420 WARN Interrupting SendWorker
D: 19:29:17,176 INFO Received connection request /10.10.34.11:59852

Assistant: Answer: C

Explanation: According to the given log template in the question, it can be determined that the key phrase in the log template is "Interrupting SendWorker". Option C exactly includes this key phrase, so option C is generated by the aforementioned log template. The other options A, B, and D do not include the key phrase "Interrupting SendWorker", so they do not comply with the log template and are not generated by it. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
