User: I created a script that will tell me what to wear in the morning based on the weather (i.e. rain slicker if it will rain, heavy jacket if it will be cold, etc).  I have fairly basic programming experience with python and the script works perfectly, but I want to be able to create a file that I can just double-click from my desktop and the script will automatically run.
My goal is to be able to simply double click [something] in the morning and it will automatically run the script and thus tell me what to wear.  How could I go about doing this?
System Specifications:

python
Mac OSX
Assistant: Use a batch file to make it automatic 
Example :
1. Open Notepad -> type the following.
This one's for Windows..It might give you a hint
:start
      C:\Python34\python.exe(your python file location)Your *.py file location.
:end
Save this with a *.bat extension
That's it ..you can configure more on this batch,I guess batch is the automation for day to day script
