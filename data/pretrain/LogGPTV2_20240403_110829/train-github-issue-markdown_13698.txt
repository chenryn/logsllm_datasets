Running `julia doc/genstdlib.jl` to generate the ReST documentation fails on
the following commit at the following line:
https://github.com/dpsanders/julia/blame/d633afac7d86021525056445efe1d12a1a7c3974/doc/stdlib/numbers.rst#L358
This is due to the fact that it finds a "duplicate" at
https://github.com/dpsanders/julia/blame/d633afac7d86021525056445efe1d12a1a7c3974/doc/stdlib/numbers.rst#L371
What is happening is that the first is a function definition, but the second
is a _usage_ of the same string within the docstring of a _different_
function, and thus should not be a duplicate.
(This did not happen until `with_rounding` was merged with `setrounding` in
#13232, which gave rise to this clash.)
Removing the exact text `setrounding(T, mode)` from within the definition of
the second docstring successfully generates the correct documentation.
