10.2.1 Upgrading with the Graphical User Interface Installer
Perform the following steps to upgrade to xDB Replication Server 6.2 using the graphical
user interface installer.
Step 1: Any pending backlog of transactions on the publication tables must be replicated
before starting the upgrade process.
Step 2: After all pending transactions have been replicated to their target databases, stop
the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x publication server and subscription server (see sections
5.2.1 and 5.3.1).
Step 3: Install xDB Replication Server 6.2. See Chapter 3 for instructions on installing
xDB Replication Server, but note the differences described in the following steps.
Step 4: Following the acceptance of the license agreement in Step 11 of Section 3.1, the
Select Components screen appears, but with the entries grayed out. The old xDB
Replication Server components are replaced by the new ones in the old xDB Replication
Server’s directory location. Click the Next button.

Step 7: The remaining screens that appear confirm completion of the installation process
and allow you to exit from Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus.
Step 8: After installation completes, the publication server of the new xDB Replication
Server product should be running, connected to the controller database used by xDB
Replication Server 6.1. The subscription server may or may not be running at this point,
however, that is an expected outcome of this process.
Step 9: Complete the publication server and subscription server configuration file setup.
In the XDB_HOME/etc directory, a new set of configuration files for xDB Replication
Server version 6.2 are created. These files are named xdb_pubserver.conf.new and
xdb_subserver.conf.new. The new configuration files contain any new
configuration options added for xDB Replication Server 6.2.
The old configuration files used by xDB Replication Server version 6.1.x remain
unchanged as xdb_pubserver.conf and xdb_subserver.conf.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Merge the old and new configuration files so that the resulting, active configuration files
contain any new xDB Replication Server 6.2 configuration options as well as any non-
default settings you used with xDB Replication Server 6.1.x and wish to continue to use
with xDB Replication Server 6.2.
The final set of active configuration files must be named xdb_pubserver.conf and
xdb_subserver.conf.
In the XDB_HOME/etc/sysconfig directory, make sure the xDB Startup Configuration
file xdbReplicationServer-62.config contains the parameter settings you wish to
use with xDB Replication Server 6.2. See Section 2.3.1.4 for information on the xDB
Startup Configuration file.
Step 10: Restart the publication server and the subscription server (see sections 5.2.1 and
5.3.1).
Step 11: Check the publication server and subscription server log files to verify that no
errors have occurred (see Section 10.3.2.4).
Step 12: Adjust the publication server and subscription server port numbers if necessary.
The xDB Replication Server 6.2 publication and subscription servers are installed to use
the default port numbers 9051 and 9052, respectively. If the xDB Replication Server
6.1.x replication systems used port numbers other than 9051 and 9052, then perform the
modifications to correct this inconsistency as described in Section 10.2.3.
If no such adjustment to the port numbers is needed, register the publication server and
subscription server with the xDB Replication Console as described in sections 5.2.1 and
5.3.1. The existing replication systems should appear in the replication tree of the xDB
Replication Console.
Step 13: You are now ready to use xDB Replication Server 6.2 to create new replication
systems and manage existing ones.
10.2.2 Upgrading with the xDB Replication Server RPM Package
If you are using xDB Replication Server 6.1.x that was installed using the xDB RPM
package, upgrading to xDB Replication Server 6.2 from an RPM package is
accomplished as described in this section.
Note: Be sure the repository configuration file edb.repo for xDB Replication Server
6.2 is set up in the /etc/yum.repos.d directory. See Section 3.3 for information.
Step 1: Any pending backlog of transactions on the publication tables must be replicated
before starting the upgrade process.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
Step 2: After all pending transactions have been replicated to their target databases, stop
the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x publication server and subscription server (see sections
5.2.1 and 5.3.1).
Step 3: Save a copy of the following configuration files:
 /etc/edb-repl.conf
 /usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc/xdb_pubserver.conf
 /usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc/xdb_subserver.conf
 /usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc/sysconfig/xdbReplicationServer-
61.config
Copies of these files are typically saved by the upgrade process if the files had been
modified since their original installation. However, it is safest to save copies in case the
upgrade process fails to do so. Use the saved files as your xDB Replication Server 6.1.x
configuration files for the updates described in Step 7.
Step 4: If any Oracle publication or subscription databases are used in existing single-
master replication systems, make sure a copy of the Oracle JDBC driver, version ojdbc5
or later, will be accessible by the publication server and subscription server where xDB
Replication Server 6.2 will be installed. See Section 5.1.3.1 for information.
Note: There are two options available: Option 1) Copy the Oracle JDBC driver to the
jre/lib/ext subdirectory of your Java runtime environment. Option 2) Copy the
Oracle JDBC driver to the lib/jdbc subdirectory of the xDB Replication Server
installation directory.
It is suggested that you perform option 1 (copy the Oracle JDBC driver to the
jre/lib/ext subdirectory of your Java runtime environment).
If on the other hand you perform option 2, you must copy the Oracle JDBC driver to the
/usr/ppas-xdb-6.2/lib/jdbc directory after you have installed xDB Replication
Server 6.2.
Step 5: It is best to ensure that the controller database is up and running. The other
publication and subscription databases of existing SMR and MMR systems do not need
to be up and running.
Step 6: As the root account invoke the yum update command to begin the upgrade
from xDB Replication Server 6.1.x to xDB Replication Server 6.2 as shown by the
following:
yum update ppas-xdb*
Be sure to include the asterisk character (*) following ppas-xdb in order to update all
xDB Replication Server components.

At this point the publication server and the subscription server for xDB Replication
Server 6.2 are not running.
The directories now contain the following:
 xDB Replication Server 6.2 is installed in directory location /usr/ppas-xdb-
6.2.
 xDB Replication Server 6.1.x remains in directory location /usr/ppas-xdb-
6.1, but with the files removed from the subdirectories such as bin and lib.

EDB Postgres Replication Server User’s Guide
 In the etc subdirectory, there may be the configuration files renamed as
xdb_pubserver.conf.rpmsave and xdb_subserver.conf.rpmsave.
 In the etc/sysconfig subdirectory, there may be the configuration file
renamed as xdbReplicationServer-61.config.rpmsave.
 In the /etc directory, there may be either one or two xDB Replication
Configuration files named edb-repl.conf and possibly edb-
repl.conf.rpmsave. The file edb-repl.conf should contain the connection
and authentication information for the controller database used by the xDB 6.1.x
publication server. The file edb-repl.conf.rpmsave contains only the new
administrator user parameters admin_user and admin_password. Before
starting the publication server and subscription server, be sure the controller
database is up and running, and the edb-repl.conf file contains the controller
database connection and authentication parameters.
Step 7: Complete the publication server and subscription server configuration file setup.
In the /usr/ppas-xdb-6.2/etc directory, a new set of configuration files for xDB
Replication Server version 6.2 are created. These files are named
xdb_pubserver.conf and xdb_subserver.conf. The new configuration files
contain any new configuration options added for xDB Replication Server 6.2.
The old configuration files used by xDB Replication Server version 6.1.x might be found
in the /usr/ppas-xdb-6.1/etc directory renamed as
xdb_pubserver.conf.rpmsave and xdb_subserver.conf.rpmsave.
Note: If these files do not exist, use the ones you saved in Step 3.
Merge the old and new configuration files so that the resulting, active configuration files
contain any new xDB Replication Server 6.2 configuration options as well as any non-
default settings you used with xDB Replication Server 6.1.x and wish to continue to use
with xDB Replication Server 6.2.
The final set of active configuration files must be contained in directory /usr/ppas-
xdb-6.2/etc named xdb_pubserver.conf and xdb_subserver.conf.
In the /usr/ppas-xdb-6.2/etc/sysconfig directory, make sure the xDB Startup
Configuration file xdbReplicationServer-62.config contains the parameter
settings you wish to use with xDB Replication Server 6.2. See Section 2.3.1.4 for
information on the xDB Startup Configuration file.
Step 8: Restart the publication server and the subscription server (see sections 5.2.1 and
5.3.1).
Step 9: Check the publication server and subscription server log files to verify that no
errors have occurred (see Section 10.3.2.4).

Step 10: Adjust the publication server and subscription server port numbers if necessary.
The xDB Replication Server 6.2 publication and subscription servers are installed to use
the default port numbers 9051 and 9052, respectively. If the xDB Replication Server
6.1.x replication systems used port numbers other than 9051 and 9052 for the
publication and subscription servers, then perform the modifications to correct this
inconsistency as described in Section 10.2.3.
If no such adjustment to the port numbers is needed, register the publication server and
subscription server with the xDB Replication Console as described in sections 5.2.1 and
5.3.1. The existing replication systems should appear in the replication tree of the xDB
Replication Console.
Step 11: You are now ready to use xDB Replication Server 6.2 to create new replication
systems and manage existing ones.
10.2.3 Updating the Publication and Subscription Server Ports
The newly installed publication server and subscription server of xDB Replication Server
6.2 are configured to use the default port numbers 9051 and 9052, respectively. These
port numbers are set in the xDB Startup Configuration file as described in Section
2.3.1.4.
If your xDB Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems were running under port
numbers other than 9051 and 9052, some of your settings in xDB Replication Server 6.2
must be adjusted to continue to use these existing replication systems.
Note: The following changes regarding port 9052 and the subscription server are only
needed if you are running a single-master replication system. If you are using only a
multi-master replication system, then only the changes involving port 9051 and the
publication server are needed.
There are two methods to correct this as summarized by the following two points:
 To continue to use the old port numbers (other than 9051 and 9052) that were in
use for xDB Replication Server 6.1.x, stop the publication and subscription
servers. Change the settings of the PUBPORT and SUBPORT parameters in the xDB
Startup Configuration file from 9051 and 9052 to the old port numbers used by
xDB Replication Server 6.1.x. Restart the publication and subscription servers.
Register the publication server and the subscription server with the old xDB
Replication Server 6.1.x port numbers along with the admin user and password as
described in sections 5.2.1 and 5.3.1.
 To use the default port numbers 9051 and 9052 with the xDB Replication Server
6.1.x replication systems, you must replace the old port numbers with the default
port numbers 9051 and 9052. Register the publication server and the subscription
server with port numbers 9051 and 9052 along with the admin user and password
