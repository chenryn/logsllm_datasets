Abstract
We present novel and practical techniques to accurately
detect IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking attacks in real time to facilitate
mitigation. Attacks may hijack victim’s address space to
disrupt network services or perpetrate malicious activities
such as spamming and DoS attacks without disclosing iden-
tity. We propose novel ways to signi(cid:2)cantly improve the
detection accuracy by combining analysis of passively col-
lected BGP routing updates with data plane (cid:2)ngerprints of
suspicious pre(cid:2)xes. The key insight is to use data plane in-
formation in the form of edge network (cid:2)ngerprinting to dis-
ambiguate suspect IP hijacking incidences based on rout-
ing anomaly detection. Con(cid:3)icts in data plane (cid:2)ngerprints
provide much more de(cid:2)nitive evidence of successful IP pre-
(cid:2)x hijacking. Utilizing multiple real-time BGP feeds, we
demonstrate the ability of our system to distinguish between
legitimate routing changes and actual attacks. Strong cor-
relation with addresses that originate spam emails from a
spam honeypot con(cid:2)rms the accuracy of our techniques.
1. Introduction
Analogous to identity theft, IP address hijacking, also
known as fraudulent origin attack, is to steal IP addresses
belonging to other networks.
It is an attack on the rout-
ing infrastructure or Internet’s control plane. To accomplish
this, attackers announce hijacked address pre(cid:2)xes from net-
works they control, so that they can use the stolen addresses
to send and receive traf(cid:2)c. To simplify, we use the term (cid:147)IP
hijacking(cid:148) to mean hijacking of IP address pre(cid:2)xes.
Attackers may hijack IP address space for two purposes:
(1) To Conduct malicious activities such as spamming and
DoS attacks without worrying about disclosing their iden-
tity through the source IPs. Note that although source IPs
can be easily spoofed due to lack of ubiquitous deployment
of ingress (cid:2)ltering, establishing a TCP connection still re-
quires using a routable IP address.
(2) Intentionally dis-
rupt the communication or reachability of legitimate hosts
numbered with the stolen addresses (cid:150) effectively a more
stealthy type of DoS attack. Both types of hijacking can
signi(cid:2)cantly disrupt the stability and security of the Inter-
net. Moreover, stolen IPs were also found to be sold or
leased to networks in need of IP address spaces [27]. Note
that the symptom of IP hijacking from victim’s perspective
is similar to other outages, making it nontrivial to diagnose.
Besides malicious intent, IP hijacking can also result
from unintentional network miscon(cid:2)gurations. The most
notable example is the incident involving AS7007 [9] which
accidentally advertised to its upstream provider a short path
to numerous pre(cid:2)xes belonging to other networks.
Its
provider did not (cid:2)lter out these bogus announcements caus-
ing a large blackhole for many destinations.
IP hijacking is also known as BGP (Border Gateway Pro-
tocol) hijacking, because to receive traf(cid:2)c destined to hi-
jacked IP addresses, the attacker has to make those IP ad-
dresses known to other parts of the Internet by announcing
them through BGP [41, 28, 21], which is the interdomain
routing protocol on the Internet today. A BGP route con-
sists of a pre(cid:2)x and the AS path used to reach that pre(cid:2)x.
IP hijacking occurs if an AS advertises a pre(cid:2)x that it is not
authorized to use either on purpose or by accident. Because
the current BGP protocol implements little authentication
and often assumes a signi(cid:2)cant level of trust between peer-
ing ASes, IP hijacking can easily succeed. Furthermore,
because a BGP router cannot know routing policies of its
neighbors, nor can it accurately evaluate the validity of a
routing announcement, this leads to signi(cid:2)cant dif(cid:2)culties
in preventing malicious or miscon(cid:2)gured routing informa-
tion from propagating through the entire Internet.
An obvious way to prevent IP hijacking is to ensure
proper con(cid:2)gurations of route (cid:2)lters at the links between
network providers and their customers to preclude cus-
tomers from announcing routes for pre(cid:2)xes they do not
own. However, this is both dif(cid:2)cult and insuf(cid:2)cient: (1)
Providers do not always know which address blocks their
customers are assigned to, due to the prevalence of multi-
homing. This allows customers to obtain address pre(cid:2)xes
from multiple providers. (2) Similar to ingress (cid:2)ltering, as
long as there is one provider that does not properly enforce
route (cid:2)ltering, IP hijacking becomes possible. (3) Compro-
mised routers in the core Internet can bypass such (cid:2)lters, as
route (cid:2)ltering is impossible along peering edges due to lack
of information on addresses allocated to customers belong-
ing to one’s peer, usually one’s competitor.
Given the above dif(cid:2)culties, it is critical to detect and
thwart potential IP hijacking attempts. Some of the ex-
isting work relying on registry information such as whois
database is ineffective due to stale and inaccurate registry
data. Other approaches focus on detecting anomalous con-
trol plane information (cid:150) con(cid:3)icts in origin ASes1 in the
announcements [51] and short-lived nature of routing up-
dates [10]. These suffer from excessive false positives and
false negatives, making them impractical for operational
use. False positives result from legitimate reasons why
seemingly anomalous routing updates occur. False nega-
tives stem from the fundamental observation that the BGP
AS-level path may not match the forwarding path [35].
Moreover, using timing as an anomaly indication further
undermines online mitigation as the detection needs to wait
for the hijacking attempt to disappear.
Our approach to defeating IP hijacking is to (cid:2)rst de-
tect, in real time, routing updates that indicate unautho-
rized announcement of address pre(cid:2)xes. Our key insight
is that a successful hijacking will result in con(cid:3)icting data
plane (cid:2)ngerprints describing the edge networks numbered
with the announced address pre(cid:2)x. This is because dur-
ing a successful hijacking attack, the same pre(cid:2)x will be
announced and used by multiple distinct networks. Thus,
we exploit this fundamental property by light-weight (cid:2)n-
gerprinting that characterizes end-hosts or edge networks
to accurately and ef(cid:2)ciently ascertain IP hijacking attempts
as soon as they occur. Such (cid:2)ngerprints can range from
(cid:2)ne-grained host-based information like the host uptime to
coarse-grained network information such as (cid:2)rewall poli-
cies. Essentially these (cid:2)ngerprints are identifying signature
information for the network using the IP address pre(cid:2)x in
question. Typically a hijacking attempt cannot succeed in
affecting the entire Internet, especially networks topologi-
cally close to the network owning the pre(cid:2)x. A real hijack-
ing routing update thus always generates disagreeing (cid:2)nger-
prints obtained from different network vantage points.
Our work provides real-time detection of IP hijacking
events as soon as they occur instead of post-mortem analysis
common in most previous works. Online detection enables
timely mitigation responses, for example in the form of re-
questing help through external channels. Here are our main
contributions. We present a comprehensive framework for
the attack model of IP hijacking, including attack types pre-
viously overlooked and not addressed. We propose detec-
tion techniques for each IP hijacking attack type based on
several novel techniques such as AS edge popularity check-

when propagating the route.
ing, AS relationship inference, active probing to collect data
plane (cid:2)ngerprints con(cid:2)rming the attacks. Unlike previous
work, our approach signi(cid:2)cantly reduces not only false pos-
itives using a variety of anomaly detection and constraint
checking techniques on routing data, but also false negatives
by successfully detecting previously overlooked IP hijack-
ing types. Overall, we present an ef(cid:2)cient, accurate, and
general IP hijacking detection framework, readily deployed
in today’s Internet, requiring no ISP nor end-host coopera-
tion, and validated using empirical data.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We (cid:2)rst
summarize related work in x2, followed by a description
of a comprehensive classi(cid:2)cation of IP address hijacking in
x3. x4 proposes our detection techniques for each attack
type. To demonstrate the real-time detection capability, we
present experimental results in x5. Validation using empiri-
cal data are shown in x6. Finally, x7 concludes the paper.
2. Related Work
IP hijacking is an attack on BGP. IETF’s rpsec (Routing
Protocol Security Requirements) Working Group provides
general threat information for routing protocols [5] and in
particular BGP security requirements [13]. Pre(cid:2)x origin au-
thentication is one such requirement. Related to it is path
authentication. As explained later, malicious AS inserted in
the AS path can achieve similar damage as fraudulent origin
ASes. A recent survey [11] gives a comprehensive overview
on BGP security.
According to RFC1930 [23], a pre(cid:2)x is usually origi-
nated by a single AS. MOAS (Multiple Origin AS) con-
(cid:3)icts result if multiple origin ASes announce the same pre-
(cid:2)x. Zhao et al. (cid:2)rst coined the term MOAS, providing
several legitimate explanations for them aside from mis-
con(cid:2)guration and hijacking attacks [51]. Their subsequent
work [52] suggested the use of BGP community attribute
storing a list of originating ASes to detect potential viola-
tions. However, such a list is unauthenticated and optional,
thus cannot ensure accurate detection of IP address hijack-
ing. To protect routes to speci(cid:2)c services such as DNS,
Wang et al. [48] proposes preferring known stable routes
over transient routes. Nevertheless, this approach does not
scale to arbitrary routes.
The well-known BGP security architecture S-BGP [45]
relies on digitally signed routing updates to ensure integrity
and authenticity, assuming the presence of PKIs. Follow-
up work such as psBGP [47] and [50] improve the ef(cid:2)-
ciency of S-BGP. Both S-BGP and SoBGP [36] can de-
fend against IP address hijacking attacks. However, their
high overhead in terms of computational cost, modi(cid:2)cation
of protocol and additional management overhead prevents
their rapid deployment. The Interdomain Routing Valida-
tion (IRV) project [20] uses an out-of-band mechanism to
validate received routing information by querying the IRV
server in the relevant AS. However, it does not prevent an
AS from originating a pre(cid:2)x it does not own. The Listen
and Whisper scheme [46] also helps identify inconsistent
routing advertisement, but does not deterministically detect
IP hijacking attacks. Similar to our approach, it takes ad-
vantage of data plane information. Complimentary to our
techniques, the recent work by Aiello et al. [4] investigates
the semantics, design, and application of origin authentica-
tion services by formalizing address delegation semantics
and exploring the use of various cryptographic structures
for asserting block ownership and delegation.
Compared to these related work, our approach focuses
on practical, readily deployable mechanisms using data
plane information to validate occurrences of IP hijacking
in real time. Many operational requirements for secured
BGP have not been addressed [8], hindering the deploy-
ment of solutions such as S-BGP. In contrast, our solution
can be incrementally, easily deployed by end hosts, requir-
ing no additional infrastructure, no modi(cid:2)cations to BGP or
routers, nor ISP cooperation. Our work improves and uti-
lizes routing anomaly detection techniques, such as those
by Kruegel et al. [32] for narrowing down suspicious in-
cidents based on edge network (cid:2)ngerprinting. Essentially
we combine anomaly detection of control plane information
i.e., routing updates with more conclusive con(cid:3)icting data-
plane (cid:2)ngerprints associated with the network in question.
In the area of routing anomaly detection and comple-
mentary to our work is the recent paper by Lad et al. [33]
which noti(cid:2)es the pre(cid:2)x owners, in real time, of occur-
rences of new origin ASes. This method nevertheless can
be evaded as changes in origin AS is not necessary for hi-
jacking attacks. Recent work by Qiu et al. [39] using co-
operation among ASes for detection suffers from the same
shortcoming. Our approach is more general and identi-
(cid:2)es all possible hijacking attack types as described in x3.
Boothe et al. [10] recently presented detection based on
heuristics of short-lived MOAS con(cid:3)icts, similar to [26].
However timing-based methods is not real-time and may be
quite inaccurate due to evasion.
Finally, our work bene(cid:2)ts signi(cid:2)cantly from various (cid:2)n-
gerprinting approaches to characterize end hosts and net-
works: e.g., OS-based (cid:2)ngerprinting such as nmap [16] and
xprobe2 [49], physical device (cid:2)ngerprinting by identifying
clock skews [31], timestamp-based information using TCP
and ICMP timestamp probing, as well as IP ID probing used
for counting hosts behind NAT [7].
3. An Attack Model of IP Hijacking
We (cid:2)rst provide a classi(cid:2)cation of IP hijacking scenar-
ios. The comprehensive attack taxonomy provides the foun-
dation for our discussion on detection, the explanation for
attacker’s motivations, and possible evasion attempts. Pre-
vious taxonomy [33] addressed only a subset of the attacks.
3.1. Type 1: Hijack a preﬂx
The most direct way to hijack a pre(cid:2)x is to announce the
ownership of IP pre(cid:2)xes that belong to some victim ASes.
The BGP neighbors subsequently propagate the route, if
it is selected as the best path. Combining routing feeds
from multiple vantage points will reveal an MOAS con-
(cid:3)ict [51], i.e., a pre(cid:2)x with con(cid:3)icting origin ASes. As
an example, there are two AS paths to reach pre(cid:2)x P1,
namely fAS1; AS2; ¢ ¢ ¢ ASng and fAS 0
2; ¢ ¢ ¢ ; ASmg.
An MOAS con(cid:3)ict occurs if ASn 6= ASm. MOAS is only
one possible indication of IP hijacking. There are also valid
reasons for MOAS. Therefore detecting MOAS alone serves
only as one possible starting point, and we focus on distin-
guishing IP hijacking from legitimate MOAS cases. We de-
scribe two most common legitimate reasons as illustrated in
Figures 1 (a),(b), with the attack shown in Figure 1 (c).
1; AS 0
† Multi-homing with static links: An AS X uses
statically con(cid:2)gured route to connect to one of its
providers, AS Y . AS X uses BGP to connect to an-
other provider. If the same pre(cid:2)x is announced to both
providers, it will appear to have two origin ASes: X
and Y .
† Multi-homing with private AS numbers: A cus-
tomer may use BGP to connect to its providers with
a private AS number due to shortage of AS numbers.
Upon receiving the advertised routes, the provider will
eliminate the private AS in the AS paths before an-
nouncing them externally. If a pre(cid:2)x is announced to
both providers, it will appear to originate directly from
the providers, resulting in an MOAS con(cid:3)ict.
Other less common valid reasons for MOAS include Inter-
net Exchange Point (IXP) Addresses, address aggregation,
and IP anycast [51]. IP hijacking and router miscon(cid:2)gura-
tions can also lead to MOAS con(cid:3)icts. The fundamental dif-
(cid:2)culty arises from the lack of authoritative information on
address ownership. Therefore, IP hijacking cannot be iden-
ti(cid:2)ed by simply observing MOAS cases alone as in most
previous work which suffers from signi(cid:2)cant false positives.
In x4, we develop an accurate algorithm to distinguish IP hi-
jacking using data plane information.
3.2. Type 2: Hijack a preﬂx and its AS
Despite several valid reasons for MOAS con(cid:3)icts, they
could still be considered as possible abnormal BGP behav-
ior, requiring further investigation. Stealthy attackers can
avoid MOAS by advertising a route to the stolen pre(cid:2)x with
