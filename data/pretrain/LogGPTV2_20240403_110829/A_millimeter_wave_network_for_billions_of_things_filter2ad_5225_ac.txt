shown that NLoS paths typically experiences 10-20 dB higher at-
tenuation than LOS path, and a blocked path typically experiences
10-15 dB higher attenuation than NLoS path [4]. Therefore, when
both LoS and NLoS paths are available, the SNR will be 10-20 dB.
When the LoS path is blocked and only the NLoS path is available,
SNR reduces to 10-15 dB. Finally, when the LoS path is available
and the NLoS path is blocked, the SNR can be up to 35 dB.
6.2 Orthogonal Beam Patterns
So far, we have described how mmX’s nodes communicate to mmX’s
AP by transmitting a simple sine wave to two different beams which
experience different path loss. However, there is a chance that the
two paths experience similar loss, and as a result, signal levels will
be the same and the AP will not be able to decode the signal using
ASK demodulation.
Figure 5(a) shows an example of such a scenario. Here, the AP
is in the middle of two beams and therefore the two NLoS paths
experience similar attenuation. To prevent such scenarios from
happening, we need to carefully design mmX’s beam patterns. Es-
sentially, we need to design two radiation beams that are orthogonal
to each other while they cover a large area. Orthogonality means
each beam has nulls at the main direction of the other beam. Fig-
ure 5(b) shows our proposed beam patterns. The direction of the
first beam (Beam 1) is on the broadside direction and perpendicular
to the transmitter board, and the second beam (Beam 0) is divided
into two directions. Further, Beam 0 has a null on the broadside
direction, as such, Beam 1 and Beam 0 are orthogonal to each other.
To implement these two beams mmX uses two different antenna
arrays. Each antenna array includes two patch antennas. The array
with the broadside beam (Beam 1) excites the patches with the
same phase, while the array with null on the broadside (Beam 0)
excites the two patches with 180o phase difference. The 180o phase
difference creates a null in the broadside and produces two peaks
at about ±30o. In addition, the distance between antenna elements
corresponding to Beam 1 is properly designed to create a null at
±30o, so that the two beams are orthogonal to each other.
It is
worth mentioning that using the orthogonal beam pattern not only
reduces the probability of getting similar losses for the two beams
but also increases the coverage angle. Therefore, using orthogonal
beam increases the robustness of our system and also allows us to
cover wider angles.
6.3 Joint ASK-FSK Modulation
To this point, we have explained how we can improve the perfor-
mance of mmX in decoding the signal by designing orthogonal
beam patterns. However, our empirical results show that there is
still a small chance (<10%) that the received power from Beam 1 and
Beam 0 experiences the same loss. In this case, the receiver will not
be able to differentiate the difference between the two levels and
cannot decode the bits. To solve this issue, we propose to combine
ASK and FSK modulations, where the signal is decoded using both
amplitude and frequency differences. Specifically, the frequency of
the tone transmitted by Beam 1 will be slightly different from the
frequency of the tone transmitted by Beam 0. The slight change
in the frequency of the carrier signal can be simply implemented

(b) Line-of-sight is blocked

(OTAM) technique. mmX’s nodes exploit blockage limitation and
high attenuation property of mmWave to create ASK modulations
over the air, eliminating the need for beam searching.
on the reflection from the environment. Therefore, by switching
between these two beams, the node can modulate the amplitude
of the carrier frequency and create ASK signal at the receiver. For
example, if the node want to transmit bit stream: 101, it sends its
carrier signal to Beam 1, then it switches to beam 0 and finally
it switches back to Beam 1. The receiver receives a carrier signal
where its amplitude is modulated by the path loss. Because the loss
of the two paths are sufficiently different, the receiver can easily
decode the bits by monitoring the signal amplitude.
Now let’s consider the second scenario. As shown in Figure 4(b),
due to mobility or environmental change, if the LoS path gets
blocked by an object, the signal from Beam 1 will be attenuated
much more than the signal from Beam 0 which relies on the reflec-
tion from the environment. Therefore, although the node transmits
a pure sine wave (i.e., a carrier signal), the AP receives an ASK
modulated signal since the two paths experience different losses.
Note that in this scenario, as shown in Figure 4 (b), all bits are in-
verted. Therefore, in order to decode the bits, a few training bits are
used at the beginning of each packet. Specifically, similar to most
wireless communication systems, each mmX’s packet has known
preamble bits. These bits are used to distinguish the signal of Beam
0 from Beam 1. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the OTAM tech-
nique works since mmWave signal attenuation in LoS path, NLoS

(a) Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) mmX divides
the available spectrum between nodes depending on their data rate
demand. For example, the available unlicensed spectrum at 24 GHz
and 60 GHz are 250 MHz and 7GHz wide, respectively. These bands
are wide enough to support many nodes while providing each with
10-100s of MHz channel bandwidth. The channels are specified by
the AP to each node in the initialization stage. The initialization
takes place only once using a WiFi or Bluetooth module.
(b) Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM) In scenarios where
the total demanded bandwidth by the nodes is more than the avail-
able spectrum, mmX uses SDM to support all nodes, simultaneously.
The directionality property of mmWave communication allows
mmX to perform a spatial reuse of the spectrum, making the spec-
trum usage much more efficient. Specifically, since the number of
paths between a node and AP is sparse and the signal is directional,
most nodes do not create interference to each other over the air.
However, if no multiplexing technique is used, the received signals
are combined at the AP’s antenna and interfere with each other.
As a result, a spatial multiplexing technique is required in order to
separate the signal. There are two different techniques for doing
this: Hybrid MIMO Array and Time Modulated Array (TMA).
Hybrid MIMO Array: In this approach, the AP uses multiple
mmWave chains connected to one or multiple arrays which create
independent beams toward different directions [29]. This allows
the AP to reuse the spectrum by performing Multiple-Input and
Multiple-Output (MIMO), and hence enabling multiple nodes to
communicate to an AP using the same frequency channel. However,
since this architecture requires multiple mmWave chains, it is power
hungry and costly for IoT applications.
Time Modulated Array (TMA): Instead of using multiple mmWave
chains to separate the signals, another approach is to use TMA [34].
In this approach, an array of antennas, with each element connected
to a switch, is used. The outputs of these switches are combined
and fed to a single mmWave chain. By using a proper switching
sequence, the signals on the same frequency channel, but arriv-
ing from different directions, can be shifted to different frequency
channels. In other words, TMA hashes the signals arriving from
different directions into different frequency bands, as shown in
Figure 6. To understand how TMA works, let’s consider an antenna
array with N elements. The output of TMA for a signal arriving
from direction θ can be written as:
wn(t).e j ω0
y(θ, t) = r(θ, t).
c nd .sinθ ,
(1)
where r(θ, t) is the arriving signal, ω0 is the carrier frequency, c
is the speed of light, d is the spacing between the elements of the
array and wn(t), is a periodic signal that controls the switches and
can be presented as follows:
n=0
wn(t) =
n < t < t

Since wn(t) is a periodic signal, it can be represented by its Fourier
series as follows:

by changing the control voltage of the VCO. Note that FSK or ASK
alone is not sufficient to decode the signal in all scenarios. Specifi-
cally, when the signals of Beam 0 and Beam 1 experience different
path losses, the signal for one beam may be completely lost, and
hence FSK demodulation does not work. In these cases, the signal is
decoded using ASK demodulation, as shown in Figure 9(a). On the
other hand, in rare cases, the signals of Beam 0 and Beam 1 might
experience similar path losses. Therefore, the signals of Beam 0 and
Beam 1 have similar amplitude, and ASK demodulation does not
work. In these cases, the signal is decoded using FSK demodulation,
as shown figure 9(b)) Therefore, utilizing joint ASK-FSK modula-
tions is essential in order to decode the signal in all scenarios.
7 SUPPORTING MULTIPLE NODES
We explained how a single mmX’node communicates to an AP.
In this section, we explain how mmX enables multiple nodes to
communicate to an AP, simultaneously. mmX uses spacial-division
and frequency-division multiplexing to enable simultaneous com-
munication to all nodes. In the following section, we discuss them
in greater details.

maximum output power of this component is 12 dBm, which elimi-
nates the need for a power amplifier. For the switch, we have used
ADRF 5020 SPDT from Analog Devices [12]. The switch has low
insertion loss (<2dB) and high isolation (65 dB) between output
ports which provides a great performance for our application.
As mentioned in Section 5, the two outputs of the SPDT switch
are connected to two antenna arrays that have orthogonal radiation
beams, which means each array has a null at the direction of the
main beam of the other. The radiated power by the antenna is
10 dBm which complies with FCC regulations. Each antenna array
includes two patch antennas. The first array excites the patches
with the same phase, creating the broadside beam (Beam 1). The
second array excites the two patches with 180o phase difference.
The 180o phase difference creates a two-arm beam (Beam 0) which
has a null in the broadside and produces two peaks at about ±30o.
The measured radiation patterns of the designed array is shown in
Figure 8, where Beam 1 is directed toward the broadside, orthogonal
to Beam 0. The Beam 0 is pointing toward ±30 and has a null on
the broadside direction.
8.2 mmX’s Access Point
The block diagram of the mmX’s AP is shown in Figure 3, which
includes a mmWave down-converter board and a baseband pro-
cessor. For the baseband processor, we used N210 USRP from TI
with CBX daughter-board, which covers DC to 6 GHz RF carrier.
The mmWave down-converter first amplifies the received 24 GHz
signal with an LNA. We used HMC 751 from Analog Devices, which
provides about 25 dB gain with only 2 dB noise figure at 24 GHz.
The LNA is placed at the first stage to reduce the total noise fig-
ure of the receiver. To reduce the possible interference from the
out of band sources, we designed a coupled line microstrip filter.
The center frequency of the filter is at 24 GHz and the insertion
loss at the passband is 5 dB. For the LO generator, we used the
evaluation kit for ADF5356, generating a 10GHz signal which will
be doubled by the sub-harmonic mixer. We use HMC264LC3B as
a sub-harmonic mixer, which down convert the 24 GHz received
signal to 4 GHz. For the AP’s antennas, we designed and fabricated
dipole antennas working at 24 GHz, with 5 dB gain and 3 dB beam
width of 62 degree.
9 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We evaluated the performance of mmX in both line-of-sight and
non-line-of sight scenarios. We ran experiments in a lab area with
standard furniture such as desks, chairs, computers and closets.
9.1 Microbenchmaks
Transmitter Performance: As described in Section 8, the node’s
radio has only two components: a VCO which generated the carrier
signal, and a switch. Figure 7 shows the frequency of the VCO
versus its control voltage. The VCO covers 23.95 GHz to 24.25 GHz
by tuning the control voltage from 3.5 V to 4.9 V. The provided
frequency range covers the entire 24 GHz ISM band, therefore
mmX’s node can tune its frequency to any channel assigned to
it by the AP. The figure also shows that the frequency can be
slightly altered by changing the control voltage. This allows mmX
