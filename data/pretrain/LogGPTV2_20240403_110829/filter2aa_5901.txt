# How to Gather WHOIS Information

## Overview
This document provides an in-depth guide on how to gather WHOIS information, which is crucial for both legitimate and malicious purposes. It explains the methods used by attackers to exploit WHOIS data and offers strategies to protect your organization from such threats. While this documentation primarily focuses on Linux/Unix environments, it also includes relevant information for Windows users.

## WHOIS Searches
WHOIS searches allow the public to access a wide range of information about domain names, including the domain registrant, expiration date, creation date, name servers, and contact details. However, this information can also be misused by attackers to launch targeted attacks. This section will cover:

- The types of information available through WHOIS searches.
- How attackers use WHOIS data to gain unauthorized access to networks.
- Best practices to protect your organization from WHOIS-based attacks.

### Types of Information Available
- **Registrant Information**: Details about the individual or organization that owns the domain.
- **Domain Expiration and Creation Dates**: Important for understanding the domain's lifecycle.
- **Name Servers**: DNS servers that manage the domain.
- **Contact Information**: Email addresses and phone numbers for administrative, technical, and billing contacts.

### How Attackers Use WHOIS Data
Attackers often use WHOIS data to:
- Identify potential targets and their vulnerabilities.
- Conduct social engineering attacks by impersonating trusted entities.
- Perform reconnaissance to plan more sophisticated attacks, such as DNS cache poisoning.

### Protecting Your Organization
To safeguard your organization, consider the following measures:
- **Use WHOIS Privacy Services**: These services hide your personal and organizational information from public WHOIS records.
- **Regularly Monitor WHOIS Records**: Ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Implement Strong Security Practices**: Educate employees about the risks of social engineering and other cyber threats.

## Querying a WHOIS Database
A WHOIS lookup returns detailed information about a domain, including associated entities. To perform a WHOIS query, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ whois google.com -h whois.arin.net
```

### Example Output
```
Whois Server Version 2.0
Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registered
with many different competing registrars. Go to http://www.internic.net
for detailed information.

To single out one record, look it up with "xxx", where xxx is one of the
records displayed above. If the records are the same, look them up
with "=xxx" to receive a full display for each record.

### Additional Information Returned by WHOIS Queries
|Query Type|Data Returned|Potential Misuse|
|:---------|:------------|:---------------|
|Address - Country|Location of Target|Physical security, dumpster diving, social engineering|
|Net Range - Name Servers|Internet Addressing Scheme|Targeting, zone transfers (IXFR, AXFR)|
|Registration Update & Expiry|Date formats & Times|Social engineering, DNS cache poisoning|
|RTech handle - Rtech Email|Admin Contact Info|First/Last name, social engineering, reverse engineering, email contact, possible phone contact, home location|

### Additional Resources for WHOIS Gathering and Data Mining
|Resource|Information Gained|Information Used for|
|:-------|:-----------------|:-------------------|
|Social Media (MySpace, Facebook, etc.)|Targets' profiles, likes, dislikes, vulnerabilities|Social/reverse engineering, leveraging access, passive information gathering|
|Corporate BBS, Google Searches for Help, IT/IS Vendor Searches|Specific problems, help documentation, techs involved, solutions|Social/reverse engineering, usernames for brute force, minor network mapping|
|Job Search Websites (Monster, Dice, etc.)|Architecture, contact information, geographic location|Reverse/social engineering, gaining temporary access, understanding physical security|

By understanding the potential risks and taking proactive measures, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of WHOIS-based attacks and protect your organization's valuable assets.
