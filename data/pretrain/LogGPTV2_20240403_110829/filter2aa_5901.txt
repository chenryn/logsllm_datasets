# How to gather whois information ?
- Whois Searches
- Querying a Whois Database
Information in regard to whois gathering and how attackers use the information use the information that is displayed in whois records against unsuspecting organizational members, leaders and employees. This documentation touches the windows side of whois information gathering. This documentation is intended more for Linux / Unix users than for Windows.
## Whois Searches
whois searches allow the general public to search for information based on the grounds of, who web locations are registered to, expiry records, when a domain has been created, name servers and contact information. However whois information can also aid attackers in obtaining information to help launch a successful penetration into a network.
The documentation contained here will describe the venues in which an attacker will undergo in order to successfully obtain information to breach into a network using such details. We will also show you how to protect your organization and organizational information from such attacks. This document will cover details of what the attacker will perform when attempting to penetrate or gain information from whois records which may help them in successfully breaching your security.
## Querying a Whois Database
A whois look up will return information about the target company. Using this type of query you can also search for other entities associated with the target company. To perform the whois query against a remote host an attacker will issue the following command whois target-server.com -h whois.crsnic.net -H, this output will produce the following data:
```
$ whois google.com -h whois.arin.net

Domain names in the .com and .net domains can now be registered
with many different competing registrars. Go to http://www.internic.net
