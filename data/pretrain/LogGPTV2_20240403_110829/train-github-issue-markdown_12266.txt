I've got an opaque string type. We basically use this type for things that are
strings under the hood, but shouldn't be interchanged with actual free text
strings- for example GUIDs. We also use the nominal type checking hack with
the private void property to nominally type check them.
We have a problem, though, which is that the compiler won't permit them as
dictionary keys.
Can we permit a type annotation or something to say that the type is really a
string or integer under the hood and should be permitted as a dictionary key?
