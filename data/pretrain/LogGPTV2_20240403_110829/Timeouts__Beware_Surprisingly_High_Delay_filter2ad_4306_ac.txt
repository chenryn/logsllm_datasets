### Table 2: Minimum Timeout in Seconds for Capturing c% of Pings from r% of IP Addresses

Table 2 shows the minimum timeout in seconds required to capture c% of pings from r% of IP addresses in the IT63w (20150117) and IT63c (20150206) datasets, where r is the row number and c is the column number.

However, a significant fraction of IP addresses exhibit surprisingly high latencies. For example, capturing 95% of pings from 95% of addresses requires a 5-second timeout. This implies that at least 5% of pings from 5% of addresses have latencies exceeding 5 seconds. Therefore, even with a 5-second timeout, a false loss rate of 5% can be inferred for these addresses.

It is important to note that retrying lost pings is not an effective substitute for setting a longer timeout, as a retried ping is not an independent sample of latency. The factors causing the initial delay are likely to affect subsequent pings similarly, as discussed in Section 6.

In extreme cases, 1% of pings from 1% of addresses have latencies above 145 seconds. These extremely high latencies warrant further investigation. We consider a 60-second timeout to be a reasonable balance between progress and response rate, especially when studying outages and latencies. A 60-second timeout covers 98% of pings to 98% of addresses without unnecessarily slowing down measurements.

### 5. Verification of Long Ping Times

#### 5.1 Are High Latencies Observed by Other Probing Schemes?

Given the high latencies observed in Table 2, we considered whether they might be artifacts of ISI’s probing scheme. To investigate this, we examined latencies obtained using two other probing techniques: Zmap and scamper.

##### Does Zmap Observe High Latencies?

We used the Zmap scanner [5] to check for high latencies. As part of our extension of the ICMP probing module in Zmap, we embedded the probe send time into the echo request and extracted it from the echo response, allowing us to estimate the Round-Trip Time (RTT) with some precision.

Zmap has conducted scans since April 2015, with scans performed at various times and days of the week across four months in 2015 (as of September 5, 2015), as shown in Table 3. Typically, scans were conducted on Sundays or Thursdays, beginning at noon UTC time, though some scans were conducted at different times and days to increase diversity. Each Zmap scan takes approximately 10.5 hours to complete and recovers Echo Responses from around 350 million addresses.

Figure 7: Distribution of RTTs for all Zmap scans performed in 2015. Around 5% of addresses have latencies greater than 1 second in each scan, and 0.1% of addresses observed latencies in excess of 75 seconds.

Most responses arrived with low latency, with a median latency lower than 250 ms for each scan. However, 5% of addresses responded with RTTs greater than 1 second in each scan. Further, 0.1% of addresses responded with latencies exceeding 75 seconds in each scan, although the 99.9th percentile latency showed some variation. The May 22 scan had the lowest 99.9th percentile latency (77 seconds), while the July 9 scan had the highest (102 seconds). These nearly identical latency distributions suggest that high latencies are persistent for a consistent fraction of addresses.

##### Does Scamper Also Observe High Latencies?

Both ISI and Zmap probe millions of addresses, and we investigated whether latencies are affected by these probing schemes triggering rate limits or firewalls. We selected a small sample of addresses likely to have high latencies from the ISI dataset, probed them using scamper [13], and checked for unusually high latencies.

In the 2011-2013 ISI dataset, 20,095 IP addresses had at least 5% of their pings with latencies of 100 seconds or more. We chose 2,000 random IP addresses from this subset and sent 1,000 pings to them, once every 10 seconds using scamper [13]. In this analysis, we used scamper’s default packet response matching mechanism, which ceases to run 2 seconds after the last packet is sent, potentially missing responses to the last few pings.

Of the 2,000 addresses, 1,244 responded to our probes. Figure 8 shows the percentile latency per IP address. The 95th percentile latency for 50% of the addresses is now considerably lower, at 7.3 seconds. This suggests that addresses prone to extremely high latencies vary over time, and we investigate addresses with this behavior further in Section 6.

Figure 8: Confirmation of high latency: Percentile latency per IP address for 2,000 randomly chosen IP addresses from ISI’s 2011-2013 surveys that had > 5% of pings with latencies of 100 seconds or more. 17% of them continue to observe 1% of their pings with latencies > 100 seconds.

Scamper also observes some instances of very high latencies. 17% of addresses observe latencies greater than 100 seconds for 1% of their pings. This rules out the possibility that high latencies are a product of the probing scheme.

#### 5.2 Is It a Particular Survey or Vantage Point?

ISI survey data are collected from four vantage points at different times: Marina del Rey, California ("w"); Ft. Collins, Colorado ("c"); Fujisawa-shi, Kanagawa, Japan ("j"); and Athens, Greece ("g").

In this section, we look at summary metrics of each of the surveys. Figure 9 shows the consistency of values: the median ping from the median address remains near 200 ms for the duration. However, there are exceptions in the following datasets: IT59j (20140515), IT60j (20140723), IT61j (20141002), and IT62g (20141210). These higher sampled latencies coincide with a substantial reduction in the fraction of responses that are matched: in typical ISI surveys, 20% of pings receive a response; in these, between 0.02% and 0.2% see a response. These datasets should not be considered further. Additionally, it54c (20130524), it54j (20130618), and it54w (20130430) were flagged by ISI as having high latency variation due to a software error [11].

Ignoring the outliers, trends are apparent. The timeout necessary to capture 95% of responses from 95% of addresses increased from near two seconds in 2007 to near five seconds in 2011. The 98th percentile latency from the 98th percentile address has increased steadily since 2011, and the 99th increased from a modest 20 seconds in 2011 to a surprising 140 seconds in 2013. These latency observations are not isolated to individual traces.

In summary, high latency is increasing, and although some surveys show atypical statistics, early 2015 datasets appear typical of expected performance.

#### 5.3 Is It ICMP?

One might expect that high latencies could result from preferential treatment against ICMP. RFC 1812 allows routers responding to ICMP to rate-limit replies [1,12], but this limitation should not substantially affect the results since each address is meant to receive a ping from ISI once every eleven minutes. Nevertheless, firewalls or similar devices might interfere specifically with ICMP.

To evaluate this possibility, we selected high-latency addresses from the IT63c (20150206) survey. We sent a probe stream consisting of three ICMP echo requests separated by one second, then 20 minutes later, three UDP messages separated by one second, and again 20 minutes later, three TCP ACK probes separated by one second. We avoided TCP SYNs because they may appear to be associated with security vulnerability scanning.

We chose the top 5% of addresses when sorting by each of the median, 80th, 90th, and 95th percentile latencies. Many of these sets of addresses overlap, but we considered these different sets important to include both hosts with high persistent latency and those with high occasional latency. After sampling 15,000 addresses from each of these four sets and removing duplicates, we obtained 53,875 addresses to probe.

From these addresses, only 5,219 responded to all probes from all protocols on April 29, 2015. This is somewhat expected, as only 27,579 responded to any probe from any protocol.

To complete the probing, we used Scamper [13] to send the probe stream to each of the candidate addresses. Note that scamper uses a 2-second timeout by default, although the timeout can be configured. Instead of setting an alternate timeout in Scamper, we ran tcpdump to collect all received packets, effectively creating an "indefinite" timeout. This allowed us to observe packets that arrive arbitrarily late.

Figure 10: 98th percentile RTTs associated with high-latency IP addresses using different probe protocols. The first probe of a triplet (seq 0) often has a higher latency than the rest; TCP probes appear to have a similar distribution except for firewall-sourced responses.

For each protocol, we selected the 98th percentile RTT per address and plotted the distribution in Figure 10. We noticed two obvious features of the data: the first packet of the triplet often had a noticeably different distribution of round trip times, and the TCP responses often had a mode around 200 ms. We will investigate the "first ping" problem in Section 6.3.

The TCP responses appear to be generated by firewalls that recognize that the acknowledgment is not part of a connection and send a RST without notifying the actual destination. This cluster of responses all had the same TTL and applied to all probes to entire /24 blocks.

Ignoring the quick TCP responses apparently from a firewall, it does not appear that any protocol has significant preferential treatment among the high-latency hosts. Our assertion is that such prioritization, if it exists, is not a source of the substantial latencies we observe.

#### 5.4 Summary

In this section, we confirmed that extremely high latencies are also observed by techniques besides ISI’s. We found that the high latencies are not a result of a few individual ISI datasets, even though some did appear atypical. Further, high latencies affect all protocols similarly.

We also found that the prevalence of high latencies has been increasing since 2011. In 2015, a consistent 5% of addresses have latencies greater than a second.

### 6. Why Do Pings Take So Long?

In this section, we aim to determine what causes high RTTs. We investigate the RTTs of satellite links and find that they account for a small fraction of high RTT addresses. We follow up with an analysis of Autonomous Systems and geographic locations that are most prone to two potentially different types of high RTTs: RTTs greater than 1 second and RTTs greater than 100 seconds. We then investigate addresses that exhibit each type of RTT and find potential explanations.

#### 6.1 Are Satellites Involved?

A reasonable hypothesis is that satellite links, widely known for their necessarily high minimum latency, would also be responsible for very high maximum latencies. Transmissions via geosynchronous satellite must transit 35,786 km to the satellite and back, resulting in a minimum round-trip time of about 239 ms. However, satellite links typically do not account for the extremely high latencies observed.

Figure 11: Scatterplot of 1st and 99th percentile latencies for addresses with high values of both in survey IT63c; Left omits satellite-only ISPs; Right includes only satellite-only ISPs.

The scatterplot in Figure 11 shows that satellite links contribute to high latencies but do not fully explain the extremely high latencies observed.
