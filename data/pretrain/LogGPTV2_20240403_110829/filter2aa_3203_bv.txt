that you have configured on the computer.  
Local Area Network (LAN)  The rule applies only to communications sent through LAN connections 
that you have configured on the computer.  
Remote Access  The rule applies only to communications sent through any remote access or dial-up 
connections that you have configured on the computer.

IPsec for IPv6 Traffic 
Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 include the same support for IPv6 traffic as IPv4 traffic. You 
can use either the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security or IP Security Policy Management snap-
ins to configure IPsec settings to protect IPv6 traffic. 
However, the IPv6 protocol for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP has the following limitations: 
Supports AH in transport or tunnel mode using MD5 or SHA1 and ESP in transport or tunnel mode 
using the NULL ESP header and MD5 or SHA1. IPv6 does not support ESP data encryption.  
Is separate from—and not interoperable with—IPsec for the IPv4 protocol. IPsec policies that are 
configured with IP Security Policies or Group Policy have no effect on IPv6 traffic.  
Does not support the use of IKE to negotiate SAs. You must use the Ipsec6.exe tool to manually 
configure IPsec policies, SAs, and encryption keys. For more information, see Help and Support in 
Windows XP or Windows Server 2003.

Packet Filtering 
In addition to using IPsec filter actions to perform packet filtering, computers running Windows Vista, 
Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 support Windows Firewall. Computers 
running Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP also support the Internet Connection Firewall and 
TCP/IP filtering. 
On computers running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 with Routing and Remote 
Access, you can also use IP packet filtering. On computers running Windows Server 2003 with no 
service packs installed and Routing and Remote Access, you can also use the Basic Firewall 
component. 
Windows Firewall 
A firewall is a protective boundary between a computer or network and the outside world. Windows 
Firewall is a stateful host firewall for IPv4 and IPv6 traffic in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, 
Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later, and Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) 
and later. This feature allows incoming traffic only if it is either solicited (sent in response to a request of 
the computer) or excepted (unsolicited traffic that has been specified as allowable). Windows Firewall 
provides a level of protection from malicious users and programs that use unsolicited traffic to attack 
computers. Windows Firewall in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 can also block outgoing 
traffic. Windows Firewall in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 does not block outgoing traffic, with 
the exception of some Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages. 
Windows Firewall is designed for use on all network connections, including those that are accessible 
from the Internet, connected to small office/home office networks, or connected to private organization 
networks. An organization network's firewall, proxy, and other security systems provide some level of 
protection from the Internet to intranet network computers. However, the absence of host firewalls such 
as Windows Firewall on intranet connections leaves computers vulnerable to malicious programs 
brought onto the intranet by mobile computers. 
For example, an employee connects an organization laptop to a home network that does not have 
adequate protections. Because the organization laptop does not have a host firewall enabled on its 
network connection, the laptop gets infected with a malicious program (such as a virus or worm) that 
uses unsolicited traffic to spread to other computers. The employee then brings the infected laptop back 
to the office and connects it to the organization intranet, effectively bypassing the security systems that 
are at the edge of the intranet. While connected to the intranet, the malicious program begins to infect 
other computers. If Windows Firewall were enabled by default, the laptop computer might not get 
infected with the malicious program when connected to the home network. Even if the laptop computer 
did get infected, the local intranet computers might not become infected when the laptop computer 
connected to the intranet, because they also have Windows Firewall enabled. 
If the computers running Windows are running client-based programs, enabling Windows Firewall does 
not impair communications. Web access, e-mail, Group Policy, and management agents that request 
updates from a management server are examples of client-based programs. For client-based 
programs, the client computer always initiates the communication, and the firewall allows all response 
traffic from a server because it is solicited incoming traffic. 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 385 
In Windows Vista, Windows XP with SP2 and later, and Windows Server 2008, Windows Firewall is 
enabled by default on all network connections. For Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, you can 
configure exceptions (known as rules) from the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in or 
from commands in the netsh advfirewall context. 
Configuring Rules with the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security Snap-in 
Inbound and outbound traffic rules in the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in specify 
what traffic to allow or block, and provide a highly simplified way to configure exception settings. There 
is a default set of inbound and outbound rules that you can enable, disable, or customize.  
To enable an existing rule, right-click the rule in the list of rules, and then click Enable Rule. To disable 
an existing rule, right-click the rule, and then click Disable Rule. To modify an existing rule, double-click 
the rule and configure its settings. Predefined rules can only be enabled or disabled, not modified. 
To create a new rule, do the following: 
1. From the console tree of the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in, right-click Inbound 
Rules or Outbound Rules, and then click New Rule. 
2. Follow the pages of the New Inbound Rule or New Outbound Rule wizard to configure a rule for a 
common scenario or a custom rule. 
Configuring Windows Firewall with Control Panel 
For the Windows Firewall in Windows XP with Service Pack 2 (SP2) and later and Windows 
Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later, you can configure exceptions from the Windows 
Firewall item in Control Panel. Figure 13-12 shows the Windows Firewall dialog box that was 
introduced in Windows XP with SP2. 
Figure 13-12  The Windows Firewall dialog box in Windows XP with SP2 
The Windows Firewall dialog box has the following tabs: 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 386 
The General tab, from which you can enable, enable but do not allow any exceptions, or disable 
Windows Firewall. 
The Exceptions tab, from which you can specify exceptions for allowed incoming traffic. You can 
specify these exceptions by TCP or UDP port or by program name. 
The Advanced tab, from which you can enable and disable Windows Firewall on individual interfaces, 
configure advanced settings on individual interfaces, and configure logging and ICMP options.   
How Windows Firewall Works 
Windows Firewall is a stateful, host-based firewall for incoming traffic. Windows Firewall performs a 
different purpose from that of a router-based firewall, which is deployed at a boundary between a 
private network and the Internet. A router-based firewall protects traffic that is sent to the router as an 
intermediate stop between the traffic’s source and its destination. Windows Firewall, on the other hand, 
acts as a firewall for traffic that is destined for the same computer on which Windows Firewall is 
running.  
Windows Firewall operates according to the following process: 
Windows Firewall inspects each incoming packet and compares it to a list of allowed traffic. If the 
packet matches an entry in the list, Windows Firewall passes the packet to the TCP/IP protocol for 
further processing. If the packet does not match an entry in the list, Windows Firewall silently discards 
the packet and, if logging is enabled, creates an entry in the Windows Firewall logging file. 
You specify traffic in the exceptions list using IP addresses, TCP ports, and UDP ports. For Windows 
Firewall in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, you cannot specify traffic based on the IP Protocol 
field in the IP header. 
The list of allowed traffic is populated in two ways: 
When the connection on which Windows Firewall is enabled sends a packet, Windows Firewall creates 
an entry in the list so that any response to the traffic will be allowed. The response traffic is incoming 
solicited traffic. 
For example, if a host sends a Domain Name System (DNS) Name Query Request message to a 
DNS server, Windows Firewall adds an entry so that, when the DNS server sends a DNS Name 
Query Response message, it can be passed to the TCP/IP protocol for further processing. This 
behavior makes the Windows Firewall a stateful firewall because it maintains state information 
about the traffic initiated by the local computer so that the corresponding incoming response traffic 
will be allowed. 
When you configure Windows Firewall to allow exceptions, the excepted traffic is added to the list. This 
capability allows a computer using Windows Firewall to accept unsolicited incoming traffic when acting 
as a server, a listener, or a peer.  
For example, if your computer is acting as a Web server, you must configure Windows Firewall to 
allow Web traffic so that the local computer can respond to requests from Web clients. You can 
configure exceptions based on programs or on TCP or UDP ports. For program-based exceptions, 
Windows Firewall automatically adds ports to the exceptions list when requested by the program 
and when it is running and removes them when requested by the program or when the program

stops running. For port-based exceptions, the ports are opened whether the application or service 
using them is running or not. 
Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) 
ICF, a stateful host firewall for IPv4 traffic, is provided in Windows XP with no service packs installed, 
Windows XP with SP1, and Windows Server 2003 with no service packs installed. You should enable 
ICF on the Internet connection of any computer that is running one of these operating systems and 
connected directly to the Internet.  
When ICF has been enabled on a network connection, the network connection icon in Network 
Connections appears with a lock and a status of Enabled, Firewalled. Figure 13-13 shows an example 
in which ICF is enabled on a network connection named Internet. 
Figure 13-13  Example of a connection in Network Connections on which ICF has been enabled 
You can manually enable ICF from the Network Connections folder by doing the following: 
1. Click Start, click Control Panel, click Network and Internet Connections, and then click Network 
Connections.  
2. Right-click the network connection that is connected to the Internet, and then click Properties.  
3. On the Advanced tab, select the Protect My Computer And Network By Limiting Or Preventing 
Access To This Computer From The Internet check box. 
4. Click OK to save changes to your connection. 
You can perform advanced configuration of ICF by clicking Settings on the Advanced tab in the 
properties dialog box of a network connection. Figure 13-14 shows the Advanced Settings dialog box 
for ICF. 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 388 
Figure 13-14  The Advanced Settings dialog box for configuring ICF 
The Advanced Settings dialog box has the following tabs: 
The Services tab, from which you can configure service definitions to allow excepted traffic. 
The Security Logging tab, from which you can configure options for the firewall log file. By default, the 
firewall log file is named Pfirewall.log and stored in your main Windows folder. 
The ICMP tab, from which you can specify the types of incoming ICMP messages that ICF allows. 
ICMP messages are used for diagnostics, reporting error conditions, and configuration. By default, no 
ICMP messages are allowed.  
TCP/IP Filtering 
TCP/IP for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP supports TCP/IP filtering, which you can use to 
specify exactly which types of incoming IP traffic destined for a computer are processed for each IP 
interface. Incoming IP traffic destined for a computer, also known as local host or locally destined traffic, 
includes all packets sent to a unicast address assigned to the interface, any of the different kinds of IP 
broadcast addresses, and IP multicast addresses to which the host is listening. This feature isolates the 
traffic that Internet and intranet servers process in the absence of other TCP/IP filtering provided by 
Routing and Remote Access or other TCP/IP applications or services. TCP/IP filtering is disabled by 
default. 
You can use a single check box to enable or disable TCP/IP filtering for all adapters. This approach can 
help troubleshoot connectivity problems that might be related to filtering. Filters that are too restrictive 
might not allow expected kinds of connectivity. For example, if you specify a list of UDP ports and do 
not include UDP port 520, your computer will not receive Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
announcements. This limitation can impair the computer's ability to be a RIP router or a silent RIP host 
when using the RIP Listener service. 
A packet is accepted for processing if it meets any of the following criteria: 
The destination TCP port matches the list of TCP ports. By default, traffic to all TCP ports are permitted.  
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 389 
The destination UDP port matches the list of UDP ports. By default, traffic to all UDP ports are 
permitted.  
The IP protocol matches the list of IP protocols. By default, all IP protocols are permitted.  
The packet is an ICMP packet.  
You cannot filter ICMP traffic with TCP/IP filtering. If you need ICMP filtering, you must configure IP 
packet filters through Routing and Remote Access.  
To configure TCP/IP filtering on a network connection, do the following: 
1. Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Network Connections. 
2. Right-click the network connection you want to configure, and then click Properties.  
3. On the General tab (for a local area connection) or the Networking tab (for all other connections), 
click Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), and then click Properties.  
4. Click Advanced.  
5. Click Options, click TCP/IP Filtering, and then click Properties.  
6. Do one of the following:  
To enable TCP/IP filtering for all adapters, select the Enable TCP/IP filtering (all adapters) check 
box.  
To disable TCP/IP filtering for all adapters, clear the Enable TCP/IP filtering (all adapters) check 
box. 
7. Based on your requirements for TCP/IP filtering, configure TCP ports, UDP ports, or IP protocols for 
the allowed traffic.  
Figure 13-15 shows the TCP/IP Filtering dialog box.

Packet Filtering with Routing and Remote Access 
Using Routing and Remote Access, you can filter IP-based traffic in two ways: 
Basic Firewall 
Chapter 13 – Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 390 
Basic Firewall, which you enable through the NAT/Basic Firewall routing protocol component, is a 
stateful firewall that, like ICF, automatically discards unsolicited incoming IPv4 packets. Basic 
Firewall is only supported in Windows Server 2003 with no service packs installed. 
IP packet filters 
By using IP packet filters, you can specify the exact set of IPv4 packets that are either allowed or 
discarded. Packet filters affect both incoming and outgoing packets on a per-interface basis. 
Basic Firewall 
You can use Basic Firewall to help protect your network from unsolicited public network traffic, such as 
traffic sent from the Internet. You can enable Basic Firewall for any public interface, including one that 
also provides network address translation for your network. 
To enable Basic Firewall on a public interface, do the following: 
1. In the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, open the name of your server, then 
click IP Routing, and then click NAT/Basic Firewall. 
2. In the details pane, right-click the interface you want to configure, and then click Properties.  
3. On the NAT/Basic Firewall tab, do one of the following:  
Click Public interface connected to the Internet, and select the Enable a basic firewall on this 
interface check box.  
Click Basic firewall only. 
Figure 13-16 shows the Network Address Translation Properties dialog box.

The Basic Firewall was replaced with Windows Firewall in Windows Server 2003 SP1 and later.

IP Packet Filtering 
By using IP packet filtering in Routing and Remote Access, you can precisely define what IPv4 traffic is 
received and sent. To use IP packet filtering, you must create a series of definitions called filters, which 
define for the router what types of traffic to allow or discard on each interface. You can set filters for 
incoming and outgoing traffic. 
Input filters define what incoming traffic on that interface the router is allowed to forward or process.  
Output filters define what traffic the router is allowed to forward or send from that interface.  
Because you can configure both input and output filters for each interface, you can also create 
contradictory filters. For example, the input filter on one interface might allow the incoming traffic, but 
the output filter on the other interface does not allow the same traffic to be sent. The end result is that 
the traffic is not passed across the router running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003. 
You can also implement packet filtering to filter incoming and outgoing traffic to a specific subset of 
traffic on a computer that is running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 but that is not 
configured as a router. 
You should implement packet filters carefully to prevent the filters from being too restrictive, which 
would impair the functionality of other protocols that might be operating on the computer. For example, 
if a computer running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003 is also running Internet 
Information Services (IIS) as a Web server and packet filters are defined so that only Web-based traffic 
is allowed, you cannot use the ping command (which uses ICMP Echo and Echo Reply messages) to 
perform basic IP troubleshooting. If the Web server is a silent RIP host, the filters prevent the silent RIP 
process from receiving the RIP announcements. 
To configure IPv4 packet filters on an interface, do the following: 
1. In the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, open the name of your server, open 
IPv4 or IP Routing, and then click General. 
2. In the details pane, right-click the interface on which you want to add a filter, and then click 
Properties.  
3. On the General tab, click Inbound Filters to configure filters for incoming IPv4 traffic to the interface 
or Outbound Filters to configure filters for outgoing IPv4 traffic from the interface.
