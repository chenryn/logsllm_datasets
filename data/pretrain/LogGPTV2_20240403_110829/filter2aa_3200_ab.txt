Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
The State of Alabama has deployed nine Rapid Response Communications 
vehicles (one to each region) that can provide voice, data and video 
communications capability at the scene of an emergency. One of these units 
was recently deployed to a train derailment in the Birmingham area and 
another was utilized to provide communications when a state park was 
designed as a relocation site for Hurricane Katrina evacuees.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
• Alaska Land Mobile Radio (ALMR) is a State-wide initiative 
and certainly supports regional collaboration through trunking, to 
include collaboration with state, local and federal partners.  
• Interoperable Communication Protocols, processes and 
procedures have been already established for ALMR. 
• They are compliant with NIMS. Any radio connected into the ALMR system can 
communicate to any other radio on the system, from Juneau to Anchorage, Seward, to 
Fairbanks, to Valdez where the Trans Alaska Pipeline ends at the Marine Terminal.  
• This initiative would extend that reach to the north shore of Alaska where the oil starts its 
journey to Valdez along 
the 800 mile pipeline. 
This initiative would also 
extend the ALMR reach 
to the Canadian Boarder 
on the Alaska Highway. 
• 90-100% of the states IC 
funding has been or will 
be utilized to expand, 
enhance, maintain, train 
and exercise the State-
wide ALMR system

Communication systems acquisition and upgrades to their EOC.  Currently 
they are in Phase I (planning) of a Phase III project to have island wide 
communication abilities. 
American Samoa (AS) has signed a contract with Motorola (Honolulu, Hawaii) to install a state 
of the art communications system that will link the islands of Pago Pago, Manua, and Swains.  
This new technology will catapult the American Samoa responder community into the 21st 
Century.  Currently, AS is in phase 1 of a three phase process.  The acquisition of ACU 3000 
system and mobile/portable radios has been accomplished – linking for the first time, multiple 
users.  The second phase is installing a network of towers to improve capabilities throughout the 
island.  Phase III will conclude 
with satellite system links that 
ensure reliable networking in the 
event of Typhoons and power 
loss (an ongoing occurrence 
throughout the South Pacific).  
The anticipated timeline to 
completion is tentatively set for 
December, 2007.

Objective: Foster and support regional collaboration, improve and enhance 
interoperability                
Note: All the identified steps associated with this objective have been rated as 
approx 90% completed as of this date. Arizona has provided the following to 
support this completion status (Based on a monitoring visit in 2005): 
1. Arizona has established a Regional approach for Homeland Security. Five regions were 
established by the Office of Homeland Security.  
2. All five have a Regional strategy that compliments the overall State of Arizona 
Homeland Security Strategy.  
3. All Regions have incorporated elements of Interstate mutual aid and when appropriate 
have added an International component to it. This is evident with Arizona Counter 
Terrorism Information Center (ACTIC) liaisons, CANAMEX commission, and several 
State, Tribal, Local and 
international mutual aid 
agreements in place  
4. All regions have 
developed regional 
capabilities to address 
threat and vulnerabilities 
associated with their 
specific areas.  Regions
