Question: "A developer is designing a security-sensitive application that handles encryption keys and must ensure these keys are not written to swap files. Which of the following actions should the developer take to mitigate the risk of sensitive data exposure due to swapping, and what are the considerations that must be taken into account for selecting the appropriate mitigation?"
 "A": "Use the VirtualLock() function on Windows and check the return value to confirm the lock's success; be aware of its limitations on legacy Windows versions."
 "B": "Apply the mlock() call on POSIX systems and ignore return values since mlock() guarantees that pages will stay resident in memory."
 "C": "Opt for proprietary, third-party locking mechanisms that provide cross-platform consistency and do not require supervisor privileges."
 "D": "Employ mlock() on Linux systems for sensitive data, ensuring to check the return values; understand that this behavior might not be portable."
