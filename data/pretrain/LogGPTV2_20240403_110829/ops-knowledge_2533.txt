User: Situation:
A and B are remote hosts.
Local machine can SSH into A, but not B.
B ONLY accepts SSH connections from A.
Question:
Is it possible to use fabric on the local machine to execute commands on Host B, preferably without having to install fabric on A?
Assistant: I'm just going to answer the SSH part: Yes, you can set up a double tunnel -- one SSH from local to A that tunnels from a secondary local port (like 2121) to port 21 on B, and then you can SSH to localhost:2121 and login on B. I've done stuff like that with PuTTY.
Implementing that in fabric is left as an exercise.
