ads that blend into the other content, albeit with an inconspicuous
“Sponsored content” or similar label. Further, the headline shown
in a political article ad did not always align with the actual content
on the clickthrough page. For example, the ad shown in Fig. 13a
links (via a Zergnet aggregation page) to an article3 that recounts
Vanessa Trump’s life before marrying Donald Trump Jr., instead
of after, as the title suggests. Many Zergnet ads with headlines
implying controversy were unsubstantiated by the linked article.
Ads Mentioning Top Politicians. Overall, Trump and Biden were
referenced in ads much more often than Pence and Harris (Fig. 12).
Within political news and media ads, “Trump” is referenced in ads
2.5x more than “Biden” (11,956 ads vs. 4,691, or 40.7% vs. 16.0%),
even even after the election. Eight of the top ten ads mentioning
Trump actually involve his family: e.g., “Trump’s Bizarre Comment
About Son Barron is Turning Heads” (1,377 ads, 4.7%), or “Eric
Trump Deletes Tweet After Savage Reminder About His Father”
(415 ads, 1.4%). The top 10 ads mentioning Biden imply scandals
with his wife, e.g., Fig. 13b (1,267 ads, 4.3%), and his health, e.g., “Ex-
White House Physician Makes Bold Claim About Biden’s Health”
(423 ads, 1.4%).
Looking at the VP candidates, Pence is referenced in ads fre-
quently during the run up to the election and immediately follow-
ing the insurrection at the Capital, while a spike in the mentions of
Harris occurs in late November and early December. Some of the
top 10 ads mentioning Pence connect him to high-profile events, in-
cluding the VP debate (“The Pence Quote from the VP Debate That
Has People Talking,” 143 ads, 0.5%) and the U.S. Capitol storming
(Fig. 13c). Some of the top 10 ads mentioning Harris highlight her
ex (“Why Kamala Harris’ Ex Doesn’t Think She Should Be Biden’s
VP,” 246 ads, 0.8%) as well as her gender (“Women’s Groups Are
Already Reacting Strongly to Kamala,” 51 ads, 0.2%).
Frequent Re-Appearances of Sponsored Content. Out of 25,103
political article ads, we counted only 2,313 unique ads, meaning
that many political article ads were shown to our crawler multiple
times. On average, a single (unique) political article ad appeared
to our crawlers 9.9 times, compared to 9.3 times for campaign
ads and 5.1 times for product ads. The frequent re-appearance of
political article ads is likely an artifact of content farms’ practice of
3https://www.thelist.com/161249/the-stunning-transformation-of-vanessa-trump/
producing high quantities of low-quality articles solely for revenue
from clicks [12]. 79.4% of all political news articles were run by
Zergnet, which accounted for 19,690 ads and only 1,388 unique
ads. Other top ad platforms for political news articles were Taboola
(10.0%), Revcontent (5.7%), and Content.ad (1.8%).
4.8.2 Political Outlets, Programs, Events, and Related Media. A
small portion of political ads, just 4,306 (7%), advertised a polit-
ical news outlet, event, or other media content. This includes ads
run by well-known news organizations, e.g., Fox News, The Wall
Street Journal, The Washington Post, that advertised their orga-
nizations at large, as well as highlighting specific events, such as
CBS’s coverage of the “Assault on the Capitol” (Appendix E), or
special programs about the presidential election. Ads were also run
by less-well known news organizations advertising themselves or
their events, e.g., The Daily Caller, a right-wing news and opinion
site, or advocacy groups and nonprofits, e.g., Faith and Freedom
Coalition (Appendix E), a conservative 501(c)(4). We also observed
ads about books, podcasts, movies, and more.
4.8.3 Where did political news and media ads appear? Political
news and media ads appeared more often on right-of-center sites,
compared to center and left-of-center sites (Fig. 14). Two-sample
Pearson Chi-Squared tests indicate a statistically significant as-
sociation between the political bias of the site and the number
of political news and media ads, both for mainstream news sites
(𝜒2(10, 𝑁 = 1, 150, 676) = 16729.34, 𝑝 < .0001) and misinforma-
tion sites (𝜒2(8, 𝑁 = 206, 559) = 3985.43, 𝑝 < .0001). Pairwise
comparisons using Pearson Chi-squared tests, corrected with the
Holm-Bonferroni method, indicate that all pairs of website biases
were significantly different (𝑝 < .0001). Nearly 5% of ads on both
Right and Lean-Right sites are sponsored content, but only 3.9%,
2.2%, and 0.8% on Left, Lean Left, and Center sites.
5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Concerns About Problematic Political Ads
Our investigation adds to a growing body of work studying poten-
tially problematic content in online ads, political and otherwise
(see Sec. 2). Here, we discuss further the potential harms from the
problematic political ads we found.
Manipulative Polls. The most common manipulative pattern we
observed in our political ads was the poll-style ad. We view these ads
as problematic for two reasons. First, they manipulate people into
Polls, Clickbait, and Commemorative $2 Bills:
Problematic Political Advertising on News and Media Websites Around the 2020 U.S. Elections
IMC ’21, November 2–4, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
we raise two concerns: first, the continued polarization of U.S. po-
litical discourse, reinforced by online ads; second, the risk that
more vulnerable people are targeted with more manipulative and
exploitative political ads.
5.2 Recommendations and Future Work

clicking on ads by appealing to political motivations with (seem-
ingly) clickable user interface elements. Second, once users click,
they often ask users to provide personal information for further ma-
nipulation, e.g., to put them on manipulative email newsletters [52].
Political Clickbait. We observed attention-grabbing news and
media ads that were not official political ads and thus do not ap-
pear in political ad transparency libraries. However, these ads are
misleading: they are often designed to looks like real news arti-
cles, but the political controversies they imply (e.g., “Viral Video
Exposes Something Fishy in Biden’s Speeches,” Figs. 13a-13c) are
not usually substantiated by the underlying articles. Though we
believe these ads’ goal is to entice clicks for ad revenue, we worry
that the provocative political “headlines” contribute to a climate
of hyper-partisan political communication and muddy the infor-
mation ecosystem to which voters are exposed. We argue that this
type of political-adjacent advertising requires additional scrutiny
from ad platforms and the public.
Exploitative Product Ads. Most ads aiming to make money through
the sales of products and services are legitimate, identifiable as ads,
and meet expectations of appropriateness [97]. However, we iden-
tified product ads that we would consider exploitative, e.g., that
promise “free” products that turn out to not to be. Though such
ads are not unique to political contexts, we observed many that
leverage political controversy to attract potential buyers.
Misleading Political Organizations. Online ads (particularly na-
tive ads) have been criticized for being potentially hard to identify
as ads, and thus regulated to require disclosure [11, 24]. We observe
that these issues are compounded in a political context, where the
advertiser’s identity — e.g., political leaning, official (or not) political
organization — is (or should be) key to a user’s assessment of the ad.
Being mistaken for a legitimate, official political organization can
benefit problematic advertisers (e.g., exploitative product sellers or
the fraudulent “Keep America Great Committee” [50]).
Partisan Ad Targeting. We observed more political ads, and more
of the problematic ads that we discussed above, on more partisan
websites, particularly right-leaning sites, as well as on low-quality
and misinformation sites. Ad targeting in itself is not problematic,
and naturally, political advertisers would wish to reach people with
partisan alignments most likely to click on a given ad. However,
Recommendations for Ad Platforms and Policymakers. Political
ads are already strongly regulated due to its sensitivity. We argue
that ad platforms (which make and enforce ad policies) and poli-
cymakers (e.g., the FTC or FEC) should also consider the potential
harms from ads not currently violating of existing policies. Many of
the problematic ads that we saw were not official political ads but
leveraged political themes and could have political ramifications
(e.g., spreading misinformation via clickbait headlines). Ad plat-
forms and regulators should consider these ads alongside official
political ads in transparency and regulation efforts.
It is worth noting that there were types of problematic political
ads that we did not observe. In a preliminary qualitative analysis,
we did not find ads providing false voter information, e.g., incor-
rect election dates, polling places, or voting methods. While that
does not mean they did not exist, it nevertheless suggests that ad
platforms are regulating the most egregiously harmful ads.
The extreme decentralization of the online ad ecosystem poses
additional challenges for ad moderation. Though Google period-
ically banned political ads during our data collection, we contin-
ued to see political ads, including problematic political ads, placed
by other ad platforms. Thus, we call for more comprehensive ad
moderation standards (and perhaps regulation) across advertising
platforms — while recognizing the complex financial and political in-
centives that may hamper the clear-cut adoption of regulation [34].
Future Research. Future research should continue to audit ad
content and targeting. While our study has focused on web ads
appearing on news and media websites, the online ad ecosystem is
large and requires analysis with different data collection and anal-
ysis methods. Future work should (continue to) consider political
and other ads across various platforms — social media, mobile web
and apps — and sites. Moreover, we focused on U.S. political ads,
but future research should also critically study the role of online
ads in non-U.S. political contexts or around other historical events.
Future work should also directly study people who view these
ads, to better understand the actual impact of potentially problem-
atic ads and for different user populations.
To enable other researchers to further analyze our collected
ads, our dataset and codebook are available at: https://badads.cs.
washington.edu/political.html.
6 CONCLUSION
We collected ads from 745 news and media sites around the time
of the 2020 U.S. elections, including 55,943 political ads, which we
analyzed using quantitative and qualitative methods. We identified
the use of manipulative techniques and misleading content in both
official and non-official political-themed ads, and we highlight the
need for greater scrutiny by ad platforms and regulators, as well as
further external study and auditing of the online ad ecosystem.
