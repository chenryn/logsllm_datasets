  * I have searched the issue tracker for a feature request that matches the one I want to file, without success.
### Problem Description
If I am not mistaken, the `cookie`, `localStorage`, `indexedDB` and resource
cache of the programs based on Electron store in the following locations
currently:
  * Windows: `C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\`
  * Linux: `/home//.config/`
  * OS X: `/Users//Library/Application Support/`
But when we use software in portable devices on different computers, we
probably want to be able to freely specify the storage location to the
portable device self, to **use it anywhere continuously** , or do not leave
persistent traces in the temporary computer (maybe through in-memory session
it's possible, but `loadExtension` is not supported in this case).
In addition, we may also have multiple programs based on Electron
**developing** (or just using). Even if we are careful to avoid duplication of
names, we will encounter problems when different versions of the same software
coexist.
### Proposed Solution
    session.setPath(``);
### Alternatives Considered
    session.fromPartition('persist:name', {
        path: ``,
    });
    session.fromPartition('persist:', {
        path: true,
    });
