Question: An Android application developer is designing a security-sensitive application that requires cryptographic key storage. The developer is considering the use of Tag::BLOB_USAGE_REQUIREMENTS for key generation to ensure the key can be used without file system support, which is critical for devices with encrypted disks. Assess the implications of setting the Tag::BLOB_USAGE_REQUIREMENTS with the value KeyBlobUsageRequirements::STANDALONE for the application's cryptographic key storage design.
"A": "It allows the key to be used even when the file system is not available, such as during early device boot processes.",
"B": "It enforces that the key can only be used when the device is connected to a network to ensure higher security.",
"C": "It ensures that the key can only be used within the Android system and not by the bootloader.",
"D": "It requires the key to be stored in a dedicated hardware module separate from the device's main processor."
Answer: A
