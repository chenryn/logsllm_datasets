ABSTRACT
The popularity of sensor networks and their many uses in
critical domains such as military and healthcare make them more
vulnerable to malicious attacks. In such contexts, trustworthiness
of sensor data and their provenance is critical for decision-making.
In this demonstration, we present an efﬁcient and secure approach
for transmitting provenance information about sensor data. Our
provenance approach uses light-weight in-packet Bloom ﬁlters that
are encoded as sensor data travels through intermediate sensor
nodes, and are decoded and veriﬁed at the base station. Our
provenance technique is also able to defend against malicious
attacks such as packet dropping and allows one to detect the
responsible node for packet drops. As such it makes possible
to modify the transmission route to avoid nodes that could be
compromised or malfunctioning. Our technique is designed to
create a trustworthy environment for sensor nodes where only
trusted data is processed.

INTRODUCTION
The goal of this work is to demonstrate a secure and light-weight
provenance scheme for wireless sensor networks that can guarantee
secure and efﬁcient data transmission.
Motivations. Sensor networks support the real-time collection and
transmission of large amounts of data from many different sources.
this data is transferred
Once acquired by the source sensors,
through intermediate nodes on their way to the base station.
In
many application domains, such data is used for real-time decision
making and other critical actions and thus the data must be trusted.
Data provenance represents an important factor that can used,
together with other factors, to assess whether data can be trusted
as it conveys information about data origin, ownership, and usage.
The importance of data provenance is highlighted by Lim et al. [6]
in their approach for assessing of data trustworthiness in sensor
networks, and by showing how untrusted data could lead to severe
failures. Even though several researchers [3, 4] have applied data
provenance in many applications such as databases and workﬂows,

it is more challenging to build data provenance in sensor networks
due to their limited power budget and processing capabilities, as
well as their dynamic topology [1]. We thus propose a light-weight
provenance encoding and decoding scheme for sensor data based
on Bloom ﬁlters to trace the source and the path of every individual
data packet. Our experimental results show that our scheme is
efﬁcient, light-weight and scalable.
Related Work. Conventional provenance security solutions use
cryptography and digital signatures [5] that require encryption,
checksum, and incremental chained signature mechanisms. Syalim
et al. [9] also uses digital signatures for a DAG model of
provenance. Such solutions cannot be applied on sensor networks
due to their speciﬁc constrained resources.
Vijaykumar et
al. [10] propose a near real-time provenance for application
speciﬁc systems that trace the source of data streams after the
process has completed. However,
the real time operations in
sensor networks require immediate responses before processing the
data to prevent malicious activities that could cause catastrophic
failures [11]. Other approaches capture provenance of network
packets in the form of per packet tags [7] that store the history of all
nodes. However, such approaches have high memory requirements
especially in large scale sensor networks. Chong at al. [2] proposes
a scheme that embeds the provenance of a data source within a
dataset. However, such approach is not intended as a security
mechanism and does not deal with malicious attacks. Our approach
has been designed to speciﬁcally protect from malicious attacks
while at the same time assuring good performance.
Contributions. In this demonstration, we show how provenance of
sensor data is encoded as it travels from the source node towards
the base station at every intermediate node. With a low power
consumption and light-weight processing, the provenance of every
packet is encoded using Bloom ﬁlters, which use their cumulative
property to add information of every nodes on its path. The
encoded provenance is ﬁnally decoded at the base station node that
veriﬁes its path and the trustworthiness of its data. In the case of
veriﬁcation failure, the base station performs some further analysis
to determine the cause of the failure. Our approach is able to
differentiate between normal network misbehavior and malicious
attacks, such as packet dropping. Our approach also allows one
to determine and localize the responsible node for such behavior,
so that it is possible to dynamically switch to an alternative trusted
route without affecting the overall network behavior.
Our approach requires a single channel for both data and
provenance as opposed to other approaches that require separate
transmission channels for each [8]. Moreover, it is based on ﬁxed
size Bloom ﬁlters in contrast to traditional provenance security
solutions based on cryptography and digital signatures which may
overload the limited sensor resources.

describes our data provenance mechanism.
Then Section 3
introduces the scenarios that we plan to show in order to
demonstrate the various aspects of our approach. Finally some
conclusions are outlined in Section 4.
2. BASIC PROVENANCE SCHEME
Our approach encodes the provenance within the data packet
in a distributed manner, and decodes it at the base station. Each
data packet consists of a sequence number, its own data, and an
in-Bloom ﬁlter iBF ﬁeld containing the provenance. Every sensor
node stores the location of its neighbor nodes that can connect to
directly as well as the packet sequence number of the last seen
packet for every source. This will serve to detect if any packet has
been dropped during the next round of packet transmission, and to
localize the responsible node. In what follows, we will discuss how
provenance is encoded and decoded, as well how dropped packets
are detected and the responsible nodes located.

2.1 Provenance Encoding
Figure 1 shows the encoding steps of our provenance mechanism
that are performed at every node.
Initially when a source node
generates a data packet, it creates a corresponding Bloom ﬁlter
(ibf0) initialized to all 0(cid:48)s. The node then generates a vertex
according to equation 1 below and inserts the vertex ID (VID)
in to ibf0, which then transmits the Bloom ﬁlter (BF ) as part of
the data packet. At every intermediate node, the VID is generated
dynamically based on the node ID (ni), the current packet sequence
number (seq),
the previous packet sequence number from the
same source (pSeq), and the node secret Ki. The provenance is
aggregated at every node using the cumulative nature of Bloom
ﬁlters until
it reaches the base station with the full encoded
