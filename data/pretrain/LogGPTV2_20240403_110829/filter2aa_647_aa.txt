Term
Definition
Vulnerability
> A security flaw in a software program
Exploit
> A program that takes advantage of a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access or block access to a network element, 
compute element, O/S, or application
Exploit Filter
> Written only to a specific exploit
> Filter developers often forced to basic filter design due to engine performance limitations
> Impact - Missed attacks, false positives and continued vulnerability risk
RESULT:  Acts as a Virtual Software Patch

Vulnerability Filter
A vulnerability filter will check:
 TCP session established to appropriate port (135)
BIND to the appropriate RPC interface
REQUEST the appropriate function call (opnum=4)
Navigate to the vulnerable parameter
Determine that an overlong servername has been supplied
Pros: High Precision, hard to evade
Cons: Requires powerful and fast filtering engine
© Copyright 2013 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P. The information contained herein is subject to change without notice. HP Confidential. 
7
Exploit Filter
An exploit-specific filter detects the shell code used in a 
particular exploit. High false negatives.
For example:
EB 19 5E 31 C9 81 E9 89 FF FF FF 81 36 80 BF 32 94 81 EE FC FF FF FF E2 F2 EB 05 E8 E2 FF FF FF 03 53 06 1F 74 57 
75 95 80 BF BB 92 7F 89 5A 1A CE B1 DE 7C E1 BE 32
Pros: Simple string match, easy to design and implement, 
suitable for weak engines
Cons: High false negatives, filter is blind if exploit is modified

Policy Filter
Policy filter detects all BINDs to the vulnerable interface
Will detect legitimate traffic as well as attacks
Defining this traffic as unacceptable
•Spyware, Pings from the internet, etc.
Pros: Simple string match, easy to design and implement, 
suitable for weak engines
Cons: High false positives when used to detect exploitation of a 
vulnerability

ThreatDV + Reputation Stops Attacks – Use Case:
BlackPoS malware (used in Target 
Breach)
1.
ThreatDV filter detects BlackPOS
data exfiltration attempts using 
naming convention matching in FTP
2.
Reputation provides protection 
using blacklisted IP address
3. Attack is stopped!

ThreatDV + Reputation Stops Attacks – Use Case:
ChewBacca TOR based malware example
1.
ThreatDV has Chewbacca specific malware 
filters that detects DNS queries to known 
Chewbacca CnC servers
2.
Reputation detects TOR exit nodes used in this 
attack
3.
Chewbacca traffic is detected by using a TOR 
network activity filter
4. Attack is stopped!

– Traffic matching exploits
– Good vs. bad traffic
Network Applications
– Services
– Content hosted (malware)
– Application issues/vulns
Associations
– Participation in malware
– Participation in scams
– Participation in Phishing
Device Reputation
– Device behaving well?
– Generating Exploit traffic?
– Part of Botnet?
– Hosting Malware?
– P2P Super Node?
– …
