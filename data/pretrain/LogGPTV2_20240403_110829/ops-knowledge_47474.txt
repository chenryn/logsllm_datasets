User: Please explain how HTTPS works and describe the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.
Assistant: HTTPS is an HTTP connection encrypted by the TLS/SSL protocol to protect data security and integrity. Its working principle is to encrypt the data before transmitting it, then transmit the encrypted data to the server, decrypt the encrypted data on the server side and return the result. HTTPS uses certificate verification to ensure the authenticity and legitimacy of visited websites. When a user visits a website that uses HTTPS, the browser will request a certificate from the website. If the certificate is valid, a secure connection will be established; otherwise, the user will be prompted that the certificate is not trusted. HTTPS uses public and private keys to encrypt transmitted data. The public key is a public key that can be freely disseminated on the network, and the private key is the private key for encrypting data, which is only stored on the server and will not be obtained by any external interface. Compared with HTTP, HTTPS has the following differences: 1. Higher security: HTTPS uses TLS/SSL protocol for encrypted transmission, which can protect the security and integrity of data during transmission and prevent data from being attacked and stolen by middlemen. 2. Authentication is more reliable: HTTPS uses certificate verification to ensure the authenticity and legitimacy of visited websites, so it is more reliable. 3. More stable connection: HTTPS uses a keep-alive technology that keeps the connection open between requests and responses, reducing latency and increasing website stability. 4. High performance overhead: Since HTTPS needs to encrypt and decrypt data, it consumes more computing resources and bandwidth than HTTP, resulting in high performance overhead. 5. High deployment cost: To use HTTPS, you need to purchase and install a certificate for the website, which may take a certain amount of cost and time.
