User: Our server OS is CentOS 6.8, I was trying to install google-cloud-sdk, even though I installed 

python 2.7 in /usr/local/bin

, it is still looking at old version of 

python 2.6 in /usr/bin

. I tried giving export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH to first look at /usr/local/bin than /usr/bin but still the problem persists. please suggest a way to fix.
Assistant: If you are on Windows This is a simple solution that worked for me:
open Powershell as administrator and run this to add your Python folder to your environment's PATH:
 $env:Path += ";C:\python27_x64\"
Then re-run the command that gave you the original error. It should work fine.
Alternatively you could run that original (error-causing) command within the Cloud SDK Shell. That also worked for me.
