Abstract 
The perceived lack of security in the wireless environment 
has  delayed  many  initiatives  in  providing  access  to  e-
commerce  applications  from  wireless  devices.    Many 
organizations  are  skeptical  that  the  same  kind  of  security 
protections  that  they  are  used  to  in  the  current  Internet 
(wired)  e-commerce  environment  are  also  available  for 
wireless transactions.  In this paper we will show that these 
perceptions  are  misplaced.  We  describe  the  security 
properties  and  mechanisms  available  for  Internet  (wired), 
WAP  based  and  iMode  e-commerce.  We  find  that  both 
WAP  and  iMode  provide  excellent  security  features  and 
are  geared  to  provide  other  security  provisions  over  and 
above those commonly available in a wired environment. 
1  Introduction 
There 
inherently 
less  secure 
is  a  common  perception 
that  wireless 
environments  are 
than  wired 
environments. Reports of phone  masquerading and phone 
call  tapping  in  mobile  wireless  environments  have  led 
many to believe that this is not an environment conducive 
for e-commerce [1].  While this  was certainly  true in the 
past,  the  wireless  industry  has  been  working  hard  at 
providing  security  protections  strong  enough  for  real 
mobile-device based e-commerce.  In this paper, we focus 
on  two  “flavors”  of  wireless  service,  as  provided  by  the 
WAP Forum and by NTT DoCoMo of Japan. WAP is the 
Wireless  Application  Protocol, 
“an  open,  global 
specification  that  empowers  mobile  users  with  wireless 
devices to easily access and interact with information and 
services instantly” [2]. iMode is a proprietary mobile ISP 
and portal service from NTT DoCoMo, Japan [19]. 
The  WAP  Forum  is  an  industry  association  of  over 
500  members  “that  has  developed  the  de-facto  world 
standard  for  wireless  information  and  telephony  services 
on digital mobile phones and other wireless terminals”[2]. 
The primary goal of the WAP Forum “is to bring together 
companies from all segments of the wireless industry value 
chain to ensure product interoperability and growth of the

Figure  1  shows  the  environment  that  this  paper  is 
concerned  with.    Users  for  some  time  have  been  able  to 
access  e-commerce  (web  sites)  from  traditional  wired 
browsers (Netscape, Internet Explorer, and so on).  Users 
are also able to access e-commerce sites from new wireless 
devices  such  as  PDAs  and    mobile  phones.    This  paper 
examines  the  security  services  that  are  provided  at  the 
user’s browsing device, be it a traditional wired browser or 
a  newer  wireless  device.    The  paper  also  focuses  on 
security of the data in transmission from the user’s browser 
to the e-commerce web site.  Security issues related to the 
web site (such as storage of credit cards) are outside of the 
scope of this paper. 
In  order 
to  provide  security 
for  e-commerce 
transactions  in  both  the  wired  and  wireless  world,  it  is 
necessary to provide at least the following services [3]: 
•  User authentication – Provides the system proof that 
a user is who they claim to be. 
•  Data  authentication  –  consists  of  two  sub-services: 
data  integrity  and  data  origin  authentication.    With 
data  integrity  the  receiver  of  data  can  be  convinced 
that the data was not changed in transit. Data origin 
authentication  proves 
that  data 
actually did come (originate) from the stated sender.  
•  Data  confidentiality  -  Data  confidentiality  protects 
against disclosure of any data while in transit and is 
provided by encryption of data.

right  to  execute  an  action.  This  is  the  responsibility

•  Audit  -  An  auditing  service  provides  a  history  of 
actions  that  can  be  used  to  determine  what  (if 
anything) went wrong, when it went wrong, and what 
caused  it  to  go  wrong.  Audit  services  can  also  be 
used  to  pinpoint  the  last  known  “good”  state  of 
information.   
In  addition 
is 
increasingly  common 
that  e-commerce 
transactions  provide  non-repudiation.  Non-repudiation  is 
proof that the  user did in fact initiate a transaction. Non-
repudiation is usually implemented by requiring a user to 
digitally sign a transaction. Digital signatures are unique to 
users  and  are  used  to  provide  proof  that  a  user  was 
involved in a given transaction. If the process of binding a 
user’s  name  to  the  signing  key  (to  create  a  digital 
certificate) meets certain security and legal requirements, a 
digital  signature  can  be  “strong  enough”  to  provide  non-
repudiation of the user’s actions at a later stage.

and 
Non-repudiation  is  required  for  those  transactions  that 
are  considered  to  be  “out-of-economy”  transactions,  such 
as  bill  payments  from  a  user’s  account  to  an  account 
owned by a different entity. An “in-economy” transaction, 
such  as  a  transfer  from  a  given  user’s  checking  to  their 
savings  account,  is  fairly  easy  to  unwind  (if  necessary). 
That  is,  recovering  from  a  mistaken  or  fraudulent  in-
economy transaction is easily handled.  Unwinding an out-
of-economy  transaction  is  a  much  more  difficult  process. 
Rather 
to  unwind  such 
transactions, most enterprises would choose to rely on non-
repudiation proofs as evidence that a user did in fact agree 
to a transaction (so that unwinding is not necessary).

This paper examines the security of traditional Internet 
(wired) 
new  mobile  wireless 
environments based on WAP and iMode in the context of 
their suitability for e-commerce.  In Section 2 we provide 
an overview of the networking environment for wired and 
wireless  protocols  (WAP  and  iMode).    Section  3  gives  a 
high-level  introduction  to  the  WAP  specification  and 
iMode. The security functions implemented by WAP and 
iMode are discussed in Section 4.  Sections 5 and 6 give an 
analysis  of  WAP  and  iMode  security  and  relates  this  to 
wired security.  The paper finishes with our conclusions. 
2  Networking Environments 
In  this  section  we  briefly  describe  the  networking 
environments  common  to  the  wired  and  wireless  worlds. 
We  also  describe  the  typical  protocols  and  security 
requirements seen in the traditional wired world. This will 
provide  a  basis  for  comparison  with  the  wireless  world 
capabilities later in this paper.

2.1  Traditional Wired Environment 
        Figure 2 shows the traditional wired environment 
for a “home” user accessing an e-commerce provider (also 
known as the back-end or the Enterprise) from a browser.  
The user connects to their local Internet Service Provider 
(ISP).  The connection can happen over telephone lines, a 
cable  television  network,  ….    The  ISP  provides  the  user 
access to the Internet and routes the user’s requests.   The 
networking protocol used from the user’s browser to the e-
commerce provider is TCP/IP [4].  
2.2  WAP Networking Environment 
WAP, or Wireless Application Protocol, is an industry 
initiated  world  standard  [2]  that  allows  the  presentation 
and  delivery  of  information  and  services  to  wireless 
devices such as mobile telephones or handheld computers.  
The  major  players  in  the  WAP  space  are  the  Wireless 
Service Provider (WSP) and the Enterprise. The Wireless 
Service  Provider  is  the  wireless  equivalent  of  an  Internet 
Service Provider (ISP). The role of the WSP is to provide 
access to back-end resources for wireless users. The WSP 
provides  additional  services  because  wireless  users  must 
transition from the wireless to wired environments (unlike 
an Internet environment where the user is already “on” the 
Internet).  The  WSP’s  space  contains  a  Modem  Bank, 
Remote  Access  Service  (RAS)  server,  Router,  and 
potentially a WAP Gateway. 
 Figure  3  illustrates  what  may  be  considered  the 
“traditional”  WAP  networking 
environment.  This 
environment is analog to the wired environment, where all 
“connection-type”  services  are  provided  by  the  Wireless  
Service Provider. Much of this functionality overlaps with

of  the  wireless  communication  from  the  WAP  device 
through  the  transmission  towers  to  a  Modem  Bank  and 
Remote  Access  Server  (RAS)  and  on  to  the  WAP 
Gateway. The Modem Bank receives incoming phone calls 
from  the  user’s  mobile  device,  the  RAS  server  translates 
the incoming calls from a wireless packet format to a wired 
packet format, and the Router routes these packets to the 
correct destination.

Environment 
The  WAP  Gateway  is  used  to  translate  the  WAP 
protocols  (protocols  that  have  been  optimized  for  low 
bandwidth,  low  power  consumption,  limited  screen  size, 
and  low  storage)  into  the  traditional  Internet  protocols 
(TCP/IP).  The  WAP  Gateway 
is  based  on  proxy 
technology. Typical WAP Gateways provide the following 
functionality: 
•  Provide  DNS  services,  for  example  to  resolve 
domain names used in URLs. 
•  Provide a control point for management of fraud and 
service utilization. 
•  Act as a proxy, translating the WAP protocol stack to 
the Internet protocol stack. 
Many Gateways also include a “transcoding” function 
that  will 
translate  an  HyperText  Markup  Language 
(HTML)  page  into  a  Wireless  Markup  Language  (WML) 
page that is suited to the particular device type (such as a 
Nokia 6120 or Motorola Timeport mobile phone). 
The Enterprise space contains the back-end Web and

that  provide

transactions.  
While  it  seems  “natural”  for  the  Wireless  Service 
Provider to maintain and manage the WAP Gateway, there 
are circumstances under which this is not desirable. This is 
due to the presence of an encryption “gap”, caused by the 
ending of the Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS) 
[6] session at the Gateway. The data is temporarily in clear 
text on the Gateway until it is re-encrypted under the SSL
