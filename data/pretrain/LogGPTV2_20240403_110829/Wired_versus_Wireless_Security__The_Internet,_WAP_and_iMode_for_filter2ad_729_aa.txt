## Abstract
The perceived lack of security in wireless environments has delayed the adoption of e-commerce applications on mobile devices. Many organizations are skeptical about whether the same level of security available in wired (Internet) e-commerce can be achieved in wireless transactions. This paper aims to dispel these misconceptions by comparing the security features of wired, WAP-based, and iMode e-commerce. We find that both WAP and iMode offer robust security mechanisms and, in some cases, provide enhanced security features beyond those typically found in wired environments.

## 1. Introduction
There is a common perception that wireless environments are inherently less secure than wired ones. Reports of phone masquerading and call tapping in mobile networks have fueled this belief, leading many to question the suitability of such environments for e-commerce. However, the wireless industry has made significant strides in enhancing security to support e-commerce. This paper focuses on two prominent wireless standards: the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) and NTT DoCoMo's iMode.

### 1.1. WAP and iMode
- **WAP (Wireless Application Protocol):** An open, global specification that enables mobile users to access and interact with information and services instantly.
- **iMode:** A proprietary mobile ISP and portal service from NTT DoCoMo, Japan, which initially focused on market penetration with basic, non-secure services before adding advanced security features.

### 1.2. Security Requirements for E-Commerce
To ensure secure e-commerce transactions, the following services are essential:
- **User Authentication:** Verifying the identity of the user.
- **Data Authentication:** Ensuring data integrity and origin.
- **Data Confidentiality:** Protecting data in transit through encryption.
- **Authorization:** Determining if an authenticated entity has the right to perform an action.
- **Audit:** Providing a history of actions for troubleshooting and accountability.
- **Non-Repudiation:** Proving that a user initiated a transaction, often through digital signatures.

Non-repudiation is particularly important for "out-of-economy" transactions, such as bill payments, where recovery from fraudulent activities is more challenging compared to "in-economy" transactions, like transferring funds between a user’s own accounts.

## 2. Networking Environments
This section provides an overview of the networking environments for both wired and wireless protocols, setting the stage for a comparative analysis of their security features.

### 2.1. Traditional Wired Environment
Figure 2 illustrates the typical setup for a home user accessing an e-commerce provider via a browser. The user connects to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) using various means (e.g., telephone lines, cable TV network), and the ISP routes the user’s requests over the Internet using TCP/IP.

### 2.2. WAP Networking Environment
WAP is an industry-standard protocol designed for delivering information and services to wireless devices. Key components include:
- **Wireless Service Provider (WSP):** The equivalent of an ISP in the wireless domain, providing access to back-end resources.
- **WAP Gateway:** Translates WAP protocols into traditional Internet protocols (TCP/IP) and performs additional functions like DNS resolution and fraud management.

Figure 3 shows the traditional WAP networking environment, where the WSP handles the transition from wireless to wired environments. The WAP Gateway plays a crucial role in translating and managing the data flow, including the potential for an encryption gap when WTLS sessions terminate at the gateway.

## 3. Security in WAP and iMode
Both WAP and iMode have adopted a staged approach to implementing security, with WAP being more proactive in specifying and adopting security features.

### 3.1. WAP Security
- **Client-Side Certificates:** Used for client-side authentication and non-repudiation.
- **WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security):** Provides end-to-end security, though there is a potential encryption gap at the WAP Gateway.

### 3.2. iMode Security
- **End-to-End SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):** Supports server-side authentication, with plans to implement client-side certificates in the future.

## 4. Analysis and Comparison
Sections 5 and 6 will delve into a detailed analysis of the security features of WAP and iMode, comparing them to the security measures in traditional wired environments. This comparison will highlight the strengths and potential areas for improvement in each system.

## 5. Conclusions
This paper demonstrates that the security concerns in wireless e-commerce are largely unfounded. Both WAP and iMode offer robust security mechanisms, and in some cases, they provide enhanced features not commonly available in wired environments. As the wireless industry continues to evolve, we can expect further improvements in security, making wireless e-commerce a viable and secure option.
