In contrast to other appliances, screens can easily reduce power
without much side effects by going to sleep. Major operating sys-
tems offer unprivileged API or command line calls to accomplish
that. Hard-disks can be sent to sleep as well (spin-down) but this
typically needs administrator privileges. Furthermore regular back-
ground file system activity (book-keeping) will not make the effect
lasting without putting the whole OS into sleep. Such a step with-
draws the PC from the control of the botnet and is therefore not
included.
As for printers, we did not considered office printers as they are
usually shared by multiple users. Thus, print jobs are sequentialized
and power consumption would not multiply with the number of
infections, as it is spread over time.
Internet-of-Things devices are included in our list although they
are still rare. The exception are smart thermostats [2, 39, 50] being
sold in the U.S since 2015 are increasingly[52], in total 20 million
devices since 2013 (U.S. has 126 Mio. Households [49]). Such air
conditioners [2, 7, 27]) and smart refrigerators [48] can be manipu-
lated by changing the set-point temperature. Kitchen appliances
such as smart ovens [47] and Wi-Fi-controlled water kettles [42]
can also substantially draw power.

8a). In our setup with a small office/home office (SOHO) printer, the
heat-up process started within a second when printing via USB, and
several seconds when printing over the network. The high power
usage continues for 8 seconds for the first page and 5 seconds for
all following pages. On stand-by, the printer reheats the fuser every
35 seconds, until it goes to sleep mode after several minutes.
Screens can easily be turned on and off via software as operating
systems offer power saving controls and appropriate APIs. As seen
in Figure 6, the screen first displays a goodbye message (3 seconds),
then goes into time-out mode (5 seconds) and finally to sleep.
These measurements (Table 2) give us a preliminary insight
regarding the achievable dynamics of load changing attacks per-
formed by a botnet. As expected, capacitors in the power conversion
units smear the hard edges of artificially produced power spikes.
However, even in the worst case (60 ms per slope) an attacker can
achieve modulation frequencies up to 8 Hz.
4.2 Categorization of Load-Altering Appliances
The second part of this Section looks at the question on the amount
of controllable load by PC components and commonly found IoT
devices and their usage.
The last column of Table 2 compromises data from our own
measurements, data sheets and PC power tutorials [9].
Since such an overview cannot depict the countless different
models of hardware sold and installed around a world, its purpose
is to estimate the impact of the attacks described above.
The ∆ Load column denotes the margin of controllable power
consumption, e.g., the difference between idle state and full utiliza-
tion. For example, desktop hard disks (typ. 5,400 RPM) have a lower
base power consumption than server hard disks (typ. 7,200 - 10,000
RPM), but the difference between access and non-access is small.

conventional power plants, and low rotational inertia (d-f), i.e., fed by a high share of renewables, at different levels of total

5 EVALUATION: GRID EFFECTS
We investigated the effects of a botnet’s load change on the conti-
nental synchronous grid. In particular, seek to answer in which way
and to what extent load has to be modulated by an adversary using
the botnet. Furthermore, we studied whether the grid’s state, i.e.,
total load or the mix of feeding power plants, influences the success
ofan attack. Such attacks against critical infrastructure can never
be tested on a real system, specifically for a grid like the continental
synchronous grid area providing power to more than 500 million
people. Therefore, we developed a model in Matlab/Simulink that
is based on the model of Ulbig et al. [53] and the ENTSO-E poli-
cies [55, 56]. In the remainder of this section, we describe in detail
the model, the dependencies of grid parameters, and the success of
each attack as presented in Section 3.
Attack 1: Static Load Attack. The adversary suddenly increases a
high amount of load; the raised demand leads to an imbalance of
production and consumption, thus shifting the frequency from its
nominal value to lower values. If the adversary’s amount of load is
Figure 10: Model for static load attack (primary control)
high enough, the frequency decreases rapidly without the primary
control being able to counteract in time. If the frequency goes down
to 49 Hz, load is shed due to emergency protocol, i.e., numerous
consumers become disconnected from the power grid.
For a simulation, we developed a model as depicted in Fig-
ure 10. The model contains the grid’s response to a production-
consumption imbalance with f0 = 50 Hz (nominal frequency), start
time constant TS and the network power SN . Further, it contains
two feedback loops: The first considers the the self-regulation of
load in case of frequency changes; the load typically changes 1%/Hz.
The other feedback represents primary control, containing a satura-
tion when reaching 200 mHz (at this point the full primary reserve is
activated), a proportional element with a gain of 15,000 MW/s (full
primary reserve of 3,000 MW should be activated at 200 mHz), a PT1-
element representing turbine characteristics with TN = 2 s (fast gas
turbines) and a maximum slew rate of 500 MW/s as specified by
ENTSO-E policies. With TS = 10 and SN = 150 GW , the system’s
response to the reference incident (RI) of 3,000 MW corresponds
with the design hypothesis of the policies [55] and emphasizes our
model’s accordance with the continental synchronous grid. Sec-
ondary control is not included into this model as it would not be
activated at such an early phase of imbalance.
In a first step, we investigated the impact of the power grid’s
network power SN on the amount of load that has to be modified
by the adversary. SN represents the amount of currently produced
power and differs in the course of days, weeks and seasons. Gener-
ally, it is lower during night, summer and on national holidays, as
consumers request less power than during daytime, winter and on
work days. Values for network power PN are taken from ENTSO-E
statistics of the year 2016 [41]: The highest load was 583,711 MW on
January 19th 2016, 5-6 a.m., the lowest load of 263,591 MW whereas

on May 29th 2016, 6-7 p.m, occurred the median load of 2016 was
409,823 MW.
We measure the static load attack in multiples of a ENTSO-E’s
reference incident of 3,000 MW. The impact of these attacks on grid
frequency with a start time constant of TS = 10 s is shown in Fig-
ures 9a-9c. Reaching the threshold of 49 Hz causes load shedding,
and, thus, a successful attack. At minimal network power twice the
reference incident, i.e., 6,000 MW is enough, whereas median net-
work power requires 2.5 times the reference incident, i.e., 7,500 MW,
and maximum network power 3.5 times, i.e., 10,500 MW. In conclu-
sion, it is easier to reach the threshold for load shedding at times
of an overall low power level in the network, i.e., at night, during
summer and on national holidays.
Finally, the start time constant TS is dependent on the type of
power plants supplying the grid and is historically getting lower due
to the increased use of renewables (wind turbines, PV)1. TS might
get as low as 6 s [53]. Figures 9d-9f highlight the consequences:
more renewables make the frequency shifting faster, and reaching
the threshold for load shedding becomes easier. Low start time
constants are typically encountered during times of low power gen-
eration, e.g., on national holidays with lots of wind, as renewables
sources are preferred for supply in Europe.
Attack 2: Dynamic Load Attack. Dynamic attacks promise to be
more successful than static ones, i.e., reach higher frequency shifts
while modulating the same amount of load. In our case, the adver-
sary drives all load to full power, waits until primary control is
initiated and reaches its maximum; then, the adversary withdraws
all power consumption. Since the primary control’s full activation
takes 30 seconds, the attack load is modulated as depicted in Fig-
ure 12 (Our simulation relies on the model as shown in Figure 10).
The results of an attack via modulating 1.5 times the reference
incident are shown in Figure 11: the absolute frequency shift at
1Photovoltaics and many wind-turbines are connected to the grid by solid-state invert-
ers. In consequence, they can not stabilize the grid’s frequency by means of rotational
inertia.

ondary control

the second swing after 80 seconds is typically higher than at the
first one; in addition, the frequency is becoming larger than the
nominal value of 50 Hz for a period of roughly 30 seconds, i.e.,
frequency overshoots despite an adversary that is solely able to
modulate additional load in a grid2. Again, the less network power,
e.g., during summer and nights, and the smaller the start time
constant (more renewables), the easier it is to reach the threshold
of 49 Hz for load shedding; the higher the attack load, the higher
the frequency shift.
Attack 3: Inter-Zone Attacks. This attack relies on a synchronous
grid containing multiple zones which are interconnected by trans-
mission lines. In a first step, the adversary increases the load in
one zone. Secondary control is eventually activated, and compen-
sates for this additional consumption. As soon as this happens, the
adversary reduces the load, while increasing it in the other zone,
waiting for secondary control to compensate again. Finally, this
leads to high amounts of transmission on the tie lines, which might
eventually trip them.
2In the past, wind turbines were disconnected from the grid at a frequency of 50.5 Hz.
