### Reseller and TransIP Email Discussion

The entity in question is a reseller for the .se domain. In an email exchange with a TransIP administrator, we were informed that this situation is due to the registrar for .se, KeySystems, which enabled DNSSEC at a later date. We suspect that DNSSEC is being enabled only upon domain renewal, similar to the process observed with Antagonist. These findings highlight the challenges in applying consistent DNSSEC policies for registrars who also act as resellers for some top-level domains (TLDs).

### DS Record Validation

#### 6.4 Validation of Uploaded Records

As discussed in Section 5.3, we tested whether the popular registrars supporting the domain owner as the DNS operator validate uploaded DS records. Surprisingly, only two registrars (OVH and PCExtreme) checked the correctness of the uploaded DS records. PCExtreme takes a unique approach: a domain owner can request to publish a DS record without providing a DNSKEY or DS record. Instead, PCExtreme fetches the DNSKEY records from the authoritative nameserver and generates the DS records. This method offers a trade-off between usability and security: it reduces the risk of errors but opens a window for an attacker to provide an incorrect DNSKEY record. This approach works only for publishing the first DS record. For subsequent updates, PCExtreme requests the new DNSKEY via email, similar to other registrars using email-based DS uploads.

Of the four registrars that use email to transmit DS records, only one verified the email by asking for a security code linked to the account. Two registrars did not verify the authenticity of the email and simply uploaded the DS record. One registrar even accepted an updated DS record for our test domain from a different email address than the one used for registration. We have reported these vulnerabilities to the respective registrars, hoping they will improve their internal processes to properly validate updated DNSSEC records. These examples illustrate the challenges registrars face in deploying DNSSEC correctly.

### Summary

#### 6.5 Summary

In summary, customers wishing to deploy DNSSEC face significant challenges, even with registrars known for their strong historical support for DNSSEC. Among the top 10 such registrars, most support DNSSEC by default when they are the DNS operator, but many only partially deploy DNSSEC (e.g., fail to upload DS records). Additionally, most registrars do not validate user-uploaded DS records and fail to verify emails requesting the publication of new DS records. While these registrars should be commended for their support of DNSSEC, there is room for improvement in customer support and processes to make DNSSEC deployment easier and more secure.

### Cloudflare and DNSSEC

#### 7 Third-Party DNS Operators

We examined the two most popular third-party DNS operators: DNSPod and Cloudflare, which manage 2,309,215 and 1,561,687 .com, .net, and .org domains, respectively. These third-party operators are not registrars; instead, domain owners contract with them to outsource domain management.

After setting up accounts with both services, we found that only Cloudflare supports DNSSEC. Cloudflare initially announced support for DNSSEC on November 11, 2015, but domain owners must opt-in to use it. If they do, Cloudflare generates DNSKEYs and RRSIGs and provides the domain owner with the DS record. The domain owner is then responsible for communicating the DS record to their registrar for addition to the registry, as Cloudflare does not have the authority to do so. Consequently, if the domain owner fails to convey the DS record or if their registrar does not support DNSSEC, the domain will not be properly secured.

Only 29,537 (1.9%) of domains using Cloudflare had a DNSKEY record in our latest snapshot (December 31, 2016). Interestingly, 11,626 (39.3%) of these domains did not have a DS record, suggesting they failed to upload the Cloudflare-provided DS record to their registrar.

Figure 8 illustrates the number of Cloudflare-hosted domains with DNSKEYs (bottom) and the fraction of those with DS records (top). It shows the rapid increase in the percentage of Cloudflare domains with DNSKEYs after the announcement of universal DNSSEC. However, 40% of domain owners who enabled DNSSEC at Cloudflare did not upload their DS record to their registrar. This portion has remained stagnant, with 38.7% of domains with DNSKEYs still lacking a DS record in our latest snapshot (December 31, 2016).

To address this, Cloudflare supports the CDS and CDNSKEY proposals, which would allow Cloudflare to convey the DS record directly to the registry, bypassing the need for the user to relay it to the registrar. However, adoption of these proposals has been slow, with only one registry (.cz) having deployed it and another (.ca) considering it.

### Concluding Discussion

#### 8 Concluding Discussion

DNSSEC was proposed almost two decades ago, and today, most TLD registries support it. Unfortunately, less than 1% of .com, .net, and .org second-level domains are DNSSEC-enabled, meaning very few DNS responses provide the authenticity and integrity that DNSSEC could offer. Given the powerful attacks and the critical role of DNS, the poor deployment of DNSSEC remains a significant problem.

Our goal was to understand why DNSSEC adoption remains low. We took the perspective of a customer and attempted to buy domains and deploy DNSSEC through 30 different registrars. We found that only three of the top 20 registrars support DNSSEC when they are the DNS operator, and only 11 of the 20 supported DNSSEC when the owner was the DNS operator. The processes for uploading DS records were error-prone, with very few registrars validating uploaded data, and opened the door to security attacks. Our results highlight the difficulties domain owners face in deploying DNSSEC.

### Ethical Considerations

Our measurements of the (in)security of uploading DS records raise ethical issues. We ensured our measurements met community ethical standards. We only tested uploading incorrect DS records for the test domains we bought, thus not impacting any other domains. We responsibly disclosed our findings to all registrars with potential security vulnerabilities to help them mitigate the issues.

### Recommendations

1. **Registrars** should allow all customers to enable DNSSEC and move towards a standard of DNSSEC-by-default.
2. **Registries** should support CDS and CDNSKEY proposals to remove friction in deploying DS records.
3. **Until full support for CDS and CDNSKEY**, registries should work to make the process of uploading DS records easier and more secure.
4. **TLD Registries** should offer financial incentives for registrars to deploy DNSSEC, as seen with .se, which saw a significant increase in DNSSEC deployment with modest discounts.
