their low directivity, non-uniform H field distribution and narrow
frequency band. Thus more complex antenna options have been
researched and it was found that an Antipodal Vivaldi antenna is a
suitable option with relatively high directivity, wide frequency band
and easy manufacturing process [36]. ANSYS HFSS was used for
designing and optimizing a Vivaldi Antenna. FR4 with a thickness

measure an input voltage below 3.3 V, the coupled EM signal gets
clipped during the positive phase of the sinusoidal signal, while
the negative phase of the EM signal results in an average negative
DC voltage. This resulted in a net induction of -1.3 V at 290 MHz.
Thus clipping of positive phase of EM signal results in a drop in the
DC input seen by the ADC. Similarly, the ADC can only measure a
signal above 0 V; the results shown in Fig. 4a are thus explained by
the rectification provided by the ESD protection mechanism, with
a maximum induction of 1 V DC at 290 MHz
the change in resonant frequency of the victim circuit, under the
proximity of Vivaldi antenna.
3.3.3 Power requirement estimation using loop antenna model.
The primary concern for an EM attack is the minimum power
required from the transmitter to achieve a successful attack. Since
an EM attack relies on parasitic inductance present on the victim’s
circuit, it would be complicated to arrive at an exact closed form
solution to estimate transmitted power requirements. Also, the
complexity of a digital circuit with numerous interconnections
exacerbates the problem in estimating the power requirement in
this attack scheme. Hence, we chose to model the victim circuit
as a simple loop antenna operating under near field conditions,
to get an intuitive understanding of the power requirement as
the distance between transmitting antenna and the victim circuit
increases, under near field conditions.
To reduce the complexity of the derivation the transmitting
antenna and receiving “antenna” (circuitry) were approximated as
loop antennae, with radii r1 and r2, respectively, separated by the
distance b, and with maximum coupling between the transmitter
and receiver occurring at the frequency, ωo. Ratk represents the
source resistance along with ohmic losses of the transmitting circuit,
Catk the stray capacitance of the transmitter (assumed negligible
above), and Latk the self-inductance of the transmitter. Similarly,
on the receiver side, Cemb and Lemb gives the capacitance and
self-inductance, while Remb represents the load resistance and
ohmic losses of the receiving circuit, and M represents the mutual
inductance between the transmitting and receiving antenna circuits.
In [4] an analytical solution for the power required when trans-
mitter and receiver circuits utilize resonant coupling, under near-
field conditions, is given. Although [4] uses coils as transmitter and
receiver, the analysis applies for loop antennas too. The power at
the receiver can be related to transmitted power by

where Pr and Pt represents the received and transmitted power
and mutual inductance M under the condition r2 < r1 is given by

Despite transmission of same amount of attack EM signal power,
Fig. 4b shows that the maximum induced DC voltage of amount
-150 mV at 290 MHz. Since the medium IR illumination condition
results in 1.5 V DC voltage, the coupled EM signal does not get
affected by clipping. We hypothesize that the reason for the nega-
tive DC voltage induction is due to the fact that the photocurrent
of the SFH235 sensor, a PIN photodiode, is proportional to the ex-
ponential of the width of the insulator (I) region; thus, a uniform
increase/decrease of the effective width of I, due to changes in bias-
ing resulting from the attack EMI, would produce unequal currents
[23]. In fact, given that the p-type (P) and n-type (N) semiconduc-
tor materials are doped at different densities this effect could be
exacerbated as the effective width of the I region wouldn’t change
uniformly as equal increases/decreases in the bias wouldn’t produce
equal changes in P/N widths (and hence the width of I).
3.3.2
IEMI attack with varying distance between transmitting
antenna and victim circuit. Fig. 5a shows the ADC output when
the distance between the transmitter and victim circuit was incre-
mented in 10 cm step size. While performing this set of experiments,
the authors chose to remove the side walls of the anechoic cham-
ber, to eliminate attenuation of signal traveling towards the victim
circuit, from the antenna being placed at distances greater than
10 cm. Fig. 5a shows that the resonant frequency of the transmit-
ter and victim circuit coupling stays same, while the amplitude of
the ADC voltage drops exponentially. Fig. 5a shows that higher
frequency signal tend to influence the AC coupling less as the dis-
tance increases, because the victim circuit begins to move out of
the near-field region of the transmitting antenna. It is important
to note here that the frequency at which maximum DC voltage
was being developed was not equal to the resonant frequency of
the victim circuit. The shift in the frequency may be attributed to

digital system operations. In fact, electromagnetic signals can af-
fect digital sensing, chip to chip communications, analog to digital
conversions and cause data corruption even in digital systems em-
ploying error correction schemes simply by injection of false logic
levels. Instances in which hardware based attacks would be ineffec-
tive involve systems involving encryption or user authentication.
In the following section, digital attacks on a device connected to a
general purpose input output (GPIO) pin of a microcontroller are
experimentally verified.
Prior analog attack experimentation as demonstrated in Fig. 5a
shows that a maximum voltage of 1.2 V could be developed at a
given distance and using the specified equipment. Correspondingly,
to achieve digital bit flips a sufficiently higher voltage would be
required in a digital attack. The experimental setup, measurements,
and evidence of our ability to flip digital logic bits is presented.
4.1 Experimental Setup
To inject false signals in serial communication, a system of two
connected microcontrollers [40] was selected as the victim circuit
(Fig. 6). This system was meant to mimic a slow serial system,
typically operating at a bit rate 1 Kbps. A GPIO pin from each
microcontroller was directly connected and the units shared a com-
mon ground. GPIO pin, PB1, was configured to output a logic 1
(digital high), GPIO pin, PB0, was configured to output a logic 0
(digital low). GPIO pin, PB5, was used to receive the signal trans-
mitted from PB1 and PB0, alternatively. The Vivaldi antenna, as
described in Section 3.2.2, was used in the attack. The antenna was
placed in two alignments, one alignment is seen in Fig. 6 and in the
other alignment the microcontroller assembly is rotated by 90°such
that the antenna is directly facing the microcontrollers. The micro-
controller code allowed us to determine the effect of our attack over
a given period. The microcontroller was initialized to record 10000
data samples of the digital output of PB0 or PB1 with the GPIO pin
PB5. The data was sampled at a rate of 167 kHz. The microcontroller
would store the recorded value in an array for further analysis. This
was accomplished by initializing a timer to be periodic and throw
an interrupt when it expired. In the interrupt routine the logical
value read was stored in an array. The total number of logical 1’s
and 0’s were stored in memory and then outputted via a serial
Fig. 5b illustrates the rate at which the voltage measured at the
ADC decays with an increase in distance between the transmitter
and target circuit. Also, Fig. 5b compares the theoretically calculated
output voltage, computed using equation 4, with the measured
maximum ADC input voltage. Since the transmitter and receiver
circuits are not in fact using loop antenna we selected loop antenna
diameter values which gave the closest mach with the measurement
results. In equation 4, the values of r1 and r2 were chosen as 15
cm and 1.4 cm, while the frequency ωo was set to 250 MHz, which
was approximately the frequency at which the attacker was able to
maximally affect the target (Fig. 5b). The values of source resistance
Ratk was set as 50 Ω, since the transmitting antenna had an input
impedance of 50 Ω, while the load resistance Remb was set to 250 Ω
[40]. Substituting these values into Equation 4 results in received
power show in Fig. 5b. This can be converted into peak AC voltage
at the input of ADC using
Vadc =(cid:112)2Pr Remb
(6)
Thus from the data presented in Fig. 5b, in conjunction with (6),
one can compute the required transmitted power in order to inject
a particular value of false data into the input of ADC.
