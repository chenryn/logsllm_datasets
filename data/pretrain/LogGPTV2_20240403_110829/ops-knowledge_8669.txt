User: I have a Python/Flask web application that I am deploying via Gunicorn in a docker image on Amazon ECS. Everything is going fine, and then suddenly, including the last successful request, I see this in the logs:
[2017-03-29 21:49:42 +0000] [14] [DEBUG] GET /heatmap_column/e4c53623-2758-4863-af06-91bd002e0107/ADA

[2017-03-29 21:49:43 +0000] [1] [INFO] Shutting down: Master

And the processes die off and the program exits. ECS then restarts the service, and the docker image is run again, but in the meanwhile the service is interrupted.
What would be causing my program to get a TERM signal? I can't find any references to this happening on the web. Note that this only happens in Docker on ECS, not locally.
Assistant: For me, it turned out that the worker was quitting due to one of the containers in my Docker Swarm stack was failing repeatedly, resulting in the rollback process. The gunicorn process received the signal 'term' when the rollback process began.
