User: I am trying to move a log file from a computer, where an operation is performed, to another computer, that will get the log file and process it, returning a document with the result of the analysis.
I am using Python for the job, but I am open to other options (I have to run this copy via console on OSX, due the fact that most of my work is done in shell scripting; so cannot use any  visual solution; anything that can be launched via a script would work too); any suggestion is more than welcome since I do not really have a favorite way to do this (just trying the less problematic....I do not need any security encryption since both of the computers are on my internal network, no communication with the outside is performed).
Hope that someone can point me to the right solution, thanks in advance.
Assistant: NFS mount the filesystem, then both systems can access the same files as if they were local.  Otherwise you could use sockets.
