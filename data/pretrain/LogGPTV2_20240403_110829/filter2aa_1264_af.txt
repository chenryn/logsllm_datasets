Glossary    
LDA (local delivery agent)  A mail service agent that transfers mail messages from 
incoming mail storage to the email recipient’s inbox. The LDA is responsible for 
handling local delivery of messages, and making mail accessible to the user’s email 
application.
list administrator  A mailing list administrator. List administrators can add or remove 
subscribers from mailing lists, and designate other list administrators. List 
administrators are not necessarily local machine or domain administrators.
load balancing  The process of distributing the demands by client computers for 
network services across multiple servers in order to optimize performance by fully 
utilizing the capacity of all available servers.
MAA (mail access agent)  A mail service that communicates with a user’s email 
program to download mail messages or headers to the user’s local machine.
mail exchanger  The computer that provides your mail service. Synonymous with mail 
host.
mail host  The computer that provides your mail service. Synonymous with mail 
exchanger.
mailing list  A mail service to distribute a single email message to multiple recipients. 
Mailing list subscribers do not have to be mail users on your mail server. Mailing lists 
can be administered by a list administrator. Mailing list subscribers can often add or 
remove themselves from lists.
MTA (mail transfer agent)  A mail service that sends outgoing mail, receives incoming 
mail for local recipients, and forwards incoming mail of nonlocal recipients to other 
MTAs.
MUA (mail user agent)  A mail process on a user’s local machine that works with the 
MAA to download mail messages and headers to the user’s local machine. This is most 
commonly referred to as an “email application,” or “email program.”
MX record (mail exchange record)  An entry in a DNS table that specifies which 
computer manages mail for an Internet domain. When a mail server has mail to deliver 
to an Internet domain, the mail server requests the MX record for the domain. The 
server sends the mail to the computer specified in the MX record.
name server  See DNS (Domain Name System).
open relay  A server that receives and automatically forwards mail to another server. 
Junk mail senders exploit open relay servers to avoid having their own mail servers 
blacklisted as sources of spam.

ORBS (Open Relay Behavior-modification System)  An Internet service that blacklists 
mail servers known to be or suspected of being open relays for senders of junk mail. 
ORBS servers are also known as RBL (real-time black-hole list) servers.
percent symbol (%)  The command-line prompt in the Terminal application. The 
prompt indicates that you can enter a command.
POP (Post Office Protocol)  A protocol for retrieving incoming mail. After a user 
retrieves POP mail, it is stored on the user’s computer and usually is deleted 
automatically from the mail server.
privileges  Settings that define the kind of access users have to shared items. You can 
assign four types of privileges to a share point, folder, or file:  read and write, read only, 
write only, and none (no access).
RBL (real-time black-hole list)  An Internet service that blacklists mail servers known to 
be or suspected of being open relays for senders of junk mail.
relay point  See open relay.
short name  An abbreviated name for a user. The short name is used by Mac OS X for 
home directories, authentication, and email addresses.
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)  A protocol used to send and transfer mail. Its 
ability to queue incoming messages is limited, so SMTP usually is used only to send 
mail, and POP or IMAP is used to receive mail.
spam  Unsolicited email; junk mail.
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)  An Internet protocol that allows you to send encrypted, 
authenticated information across the Internet.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  A method used along with the Internet Protocol 
(IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP 
takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, and TCP takes care of keeping 
track of the individual units of data (called packets) into which a message is divided for 
efficient routing through the Internet. 
UCE (unsolicited commercial email)  See spam.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol)  A communications method that uses the Internet 
Protocol (IP) to send a data unit (called a datagram) from one computer to another in a 
network. Network applications that have very small data units to exchange may use 
UDP rather than TCP.
UID (user ID)  A number that uniquely identifies a user. Mac OS X computers use the 
UID to keep track of a user’s directory and file ownership.

Glossary    
user name  The long name for a user, sometimes referred to as the user’s “real” name. 
See also short name.
virtual domain  Another domain which can be used in email addresses for your mail 
users. A list of all the domain names for which your mail server is responsible.
virtual user  An alternate email address (short name) for a user. Similar to an alias, but it 
involves another user account.
