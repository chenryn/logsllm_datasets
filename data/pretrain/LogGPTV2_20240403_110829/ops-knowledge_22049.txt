User: I am developing an application that will run on Linux to run fullscreen all the time (no menus or trays or anything will be visible).
The application is going to be developed in Python, not that that matters as far as the window manager, but what I am having a hard time with is choosing a window manager.
I need something with the smallest possible footprint, that will let me run a graphical Python app and have an mplayer window at the same time, at widescreen resolutions (widescreen, 16:10,16:9, etc).  Other than that, it doesn't need a lot of features, but the end footprint size is the most important thing I'll be looking at.
What window manager would you recommend?
EDIT: There won't be any interaction with the application needed.
Assistant: I realize this is an old question, but I use openbox on my system, I have created a custom config file that disables all mouse keyboard shortcuts, and removes borders etc on the applications.
In the openbox config i even created some secret shortcuts that can run fx. an xterm for debugging live on the box.
The openbox documentation was very helpful in figuring everything out, I did the config in about 30 minutes.
