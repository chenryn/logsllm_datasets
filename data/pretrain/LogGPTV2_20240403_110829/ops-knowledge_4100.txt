I am trying to add Tesseract to my system in order to install pytesseract. I am using Windows 7.

I have added the following path to my PATH environment variable:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe
```

However, when I run the following commands from the command line:
```sh
tesseract DMTX_screenshot.png out
```
or
```sh
tesseract
```
I receive the error message:
```
'tesseract' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

Here is a portion of my current PATH environment variable:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe;C:\Users\Moondra\Anaconda_related\Anaconda\geckodriver.exe;
```

Do you have any ideas about what might be going wrong? 

Thank you.

**Assistant:**

The PATH environment variable should include directories, not individual files. Therefore, you should modify your PATH to include only the directory where `tesseract.exe` is located. For example:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Tesseract-OCR
```

After making this change, you may need to restart your command prompt or any open terminal sessions for the changes to take effect. This should resolve the issue, and `tesseract` should be recognized as a command.
