User: Please explain what is load balancing? List at least three load balancing algorithms, and briefly describe their principles and application scenarios.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technique for distributing load (work) in a computer network. Its purpose is to improve performance, increase reliability and scalability by distributing the workload across multiple computing resources. The following are three common load balancing algorithms: 1. Round Robin Principle: The round robin algorithm assigns the received requests to each server in turn for processing. Each time a request is made, it is sent to the next server in a predefined order. This ensures that the load balancer can evenly distribute requests, avoiding the situation that some servers are overloaded. Application scenarios: The polling algorithm is suitable for all scenarios where the load is relatively balanced and all servers are required to be able to handle the same number of requests. Generally used for Web servers, DNS servers, etc. 2. Weighted Round Robin (Weighted Round Robin) Principle: Similar to the round robin algorithm, the weighted round robin algorithm also polls the request to each server for processing. The difference is that it is allocated according to server weight, that is, more requests are allocated to servers with high weight. Application scenarios: The weighted round-robin algorithm is suitable for scenarios where there are differences in server performance or different response speeds caused by different network conditions. Typically used for data centers in different geographic regions to direct requests during peak processing times. 3. Least Connections algorithm (Least Connections) Principle: The least connection algorithm will assign the request to the server with the least number of current connections for processing. In this way, it ensures optimal server performance for processing requests. Application scenarios: The least number of connections algorithm is suitable for application scenarios with relatively long connection times, such as streaming media, long-term connection services, SSH and other application scenarios. In high concurrency scenarios, performance and throughput can be significantly improved.
