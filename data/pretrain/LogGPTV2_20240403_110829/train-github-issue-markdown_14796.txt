Hi,
##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
include_role
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.1.0
      config file = /home/stephane/.ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
Nothing special
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Ansible running from ArchLinux, managing an OpenBSD machine, but the problem
is with any managed machine.
##### SUMMARY
When the include_role module is used within an handler, the calling role
fails, before knowing if the handler will be called.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Create the simple following role:
calling-role/tasks/main.yml
    ---
    - name: task with notify
      debug: msg="test"
calling-role/handlers/main.yml
    ---
    - name: handler
      include_role: name=called-role
called-role can be any role, with at least on task.
I run this role with this playbook:
    ---
    - hosts:
        - all
      roles:
        - calling-role
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect the playbook to run.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
The playbook doesn't run, it fails immediately.
    Using /home/stephane/.ansible.cfg as config file
    PLAYBOOK: main.yml *************************************************************
    1 plays in main.yml
    PLAY [all] *********************************************************************
    ERROR! Unexpected Exception: 'Task' object has no attribute 'listen'
    the full traceback was:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/usr/bin/ansible-playbook", line 103, in 
        exit_code = cli.run()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/cli/playbook.py", line 159, in run
        results = pbex.run()
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/executor/playbook_executor.py", line 154, in run
        result = self._tqm.run(play=play)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/executor/task_queue_manager.py", line 248, in run
        self._initialize_notified_handlers(new_play)
      File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/executor/task_queue_manager.py", line 143, in _initialize_notified_handlers
        if handler.listen:
    AttributeError: 'Task' object has no attribute 'listen'
    zsh: exit 250   ansible-playbook main.yml -vvv
The problem still exists with the devel branch (216e2c8).
Let me know if I can be of any help concerning this issue!
