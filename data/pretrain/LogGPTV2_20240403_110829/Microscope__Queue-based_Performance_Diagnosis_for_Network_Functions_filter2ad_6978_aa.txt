## Abstract
Network function virtualization (NFV) enables flexible resource sharing and cost-effective scalability by moving monolithic network appliances to software running on commodity hardware. However, this shift can lead to performance issues due to resource contention, especially in complex topologies of network functions (NFs). Traditional methods, such as maintaining resource counters at individual NFs, are insufficient because the effects of resource contention can propagate across NFs and over time. In this paper, we introduce Microscope, a performance diagnosis tool that leverages queuing information at NFs to identify root causes of performance issues, such as low throughput or high latency. Our evaluation on realistic NF chains and traffic shows that Microscope can correctly capture 89.7% of performance impairments, up to 2.5 times more than state-of-the-art tools, with minimal overhead.

## 1 Introduction
Network function virtualization (NFV) transforms hardware middleboxes into software running on commodity hardware, known as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). This transformation brings flexibility and agility to network operations, making NFV popular in both industry and research. For example, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often deploy VNFs from different vendors in chains or Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to serve various user traffic.

However, VNFs can suffer from performance variations, such as throughput fluctuations, high tail latency, and jitters, which significantly impact service-level agreements and user experiences. Diagnosing these issues is challenging due to the complexity of NF chains and the fine-grained, intermittent nature of performance problems. These issues can be caused by various factors, including misconfigurations, bugs, traffic anomalies, system interrupts, and load imbalances.

In this paper, we propose Microscope, a performance diagnosis tool that identifies causal relations in a DAG of NFs without requiring knowledge of their implementation. Microscope uses queuing information to quantify the impact of flows and NFs on packet delay, enabling operators to focus on the right flows and NFs. Our evaluation demonstrates that Microscope can correctly capture 89.7% of performance problems, up to 2.5 times more effectively than state-of-the-art tools, while maintaining low runtime overhead.

## 2 Motivation
### Challenges of NF Diagnosis
We consider a DAG of NFs provided by one or more vendors, with no access to their implementation. User traffic is directed to NFs via NICs, hardware switches, or software switches. Each NF type may run multiple instances on different cores or servers to scale with traffic growth.

The goal is to find causal relations between NFs and flows experiencing intermittent performance problems, such as low throughput and long tail latency. Traditional time-based correlation methods, which assume that abnormal behaviors in the same time window as the problem are likely to be the root cause, are not effective for NFs. This is because NFs exhibit fine time-scale behaviors (e.g., traffic bursts, CPU interruptions, context switching) that can have lasting impacts and propagate across NFs.

#### Examples
1. **Lasting Impacts of Microsecond-Level Behaviors:**
   - A bursty flow can cause performance issues for subsequent flows. For instance, in Figure 1, a bursty flow of 300 µs affects flows arriving up to 3 ms later due to the queue taking 3 ms to drain.
   
2. **Propagation Across NFs:**
   - Fine time-scale behaviors at one NF can affect another NF. For example, in Figure 2, a CPU interrupt at a NAT causes a throughput drop at a downstream VPN, even though the traffic rate remains constant.

These examples highlight the need for a more sophisticated approach to diagnose performance issues in NF chains. Microscope addresses these challenges by leveraging queuing information to perform a detailed causal analysis, thereby providing accurate and actionable insights.
