User:  Use Ansible to automate configuration management and ensure consistent configuration across all hosts.
Assistant: Ansible can be used to automate configuration management and keep all host configurations consistent. Ansible is an automation tool that manages configuration by writing playbooks and roles in YAML format. The following are the steps to achieve automatic configuration management and keep all host configurations consistent: 1. Install Ansible and configure the Ansible environment: Install Ansible on the ansible control host, and configure the list of target hosts to be managed in the Ansible configuration file. 2. Prepare the inventory host list: Write the inventory host list file to list all the hosts to be managed. Specify the IP address, username, and SSH key for each host in the manifest file. 3. Write Ansible Playbooks: Write Ansible Playbooks to define the tasks to be executed on the host. Playbook is a YAML format file that can be used to define tasks, including package installation, file copying, service management, etc. 4. Run Ansible Playbooks: Use the ansible-playbook command to execute the written Ansible Playbook. Ansible will connect to each host and perform tasks as directed in the Playbook. 5. Verify configuration: Verify successful execution and configuration as required on all hosts. Through the above steps, automatic configuration management can be realized and the configuration of all hosts can be kept consistent.
