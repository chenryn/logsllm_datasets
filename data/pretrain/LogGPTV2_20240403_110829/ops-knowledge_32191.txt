User: I occasionally have Python programs that take a long time to run, and that I want to be able to save the state of and resume later. Does anyone have a clever way of saving the state either every x seconds, or when the program is exiting?
Assistant: If you want to save everything, including the entire namespace and the line of code currently executing to be restarted at any time, there is not a standard library module to do that.
As another poster said, the pickle module can save pretty much everything into a file and then load it again, but you would have to specifically design your program around the pickle module (i.e. saving your "state" -- including variables, etc -- in a class).
