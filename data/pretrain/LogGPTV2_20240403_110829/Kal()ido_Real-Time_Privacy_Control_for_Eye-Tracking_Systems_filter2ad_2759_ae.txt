### Latency Breakdown and Performance Impact

- **Detection:** 33 ms
- **Noising:** 8 µs
- **ROI Detection:** 80 ms

**Figure 8: Scores obtained in different conditions.**

- The game score, qualitative feedback, and a 7-item Likert scale were used to evaluate the participants' experience.
- After the four randomized settings, the objective of Kaleido was revealed, and participants were provided with an adjustable knob to control the tradeoff between privacy and utility.
- Participants interacted with the control knob, and their frequency of adjustment and qualitative feedback were observed.

**Results:**

- Participants reported their subjective experience on a 7-item Likert scale, where 1 is "Strongly Agree" and 7 is "Strongly Disagree."
- Figure 8(a) shows that at least 82% of participants enjoyed the game (score of 3 or lower) across all settings.
- Figure 8(b) indicates that game scores decrease with stronger privacy guarantees, but the decrease is not significant from the no privacy (NOPV) setting to the low privacy (LPHU) setting (only 3.2%). The decrease from NOPV to high privacy (HPLU) is modest (12.0%).
- Qualitative feedback aligned with these findings, with some participants unable to distinguish between LPHU and NOPV settings, while others found the HPLU setting more challenging.
- In the final task, the control knob was introduced, and participants adjusted it according to their desired level of utility. The adjustment did not significantly affect game scores, but there was variation in the frequency of adjustments and privacy levels chosen.

### System Performance

Kaleido's real-time performance was evaluated on a commodity PC with an Intel i7-7700 CPU and Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU. The latency overheads for the main operations are:

- **Noisy Gaze Generation (Noising):** 8 µs
- **Keyframe Detection:** 33 ms
- **ROI Detection:** 80 ms (runs only when a new keyframe is detected, approximately every 2.3 seconds)

**Figure 9: Performance breakdown and trend.**

- ROI detection is the most expensive operation, but its impact is minimal due to infrequent execution.
- Keyframe detection runs at a higher frequency (2 Hz), but even at 8 Hz, the frame rate degrades only slightly to 25 Hz.
- To deploy Kaleido at scale, performance optimizations such as GPU offloading, model compression, and resource sharing can be implemented.

### Effectiveness Against Attacks

Kaleido provides formal differential privacy (DP) guarantees for the spatial information of gaze streams, which hold against any attacker, including those with full knowledge of Kaleido’s protocols. However, it does not provide formal guarantees for temporal information. Therefore, we conducted a trace-based evaluation to study the effectiveness of Kaleido against spatio-temporal attacks using the datasets in Table 1.

**Attacks Considered:**

- **Similarity and Outlier Analysis of Scanpath:**
  - **Setup:** We used image datasets (natural, web page, and human) to evaluate the distinguishability of scanpath features on static image frames.
  - **Similarity Analysis:** The adversary attempts to re-identify users by measuring the similarity between known and newly observed scanpaths using the MultiMatch metric.
  - **Outlier Identification:** The adversary identifies outlier users whose scanpath features are significantly different from the rest using DBSCAN and DTW.

**Figure 10: Similarity scores between noisy and raw scanpaths.**

- Kaleido reduces similarity scores to be close to the inter-subject threshold even at low privacy configurations. At high privacy configurations, the scores are further reduced to be close to the random scanpath baseline.

**Conclusion:**

- Kaleido effectively reduces the risk of re-identification and outlier identification, even at low privacy settings.
- Qualitative feedback suggested that while the control knob is useful, improvements such as offline calibration and reducing the need for frequent adjustments during gameplay could enhance the user experience.
