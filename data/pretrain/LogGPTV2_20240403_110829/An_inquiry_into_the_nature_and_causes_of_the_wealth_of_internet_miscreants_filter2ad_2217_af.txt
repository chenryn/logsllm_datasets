# Analysis of Underground Markets for Services and Goods

## 4.2 Services
### Ads for Services: Measurement Methodology
In addition to enabling access to various digital goods, the underground market includes a rudimentary offering of services primarily tailored to miscreants performing financial fraud. The most common service ads are offers for the services of a cashier, a miscreant who converts financial accounts to cash. Confirmers are used to assist in the verification step of Western Union money transfers. Money transfers from credit cards require a confirmation step where the individual transferring funds from the credit card answers questions to prove they are the card’s rightful owner. This service is commonly offered on a gender-specific basis. In addition to financial fraud, a small percentage of service ads offer services such as DoS attacks, sending phishing emails, and purchasing goods with other’s credit cards (a.k.a., carding).

## 4.3 Prices
Before public underground markets were established, quantifying the cost or difficulty of obtaining a compromised host, a spam relay, or an identity was highly subjective. One might estimate the cost by performing calculations that depend on opaque quantities such as an attacker’s prowess or level of qualitative skill, such as “script kiddie” or “elite hacker.” Such qualitative techniques rarely meet the requirements of organizations seeking to assess their exposure to security-related risks or researchers interested in measuring the security of a system. Given that active underground markets exist with individuals buying and selling goods and services of all types, we can monitor these markets to quantify the difficulty of acquiring a resource. In particular, underground markets establish the monetary cost to acquire an illegal good, such as a compromised host.

### Price of Compromised Hosts: Measurement Methodology
We first extract all messages that contain explicit prices (a dollar sign and at least one non-zero digit) and remove repeated messages. Next, we use the SVM classifier trained to identify sale ads for compromised hosts to filter the remaining lines for just those lines containing asking prices for compromised hosts. Finally, we randomly sample the asking prices and manually extract prices.

**Figure 15: Asking prices for compromised hosts.**

### Price of Compromised Hosts: Measurement Results
The results of our measurements are presented in Figure 15. These prices enable defenders to quantify the cost to buy sufficient resources to overcome a defense system. For example, a DDoS defense that is effective up to 1,000 hosts can be overwhelmed by $10,000 in January or as little as $2,000 in February. The cost to buy can be used to assess the strength of an adversary with resources r at time t. For example, a $10,000 adversary can purchase 1,000 compromised hosts in January. For simplicity, we assume that sufficient quantity is available to satisfy the quantity demanded, that each host is sold at the asking price, and that there is no volume discount.

In addition to measuring the cost to buy compromised hosts, the measurement techniques used in this paper can assist in measuring costs for resources used by spammers, phishers, and identity thieves. These prices can be used to establish the cost to send targeted spam emails, to purchase a bank or PayPal account, or to steal an identity. Further evaluation is necessary to validate that the cost to buy a resource provides an accurate and reliable metric to measure the risk associated with a resource when an adversary’s resources are expressed in monetary terms.

## 5. Discussion
### 5.1 Inferring Global Statistics and Trends
Measuring global statistics and trends, such as the number of compromised Internet hosts or the number of stolen identities, is a difficult task. Not only do these phenomena exhibit significant variance over time, but they are also difficult to directly measure due to insufficient coverage.

We consider the task of measuring trends in the total number of compromised hosts on the Internet. We take an economic approach to measurement, which deviates significantly from previous, primarily statistical approaches. Rather than measuring the number of packets received at a network telescope and extrapolating the aggregate number of compromised hosts based on a random-scanning assumption, we can use the laws of supply and demand and market measurements to infer global trends.

### 5.2 Efficient Countermeasures
Underground markets represent a substantial security threat. Previous approaches for disrupting underground markets have focused on standard law enforcement activities such as locating and disabling hosting infrastructure or identifying and arresting market participants. These techniques face numerous social and technological hurdles, which limit their success and result in substantial associated costs. For example, disabling the hosting infrastructure for a market may require multinational cooperation, which can be time and resource-consuming. Furthermore, nations may refuse to cooperate with foreign law enforcement agencies or may lack appropriate laws for prosecution. Even in the case where law enforcement techniques have succeeded in disrupting an underground market, the markets often re-emerge under new administration with a new “bulletproof” hosting infrastructure. Identifying and arresting key players also includes a host of associated complexities and costs, such as tracing individuals through chains of compromised hosts and the cost of subsequent legal proceedings.

The substantial costs and limited success of standard law enforcement techniques motivate our search for low-cost approaches to countering the threat posed by underground markets.

#### 5.2.1 Sybil Attack
In a Sybil attack on a voting system, an attacker creates numerous identities (Sybils) to control a disproportionately high percentage of votes. Using a similar idea, we can exploit the open nature of the underground market to establish Sybil identities, which in turn disrupt the market by undercutting its participant verification system. To demonstrate our attack concretely, we describe it in the context of the market studied in this paper. Our attack proceeds in three stages: 1) Sybil generation, 2) achieving verified status, and finally 3) deceptive sales.

**Sybil Generation:**
In stage one, an attacker establishes multiple Sybil identities by connecting to the market’s IRC servers and registering nicknames. The required number of Sybil identities depends on the number of verified-status sellers in the market. A higher ratio of Sybils to verified-status sellers will improve the overall effectiveness of the attack.

**Achieving Verified Status:**
In stage two, an attacker builds the status of each Sybil identity. This can be accomplished through positive feedback from other Sybils or out-of-band activities. The verification system of the underground market studied in this paper provides verified status to participants who freely provide high-quality credit card data. The success of a Sybil attack depends on the cost associated with generating a Sybil identity and the cost of achieving verified status. For a Sybil attack to be successful, these costs must be minimized. For the studied market, a low-cost technique to achieve verified status is to enter several separate IRC channels and replay credit card data seen in one channel to a different channel. This allows verified-status Sybils to be produced at a minimal cost.

**Deceptive Sales:**
In stage three, an attacker utilizes their verified-status Sybils to advertise goods and services for sale. Rather than undergoing an honest transaction, the attacker first requests payment and subsequently fails to provide the good or service promised. Such behavior is known as “ripping,” and it is the goal of the verification system to minimize such behavior. However, poor controls on how one achieves verified status and establishes identities make it possible to undermine the market’s verification system. If an attacker’s Sybils are indistinguishable from other verified-status sellers, a buyer will be unable to identify honest verified-status sellers from dishonest verified-status Sybils. In the long term, buyers will become unwilling to pay the high asking price requested by verified-status sellers because of the buyer’s inability to assess the true quality of sellers.

Markets that exhibit this form of asymmetric information, where buyers are unable to distinguish the quality of goods, are known as lemon markets. Lemon markets see a reduction in successful transactions until the information asymmetry is corrected. In our case, the market would need to establish a verification system that is robust against Sybil attacks. One approach would be to detect anomalous recommendation topologies, but this would require a sophisticated system for tracking interactions over time. Another approach would be to increase the cost of establishing an identity, in turn pushing the market towards a closed market, which discourages new individuals from joining—subsequently raising the barrier to entry for cybercrime.

#### 5.2.2 Slander Attack
In a slander attack, an attacker eliminates the verified status of buyers and sellers through false defamation. By eliminating the status of honest individuals, an attacker again establishes a lemon market. To understand why, consider a market with one verified-status seller, Honest Harry, one unverified seller, Dishonest Dale, and an unlimited number of buyers. If the verification system accurately classifies individuals into honest and dishonest classes, in turn minimizing the variance in expected payoff of an entity, Honest Harry will charge a premium for his goods since a buyer’s expected payoff when undertaking a transaction with Harry will be higher than their expected payoff with Dishonest Dale. Assume a number of buyers slander Harry, subsequently eliminating his verified status. As a result, buyers will lower their expected payoff for transactions with Harry under the assumption that Harry is less honest than before (exhibits a higher variance in payoffs). However, having remained honest, Harry will be unwilling to accept a lower price (since in an efficient market Harry is already selling at equilibrium). Buyers will, in turn, leave the market or undertake transactions with Dishonest Dale, who may fail to uphold his end of a transaction. Regardless, the result is a marked decrease in the number of successful transactions—a desired outcome.

## 6. Related Work
Related work falls into two categories: underground markets and the economics of information security.

Previous studies have framed the existence of underground cyber markets but have not systematically analyzed the markets. We employ machine learning techniques and random sampling to classify logs into a number of categories; allowing us to assess the extent of miscreant behavior rather than only observing snapshots in phenomenological terms.

Anderson discusses why security failures may be attributable to “perverse economic incentives” in which victims bear the costs of security failures rather than those who are responsible for the system’s security in the first place. Schechter develops an argument that the cost to break into a system is an effective metric to quantitatively assess the security of the system. Schechter also suggests that vulnerability markets could be set up to entice hackers to find exploits. The lowest expected cost for anyone to discover and exploit a vulnerability is the Cost to Break metric. Schechter also advances an econometric model of the security risk from remote attack. In comparison, this paper proposes a security metric not for a particular system with unknown vulnerabilities, but for the Internet as a whole. Similar to the cost to break metric, our proposed metric uses market pricing. Ozment reformulated Schechter’s vulnerability markets as “bug auctions” and applied auction theory to tune market structure. In a position paper, Aspnes et al. state as a key challenge that of obtaining quantitative answers to the scope of Internet insecurity. Aspnes et al. also state that “economics provides a natural framework within which to define metrics for systemic security.” The approach proposed in this paper hopes to partially fulfill this goal.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work
Internet miscreants of all sorts have banded together and established a bustling underground economy. This economy operates on public IRC servers and actively flouts the laws of nations and the rights of individuals. To elucidate the threat posed by this market, we performed the first systematic study, including extensive measurements of 7 months of data and the use of machine learning techniques to label messages with their associated meanings.

To stimulate further research, we discussed how our measurements might be applied to quantify the security of systems and to estimate global trends that are difficult to measure, such as changes in the total number of compromised hosts on the Internet. Further, we sketched efficient, low-cost countermeasures that use principles from economics to disrupt the market from within. These countermeasures deviate significantly from today’s use of law enforcement or technical approaches, which meet with substantial costs.

The ready availability of market data for illegal activities begs a number of interesting questions. For example, how does the market respond to security-related incidents such as the discovery of an exploit or the release of a patch? The use of economic event studies may enable us to better understand the true costs and benefits of deployed security technologies, data breaches, and new security protocols. In addition to studying effects, tracking underground market indices may allow for accurate forecasting and predictions of the future state of Internet security. We consider this study an initial step towards the use of economic measurements of underground markets to provide new directions and insights into the state of information and Internet security.
