User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How does CTRL-ALT-DEL to log in make Windows more secure? When logging into Windows, it says on that page that CTRL-ALT-DEL somehow makes Windows more secure.  I have never been able to figure a mechanism where having to press some specific key combination before logging in makes the system more secure.  I have never encountered a VMS, UNIX or related system that makes you press any key to log in -- except older terminal-based UNIXes where you press ENTER to get a login prompt.

How does having to press CTRL-ALT-DEL before logging in make Windows more secure?

Assistant: The Windows (NT) kernel is designed to reserve the notification of this key combination to a single process: Winlogon. So, as long as the Windows installation itself is working as it should - no third party application can respond to this key combination (if it could, it could present a fake logon window and keylog your password ;)
