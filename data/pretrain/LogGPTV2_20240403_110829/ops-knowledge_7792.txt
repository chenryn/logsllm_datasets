User: I am trying to modify the guestbook example webapp to reduce the amount of database writes.
What I am trying to achieve is to load all the guestbook entries into memcache which I have done. 
However I want to be able to directly update the memcache with new guestbook entries and then write all changes to the database as a batch put.() every 30 seconds.
Has anyone got an example of how I could achieve the above? it would really help me!
Thanks :)
Assistant: This is a recipe for lost data. I have a hard time believing that a guest book is causing enough write activity to be an issue. Also, the bookkeeping involved in this would be tricky, since memcache isn't searchable.
