The scores are aggregated to determine the final AS hegemony value. Specifically, for each selected viewpoint \( j \), the Betweenness Centrality (BC) of an AS \( v \) (denoted as \( BC_j(v) \)) is computed using only the AS paths reported by \( j \). The AS hegemony score of \( v \) is then calculated as the average BC value across all selected viewpoints.

These steps can be formally summarized in a single equation. Let \( n \) be the total number of viewpoints, and let \( \lfloor \cdot \rfloor \) denote the floor function. The AS hegemony score \( H(v) \) for an AS \( v \) is given by:

\[
H(v) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} BC_j(v)
\]

Figure 4 illustrates the dominance of Level(3) throughout the study period. Following Level(3)'s acquisition of Global Crossing (AS3549) in 2011, it achieved the highest AS hegemony score recorded for the IPv4 global graph in 2012, with \( H = 0.19 \). Additionally, from 2008 to 2010, Global Crossing was the most dominant AS in the Level(3) local graph, indicating that it was the most frequently used transit network to reach Level(3). These findings suggest that the acquisition of Global Crossing was the most effective strategy for Level(3) to acquire new customers. This also highlights the utility of our tools for deployment and business decisions.

For IPv6 (Fig. 3b), we observe a more rapid flattening of the Internet topology compared to IPv4. We hypothesize that this is primarily due to the relatively archaic state of the IPv6 topology in 2007. However, IPv6 has since matured significantly, and the AS hegemony distribution for IPv6 in 2017 closely resembles that of IPv4 in 2009. The most notable difference is the central role played by Hurricane Electric (HE) in the IPv6 topology. After doubling its number of peers in 2009 [8], HE has dominated the IPv6 space from 2009 onward, reaching an impressive AS hegemony score of \( H = 0.46 \) in 2017. This score is substantially higher than the second and third highest scores, which were 0.07 and 0.05 for Level(3) and Telia, respectively. Consequently, our tools confirm the dominant position of HE observed in previous studies [4] and provide a systematic way to quantify the overall dependency on HE in the IPv6 space.
