scores are aggregated to give the ﬁnal AS hegemony value. That is, for each
selected viewpoint j the BC of v (hereafter referred as BC(j)(v)) is computed

only from AS paths reported by j. And the average BC value across all selected
viewpoints is the AS hegemony score of v.
These steps can be formally summarized into one equation. Let n be the total
number of viewpoints, (cid:2).(cid:3) be the ﬂoor function and 0 ≤ 2α  0.05).
Figure 4 also depicts the dominance of Level(3) through the entire study
period. After Level(3) acquisition of Global Crossing (AS3549) in 2011, it reached
in 2012 the highest AS hegemony score monitored for the IPv4 global graph
(H = 0.19). We also found that from 2008 to 2010 Global Crossing was the most
dominant AS in Level(3) local graph, meaning that it was the most common
transit network to reach Level(3). These results thus assert that Global Crossing
acquisition was the most eﬀective way for Level(3) to attain new customers. It
also illustrates the beneﬁts of our tools for deployment and business decisions.
For IPv6 (Fig. 3b) we observe a faster Internet ﬂattening than for IPv4. We
hypothesize that this is mainly because the Internet topology for IPv6 in 2007
was quite archaic. But IPv6 has drastically gained in maturity, the AS hegemony
distribution for IPv6 in 2017 is then very close to the one for IPv4 in 2009. The
most striking diﬀerence with IPv4 is the central role played by Hurricane Electric
(HE) in the IPv6 topology. After doubling its number of peers in 2009 [8], HE
has been clearly dominating the IPv6 space from 2009 onward. It reaches an
impressive AS hegemony H = 0.46 in 2017, largely above the second and third
highest scores (0.07 and 0.05), respectively, for Level(3) and Telia. Consequently,
our tools conﬁrm the dominant position of HE observed previously [4] and permit
to systematically quantify the overall IPv6 dependency to HE.
