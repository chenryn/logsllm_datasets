Question: You are configuring a web server to host the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) for your domain. After creating a DNS host record for the CRL, you must set up a file share with appropriate permissions and disable caching for the shared folder. What are the correct steps to completing this configuration?
"A": "In the file share properties, share the folder with the name 'cdp$', set 'Full control' permission for the certificate authority, disable caching by selecting 'No files or programs from the shared folder are available offline', and ensure NTFS permissions grant 'Full control' to the certificate authority.",
"B": "Configure the shared folder with the name 'crl$', set 'Read' permission for everyone, enable caching by selecting 'Only the files and programs that users specify are available offline', and set NTFS permissions to 'Read & Execute' for authenticated users.",
"C": "Share the folder without setting a specific share name, grant 'Modify' permissions to the certificate authority, leave caching settings at their default values, and set NTFS permissions to 'Full control' for the web server's computer account only.",
"D": "In the file share properties, share the folder with the name 'cdp', set 'Read & Execute' permission for the certificate authority, disable caching by selecting 'Files or programs from the shared folder can be cached for offline use', and ensure NTFS permissions grant 'Modify' to the web server administrators group."
