## Abstract

This study investigates the ecosystem of commercial pay-per-install (PPI) and its role in the proliferation of unwanted software. PPI enables companies to bundle their applications with popular software for a fee, effectively commoditizing access to user devices. We developed an analysis pipeline to track the business relationships underpinning four of the largest commercial PPI networks and classify the bundled software families. Our findings indicate that unwanted ad injectors, browser settings hijackers, and "cleanup" utilities dominate the software families purchasing installs. Developers of these families pay $0.10–$1.50 per install, recouping costs through unauthorized monetization or exorbitant subscription fees. Based on Google Safe Browsing telemetry, we estimate that PPI networks drive over 60 million download attempts weekly—nearly three times the rate of malware. Despite defensive measures by anti-virus and browsers, PPI networks actively interfere with or evade detection. Our results highlight the deceptive practices of some commercial PPI operators.

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, unwanted software has become a significant threat to users. Prominent examples include ad injectors, browser settings hijackers, and user trackers. Estimates suggest that ad injection affects up to 5% of browsers, and deceptive extensions in the Chrome Web Store affect over 50 million users. The root cause of these installations remains unclear, but one potential explanation is commercial PPI, where developers bundle third-party applications during installation in exchange for payment. Unlike blackmarket PPI, commercial PPI relies on user consent dialogues to operate legally. Download portals often bundle search toolbars, anti-virus trials, and registry cleaners, leading to a poor user experience and profit for companies that commoditize software bundling. One major PPI company reported $460 million in revenue in 2014.

In this work, we explore the commercial PPI ecosystem and its role in distributing notorious unwanted software families. We identified 15 PPI affiliate networks, primarily based in Israel, Russia, and the United States. We selected four of the largest networks for a year-long investigation from January 8, 2015, to January 7, 2016, to track the software families paying for installs, their impact on users, and the deceptive distribution practices involved.

We found that commercial PPI distributes approximately 160 software families weekly, with 59% flagged as unwanted by at least one anti-virus engine on VirusTotal. The most persistent families include ad injectors like Crossrider and scareware that tricks users into paying for resolving "dangerous" registry settings. PPI networks support these families as first-class partners, using techniques to detect hostile environments and select undetected offers. Developers pay between $0.10–$1.50 per install, with prices influenced by geographic demand.

Using Google Safe Browsing telemetry, we measured the global impact of commercial PPI. On average, Safe Browsing generates over 60 million warnings related to unwanted software delivered via PPI—three times the rate of malware. Despite these protections, the Chrome Cleanup Tool indicates tens of millions of unwanted software installs. Of the top 15 installed families, 14 distribute via commercial PPI.

Thousands of PPI affiliates drive these downloads through various distribution practices, including freeware, video, and software crack sites. For other sites, PPI networks provide "promotional tools" like butter bars warning of outdated Flash players, leading to PPI bundles. Affiliates frequently change domains to avoid detection and cloak against Safe Browsing scans. Our findings illustrate the deceptive behaviors in the commercial PPI ecosystem and their significant impact on users.

**Contributions:**
- First investigation of commercial PPI's internal operations and its relation to unwanted software.
- Estimate that commercial PPI drives over 60 million download attempts weekly.
- Find that 14 of the top 15 unwanted software families distribute via commercial PPI.
- Show that commercial PPI installers and distributors knowingly attempt to evade user protections.

## 2. Commercial Pay-Per-Install

### 2.1 Definition and Structure

Commercial PPI involves software developers bundling third-party applications in return for a fee. Figure 1 shows an example where clicking "accept" installs eight offers through a single dialogue. Some of these may be unwanted software, flagged by at least one anti-virus engine on VirusTotal.

In contrast to blackmarket PPI, which illegally sells access to compromised hosts, commercial PPI relies on user consent dialogues. To simplify buying and selling installs, commercial PPI operates as an affiliate network. The structure includes advertisers, publishers, and PPI affiliate networks, as outlined in Figure 2.

- **Advertiser:** Software owners who pay third-parties to distribute their binaries or extensions. Advertisers include developers of unwanted software, such as Conduit, Wajam, or Shopperz, who recoup PPI installation fees by monetizing users through ad injection, browser settings hijacking, or user tracking.
- **Publisher:** Creators or distributors of popular software applications. Publishers use PPI networks to re-wrap their applications in downloaders that install multiple advertiser binaries. This separation allows publishers to focus on driving installs.
- **PPI Affiliate Network:** Manages business relationships, provides custom downloaders, and handles payments. The network determines which offers to install and the level of user consent.

### 2.2 Identifying PPI Networks

Commercial PPI networks are largely private companies with venture capital backing, such as InstallMonetizer and OpenCandy. Registration as a publisher is simple, leading to extensive discussions on dubious distribution techniques in underground forums. We tracked conversations on blackhatworld.com and pay-per-install.com, identifying over 50 commercial PPI affiliate programs focused on Windows installs.

### 2.3 Acquiring PPI Downloader Samples

We acquired downloaders for fifteen distinct PPI networks, listed in Table 1. These networks have been operational for 2-3 years, with the oldest dating back to 2008. Six of the fifteen were resellers for other PPI networks. We selected four large networks—Amonetize, InstallMonetizer, OpenCandy, and Outbrowse—for our investigation.

## 3. Monitoring the PPI Ecosystem

### 3.1 PPI Downloader Protocol

All four PPI downloaders use a three-stage protocol to fetch advertiser binaries:
1. **Fingerprinting:** The downloader determines the client's operating system, default browser, and unique identifiers.
2. **Verification:** The downloader checks for specific registry keys to prevent multiple installations and avoid anti-virus interference.
3. **Installation and Reporting:** If the criteria are met, the downloader displays the offer, executes the binary, and reports successful installs.

Figure 4 and Figure 5 provide examples of the request and response in this protocol.

## 4. Conclusion

Our study provides the first in-depth look at the internal operations of commercial PPI and its role in distributing unwanted software. We estimate that PPI networks drive over 60 million download attempts weekly, with 14 of the top 15 unwanted software families distributing via PPI. Our findings highlight the deceptive practices and significant impact on users, underscoring the need for improved defenses and regulatory oversight.
