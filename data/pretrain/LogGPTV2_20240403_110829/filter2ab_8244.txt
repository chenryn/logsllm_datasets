**ATT&CK ID:** M0948  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Application Isolation and Sandboxing

**Description:**
Application isolation is a security measure designed to restrict the access of an exploited application to other processes and system features. This technique helps contain potential damage by limiting the scope of what a compromised application can affect.

**Examples of Built-in Features:**
- **Windows:**
  - **Software Restriction Policies (SRP):** Allows administrators to control which software can run on a system.
  - **AppLocker:** Provides more granular control over which applications are allowed to run, based on various criteria such as file path, publisher, or file hash.

- **Linux:**
  - **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux):** A security module that provides a flexible mandatory access control mechanism.
  - **AppArmor:** A security framework that confines programs to a set of predefined policies, limiting their capabilities and access to system resources.

By implementing these features, organizations can enhance their overall security posture and reduce the risk of a single compromised application leading to a broader system compromise.
