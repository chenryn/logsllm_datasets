Subject: Issue with Git/Dropbox Integration in VS Code

Hello,

Since I installed Visual Studio Code, I've been experiencing a recurring issue with Git and Dropbox. Whenever I open a folder in VS Code that is a Git repository, the index file and the FETCH_HEAD file are constantly being updated, not just when I save a file, but every few seconds.

This behavior is causing problems with Dropbox, which I use to synchronize files between my home and work computers. The constant updates trigger frequent notifications in the bottom right corner of my screen, and Dropbox continuously uploads files, assuming they have been modified. This situation has become quite frustrating.

Has anyone else encountered this issue? 

For reference, I am using Visual Studio Code version 0.10.6.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
