Hi,
Ever since installing VS Code I seem to have a problem with Git/Dropbox.
Whenever I have a folder open in VS Code which is a git repository it seems to
constantly update the index file and the FETCH_HEAD file. I don't mean every
time I save a file, I mean every few seconds.
This causes a problem with Dropbox because I'm using it to sync files between
my home and work computers. The notifications in the bottom right of my screen
keep coming thick and fast and it's driving me crazy. Not to mention that
Dropbox is constantly uploading files because it thinks they've changed.
Anyone else having this problem?
Version of VS Code: 0.10.6
