**Recommendation:**
- **Enable Logging for Default Accounts:** Configure the default account policy to enable logging. This ensures that all activities associated with these accounts are recorded and can be reviewed for security purposes.
- **Manage Logging Policies:** Implement and manage policies to restrict the ability to modify logging settings. Only authorized users, such as system administrators, should have the necessary permissions to make changes to logging policies. This helps prevent unauthorized alterations and ensures the integrity of the log data.

By following these recommendations, you can enhance the security of your environment by maintaining comprehensive and reliable logs, which are crucial for detecting and responding to potential security incidents.
