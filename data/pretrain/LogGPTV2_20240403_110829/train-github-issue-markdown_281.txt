The demo uses a simple Quiz application (just the routing part).
Steps to reproduce -
  1. Start the quiz
  2. Navigate forward
  3. Click the back button and notice that the component does not render properly

**Current behavior**
  * usage of the browser's back button does not cause component to re-render properly
**Expected/desired behavior**
  * usage of the browser's back button _does_ cause the component to re-render properly (see Google Chrome behavior for expected behavior)
**Other information**  
I also posted a question to Stack Overflow about this for additional context
