User: Please write a piece of Python code to obtain the source code of a specified URL webpage and find a keyword in it.
Assistant: The following is a Python code example, which uses the urllib library to obtain the source code of the specified URL webpage and search for keywords in the code. ```python import urllib.request # specify the URL url = "https://www.example.com/" # get the source code of the web page response = urllib.request.urlopen(url) html = response.read() # read the web page Convert the source code to a string and look for the keyword if "keyword" in str(html): print("The keyword appears in the source code of the web page.") else: print("The keyword was not found in the source code of the web page." ) ``` Note that the keywords here need to be replaced with the actual content to be searched. In addition, when using the urllib library to obtain the source code of the web page, problems such as network exceptions may occur, and exception handling is required to avoid program crashes.
