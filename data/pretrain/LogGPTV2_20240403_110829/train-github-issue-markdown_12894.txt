I've upgraded to matplotlib 1.4.0 and am getting invalid EPS files (according
to Preview) when I save figures that use
basemap (1.0.7). The same figure in PNG or PDF format works fine. I also saved
a bar chart in EPS that worked.
I have verified that this happens in both OS X Mavericks and Mountain Lion. It
doesn't matter whether I install using pip or homebrew. If I downgrade to
matplotlib 1.3.1 it works fine.
Below is the code I was trying:
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('Agg')
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
    import numpy as np
    from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
    plt.figure()
    m = Basemap(projection='npstere',lon_0=-270.,boundinglat=30.,round=True)
    m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=1)
    m.drawmapboundary(linewidth=1)
    m.fillcontinents(color='silver')
    m.drawmeridians(np.arange(-360,1,60))
    m.drawparallels(np.arange(30,90,30))
    plt.savefig('test.eps')
    plt.savefig('test.pdf')
    plt.savefig('test.png')
