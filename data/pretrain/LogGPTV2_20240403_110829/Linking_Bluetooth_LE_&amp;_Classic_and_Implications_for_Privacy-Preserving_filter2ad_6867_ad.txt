drivers. Along with the devices, we explore whether only
speciﬁc apps and/or advertisement conﬁgurations are affected
by the vulnerability or whether it is fundamental to all BLE
advertisements. We select a set of apps to answer this question.
Our baseline app was nRF Connect that directly uses the
Bluetooth API and permits conﬁguring advertisements param-
eters such as transmit power and latency. Secondly, we choose
an app that uses the Exposure Notiﬁcation API - Immuni.
Different apps may have different implementations but their
underlying mechanism is the same. Immuni is quite mature
and was among the ﬁrst Exposure Notiﬁcation apps. It was
downloaded more than 1.5 million times from the Google Play
Store. We also explore an alternative app to Immuni called
StopCovid [37] that does not utilize the Exposure Notiﬁcation
API. Instead, it sends BLE advertisements containing identi-
ﬁers generated from the ROBERT protocol [38]. Finally, we
select Find My as a speciﬁc app for iOS devices.
We setup the aforementioned devices in three different
scenarios to understand the impact of various factors:
a) Scenario A: This is the most controlled one in our
evaluations, yet emulates real-world BTC and BLE usage. The
scenario is comprised of a residential area that exhibits low to
average amounts of trafﬁc from both BTC and BLE devices.
We place our test devices at random locations of this area.
They stream music over BTC and transmit BLE advertise-
ments using the apps under test. We found an additional 20
BLE advertisers and 2 BTC devices during our measurement.
This low noise scenario is useful because it allows us to
evaluate the performance across different devices and apps
while avoiding the randomness associated with excessive RF
interference and packet collisions.
b) Scenario B: This consists of an ofﬁce environment
with many devices operating in the 2.4 GHz spectrum, using
both Wi-Fi and BT. In addition to the trafﬁc generated in typ-
ical ofﬁces, this speciﬁc area includes two IoT labs resulting
in a crowded scenario. All devices considered, this scenario
presents more than 100 BLE devices advertising concurrently
and transmissions from 20 different BTC devices, leading to
signiﬁcant interference. We placed our test devices in random
locations of this ofﬁce with each device using similar levels
of BTC and BLE transmissions as the ﬁrst scenario.
c) Scenario C: Due to limited physical space in the
previous scenarios, we include another scenario in a football
ﬁeld about 100 meters in length. We intentionally place our
devices far away at 20m, 40m, 60m in this ﬁeld to measure
the viability of performing the attack from a distance.
As all three scenarios described are public and not isolated,
we take precautions to ensure that the information we record
does not contain any private information of individuals. To
that end, we only record timestamps, BLE random addresses
and Service UUID to identify the application being used.
VII. ATTACK EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION RESULTS
We describe the results of the attack evaluation in the
considered scenarios, exploring the impact of metrics relevant

Find My to de-anonymized BTC for different recording sizes.
for a real world attack, such as recording time, chipset, BLE
and BTC trafﬁc or apps used.
A. Impact of Recording Time
A key attack metric, especially for Exposure Notiﬁcation
Service due to its low transmit power, is the duration the
attacker needs to be in the vicinity of a victim. To understand
its impact, we consider recording intervals of 1s, 2s, 5s and
10s. This emulates the scenario where the victim just passes
by the attacker or the attacker follows the victim closely for
a short duration. We use the setup described in Scenario A,
and place 5 different devices each one connected to a BT
device. The devices were conﬁgured to stream audio over
BTC and transmit BLE advertisements. We setup the Android
devices to transmit Exposure Notiﬁcation advertisements and
iPhone to transmit Find My advertisements. We took 10s
recordings every minute for half an hour, resulting in 300s
of total RF spectrum recordings. Then, we split the recordings
based on the chosen interval and analyzed them independently.
We computed, for each chunk, if we are able to link BTC
transmissions and BLE advertisements for the target devices.
Figure 7 shows the probability of linking Exposure Notiﬁca-
tion and Find My BLE advertisements with same-device BTC
transmissions. Note that the advertising period for Find My
is 2s, hence the low linkability probability for 1s recordings.
Nonetheless, due to iPhone X transmitting at high power,
the system already achieves 95% linkability probability with
2s recordings,
increased to 100% for 10s recordings. For
exposure notiﬁcation, we see that, even for 1s recordings, our
system is able to link correctly devices advertising Exposure
Notiﬁcation 77% of the time. For 10s recordings, the system
correctly links devices almost 100% of the time. One factor
resulting in increased attack performance is the frequency
of advertisements. Exposure notiﬁcation advertisements are
transmitted once every 260 to 280ms, and Find My every 2s.
This leads to only 3-4 packets recorded in 1s and 1 packet
every 2s respectively. As such, we lower the threshold for the
minimum number of packets required for inference leading to
false positives. The problem disappears with 10s as sufﬁcient
count of BLE advertisements are recorded.
B. Impact of Bluetooth Chipset
We analyze whether the attack affects all devices equally, or
if certain devices are more vulnerable. We use the setup from

TABLE I: Probability of linking an advertisements to a BTC
device for different devices and recording sizes.
Scenario A, with all our devices streaming audio over BTC
and concurrently broadcasting BLE transmissions. For this
experiment, to remove any app speciﬁc artifacts, we used nRF
Connect for the BLE advertisements on Android devices. We
chose nRF Connect for Android because our analysis showed
it is more stable than other apps. This could be due to the fact
that all other apps perform intensive cryptographic operations.
Similar to the previous experiment, we recorded 10 seconds
of RF spectrum every minute for 30 minutes, and then split
the data into different chunks based on recording intervals.
Table I summarizes the results showing the probability of
linking BLE advertisements to same-device BTC transmis-
sions, for each test device. Note that for Apple iPhone X we
use Immuni as we found it to be reliable on iOS, unlike nRF
Connect which is not as conﬁgurable as its Android coun-
terpart. The probability values range between 84% (Xiaomi
Mi8) for 1s recordings to 100% for 10s. The probability for
10s is 100% for all devices in our set showing that the attack
is robust across devices and chipsets. Comparing all devices,
we see slight differences in linkability that we mostly attribute
to the spectrum being congested.
Although our results indicate that the performance of the
attack is not related to the device, we did observe some arti-
facts during our experiments. We observed that the alignment
between BLE and BTC is tighter for some devices/chipsets.
For example, we ﬁnd that both Samsung Galaxy S6 phones
(SGS6(1) and SGS6(2)) have a very similar mismatch per
packet, between 5µs to 10µs. On the other hand, Xiaomi Mi8
and Pixel 3A BTC-BLE packets are generally more tightly
synchronized, with errors per packet of at most 2µs.
C. Impact of App and Advertisement Conﬁguration
We analyze the potential impact of different advertisement
conﬁgurations like transmit power and latency on attack per-
formance. For this evaluation, we ran measurements placing
a Samsung Galaxy S6 and an iPhone X in our Scenario A.
To compare both the impact of different apps using BLE
and the advertisement conﬁguration itself, we ran Find My
on iPhone X and Immuni, StopCovid, and two parallel BLE
advertisers using nRF connect on the Samsung Galaxy S6.
The ﬁrst nRF Connect advertiser was setup with the same low
latency conﬁguration as StopCovid (i.e., 100ms), whereas the
second advertiser was setup to emulate exposure notiﬁcation
conﬁguration latency (i.e., 250ms). Both nRF advertisers were
set to transmit at higher transmission power than StopCovid
and Exposure Notiﬁcation. StopCovid and Find My also
transmit with higher power than Exposure Notiﬁcation. We

BLE advertisement apps for 1s recordings.
(b) Time alignment between BTC and different
BLE advertisement apps for 10s recordings.

advertisement apps for 1s and 10s recording time.
place the test device within 10 meters of the attack system
and recorded for 10s every minute for 1 hour. We computed
the RMSE of the time alignment for each advertiser separately.
The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 8a
and Figure 8b. The ﬁgures show the empirical CDF of the
RMSE for the 4 different advertisements for 1s and 10s
chunks, respectively. We observe that nRF Connect is more
successfully linked to BTC transmissions for 1s recordings,
even with low latency conﬁgurations. This is due to their
higher power. For 1s recordings, StopCovid is linked 71%
of the times, whereas Immuni is linked 63% of the times.
Find My is able to be linked 46% of the times due to its
high transmit latency (period) of 2s. For 10s recordings, we
ﬁnd that the performance of the attack for Immuni, StopCovid
and Find My increases to 83% and ≈100% respectively. In
case of Immuni, we observed that Immuni frequently stopped
transmitting on channel 37 and only 10% of the 1s recordings
had Immuni transmissions on channel 37. Moreover, in 15% of
the recordings the decoder did not ﬁnd any packets transmitted
for Immuni on either channel 37 or 38, which explains the
lower performance.
D. Impact of Device Density
Crowded scenarios can impose a challenge for an attacker
trying to reliably perform the attack for two main reasons.
First, the RF spectrum is more congested and some transmis-
sions might not be scheduled correctly or get overshadowed
by other devices transmitting at higher power. Secondly, as
the number of devices grow, the probability of having another
device with similar clock values increases.
We ﬁrst study these issues by using the setup described in
Scenario B, a noisy ofﬁce environment with more than 100

transmitting.This leads to 30 total number of BTC devices,
similar to the BTC density in Scenario B, while BLE advertise-
ments density remain low to average. Our results show that, for
this scenario, Exposure Notiﬁcation and StopCovid linkability
probabilities increase to 76% and 71% for 1s recordings,
whereas 10s recordings increase linkability above 97% for
both apps. Comparing these results to the ones on Scenario
B, we ﬁnd that BLE is generally the bottleneck for the attack,
due to its limited channels and lower power transmissions,
whereas BTC has higher power and transmissions are not as
impacted by interference and collisions.
E. Impact of Mobile Device BTC Trafﬁc
Even when an active BTC session is not taking place, in
many cases, a paired device may still remain connected. In
such cases, the device may not transmit several BTC packets
but still periodically send BTC keep-alive packets to the paired
device. An attacker can exploit these keep-alive packets to
execute the attack.
To test the impact of these periodic keep-alive transmissions,
we used three smartphones - Xiaomi Mi8, Samsung Galaxy
S6 and Motorola Moto G5 Plus in our Scenario A setup.
We paired each one of these devices to a Bluetooth headset,
but did not stream any music to them. As a result, these
BTC connections were idle during the experiment with the
exception of the keep-alive packets. The devices were all setup
to transmit BLE advertisements during the entire experiment
spanning 600s.
Our results indicate that devices in BTC idle mode trans-
mit only few packets per second. For our test devices, this
frequency was between 1.5 and 5 packets per second on
average similar to the BLE advertisement rate. For reference,
the same devices transmit about
ten times more packets
per second when they are streaming audio. Even with the
reduced rate, our results show that the linkability per device
drops, however, it is still quite good. For 10s recordings, we
achieve ≈90% linkability for both nRF Connect and Exposure
Notiﬁcation advertisements. For 1s recordings, we achieve an
attack performance of 80%. This suggests that the attack is
robust even when the transmissions are sporadic, as long as
the BTC and BLE packet timestamps are near each other.
F. Impact of Mobility and Range
As BTC transmissions can travel distances of more than 100
meters, they can be decoded from a distance without dedicated
hardware. However, BLE advertisements are frequently conﬁg-
ured with low transmit power to reduce the transmission range.
A good example of this is Exposure Notiﬁcation which has a
maximum range of 10 meters. As such, distance impacts the
attack performance mainly because of the difﬁculty to decode
BLE transmissions. As for mobility, the Doppler effect due
to relative speeds between receiver and transmitter can shift
the frequency of the received signal, potentially jeopardizing
decoding for both BLE and BTC transmissions.
