x∈Ω
For successfull distinguishing with a high success proba-
bility, the number of samples must be around
N ≈ 1/∆2.
(7)
The distinguishing attack that we brieﬂy describe in this
section is given more in detail in, e.g. [23]. Let us now study
the generating function for the LFSR f (·) closer. From [24]
a ω-weight multiple will have the degree roughly
d = (ω − 1)!1/(ω−1)2n/(ω−1),
where n is the size of the LFSR, and the weight ω ≥ 3.
It means that one could ﬁnd another parity check function
f(·) = 0 for the stream u that will be valid with the bias
∆ = 2ω−1ω.
Therefore, considering the required number of samples
from (7), and the degree of the parity check polynomial,
we derive the required length of the keystream L to be
L ≈ d + N = (ω − 1)!
1
ω−1 · 2
n
ω−1 +
1
(2ω−1ω)2 .
For the stream cipher Grain we have n = 80 and  =
2−9.678, and with ω = 3 the length of the keystream required
is
LGrain ≈ 240.5 + 254.
Recall,
in equation (4) we actually gave 8 approxima-
tions, each of which will lead to a diﬀerent sequence ui, i =
1, . . . , 8. But the parity check function f(·) will still remain
the same. It means that at every time instance t eight sam-
ples can be received, instead of one. Therefore, the ﬁnal
length of the keystream required for the successfull distin-
guishing attack is
LGrain ≈ 8−1 · 254 = 251.
6. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have analysed the class of stream ciphers
“Grain”. We have shown that the strength of this family
is based on the diﬃculty of the general decoding problem.
We analysed the stream cipher Grain and derived a distin-
guishing attack for this instance. Our distinguisher requires
around O(251) bits of the keystream, and has time complex-
ity O(254). We detalize the distinguisher in Table 1.
Table 1: The distinguisher for Grain.
Assume we found f(x) = 1 + xa + xb = 0, then:
I := 0
for t = 0 . . . 251
(time instances)
for i = 1, . . . , 8
(eight approximations)
if (ui
t+b) = ci then I := I + 1
t + ui
t+a + ui
if (I/254 − 1/2)  1/2
0,
1, otherwise
To improve the design of Grain the following few sugges-
tions can be given.
A The functions g and h have to be changed. To lower the
bias of the correlation , the number of free linear terms
from the state of the NLFSR should be increased;
B We also believe that this cipher might have an eﬃcient
software implementation as well, if the taps for the func-
tions will be chosen properly. For example, if the most
taps are located close to each other, on the maximum dis-
tance r, then one could create a precomputed table of size
2r to receive the result of the function (or a sub result of
a function) immediately, through just one look-up table.
The structure with close taps could also be used to pro-
duce several bits of output using the minimum number
of table look-ups.
We would like to note other possible further directions in
cryptanalysis of Grain as follows.
1. In our distinguisher we have used only eight linear ap-
proximations in (4). However, we believe that the use of
other approximations with smaller biases could give us a
stronger attack;
2. We believe that the exploited correlation can also be
turned into the key-recovery attack. There is a set of
diﬀerent techniques that use this kind of correlation to
ﬁnd the initial state of the LFSR, e.g. in [25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30], and other literature. Whenever the initial state of
the LFSR is found, the state of NLFSR can be recovered
as well.
