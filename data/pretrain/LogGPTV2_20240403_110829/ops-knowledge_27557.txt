User: What is the easiest way to install python 2 plus lxml plus mechanize on windows? I'm looking for a solution that is easy to follow and also makes it easy to install other libraries (eggs?) in the future.
Edit
I want to be able to install libraries which require a compiler. Ruby for windows has a dev kit which allows you to easily install gems that require a compiler. I'm looking for a similar setup for Python.
Assistant: I'm not happy with any of the solutions offered. Hopefully someone will come along with a better one but for now it seems safe to say that there is no simple solution for installing python + mechanize + lxml + arbitrary other libraries on windows.
