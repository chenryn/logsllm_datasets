### Experimental Parameters and Considerations

The following values are used for a full resolution of \( n = 1024 \) pixels:
- Monitor width: \( x = 30 \) cm
- Distance from the eye to the monitor: \( a_0 = 50 \) cm
- Wavelength: \( \lambda = 600 \) nm
- Angle: \( \gamma = 0 \) (constant)

In most cases, a fraction of the full resolution is sufficient to achieve good results. In such cases, the distance or diameter can be adjusted by a corresponding factor. Increasing the diameter has two negative effects for the attacker:
1. The telescope becomes increasingly large, making it difficult to hide.
2. The cost of telescopes increases rapidly with the diameter. For astronomical telescopes, the mirror is the most expensive part (lenses are even more expensive and rarely used in large telescopes). We consider only the price of the mirror; prices from three randomly selected manufacturers are shown in Figure 17. Note that prices for mirrors of the same size can vary depending on the manufacturer, quality, and finishing.

### Rayleigh Criterion and Imaging Quality

The Rayleigh Criterion is specifically stated for the human eye. Typical telescopes have imaging quality lower than the Rayleigh Bound due to inaccuracies in lenses and mirrors. While cameras and post-processing can improve resolution, the Rayleigh Bound is expected to hold true up to a small constant factor, even with expensive equipment.

Another potential attack scenario involves using techniques from astronomy to enhance imaging quality, such as an array of telescopes or mirrors, as in the Very Large Telescope Project. However, this is technically challenging and typically used for telescopes with diameters greater than 5 meters. An array of 5-meter telescopes is unrealistic in our attack scenario, and the technical challenges of a portable telescope array are unlikely to be resolved at a reasonable cost.

### Exposure Time Limitations

In our experiments, the exposure time was the limiting factor in photographing reflections in the human eye. The reflection is very small, requiring large magnification. As discussed in Section 2.3, the exposure time grows quadratically with magnification.

To derive bounds based on exposure time, similar to what we did for the diameter, we need to consider the quality of the photographic film/chip and other factors that are hard to measure. The exposure time appears to be the actual limiting factor in some of our experiments. It is proportional to the square of the magnification and inversely proportional to the square of the aperture diameter. By extrapolating exposure time values, we can get an idea of the limits imposed by the necessary aperture time. These bounds are correct only if the camera quality is the same as ours and no special algorithmic techniques are used to reconstruct the screen from underexposed pictures.

### Threat Analysis

#### Possibility of Improvement

The experimental results presented here are a first case study. The most obvious improvement would be to use more expensive hardware, such as a larger telescope with a larger diameter and a more sensitive camera to improve exposure time. Methodical and algorithmic improvements are also possible. So far, we have photographed the images and applied simple standard algorithms to improve readability. Advanced deconvolution algorithms or the analysis of sequences of pictures could lead to much better picture quality. For example, in astronomy, "lucky imaging" combines several underexposed pictures to yield a higher-quality image (see Section 3.1).

A single picture of the whole screen is not necessary; a series of photos can be combined in a jigsaw puzzle fashion. We conjecture that the attack can be improved by at least one order of magnitude in both resolution and distance by applying a combination of such techniques.

#### Low Resolution

Even if improvements do not increase the resolution enough to read small fonts on a screen, there are still threats. For example, even with a very unclear picture, it might be possible to guess which program a user is currently using or recognize web pages being browsed. This is particularly effective if there is a limited set of possible candidates to compare with the layout on the screen. Once a web page is identified, the attacker can follow the user's browsing by clicking on links, as the set of links on a given page typically yields a small list of candidates.

Additionally, presentations often use large fonts and can be easily read from a distance, compromising sensitive business information. Blurred diagrams and graphs can also reveal damaging information, such as a bar chart showing confidential sales figures. Even the low resolution achieved when photographing the human eye may pose a threat.

#### Disguise

Standing with a large telescope directly in front of the user is suspicious. The attacker must remain unnoticed. At a distance of 10 meters or more, the telescope can be mounted inside a small van parked near the user's window (assuming a ground-floor office). By opacifying the windows of the van except for one and switching off the lights inside, the telescope should not be visible. A larger distance of 20-30 meters might allow observation from an apartment across the street.

#### Availability of Reflecting Surfaces

Although our experiments were conducted under lab conditions, it is realistic to expect several reflecting surfaces near any given computer. One author's office had five curved reflecting surfaces: a glass, a bottle, a muesli container, a spoon, and the front glass of a wall clock. More organized offices might be less threatened, but the user's eye (or glasses) will always be present.

### Conclusion and Future Work

We have presented a novel eavesdropping technique for spying on data displayed on a monitor from a distance, including LCD monitors. Our technique exploits reflections of the screen's optical emanations in common objects, such as glasses, tea pots, spoons, plastic bottles, and the user's eye. We demonstrated that this attack can be successfully mounted using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment. Using more expensive equipment allowed us to conduct the attack from larger distances, making it feasible to spy from a nearby building.

Particularly good results were obtained from reflections in a user's eyeglasses or a tea pot on the desk. Reflections from the user's eye also provided good results, though they are harder to capture at a distance due to high exposure times. Using more expensive equipment with lower exposure times helps mitigate this issue. We established lower bounds on the size of the telescope and the amount of money needed to carry out this attack in different scenarios, based on physical characteristics like diffraction and exposure time limits. Fully invalidating the attack seems difficult without using curtains or similar forms of optical shielding.

We are currently conducting experiments on a related attack that exploits diffuse reflections on the user's clothes or a nearby wall. This approach is based on the idea that a single monitor pixel produces a slightly directed beam, creating a Point Spread Function (PSF) on the wall. Measuring this function and applying modern deconvolution algorithms allow for partial re-computation of the monitor image. Algorithms exist that work well with high-contrast images, such as text documents on a monitor. While diffuse reflections complicate the situation, initial examples indicate that this approach is feasible under idealized conditions. A diffuse reflection of the letter C and its reconstruction is shown in Figure 18.
