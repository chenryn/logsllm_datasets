These values are for the full resolution n = 1024 pixels;
the monitor width x = 30cm, the monitor distance
(from the eye) a0 = 50cm, the wavelength λ = 600nm,
and the angle γ = 0 are kept constant. In most cases
a fraction of the full resolution is suﬃcient to achieve
good results, in this case the distance or the diameter
can be multiplied/divided by a corresponding factor.
An increasing diameter has two negative eﬀects for
the attacker: First, the telescope gets increasingly large.
Typically the focal length of telescopes increases lin-
early with the diameter, making it diﬃcult to hide the
telescope. Second, the prices of these telescopes in-
crease rapidly with increasing diameter. For astronom-
ical telescopes, the most expensive part is the mirror
(lenses are even more expensive and hardly ever used
in large astronomical telescopes). Thus we consider

selected manufacturers are shown in Figure 17. (Note
that prices for mirrors of the same size can vary depend-
ing on the manufacturer, the quality, and ﬁnishing.)
The Rayleigh Criterion was speciﬁcally stated for
the human eye. The imaging quality of typical tele-
scopes is lower than the Rayleigh Bound, due to in-
accuracies of lenses and mirrors. With the assistance
of cameras and post-processing one could perhaps im-
prove on the resolution. However, even with expensive
equipment, we expect the Rayleigh Bound to be correct
up to a small constant factor.
Another possible attack scenario would be to use
techniques from astronomy to increase imaging quality,
in particular an array of telescopes or mirrors as in the
Very Large Telescope Project. This technically chal-
lenging undertaking is typically only used for telescopes
with a diameter greater than 5 meters. An array of 5
meter telescopes is unrealistic in our attack scenario,
and the technical challenges of a portable telescope ar-
ray are unlikely to be resolved at a reasonable price.
5.2. Based on the Exposure Time
In our experiments, the exposure time was the lim-
iting factor in photographing reﬂections in the human
eye. The reﬂection in the eye is very small, thus large
magniﬁcation is needed. As discussed in Section 2.3,
the exposure time grows quadratically with the magni-
ﬁcation.
Deriving bounds based on the exposure time, sim-
ilarly to what we did in the previous section for the
diameter, depends on the quality of the photographic
ﬁlm/chip an other factors that are hard to measure.
The exposure time seems to be the actual limiting fac-
tor in some of our experiments, and we know that ex-
posure time is proportional to the square of the mag-
niﬁcation and inversely proportional to the square of
the aperture diameter. We can thus extrapolate values
of the exposure time to get an impression about the
limits incurred by the necessary aperture time. One
should keep in mind that bounds obtained in this fash-
ion are correct only assuming a camera of the same
quality as our and assuming that no special algorith-
mic techniques are used to reconstruct the screen from
sequences of underexposed pictures.
6. Threat Analysis
6.1. Possibility of Improvement
The experimental results presented in this paper are
only a ﬁrst case study. The most obvious improvement
10
is to use more expensive hardware: a larger telescope
with larger diameter and a more sensitive camera to
improve the exposure time. Also methodical and al-
gorithmic improvements are possible. So far, we have
photographed the pictures and applied simple standard
algorithms to improve readability. However, advanced
deconvolution algorithms or the analysis of whole se-
quences of pictures might lead to much better picture
quality. For instance, in astronomy there is a technique
called “lucky imaging” where several underexposed pic-
tures are algorithmically combined to yield a picture of
higher quality, see Section 3.1.
A single picture of the whole screen is also not nec-
essary; one could shoot a series of photos and combine
them in a jigsaw puzzle fashion. We conjecture that
the attack can be improved by at least one order of
magnitude in both resolution and distance by applying
a combination of such techniques.
6.2. Low Resolution
Even if improvements on our technique are not suf-
ﬁcient to increase the resolution such that small fonts
on a screen are readable, there are still threats beside
the possibility to read mere text. For example, even
with a very unclear picture of the screen it might be
possible to guess which program a user is currently us-
ing, or even to recognize web pages the user is currently
browsing. The latter in particular works if there is a
limited set of possible candidates with which to com-
pare the layout on the screen. As soon as such a web
page is found, one can follow the browsing user by only
clicking on links, since the set of links on a given page
typically yields a small list of candidates.
Furthermore, presentations generally use very large
fonts and could easily be read from a distance, compro-
mising sensitive business information. If the attacker
has good contextual knowledge, even blurred diagrams
and graphs can reveal damaging information, e.g. a bar
chart showing conﬁdential sales ﬁgures. In these cases,
even the low resolution we achieved when photograph-
ing the human eye might already pose some threat.
6.3. Disguise
Standing with a large telescope directly in front of
the user and observing him obviously causes suspicion.
It is essential for the attacker to be unnoticed. Assum-
ing a distance of 10 meters or more, the telescope could
be mounted inside a small van parked near the window
of the user (assuming a ground ﬂoor oﬃce). Opacify-
ing the windows of the van except for one window and
switching oﬀ lights inside, the telescope should not be

visible. A larger distance of 20-30 meters might even
allow to observe the user from an apartment on the
other side of the road.
6.4. Availability of reﬂecting surfaces
Although our experiments were performed under lab
conditions, it is realistic that there will be several re-
ﬂecting surfaces near any given computer. The oﬃce of
one of the authors had ﬁve curved reﬂecting surfaces:
a glass, a bottle, a muesli container, a spoon, and the
front glass of a wall clock. More tidy oﬃces might be
less threatened but the eye of the user (or even his
glasses) will be present.
7. Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented a novel eavesdropping technique
for spying at a distance on data that is displayed on
an arbitrary monitor, including the currently prevalent
LCD monitors. Our technique exploits reﬂections of
the screen’s optical emanations in objects that one com-
monly ﬁnds in close proximity to the monitor. This
includes glasses, tea pots, spoons, plastic bottles, and
even the eye of the user. We have demonstrated that
this attack can be successfully mounted using inexpen-
sive, oﬀ-the-shelf equipment. Relying on more expen-
sive equipment allowed us to conduct this attack from
larger distances; in particular spying from a close-by
building clearly becomes feasible.
Particularly good results were obtained from reﬂec-
tions in a user’s eyeglasses or a tea pot located on the
desk next to the screen. Reﬂections that stem from the
eye of the user also provide good results. However, eyes
are harder to spy on at a distance because they are fast-
moving objects and require high exposure times. Using
more expensive equipment with lower exposure times
helps to remedy this problem. We have furthermore es-
tablished lower bounds on the size of the telescope (and
consequently the amount of money) needed to carry
out this attack in diﬀerent scenarios, based on physical
characteristics such as diﬀraction as well as bounds on
the permitted exposure times. Fully invalidating the
attack seems diﬃcult, except for using curtains on the
windows or similar forms of optical shielding.
We are currently conducting experiments on a re-
lated attack that is not based on reﬂecting objects, but
rather exploits diﬀuse reﬂections on the user’s clothes
or on a nearby wall. The approach is grounded on the
following idea: A single monitor pixel (in particular for
LCD displays) produces a slightly directed beam; hence
a narrow area of the wall is lightened, which is called
the Point spread function (PSF). Measuring this func-
tion and applying modern deconvolution algorithms
both to this function and the image of the light dis-
tribution on the wall allow for partial re-computation
of the monitor image. Algorithms already exist that
behave well if the original image has high contrasts,
e.g., text documents on a monitor. While diﬀuse reﬂec-
tions naturally complicate the situation, ﬁrst examples
indicate that this approach is feasible at least under
idealized conditions: A diﬀusely reﬂected image of the
letter C and the corresponding reconstruction is shown
in Figure 18.
