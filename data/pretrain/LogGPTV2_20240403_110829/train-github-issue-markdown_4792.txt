##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 3.4.3
##### Detailed description
the bindings generator seems not to respect the `HAVE_OPENCV_*` defines.
##### Steps to reproduce
in cmake set:
    BUILD_LIST=features2d,python3
you will get a compile error like
    opencv/build/modules/python_bindings_generator/pyopencv_generated_types.h:710:46: error: ‘FlannBasedMatcher’ is not a member of ‘cv’
     template<> PyObject* pyopencv_from(const Ptr& r)
as the generator still picks up code guarded by
    #if defined(HAVE_OPENCV_FLANN)
