User: We want to run a Python application on Kubernetes, please provide a suitable Dockerfile and Kubernetes deployment YAML file.
Assistant: Dockerfile: ``` FROM python:3.9-slim WORKDIR /app COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt RUN pip install -r requirements.txt COPY . . CMD ["python", "app.py"] ``` Kubernetes deployment YAML Documentation: ``` apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: python-app labels: app: python spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: python template: metadata: labels: app: python spec: containers: - name: python-app image: your-docker-image-name ports: - containerPort: 5000 imagePullSecrets: - name: your-secret-name --- apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: python-app-service spec : selector: app: python ports: - protocol: TCP port: 5000 targetPort: 5000 type: NodePort ``` Among them, app.py in the Dockerfile is the main module of the Python application, and requirements.txt contains the required dependencies. In the Kubernetes deployment YAML file, you need to provide your Docker image name and provide a key to pull your image from Docker Registry. A service called python-app-service is provided which exposes Python applications on port 5000.
