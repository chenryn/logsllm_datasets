User:  How to deploy a Python application using Docker?
Assistant: 1. First, install the Docker environment, and verify that Docker is running normally in the command line window. 2. Create a new folder, put your Python application in it, and create a new Dockerfile. 3. In the Dockerfile, write the following instructions: ``` # Base image FROM python:3.9.1-alpine # Working directory WORKDIR /app # Copy application code to working directory COPY . /app # Install dependency package RUN pip install - -no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt # Expose port EXPOSE 5000 # Start application CMD ["python", "app.py"] ``` 4. In this folder, run the following command to build the image: ``` docker build -t myapp . ``` 5. Run the following command to start the container: ``` docker run -p 5000:5000 myapp ``` This will start the container and connect the host’s port 5000 with the container’s 5000 ports are bound together. 6. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000, you should be able to see your Python application running.
