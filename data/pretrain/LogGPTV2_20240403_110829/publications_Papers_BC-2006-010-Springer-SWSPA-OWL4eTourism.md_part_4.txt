28 Semantic Web Processes and Their Applications
 The category of a tourist (e.g.
Junior, Young, Senior)
 Describes an activity that can be
carried out a certain place
 Each place has a zip code
 The activity that a person
carries out
 Carrying out an activity or engaging
in an activity are two equivalent properties

 Hotels establish B2B links with
leisure organizations
 Bus tours are offered from place A to
place B
 Describes the weather at a
particular place
 Describes the tourist places with a
good weather
30 Semantic Web Processes and Their Applications
 Describes the places that tourist can
see in Funchal. These places have the zip code 9000,
i.e. the city of Funchal.
9000
 A site seeing package should include
at least 2 places to visit, but no more than 10.

7. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION
Beginner:
1. RDF, RDFS, and OWL are languages that correspond to layers of
the semantic Web stack and are built on top of XML. Why is XML
not itself a semantic language?
2. What are the limitations of RDFS that make it not sufficiently
expressive to describe the semantics of Web resources?
Intermediate:
1. Two instance with a different rdf:ID can actually represent the
same individual. With OWL, how can you make it explicit that the
two instances are different?
2. Use the XMLSchema to define a complex data type to model a
student record (e.g. name, degree, ID, etc.) and reference this data
type within an OWL ontology.
Advanced:
1. OWL is based on the open world assumption. Identify the
characteristics that do not make OWL follow the closed world
assumption.
2. Describe a scenario that illustrates how reasoning engines can use
the owl:unionOf and owl:intersectionOf elements to carry out
inference.
32 Semantic Web Processes and Their Applications
Practical Exercises:
1. Select a Web site, such as www.amazon.com, and develop an
OWL ontology to model the information present on its main page.
2. Validate the OWL ontology developed with an OWL validator
(e.g. http://owl.bbn.com/validator/)
3. Use a reasoning engine, such as JESS
(herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/jess/) to infer knowledge from the
developed ontology.
