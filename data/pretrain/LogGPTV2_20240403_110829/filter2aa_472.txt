# Hacking Mobile Networks via SS7: Interception, Shadowing, and More

**Presenters:**
- Dmitry Kurbatov
- Vladimir Kropotov
- Positive Research

## Agenda
1. Introduction
2. Attack Prerequisites, Costs, and Case Studies
3. Overview of Official and Underground Markets
4. Possible Security Measures
5. Forecasts

## In-Service LTE and VoLTE Networks
- **Current Global Scenario:**
  - Most regions use LTE primarily for web browsing.
  - For voice calls, subscribers are often downgraded to 3G (handover).

- **Interconnect and Roaming:**
  - SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) is the most widely used interconnect and roaming network.
  - Other networks include E1, GRX, IP, and IPX.

- **Key Components:**
  - Mobility
  - Call Control
  - Billing
  - Cryptography

- **SS7 in 2014:**
  - 2014 was a critical year for SS7 security issues.
  - Notable events:
    - Hackito Ergo Sum 2014: Locating mobile phones
    - Positive Hack Days IV: Intercepting conversations globally
    - Washington Post: Secretly tracking cellphones
    - 31C3: SS7: Locate. Track. Manipulate
    - Mobile self-defense strategies

## Threats and Attacks
### Tracking
- **Locating and Tracking:**
  - Methods: Locating mobile phones and secretly tracking users.
  - Common Step 0:
    1. Attacker sends `SendRoutingInfoForSM` request by MSISDN.
    2. HLR responds with its address, serving MSC address, and IMSI.
  - Get Cell ID:
    1. Attacker sends `provideSubscriberInfo` request by IMSI.
    2. MSC responds with Cell ID (MCC, MNC, LAC, CID).

- **Underground Market Demand:**
  - Tracking subscribers using phone numbers.
  - Even in 2010, this was a significant concern.
  - Violation of personal data protection laws.
  - Hard to stop due to methods like `AnyTimeInterrogation`, `ProvideSubscriberInfo`, and `ProvideSubscriberLocation`.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Making Someone Unavailable:**
  - Common Step 0: Same as tracking.
  - Denial of Service Steps:
    1. Attacker registers the target on a fake MSC.
    2. HLR updates the new location for the target.
    3. HLR asks the real MSC to release memory.
    4. When another user tries to call the target, the call is directed to the fake MSC, making the target unavailable.

### Interception
- **SMS Interception:**
  - Methods: 
    - Virus on a smartphone (targeted infection).
    - Reissuing SIM (works only once).
    - Radio signal interception (requires proximity).
    - Via SS7 network (cheaper and more effective).
  - Common Step 0: Same as tracking.
  - SMS Interception Steps:
    1. Attacker registers the target on a fake MSC.
    2. HLR updates the new location for the target.
    3. HLR asks the real MSC to release memory.
    4. Sender sends an SMS to the target.
    5. MSC translates the SMS to SMS-C.
    6. SMS-C requests HLR for the target's location.
    7. HLR responds with the fake MSC address.
    8. SMS-C translates the SMS to the fake MSC.

- **Illegal Uses:**
  - Access to payment services.
  - Password recovery for emails and social networks.
  - Online banking one-time passwords (OTPs).
  - Premium rate SMS subscriptions.
  - Credit card money transfers.
  - Fake calls from the victim's number.

## How to Access SS7
- **Methods:**
  - Legal with a license.
  - Semi-legal without a license.
  - Finding a contact who can provide access.
  - Hacking border devices.
  - Misconfiguration examples.

## Research Updates
- **Critical Areas:**
  - SS7 security threats.
  - Mobile Internet vulnerabilities (GPRS).
  - SIM vulnerabilities.
