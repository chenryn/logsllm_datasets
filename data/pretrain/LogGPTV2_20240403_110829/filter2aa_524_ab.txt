### CDMA Terminology

- **No SIM Cards Needed**: Unlike GSM, CDMA does not use SIM cards.
- **MIN (Mobile Identification Number)**: A 10-digit number, often the same as the user's phone number. This is different from the IMSI used in GSM, which is a more complex identifier.

### Device and Subscriber IDs

- **GSM**:
  - **Device ID**: IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)
  - **Subscriber ID**: IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)
- **CDMA**:
  - **Device ID**: 
    - **ESN (Electronic Serial Number)**: A CDMA-specific 32-bit identifier, e.g., "11 EE 4B 55".
    - **MEID (Mobile Equipment Identifier)**: The successor to ESN, introduced when ESNs ran out. MEIDs are 56-bit identifiers.
    - **Pseudo ESN (pESN)**: Used for backward compatibility with handsets that use MEIDs, e.g., "80 11 EE 4B".
  - **Subscriber ID**:
    - **MIN (Mobile Identification Number)**: A 10-digit number.
    - **MSISDN (Mobile Station International ISDN Number)**: The user's phone number.
    - **MDN (Mobile Directory Number)**: Another term for the user's phone number.

### Authentication and Encryption

- **CAVE (Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption)**:
  - Every CDMA phone has a secret A-Key, which generates two derivative keys used for authentication and encryption of voice traffic.
  - The A-Key is never shared over the network, but the derivative keys are used for every call.

### Cloning Basics

- **Real Towers**:
  - When making a call, the MIN and MEID or ESN are sent unencrypted to the tower to identify the user.
  - This was a significant security flaw, leading to rampant cloning.

### Femtocell Vulnerabilities

- **Femtocells**:
  - Act like regular towers but do not require the MEID for authentication. They use (p)ESN and MIN instead.
  - Femtocells do not enforce CAVE authentication, making them vulnerable to cloning attacks.

### Cloning Process

- **The Perfect Clone**:
  1. **Step 1**: The victim's phone comes within range of a rooted femtocell with a sniffer.
  2. **Step 2**: The MIN and (p)ESN are collected and cloned to a target device.
  3. **Step 3**: The target device is associated with a stock femtocell.
  4. **Step 4**: The clone is operational, allowing calls and SMS on behalf of the original phone.

### Cloning Implications

- **Cloning can be flaky**:
  - **Voice**: Issues with 2.5-way calls.
  - **SMS**: Possible disruptions.
  - **Data**: Not yet fully exploitable.

- **Definitions**:
  - **Victim Phone**: The legitimate subscriber's phone whose keys have been captured.
  - **Target Phone**: The attacker's phone, modified to mimic the victim's phone.

### Cloning Scenarios

- **Scenario 0**: When the victim's phone is turned off or jammed, everything works normally.
- **Scenario 1**: When both the target and victim phones are associated with the femtocell:
  - **Outgoing Call**: Forced drop.
  - **SMS**: Incoming only.
  - **Incoming Call**: Only one phone rings, or both phones ring, leading to a 2.5-way call.
- **Scenario 2**: When only the target phone is associated with the femtocell and the victim's phone is on an actual Verizon tower:
  - **Outgoing Call**: Target's call is dropped.
  - **Incoming Call and SMS**: Most recent carrier contact receives the message.

### Data Cloning

- **Difficulties**:
  - Requires additional keys, valid NAI, HA, and AAA.

### Cloning Patched

- **CAVE Authentication**: Now required on the carrier network, not the femtocell, thus patching the vulnerability without requiring software updates to the femtocell.

### Carrier Comparison

- **Major US Carriers**:
  - **Verizon**: CDMA, uses femtocells.
  - **Sprint**: CDMA, uses femtocells.
  - **AT&T**: GSM, uses femtocells.
  - **T-Mobile**: GSM, does not use femtocells.

### Mitigations

- **Short Term**:
  - Harden femtocell hardware and software.
  - Require phone registration.
- **Long Term**:
  - Eliminate femtocells.
  - Move to WiFi Calling.
  - Implement end-to-end encryption.

### Detection and Protection

- **Detecting Femtocells**:
  - **Android**: Some phones display an icon when connected to a femtocell.
  - **iPhone**: No visual indicator, but a short beep at the beginning of a call (easy to miss).
  - **FemtoCatcher**: An app that detects femtocells and puts the phone in airplane mode.

### Future Work

- **Custom Protocols**:
  - Heavily proxied, forced gzip, chunked encoding, SSL middling, and other techniques.
- **WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)**: Further research and fuzzing.
