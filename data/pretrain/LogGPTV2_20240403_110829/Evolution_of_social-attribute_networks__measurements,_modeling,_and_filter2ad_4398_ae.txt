### Properties Beyond Degree Distributions

Properties beyond degree distributions have been shown to be key metrics for evaluating generative models [37]. We examine the joint degree distribution approximated by the degree correlation function \( k_{nn} \) in Figures 17a and 17c for our model and Zhel. Compared to Figure 12, we observe that the JDD of attribute nodes in our model-generated SAN more closely matches the Google+ SAN than Zhel. A similar pattern is observed for the JDD of social nodes.

### Clustering Coefficient

Figures 17b and 17d show the clustering coefficient distributions of synthetic SANs generated by our model and Zhel, respectively. When compared to Figure 9a, we see that our model generates synthetic SANs with both social and attribute clustering coefficient distributions that closely match those of the Google+ SAN, which is not the case for Zhel.

### Significance of Building Blocks

Our model incorporates two key building blocks: preferential attachment via LAPA and triangle closing via focal closure. To understand the contributions of these components, we conducted the following investigations:

#### Impact of LAPA

We first examined how LAPA impacts the structure of the generated SAN. For this, we considered an intermediate model with classical PA (but with RR-SAN enabled) and computed the previous metrics for SANs generated by this intermediate model. We found that all metrics except the distribution of social indegree were qualitatively the same. Figure 18a shows that the distribution of social indegree of the synthetic SAN generated by our intermediate model is very close to a power-law distribution, unlike the lognormal distribution generated by our full model (Figure 16b) and derived from the real Google+ SAN (Figure 5). This suggests that the LAPA component is necessary for modeling a key aspect of the Google+ SAN.

#### Impact of RR-SAN

Next, we investigated the impact of RR-SAN. The key metric affected by the focal closure component of RR-SAN is the attribute clustering coefficient. Figure 18b shows the social and attribute clustering coefficients of synthetic SANs generated by our model without RR-SAN (with classical RR enabled). By comparing Figures 17b and 18b, we see that RR-SAN has a significant impact on the attribute clustering coefficient.

These results confirm that both attribute-augmented building blocks, LAPA and RR-SAN, play important but complementary roles in generating synthetic SANs that closely mirror the real Google+ SAN.

### Application Fidelity

To evaluate the fidelity of our generative model and the Zhel model, we used two real-world application contexts: Sybil defense and social network-based anonymity. In each case, we used the relevant metrics for each application. Note that these applications rely solely on the social structure.

#### Sybil Defense

In a Sybil attack [14], a single entity emulates multiple identities to compromise the security and privacy properties of a system. Sybil attacks are particularly concerning in decentralized systems, which lack mechanisms to vet identities and perform admission control. Several recent works have proposed using social trust relationships to mitigate Sybil attacks [14, 59]. We evaluated the fidelity of our model using a representative social network-based Sybil defense mechanism called SybilLimit [59].

SybilLimit bounds the effective node degree in the social network topology to prevent adversaries from obtaining a large number of attack edges. Following their guidelines, we imposed a node degree bound of 100 in evaluating their proposal on different SANs. Figure 19a depicts the number of Sybil identities an adversary can insert as a function of the number of compromised nodes in the network. We compromised nodes uniformly at random and set the SybilLimit parameter \( w = 10 \). The parameter \( f_c \) governs the attribute link weight in our RR-SAN component; \( f_c = 0 \) means no focal closure.

We observed that:
- SybilLimit results using the synthetic topology generated by our model closely match the real Google+ data.
- Our model outperforms the baseline approach (Zhel model). For example, when the number of compromised nodes is 200,000, the average number of Sybil identities in the Google+ topology is about 25.3 million, while our model predicts 24.5 million (error of 3.1% using \( f_c = 0.1 \)). In contrast, the baseline approach has almost 4x worse error with a prediction error of 12.5%.

This demonstrates the importance of using attribute information to influence the social structure (the Zhel model only uses the social structure to influence the attribute structure).

#### Anonymous Communication

Anonymous communication aims to hide user identity (IP address) from the recipient or third parties on the Internet. The Tor network [12] is a deployed system for anonymous communication, widely used by political dissidents, journalists, whistleblowers, and law enforcement/military. Recent work [22, 11] has proposed leveraging social links to build anonymous paths for improving resistance to attackers. For example, the Drac [11] system selects proxies (onion routers) by performing a random walk on the social network. If the first and last hops of the forwarding path (onion routing circuit) are compromised, an adversary can perform end-to-end timing analysis and break user anonymity. Figure 19b depicts the probability of end-to-end timing analysis when random walks on social networks are performed for anonymous communication, using the Google+ social network and our synthetic network. Similar to our SybilLimit experiments, we compromised nodes uniformly at random in the network and imposed an upper bound of 100 on the node degree. Again, we can see the accuracy of our model and the improvement over prior work.

### Summary

Through evaluating our model with respect to network metrics and real-world applications, we find that:
- Our model can reproduce SANs that well match the Google+ SAN in terms of various network metrics (e.g., degree distributions, joint degree distributions, and clustering coefficients), whereas the Zhel model cannot match several metrics (e.g., social degree distributions, joint degree distributions, and clustering coefficients).
- Our model performs better than the Zhel model for real-world applications such as Sybil defense and anonymous communication.
- The two attribute-augmented building blocks, LAPA and RR-SAN, play important but complementary roles in our model.

### Discussion

#### Using Attributes to Strengthen Defenses

Our evaluation primarily focuses on how our model better matches the real-world SAN. We hypothesize that several attack defenses (e.g., Sybil proofing) can be enhanced by considering the attribute structure. For example, we could check if the attribute structure of nodes matches normal nodes, or even if an attacker manages to obtain a "compromised" edge to one node, we can limit the influence of this compromised edge by checking the attribute structure.

#### LAPA Computation

The LAPA model requires a costly linear time step when a new node arrives. This is because we must consider the number of common attributes between the new node and each current node, unlike PA, which only needs the global degree distribution. Fortunately, we can approximate LAPA using a practical heuristic. The high-level idea is to pick one of the new node's attributes at random and use PA within the nodes having this attribute. This approximates LAPA as nodes sharing more attributes are more likely to get selected.

#### Dynamic Attributes

Our model currently focuses on static attributes that nodes pick when they join the SAN. In future work, we plan to incorporate dynamic attributes and investigate whether the static attribute structure also influences the selection of dynamic attributes. Note that static attributes influence the social structure in our model, while dynamic attributes are influenced by the social structure in the model from Zheleva et al. [61].

#### Parameter Inference

We currently use a guided greedy search to empirically estimate model parameters. While this works well, we plan to develop a more rigorous parameter inference algorithm based on the maximum-likelihood principle [31, 57].

#### Parsimoniousness of Our Model

In ยง 6, we have shown that each component of our model is necessary. However, it is an interesting future work to design a more parsimonious model.

#### Implications for Social Network Designs

Our results that users sharing common employer attributes are more likely to be linked than users sharing other attributes can help design a better friend recommendation system, a fundamental component of online social networks.

#### Relationship to Heterogeneous Networks

Our SAN can be viewed as a heterogeneous network since it consists of multiple types of nodes and links. Heterogeneous networks have been shown to work better than traditional homogeneous networks for various data mining tasks such as link prediction [17, 58, 48, 49], attribute inference [17, 58], and community detection [51, 50, 62]. It is an interesting future work to generalize our new attribute-related metrics and generative model to other heterogeneous networks.

### Related Work

Given the growing role of social networks in users' lives and the potential for using such insights for building better systems and applications, there is a rich literature on measuring and modeling social networks. Next, we discuss our work in the context of this related work. At a high level, our specific new contributions are:
1. Characterizing the evolution of a new large-scale network (Google+).
2. Providing measurement-driven insights and models on the impact of attributes on social network evolution.

#### Measuring Social Networks

Many prior efforts characterize social networks using the network metrics we also describe in ยง3 [26, 28, 29, 38, 25]. Most of these focus on static snapshots; a few notable works also focus on evolutionary aspects similar to our work [3, 56, 4]. Schioberg et al. [46] studied a few network metrics, geographic distribution of users and links, and correlation of users' public information of Google+ using multiple snapshots. Gonzalez et al. [18] characterized several key features of Google+ during its first 10 months and compared them to Facebook and Twitter. Magno et al. [36] identified the key differences between Google+ and Facebook and Twitter, studied the adoption patterns of Google+ in different countries, and characterized the variation of privacy concerns across different cultures. Zhao et al. [60] studied the early evolution of the Renren social network and analyzed its network dynamics at different granularities to determine their influence on individual users. While we follow the spirit of these works, our work is unique in terms of the specific dataset (i.e., three phases of Google+), the scale of the network, and the fact that we had a singular opportunity to study the evolution across different phases.

There has been a recent realization of the importance of user attributes in characterizing social networks [38, 61]. These focus on the influence of social structure on dynamic node attributes (e.g., interest groups). Our work focuses on the orthogonal dimension of analyzing and modeling the influence of static node attributes on social structure formation using Google+.

#### Modeling Social Networks

There are two broad classes of models for generating social networks: static and dynamic. Static models try to reproduce a single static network snapshot [15, 55, 37, 47]. Dynamic models provide insights into how nodes arrive and create links; these include models such as preferential attachment [5], copying [24], nearest neighbor [2], and forest fire [33]. Sala et al. [43] evaluated such models using both network metrics and application benchmarks and showed that the nearest neighbor model outperforms others. The dynamic/generative model by Leskovec et al. mimics the nearest neighbor model in a dynamic setting [29], and thus we use it as our starting point in ยง5. However, these models are known to generate networks with power-law degree distributions. Many social networks, including Google+, exhibit lognormal degree distributions [16, 32, 34]. Our dynamic model extends these prior works to provably generate a lognormal distribution for social outdegree. Our model also provides a more general framework by capturing both social and attribute structure.

#### Modeling Social-Attribute Networks

There has been relatively little work on generating SANs, though a few recent works jointly generating both social structure and node attributes can be viewed as SAN models. The most relevant work is from Zheleva et al. [61] and Kim and Leskovec [23]. Zheleva et al. [61] focus on dynamic attributes; their model generates undirected networks with power-law distribution for social degree and non-lognormal distribution for attribute degree (see Figure 16). Kim and Leskovec model the social and attribute structure simultaneously [23]. Here, both the social degree of attribute nodes and attribute degrees of social nodes follow binomial distribution, which differs from empirically observed SANs. Our model can generate SANs that we confirm through both analysis and simulations to be consistent with real SANs.

### Conclusion

Using a unique dataset collected by crawling Google+ since its launch in June 2011, we provide a first-principled understanding of the attribute structure and its impact on the social structure and their evolutions with the SAN model. We observe several interesting phenomena in the structure and evolution of Google+. For example, the social degree distributions are lognormal, the assortativity is neutral while many other social networks have positive assortativities, and distinct phases in the evolution manifest themselves in the network structure. We also provide new metrics for characterizing the attribute structure and demonstrate that attributes can significantly impact the social structure. Building on these empirical insights, we provide a new generative model for SANs and validate that it is close to the real Google+ SAN using both network metrics and real application contexts. We believe that our work is one of the first steps in this regard and that there are several interesting directions for future work to harness the power of using the attribute structure for designing better social network-based systems and applications.
