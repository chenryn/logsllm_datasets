properties beyond the degree distributions has been shown to be a
key metric for evaluating generative models [37]. Thus, we look
at the joint degree distribution approximated by degree correla-
tion function knn in Figure 17a and 17c for our model and Zhel.
Compared to Figure 12, we see that the JDD of attribute nodes in
our model generated SAN matches Google+ SAN much better than
Zhel. We observe similar pattern for JDD of social nodes.
Clustering coefﬁcient: Fig. 17b and Fig. 17d shows the clustering
coefﬁcient distributions of synthetic SANs generated by our model
and Zhel, respectively. When comparing them to Fig. 9a we see
that our model generates synthetic SAN with both social and at-
tribute clustering coefﬁcient distributions matching well to those of
Google+ SAN, which is not the case for Zhel.
Signiﬁcance of building blocks: Recall that our model has two
key building blocks that extend preferential attachment via LAPA
and also extending triangle closing via focal closure. A natural
question is what each of these components contribute toward the
overall generative model.
First, we investigate how LAPA impacts the structure of the gen-
erated SAN in our model. To this end, we consider an interme-
diate model with the classical PA (but with the RR-SAN enabled)
and compute the previous metrics for SANs generated by this in-
termediate model. We ﬁnd that all metrics except the distribution
of social indegree are qualitatively the same. Figure 18a shows
that the distribution of social indegree of the synthetic SAN gener-
ated by our intermediate model is very close to a power-law distri-
bution, different from the lognormal distribution generated by our
full model shown in Figure 16b and derived from the real Google+
SAN shown in Figure 5. This suggests that the LAPA component
is necessary for modeling a key aspect of the Google+ SAN.
Second, we investigate the impact of RR-SAN. The key met-
ric impacted by the focal closure component of RR-SAN is the
attribute clustering coefﬁcient. Figure 18b shows the social and
attribute clustering coefﬁcients of synthetic SANs generated by our
model without RR-SAN (with classical RR enabled). Looking at
Figure 17b and Figure 18b together, we see that RR-SAN has a
signiﬁcant impact on the attribute clustering coefﬁcient.
These results conﬁrm both attribute-augmented building blocks,
LAPA and RR-SAN, play important but complementary roles in
our model in generating synthetic SAN that closely mirrors the real
Google+ SAN.
6.2 Application Fidelity
Next, we use two real-world application contexts to evaluate the
ﬁdelity of our generative model and the Zhel model with respect to
(a) Sybil defense:

nodes. (b) Social network based anonymity: Probability of end-to-
end timing analysis as a function of number of compromised nodes.
a real Google+ snapshot. In each case, we use the metric of interest
relevant to each application. Note that all these applications only
rely on the social structure.
Sybil defense: In a Sybil attack [14], a single entity emulates the
behavior of a large number of identities to compromise the secu-
rity and privacy properties of a system. Sybil attacks are of par-
ticular concern in decentralized systems, which lack mechanisms
to vet identities and perform admission control. Several recent
works have proposed the use of social trust relationships to miti-
gate Sybil attacks [14, 59]. Next, we show the ﬁdelity of our model
using a representative social network based Sybil defense mecha-
nism called SybilLimit [59].
In order to prevent an adversary from obtaining a large number
of attack edges (edges between compromised and honest users),
SybilLimit bounds the effective node degree in the social network
topology. Following their guidelines, we also imposed a node de-
gree bound of 100 in evaluating their proposal on the different
SANs. Figure 19a depicts the number of Sybil identities that an ad-
versary can insert, as a function of number of compromised nodes
in the network. We compromised the nodes uniformly at random,
and set the SybilLimit parameter w = 10. The parameter f c gov-
erns the attribute link weight in our RR-SAN component; f c = 0
means no focal closure.
We can see that (a) SybilLimit results using the synthetic topol-
ogy generated by our model are a close match to the real Google+
data, and (b) our model outperforms the baseline approach (Zhel
model). For example, when the number of compromised nodes
is 200,000 the average number of Sybil identities in the Google+
topology is about 25.3 million, while our model predicts 24.5 mil-
lion (error of 3.1% using f c = 0.1). In contrast, the baseline ap-
proach has almost 4× worse error with a prediction error of 12.5%.
This shows the importance of using attribute information to inﬂu-
ence the structure of the social structure (the Zhel model only uses
the social structure to inﬂuence the attribute structure.)
Anonymous communication: Anonymous communication aims
to hide user identity (IP address) from the recipient (destination)
or from third parties on the Internet such as autonomous systems.
The Tor network [12] is a deployed system for anonymous com-
munication that serves hundreds of thousands of users a day.
It
is widely used by political dissidents, journalists, whistle-blowers,
and even law enforcement/military. Recent work [22, 11] has pro-
posed leveraging social links in building anonymous paths for im-
proving resistance to attackers. For example, the Drac [11] system
selects proxies (onion routers) by performing a random walk on the
social network. For low-latency communications, if the ﬁrst and the
last hops of the forwarding path (onion routing circuit) are compro-

and break user anonymity. Figure 19b depicts the probability of
end-to-end timing analysis when random walks on social networks
are performed for anonymous communication, using the Google+
social network and our synthetic network. Similar to our Sybil-
Limit experiments, we compromise nodes uniformly at random in
the network, and impose an upper bound of 100 on the node de-
gree. Again, we can see the accuracy of our model, as well as the
improvement over prior work.
6.3 Summary
Via evaluating our model with respect to network metrics and
real-world applications, we ﬁnd that:
• Our model can reproduce SANs that well match Google+ SAN
with respect to various network metrics (e.g., degree distribu-
tions, joint degree distributions and clustering coefﬁcients.), but
the Zhel model cannot match several metrics (e.g., social de-
gree distributions, joint degree distributions and clustering co-
efﬁcient.).
• Our model also performs better than the Zhel model for real-
world applications such as Sybil defense and anonymous com-
munication.
• The two attribute-augmented building blocks, i.e., LAPA and
RR-SAN, play important but complementary roles in our model.
7. DISCUSSION
Using attributes to strengthen defenses: Our evaluation largely
focuses on how our model better matches the real-world SAN. We
hypothesize that several attack defenses (e.g., Sybil prooﬁng) can
also be enhanced by taking into account the attribute structure. For
example, we could check if the attribute structure of the nodes
matches normal nodes, or even if an attacker manages to obtain
a “compromised” edge to one node we can limit the inﬂuence of
this compromised edge by checking the attribute structure.
LAPA Computation: The LAPA model as described requires a
costly linear time (in number of nodes) step when a new node ar-
rives. This is because we have to consider the number of common
attributes between the new node and each current node, unlike PA
which only needs the global degree distribution. Fortunately, we
can approximate LAPA using a practical heuristic. The high-level
idea is to pick one of the new node’s attributes at random and use
PA within the nodes having this attribute. This approximates LAPA
as nodes sharing more attributes are more likely to get selected.
Dynamic attributes: Our model currently focuses on static at-
tributes that nodes pick when they join the SAN. In our future work,
we plan to incorporate dynamic attributes, and investigate whether
the static attribute structure also inﬂuences the selection of dynamic
attributes. Note that static attributes inﬂuence the social structure in
our model while the dynamic attributes are inﬂuenced by the social
structure in the model from Zheleva et al [61].
Parameter inference: We currently use a guided greedy search
to empirically estimate model parameters. While this works quite
well, we plan to develop a more rigorous parameter inference algo-
rithm based on maximum-likelihood principle [31, 57].
Parsimoniousness of our model: In § 6, we have shown that each
component of our model is necessary. However, it’s an interesting
future work to design a more parsimonious model.
Implications for social network designs: Our results that users
sharing common employer attributes are more likely to be linked
than users sharing other attributes can help design a better friend
recommendation system, which is a very fundamental component
of online social networks.
Relationship to heterogeneous networks: Our SAN can be viewed
as a heterogeneous network since it consists of multiple types of
nodes and links. Heterogeneous networks are shown recently to
work better than traditional homogeneous networks for various data
mining tasks such as link prediction [17, 58, 48, 49], attribute in-
ference [17, 58] and community detection [51, 50, 62].
It is an
interesting future work to generalize our new attribute-related met-
rics and generative model to other heterogeneous networks.
8. RELATED WORK
Given the growing role of social networks in users’ lives and
the potential for using such insights for building better systems
and applications, there is a rich literature on measuring and mod-
eling social networks. Next, we discuss our work in the context of
this related work. At a high-level, our speciﬁc new contributions
are: (1) we characterize the evolution of a new large-scale network
(Google+), and (2) we provide measurement-driven insights and
models on the impact of attributes on social network evolution.
Measuring social networks: Many prior efforts characterize so-
cial networks using the network metrics we also describe in §3 [26,
28, 29, 38, 25]. Most of these focus on static snapshots; a few no-
table work also focus on evolutionary aspects similar to our work [3,
56, 4]. With multiple Google+ snapshots crawled around its public
release, Schioberg et al. [46] studied a few network metrics, geo-
graphic distribution of the users and links, and correlation of users’
public information of Google+.
Concurrently, Gonzalez et al. [18] characterize several key fea-
tures of Google+ during its ﬁrst 10 months, and compare them to
those of Facebook and Twitter. Using a static Google+ snapshot
crawled after its public release, Magno et al. [36] identify the key
differences between Google+ and Facebook and Twitter, study the
adoption patterns of Google+ in different countries, and character-
ize the variation of privacy concerns across different cultures. Zhao
et al. [60] study the early evolution of the Renren social network,
and analyze its network dynamics at different granularities to de-
termine their inﬂuence on individual users. While we follow the
spirit of these works, our work is unique in terms of the speciﬁc
dataset (i.e., three phases of Google+), the scale of the network,
and the fact that we had a singular opportunity to study the evolu-
tion across different phases.
There has been recent realization of the importance of user at-
tributes in characterizing social networks [38, 61]. These focus on
the inﬂuence of social structure on dynamic node attributes (e.g.,
interest groups). Our work focuses on the orthogonal dimension of
analyzing and modeling the inﬂuence of static node attributes on
social structure formation using Google+.
Modeling social networks: There are two broad classes of models
for generating social networks: static and dynamic. Static models
try to reproduce a single static network snapshot [15, 55, 37, 47].
Dynamic models can provide insights on how nodes arrive and cre-
ate links; these include models such as preferential attachment [5],
copying [24], nearest neighbor [2], forest ﬁre [33]. Sala et al. [43]
evaluated such models using both network metrics and application
benchmarks and showed that the nearest neighbor model outper-
forms others. The dynamic/generative model by Leskovec et al.
mimics the nearest neighbor model in a dynamic setting [29], and
thus we use it as our starting point in §5, However, these models are
known to generate networks with power-law degree distributions.
Many social networks including Google+, however, exhibit lognor-
mal degree distributions [16, 32, 34]. Our dynamic model extends
142these prior work to provably generate a lognormal distribution for
social outdegree. Our model also provides a more general frame-
work by capturing both social and attribute structure.
Modeling social-attribute networks: There has been relatively
little work on generating SANs, though a few recent work jointly
generating both social structure and node attributes can be viewed
as SAN models; the most relevant work is from Zheleva et al. [61]
and Kim and Leskovec [23]. Zheleva et al. [61] focus on dynamic
attributes; their model generates undirected networks with power-
law distribution for social degree and non-lognormal distribution
for attribute degree (see Figure 16). Kim and Leskovec model
the social and attribute structure simultaneously [23]. Here, both
the social degree of attribute nodes and attribute degrees of social
nodes follow binomial distribution, which differs from empirically
observed SANs. Our model can generate SANs that we conﬁrm
through both analysis and simulations to be consistent with real
SANs.
9. CONCLUSION
Using a unique dataset collected by crawling Google+ since its
launch in June 2011, we provide a ﬁrst-principled understanding of
the attribute structure and its impact on the social structure and their
evolutions with the SAN model. We observe several interesting
phenomena in the structure and evolution of Google+. For exam-
ple, the social degree distributions are lognormal, the assortativity
is neural while many other social networks have positive assortativ-
ities, and the distinct phases in the evolution manifest themselves
in the network structure. We also provide new metrics for charac-
terizing the attribute structure and demonstrate that attributes can
signiﬁcantly impact the social structure. Building on these empir-
ical insights, we provide a new generative model for SANs and
validate that it is close to the real Google+ SAN using both net-
work metrics and real application contexts. We believe that our
work is one of the ﬁrst steps in this regard and that there are several
interesting directions for future work to harness the power of us-
ing the attribute structure for designing better social network based
systems and applications.
