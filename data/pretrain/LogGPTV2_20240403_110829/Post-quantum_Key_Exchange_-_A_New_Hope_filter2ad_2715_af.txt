multiplication on an Intel Haswell [44]. Also OpenSSL
optionally includes fast software for nistp256 ECDH
by Käsper and Langley and we assume that the authors
of [20] omitted enabling it. Compared to BCNS, our
C implementation is more than 8 times faster and our
AVX implementation even achieves a speedup factor of
more than 27. At this performance it is in the same ball-
park as state-of-the-art ECDH software, even when TLS
switches to faster 128-bit secure ECDH key exchange

based on Curve25519 [11], as recently speciﬁed in RFC
7748 [59].
In comparison to the BCNS proposal we see a large
performance advantage from switching to the binomial
error distribution. The BCNS software uses a large pre-
computed table to sample from a discrete Gaussian dis-
tribution with a high precision. This approach takes
1042700 cycles to samples one polynomial in constant
time. Our C implementation requires only 32684 cy-
cles to sample from the binomial distribution. Another
factor is that we use the NTT in combination with a
smaller modulus. Polynomial multiplication in [20] is
using Nussbaumer’s symbolic approach based on re-
cursive negacyclic convolutions [76]. The implemen-
tation in [20] only achieves a performance of 342800
cycles for a constant-time multiplication. Additionally,
the authors of [20] did not perform pre-transformation
of constants (e.g., a) or transmission of coefﬁcients in
FFT/Nussbaumer representation.
Follow-Up Work. We would like to refer the reader to
follow-up work in which improvements to NEWHOPE
and its implementation were proposed based on a
preprint version of this work [4].
In [45] Gueron and
Schlieker introduce faster pseudorandom bytes gener-
ation by changing the underlying functions, a method
to decrease the rejection rate during sampling (see Sec-
tion 7.1), and a vectorization of the sampling step. Longa
and Naehrig [64] optimize the NTT and present new
modular reduction techniques and are able to achieve a
speedup of factor-1.90 for the C implementation and a
factor-1.25 for the AVX implementation compared to the
preprint [4] (note that this version has updated numbers).
An alternative NTRU-based proposal and implementa-
tion of a lattice-based public-key encryption scheme,
which could also be used for key exchange, is given by
Bernstein, Chuengsatiansup, Lange, and van Vredendaal
in [15], but we leave a detailed comparison to future
work. An efﬁcient authenticated lattice-based key ex-
change scheme has recently been proposed by del Pino,
Lyubashevsky, and Pointcheval in [30].
