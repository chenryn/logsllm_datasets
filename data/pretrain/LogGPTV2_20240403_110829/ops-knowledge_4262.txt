User: If subprocess.call is invoked N times, I wonder if N subprocess will be created or not.
And when will the subprocess close? Should I kill it manually?
What about subprocess.Popen?
Assistant: Yes, a new process is spawned every time you call subprocess.call() or any of its relatives, including Popen().  You do not need to explicitly kill the subprocesses normally--you'd just wait for them to exit.
