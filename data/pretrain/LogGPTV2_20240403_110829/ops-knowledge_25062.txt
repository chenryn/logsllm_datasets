User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What's a good tool for collecting statistics on filesystem usage? We have a number of filesystems for our computational cluster, with a lot of users that store a lot of really large files. We'd like to monitor the filesystem and help optimize their usage of it, as well as plan for expansion.

In order to this, we need some way to monitor how these filesystems are used. Essentially I'd like to know all sorts of statistics about the files:


Age
Frequency of access
Last accessed times
Types
Sizes


Ideally this information would be available in aggregate form for any directory so that we could monitor it based on project or user.

Short of writing something up myself in Python, I haven't been able to find any tools capable of performing these duties. Any recommendations?

Assistant: You probably want something that will log file system events with inotify.  Maybe something like logsend.  Also see inotify-tools.
