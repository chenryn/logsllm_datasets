### Confirming Authorization and Authentication for API Security

To ensure that requests are authorized, all requests to non-public APIs must be authenticated. Single sign-on (SSO) has become the standard for enterprise applications. If either authorization or authentication is weak or missing, threat actors can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending API calls to the underlying application or service to extract or modify data. Undocumented API endpoints that make it into production are particularly risky, as they may not have been intended for public access and often bypass thorough security testing.

### The Role of APIs in Modern Web Applications

Modern web applications frequently use API calls to exchange information between components, especially with the shift towards microservices and serverless architectures. Instead of storing and executing all application code on a central server, developers implement operations as separate web services that communicate via APIs. A single web application can consist of dozens of services or hundreds of microservices, depending on the design. This API-driven approach enables agile development and rapid innovation, as teams can work in parallel to build independent components without waiting for a larger release.

Web APIs can also serve as a standalone, multi-purpose back-end, delivering data and performing operations for multiple websites, business systems, mobile apps, IoT devices, and more. This simplifies and accelerates the creation of new applications, driving innovation by focusing on building the right front-end and business logic to maximize the benefits of existing back-end services.

### Security Implications of API-Driven Architectures

While the benefits of API-driven architectures are significant, they also introduce major security challenges. Organizations now need to secure a constellation of web services, each a potential target for malicious actors. The convenience of automated access by design is a double-edged sword, providing attackers with more opportunities to craft and conduct large-scale attacks with less chance of detection. Combined with the risk of undocumented and inadequately secured endpoints, this makes APIs a fast-growing vector for cyberattacks, with consequences ranging from data breaches and denial of service to ransomware deployments.

### Building API Scanning into Your AppSec Program

Automated vulnerability scanning is essential for any mature Application Security (AppSec) program, especially in environments where web applications change frequently. To understand your true security posture, you need to scan your entire web attack surface, including both user interfaces (UIs) and APIs, in both development and production. APIs can change and expand much faster than user-facing interfaces, making purely manual testing impractical and emphasizing the need for efficient and accurate scanning.

Research shows that security often takes a back seat when release deadlines loom, and this is even more true for APIs. Whether due to perceived lower exposure or the difficulty and time required to find and test them, API security can easily be overlooked. This is especially problematic when a separate toolchain is needed for API security testing, increasing the risk that vulnerabilities will slip into production.

### Integrating API Testing into Your Development Lifecycle

Incorporating APIs into the overall AppSec testing strategy presents both technical and organizational challenges. To maximize test coverage without halting development pipelines, advanced tooling and a systematic approach to application security are necessary. Invicti addresses these challenges by providing vulnerability scanning support for popular API types, including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL. Users can import API definition files in industry-standard formats such as Postman, OpenAPI/Swagger, WADL, and WSDL. This ensures that as long as you have and maintain the definition files, your automated security testing process can cover both UIs and APIs during vulnerability scans.

### Ensuring Consistent Accuracy Across the Entire Application

To ensure consistent protection across your application, you need to apply the same security checks for API-based testing as for conventional testing. Invicti achieves this by consistently probing the entire attack surface using an integrated solution. By running high-quality tests on both interactive pages and API endpoints, you can eliminate weak spots in your overall security posture.

Automated testing requires a balance between finding vulnerabilities and minimizing false positives. Invicti's track record in automatic vulnerability confirmation helps to reduce the guesswork in dealing with application security reports. With over a thousand security checks, combined with cutting-edge technologies like Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), Invicti brings effective and practical application security testing into any modern web development workflow.

### Enforcing Authenticated Scanning

Authentication is a common challenge for automated security testing. Since most sensitive resources are not exposed to unauthenticated users, authenticated vulnerability scanning is crucial. All APIs require some form of authentication, and support for authenticated scanning is essential to allow the scanner to access API endpoints for testing. Invicti supports all popular authentication methods, from basic authentication to SSO with OAuth2, ensuring maximum test coverage and a realistic picture of your real-life security posture across all web-facing assets.

### Modern Applications Require Modern AppSec

If you have web applications, you also have web APIs, and both need to be secured to avoid weak links in your security posture. Manual testing was once the only way to check the API part of your web attack surface, but it cannot keep up with the pace of modern web development. With enterprise applications being built from numerous services or microservices communicating through APIs, extending automated vulnerability scanning to cover APIs was a logical next step for web application security. Invicti provides a single platform for comprehensive web application security testing, covering both visible and hidden parts of your web attack surface. This is integrated into your existing workflows without the need for additional toolchains or external security testing.
