I'm attempting to create windows nightlies, inspired by @ihnorton's recent
windows builds, and I'm running into the following error during the second
bootstrap phase with both 32 and 64-bit builds:
    ...
    meta.jl
    i18n.jl
    help.jl
    sparse.jl
    sparse/abstractsparse.jl
    matrixmarket.jl
    linalg.jl
    broadcast.jl
    fftw.jl
    dsp.jl
    rounding.jl
    gmp.jl

    quadgk.jl
    deprecated.jl
    git.jl
    pkg.jl
    graphics.jl
    profile.jl
    err:dbghelp_stabs:stabs_parse Unknown stab type 0x0a
    abnormal program termination
    *** This error is usually fixed by running 'make clean'. If the error persists, try 'make cleanall'. ***
    make[1]: *** [/home/sabae/tmp/julia-packaging/win32/julia-master/usr/bin/sys.ji] Error 1
    make: *** [release] Error 2
This is being done on a headless, 64-bit ubuntu 13.04 machine. I should point
out that because of the headless part, when I run the `make` process, I get
some warnings about not being able to open up an X window, so perhaps there is
some kind of configuration I need to do?
