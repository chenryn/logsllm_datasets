**Subject: Installing Plone 4.3.4 on SLES 11 SP3 64-bit Server**

I am attempting to install Plone 4.3.4 on a SLES 11 SP3 64-bit server using the Unified Installer. I have ensured that all dependencies listed in the `readme.txt` file are met. However, when I run the installer with the command:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh --password=******* standalone
```

I receive the following error message:

```
which: no python2.7 in (/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin)
Unable to find python2.7 on system exec path.
```

This is puzzling because, according to the Plone website, the Unified Installer should use its own copy of Python without replacing the system's Python. The relevant excerpt states:

> "The new Zope/Plone install will use its own copy of Python, and the Python installed by the Unified Installer will not replace your system's copy of Python. You may optionally use your system (or some other) Python, and the Unified Installer will use it without modifying it or your site libraries."

What could be causing this issue?

I also tried adding the `--build-python` parameter, but encountered another problem. The available `libxml2-devel` and `libxslt-devel` libraries for SLES 11 SP3 are outdated (versions 2.7.6 and 1.1.24, respectively), and the required versions are 2.7.8 and 1.1.26.

Is there a way to successfully install the current version of Plone on SLES 11 SP3 64-bit?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Kate

**Solution:**

To resolve the issue, the following command worked perfectly for me:

```bash
./install.sh standalone --build-python --static-lxml=yes
```

This command downloads and builds the necessary Python and `libxml2/libxslt` components, addressing the outdated and vulnerable versions included with SLES 11 SP3.

The system packages required for the build include:

- `gcc-c++`
- `make`
- `readline-devel`
- `libjpeg-devel`
- `zlib-devel`
- `patch`
- `libopenssl-devel`
- `libexpat-devel`
- `man`

These can be installed via `zypper`.

Additionally, I recommend avoiding the use of `sudo` for the installation. If you must use `sudo`, you will need to create the `plone_daemon` and `plone_buildout` users and the `plone_group` group in advance due to peculiarities in SUSE's `adduser` implementation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
