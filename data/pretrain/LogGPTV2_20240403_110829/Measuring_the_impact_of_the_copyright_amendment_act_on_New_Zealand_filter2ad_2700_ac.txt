### 4.2 Active Users
To assess whether the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act (CAA) had caused some subscribers to cease using P2P applications, we examined the number of active users for each application protocol. A subscriber was considered active if they either transmitted a packet containing application payload or received at least one megabyte of application payload from an external host. The second condition ensured that one-way passive FTP transactions, which do not require the recipient to transmit any data, were not excluded.

**Figure 4** shows the relative change in the number of subscribers actively using each application from the most prominent categories. Overall, the number of residential DSL subscribers decreased by 16% between January 2011 and January 2012. There is no clear reason for this decline. The number of subscribers using Web, Services, and Gaming traffic, which are largely unaffected by the CAA, also fell by a similar amount. In contrast, the number of subscribers using P2P protocols shrank significantly, halving between January 2011 and January 2012.

**Table 4** and **Figure 5** show the percentage of subscribers using certain application protocols and the average volume of traffic downloaded per day by a subscriber, respectively. BitTorrent was not widely used even before the CAA came into effect. Only 8.5% of subscribers actively used BitTorrent in January 2011. Following the enactment of the CAA, this value fell to 5.5% in September 2011 and further declined to 5.2% in January 2012. Additionally, the amount of traffic downloaded per BitTorrent user decreased from 126 MB per day per user in January 2011 to 81 MB in January 2012. This matches the behavior described in [10], where some French Internet users ceased using P2P altogether in response to the HADOPI law, while others reduced their downloading activities.

Remarkably, OpenVPN traffic per user increased from 600 KB per day in January 2011 to 116 MB per day in January 2012. It is possible that this increase is due to subscribers using OpenVPN to access seedboxes, although it is difficult to conclusively prove this with the available data. OpenVPN was only used by 0.3% of subscribers in January 2012, suggesting that the new usage of VPNs is restricted to a very small group of users. Other tunneling and file transfer protocols, such as FTP, ESP, and SSH, also exhibited an upward trend in the mean bytes downloaded per user, but the mean values were not as high as those observed for OpenVPN.

Teredo was another major contributor to the growth in tunneling usage. However, this is more likely due to the increased presence of IPv6 hosts providing content rather than P2P being tunneled over Teredo. The amount of Teredo traffic per active Teredo user was much less than what was observed for other tunneling protocols and did not demonstrate the same upward trend.

### 5. Conclusions
In this paper, we presented the results of a study investigating changes in traffic patterns and Internet user behavior following the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing) Amendment Act (CAA) 2011, which came into effect in New Zealand on September 1, 2011. We used libprotoident, an application protocol classification library, to analyze packet traces captured at a single New Zealand ISP both before and after the law came into effect. Specifically, we examined the number of residential DSL subscribers using each application protocol and the volumes of traffic downloaded and uploaded by those users.

Our main findings are summarized as follows:
- **P2P Traffic Decline**: Traffic downloaded using P2P applications decreased to less than half the volume it had been prior to the CAA coming into effect. The decline persisted for several months, and many subscribers appeared to have ceased using P2.P applications entirely.
- **P2P Uploads Decrease**: P2P uploads also decreased significantly following the introduction of the CAA. P2P traffic transmitted by DSL subscribers in January 2012 was a quarter of the amount transmitted in January 2011.
- **Increase in Tunneling and Remote Access Protocols**: FTP, tunneling, and remote access protocols increased in popularity following the introduction of the CAA. The relative growth in these protocols compared to January 2011 was very large, e.g., 300% more tunneling traffic was received by residential DSL subscribers in January 2012 compared to the previous year.
- **Limited Impact on Overall Behavior**: The number of active subscribers and traffic generated by tunneling, remote access, and FTP remained much smaller than the corresponding values for P2P, suggesting that the observed growth in those protocols was not indicative of a widespread change in file-sharing behavior.
- **Decline in Newsgroup Traffic**: Newsgroup traffic almost completely disappeared after the CAA came into effect, possibly suggesting that NNTP was being used almost exclusively for file sharing.

These results suggest a strong correlation between the CAA coming into effect and the behavior of New Zealand residential DSL users, at least in the short term. Many subscribers appear to have abandoned P2P file sharing entirely, while the remaining P2P users downloaded less content on a per-user basis than they had previously. Other application protocol categories related to file sharing, including newsgroups, encrypted traffic, and unclassified traffic, also experienced large declines in traffic volume.

Conversely, there was a distinct increase in the use of tunneling, secure file transfer, and remote access applications among a small group of subscribers. We believe that this may be due to users responding to the CAA by changing their approach to file sharing to limit the likelihood of being detected by copyright holders. Instead of running P2P applications at home, people can use seedboxes located outside of New Zealand to download copyrighted material and transfer the files back to their home computer using HTTPS or a secure tunnel. However, the decrease in P2P traffic observed in our study was much greater than the amount of new traffic that could be associated with tunneling and file transfers.

The results presented in this paper describe the behavior of subscribers from one New Zealand ISP only. Other ISPs may offer subscription plans and data caps that appeal more to people who download copyrighted material. For example, one ISP may be more popular with "heavy" P2P users because they sell a subscription plan with a high off-peak data cap, whereas another ISP may only sell plans targeting subscribers with small to medium data or bandwidth requirements. Although we believe that the subscriber base we measured is suitably representative, we acknowledge that this study represents a single data point when evaluating the overall impact of the CAA. A comparative analysis with other New Zealand and international ISPs would ascertain whether the behavior we highlighted is caused by the CAA rather than just strongly correlated.

Future work will involve continuing this study over a longer period. At the time of writing, only three people have received a third strike under the CAA, and the copyright holders elected not to take any of the cases to the Copyright Tribunal. Many copyright holders, particularly movie and television studios, are not willing to pay the processing fee for issuing notices, and the lack of enforcement of the CAA has been widely reported. As a result, it may prove that the decrease in P2P traffic we observed will only be temporary.
