to the proportion of traﬃc in the trace set that matched the protocol.
4.2 Active Users
We also examined the number of subscribers that were ac-
tively using each application protocol to assess whether the
CAA had caused some subscribers to cease using P2P appli-
cations altogether. We deﬁned a subscriber as actively using
a protocol if a ﬂow was observed where the subscriber had ei-
ther transmitted a packet containing application payload or
received at least one megabyte of application payload from
the external host. The second condition ensured that we did
not exclude one-way passive FTP transactions as these do
not require the recipient to transmit any data.
Figure 4 shows the relative change in the number of sub-
scribers actively using an application from each of the most
prominent categories. Overall, the number of residential
DSL subscribers decreased by 16% between January 2011
and January 2012. There is no obvious reason for this de-
cline. The number of subscribers using Web, Services and
Gaming traﬃc, i.e. categories that are largely unaﬀected by
the CAA, fell by a similar amount. By contrast, the number
of subscribers using P2P protocols shrank by a much greater
amount, halving between January 2011 and January 2012.
Table 4 and Figure 5 show the percentage of subscribers
that used certain application protocols and the average vol-
ume of traﬃc downloaded per day by a subscriber when us-
ing those protocols, respectively. BitTorrent was not widely
used even before the CAA came into eﬀect. Only 8.5% of
subscribers actively used BitTorrent in January 2011. Fol-
lowing the enactment of the CAA, this value fell to 5.5%
in September 2011 and declined further to 5.2% in January
2012. Also, the amount of traﬃc downloaded per BitTorrent
user also decreased from 126 MB per day per user in January
2011 to 81 MB in January 2012. This matches the behaviour
described in [10], where some French Internet users ceased
using P2P altogether in response to the HADOPI law while
others reduced their downloading activities.
Remarkably, OpenVPN traﬃc per user went from 600 KB
per day in January 2011 to 116 MB per day in January 2012.
It is possible that this is due to subscribers using OpenVPN
to access seedboxes, although it is diﬃcult to conclusively
prove this with the data that we have. OpenVPN was only
used by 0.3% of subscribers in January 2012 which suggests

that the new usage of VPNs is restricted to a very small
group of users. Other tunneling and ﬁle transfer protocols
that were more popular, such as FTP, ESP and SSH, also
exhibited an upward trend in the mean bytes downloaded
per user, but the mean values were not as high as those
observed for OpenVPN.
Teredo was another major contributor towards the growth
in Tunneling usage. However, this is more likely due to the
increased presence of IPv6 hosts providing content than P2P
being tunneled over Teredo. The amount of Teredo traﬃc
per active Teredo user was much less than what was observed
for other Tunneling protocols and did not demonstrate the
same upward trend.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we presented the results of a study inves-
tigating changes in traﬃc patterns and Internet user be-
haviour following the Copyright (Infringing File Sharing)
Amendment Act (CAA) 2011 which came into eﬀect in New
Zealand on 1 September 2011. We used libprotoident, an
application protocol classiﬁcation library, to analyse packet

sets. “Percentage” refers to the proportion of all active subscribers that used the protocol.
traces captured at a single New Zealand ISP both before and
after the law came into eﬀect. In particular, the number of
residential DSL subscribers that were using each applica-
tion protocol as well as the volumes of traﬃc downloaded
and uploaded by those users were examined.
Our main ﬁndings are summarised as follows:
• Traﬃc downloaded using P2P applications decreased to
less than half the volume it had been prior to the CAA
coming into eﬀect. The decline persisted for several months
afterward and many subscribers appeared to have ceased
using P2P applications entirely.
• P2P uploads also decreased signiﬁcantly following the in-
troduction of the CAA. P2P traﬃc transmitted by DSL
subscribers in January 2012 was a quarter of the amount
transmitted in January 2011.
• FTP, tunneling and remote access protocols increased in
popularity following the introduction of the CAA. The
relative growth in these protocols compared with January
2011 was very large, e.g. 300% more tunneling traﬃc was
received by residential DSL subscribers in January 2012
compared to the previous year.
• The number of active subscribers and traﬃc generated by
tunneling, remote access and FTP remained much smaller
than the corresponding values for P2P, suggesting that the
observed growth in those protocols was not indicative of
a widespread change in ﬁle sharing behaviour.
• Newsgroup traﬃc almost completely disappeared after the
CAA came into eﬀect, possibly suggesting that NNTP was
being used almost exclusively for ﬁle sharing.
These results suggest that there is a strong correlation be-
tween the CAA coming into eﬀect and the behaviour of New
Zealand residential DSL users, at least in the short term.
Many subscribers appear to have abandoned P2P ﬁle shar-
ing entirely while the remaining P2P users downloaded less
content on a per-user basis than they had previously. Other
application protocol categories that were related to ﬁle shar-
ing, including newsgroups, encrypted traﬃc and unclassiﬁed
traﬃc, also experienced large declines in traﬃc volume.
Conversely, there was a distinct increase in the use of tun-
neling, secure ﬁle transfer and remote access applications
amongst a small group of subscribers. We believe that this
may be due to users responding to the CAA by changing
their approach to ﬁle sharing to limit the likelihood of being
detected by copyright holders. Rather than running P2P
applications at home, people can use seedboxes located out-
side of New Zealand to download copyrighted material and
transfer the ﬁles back to their home computer using HTTPS
or a secure tunnel. However, we note that the decrease of
P2P traﬃc observed in our study was much greater than the
amount of new traﬃc that could be associated with tunnel-
ing and ﬁle transfers.
The results presented in this paper describe the behaviour
of subscribers from one New Zealand ISP only. Other ISPs
may oﬀer subscription plans and data caps which may ap-
peal more to the people who download copyrighted ma-
terial. For example, one ISP may be more popular with
“heavy” P2P users because they sell a subscription plan with
a high oﬀ-peak data cap, whereas another ISP may only sell
plans that target subscribers with small to medium data or
bandwidth requirements. Although we believe that the sub-
scriber base that we have measured is suitably representa-
tive, we also acknowledge that this study merely represents
a single data point when it comes to evaluating the impact
of the CAA overall. A comparative analysis with other New
Zealand and international ISPs would ascertain whether the
behaviour that we have highlighted is caused by the CAA
rather than just strongly correlated.
Another avenue of future work will involve continuing this
study over a longer period of time. At the time of writing,
only three people have received a third strike under the CAA
and the copyright holders elected not to take any of the
cases to the Copyright Tribunal. Many copyright holders
(in particular, movie and television studios) are not willing
to pay the processing fee for issuing notices and the lack of
enforcement of the CAA has been widely reported. As a
result, it may prove that the decrease in P2P traﬃc that we
have observed will only be temporary.
