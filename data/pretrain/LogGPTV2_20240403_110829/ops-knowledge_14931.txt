User: How to use Docker containerization technology to build a development and testing environment to achieve rapid building and deployment of applications?
Assistant: 1. Install Docker first. You can download the Docker installation package corresponding to the operating system from the official website. 2. Create a new container in Docker, either using a pre-configured Dockerfile or manually using Docker commands. 3. Package the application and dependencies as a Docker image and upload it to the registry. 4. Use the same image in different environments, such as development, testing, and production environments. 5. Use Docker containers as the standard unit of build and deployment in continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) processes. 6. Use Docker Compose to define and manage applications composed of multiple containers; use Kubernetes to automatically manage and orchestrate Docker containers. In this way, you can easily create, delete, and modify Docker containers, quickly build and deploy development and testing environments, and improve the efficiency of application development and deployment.
