##### Description of the problem
Currently when we want to change things inside a GLTF, for instance making
meshes drop shadows, material props, etc, we have to do messy deep traversals.
GLTF loader already returns scenes, cameras and assets, but looking though the
source it still knows about nodes and materials internally. If this could be
exposed it would be very efficient for us to make changes:
    new GLTFLoader().load(url, gltf => {
      gltf.materials["base"].roughness = 0.5
      gltf.nodes["plane"].castShadow = true
    })
i have made a tool for gltf-jsx exports that does something similar, and i've
started implementing the above variant in a test, it looks like this now:

would it be possible to add these two collections officially to the gltf
result?
