Extra slashes in the URL change the routing. For example, `/x` and `//x` do
not route the same way.  
Here's a unit test which demonstrates this:

If you put a proxy in front of flask, it will normalize the URLs so this isn't
an issue. It would seem, however, that Flask should normalize the URLs as
well.
