### Bug Report
#### Original Reporter: @slikts

#### Babel Version:
- **Version:** 6.7.7

#### Input Code:
```javascript
class Foo extends Array {}
```

#### Description:
Refer to the context provided [here](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/adding-a-non-class-syntax-method-for-subclassing-native-objects).

The `Reflect.construct()` method enables the invocation of the internal `[[Construct]]` method, which ensures that the constructed object inherits the complete behavior of exotic objects. Babel should utilize `Reflect.construct()` if it is available in the runtime environment. This approach would help maintain the full semantics of the `class extends` syntax, thereby allowing the inheritance of exotic object behaviors.
