### Bug information
  * **Babel version:** 6.7.7
### Input code
    class Foo extends Array {}
### Description
Context here: https://esdiscuss.org/topic/adding-a-non-class-syntax-method-
for-subclassing-native-objects
The `Reflect.construct()` method allows calling the internal `[[Construct]]`
method, which results in the constructed object inheriting the full behavior
of exotic objects; Babel should use `Reflect.construct()` if it exists in the
runtime to preserve the full semantics of the `class extends` syntax, which
allows inheriting the exotic object behavior.
