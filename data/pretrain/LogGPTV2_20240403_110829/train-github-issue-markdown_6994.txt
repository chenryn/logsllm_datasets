The mobx example does not work with jest configured(I use the .babelrc config
as in jest example).  
I believe there is problem with .babelrc configuration with env
So, if .babelrc config is same as jest then, tests run but mobx doesn't and
vice-versa.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
mobx store should run
## Current Behavior
mobx store does not work, the observable properties/ action setters and
getters does not work.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Use mobx example and change the babelrc config to the one with jest example
