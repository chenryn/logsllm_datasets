In conclusion, the simulated probabilities follow compara-
ble patterns with the model, and are in the same range. The
model derived herein thus serves as a formal means for evalu-
ating the efﬁcacy and suitability of UWB-ED in practice. The
results also show that the channel condition, such as path loss,
noise, and interference due to multipath components, does
not affect the performance and security of the system. An
adversary can increase the noise level, which can increase
false positives. High false positives may eventually cause
DoS (which the adversary can mount anyway by jamming
the channel), but the adversary remains unable to enlarge
distances.
6 Discussion
Adaptive attacks. An adversary can notice the effect of each
of its added pulses on the resultant energy, whether annihi-
lated or ampliﬁed. It can then adapt its attack strategy by
dynamically deciding k based on the number of pulses it has
added/annihilated so far during the transmission. The adver-
sary can then utilize its knowledge of n, α and β in order
to, not only decide the optimal value of k statically before
the transmission begins, but also adjust their distribution in
realtime. This attack does not succeed because the adversary
cannot control the resultant pulse phase. Injecting excessive
energy in Binβ exceeds Γ; injecting in Binα does not guaran-
tee annihilation because of the unpredictable phase.
Varying energy levels. To achieve perfect signal annihila-
tion, an adversary uses the same amplitude expected at the
receiver. Instead of injecting k pulses each with a constant en-
ergy of, e.g., 2µW , the adversary can inject one pulse with an
energy of, e.g., 2kµW . If all k pulses fell in Binβ, the aggregate
energy would be the same as when that single high-energy
pulse also falls in Binβ. However, intuitively, the adversary
is better off injecting multiple pulses with constant energies
for two reasons. First, multiple pulses in Binβ have higher
chances of being selected than a single pulse, thus evading
the Robust Code Veriﬁcation check. Second, for those that
fall in Binα, any leftover energy after annihilating a pulse,
regardless of the phase, will be counted towards the overall
aggregate, thus hurts the adversary’s cause.
Inﬂuencing Γ through distance shortening. Instead of
enlarging distances directly, the adversary can ﬁrst mount
a distance-reduction attack to trick the devices into using
higher Γ (recall: smaller signal attenuation due to shorter path
loss leads to higher Γ calibration). It is thus imperative to
complement UWB-ED with a distance-reduction detection [5,
6, 26]. Devices should alternate between both techniques;
e.g., if distances of d1 and d2 are veriﬁed using respectively
UWB-ED and a distance-reduction detection technique, it
should be concluded that the actual distance, d, is in the range
d1 ≤ d ≤ d2 (d1 is a lower bound, d2 an upper).
Inﬂuencing the number of pulses, n. An adversary can
inject a low stream of noise-like energy, not too high to be
detected as jamming. However because Γ is set beforehand,
it is not inﬂuenced by the adversary. By injecting noise, the
adversary actually hurts its own cause as it reduces the amount
of energy it can use strategically to prevent code detection.

series of physical layer improvements to provide secure and
precise ranging [2]. Those include additional coding, pream-
bles, and improvement to existing modulations to increase
ranging integrity and accuracy. UWB-ED is a potential can-
didate for enlargement detection in 802.15.4z. It adheres to
the low pulse repetition (LRF) mode frequency (1-2 MHz),
works with non-coherent receivers, and supports up to 100m.
The 3GPP technical speciﬁcations groups are designing
the 5G-new radio technology, and it aims to include secure
and precise ranging based on wireless signals [16,33]. Proper-
ties such as high carrier frequencies, large bandwidths, large
antenna arrays, device-to-device communication, and ultra-
dense networking will help attain this objective. It is early to
say the exact modulation techniques 5G will use for distance
measurement, but it is safe to assume that wideband will be
used to attain position accuracy; beamforming techniques will
achieve long distances. This system is equivalent to setting
r = 1 herein without restrictions on α, as transmission power
restrictions imposed on UWB do not apply to 5G. However,
the security of 5G can be increased further, as it allows for
the use of beamforming and coherent receivers.
8 Conclusion
We present UWB-ED—the ﬁrst known technique to detect
distance-enlargement attacks against standard UWB ranging
systems. UWB-ED is readily deployable for current off-the-
shelf receivers, requiring no additional infrastructure. Evalua-
tion is performed by deriving the probability of adversarial
success in mounting distance enlargement attacks. Results
show that the veriﬁcation code structure herein prevents signal
annihilation. The code also allows the use of longer symbol
length at the receiver, which is essential to achieve longer
distance in the energy constrained UWB system. UWB-ED is
thus a good candidate for enlargement detection in practice
(e.g., for 802.15.4z and 5G).

7 Related Work
Detecting enlargement attacks has lately been a prominent
research area. Previous literature explored timing acquisition
at the preamble, and data ambiguity at payload. Taponecco et
al. [27] show that the success of enlargement attacks using re-
play (or overshadowing) depends on the amount of delay the
adversary introduces. Such success is harder for controllable
attacks, where the adversary is required to position nodes at
speciﬁc locations. Compagno et al. [8] provide a probabilis-
tic model for the success of overshadowing attacks, which
captures different channel conditions and leading edge detec-
tion techniques for ToA estimation. None of the above efforts
considered adversarial signal annihilation.
Tippenhauer et al. [29] explored a theoretical approach to
detect adversarial signal annihilation for distance enlargement:
using a single pulse-per-symbol (consecutive integration win-
dows represent a symbol). They found that modulation with a
2ns slot size, i.e., mostly equivalent to a pulse width, might
help detect signal annihilation. This, however limits the rang-
ing technique to short distances. The effect of multipath on
that scheme in practice is also unclear, since reﬂected signals
would directly interfere with authentic ones causing distor-
tion (no empty gaps between authentic pulses). In contrast,
UWB-ED allows for increased distances by increasing the
symbol length, and the sampling time between consecutive
pulses is sufﬁcient to handle the multipath effect.
