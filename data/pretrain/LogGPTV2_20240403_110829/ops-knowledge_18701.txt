User: I started Django in Mac OS and after installing Django using pip, I tried to initiated a new project using the command django-admin startproject mysite. I get the error -bash: django-admin: command not found. I make quick search in Google and haven't get any solution that works. 
How to start a new project using Django using django-admin ?
Assistant: I know I'm jumping in a little late, but my installations seem to all reside away from /usr/local/bin/... . What worked for me was adding an export path in bash_profile for my django installation. 
This also made me realize that it was installed globally. From what I've heard, it's better to install django locally within venv as you work on different projects. That way each virtual environment can contain its own versions and dependencies for django (and whatever else you're using). Big thanks to @Arefe.
