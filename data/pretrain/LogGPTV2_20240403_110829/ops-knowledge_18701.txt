**User:**
I recently started working with Django on macOS. After installing Django using `pip`, I attempted to initiate a new project using the command `django-admin startproject mysite`. However, I encountered the following error: `-bash: django-admin: command not found`. I searched for solutions online but couldn't find one that worked.

How can I start a new Django project using `django-admin`?

**Assistant:**
I understand you're encountering an issue with the `django-admin` command not being recognized. This is likely due to the `django-admin` script not being in your system's PATH. Here’s how you can resolve this:

1. **Add Django to Your PATH:**
   You can add the path to the `django-admin` script to your system's PATH. This can be done by editing your `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc` if you are using Zsh) and adding the following line:
   ```sh
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/your/django-admin
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/django-admin` with the actual path where `django-admin` is installed. For a global installation, it might be something like `/usr/local/bin`.

2. **Using a Virtual Environment:**
   It's generally a good practice to use a virtual environment (venv) for each Django project. This isolates your project's dependencies and allows you to manage different versions of Django and other packages. Here’s how you can set up a virtual environment and install Django within it:

   - Install `virtualenv` if you haven’t already:
     ```sh
     pip install virtualenv
     ```

   - Create a new virtual environment in your project directory:
     ```sh
     virtualenv venv
     ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   - Install Django within the virtual environment:
     ```sh
     pip install django
     ```

   - Now, you should be able to use `django-admin` to create a new project:
     ```sh
     django-admin startproject mysite
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to start a new Django project without encountering the `command not found` error. Thank you to @Arefe for the helpful input!
