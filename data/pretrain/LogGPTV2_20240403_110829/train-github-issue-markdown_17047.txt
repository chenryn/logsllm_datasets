Here the gist:

In renderer process we have a simple button calling
`remote.dialog.showOpenDialog()`  
with a callback fn which just prints in console the filenames for the selected
images.
At some point callback fn ( callback for dialog.showOpenDialog() ) stops being
called. Lets say we repeat this process some times:
(with console opened)
  1. click btn (dialog opens)
  * "clicked!" is console-logged 
    1. select 1,5 or N number of images from X folder
    2. hit open
  * array length & array itself are console-logged 
    1. repeat #1
Do this for several times, then stop for a while, then try again.  
Not sure how or why but this reproduces the issue for me. At some point we
just get the "clicked!" console log and we stops receiving callback's console
logs.
P.D.: gist above is ready to run  
`npm install && npm start`
