# Analysis of Application Performance and API Call Durations

## 1. Introduction
This section analyzes the performance of several applications, focusing on the variation in response sizes, API call durations, and server load. The study also examines the impact of these factors on user experience.

## 2. Variation in Response Sizes
The average response size for the applications remains stable throughout the measurement period. The least popular application, "The Streets," has the smallest average response size (1.5–3 KB), while the most popular application, "Hugged," has the largest (4–5 KB). Contrary to expectations, there is no significant decrease in response sizes during periods of high request arrival rates, indicating that new application installation requests do not dominate these periods.

## 3. API Call Durations
### 3.1 Overview
The type of interactions (API calls) from third-party application servers to Online Social Networks (OSNs) significantly affects application server delays, impacting overall user experience. We studied the delay associated with making API calls from application servers to OSN servers, termed as the API call duration.

### 3.2 Distribution of API Call Durations
Figure 9 shows the distribution of API call durations for various applications. "The Streets" had the shortest call duration, followed by "Holiday Cheers," while "Hugged" had the longest.

### 3.3 Impact of Server Load on API Call Duration
To understand the role of API calls, we analyzed how the API call duration is affected by server load for two popular applications: "Hugged" and "Holiday Cheers."

- **Holiday Cheers**: The average API call duration remains fairly stable over time (Figure 11).
- **Hugged**: The API call duration shows a significant increase during peak activity periods (Figure 10).

### 3.4 Comparison of API Calls
We compared the specific types of API calls made by "Hugged" and "Holiday Cheers." Both applications make several similar API calls, but "Hugged" makes a few additional API calls (Type A) that are not made by "Holiday Cheers" (Type B).

- **Type A Calls**: These additional calls were responsible for the surge in average API delays during high load.
- **Type B Calls**: Even these common calls show greater variation with load for "Hugged" compared to "Holiday Cheers."

We suspect this is due to per-application or per-API-call resource budgets at the OSN, which are fully consumed by the higher load for "Hugged" during peak traffic periods.

## 4. Concluding Remarks
Based on our observations, we conclude that one does not need exorbitant resources to launch and maintain an extremely popular OSN application, despite its viral growth and/or large fluctuations in seasonal usage. In our case study, a server with a Dual Core Xeon 2.0GHz, 4-8GB Memory, and 100 Mbps connection speed is sufficient to serve extremely popular applications like "Hugged" or "Holiday Cheers" that attract 100-200K Daily Active Users (DAU).

## 5. Gauging Facebook Internals
After examining results from the perspective of the application servers, we now turn to characterizing delay components from the end-user's perspective. This is motivated by the question: Do OSNs such as Facebook introduce significant delay overhead to impact user experience while interacting with third-party applications? If so, what factors influence these delays?

### 5.1 Extracting OSN Delays
Section 3 outlines the two types of delays involved when a client interacts with an OSN to access third-party applications:
- **OSN Request Forwarding Delay (𝑑𝑓)**: The delay in forwarding the request from the client to the application server.
- **OSN Response Processing Delay (𝑑𝑔)**: The delay in processing the response from the application server to the client.

Our experiments involve a diverse set of PlanetLab (PL) nodes representing the clients. Our data shows that client requests generated in our PL experiments were forwarded by Facebook to the application servers from 27 distinct IP addresses, all located in California. The average Round-Trip Time (RTT) was around 170ms, with nodes farther away geographically having higher RTTs.

Experiments from nodes in different countries showed similar 𝑑𝑓 and 𝑑𝑔 values (with differences of less than 10ms on average for the same experiment). However, outliers in Armenia, India, and China consistently registered larger OSN delays, mainly due to differences in CPU power and loads on these nodes.

### 5.2 OSN Request Forwarding Delays
Facebook, as the intermediary, must ensure that users' requests are forwarded to the application servers in a timely manner. Key observations include:

- **OSN Request Forwarding Delays (𝑑𝑓)**: For user requests of size 0–1KB (typical for the six chosen Facebook applications), the forwarding delay is around 130ms. Figure 12 shows how 𝑑𝑓 varies with request size. The minimum 𝑑𝑓 (for a 0KB request size) was about 130ms, while requests of size 50KB took 550–650ms to leave Facebook.

By analyzing these factors, we can better understand the performance and user experience of third-party applications on OSNs like Facebook.
