User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows multiple authentication failures for user root from the same host, as well as the opening and closing of sessions for users cyrus and news. Additionally, there were multiple attempts to open a session for user test, but all were closed shortly after.
