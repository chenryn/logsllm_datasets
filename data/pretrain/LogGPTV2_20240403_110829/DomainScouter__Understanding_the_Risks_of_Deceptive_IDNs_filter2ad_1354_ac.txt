### Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks

These websites often attempt to obtain sensitive information, such as user IDs and passwords, through phishing or social engineering attacks. Notably, DOMAINSCOUTER successfully detected a significant number of eng-combo and eng-homocombo Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) that were defined for the first time in this paper. For instance, Amazon was the most targeted brand, with 56 eng-combo IDNs, 64 eng-homo IDNs, and 843 eng-homocombo IDNs.

### Top 10 Most Targeted Non-English Brands

Table 6 lists the 10 most targeted non-English brands, along with their Alexa rankings and English meanings. The results confirm the existence of many noneng-combo and noneng-homocombo IDNs, which are also defined and studied for the first time in this paper. Among the top 10 brands, only one had noneng-combo IDNs. We found numerous noneng-homocombo IDNs targeting place names (e.g., Austria, Pattaya, and Antalya) and common words (e.g., sport, flights, and weather) in non-English languages.

| Target | Alexa Rank | English Meaning | noneng-combo | noneng-homocombo | Total |
|--------|------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Austria | 487,222    | Austria         | 1,032         | 1,032             | 2,064 |

### Creation Dates of Deceptive IDNs

We examined the registration dates of the detected deceptive IDNs using the WHOIS database, as explained in Section 3.1. Due to some limitations in the WHOIS dataset, we were able to extract the registration dates for only 62% (5,176 out of 8,284) of the detected deceptive IDNs. Figure 3 illustrates the number of deceptive IDNs registered each year by type. The results show two key trends: the number of deceptive IDNs increases annually, and many newly defined types (e.g., eng-combo, eng-homocombo, noneng-combo, and noneng-homocombo) were registered after 2014.

### Impacts of Deceptive IDNs

#### Accesses

To understand the impact of the detected deceptive IDNs, we analyzed the number of DNS queries to these domains over time using the passive DNS database (DNSDB), covering the period from June 24, 2010, to September 19, 2018. Table 7 lists the total number of DNS queries for each type of deceptive IDN. For example, 1,547 eng-homo IDNs targeting English brands were queried over 1 million times in total, while 2,528 noneng-homocombo IDNs targeting non-English brands were queried over 1.4 million times. These results indicate that all types of deceptive IDNs have accumulated a significant number of accesses over time.

| Type                | Sum of Queries | # Deceptive IDNs |
|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| eng-combo           | 226,546        | 368              |
| eng-homo            | 1,019,613      | 1,547            |
| eng-homocombo       | 737,696        | 3,697            |
| noneng-combo        | 317,043        | 144              |
| noneng-homocombo    | 1,440,388      | 2,528            |
| Total               | 3,741,286      | 8,284            |

#### Lifetime

Next, we analyzed the lifetime of the detected deceptive IDNs, defined as the period from the first-seen to the last-seen DNS queries based on the DNSDB data. We used survival analysis with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, a common method in cybersecurity. Figure 4 shows the results, indicating that eng-combo, eng-homo, and eng-homocombo IDNs have a shorter survival probability compared to noneng-combo and noneng-homocombo IDNs.

### Brand Protection

We investigated the extent to which the detected deceptive IDNs are protected by their legitimate domain owners. Using the WHOIS dataset, we identified whether a deceptive IDN is protected if both the registrant emails of the deceptive IDN and the targeted brand domain match. This process has limitations, such as when email addresses are not properly extracted or when privacy protection services are used.

Only 3.8% (316 out of 8,284) of the detected deceptive IDNs were protected by their targeted brand owners. Table 8 lists the top 10 protected brands, including their Alexa ranks, the number of protected deceptive IDNs, the total number of detected deceptive IDNs, and the protective ratio. Notably, no brand in the top 10 or among the world's most popular internet companies protected themselves from all corresponding deceptive IDNs. However, companies offering internet security services, such as Cloudflare and Symantec, had higher protective ratios.

| Brand Domain        | Alexa Rank | # Protected | # Detected | Protective Ratio |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|------------|------------------|
| amazon[.]com        | 10         | 42          | 963        | 4.4%             |
| google[.]com        | 1          | 35          | 236        | 14.8%            |

| cloudflare[.]com    | 256        | 14          | 16         | 87.5%            |
| youtube[.]com       | 2          | 14          | 121        | 11.6%            |

### User Study

The attacks using deceptive IDNs target users' perceptions. We conducted two online surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to examine users' knowledge of IDNs and their susceptibility to deceptive IDNs. Both surveys were approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB) and limited to U.S. residents with an approval rating over 97% and more than 50 tasks approved. The surveys were conducted in November 2018.

#### User Study 1

This survey aimed to gather participants' demographics and knowledge of IDNs. It consisted of 12 closed-ended questions, including a multiple-choice question about the characters used in domain names. The options included various languages and symbols, except punctuation.

**Results:**
- Only 5.5% (20 out of 364) of the participants correctly identified all valid characters.
- Only 11.3% (41 out of 364) showed some knowledge of IDNs.
- Surprisingly, only 13.5% of computer engineers or IT professionals answered correctly.

In summary, the majority of participants, even those in IT-related fields, lacked sufficient knowledge about IDNs.

#### User Study 2

This survey aimed to measure how many users are deceived by attacks using deceptive IDNs. It consisted of 18 closed-ended questions about demographics and visual perception of deceptive IDNs.

**Method:**
- We prepared 70 actual deceptive IDNs for seven popular brands: Google, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Instagram, and PayPal.
- For each brand, we included five high-scoring deceptive IDNs (score of 1.0) and five low-scoring deceptive IDNs (scores ranging from 0.06 to 0.56).

The results of these studies will help stakeholders develop more practical countermeasures against deceptive IDNs.
