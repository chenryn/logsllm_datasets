these websites to obtain sensitive information such as user
IDs and passwords via phishing or social engineering attacks.
Finally, DOMAINSCOUTER successfully detected many eng-
combo and eng-homocombo IDNs that were deﬁned in this
paper for the ﬁrst time. For example, we found that Amazon
was targeted the most (56 eng-combo IDNs, 64 eng-homo
IDNs, and 843 eng-homocombo IDNs).
Table 6 lists the 10 most targeted non-English brands, along
with their Alexa rankings and English meanings. The result
proves the existence of many noneng-combo and noneng-
homocombo IDNs that are deﬁned and studied in this paper
for the ﬁrst time. Noneng-combo IDNs were found for only
one target brand in the top 10 brands. We found many noneng-
homocombo IDNs that targeted place names (e.g., Austria,
Pattaya, and Antalya) and common words (e.g., sport, ﬂights,
and weather) in non-English languages.
Creation Dates. We examined when the detected deceptive
IDNs were registered and started to be used. To this end,
we leveraged the WHOIS database [64] explained in Sec-
tion 3.1. From the WHOIS database, we extracted the dates

Figure 3: Number of Detected Deceptive IDNs
of registration corresponding to deceptive IDNs. Due to some
limitations of the WHOIS dataset (e.g., dates of registration
were not provided in some registries), we were able to ex-
tract the dates for only 62% (=5,176 / 8,284) of the detected
deceptive IDNs.
Figure 3 illustrates the number of deceptive IDNs in each
year by the deceptive type. The results revealed two major
facts about deceptive IDNs. First, the number of deceptive
IDNs increases year by year. Second, many deceptive IDNs
that are newly deﬁned in this paper (e.g., eng-combo, eng-
homocombo, noneng-combo, and noneng-homocombo) were
registered after 2014.
5.2 Impacts of Deceptive IDNs
Accesses. To understand the impacts of the detected deceptive
IDNs, we investigate how many accesses or queries to the
detected deceptive IDNs were observed over time. To this end,
we leveraged the passive DNS database (DNSDB) [13] cov-
ering the period from 6-24-2010 to 9-19-2018. The DNSDB
enabled us to investigate statistics of DNS queries to the de-
ceptive IDNs such as the dates of ﬁrst- and last-seen queries
and the number of queries. Note that, because the provider
could not identify speciﬁc users from aggregated DNS queries,
the DNSDB data inevitably counted queries from victims, at-
tackers, and security researchers. Table 7 lists the total number
of DNS queries to each type of deceptive IDNs. For the de-
ceptive IDNs targeting English brands, 1,547 eng-homo IDNs
were queried over 1 million times in total. For those targeting
non-English brands, 2,528 noneng-homocombo IDNs were

Lifetime. Next, we focus on the lifetime of the detected de-
ceptive IDNs. In this paper, we deﬁne the lifetime of deceptive
IDNs as the period from the ﬁrst-seen to the last-seen DNS
queries on the basis of the DNSDB data. To analyze the
lifetime, we used a survival analysis based on the Kaplan-
Meier estimator [28], commonly used to estimate lifespan
in cyber security [15, 33, 42]. Figure 4 shows the results of
the survival analysis. The x-axis is the lifetime (in days),
while the y-axis shows the survival probability, meaning the
probability that the deceptive IDN remains after the elapsed
number of days. From the ﬁgure, we can see that the charac-
teristics of the deceptive IDNs targeting English brands and
those targeting non-English brands are different. In particu-
lar, eng-combo, eng-homo, and eng-homocombo IDNs have
shorter survival probability than noneng-combo and noneng-
homocombo IDNs.
5.3 Brand Protection
So far, we have shed light on the characteristics of the detected
deceptive IDNs overall. This section focuses on the decep-
tive IDNs that are now protected by their legitimate domain
owners or rightsholders. In particular, we investigated each
detected deceptive IDN to identify whether it is protected by
its targeted brand’s owner. To this end, we used the WHOIS
dataset to extract registrant emails of both the deceptive IDN
and the targeted brand domain. In this work, a deceptive IDN
is considered to be protected if both emails are the same and
the domain part of the email (e.g., @example[.]com) is identi-
cal to the targeted brand domain (e.g., example[.]com). This
identiﬁcation process has two limitations. One is the process
does not work when an email address is not properly extracted
from the WHOIS dataset. The other is the process cannot
properly identify a protected deceptive IDN if the legitimate

domain owner uses different email addresses for the brand
domain and its deceptive IDN, or if the owner uses a WHOIS
privacy protection service to hide their email addresses.
Using the above identiﬁcation processes, we revealed that
only 3.8% (=316 / 8,284) of the detected deceptive IDNs were
protected by their targeted brand owners. Table 8 lists the top
10 protected brands; it contains the Alexa rank, the number
of protected deceptive IDNs, the number of all detected de-
ceptive IDNs, and the protective ratio. From the table, one
can derive two noteworthy facts regarding brand protection.
One is no brand domain in the top 10 or the world’s most
popular Internet companies protected themselves from all of
its corresponding detected deceptive IDNs. This strongly in-
dicated that the deceptive IDN problem is difﬁcult for one
company to solve by itself. The other fact is only the few
companies offering Internet security services (e.g., Cloudﬂare
and Symantec) protected themselves from the deceptive IDNs
more than other companies did.
6 User Study
The attacks that use deceptive IDNs target the perceptions
of the users accessing websites. In this section, we examine
whether the deceptive IDN score we proposed reﬂects the ten-
dency of users to be deceived by the attacks. Understanding
the impact of the attacks on users helps stakeholders to discuss
more practical countermeasures. We conducted two separate
online surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk): User
Study 1 to investigate users’ knowledge of IDNs, and User
Study 2 to examine the extent to which users are deceived
by deceptive IDNs. Our Institutional Review Board (IRB)
approved both surveys. Participants were limited to U.S. res-
idents with an approval rating over 97% and more than 50
tasks approved. We conducted these surveys in November
2018.
6.1 User Study 1
The ﬁrst survey was designed to ask participants about their
demographics and knowledge of IDNs.
Method. The survey consisted of 12 closed-ended questions.
We asked the participants about the characters used in domain
names. This was a multiple-choice question with the follow-
ing options: English (Upper case), English (Lower case), digit,
hyphen, punctuation, Cyrillic, Greek, Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean. IDNs can contain all these characters except for punc-
tuation.

The median time to complete the survey was 3.2 minutes,
and we compensated the participants $0.50 each. After remov-
ing 15 participants who gave incomplete or careless answers,
we analyzed the remaining 364 participants. 61.0% of the par-
ticipants were male, and their ages ranged from 19 to 71, with
a median of 33 (mean 36.3). Our sample had a wide range of
education levels (from high school to graduate degree) and
various occupations.
Results. Each language other than English was selected by
only one-fourth of the participants at most, whereas English,
hyphen, and digit were selected by over a half of the partici-
pants. As shown in Table 9, a small number, only 5.5% (=20 /
364), of the participants knew enough about IDNs (i.e., they
selected all choices except for punctuation). Only 11.3% (=41
/ 364) of the participants seemed to have some knowledge
about IDNs, i.e., they selected some languages other than En-
glish and did not select punctuation. Surprisingly, only 13.5%
of the computer engineers or IT professionals answered the
question correctly.
In summary, the majority of the participants did not know
enough about IDNs, even those engaged in IT-related occupa-
tions.
6.2 User Study 2
In the second survey, we aimed to examine the extent to which
users are deceived by attacks employing deceptive IDNs.
Method. The survey consisted of 18 closed-ended questions
regarding users’ demographics and visual perception of de-
ceptive IDNs.
To measure how many users are not aware of the deceptive
IDNs that disguise domains of popular online services, we
prepared 70 actual deceptive IDNs for seven popular brands
(online services): Google, YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, Twit-
ter, Instagram, and PayPal. We prepared ﬁve high-scoring
deceptive IDNs (with the score of 1.0) and ﬁve low-scoring
deceptive IDNs (with the scores ranging from 0.06 to 0.56)
for each target brand.
