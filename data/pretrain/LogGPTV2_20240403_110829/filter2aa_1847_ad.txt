### Effective Methods to Guard Against DNS Attacks

The most effective method to guard against DNS attacks is maintaining a high level of vigilance. This includes keeping your software up-to-date and regularly auditing your DNS records. As new exploits are discovered in the current version of BIND, patches are released, and security updates are made available for Mac OS X Server. It is crucial to apply all such security patches. Regular audits of your DNS records are also valuable in preventing these attacks.

### Server Mining

Server mining is a technique where an attacker obtains a complete copy of a master zone by requesting a zone transfer. In this scenario, the hacker pretends to be a slave zone to another master zone and requests a copy of all the master zone’s records.

With a copy of your master zone, the hacker can identify the types of services offered by a domain and the IP addresses of the servers that provide them. This information can then be used to launch specific attacks, making server mining a form of reconnaissance before a more targeted attack.

**Defensive Measures:**
- **Specify Allowed IP Addresses:** Only allow specific IP addresses (your slave zone servers) to request zone transfers and block all others. Zone transfers are conducted over TCP on port 53.
- **Firewall Configuration:**
  - Create a firewall filter that allows only IP addresses inside your firewall to access TCP port 53.
  - Follow the instructions in “Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP ports” in Chapter 3, “IP Firewall Service.”
  - Use the following settings:
    - Allow packet.
    - Port 53.
    - TCP protocol.
    - Source IP: IP address of your slave DNS server.
    - Destination IP: IP address of your master DNS server.

### DNS Service Profiling

Another common reconnaissance technique is DNS service profiling. A hacker sends a BIND version request, and the server responds with the version of BIND running. The hacker then compares the response to known exploits and vulnerabilities for that version of BIND.

**Defensive Measures:**
- **Alter BIND’s Version Response:**
  1. Launch a command-line text editor (e.g., vi, emacs, or pico).
  2. Open `named.conf` for editing.
  3. Add the following line within the `options` section:
     ```plaintext
     version "[your text, maybe ‘we're not telling!’]";
     ```
  4. Save the configuration file.

### Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks are common and relatively easy to execute. The attacker floods the server with so many service requests and queries that it uses all its processing power and network bandwidth, preventing legitimate use of the service.

**Defensive Measures:**
- **Monitoring and Early Detection:** Constant monitoring of the DNS service and server load allows administrators to catch the attack early and mitigate its effects.
- **Blocking Offending IP Addresses:** Use your firewall to block the offending IP address. See “Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP ports” on page 51. Note that this means the attack is already underway and the hacker’s queries are being answered and logged.

### Service Piggybacking

This type of attack is often performed by regular Internet users rather than hackers. Users may feel that their DNS response time with their own ISP is too slow and configure their computers to query another DNS server instead. This results in more users accessing the DNS server than planned.

**Defensive Measures:**
- **Limit or Disable DNS Recursion:**
  - If you offer DNS service to your LAN users, they need recursion to resolve domain names, but you don’t want to provide this service to external users.
  - To prevent recursion entirely, see “Enabling or Disabling Recursion” on page 21.
  - The most common approach is to allow recursion for requests from IP addresses within your own range and deny it to external addresses. Edit your `named.conf` file to include:
    ```plaintext
    options {
        ...
        allow-recursion {
            127.0.0.0/8;
            [your internal IP range of addresses, like 192.168.1.0/27];
        };
    };
    ```

### Common Network Administration Tasks Using DNS Service

#### Setting Up MX Records

If you plan to provide mail service on your network, you must set up DNS so that incoming mail is sent to the appropriate mail host. When setting up mail service, define a series of hosts (mail exchangers or MX hosts) with different priorities. The host with the highest priority gets the mail first. If that host is unavailable, the next highest priority host receives the mail, and so on.

**Example:**
- Mail server host name: `reliable.example.com`
- Without an MX record, user mail addresses would include the mail server computer name, e.g., `user@reliable.example.com`.
- To change the mail server or redirect mail, create an MX record for each domain handled by your mail server and direct the mail to the correct computer.

**Sample MX Record List:**
```plaintext
example.com
10 reliable.example.com
20 our-backup.example.com
30 last-resort.example.com
```

MX records are also used for outgoing mail. Your mail server checks the destination's MX records to determine if the destination is local or elsewhere on the Internet.

**Note:** If MX information is not entered correctly into your DNS server, mail will not work.

#### Configuring DNS for Mail Service

To enable Mail Exchange (MX) records with your own DNS server:
1. In Server Admin, choose DNS in the Computers & Services list.
2. Click Settings.
3. Select the Zones tab.
4. Select the Zone you want to use.
5. Click the Add button under the Records pane.
6. Choose MX from the Type pop-up menu.
7. Enter the domain name (e.g., `example.com.`) in the From field.
8. Enter the name of the mail server (e.g., `mail.example.com.`) in the To field.
9. Enter a precedence number.
10. Click OK.

#### Enabling Redundant Mail Servers

To set up multiple servers for redundancy:
1. **Edit the MX record of the primary mail server:**
   - In Server Admin, choose DNS in the Computers & Services list.
   - Click Settings.
   - Select the Zones tab.
   - Select the Zone you want to use.
   - Click the primary mail server’s MX record in the Records pane.
   - Click the Edit button below the Records pane.
   - Enter a low precedence number for that server (lower number indicates it will be chosen first).
   - Click OK.
2. **Create records and priorities for the auxiliary mail servers:**
   - In Server Admin, select DNS in the Computers & Services pane.
   - Click Settings.
   - Select the Zones tab.
   - Select the Zone you want to use.
   - Click the Add button under the Records pane.
   - Choose MX from the Type pop-up menu.
   - Enter the domain name (e.g., `example.com.`) in the From field.
   - Enter the name of the mail server (e.g., `backup.example.com.`) in the To field.
   - Enter a precedence number higher than that of the primary server.
   - Click OK.

#### Setting Up Namespace Behind a NAT Router

If you are behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) router, you have a special set of IP addresses usable only within the NAT environment. Assigning domain names to these addresses outside the NAT router will not resolve to the correct computer. However, you can run a DNS service behind the router, assigning host names to the NAT IP addresses. This way, users behind the NAT router can enter domain names instead of IP addresses to access servers, services, and workstations.

**Steps:**
- Set up a DNS service behind the router.
- Configure a Forwarding zone to send DNS requests outside the NAT router.
- Specify the DNS server behind the NAT router in clients' networking settings.

For more information on NAT and port forwarding, see Chapter 4, “NAT Service,” on page 67.

#### Network Load Distribution (Round Robin)

BIND supports simple load distribution using round robin. You set up a pool of IP addresses for several hosts mirroring the same content, and BIND cycles the order of these addresses as it responds to queries. Round robin does not monitor current server load; it simply cycles the order of an address list.

**Example:**
- Suppose you want to distribute web server traffic between three servers with IP addresses 192.168.12.12, 192.168.12.13, and 192.168.12.14.
- Add the following lines to the zone data file `db.example.com`:
  ```plaintext
  www.example.com 60 IN A 192.168.12.12
  www.example.com 60 IN A 192.168.12.13
  www.example.com 60 IN A 192.168.12.14
  ```

When BIND encounters multiple entries for one host, it answers queries by cycling the list in order. The first request gets the addresses in the order A, B, C. The next request gets the order B, C, A, then C, A, B, and so on.

#### Setting Up a Private TCP/IP Network

If you have a local area network (LAN) that is not connected to the Internet, you can set up a private TCP/IP network using reserved IP address blocks:
- 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)
- 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)
- 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

You can also provide DNS service on your private network, allowing users to easily access file, web, mail, and other services.

#### Hosting Several Internet Services with a Single IP Address

If you have one server providing multiple Internet services (e.g., mail, web, FTP), you can set up DNS records to resolve multiple domain names to the same IP address. For example, `www.example.com`, `ftp.example.com`, and `mail.example.com` can all resolve to the same IP address.

**Steps:**
- Set up MX records for mail.
- Set up A records for each service provided by the server.
- Update DNS records as needed when adding more computers to the network.

#### Configuring BIND Using the Command Line

To configure BIND using the command line, you must be comfortable with UNIX commands and text editors. Ensure you have a thorough understanding of DNS and BIND before making changes.

**What Is BIND?**
- BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is a widely used open-source DNS server.
- Mac OS X Server uses BIND version 9.2.2.
- You can start and stop DNS service using the Server Admin application.

**BIND Configuration Files:**
- **named.conf:** The main configuration file located in `/etc`.
- **Zone Data Files:** Located in `/var/named/` and consist of address files and reverse lookup files.

**Practical Example:**
- Sample files can be found in `/usr/share/named/examples`.
- Assume a domain name of `example.com` behind the NAT.
- Steps to set up sample configuration files:
  1. Log in as root in Terminal.
  2. Save a copy of the process configuration file:
     ```bash
     cp /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.OLD
     ```
  3. Copy the sample file for the NAT zone:
     ```bash
     cp /usr/share/named/examples/db.10.0.1.sample /var/named/10.0.1.zone
     ```
  4. Copy the sample file for your domain:
     ```bash
     cp /usr/share/named/examples/example.com.sample /var/named/example.com.zone
     ```
  5. Copy in a sample named process configuration file:
     ```bash
     cp /usr/share/named/examples/named.conf.sample /etc/named.conf
     ```
  6. Edit `/etc/named.conf` using a command-line text editor.
  7. Apply edits appropriate to your installation.
  8. Save your changes to `named.conf`.
  9. Start DNS service using Server Admin.
  10. Change the domain name servers in the Network pane of System Preferences to list only the new DNS server's IP address, e.g., 10.0.1.2.

**Configuring Clients:**
- If client IP addresses are statically assigned, change the domain name servers in their Network preference panes to list only the new server’s IP address.
