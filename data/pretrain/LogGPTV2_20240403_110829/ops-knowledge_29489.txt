User: How to strengthen the security of the server, including port opening, user permission setting, firewall configuration, etc.?
Assistant: The following are suggestions for server security hardening: 1. Manage user rights: delete unnecessary user accounts or disable unnecessary accounts that may pose security threats, and set strong passwords for each account and change passwords regularly. 2. Prohibit unnecessary services: Disable useless services or applications, such as file sharing, remote desktop and Telnet, etc., to prevent attackers from attacking the system. 3. Port management: close or block unnecessary ports to prevent unauthorized access. Only open the necessary ports, restrict access to the server, and improve the security of the server. 4. Firewall configuration: Use a firewall to restrict external access to the system, detect and prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks in a timely manner. 5. Security updates and patches: Regularly detect and update any security holes and patches in the server system to keep the system up-to-date and improve system security. 6. Log monitoring: Log monitoring and event management are performed on the server, and on the basis of timely discovery of security events and abnormal behaviors, corresponding security measures are taken to ensure the security of the server. 7. Encrypted transmission: Encrypted transmission of communications containing sensitive data, such as communications between servers, remote management and user authentication, to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. 8. Backup management: Regularly back up key server data to prevent data loss and irrecoverable data, thus ensuring that the server actively responds to any attack.
