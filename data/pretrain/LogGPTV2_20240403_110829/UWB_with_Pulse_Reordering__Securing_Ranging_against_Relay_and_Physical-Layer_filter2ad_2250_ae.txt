mum distance decrease goes up to 2461.6m in this noncoherent
scenario 802.15.4a (NC). This kind of attack represents a
fundamental limitation of any noncoherent PPM/BPM system
and its success is independent of the shape and duration of the
pulse burst. Both results are listed in Table II, where they are
compared to the distance decrease possible under UWB-PR.
Irrespective of the conﬁguration chosen in 802.15.4a, higher
symbol energy comes at the cost of longer symbol duration
which is, in turn, associated with higher distance decreases in
a noncoherent setting. This behavior is compared to UWB-PR
in Figure 13.
We can summarise our insights as follows. With crypto-
graphic reordering and blinding missing,
the deterministic
time-coding of 802.15.4a and 802.15.4f make both approaches
vulnerable to ED/LC attacks. In 802.15.4f, we ﬁnd a modu-

lation scheme that provides atomic building blocks that can
be effectively interleaved for security. That is why UWB-PR
builds on 802.15.4f and introduces reordering of pulses among
bit-wise time intervals in order to gain resistance against all
physical-layer attacks, including ED/LC attacks. An overview
of these considerations is provided in Table III.
B. Limitations
UWB-PR prevents all physical-layer attacks that would
allow an attacker to decrease the distance between the veriﬁer
and trusted prover (Relay Attack, Maﬁa Fraud). However,
UWB-PR as such does not help against a malicious prover
aiming to reduce the distance measured (Distance Fraud). An
attacker that knows the reordering and XOR sequence cannot
be prevented from transmitting the reply early. This attacker
can send the appropriate response nP R as soon as it has
observed at least one pulse of each bit in nV E.
However, the reordering operation could also be a vital part
of a solution to this problem. We argue that distance fraud
could be prevented by keeping the reordering secret from the
prover. The prover would then intermingle its nonce with the
veriﬁer’s challenge purely on the physical layer, for example
by adding the nP R signal onto the received nV E signal before
transmitting the combined signal back. Precise time alignment
is guaranteed by the preamble and serves to convince the
veriﬁer that the secret challenge was actually handled by the
prover. Because the reordering is not known to the prover, it is
not able to decode the challenge. As a consequence, the early
inference of the challenge bit sequence nV E can be prevented.
IX. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented UWB-PR, a modulation scheme
that secures ranging against all physical-layer attacks that

security guarantees without making any assumptions regarding
channel conditions or attacker positions. We showed that
UWB-PR is unique compared to existing UWB systems in
that it allows long-distance ranging without compromising on
security. Measurements obtained with a prototype implemen-
tation of UWB-PR were aligned with that ﬁnding.

APPENDIX
To understand the impact of the reordering on attack suc-
cess, we analyze a particular instance of UWB-PR. The idea
is to determine the probability of attack success for different
numbers of bits reordered under the multi-power attacker
model and an optimal attack termination-point.
Reordering Process: Instead of reordering all pulses ran-
domly, we follow a speciﬁc process. We create NP subsets,
and each subset has NB pulses, where NP is the number of
pulses per symbol and NB the number of bits reordered. The
NB pulses of each subset belong to exactly NB different bits.
However, each subset hides the mapping differently, by using
a different reordering and XOR sequence. Figure 14 shows an
example of this reordering process.
Attack Strategy: The attacker is aware of the statistical
distribution, i.e., NB and NP , and knows that each pulse of
the subset belongs to the different bit. This knowledge gives
a bias to the attacker, even towards the end of the attack,
the attacker has a non-zero probability of producing a positive
contribution on each bit. However, he doesn’t know reordering
and XOR sequence applied on the subset. To maximize the
likelihood of positive net power per bit, an attacker needs to
decide energy levels for the attack on each pulse and the point
Fig. 14. Example for a Structured Reordering: There are NP subsets, and
each subset has NB pulses. Each pulse of a subset belongs to a different bit,
as is shown by reorderings R1 and R2. In order maximize the likelihood of
correcting any previous negative contributions, the attacker uses the same
energy level within the subset and doubles the transmission power upon
transitioning from one subset to the next. For the reordering R2, the attack is
successful if attack termination happens at the third position of the third subset
(at Pwin = 0.25). However, the attack fails for reordering R1, irrespective
of the point of termination of the attack.
of attack termination. For the choice of the energy level, we
suggest the following:
• Within a subset, the same energy level is used for each
pulse. Given that all pulses belong to different bits, and
the attacker does not know the pulse-to-bit mapping, all
pulses are equally probable to belong to a certain bit.
• When transitioning from one subset to another, the at-
tacker can decide to use the same, increase or decrease
the energy level. In our model, we choose the minimum
energy level that will maximize the likelihood of positive
net power per bit, given that the next pulse polarity is
guessed correctly. As long as negative per-bit correlations
remain, this is equivalent to doubling the power per pulse
upon transitioning.
The energy choice according to this model ensures that the
correct guess of a pulse brings the attacker closer to winning
and an incorrect guess can be corrected in the next subset.
However, in the process of ﬁxing a wrong interference of a bit,
the attacker can end up interfering with another bit. Suppose in
one subset the attacker guesses the polarity of (NB−1) pulses
correctly but guesses one wrong. To maximize his chances
of success in the next subset, he needs to guess the polarity
of the pulse of this particular bit correctly. In the process of
correcting this bit, if the attacker attacks a pulse in the next
subset, the probability of correcting this bit is (0.5 · 1/NB),
and causing a negative contribution to another bit is (0.5 ·
(NB − 1)/NB). By increasing the number of bits reordered,
the probability of interfering with the wrong bit increases. An
attacker also needs to be careful about the when to terminate
the attack. In the example shown in Figure 14, an attacker can
stop interfering after the second or third position of the third
subset. After interfering with the second pulse of the third
subset, the attacker already knows that Pwin is .16. He can
choose to proceed or terminate the attack at this point. For
calculating the results, as shown in Figure 12, we assume that
the attacker continues and terminates the attack at the third
position of the third subset, where Pwin is .25.
