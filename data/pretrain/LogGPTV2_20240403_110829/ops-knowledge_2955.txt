User: I have been tasked with consolidating out entire teams' build process. Including build servers, CI, etc.
The way our project is structured is that each sub team is responsible for the development of their own code bases.
Over time, each team has usually created their own python/sh/bat/Wix depending on the requirements of their deployment.  I've been tasked with consolidating all the builds into one primary Team City system.
Problem is that I've found that  many build scripts (bat files) contain commands such as UI prompting and PAUSEing.
Does anybody know of any way to perhaps suppress those commands prior/during the script execution.
I have considered preprocessing the batch files and removing/REM'ing the Pauses but that is not ideal. Since there are +- 350 individual projects spread across +- 35 HG repositories (which are, in themselves, spread across 4 cities).
Ideally we don't want to perform pre-building cleanup.
Does anyone know of any supper-dupper magic trick to do this or does it required making changes to each build file,
Assistant: First of all, there is no a well behaved way to supress the PAUSE command; however, it is possible to do that in a very simple way. The method consist in modify the cmd.exe file, that is, you may use a binary-hex editor to load cmd.exe file, look for the PAUSE command (that is encoded in two-bytes UNICODE characters), modify it by a different command and save the cmd.exe file. After that, the PAUSE command will no longer work.
Yes, I know that there are multiple reasons to NOT do that; however, I am just answering the question. The OP is responsible to evaluate if this method would be useful for their needs or not.
