## Abstract
This study examines the operational characteristics of the Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, focusing on transitive trust, coresidence, and server placement. We discuss how these factors influence the resilience, stability, and security of DNS services. Our findings indicate that common configuration choices often result in a fragile DNS infrastructure, vulnerable to both malicious attacks and benign failures. We provide recommendations for enhancing the robustness of DNS.

## 1. Introduction
The resilience and availability of the Domain Name System (DNS) are crucial for the stability and functionality of the Internet. Initially designed to translate domain names into IP addresses, the DNS infrastructure has evolved into a complex ecosystem, facilitating a wide range of applications and serving as a key component in scalable network infrastructures.

Best practices for ensuring the availability and security of the DNS infrastructure include:
1. Defining multiple name servers for each domain.
2. Configuring these name servers under at least two different parent domains.
3. Placing physical name servers, which host the zone files for the domain, in separate networks.

Redundancy provides stability and prevents single points of failure. If one parent domain is inaccessible, the domain remains functional via the other parent domain. Similarly, if one network hosting the name servers is under attack, the other name server in an available network can be reached.

However, while redundancy ensures availability, it also introduces new dependencies that can be exploited in attacks. For example, if a vulnerability exists in a network or a name server hosting the domain, it can be used to inject spoofed DNS records for domain hijacking.

The security and availability of domains in DNS also depend on other domains through transitive trust. Transitive trust dependencies, introduced in [4], show that resolving a single domain name often requires traversing multiple other domains. Failure to resolve domains in the transitive trust, due to misconfiguration or attack, can impact all dependent domains.

In this work, we study the operational characteristics of the DNS infrastructure and their impact on resilience, availability, and stability. Specifically, we measure transitive trust dependencies, coresidence, and name server placement. Our investigation covers the top 50,000 Alexa domains and 568 TLDs. We find that:
1. Resolution of names in many domains is susceptible to high latency and even failures due to multiple transitive trust dependencies.
2. High coresidence rates can disrupt services to multiple domains during benign failures or attacks on a single name server.
3. High concentration of name servers in certain geographical locations can facilitate censorship and attacks on a high volume of DNS requests.

## 2. Measuring the Domain Name System
We study the resilience of domains to failures and attacks by measuring:
1. Inter-domain dependencies via transitive trust.
2. Zones coresidence due to name server sharing.
3. Diversity of name server placement.

Our study encompassed the top 25,000 Alexa domains and 568 TLDs. We also measured all the domains depending on these Alexa domains and TLDs via transitive trust, resulting in a total of 150,000 domains. These domains are served by 48,000 name servers, which have 65,000 different IP addresses.

### 2.1 Dependencies via Transitive Trust
Transitive trust dependencies can be twofold:
1. A name server can appear in multiple transitive trust chains, impacting the resilience of the DNS infrastructure.
2. A domain can depend on multiple domains for its resolution, impacting the resilience of a specific domain.

Our study shows that, on average, a domain in the top 25,000 Alexa domains depends on 43.5 other domains via transitive trust chains, and a domain in TLDs depends on 43.7 domains. The maximum number of transitive trust dependencies in Alexa domains is 220, and in TLDs is 183. For instance, the domain `sigcomm.com`, ranked 373,097 on Alexa, is hosted at `dnsmadeeasy.com`, coresiding with 400 other domains.

Figure 2 plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of name servers appearing in transitive trust chains of the top 25,000 Alexa domains and TLDs. Approximately 50% of name servers appear in two or more transitive trust chains, and more than 90% appear in eight or fewer chains. Some name servers appear in more than 128 transitive trust chains.

Figure 3 plots the CDF of the transitive trust dependencies of the top 25,000 Alexa domains and TLDs. Approximately 50% of the domains depend on 20 or more other domains for their resolution, and more than 90% depend on more than 128 domains.

Name servers with high dependencies via transitive trust can become lucrative targets for attacks. For example, [2] demonstrated a DNS cache poisoning attack using fragmented DNS responses to replace the authentic IP address of a victim name server with a spoofed one, targeting `sns-pb.isc.org`, which appears in 69 transitive trust chains.

Large transitive trust chains introduce more latency to record resolution and increase the query rate to name servers appearing in multiple chains. Our study measured an increase of 50 ms for every transitive trust chain of three links, with larger chains often resulting in timeouts and unnecessary retransmissions, overloading the network and name server, and increasing latency for client queries.

Transitive-trust dependencies also nullify the effectiveness of DNSSEC [RFC4033-RFC4035] and impede its adoption [1, 3]. If name servers or other resources of a signed zone are placed under unsigned domains, the resolver will not be able to establish the security of the signed records, and the security will depend on the weakest link in the transitive trust chain.

### 2.2 Dependencies via Coresidence
Hosting multiple zone files on the same name server optimizes profit and reduces operational costs and management overhead. We measure and quantify the dependencies between zones, specifically the fraction of zone files residing on the same physical server.

We measure the coresidence among TLDs and the top 25,000 Alexa domains, including the coresidence between name servers appearing in their transitive trust dependencies. As shown in Figure 4, the coresidence rate among name servers is extremely high. More than 70% of the name servers of Alexa domains and more than 80% of the name servers of TLDs host multiple zones. Some name servers, such as `pdns.ultradns.net`, host more than 500 zone files.

High coresidence rates mean that a failure or DoS attack against a name server or the network hosting it impacts the availability of all zones hosted on it. An attack exploiting a vulnerability in DNS software or the operating system can enable the attacker to take control of the name server and inject records into the zone files. High coresidence also increases packet loss and failures, especially under moderate query rates.

### 2.3 Name Server Redundancy and Placement
We find that a large number of name servers share a geolocation. Most zone files are hosted on name servers located in the U.S. This phenomenon has several side effects:
1. It may make it easier for the U.S. to take down domains hosted on name servers within its borders.
2. It may facilitate redirection of clients to incorrect hosts by injecting spoofed records into zone files, e.g., for censorship.
3. Zone and domain operators must comply with U.S. government policies and regulations.
4. Latency increases with the fraction of coresident zone files. Requests to name servers with more than ten zone files incur, on average, at least 10 milliseconds additional delay compared to requests to name servers hosting two or fewer zone files.

We studied the location of name servers appearing in transitive trust chains of the top 25,000 Alexa domains and TLDs, as shown in Figure 5. We sought to answer two questions:
1. Which country has the most name servers in transitive trust chains?
2. Which country hosts name servers appearing in the most transitive trust chains?

More than 30% of the name servers are located in the U.S., followed by Canada and the U.K. (with Canada leading among Alexa domains and the U.K. among TLDs). "Others" represents different countries hosting less than 1% of the name servers.

Regarding the second question, we found that the name servers appearing in the most transitive trust dependencies of other domains reside in the U.K. A single name server appears in more than 121 different transitive trust chains. The name servers in the U.K. constitute 16% of all the name servers appearing in transitive trust chains, and those in the U.S. constitute 26%.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Our study evaluated factors impacting the availability, resilience, and stability of DNS. Based on our findings, we recommend the following to improve resilience:
1. Reduce coresidence rates by limiting the number of zone files a name server can host.
2. Minimize the appearance of name servers in multiple transitive trust chains by registering them under your own domain.
3. Place name servers in diverse geographical locations.
