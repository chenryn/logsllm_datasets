ABSTRACT
We study the operational characteristics of the DNS in-
frastructure: transitive-trust, coresidence and servers place-
ment. We discuss how these factors impact resilience, sta-
bility and security of the DNS services. As our study indi-
cates, common conﬁguration choices, that domain operators
make, result in a fragile DNS infrastructure, susceptible to
malicious attacks and benign failures. We provide recom-
mendations for improving robustness of DNS.

INTRODUCTION
The resilience and availability of the Domain Name Sys-
tem (DNS), [RFC1034, RFC1035], are critical to the stabil-
ity and functionality of the Internet. Initially designed to
translate domain names to IP addresses, the DNS infras-
tructure has evolved into a complex ecosystem and is in-
creasingly utilised to facilitate a wide range of applications
and constitutes an important building block in the design of
scalable network infrastructures.
Best practices for ensuring availability and security of the
DNS infrastructure recommend (1) deﬁning a number of
name servers for each domain, (2) conﬁguring these name
servers under at least two diﬀerent parent domains and (3)
placing the physical name servers, hosting the zone ﬁles for
the domain, in separate networks. The redundancy pro-
vides for stability of the domain and prevents single point
of failure. In particular, if one of the parent domains is not

accessible, the domain will remain functional via the other
parent domain; in case one of the networks, hosting the name
servers, is under attack, the other name server, located in
available networks, can be reached.
On the ﬂip side, while ensuring availability, this redun-
dancy introduces new dependencies which can be utilised to
attack the domain. Speciﬁcally, if vulnerability exists in a
network or a name server hosting the domain, it can be ex-
ploited to attack the domain, e.g., inject spoofed DNS record
for domain hijacking.
The security and availability of domains in DNS also de-
pends on other domains via a transitive trust. Transitive
trust dependencies were introduced in [4], which observed
that resolving a single domain name often requires travers-
ing multiple other domains. Failure to resolve the domains
in the transitive trust, e.g., due to misconﬁguration or at-
tack, or resolution to an incorrect address, may impact all
the dependant domains.
In this work we study the operational characteristics of
the DNS infrastructure and their impact on resilience, avail-
ability and stability of the DNS services. Speciﬁcally, we
measure transitive trust dependencies, coresidence and name
servers placement. Our investigation comprises top 50,000
Alexa domains1 (www.alexa.com/topsites) and 568 TLDs.
We show that: (1) resolution of names in many domains are
susceptible to high latency and even failures due to multiple
transitive trust dependencies; (2) high coresidence rate can
disrupt services to multiple domains during benign failures
or attacks on a single name server; (3) high concentration
of name servers in certain geographical locations can facil-
itate censorship of (and attacks on) a high volume of DNS
requests.
Domain Name System. DNS is a client-server protocol.
The client side of the DNS infrastructure is composed of
resolvers, which lookup records in zones by sending DNS re-
quests to corresponding name servers. The resolvers commu-
nicate to the name servers using a simple request-response
protocol (typically over UDP); for instance, (abstracting
out subtleties) to translate www.foo.bar resolvers locate the
name server ns.foo.bar, authoritative for foo.bar, and ob-
tain the IP address of the machine hosting the web server
of the website www.foo.bar; see sample resolution process
in Figure 1. Resolvers store DNS records, returned in re-
sponses, in their caches for the duration indicated in the
Time To Live (TTL) ﬁeld of each record set. The resource
records in DNS correspond to the diﬀerent services run by

the organisations and networks, e.g., hosts, servers, network
blocks. The zones are structured hierarchically, with the
root zone at the ﬁrst level, Top Level Domains (TLDs) at the
second level, and millions of Second Level Domains (SLDs)
at the third level.
2. MEASURING DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
We study resilience of the domains to failures and attacks
by measuring: (1) inter-domain dependencies via transitive
trust, (2) zones coresidence due to name servers sharing and
(3) diversity of name servers’ placement.
Our study encompassed top 25K Alexa domains and 568
TLDs. We also measured all the domains depending on
these Alexa domains and TLDs via a transitive trust, which
resulted in a total of 150K domains. These domains are
served by 48K name servers; these 48K name servers have
65K diﬀerent IP addresses, since sometimes a single name
server is assigned a number of IP addresses.
2.1 Dependencies via Transitive Trust
A transitive trust dependency can be twofold: (1) a name
server can appear in a number of transitive trust chains (i.e.,
how many domains can be impacted by a failure of a speciﬁc
name server), and (2) a domain can depend on multiple
domains for its resolution (i.e., a failure of a single server
can impact the latency or availability of a domain). The
former impacts the resilience of the DNS infrastructure and
the later the resilience of a speciﬁc domain. Ideally, both
should be low.
Our study shows that on average a domain in 25K-top
Alexa depends on 43.5 other domains via transitive trust
chains, and on average a domain in TLD depends on 43.7
domains via transitive trust chains. The maximal number
of transitive trust dependencies in Alexa domains is 220 and
in TLDs is 183. For instance, domain sigcomm.com, ranked
373097 on Alexa, is hosted at dnsmadeeasy.com, coresiding
with 400 other domains.
Figure 2 plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF)
F (x) = Pr[X ≤ x] of the number of name servers appear-
ing in transitive trust chains of 25K-top Alexa domains and
TLDs; this encompasses the ﬁrst dependency and increases
the traﬃc volume to the name servers and resolution latency
for the clients. The CDF curves for the Alexa domains and
TLDs represent the number of transitive trust chains that
a name server in Alexa domains (resp. TLDs) appears in.
Approximately, 50% of name servers appear in two or more

transitive trust chains. More than 90% of the name servers
appear in 8 and less chains. Some name servers appear in
more than 128 transitive trust chains. Figure 3 plots the
CDF of the transitive trust dependencies of 25K-top Alexa
domains and TLDs; this expresses the second dependency
(2) - and increases resolution time for the clients. Approx-
imately 50% depend on 20 or more other domains for their
resolution, and more than 90% depend on more than 128
domains.

Name servers with high dependencies via transitive trust,
i.e., whereby multiple domains depend on them for their
resolution, have two side eﬀects: (1) they can become a lu-
crative target for attacks. For instance, recently, [2], showed
how to launch a DNS cache poisoning attack using frag-
mented DNS responses, to replace the authentic IP address
of a victim name server with a spoofed one, and ran this
against sns-pb.isc.org name server, which appears in 69
transitive trust chains of other domains.
(2) Another notable side eﬀect is that large transitive trust
chains introduce more latency to resolution of records within
domains depending on many other domains, and increase the
queries rate to name servers appearing in multiple transitive
trust chains. Our study measured an increase of 50ms for
every transitive trust chain of 3 links, when measured with
a cold (empty) cache. Resolutions of larger chains, e.g.,
200, can often result in timeouts and unnecessary retrans-
missions, overloading the network and the name server, and
increasing the latency for clients’ queries.
Transitive-trust dependencies also nullify eﬀectiveness of
DNSSEC, [RFC4033-RFC4035], and impede its adoption
[1, 3]. In particular, if name servers or other resources of a
signed zone are placed under unsigned domains, the DNS re-

solver will not be able to establish the security of the signed
records, and the security will depend on the the security of
the weakest link in a transitive trust chain.
2.2 Dependencies via Coresidence
Hosting a number of zones ﬁles on the same name server
enables DNS name server operators to optimise proﬁt and re-
duce operational costs and management overhead. We mea-
sure and quantify the dependencies between zones, namely
the fraction of zone ﬁles residing on the same physical server.
We measure the coresidence among TLDs and 25K-top Alexa
domains, including the coresidence between name servers
appearing in their transitive trust dependencies. As our re-
sults, plotted in see Figure 4, indicate, the coresidence rate
among the name servers are extremely high. We found that
coresidence of multiple zones on the same name server is
a common practice among Alexa domains and TLDs.
In
particular, more than 70% of the name servers of Alexa do-
mains and more than 80% of the name servers of TLDs, host
multiple zones. Some name servers host more than 500 zone
ﬁles, such as the name server pdns.ultradns.net.
The implications of high coresidence rate is that a failure
or a DoS attack against the availability of the name server
or the network hosting it, impacts the availability of all of
the zones hosted on it. An attack against a name server,
e.g., exploiting a vulnerability in a DNS software or in the
operating system, can enable the attacker to take control
over the name server and inject records into the zone ﬁles
hosted on it. We also ﬁnd that high coresidence increases
loss and failures. In particular, even a moderate queries rate
can result in packets’ loss. Of course, high coresidence rates,
large requests rate or responses sizes further exacerbate the
problem.
2.3 Name Servers Redundancy and Placement
We ﬁnd that a large number of name servers share a geolo-
cation. Name servers hosting most zone ﬁles are located in
the U.S.; The side eﬀects of this phenomenon are that: (1)
this may make it easier for the U.S. to take down domains
hosted on name servers within its boarders; (2) this may fa-
cilitate redirection of clients to incorrect hosts by injection
of spoofed records into the zone ﬁles, e.g., for censorship; (3)
the zones and domain operators have to be compliant with
the policies and regulations of the U.S. government; (4) the
latency increases with the fraction of coresident zone ﬁles, in
particular, we observed that requests to name servers with
more than ten zone ﬁles incur on average at least 10 millisec-
onds additional delay than requests to name servers hosting
2 or less zone ﬁles.
We studied location of name servers appearing in transi-
tive trust chains of 25K-top Alexa domains and of TLDs,
Figure 5. The question that we seek to answer is twofold:
(1) which country has most name servers in transitive trust
chains, and (2) which country hosts name servers appearing
in most transitive trust chains.
The answer to the ﬁrst question is that more than 30%
of the name servers are located in the U.S. Then Canada
and U.K. (with Canada leading among Alexa domains, and
U.K. among TLDs).
‘Others’ stands for diﬀerent countries
hosting less than 1% of the name servers.
With respect to the second question, we found that the
name servers appearing in most transitive trust dependen-
cies of other domains reside in the U.K., e.g., a single name
server appears in more than 121 diﬀerent transitive trust
chains (and this holds for a number of name servers located
in the U.K.). The name servers in the U.K. constitute 16%
of all the name servers appearing in transitive trust chains,
and the name servers in the US constitute 26%.

Conclusions and Recommendations
Our study evaluated factors impacting availability, resilience
and stability of DNS. Based on our ﬁndings we make the fol-
lowing recommendations for improving the resilience: (1)
reduce coresidence rates by limiting the number of zone
ﬁles that a name server can host, (2) reduce appearences
of name servers in multiple transitive trust chains, by regis-
tering name servers under your own domain, (3) place name
servers in diverse geo-locations.
