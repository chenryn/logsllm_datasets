I can write Persian text (almost same as Arabic) in Atom even though it does
not appear right to left. I can live with it, the problem is when I try to
edit the text and I position the cursor somewhere inside the text and begin to
type, the characters appear somewhere else, a few characters away.
To show you a good example of correct behavior I should mention _gedit_. Using
_gedit_ to write Persian blog posts in markdown format, I have no problem
entering and editing the text. Everything works as expected, I don't know
which GUI component is being used in Atom and Gedit, probably that's the
difference. Here are some screenshots showing the texts but I have no way to
show the typing problem.
