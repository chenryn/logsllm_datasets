In this section, we introduce some deﬁnitions that are useful
to understand the pivoting attack presented in this paper. Then,
we brieﬂy present some background information about the
BLE and Zigbee protocols lower layers.
A. Digital modulation
Digital modulation is deﬁned as the process of transforming
a digital signal (the modulating signal) to adapt it to the trans-
mission channel. This transformation consists in modifying
the characteristics of a sine wave, called a carrier, according
to the data to be transmitted. The resulting signal is called the
modulated signal.
The modulated signal is deﬁned by the following equation:
s(t) = A(t) cos(2πfct + ϕ(t))
(1)
where A(t), fc, and ϕ(t) represent the amplitude, frequency
and phase of the signal, respectively.
The state of a modulated signal at a given time can be
represented by a vector in the complex plan: the norm of
the vector represents the amplitude of the signal, while its
argument corresponds to its phase. Indeed, formula (1) can be
written as follows:
(2)
s(t) = I(t) cos(2πfct) − Q(t) sin(2πfct)
• I(t) = A(t) cos(ϕ(t)) ”In-phase component”
• Q(t) = A(t) sin(ϕ(t)) ”Quadrature component”
Note also that equation (2) demonstrates that it is possible
to control the instantaneous phase, the instantaneous frequency
and the amplitude of a carrier wave by manipulating the
amplitude of I and Q signals. This property is the basis of
a so-called I/Q modulator.
B. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
The Bluetooth Low Energy protocol, or BLE, is a simpliﬁed
variant of the Bluetooth protocol, introduced in version 4.0 of
the Bluetooth speciﬁcation [20]. In particular, it is optimised
for energy saving and is commonly used in IoT networks,
due to its low complexity and its wide deployment. It is also
supported by default by most smartphones and computers.
In this paper, we focus on the lower layers of the protocol,
notably the physical layer. The physical layer of the protocol
(PHY layer) describes a single packet format composed of the
following ﬁelds:
• Preamble: one byte ﬁeld corresponding to series of
alternating bits (0x55), used to synchronise the receiver
at the start of the frame,
• Access Address: 4 bytes ﬁeld, allowing to identify a
speciﬁc connection or an advertisement,
• Protocol Data Unit (PDU): ﬁeld of variable size made
up of a link-layer header (LL Header) and the data to be
transmitted,
• Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): 3 bytes ﬁeld for
integrity checking based on cyclic redundancy code.
When a frame is transmitted,
the data from the upper
layers is preﬁxed with a header by the link layer (LL), and
is encapsulated into the PDU ﬁeld. The corresponding CRC
is appended to the PDU. A transformation called whitening
is then applied, allowing the generation of a pseudo-random
sequence, in order to avoid the presence of long repeated
sequences of 1 or 0, which could alter the transmission of
the modulated signal. Finally, the preamble and the Access
Address are included before the PDU and the frame is then
processed by the modulator.
The physical
layer of the BLE protocol
is based on a
frequency modulation, called Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying
(GFSK), operating in the ISM band (from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz). It is
a variant of the 2-Frequency Shift Keying (2-FSK) modulation
in which a gaussian ﬁlter is applied to the modulating signal
to avoid abrupt changes in frequency upon symbol changes.
A 2-FSK modulation consists in encoding two symbols (0
and 1 for binary data) by two different frequencies deﬁned by
the following formulas:
F0 = fc − ∆f = fc − m
2Ts
m
2Ts
F1 = fc + ∆f = fc +
(3)
(4)
• fc is the frequency of the carrier, called central frequency,
• ∆f is the modulation deviation (deﬁned as the lag
between the frequency encoding the symbol and the
frequency of the carrier),
• m is the modulation index (a value between 0 and 1
characterizing the modulation),
• Ts is the symbol duration (the inverse of the data rate).
This modulation provides a modulated signal whose signal
envelope amplitude is constant and its phase is continuous
over time. In addition, the instantaneous phase ϕ(t) and the
instantaneous frequency f (t) are linked as follows:
f (t) =
1
2π
dϕ(t)
dt
(5)
Thus, the variation of instantaneous frequency can be in-
ferred by observing the direction of rotation of the instanta-
neous phase: an increase in frequency (encoding the value 1)
will cause a counter-clockwise rotation of the phase, while
a decrease in frequency (encoding the value 0) will cause
the phase to rotate clockwise. Such a modulation can thus
be represented in the complex plan by observing the direction
of rotation of the phase, as illustrated in Figure 1.
Fig. 1: I/Q representation of a 2-FSK modulation
BLE speciﬁcation states that the modulation index must be
set between 0.45 and 0.55. The symbol duration Ts depends on
the mode in use. Indeed, the ﬁrst versions of the speciﬁcation
required a data rate of 1 Mbit/s (i.e., Ts = 10−6s). However,
version 5 introduced two new operating modes for the physical
layer: LE Coded, that is out of the scope of the paper, and LE
2M, operating at 2 Mbits/s (i.e., Ts = 5 × 10−7s).
The central frequency depends on the communication chan-
nel. Indeed,
the speciﬁcation proposes 40 communication
channels in the ISM frequency band (from 2.4 to 2.5 GHz),
each with a bandwidth of 2 MHz. Three of these channels
(37, 38 and 39) were initially dedicated to the broadcasting of
announcement messages (advertising channels) while the other
37 channels were dedicated for data exchange in connected
mode (data channels). However, the addition of new modes,
LE Coded and LE 2M, introduces the possibility to use data
channels as secondary advertising channels. Each channel
being identiﬁed by a number k ∈ [0..39]. The channels 37,
38 and 39 respectively use the frequencies 2402, 2426 and
2480 MHz. The other channels, from 0 to 36, are spaced of
2MHz from 2404MHz skipping those frequencies.
C. Zigbee
Zigbee is one of the most widespread wireless protocols
in IoT networks. Its low power consumption, the low cost of
radio devices and the ability to build complex topologies make
it particularly attractive for IoT systems. It is compliant with
the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [21] which deﬁnes the physical
and link layers. Its speciﬁcation mainly describes the upper
layers of the protocol stack (i.e., the network and application
layers). In this paper, we focus on the lower layers, and more
speciﬁcally on the 802.15.4 standard physical layer. This layer
(called PHY) deﬁnes the format of the frames (named Physical
Protocol Data Unit, or PPDU), as follows:
• Preamble: 4 consecutive null bytes ﬁeld (0x00 0x00
0x00 0x00), used to synchronise the receiver with the
beginning of the frame,
• Start of Frame Delimiter (SFD): one byte ﬁeld of value
0x7A, indicating the beginning of the frame,
• Length (PHR): one byte ﬁeld encoding the size in bytes
of the Protocol Service Data Unit,
Counter-clockwiserotation: 1Clockwiserotation: 0Q(quadrature)I(In-phase)f↗f↘• Protocol Service Data Unit (PSDU): ﬁeld of variable
length, encapsulating the frame at link layer (or MAC).
This frame is composed of a header, (MHR), the data to
be encapsulated, transmitted by the upper layers, as well
as a two bytes ﬁeld, the Frame Check Sequence (FCS),
used to check the integrity of the received frame.
Acccording to the 802.15.4 standard, a spread spectrum tech-
nique (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum or DSSS) is applied
to the generated frame before it is processed by the modulator.

Each byte is split
Signiﬁcant Bits (LSB) and the Most Signiﬁcant Bits (MSB).
Each of these blocks is then substituted by a pseudo-random
sequence of 32 bits, called PN sequence (Pseudorandom
Noise) according to the correspondences presented in Table
I. The bits of this sequence are also called chips.

PN sequences are then provided as input of the modulator.
The physical layer of the 802.15.4 standard is based on a phase
modulation called Offset Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (or
O-QPSK) with half sine pulse shaping in the ISM band. This
modulation corresponds to a variant of the Quadrature Phase
Shift Keying phase modulation, which consists in encoding
the binary input information by modulating the phase of the
carrier. Four phase values are used to transmit four symbols,
each symbol being composed of two consecutive bits. In the
speciﬁc case of Zigbee and O-QPSK modulation, each symbol
is composed of 2 chips.
To generate a 802.15.4 compliant signal, it is necessary
to independently control the In-phase and Quadrature com-
ponents used to modulate the even bits and the odd bits,
respectively. The ﬁrst step consists in transforming the binary
message to be modulated into two sequences of half sine
pulses of duration Ts = 2Tb (where Tb corresponds to half the
duration of a symbol): a 1 bit is encoded by a positive half
sine pulse while a 0 is encoded by a negative half sine pulse.
As a result, I(t) is a sequence of half sine pulses representing
the even bits while Q(t) is a sequence of half sine pulses
representing the odd bits. The Quadrature component is also
temporally delayed of Tb in order to avoid some drawbacks
linked to QPSK modulation.
Then, the modulated signal s(t) can be generated from
the In-Phase and Quadrature signals using formula 2. This

with half sine pulse shaping
2 and − π
modulation generates a signal with continuous phase jumps,
evolving linearly during the period of a Tb chip: the instanta-
neous phase of the modulated signal thus becomes continuous
as a function of time and the amplitude of the signal’s envelope
remains constant, as shown in ﬁgure 2. Thus, at each sampling
instant, there are only two possible transitions to the following
state: + π
2 . The transition to be made depends on: 1)
the value of the previous bit, 2) whether an even bit or an
odd bit is currently modulated, and 3) the current state. For
instance, if the current state corresponds to symbol 11 and
if one wishes to modulate an odd bit set to 1, one will take
the transition to state 01, which will cause a linear increase
of + π
2 in the instantaneous phase during the period Tb. The
constellation diagram is represented in Figure 3.
Fig. 3: I/Q representation of O-QPSK modulation with half
sine pulse shaping
The 802.15.4 standard speciﬁcation indicates a data rate
of 2 Mchips/s in the ISM band, which corresponds to Tb =
5 × 10−7s. Consequently, the data rate corresponding to the
bits of the PPDU before the substitution of the PN sequences
corresponds to 250 kbits/s. The carrier wave frequency (called
−101m(t)−101I(t)−101Q(t)−101I(t)cos(2πfct)−101Q(t)sin(2πfct)−101s(t)Q (quadrature)I  (In-phase)1100011010101010phase transition (odd bits)phase transition (even bits)central frequency as in BLE) depends on the communication
channel used. The 802.15.4 standard proposes use of 16 com-
munication channels, from 11 to 26 with a 2 MHz bandwidth
per channel. Two consecutive channels are spaced 3 MHz
apart. The following formula gives the relationship between
the central frequency fc (in MHz) and the channel number k
(from 11 to 26):
fc = 2405 + 5(k − 11)
IV. THE WAZABEE ATTACK
(6)
This section describes the WazaBee attack and its architec-
ture, which aims to divert the use of the radio device embedded
in the BLE chip in order to send and receive 802.15.4 frames
(in particular Zigbee frames). We ﬁrst describe the attack
principle and its theoretical foundations, then we detail the
various requirements related to the legitimate operation of
the chip that must be taken into account for the attack to
be successful and we provide some solutions to fulﬁl these
requirements.
A. Assumptions
We consider that the attacker has already compromised a
BLE chip and is able to run arbitrary code on it. This chip
compromise may be performed using various techniques, such
as network attacks (e.g. attack of an Over The Air update
process [22]), exploitation of vulnerabilities inherent to the
object
itself and its ﬁrmware allowing some remote code
execution [23], [24], or physical attacks allowing to ﬂash the
device [25]. This compromise is considered as a prerequisite
to the WazaBee attack, and is out of the scope of this paper.
B. Attack overview
The Wazabee attack relies on the existence of a close
relationship between GFSK and O-QPSK, the modulations
used by BLE and Zigbee protocols. The following subsections
explain how to switch from one modulation to another.
1) From GFSK to MSK modulation: As explained in pre-
vious sections, BLE uses a Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying
modulation with a modulation index m between 0.45 and 0.55.
This characteristic allows us to assimilate the BLE modulation
to a speciﬁc case of GFSK, called GMSK (Gaussian Minimum
Shift Keying) with a modulation index m = 1
2. The signal
generated by a GMSK modulation has a constant amplitude
and a phase evolving continuously over time. Moreover, a
GMSK modulation is a MSK modulation (Minimum Shift
Keying) whose modulating signal is shaped by a Gaussian
ﬁlter. If we neglect the effect of the Gaussian ﬁlter, BLE
modulation can be assimilated to MSK modulation, which
changes linearly and continuously the phase of − π
2 when
modulating a 0-bit and of + π
2 when modulating a 1-bit.
2) From MSK to O-QPSK modulation: As explained in
