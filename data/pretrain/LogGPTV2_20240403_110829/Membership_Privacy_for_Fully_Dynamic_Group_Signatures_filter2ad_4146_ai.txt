G2 and 1 in Z∗
p. As mentioned in the introduction and similar to the static group signature in [6], we
will instantiate the SPS-EQ with the scheme from [25]. This means that the SPS-EQ signature takes
10 elements in G1 and 4 elements in G2. Note that both building blocks are secure under standard
assumptions.
To properly calculate the signature size, we have to instantiate the proof system ΠPPE. Recall,
that this is a proof for the statement:
∃ (pkSFPK, r, w1, w2) s. t.
SFPK ∧ IsCanonical(pkSFPK) ∨ e(w1, K2) = e(w2, g2).
(cid:48)
SFPK.ChgPK(pkSFPK, r) = pk
Taking into account that we will use Scheme 2, this statement can be simpliﬁed in a way that the
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
(cid:48)
scheme and the security proofs still work. Let pk
2) and pkSFPK = (pk1, pk2), we can
1, pk
SFPK = (pk
(cid:48)
1, gr−1
then express this proof by the pairing product equations: e(w1, K2) = e(w2, g2) and e(pk
) =
e(g1, g2) · e(w1, g2). It is easy to see that the witness (r, w1, w2) = (0, (g1)−1, (K1)−1) is a trapdoor
(cid:48)
witness that can be used in the security proof to create a valid proof for an arbitrary pk
SFPK. The
canonical representative pkSFPK is only used by the tracing authority to open signatures. However, by
(cid:48)
extracting the witness R = gr−1
2, R) = e(gx
1 , then e(pk
1 , g2) is
(cid:48)
a static value that is common for all public keys in relation with pk
SFPK. Since the tracing authority
has access to the registration table that contains public keys in canonical form of active members,
we conclude that it can still correctly open signatures. This also does not inﬂuence any of the proofs.
Instantiating those equations using the ﬁne-tuned Groth-Sahai proofs presented in [24] (assum-
ing decisional Diﬃe-Hellman), the proof size is 10 elements in G1 and 8 elements in G2. This is
constituted by: 1) two group elements in G2 for the ﬁrst equation, which is linear, 2) four elements
(cid:48)
2 = gx·r
it can still do this because if pk
2
2
30
in G1 and G2 for the second equation, 3) six elements in G1 for the three witnesses in G1, 4) two
elements in G2 for the witness r. Overall the group signature is composed of 28 elements in G1,
15 in G2 and 1 in Z∗
p. We provide a comparison with existing group signature schemes in Figure 5.
Note that we do not include schemes from lattices in our comparison, because the only constant-size
scheme was proposed by Ling et al. [39] and as argued by the authors the size is impractical.
It remains to show how to instantiate the digital signature scheme DS, the public key encryption
scheme PKE and the proof system ΠGS.Judge. The ﬁrst two building blocks are standard and can
easily instantiated in the standard model from simple assumptions. In case of PKE we can use the El
Gamal encryption scheme, which is key-private. Finally, the system ΠGS.Judge can also be instantiated
using Groth-Sahai proofs for pairing product equations [24]. Note that this basically means that the
tracing authority has to prove correct decryption of an El-Gamal ciphertext and that its public key
was generated using a DDH tuple, which can easily be expressed as pairing product equations.
