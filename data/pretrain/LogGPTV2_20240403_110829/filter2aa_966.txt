### Why This Matters (Part 1)

**Incident: April 26, 2003, 9:57 PM**
- Emergency Medical Services (EMS) received a call that highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the 911 system.

**Research Aims:**
- Investigate potential vulnerabilities across the entire 911 system.
- Detail current attacks being carried out on the 911 system.
- Propose solutions for existing vulnerabilities and anticipate potential vectors for future infrastructure modifications.

- 100%
- 80%
- 60%
- 40%
- 20%
- 0%

**Time between collapse and defibrillation (minutes):**
- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

**EMS Arrival Time based on TFD 90% Code 3 Response in FY2008. Standards of Response Coverage 2008.**

- **EMS Arrival:**
  - No CPR
  - Traditional CPR
  - CCO CPR

#### Strategic Threat Agents
- 6000 PSAPs taking a combined 660,000 calls per day.
- Fundamental building block of our collective security.
- Potential damage extends beyond individual people not being able to talk to 911.
