# Creating the DEFCON China 1.0 Badge
## Joe Grand (aka Kingpin)

### Introduction and Badge History
The DEFCON badge is a unique and interactive way to bring the community together, embodying the spirit of the DEFCON experience. The goal was to create a simple yet expandable design that could be further developed during and after the event. Key features include:
- **Interactivity**: A command-based menu for additional exploration.
- **Community Engagement**: Tasks and rewards to foster interaction and collaboration.

### Goals
- **Task Completion and Rewards**: Participants complete tasks and are rewarded.
- **LED Indicators**: The badge features 4 roots and 4 branches, each with 4 LEDs.
- **Unlocking Mechanism**: When a task is completed, the badge is inserted into a programmer to unlock an LED.
- **Special Effects**: Unique events occur when all tasks in a root are completed, and even more special effects when all roots are completed.

### Gameplay
#### Early Concepts and Prototyping
The initial stages involved brainstorming and prototyping various ideas to ensure the badge met the desired goals and functionality.
