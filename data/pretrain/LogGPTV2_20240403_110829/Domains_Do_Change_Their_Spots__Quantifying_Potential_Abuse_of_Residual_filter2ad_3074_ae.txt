### Security Risks and Exploitation

**a) Malicious Domains:**
Obtaining control of domains associated with malicious activity and botnets allows new owners to hijack these networks of compromised machines at a low financial cost.

**b) Name Servers (DNS):**
DNS servers are crucial to the Internet, and attacks or misconfigurations can paralyze regions of the web. Surprisingly, we were able to register multiple high-volume name servers, including two that were sinkholes for a security company contracted by many ISPs to protect against DoS attacks. By obtaining control of such servers, a malicious actor can potentially hijack all C&C botnets that security companies and registrars worked to redirect. We also obtained control of internetemc.com, which belonged to an ISP in Georgia but received fewer requests than expected, likely because it was a secondary name server.

**c) Stale Content and Resources:**
We re-registered expired domains that offered now-stale content and resources. The most notable is tianxingmeng.com, which had the highest traffic in terms of raw packet count. Based on the massive number of packets to ports {8000, 6600}, it likely hosted an internet radio stream. Controlling such a domain enables manipulation of its content, facilitating social engineering attacks and spreading fake news. Other domains include ctnetload1.com, which served a JavaScript file used by cryptocurrency blogs, and tattooes.info, whose gallery of tattoo images was indexed by search engines. Re-registering these domains can enable social engineering and supply chain attacks.

**d) Mirrored Domains:**
We found evidence of several domains belonging to the same entity, resolving to the same IP address before they expired. These mirrored domains, while structurally similar, were not typosquatting each other. We identified mirrored domains for five different entities, four offering online gambling services and one offering document forgery. Re-registering these domains can facilitate phishing attacks, as users may be misled into entering their credentials, allowing attackers to inflict financial harm or compromise other accounts.

### Related Work

The security community has previously investigated the abuse of residual trust in expired domain names. Prior work focused on a bottom-up, targeted approach, investigating specific targets and how expired domains could be exploited. For example, Moore and Clayton studied what became of expired US bank domains, and Lever et al. introduced the concept of residual trust and proposed defense mechanisms. In contrast, our top-down, target-agnostic approach confirms the feasibility of this attack vector and discovers the scope and severity of potential harm. Our results show that opportunistic adversaries can gain access to millions of unique IP addresses by spending an average of $7.29 per expired domain.

### Discussion and Conclusions

Our systematic yet opportunistic approach demonstrates the alarming potential for abuse of residual trust by re-registering previously popular expired domains and detecting residual trust traffic. This approach is simple, target-agnostic, and scalable. It confirms the realism of concerns raised by prior bottom-up approaches. We re-registered domains that previously served various purposes, including torrent trackers, APIs, and security company DNS sinkhole servers.

**Ethics:**
We took precautions to minimize risk, such as not advertising the domains and serving only custom 404 HTTP(S) pages with bot traps and JavaScript fingerprinting code. We stored only initial client data and did not engage further. We collected browser fingerprints using FingerprintJS, but this data is only valuable for aggregate statistics and cannot be used to track users across the web.

**Limitations:**
Our top-down approach may miss valuable domains with few DNS resolutions and may be more costly to exploit. A bottom-up, targeted approach provides a deeper understanding of the target's system and infrastructure, making exploitation more straightforward.

This study highlights the need for better monitoring and protection of expired domains to prevent potential security risks.
