User: Please use Python to write a program to realize the function of converting an Excel table into a CSV file.
Assistant: The following is the Python code implementation: ```python import pandas as pd # Read Excel files df = pd.read_excel('example.xlsx') # Save DataFrame data as CSV files df.to_csv('example.csv', index =False) ``` Among them, the `pd.read_excel()` function is used to read the Excel file and returns an object of type DataFrame. The `df.to_csv()` function is used to save the DataFrame data as a CSV file, and specifies whether to save the row index.
