 **Edit: I'm guessing this is known and just unavoidable without some extra
working around using the resolution of the promise returned
from`dock.show()`?**

### Expected Behavior
Duplicate app icons shouldn't be possible.
### Actual Behavior
Duplicate icons can accumulate. After quitting the application the extra icons
remain and cannot be quit or force quit to get rid of them. Oddly, simply
left-clicking them does get them to go away.
### To Reproduce
      remote.app.dock.show();
      setTimeout(remote.app.dock.hide, 50);
      setTimeout(remote.app.dock.show, 100);
      setTimeout(remote.app.dock.hide, 150);
      setTimeout(remote.app.dock.show, 200);
      setTimeout(remote.app.dock.hide, 250);
> Note: `remote` not required, just easier
### Additional Information
If a user tries to force quit a zombie icon, macOS will prevent re-opening the
app without the user acknowledging that it crashed last time, as it would if
you actually force quit the app.
This should be easy enough for users to workaround, but I assume this isn't
the intended behavior.
Edit: Simply checking for `!dock.isVisible()` before calling `dock.show()` is
insufficient to prevent this behavior. The bug persists
The real world situation for this is an application that hides/shows with a
global hotkey - a user may hit the hotkey by accident and then again to hide
it, but they may end up with duplicated dock icons because of this quick
action. I toggle back and forth 3x in the repro code above to ensure
reproduction, but it can be reproduced with less.
