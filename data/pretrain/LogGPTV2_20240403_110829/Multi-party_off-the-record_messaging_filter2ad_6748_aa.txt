## Abstract
Most cryptographic algorithms ensure secret and authentic communication. However, in many scenarios, the ability to repudiate messages or deny a conversation is equally important. For whistleblowers, informants, political dissidents, and journalists, deniable communication is crucial, as electronic communication must mimic the privacy of face-to-face meetings. Oﬀ-the-Record Messaging (OTR), proposed by Borisov, Goldberg, and Brewer in 2004, and its subsequent improvements, simulate private two-party conversations. Despite some attempts, the multi-party scenario remains unresolved.

In this paper, we first identify the properties of multi-party private meetings. We highlight the differences between physical and electronic mediums and between two- and multi-party scenarios, which have significant implications for the design of private chatrooms. We then propose a solution for multi-party off-the-record instant messaging that satisfies these properties. Our solution is also composable with extensions that provide other properties, such as anonymity.

## 1. Motivation
The Internet provides a novel means of communication through instant messaging (IM), enabling users to engage in active conversations across great distances. However, IM lacks certain fundamental security properties that are inherent in physical private conversations. Impersonation, eavesdropping, and information copying are common threats in IM.

Online communication systems typically offer confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. While confidentiality and authentication are expected in face-to-face conversations, non-repudiation conflicts with the expectations of private communication. Non-repudiation allows a receiver to prove to a third party, such as a judge, that the sender authored a message. This property is often undesirable for journalists, dissidents, or informants.

Borisov, Goldberg, and Brewer [6] argued that instant messaging should mimic casual conversations, where participants can deny their statements to outsiders and even deny participation. They introduced Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR) to provide confidentiality, authentication, repudiation, and forward secrecy for two-party conversations using standard IM protocols.

Despite its good design, OTR has limitations, primarily that it only serves two users. This makes it unsuitable for multi-party conversations, which are common in Internet Relay Chat (IRC), open-source software development, and business settings. Extending OTR to multi-party conversations is challenging because OTR uses cryptographic primitives designed for two parties, such as message authentication codes (MACs), which do not provide origin authentication in multi-party settings.

Bian, Seker, and Topaloglu [4] proposed a method to extend OTR for group conversations by designating one user as a "virtual server." However, this approach deviates from the original OTR goal of mimicking private conversations, as there is no virtual server in private group conversations. Additionally, the server becomes a target for malicious attacks and must be assumed to be honest, which is a significant limitation.

In this work, we present a multi-party off-the-record protocol (mpOTR) that provides confidentiality, authenticity, and deniability for conversations among an arbitrary number of participants. Our protocol allows an ad hoc group of individuals to communicate interactively without a central authority. We identify the key traits of multi-party authentication for users, messages, and chatrooms, and consider the presence of malicious insiders. Our mpOTR protocol enhances deniability, allowing users to deny everything except their willingness to engage in a conversation, thus more closely simulating deniability in physical private conversations.

### 1.1 Related Work
While not the first to address security in instant messaging, Borisov, Goldberg, and Brewer [6] popularized its privacy aspects, partly due to their widely-used open-source plugin. Subsequent research addressed errors in the original OTR proposal [10], leading to improved versions.

There are two main approaches to secure IM: establishing connections via a centralized server for security and authentication [16], or using shared knowledge for peer-to-peer authentication [1]. OTR, aiming to simulate casual conversations, follows the latter approach.

Little research has focused on multi-party privacy in IM. The only published work with the explicit goal of achieving group off-the-record conversations is by Bian, Seker, and Topaloglu [4], which has similarities to Mannan and Van Oorschot's work on two-party IM [16]. In some cases, such as in the Navy [9], a trusted superuser can be established, but in casual settings, agreeing on a server user is problematic. We adopt a model where all users are equal.

## 2. Private Chatrooms

### 2.1 Confidentiality
In private meetings, a user ˆA is willing to reveal information to chatroom members but not to outsiders. Therefore, chatroom messages must remain hidden from the wider community. In physical communication, new participants can be detected, and appropriate actions can be taken. On the Internet, eavesdropping is harder to detect, but cryptographic algorithms can ensure that eavesdroppers gain no additional knowledge beyond message lengths and traffic patterns.

### 2.2 Entity Authentication
In face-to-face meetings, peers are identified by appearance and physical attributes. On the Internet, entity authentication involves proving knowledge of secret identifying information. The goal is to show that a peer who presents a public key S ˆB also holds the corresponding private key s ˆB. Two-party entity authentication has been studied in the context of OTR by Alexander and Goldberg [1, §4 and §5].

For mpOTR, the goal is to provide a consistent view of chatroom participants. We achieve this by requiring pairwise authentication and exchanging short messages about the expected chatroom membership. Alternatively, an n-party authentication primitive could be used to authenticate all users simultaneously.

### 2.3 Origin Authentication
Each message has a well-defined source. The goal of origin authentication is to correctly identify the source. A user must be assured that the message is sent from a legitimate participant. In OTR, if Alice is assured that a valid OTR peer sent a message and that peer is not Alice herself, she knows Bob sent the message. In mpOTR, Alice should be able to distinguish messages from different participants and identify origins with respect to chatrooms. Message authentication should be non-repudiable among chat participants to allow honest users to relay messages or expose dishonest users. However, this introduces subtleties when combined with deniability requirements.
