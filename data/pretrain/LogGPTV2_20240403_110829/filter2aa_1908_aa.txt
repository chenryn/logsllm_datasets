Executive Summary 
The Executive Order (14028) on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity directs the Department of 
Commerce, in coordination with the National Telecommunications and Information 
Administration (NTIA), to publish the “minimum elements” for a Software Bill of Materials 
(SBOM). An SBOM is a formal record containing the details and supply chain relationships of 
various components used in building software. In addition to establishing these minimum 
elements, this report defines the scope of how to think about minimum elements, describes 
SBOM use cases for greater transparency in the software supply chain, and lays out options for 
future evolution.  
An SBOM provides those who produce, purchase, and operate software with information that 
enhances their understanding of the supply chain, which enables multiple benefits, most notably 
the potential to track known and newly emerged vulnerabilities and risks. SBOM will not solve 
all software security problems, but will form a foundational data layer on which further security 
tools, practices, and assurances can be built. The minimum elements as defined in this document 
are the essential pieces that support basic SBOM functionality and will serve as the foundation 
for an evolving approach to software transparency. These minimum elements comprise three 
broad, interrelated areas. 
Minimum Elements 
Data Fields 
Document baseline information about each component that should 
be tracked: Supplier, Component Name, Version of the Component, 
Other Unique Identifiers, Dependency Relationship, Author of 
SBOM Data, and Timestamp. 
Automation Support 
Support automation, including via automatic generation and 
machine-readability to allow for scaling across the software 
ecosystem. Data formats used to generate and consume SBOMs 
include SPDX, CycloneDX, and SWID tags. 
Practices and 
Processes 
Define the operations of SBOM requests, generation and use 
including: Frequency, Depth, Known Unknowns, Distribution and 
Delivery, Access Control, and Accommodation of Mistakes.  
This document identifies minimum elements that will enable basic use cases, such as 
management of vulnerabilities, software inventory, and licenses. It also looks forward, beginning 
a conversation on recommended SBOM features and advances beyond the minimum elements 
that may be seen as priorities for further work. This includes key security features such as SBOM 
integrity, as well as tracking more detailed supply chain data. As additional SBOM elements 
become feasible, tested, and built into tools, they will enable broader use cases. Some of these 
aspirational elements are being implemented today or have already shown great potential.  
The Administration has identified SBOM as a priority to drive software assurance and supply 
chain risk management, and starting today is better than waiting for perfection. Following the 
publication of this report, next steps include the development of guidance for providing an

SBOM to software purchasers, as directed by the Executive Order, as well as continued 
collaboration and public-private partnerships to refine and operationalize SBOM work.

Background 
On May 12, 2021, the President issued Executive Order (EO) 14028 on Improving the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity.1 The order focuses on modernizing cybersecurity defenses by: protecting Federal 
networks, improving information sharing between the U.S. Government and the private sector on 
cyber issues, and strengthening the United States’ ability to respond to incidents when they 
occur. Among numerous other taskings, it directed the Secretary of Commerce, in coordination 
with the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information and the Administrator of the 
National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), to publish minimum 
elements for a software bill of materials (SBOM) within 60 days of the order. 
NTIA has been focusing on this issue since 2018, when it convened an open, transparent multi-
stakeholder process on software component transparency. NTIA acted as a convener and a 
neutral facilitator, bringing together experts from around the world that represented multiple 
sectors and perspectives in the software ecosystem. The resulting resources were drafted by 
stakeholders, with frequent opportunities for the community to weigh in as the deliverables took 
form. The documentation from that process provided valuable insight and background material 
for this activity to propose the minimum elements of an SBOM as directed by EO 14028. 
The Case for Transparency 
The Administration notes in the EO, “the trust we place in our digital infrastructure should be 
proportional to how trustworthy and transparent that infrastructure is.”2 In the modern world, 
software systems involve complex, dynamic — and, too often, obscure — supply chains. 
Bringing transparency to the components and connections within and across supply chains is 
important to discovering and addressing the weak links in those chains. SBOMs are a critical 
step toward securing the software supply chain. Without them, a lack of transparency into the 
contributors, composition, and functionality of these systems contributes substantially to 
cybersecurity risks and increases costs of development, procurement, and maintenance. 
Transparency is best achieved using an understandable model supported by industry. An SBOM 
model achieves this systematic sharing by tracking component metadata, enabling mapping to 
other sources of information, and tying the metadata to software as it moves down the supply 
chain and is deployed. To scale this model globally, it is necessary to address the problem of 
universally identifying and defining certain aspects of software components to allow the data to 
be effectively and efficiently consumed by downstream users.3

Identification of software components is central to SBOM, providing visibility and awareness. 
SBOM data can be used for specific purposes, from simple (e.g. mapping to vulnerability 
database) to complex (e.g. ongoing monitoring of an included OSS package for specifically 
defined threats by correlating and analyzing multiple data sources). In both cases, external data 
may still be needed. The SBOM is the necessary glue to allow the relevant external data to be 
mapped to the software products in question.  
An SBOM is useful to those who produce, purchase, and operate software. It enables an 
understanding of the software ecosystem and provides benefits across multiple use cases and 
users.4 Among these are the use of SBOMs for inventory, vulnerability, and license management 
by producers and operators, and risk evaluation (license and vulnerability analysis) by 
purchasers.  
SBOMs offer advantages to producers such as ensuring that components are up to date and 
allowing a quick response to new vulnerabilities. SBOMs also offer benefits beyond security 
such assupporting greater efficiency and effectiveness through visibility, which in turn enables 
prioritization and better management. For example, they assist the producer with knowing and 
complying with license obligations. 
In the use case of vulnerability management, SBOM data helps producers and operators more 
quickly and accurately assess the risk associated with a newly uncovered vulnerability by 
providing transparency across dependencies within the software ecosystem. As such, it improves 
both vulnerability identification and the speed of response. 
Understanding the software supply chain, obtaining comprehensive SBOM data across software 
components, and using it to identify and analyze known vulnerabilities and potential mitigations 
are crucial in managing risk. This can only be realized with machine-readable SBOMs 
supporting automation and tool integration, and the ability for applications to query and process 
this data.  
III. Scope  
This document establishes the “minimum elements” of an SBOM. These minimum elements will 
establish the baseline technology and practices for the provisioning of SBOMs and are deemed 
necessary to achieve the goals expressed in Executive Order 14028. This document also reviews

how these basics can be expanded upon and offers some guidance on the tension between having 
a predictable SBOM format and the need for flexibility, depending on the technology in question 
and the needs of consumers.  
SBOMs alone will not address the multitude of software supply chain and software assurance 
concerns faced by the ecosystem today.5 It is a necessary cliché to acknowledge that there are no 
cybersecurity panaceas, and SBOM is no exception. As noted above, SBOMs can facilitate better 
and faster responses to known vulnerabilities. The number of known vulnerabilities for a given 
piece of software is a function of its install base, the research community, and the supplier’s 
disclosure process and product security team. More disclosed vulnerabilities may mean the 
software is less risky to use, since this means that researchers are paying attention and the 
supplier is managing the disclosure process. 
SBOM is a starting point that builds on identified vulnerabilities. The minimum elements that are 
deemed feasible in today’s environment do not capture the full range of metadata around 
software source, processing, and use that is likely to emerge from modern software processes. 
Some of this data will be incorporated into future extensions of SBOM data. At the same time, 
SBOMs will not be the sole resource or mechanism for supply chain security or software 
assurance. Other data is quite valuable for a range of use cases, but should be considered as 
separate and complementary to SBOM. Rather than treat the SBOM as a single model for all 
assurance and software supply chain data, a linkable, modular approach is encouraged to 
maximize the potential for flexibility and adoption. Linkability enables SBOM data to be easily 
mapped to other important supply chain data, while a modular architecture supports extensibility 
for more use cases as software supply chain transparency and management data and tools 
mature. 
Certain key points of the software supply chain discussion are out of scope of this report, 
including the question of regulatory and procurement requirements. The minimum elements 
should not be interpreted to create new federal requirements. The potential benefits of 
centralizing or pooling SBOM data for operations, threat intelligence or research has not been 
addressed. Lastly, the “software” in the “Software Bill of Materials” naturally limits 
considerations of hardware. While software embedded in hardware and devices is certainly in 
scope, the key supply chain and security issue pertaining to hardware is distinct and complex 
enough to deserve its own treatment.  
Finally, nothing in this document should be seen to limit SBOM use or constrain the innovation 
and exploration occurring across the software ecosystem today. These minimum elements are the

starting point. Broadly speaking, this document represents a key, initial step in the SBOM 
process that will advance and mature over time. 
IV. Minimum Elements  
The minimum constituent parts of an overall SBOM – referred to as elements – are three broad, 
inter-related areas. These elements will enable an evolving approach to software transparency, 
capturing both the technology and the functional operation. Subsequent efforts will certainly 
incorporate more detail or technical advances. As noted above, these are the minimum at this 
point; organizations and agencies may ask for more, and the capabilities for transparency in the 
software supply chain may improve and evolve over time. (See “Future of SBOM” below) 
These three categories of elements are: 
• Data Fields 
• Automation Support 
• Practices and Processes 
A piece of software can be represented as a hierarchical tree, made up of components that can, in 
turn, have subcomponents, and so on. Components are often “third party,” from another source, 
but might also be “first party,” that is, from the same supplier but able to be uniquely identified 
as a freestanding, trackable unit of software. Each component should have its own SBOM listing 
their components, building the hierarchical tree. The data fields apply to each component, which 
are, in turn, encoded with tools and formats for automation support following the defined 
practices and processes.
