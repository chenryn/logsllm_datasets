User: You need to set up a GitLab server within the company for code warehouse management and continuous integration. Please provide a detailed deployment plan, including hardware, operating system, database, GitLab version, configuration, etc.
Assistant: 1. Hardware The GitLab server needs certain hardware configurations to run normally. It is recommended to configure at least 4-core CPU, 8GB memory, and 100GB hard disk space. 2. Operating system GitLab supports running on multiple operating systems, such as Ubuntu, CentOS, etc. Here we take CentOS 7 as an example for illustration. 3. Database GitLab uses PostgreSQL as the default database. Before installing GitLab, a PostgreSQL database needs to be installed on the server. The installation method can be installed through the yum command, or downloaded from the official website to install the source code. 4. For the GitLab version, you can choose to obtain the installation package from the GitLab official website, or you can install it through yum on the command line. It is recommended to download the latest version of GitLab. 5. Configuration Before installing GitLab, you need to set some environment variables and software dependencies. The following are some commonly used settings: - Turn off the firewall or set firewall rules so that the GitLab server can be accessed externally. - Install necessary tools such as curl, vim, etc. - Install necessary software extensions such as ImageMagick, Nokogiri, etc. - Configure mail server for sending mail notifications. - Configure LDAP, SAML, etc. to implement user authentication and authorization. The installation steps are as follows: 1. To configure the yum source, you need to configure the yum source of GitLab first in order to install the latest version. You can set it according to the method provided on the official website: curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash 2. Install GitLab After completing the yum source configuration, use the following Command to install GitLab: sudo yum install gitlab-ee 3. Configure GitLab After the installation is complete, you need to configure GitLab. Here we take the default configuration as an example, no changes are required. 4. Start GitLab Start the GitLab service: sudo gitlab-ctl start 5. Access GitLab After the startup is complete, enter the IP address or domain name of the GitLab server in a web browser, and log in to GitLab to configure. 6. Integrate continuous integration services In addition to Git warehouse management, GitLab can also be used for continuous integration. Can integrate GitLab Runner or other software, such as Jenkins, etc., to realize automated deployment and testing. For specific steps, please refer to the GitLab documentation. The above is a detailed deployment plan for building a GitLab server within the company.
