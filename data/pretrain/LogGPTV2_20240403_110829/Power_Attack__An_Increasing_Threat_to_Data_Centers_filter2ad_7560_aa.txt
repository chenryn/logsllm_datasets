Abstract— Entering the era of cloud computing, data centers
are scaling in a fast pace. However, as the increasing number
of servers being deployed in data centers, the data center power
distribution systems have already approached peak capacities.
Since the upgrades of the power systems are extremely expensive,
power oversubscription has become a trend in modern data
centers as a cost-effective way to handle power provisioning.
Under benign workload of data centers, power oversubscription
works well as servers rarely peak simultaneously. However, power
oversubscription makes data centers vulnerable to malicious
workload that can generate power spikes on multiple servers at
the same time, which may cause branch circuit breakers to trip
and lead to undesired power outages. In this paper, we introduce
a new security concept called power attack and exploit the attack
vectors in platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service
(IaaS), and software as a service (SaaS) cloud environments,
respectively. To demonstrate the feasibility of launching a power
attack, we conduct series of hardware experiments and data-
center-level simulations. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis on
how different power management methods can affect a power
attack and how to mitigate such an attack. Our experimental
results and analysis show that power attacks will pose a serious
threat to modern data centers and should be taken into account
while deploying new high-density servers and power management
techniques.

INTRODUCTION
With the ever-increasing demand of cloud services, data
centers have experienced signiﬁcant growth in their scale. The
number of servers in data centers has surged from 24 million
in 2008 to over 35 million in 2012 [5]. Correspondingly,
the power consumption of data centers has increased by 56
percent from 2005 to 2010 [22], with an even faster speed in
recent years. Thus, the rapid server deployment in data centers
has caused their power distribution and cooling systems to
approach peak capacity [14]. However, it is very expensive
to upgrade the power infrastructures of data centers and the
related cost is commonly in hundreds of millions of dollars.
To support more servers with the existing power infras-
tructures, power oversubscription has become a trend in data
centers [12], [27], [17]. The key feature of oversubscription

if all
is to place more servers on the power infrastructure of a
data center than it can support
the servers would
not reach their maximum power consumption at the same
time. Since servers rarely peak simultaneously with normal
workloads, oversubscription allows many more servers to be
hosted than traditional provisioning that relies on the server
nameplate power ratings, without the need of upgrading the
power infrastructure. However, power oversubscription makes
it a possibility that the power consumption of servers might
exceed power capacity, resulting in an increasing risk of power
outages.
From the security perspective, this hidden risk induced by
power oversubscription leaves data centers vulnerable to ma-
licious workloads that can generate power spikes on multiple
servers at the same time. We deﬁne the creation of such a
malicious workload as a power attack. Without obtaining a
privileged access, an attacker can launch a power attack as a
regular user. The simultaneously occurred power peaks could
produce the overloading of electrical circuits and then trigger
the trip of circuit breakers (CBs) at the rack level or even a
higher level of power facilities, leading to undesired power
outages. The ultimate goal of a power attack is to fail the
victim’s power facility and cause an interruption or termination
of the computing services running on the blackout servers.
The damage of a power attack is twofold: both cloud service
providers and the owners of other computing services running
on the blackout servers suffer from service interruptions and
ﬁnancial losses.
In this paper, we systematically investigate the feasibility
of launching power attacks in three main-stream cloud service
business models: platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as
a service (IaaS), and software as a service (SaaS), respectively.
In the case of PaaS, we choose high performance computing
(HPC) as one of its typical workloads, and conduct a set of
experiments based on HPC benchmarks. We observe that an
attacker can generate power spikes by adjusting workloads
but those system-utilization-based load balancing mechanisms
can hardly detect such an attack. In the case of IaaS, we
introduce a new concept called parasite attacks that leverage
controlled virtual machines (VMs) to signiﬁcantly increase the
power consumption of the host physical machine. Moreover,
we demonstrate that VM migration can trigger high power
spikes by conducting a set of experiments. If the VM migration
routine can be inferred by attackers, the power spikes generated
during migration can be exploited to help trip the CBs. In the
case of SaaS, we use web services as its typical workload
and conduct a set of experiments to demonstrate that specially
crafted web requests can trigger power spikes and consequently
infrastructure against electrical faults, the switchgear is nor-
mally equipped with a circuit breaker (CB) that would trip
if the total power consumption of the data center exceeds
its rated capacity. Each UPS supplies a series of Power
Distribution Units (PDUs), which are rated on the order of
75-200 kW each. A PDU breaks up the incoming power feed
into multiple branch circuits and has a breaker panel where
circuit breakers protect individual circuits from ground short
or power overload. The PDUs further transform the voltage to
support a group of server racks. It is important to note that
many components in a data center power system have limited
capacities. For example, a PDU can generally handle 75-225
kW of load and a rack-level branch circuit typically has a
capacity of 6 kW [6]. Violating such capacities may cause
circuit breakers to trip, leading to the shutdown of the servers
connected to a branch circuit or even the entire data center.
A typical 1 MW data center may house ten or more PDUs.
Each PDU can support approximately 20 to 60 racks while
each rack can include about 10 to 80 computer servers [36].
As mentioned before, many data centers keep deploying
new high-density servers (e.g., blade servers) to support their
rapidly growing business. As a result, their power distribution
systems have already approached the peak capacity. In order
to minimize the high capital expenses of upgrading their
power infrastructures, data centers recently started to adopt
power oversubscription as an important methodology to fully
utilize their existing power infrastructures [6]. For example,
Google, HP, and IBM researchers have proposed various ways
to implement power oversubscription in data centers [12],
[27], [17]. Google recently conducts analysis on three kinds
of workload traces they collected from real data centers:
search, webmail, and MapReduce [12]. Their study shows
that the peak power is as high as 96% of the rated capacity
at the rack level, but much lower (72%) at the data center
level, because the power consumption of different racks rarely
peak simultaneously. Therefore, they conclude that there is a
substantial oversubscription opportunity, which would allow
38% more servers to be safely hosted in their existing data
center, without spending a huge amount of money to either
upgrade the power infrastructure or build new data centers.
It is important to note that traditional data centers com-
monly adopt a conservative provisioning methodology to host
servers based on their nameplate power rating and thus have
very small probability for power overloading. However, today’s
data centers increasingly rely on power oversubscription to
avoid or defer the costly power infrastructure upgrades, which
signiﬁcantly increases the opportunity of having undesired
power capacity violations.
As we can see, a strong assumption made for power over-
subscription is that the power consumption of most racks or
PDUs in the data center never peak at the same time, which has
been demonstrated to be valid with normal data center work-
loads in numerous studies (e.g., [6], [12], [15]). Unfortunately,
an unsafe implementation of power oversubscription could lead
to a serious vulnerability for data centers, e.g., a malicious
attacker may manipulate many servers to have their power
peak simultaneously, which can then lead to the violation of
some rated power capacities in a data center. As a result, the
overloading of electrical circuits could trigger branch circuit

trip the CBs.
Based on our rack-level experimental results, we further
conduct a series of data-center-level simulations by using
traces and conﬁgurations of the Google’s data center at Lenoir,
North Carolina, USA. The simulation results show that by
injecting malicious workload, an attacker can generate power
spikes in a data center scale, which pose a serious threat to the
availability and reliability of data centers. While the focus of
this work is on the attacking side, we also present different
approaches to mitigate the power attacks in an effective
manner.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section
II introduces the background of power infrastructures in a
data center. Section III presents our threat model of power
attacks. Sections IV, V, and VI present how to launch a
power attack in the PaaS environments, IaaS environments, and
SaaS environments, respectively. Section VII shows the data
center level simulation results. Section VIII provides a detailed
discussion on how some new power management techniques
will affect power attacks. Section IX presents the defense
against power attacks. Section X surveys related work, and
ﬁnally Section XI draws the conclusion.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce a typical power infrastructure
employed in most data centers. We then discuss the practice
of power oversubscription in data centers for cost reduction
and its implications on the power security of data centers.
Today’s data centers commonly have a three-tier power dis-
tribution infrastructure to support hosted computer servers [6],
though the exact architecture may vary for different sites.
Figure 1 shows a simpliﬁed illustration of the three-tier hierar-
chy in a typical data center. High-voltage power (60-400 kV)
from the utility grid is scaled to medium voltage (typically
10-20 kV) through an outside transformer and then fed to
an Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS). The ATS connects to
both the utility power grid and on-site power (e.g., diesel)
generators. From the ATS,
the primary switchgear of the
data center scales the voltage down to 400-600 V, which is
supplied to Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) via multiple
independent routes for fault tolerance. To protect the power

breakers to trip, leading to undesired outages and then the
disruption of important services. To prevent undesired power
overload, the power consumption of each rack enclosure, each
Power Distribution Unit (PDU), and the entire data center
must be carefully provisioned and then properly controlled
at runtime, in order to stay below the desired power limits
at each level [36]. With the pervasion of outsourcing cloud
services such as infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as
a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS), the workload
of the data center will be impacted severely by the cloud
service users. When all the users of cloud services are benign,
the workload of a data center will follow the normal pattern
and power oversubscription can be applied safely. However,
an adversary can gain access to data center resources and
make changes to workload easily. By deliberately adjusting the
workload of the servers within a rack, an adversary can make
all servers reach power peaks simultaneously and the circuit
breaker might be tripped. Moreover, a more advanced attacker
may even generate power spikes in servers within same PDU
or even UPS to cause higher level utility failure.
In this paper, we will demonstrate how an adversary can
generate power spikes in three main-stream cloud business
models, PaaS, IaaS and SaaS, respectively. Our observations
and experiments will prove that current power management
strategies in a data center will face the serious threat of a
power attack.
III. THREAT MODEL
In this section, we describe the threat model of power
attacks. In particular, we present the reasonable assumptions
we made for the study of power attacks.
The target of a power attack can be a rack, a PDU, or
even the entire data center, and we assume that the victim has
the following conﬁguration features. (1) The target is running
certain cloud services that are available to public. The target
can run IaaS, PaaS and SaaS, and any users including an
attacker can subscribe the services. (2) The target data center
deploys power oversubscription as its power management
solutions. (3) The target data center monitors and manages
power consumption at the rack or PDU level. In a large data
center, it is very difﬁcult to monitor power consumption of
all servers in a very ﬁne-grained manner. And the accurate
power sampling for thousands or tens of thousands servers will
induce high overhead [24]. Therefore, power monitoring is at
the rack or PDU level, instead of the server level. (4) The target
data center performs certain routines such as virtual machine
migration and deploys basic load balancing systems.
The adversary who launches a power attack could be
an individual hacker, a botnet master, a competing cloud
service provider, or an organization for committing cyber-
crime/cyberwarfare. However, we assume that the attacker is
always from outside. The resources and capabilities of the
attacker has are detailed as follows. (1) The attacker commu-
nicates with the target via the public service interface provided
by the cloud. The attacker accesses the target as a regular user,
and no additional privilege is available to the attacker. (2) The
attacker has sufﬁcient resources to launch a large scale attack.
The attacker has the capability of subscribing the target’s
service with a large number of user accounts and generating
a large amount of malicious workload/requests to the target.
(3) The attacker can infer internal information of the target by
exploiting certain probing techniques. Some network probing
tools have been leveraged to infer the physical topology of
a data center [29], revealing the connection between the IP
address of a machine and its physical location, as well as
verifying if two VMs reside in the same physical machine.
Moreover, for easy management, normally data center admin-
istrators place the servers that provide the computing services
for the same enterprise or group of users in the same rack.
Also, the IP addresses of the physical machines that connect to
the same rack share the same network ID and hence are close
to each other. Therefore, we assume that the attacker is able
to approximately locate the target machines that are within the
same rack or PDU1. On the other hand, to successfully launch
a power attack at the rack level, it is not required to pinpoint
all these servers belong to the same sack. As long as attackers
know one target and its IP address, they could simply launch
a mini brute-force attack by injecting malicious workloads to
a range of IP addresses, which cover the target and most of
the other machines in the same rack.
The process of launching a power attack is also the process
of consuming the services provided by the target, and the
attacker must pay for the computing services. Thus, there is
a cost related to launch a power attack. However, the damage
caused by a power attack could be catastrophic. Once a CB
is tripped, all servers connected will be blacked out and all
services running will be interrupted. Such damage is much
more severe than that caused by traditional attacks such as
DoS attacks. Therefore, for those attackers who commit a
cybercrime or cyberwarfare, we assume that they have a strong
motivation and rich resources to launch a power attack.
In different cloud environments, the attacker has different
control over the target’s computing resources and services.
For instance, in IaaS, the attacker can obtain the full control
over owned virtual machines. But in SaaS, the attacker can
only access the target by issuing network requests. Therefore,
the key technical challenge of launching a power attack is
how to construct effective attack vectors in different cloud
environments, i.e., how to generate more power consumption
of the target in different circumstances. In the following three
sections, we detail the attack vectors in three main-stream
cloud business models, PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS, respectively.
IV. POWER ATTACK IN PAAS
In this section, we investigate the attack vectors in PaaS
environments and design corresponding experiments to evalu-
ate the power attacks. Based on the experimental results, we
further conduct damage assessment and analysis.
A. PaaS and attack vectors
Platform as a service (PaaS) provides computing platform
to users. The service vendor will manage the hard devices,
OS, and middleware, but users can customize the applications
running on the platform. With PaaS, application developers are
