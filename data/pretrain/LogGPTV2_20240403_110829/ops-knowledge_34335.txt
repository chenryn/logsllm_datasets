Assistant: This log chunk shows a system going through various processes, such as scanning, configuring, and waking up. It also shows the system connecting to various components, such as USBMSC, AirPort_Brcm43xx, and AppleCamIn. Additionally, it shows the system setting up keepalive intervals and thermal and memory pressure states.
