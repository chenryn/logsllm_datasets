User: In order to improve application performance, caching technology can be used. Please provide a caching design solution for e-commerce platforms, including caching strategies, tool selection, etc.
Assistant: Cache design scheme for e-commerce platform: 1. Cache strategy (1) Cache data classification is divided into three levels according to data importance and access frequency: high, medium, and low, and different cache strategies are adopted. High-level data: use the cache directly, update in real time, and set the data cache time to short. Medium-level data: use the cache database, and set the data cache time to medium. Low-level data: read directly from the database without caching. (2) Cache update strategy When data is updated, the strategy of first updating the cache and then updating the database is adopted, which can ensure the real-time performance of the system. 2. Tool selection (1) Redis Redis is a high-performance distributed memory database that supports multiple data types and can be used for caching. It has the advantages of fast, stable and high availability. (2) Memcached Memcached is a distributed memory object cache system that can store data in the form of key-value pairs. It is easy to use and has high performance, suitable for storing and reading some data. (3) Ehcache Ehcache is an open source Java distributed cache framework that supports multiple cache strategies, including FIFO, LFU, LRU, etc., and can set appropriate cache strategies according to data conditions, which has the advantages of high efficiency and reliability. In summary, in order to improve application performance, caching technology can be used. For e-commerce platforms, caching tools such as Redis, Memcached, and Ehcache can be used to adopt different caching strategies according to the importance of data and access frequency, and update the cache first. Then update the database policy.
