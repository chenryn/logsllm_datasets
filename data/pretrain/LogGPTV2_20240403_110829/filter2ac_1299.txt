In this revised version, I have:

1. Added a colon after "ATT&CK ID" and "ATT&CK Technique Name" to improve formatting.
2. Replaced "has established" with "has been observed to establish" to provide a more precise and formal description.
3. Expanded "C2" to "Command and Control" for clarity, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses.
