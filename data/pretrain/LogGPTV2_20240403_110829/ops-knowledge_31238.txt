To determine the mode of the log, let's first understand its structure and content. The log entry you provided is:

```
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: 10.251.73.220:50010 is added to blk_7128370237687728475 size 67108864
```

The log indicates that a block has been added to the `blockMap` in the `NameSystem`. The key components are:
- **IP Address and Port**: `10.251.73.220:50010`
- **Block ID**: `blk_7128370237687728475`
- **Block Size**: `67108864` (in bytes)

Given this, the log is in the following format:

```
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP:Port> is added to blk_<BlockID> size <BlockSize>
```

To generalize this log entry, we can use placeholders for the specific values:

```
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP:Port> is added to blk_<BlockID> size <BlockSize>
```

In your example, the placeholders would be:
- `<IP:Port>`: `10.251.73.220:50010`
- `<BlockID>`: `7128370237687728475`
- `<BlockSize>`: `67108864`

Thus, the generalized log format is:

```
BLOCK* NameSystem.addStoredBlock: blockMap updated: <IP:Port> is added to blk_<BlockID> size <BlockSize>
```

This format clearly indicates that a new block has been added to the `blockMap` with the specified IP address, port, block ID, and block size.
