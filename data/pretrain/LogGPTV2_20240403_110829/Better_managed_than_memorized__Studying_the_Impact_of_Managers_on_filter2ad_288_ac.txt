Privacy Segmentation Index [42] (Q1 in Appendix A) to
capture our participants’ general privacy attitudes (i.e.,
fundamentalists, pragmatists, unconcerned). We further
added two questions speciﬁcally about our participants’
attitude about passwords (see Q4 in Appendix A), e.g., if
passwords are considered a futile protection mechanism
or important for privacy protection. Table 3 summarizes
the results of those questions. Only a minority of 86 of
our survey participants are privacy unconcerned and the
majority of 365 participants believe in the importance of
passwords as a security measure. Almost a third of our
survey participants experienced a password leak in the
past. For our study we sampled in almost equal parts from
those different groups. Using a Mann-Whitney rank test,
we could not ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the survey and study participants’ distribution
of privacy and password attitudes/experiences. Thus, we
argue that the risk of an opt-in bias towards either end of
the spectrum for privacy and password attitude is unlikely.

4.2 General password statistics
Tables 4 and 5 provide summary statistics of all pass-
words collected by our plugin. We collected from our 170
participants 1,045 unique passwords and 1,767 password
entries in total. That means, that our average participant
entered passwords to 10.39 distinct domains with a stan-
dard deviation of 5.52 and median of 9. Our participants
reported using on average 29.95 password-secured ac-
counts (Q2 in Appendix A) and we collected on average
61% of each participant’s self-estimated number5 of pass-
words. The lowest number of domains per participant is
1 and the highest is 27, where the 1st quartile is 6 and
the 3rd quartile is 14. Those numbers are hence slightly
lower than those reported in related studies [51]. When
considering only unique passwords, our average partic-
ipant has 6.15 passwords, indicating that passwords are
reused frequently. Our participants entered their pass-
words on average with 2.24 different methods. Looking at
all passwords, our participants reused on average 70.56%
of their passwords, where exact-and-partial reuse is most
common with 36.46% of all passwords. Interestingly the
minimum and maximum in all reuse categories is 0% and
100%, respectively, meaning that we have participants
that did not reuse any of their passwords as well as par-
ticipants that reused all of their passwords. The average
password in our dataset had a length of 9.61 and was
composed of 2.52 character classes. The average zxcvbn
score was 2.20, where the participant with the weakest
passwords had an average of 0.67 and the participant with
the strongest an average of 4.00. Like prior work [66],
we observe a signiﬁcant correlation between password
strength and reuse (chi-square test: χ2= 75.48, p< .001).
As shown in Table 5, the majority of the 1,767 logged
passwords was entered with Chrome auto-ﬁll (53.71%)
followed by manual entry (33.39%). Although in our
pilot study various password manager plugins, e.g., Kee-
Pass and 1Password, had been correctly detected, in our
actual study only LastPass was used by our participants.

Table 5: No. of password entries with each entry method.
Of all passwords, 128 (7.24%) were entered with Last-
Pass, which is a similar share of managers as in recent re-
ports [46]. Copy&paste and unknown plugins formed the
smallest, relevant-sized shares and only four passwords
were entered programmatically by an external program.
With respect to general password reuse (see Figure 4),
partial-and-exact reuse is by far the most common reuse
across all entry methods, except for LastPass’ plugin and
Copy&paste, which have a noticeably high fraction of
non-reused passwords (e.g., 68 or 53% of all passwords
entered with LastPass were not reused) and have notice-
ably less password reuse than the overall average. Look-
ing at the password strength for all unique passwords (see
