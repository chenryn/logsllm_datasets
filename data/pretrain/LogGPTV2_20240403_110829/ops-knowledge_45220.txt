User: I am very new to linux, and i want to learn scripting. It seems like there are quite a few options to learn about scripting from bash shell scripting, python, perl lisp, and probably more that i dont know about. I am just wonder what are the  the advantage and disadvantage of all of them, and what would be a good place to start?
Assistant: I think a lot of times, people new to programming see all the options out there and don't know where to start.  You listed a bunch of different languages in your post.  My advice would be to pick one of those languages and find a book or tutorial and work through it.
I became interested in "scripting" from just trying to come up with a mIRC script that would fit my needs; however, after completing that, I changed OS from windows to Linux and mIRC scripting no longer would work for me.  So I started playing with Perl and Python to see which would work best for xChat.  
Eventually, what it all boils down with is that you'll need to experiment with a language and do some hands on learning.  I eventually completed project, and used PHP for it. While completing that, I also was working through Michael Hartl's tutorial and worked with Ruby on Rails some.  Now I'm in the process of rewriting it using Node.js (javascript). 
Best bet, just pick one language and start playing with it.
