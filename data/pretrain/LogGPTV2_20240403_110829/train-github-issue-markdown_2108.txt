### Problem description
By default all IE browsers > 10 show a clear icon for text input when any
value is entered. Normally the icon has the same height as the input element.
With Material-UI the input element is far higher than the actual text, so the
demo page http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/text-field  
results in the following ugly appearance in IE:

According to Microsoft document https://support.microsoft.com/en-
us/kb/2813492, the clear icon can be disabled by adding a style for the IE-
specific pseudo element like:
`input::-ms-clear { display: none; }`
I think there should by default be a conditional rendering of this css for the
TextField for a consistent looking across browsers.
