Question: "Consider the security measures Apple implements to protect user data on iOS devices. If an attacker gains physical access to an encrypted backup of an iOS device, which of the following factors would most likely contribute to the security of the data against brute-force attacks?"
 "A": "The keybag is protected with a simple four-digit backup password, which is run through 1,000 iterations of the key derivation function PBKDF2."
 "B": "The keybag is protected with a strong, complex password and is processed through 10 million iterations of the key derivation function PBKDF2."
 "C": "The backup keybag is created with a new set of keys for each backup, but the data is not re-encrypted, allowing for faster backup creation."
 "D": "The UID-derived key wrapping non-migratory keychain items is maintained during backups, which prevents data access on a different device."
