Assessing land use and land use change 12
Collect Earth will automatically launch Google Earth. Collect Earth together with Google Earth provide an
easy way to systematically review satellite imagery and assess land use. Collect Earth organizes sampling
plots for Papua New Guinea in sub-national units arranged along a 4° grid (WGS 1984 datum). Data for each
of the country’s 20 provinces are saved in separate Collect Earth Data (CED) files.
3.1.1 Adding Collect Earth data files
In the Places panel on the left, notice the Collect Earth Data folder contains PNG Land Use survey samples
from Hela Province along a 4° x 4° grid. To begin entering data for a different province, return to the main
Collect Earth window and select Properties under the Tools tab.

In the Places panel, the first number listed beside each plot is province-specific. All PNG provinces will have
a plot number 1. In contrast, the plot ID# is a unique identifier nation-wide. The first plot in West Sepik has a
unique ID# of 33092, which will not be duplicated in any other province of the country.
Double-click on plot ID#33092 to zoom to its location. Then click anywhere within the plot boundaries. The
Collect Earth dialogue box will appear.
Two additional windows will open presenting the same location in Bing Maps and Google Earth Engine.
More information on these supporting software tools is provided in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.

3.1.2 Entering land use data
Use the Collect Earth dialogue box to enter land use
information for the plot.
Land use classification schemes vary by country. To
facilitate national reporting to the UNFCCC, the
country-specific versions of Collect Earth present land
use classes through a land representation framework
recommended by the IPCC. This framework outlines
six main land use categories that more detailed land
use sub-divisions will fall within.
Land use sub-categories indicate the conversions from
one land use to another. The year of the change is
significant for interpreting land use change dynamics
and estimating emissions from land use change.
The Land use sub-divisions are detailed land use
classes that more closely represent realities within a
country or an area of interest.
The Accuracy options allow users to indicate their level
of certainty with their selections. Accuracy is a
required field in the land use category, land use sub-
category and land use sub-divisions sections.
The Canopy options include quantitative and
qualitative descriptions of forest canopy cover. The
cover percentage can be calculated from the ratio of
plot points under canopy cover to the total number of
plot sampling points (25). Uncertainty may arise where
no high spatial resolution imagery is available for the
plot area. If uncertain, select No under the accuracy
option.
Volume II: Collect Earth User Manual for Windows OS

The Site description contains information related to
accessibility and elements located within the sampling
plot.
If any of the listed elements are found within a plot,
indicate the percentage of the plot that it comprises.
If Human impact in the plot is apparent, indicate the
type, accuracy, grade (or level) and the first year the
human impact became apparent within the historical
satellite imagery of plot.
Under RS Data, select the type of satellite imagery that
was used to assign the sampling plot to one of the six
basic land use categories. The imagery used should be
the most recent imagery available that is of sufficient
spatial resolution to assess land use.
Click Submit and Validate to save the data you have
entered.
In the Google Earth Places panel, a red exclamation
mark appears beside plots without data. The
exclamation mark turns yellow when data is entered
but not saved. A green check appears once the data
has been submitted and validated.
Collect Earth can be customized to suit different country-specific or program-specific classification schemes.
The data entry prompts (above) within Collect Earth will vary accordingly.

3.1.4 Exporting Collect Earth data
Collect Earth data files can be exported as CSV, XML and Fusion Table files. Collect Earth Fusion Table files
are a special type of CSV file that is preformatted to be compatible with Google’s Fusion Table application.
Click on Data Import/Export in the Tools menu, and
select Export data to CSV. Name and save the file.
The CSV file, which can be opened in Excel, tabulates all of the data that has been entered in Collect Earth,
including data that has not been actively saved and validated. Some metadata are also provided, such as the
plot coordinates and the operator name.
Data Export to Fusion Table also generates a CSV
file, but it differs from the one above in that it
contains an additional column with the complete
coordinates of each plot.
3.1.5 Backing up Collect Earth data
Export Collect Earth data to XML to back up the database. XML is the only format that is configured to save
Collect Earth metadata in addition to the data manually entered by users. Click on Data Import/Export in the
Tools menu, and select Export
data to XML (Zipped). Name and
save the file. The command for
importing data from XML is
located in the same Tools menu.

3.2 Navigating and organizing with Google Earth
3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4
Collect Earth Google Earth Bing Maps Google Earth Engine
Google Earth serves as the main interface for Collect Earth software. Adjusting certain settings and
familiarizing yourself with the basic functionality of Google Earth can enhance the experience of using
Collect Earth. Below are a few tips.
3.2.1 Optimizing the data view
After launching Collect Earth, data from the application will appear within Google Earth’s Places Panel on the
left-hand side. The Search Panel above and the Layers Panel below will rarely be used. Minimize these
panels to display more Collect Earth data.
Click on the Search
bar and the Layers bar
to minimize these
panels.
The new view
maximizes the length
of the Places Panel,
which contains the
Collect Earth data.
3.2.2 Finding plots
Use the Find tool at the bottom of the Place Panel to search for a
particular plot. Always use the unique plot ID rather than the plot
number, which will vary by region.
Type the plot ID#. If the ID# is present within the dataset, Google Earth
will scroll to and highlight the plot.
If the ID# is not present, the search field will be highlighted in red.

3.2.3 Improving navigation
Google Earth navigation settings control the Fly-to-speed and the way you way you approach each site. The
Fly-to-speed is particularly important when working with slow internet connections. A fast fly-to-speed can
reduce the amount of time one waits for the imagery over a sight to load.
View with tilt View without tilt
Google Earth’s default navigations setting may tilt when arriving at a site. The titled view on the left makes it
difficult to clearly view all sampling points within a plot and assess land use.
Adjust the navigation settings by
clicking on Tools in the Google
Earth toolbar and then Options.
Drag the Fly-to-speed slider from
Slow to Fast.
Select Do not automatically tilt
while zooming.
Click OK to save the changes.

3.2.4 Measuring distance
Measuring distance within Google Earth can be useful for determining the plot accessibility.
Navigate to plot ID333595 and click on
the ruler in the Google Earth taskbar.
A target box will appear instead of the normal pointer arrow. Click once on the point in the center of the
plot. Then click once on the center of the road to draw a line for measurement. The length of the line will
automatically display within the Ruler box.
The unit of measurement can be changed by clicking
on the dropdown tab beside Map Length. Select
kilometers.
In the Collect Earth dialogue box, select the
approximate distance and the bearing from the plot
toward the access point. You can also type
additional details that may be helpful when planning
the ground-based forest inventory.

3.2.5 Viewing historical imagery
At the bottom of the Google Earth navigation window, the date of the imagery appears beneath the imagery
copyright year and source. Google Earth default settings present the date in MM/DD/YYYY format, but the
data format may vary with the language setting. For example Spanish and French Google Earth display data
in DD/MM/YYYY format.
Imagery date: October 30, 2010 Imagery source
Details for the most recent image used to classify land should be entered in the Collect Earth dialogue box.
Click on the clock in the Google Earth toolbar to browse historical imagery. Occasionally, more recent
imagery may also be viewed with this tool. For plot ID# 62909, imagery is available from 2014 and 2003.

3.2.6 Exporting images
When working with a team to conduct a land use classification, it is important to have a common
understanding of how various land uses will appear in satellite imagery. Google Earth imagery can be
exported in jpeg format, which may be an easier and lighter (in terms of file size) way to share views of
various land use classes.
There are two ways to export images as jpegs:
Under the Edit menu, select Copy image. The jpeg
image can then be pasted in a different program.
Alternatively, you can save the image using the File
menu.
The jpeg will contain the view from the navigation frame without the navigation tools and taskbar. The
image below is an example of a coconut plantation near a dispersed settlement in Papua New Guinea. This
land use class may be more easily recongnized if Collect Earth operators can view sample imagery before
classifying plots.

3.2.7 Adding overlays
Existing maps that may facilitate land use classification can be added in Google Earth as overlays. The
instructions below apply to maps and images without a spatial reference system. For georeferenced rasters,
see section 5.3 for guidance.
Click Add in the Google Earth taskbar and select
Image Overlay.
Type in a name for the image you will add. Then browse for and open the file. WWF New Guinea Ecoregions

3.3 Exploring new perspectives with Bing Maps
3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4
Collect Earth Google Earth Bing Maps Google Earth Engine
Bing Maps is a web mapping service provided by Microsoft. Through Bing Map, high spatial resolution
satellite imagery from Digital Globe can be viewed and used for land use assessments. Collect Earth plot
locations have been linked with Bing Maps because the latter web mapping service has a slightly different
geographic coverage. Some plots, such as plot ID#52416, have high resolution imagery in Bing Maps where
only Landsat imagery is available in Google Earth. To zoom to the plot location in Bing Map, click anywhere
within the plot in Google Earth.
In the image above, Google Earth features medium spatial resolution Landsat imagery of plot ID#52416,
while Bing maps provides high resolution Digital Global imagery over the same area. The Digital Globe
imagery makes it easier to identify the vegetation as coconut trees (agricultural land) rather than forest land.
3.4 Visualizing imagery with Google Earth Engine
3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4
Collect Earth Google Earth Bing Maps Google Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine is a web platform for processing satellite imagery and other Earth observation data.
Through its partnership with the United States Geological Survey, Google Earth Engine provides free access
to coarse, medium and high spatial resolution satellite imagery acquired over the past forty years. Various
types of pre-processed imagery can also be used for land use analysis.
One of the most useful land datasets available through Google Earth Engine is the Landsat Greenest-Pixel
top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance composite. These composites, which are available for Landsat 4, 5, 7
and 8, are created by drawing upon all images of a site for a full calendar year. The greenest pixels, with the
highest NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) value, are compiled to create a new image. These
composites are particularly useful in tropical forest areas that may be prone to frequent cloud cover.

Navigate to plot ID#62909. The historical imagery within Google Earth shows that the plot falls within an
agriculture area in December 2012. In October 2010, however, the plot was forested. Use Google Earth
Engine to determine the year of the land use conversion. To view the plot location in Google Earth Engine,
click anywhere within the plot in Google Earth.
There are two ways to add data within Google Earth Engine. If you know the name of the dataset you want
to add, being typing it in the Search field up top. Alternatively, click on Data Catalog in the upper-right
