### Assessing Land Use and Land Use Change

#### 3.1 Using Collect Earth with Google Earth

**3.1.1 Adding Collect Earth Data Files**

Collect Earth, in conjunction with Google Earth, provides a systematic method for reviewing satellite imagery and assessing land use. Collect Earth organizes sampling plots for Papua New Guinea (PNG) into sub-national units arranged along a 4° grid (WGS 1984 datum). Each of PNG's 20 provinces has its data saved in separate Collect Earth Data (CED) files.

To add a new CED file for a different province:

1. In the Places panel on the left, locate the Collect Earth Data folder, which contains PNG Land Use survey samples from Hela Province along a 4° x 4° grid.
2. Return to the main Collect Earth window and select "Properties" under the "Tools" tab.
3. Under the "Sample data" tab, click "Browse" to view the available CED files for other PNG provinces.
4. Scroll to the end of the list, select "West Sepik," and open the file.
5. Save and apply the changes.
6. To ensure Google Earth reflects the changes, click "OK" to confirm and "Yes" to reload the data within Google Earth.
7. Zoom into West Sepik province to view the new plots.

In the Places panel, each plot is identified by a province-specific number and a unique national ID. For example, the first plot in West Sepik has a unique ID# of 33092, which is not duplicated in any other province.

To zoom to a specific plot:
- Double-click on the plot ID (e.g., ID#33092) to zoom to its location.
- Click anywhere within the plot boundaries to open the Collect Earth dialogue box.
- Two additional windows will open, presenting the same location in Bing Maps and Google Earth Engine. For more information on these tools, refer to Sections 3.3 and 3.4.

#### 3.1.2 Entering Land Use Data

Use the Collect Earth dialogue box to enter land use information for the plot. The classification schemes vary by country, but Collect Earth presents land use classes through a framework recommended by the IPCC, which includes six main land use categories. More detailed sub-divisions fall within these categories.

- **Land Use Sub-Categories:** Indicate conversions from one land use to another. The year of change is crucial for interpreting land use dynamics and estimating emissions.
- **Accuracy Options:** Allow users to indicate their level of certainty with their selections. Accuracy is a required field in the land use category, sub-category, and sub-divisions sections.
- **Canopy Options:** Include quantitative and qualitative descriptions of forest canopy cover. The cover percentage can be calculated from the ratio of plot points under canopy cover to the total number of plot sampling points (25). If uncertain, select "No" under the accuracy option.
- **Site Description:** Contains information related to accessibility and elements within the sampling plot. Indicate the percentage of the plot that each element comprises.
- **Human Impact:** If apparent, specify the type, accuracy, grade, and the first year the impact became evident in historical satellite imagery.
- **RS Data:** Select the type of satellite imagery used to assign the plot to one of the six basic land use categories. Use the most recent, high-resolution imagery available.

Click "Submit and Validate" to save the entered data. In the Google Earth Places panel, a red exclamation mark appears beside plots without data, turning yellow when data is entered but not saved, and a green check appears once the data is submitted and validated.

#### 3.1.3 Modifying the Plot Layout

The plot layout, size, and spatial distribution can be customized to align with a country’s existing or planned forest inventories. In the PNG version of Collect Earth:

- Plots are arranged along a 0.04° (4.45 km) grid.
- Each plot is 100x100 meters, with an area of one hectare (10,000 square meters).
- Each plot contains 25 sample points along a 20-meter grid.

To modify the plot layout:
- In the main Collect Earth window, go to the "Plot layout" tab.
- Adjust the number of sample points, the distance between sample points, and the margin size.
- To change the distance between plots, see Section X on creating a new grid.

#### 3.1.4 Exporting Collect Earth Data

Collect Earth data files can be exported as CSV, XML, and Fusion Table files. Fusion Table files are preformatted for compatibility with Google’s Fusion Table application.

- **Export to CSV:**
  - Click on "Data Import/Export" in the Tools menu.
  - Select "Export data to CSV."
  - Name and save the file. This file can be opened in Excel and includes all entered data, including unsaved and unvalidated data, along with metadata such as plot coordinates and operator name.

- **Export to Fusion Table:**
  - Generates a CSV file with an additional column containing complete plot coordinates.

- **Backup Data:**
  - Export Collect Earth data to XML to back up the database. XML saves both user-entered data and metadata.
  - Click on "Data Import/Export" in the Tools menu, and select "Export data to XML (Zipped)."
  - Name and save the file. The command for importing data from XML is located in the same Tools menu.

#### 3.2 Navigating and Organizing with Google Earth

Google Earth serves as the main interface for Collect Earth. Adjusting settings and familiarizing yourself with Google Earth's functionality can enhance the experience.

**3.2.1 Optimizing the Data View**

- After launching Collect Earth, data appears in Google Earth’s Places Panel on the left.
- Minimize the Search Panel and Layers Panel to display more Collect Earth data.
- Click on the Search bar and Layers bar to minimize these panels, maximizing the length of the Places Panel.

**3.2.2 Finding Plots**

- Use the Find tool at the bottom of the Places Panel to search for a specific plot.
- Always use the unique plot ID rather than the plot number, which varies by region.
- Type the plot ID#. If the ID# is present, Google Earth will scroll to and highlight the plot. If not, the search field will be highlighted in red.

**3.2.3 Improving Navigation**

- Google Earth navigation settings control the Fly-to-speed and approach to each site.
- Adjust the navigation settings by clicking on "Tools" in the Google Earth toolbar, then "Options."
