4.1 Against Varying Signal Power
The reliable broadcast acknowledgment scheme described in §3
typically caters to a network of directly reachable nodes. The sig-
nal power from these clients may vary widely. Setting a single
threshold for all these clients would be difﬁcult if the received sig-
nal power of each of the subcarriers at the AP vary in a broad range.
Hence, we propose to adjust the transmission power of tone trans-
mitters/clients such that the received power of the subcarriers from
different clients at the AP are comparable and within tolerable lim-
its, ensuring that the weaker signal does not get lost due to the high
power of the stronger signal. The dynamic transmit power adjust-
ment of the clients can be decided based on existing channel as-
sessment techniques as done in CDMA [1]. The calibration of the
transmit power control mechanism based on the channel condition
is kept as future work. In this way, we can set a single threshold
to detect all the clients in the network, as the received power of the
individual subcarriers become similar after adaptive power control.
To detect the farthest client, we need to detect its signal. We ar-
gue that the weakest client’s signal at the AP is not only detectable,
but also decodable if a packet is transmitted. Otherwise normal
802.11 communication with that client will not have been possible.
In case our proposed protocol fails to detect acknowledgment from
the weakest client, the fallback mechanism to retransmit to that par-
ticular client will ensure reliable delivery of the broadcast message
to the client.

the time to gather reliable acknowledgments for broadcasts. We
use the physical layer to combine the responses from the different
nodes. Upon receiving a successful broadcast message from the AP
the clients use their pre-deﬁned subcarriers to transmit a
as an
ACK.
(cid:2)1(cid:2)
To summarize, the protocol has the following steps:
1. When nodes join the network, the AP assigns each node a
unique “membership id”, which is a small integer.
2. An AP sends the broadcast message using conventional PHY
speciﬁcations for 802.11a/g.
3. On receiving the broadcast message all clients decode the
message (if possible).
4. If a client successfully decodes the message, the client then
uses the single orthogonal subcarrier speciﬁed by the mem-
bership identiﬁer to indicate it has received and decoded the
message
5. The AP receives the composite time domain signal of all
OFDM subcarriers and performs an FFT to obtain the fre-
quency domain representation of the signal. After perform-
ing demodulation the individual acknowledgments can be re-
covered. A one in the nth bit position can be mapped as an
ACK from one of the N (number of subcarriers) clients.
Due to the conversion between the time domain and frequency
domain, relatively tight timing synchronization is needed for the
composite additive signal to be decoded at the AP – in other words,
all the responding stations must transmit at about the same time;
however, that time synchronization is provided by the broadcast
message itself as explained in §5.2.
To understand how much more efﬁcient it is to use physical layer
signaling, consider the costs of transmitting a message using the
17false positive by employing a simple all or nothing decision metric.
If the AP fails to detect energy in all of the subcarriers assigned to a
client, it is regarded as a false positive. Assigning multiple random
subcarriers 5M Hz apart will ensure robustness against interfer-
ence from Zigbee nodes. Also, we argue that there exist remote
possibilities where a hidden terminal client of another AP in our
protocol is assigned the exact same combination of subcarriers as
one of the intended clients of our AP and respond in the exact same
time slot of our FFT window for detection. Hence, we ignore this
problem in this paper.
We refer to any unwanted signal of equal to or more than
20M Hz bandwidth as wideband interference, which causes false
positives in the detection mechanism at the AP. For a long-lived
wideband interference we can eliminate the chances of false detec-
tion by performing FFT immediately before and after the protocol
window of (8μsec + 2μsec) = 10μsec as in Figure 4 – if sig-
nals are detected prior to or following the intended transmission
time, the likely source of those signals would be long-term noise or
interference. To detect errors due to wideband interference of du-
ration less than 10μsec, we keep two subcarriers (+20 and −20)
unassigned to any client. Energy in any of these two subcarriers
will detect the presence of a wideband interference. In this sce-
nario, a rebroadcast after carrier sensing can efﬁciently solve the
problem. However, if the wideband interference is very short lived
in the order of nsec (as in UWB), it will not affect the FFT results
as the sampling frequency of our system is 12.5nsec which is more
than the pulse width.
5. SYSTEM PARAMETERS
Normal wireless communication is a point-to-multi-point pro-
cess involving a single transmitter and one or more receivers; our
design inverts that assumption. There are some important chal-
lenges in implementing such a protocol.
5.1 Threshold
The use of thresholds is very common in signal detection and de-
coding. From the basic operation of carrier sensing in CSMA/CA
to maximum likelihood decoding of baseband modulation to even
advanced forms of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio environ-
ment, all employ some form of threshold testing to extract infor-
mation from the received signal. In this implementation we utilize
Fourier analysis, which is efﬁciently implemented in hardware us-
ing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We use threshold
tests to identify the presence of spectral components (i.e., is a sta-
tion transmitting a tone?).
For a fairly simple signaling mechanism as described in §3 we
simply need to look at the average signal power to decide on a
threshold. Input signal levels are strictly controlled by automatic
gain controllers at the receiver front-ends to prevent saturation of
the analog to digital converters (ADC). The average received signal
strength (RSS) can be measured using eq.2, where r(d) refers to the
received signal samples and D refers to averaging ﬁlter length.
R(d) =
D−1X
|rd+i|2
i=0
(2)
Figure 3 shows experimental results from hardware where signal
energy is averaged over 128 samples. As long as the envelope of
the composite waveform is kept constant the average signal energy
does not change much and is always above the average noise ﬂoor.
Thus we argue that this average RSS can be used to determine the
threshold level and there is no need to change threshold over time as
Figure 2: Protocol Fallback Decision Tree
4.2 Against Interference
A signiﬁcant contributor that might cause the protocol to degrade
are spurious or burst noise in 2.4 GHz ISM band, e.g., Zigbee,
Bluetooth devices, microwave oven and interference from hidden
terminals.
In order to address such scenarios we present a fallback mech-
anism of the protocol which involves upper layer intervention in
order to make the protocol robust and reliable in presence of spuri-
ous interference. Figure 2 shows the possible states of the protocol
and the decision making mechanism at the AP. We start by deﬁning
the cause and effect of the protocol’s decision branch. Cause refers
to the intended responses of the stations/clients and effect is deﬁned
as the response of the stations/clients as detected by the AP. Both
the cause and the effect can have two possible binary states - True
or False. Based on all possible combinations of cause and effect we
address the error correcting mechanisms or a fallback method.
Branches True/True and False/False - These two branches ex-
If the intended and
hibit error free functioning of the protocol.
actual responses match then no error correction is required.
Branch True/False - This decision branch can be attributed to
instantaneous channel noise between the AP and station. This er-
ror can occur in two ways: either the station did not receive the
broadcast message or the ACK is attenuated at the AP and fails the
threshold test. We refer to the second phenomenon, where the sta-
tion transmits the tone but the AP does not recognize it, as a False
Negative.
It is possible that a receiver may simply not hear the
query and fail to respond. As with any protocol that assumes the
absence of response to be meaningful, some higher level method
is needed to insure that such a decision is appropriate or that the
protocol should be amended to insure that only positive responses
are acted on.
Branch False/True - Wideband or Narrowband noise can cause
the threshold test to falsely trigger and we refer this phenomenon
as a False Positive. As described in section 5.2 the signal detec-
tion mechanism operates in a small time window of 4μsec after the
SIFS period. So if there exists any unwanted narrowband or broad-
band signal within the FFT window that can be taken care of in the
following way.
Interference can be of two types - either a narrowband or a broad-
band. We refer to any interference less than 20M Hz bandwidth as
narrowband interference, which essentially corrupts the intended
spectrum partially. Zigbee, which operates in a 5MHz bandwidth
can be one of the potential narrowband interferers. Hidden terminal
clients of another AP using our protocol can also be another poten-
tial narrowband interferer. To reduce the errors introduced due to
narrowband interference, we assign each client multiple subcarriers
to transmit ACKs. This mechanism will allow the AP to detect a
18Figure 3: Received signal strength
long as the average signal energy is kept fairly constant by suitable
gain controller.
5.2 Timing Considerations
The effectiveness of using Fourier transform to extract spectral
components requires all the subcarriers to be present with sufﬁ-
cient energy within the FFT window. In this implementation (§6)
we have used a 256-point FFT that corresponds to one OFDM sym-
bol (3.2μs). Therefore, this window of 256 samples should have
all the subcarrier information. Evidently, there is an implicit timing
constraint imposed on the broadcast node. This is further wors-
ened due to the near-far effect and the different processing power
of the clients nodes causing the tones to reach the AP at different
times. Therefore the broadcast node has to estimate a suitable FFT
window to successfully receive the ACKs. This time is calculated
from, after the last sample transmitted to air interface to the ﬁrst
sample of a valid FFT window, which is given by eq. 3.
T ≥ 2×Tpropagation +Trxlatency +Thardware +Ttxlatency (3)
Assuming a typical distance from the AP to the farthest node in
an infrastructure based network to be ≈ 300m results in a round
trip delay of about 2μs, together with receive-transmit path laten-
cies and Rx − Tx turnaround time for our hardware (Trxlatency +
Thardware + Ttxlatency) allows us to decide on the correct FFT
window. Given that each OFDM symbol has a duration of 4μs,
we can deﬁne a ﬂexible FFT window which compensates for all the
latencies and propagation delays as given in eq.3.
Figure 4: FFT timing requirement
Figure. 4 shows the relative timing diagram and optimum FFT
windows. Given a RTT of 2μs from the farthest node we start the
FFT window anywhere after 2μs which gives us enough ﬂexibility
against any unforeseen signal delays. The “black bar” marks the
optimum FFT window of 3.2μs or 256 sample wide.
Unlike single user OFDM transmission, strict receiver timing
synchronization is not required since no demodulation is required
despite receiving data from multiple clients – we are simply de-
tecting “energy in the channel”. Also, since these are unique single
frequency tones, the OFDM subcarriers are transmitted without any
PLCP header or any identiﬁers like pilot tones which saves band-

width and makes detection faster at the AP. This makes implemen-
tation fairly simple and straightforward, and the technique should
be able to be implemented on commodity 802.11 hardware.
5.3 Frequency offset and Doppler shift
The composite baseband received signal can be represented by
r(n) =
N−1X
i=0
Aiej2π(fi+δfo+δfdi
)nTs
(4)
where Ai,fi,δfo, δfdi are respectively the resultant amplitude,
subcarrier frequency, frequency offset during down-conversion at
the receiver and the Doppler shift for the ith subcarrier.
Frequency offset correction is extremely important for normal
OFDM based packet transmissions. Any residual frequency from
the down-conversion stage may cause a signiﬁcant change in mod-
ulation level, which makes it impossible to decode (demodulate)
the signal.
This is precisely the reason why we do not demodulate the sig-
nal – we simply look for power in the subcarrier (i.e., a “tone”).
Since we are not worried about modulation levels, any offset in fre-
quency will not affect the FFT results. Thus we argue that since
the subcarrier spacing for our implementation is 312.5KHz, car-
rier frequency offsets, which is typically in tens of KHz for the
radios used in our experiments, will not cause subcarriers to shift
frequency bins.
Doppler spread is the maximum frequency shift between the
transmitter and the receiver caused by their relative motion or by
any scatterer in the environment. Doppler shift is given by eq. 5.
fm = vfc
c
(5)
where fm is the maximum frequency shift of the signal trans-
mitted at the carrier frequency of fc, with a relative velocity of v
between the transmitter and the receiver; c being the velocity of
light. Using eq.5, for a object moving at 5km/hr which is a typ-
ical human walking speed we have a maximum Doppler shift of
approximately 11Hz. Therefore the Doppler shift is not sufﬁcient
to cause spectral leakage onto adjoining subcarriers. Unless the
nodes are highly mobile it is very unlikely that the sinusoid enve-
lope will vary to such an extent to cause the threshold test to fail.
Neither will it cause the subcarrier to shift frequency bin leading to
false detections.

IMPLEMENTING SMACK USING SDR
To demonstrate simultaneous reception for reliable acknowledg-
ments we implemented a prototype using a SDR platform. The
SDR involves an OFDM transceiver on a Virtex-IV FPGA along
with a custom front-end radio as shown in Figure 5. The design
and implementation has been detailed in [11, 9], which deals with
all the signal processing algorithms that have been synthesized into
19Figure 6: Design for the detecting ACK at AP
ﬁxed point hardware designs. The platform is capable of trans-
mitting and receiving generic 802.11g as given in physical layer
speciﬁcation [13]. The OFDM transceiver components consist of a
custom radio front-end responsible for up/down conversion to/from
the 2.4GHz ISM band and a Xilinx ExtremeDSP development kit
IV manufactured by Nallatech. The ExtremeDSP board includes
either a Virtex IV or a Virtex II FPGA equipped with a PCI/USB
interface and two sets of A/D and D/A converters. Gain control is
also a part of the radio that can be controlled by software on the
host computer.
