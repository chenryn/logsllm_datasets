A. A CONSTANT TIME ALGORITHM FOR
APPROXIMATING CLUSTERING COEF-
FICIENTS
Before going to details of the algorithm and analysis, we intro-
duce a few notations. In both directed or undirected SANs, a triple
t consists of three nodes (v, u, w) satisfying v, w ∈ Γs(u), where
Algorithm 2: Constant Time Approximate Algorithm for Com-
puting the Average Clustering Coefﬁcient
Input: (SAN, Ω, K), where SAN = (Vs, Va, Es, Ea), Ω is the set
of nodes whose average clustering coefﬁcient CΩ is
approximated and K is the number of samples needed.
Output: Approximate average clustering coefﬁcient ˜CΩ.

Sample a pair of nodes v and w uniformly at random from

u∈Ω c(u) = 2−I(cid:80)
(cid:80)
u is called the center and v, w are called the endpoints of t. More-
over, αt and βt denote respectively the center node and the two
endpoints of t.
For a directed SAN and a set of triples T , we deﬁne a mapping
F : T −→ {0, 1, 2}, where F (t = (v, u, w)) = 0 if v and w
are not connected, F (t = (v, u, w)) = 1 if they are connected
by one directed link and F (t = (v, u, w)) = 2 if they are recip-
rocally linked. For an undirected SAN, the mapping is deﬁned as
F : T −→ {0, 1}, where F (t = (v, u, w)) = 0 if v and w are
not connected, otherwise F (t = (v, u, w)) = 1. Let I be an in-
dicator variable of the directedness of a SAN, where I = 0 when
the SAN is undirected, otherwise I = 1. With the indicator vari-
able I, we have 0 ≤ F (t) ≤ 2I, which is useful for deriving the
approximation bounds in the follows.

t∈TΩ
For any set of nodes Ω, their average clustering coefﬁcient can be
|Ω|τ (αt) F (t),
represented as CΩ = 1|Ω|
2|Γs(αt)|(|Γs(αt)| − 1)
where TΩ = {t|αt ∈ Ω} and τ (αt) = 1
is the number of triples whose center node is αt.
If t is a uni-
formly distributed random variable over Ω, then we have CΩ =
2−I E[F (t)]. This observation informs us the design of our ap-
proximate algorithm, which is shown in Algorithm 2. Our algo-
rithm computes the average social clustering coefﬁcient when set-
ting Ω = Vs, and the average attribute clustering coefﬁcient when
setting Ω = Va. Note that our algorithm can also be used to com-
pute average clustering coefﬁcient distribution with respect to node
degrees. The following theorem bounds the error of our algorithm.
22 (cid:101), the
approximated average clustering coefﬁcient ˜CΩ output by our al-
gorithm satisﬁes | ˜CΩ − CΩ| ≤  with probability at least 1 − 1
ν .
PROOF. Assume t1, t2,··· , tK are K independently and uni-
formly distributed random variables over the triple set TΩ. Then
we have CΩ = E[ 1
i=1 F (ti)]. According to Hoeffding’s
2I K
bound [20], we obtain
