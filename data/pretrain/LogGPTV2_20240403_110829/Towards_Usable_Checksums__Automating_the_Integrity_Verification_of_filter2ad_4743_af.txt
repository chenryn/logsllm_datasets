RQ5. We now report the results of our user experiment related to
the browser extension carried out in the second phase. As explained
in Section 7, in order to study user reaction to the messages dis-
played by the extension and to collect user feedback, in the second
phase of our user experiment (with eye tracking), we asked the
subjects to activate the extension and to download two programs
(RealVNC and Audacity) from the corresponding official websites.
The checksum of the second download (Audacity) was incorrect.
During the experiment, 40% of the participants stopped when
shown the warning message for the (corrupted) Audacity download.
For those who did not, the reason they reported most frequently
(in the exit survey) was that they tend to ignore popups shown on
webpage systematically because they are too frequent and often
irrelevant or even scams.
Among the participants who did stop, 50% removed the download
file: 37.5% of them clicked on the dedicated “delete” link embedded
in the warning message to delete the (corrupted) downloaded file
and the remaining 62.5% manually removed the file.
In the exit survey, the participants reported an average satis-
faction score of 5.2±1.4 (on a scale from 1 to 7).25 Furthermore,
the participants reported an average desirability score of 4.6±1.9
(“Should the extension be available for download, how likely would
you be to use it?”), with 55% of the participants answering posi-
tively, and an average net promoter score of 4.5±1.9 (“How likely
would you be to recommend it to a friend or relative?”), with 55%
of the participants answering positively. In these questions, the
comparison was implicit to the status-quo offered by the command-
line interface that the participants tested in the first part of the
experiment.
Another observation from the user experiment was that 26/40
participants (65%) could not explain the objective of integrity verifi-
cation in the exit questionnaire (before the debriefing). This reveals
the inability of non-technical users to grasp the concept behind
checksum-based integrity verification.
Finally, the participants gave us feedback on the messages dis-
played by the browser extension. The main comments were the
following: The terminology used in the message was too technical
or unclear (7 participants): “Plutôt sobre je trouve bien mais pour un
neophyte, il n’est pas très clair par rapport à son rôle. (It is rather sober
I think but for a newbie it is not clear enough in relation to its role)”;
the popup did not sufficiently catch their attention (4 participants)–
they suggested using larger icons and using colors for the text
messages themselves or even to remove the icons–:“Sans le petit
logo vert, qui fait penser à celui d’un antivirus, c’est personnellement
le genre de message auquel je fais très rarement attention. (The little
green logo, which makes me think about an antivirus, should be re-
moved as it is the kind of message that I would rarely pay attention
to.)”; the design of the skip button allowed participants to easily
skip it (2 participants): Pour éviter que le message ne soit fermé tout
de suite, il faudrait peut-être bloquer le reste de la navigation tant
que le message n’est pas fermé. Ou le laisser ouvert obligatoirement
pendant quelques secondes. (To prevent the user from immediately
dismissing the message the message, it would be necessary to block
the user from pursuing navigation until the message is closed. Or to
force the message to remain open for a few seconds). . Interestingly,
during the informal feedback with the experimenter, several par-
ticipants reported that they are, in general, annoyed by popups
displayed within webpages and tend to ignore them.26 Also, they
mentioned that a warning originating directly from the browser in
a standalone window would have been more effective.
During the experiment, we also received positive feedback on
the extension. Several participants commented positively that the
design of the message and the terms used were clear: Le message est
assez clair et explique bien pourquoi le fichier devrait être supprimé
(The message is rather clear and it explains well why the file has to
scale.
25For all the self-reported scores given in this section, we used a 7-level Likert
26Showing fake (security) warnings within webpages to push users to download
and install malicious programs is a common practice, e.g, fake antivirus or flash players.

be deleted), Ce message apparaît de manière assez claire dans la page,
donc cela permet à l’utilisateur d’être au courant sur ce qu’il télécharge.
(This message appears in a clear way on the page. This allows the user
to be aware of what she is downloading.) These results suggest that
the extension was rated slightly desirable by most participants. The
study helped identify several areas for improvement of the design,
namely around the behavior of the extension and the messages
displayed to encourage the users to delete the downloaded file in
case of mismatch (see Section 8).
Limitations. Like any lab study, the experiment suffered from
low ecological validity. Also, the prescriptiveness of the sequence
of tasks that we gave to participants reduced the ability to observe
participants’ spontaneous behavior when downloading files. Also,
we might have introduced a learning bias by choosing not to ran-
domize the presentation of the first and the second part of the study
might have .
8 DISCUSSION
Our large-scale user survey shows that the majority of computer
users are vulnerable to attacks through corrupted download files.
Checksum is one of the most prevalent solutions for countering
such attacks. However, most users have a hard time grasping the
idea behind integrity verification. Through the survey, we learned
that users neither understand nor use them (95% do not know how
to use them, 98% do not use them for verifying a file integrity).
Through the user experiment, we also consolidated this finding:
Even when users were explicitly asked to verify checksums, most
of them have had a hard time understanding what they were doing
and often failed at detecting strategic replacements (38% of the
time). Furthermore, after having spent over 30 minutes manually
verifying checksums, looking at our extension and answering ques-
tions related to checksums, 65% of the participants still had troubles
explaining what was the purpose of checksums. Therefore, we ar-
gue that raising awareness around manual checksums verification
would require substantial efforts.
In this paper, we argue that a viable solution to increase the se-
curity and usability of web downloads is to automate the checksum
verification process. Through the lab study, we tested an initial de-
sign for an extension that would automate the integrity verification.
In our initial design the user was left in charge of deciding whether
the downloaded file (for which there was a mismatch) had to be re-
moved from the system. Unfortunately, we learned that this design
was not really effective at making people aware of potential threats.
This finding resonates well with the suggestions of Tan et al. [44].
As highlighted by prior work, security warnings might be skipped
for a variety of reasons: notifications overload, habituation [42],
inattention blindness [47], etc.
We argue that designers should choose defaults to privilege users’
security over preserving user’s choice. In fact, a lack of action from
the user does not necessarily mean that she is willing to accept the
risk of proceeding but might simply be due to the aforementioned
effects. Concretely, in the case of a mismatch, instead of warning
the users and suggesting them to delete the corrupted files (opt-in
approach), the extension should block access to the downloaded
files a priori and ask for users’ action to unblock it. This opt-out
approach is similar to the one implemented by antivirus or spam
filters which put files or e-mails in quarantine.
9 CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK
In this work, we opened a line of research on the use of checksums
for integrity verification of web downloads and made a number of
contributions.
Given the user feedback and results of our in situ experiments, we
plan to improve the user interface of our extension to make it clearer
about the potential risks of installing corrupted download files.
More specifically, we will deploy an instrumented beta version of
our extension and run a longitudinal study to gather more feedback
from the end users and at a larger scale. To do so, we will rely on
the well-established experience sampling method that collects in
situ data by requesting participants to provide short self-reports at
multiple random occasions over time [13, 14]. This will also enable
us to collect data about checksums in the wild.
Finally, we believe it is paramount to robustify and improve the
software artifacts (browser and CMS extensions) we produced and
make them available to a wide audience. In addition we intend
to promote our proposals to (and collaborate with) the different
stakeholders involved, that is the W3C, web browsers (e.g., Google,
Mozilla) and CMS (e.g., WordPress, Drupal) development teams in
order to have a concrete impact on the security of Internet users.
