### RQ5. User Experiment Results for the Browser Extension

In this section, we present the results of our user experiment related to the browser extension, which was conducted in the second phase of our study. As described in Section 7, the purpose of this experiment was to evaluate user reactions to the messages displayed by the extension and to gather feedback. During this phase, participants were asked to activate the extension and download two programs (RealVNC and Audacity) from their respective official websites. The checksum for the second download (Audacity) was intentionally incorrect.

**User Reactions to Warning Messages:**
- **Stopping Downloads:** 40% of the participants stopped the download process when shown the warning message for the corrupted Audacity file.
- **Reasons for Ignoring Warnings:** Among those who continued, the most frequently cited reason was a tendency to ignore popups on webpages due to their frequency and perceived irrelevance or potential malicious intent.

**Actions Taken by Participants Who Stopped:**
- **File Deletion:** 50% of the participants who stopped the download removed the file.
  - **Using the "Delete" Link:** 37.5% of these participants used the dedicated "delete" link provided in the warning message.
  - **Manual Deletion:** The remaining 62.5% manually deleted the file.

**Satisfaction and Desirability Scores:**
- **Satisfaction Score:** Participants reported an average satisfaction score of 5.2 ± 1.4 on a scale from 1 to 7.
- **Desirability Score:** The average desirability score, which measured the likelihood of using the extension if available, was 4.6 ± 1.9. 55% of the participants responded positively.
- **Net Promoter Score:** The average net promoter score, which gauged the likelihood of recommending the extension to others, was 4.5 ± 1.9, with 55% of participants responding positively.

**Understanding of Integrity Verification:**
- **Comprehension Issues:** 65% of the participants (26 out of 40) could not explain the concept of integrity verification in the exit questionnaire before the debriefing. This highlights the difficulty non-technical users have in understanding checksum-based integrity verification.

**Feedback on Warning Messages:**
- **Terminology and Clarity:** Seven participants found the terminology too technical or unclear. For example, one participant commented, "It is rather sober, but for a newbie, it is not clear enough in relation to its role."
- **Attention-Grabbing:** Four participants suggested that the popup did not sufficiently catch their attention. They proposed using larger icons, colored text, or even removing the icons. One participant noted, "The little green logo, which makes me think about an antivirus, should be removed as it is the kind of message that I would rarely pay attention to."
- **Skip Button Design:** Two participants mentioned that the design of the skip button made it easy to dismiss the message. They suggested blocking further navigation until the message is closed or keeping the message open for a few seconds. One participant stated, "To prevent the user from immediately dismissing the message, it would be necessary to block the user from pursuing navigation until the message is closed. Or to force the message to remain open for a few seconds."

**Positive Feedback:**
- Several participants praised the clarity of the message and the terms used. For example, one participant said, "The message is rather clear and explains well why the file has to be deleted." Another noted, "This message appears in a clear way on the page, allowing the user to be aware of what they are downloading."

**Study Limitations:**
- **Ecological Validity:** The lab setting may have reduced the ecological validity of the study.
- **Task Sequence Prescriptiveness:** The prescriptive nature of the tasks limited the observation of participants' spontaneous behavior during downloads.
- **Learning Bias:** The lack of randomization between the first and second parts of the study may have introduced a learning bias.

### Discussion

Our large-scale user survey revealed that most computer users are vulnerable to attacks through corrupted download files. Checksums are a prevalent solution for countering such attacks, but most users struggle to understand and use them. Our user experiment confirmed this, as even when explicitly asked to verify checksums, many participants had difficulty understanding the process and often failed to detect strategic replacements (38% of the time). Additionally, after spending over 30 minutes on checksum-related tasks, 65% of participants still could not explain the purpose of checksums.

**Automating the Checksum Verification Process:**
- We argue that automating the checksum verification process can enhance both security and usability of web downloads. In our initial design, users were responsible for deciding whether to remove a mismatched file. However, this approach was not effective in raising awareness of potential threats.
- To improve effectiveness, we suggest adopting an opt-out approach where the extension blocks access to downloaded files by default and requires user action to unblock them. This method is similar to the quarantine systems used by antivirus and spam filters.

### Conclusion and Future Work

This research opens a new line of inquiry into the use of checksums for integrity verification of web downloads. Based on user feedback and experimental results, we plan to:
- Improve the user interface of our extension to better communicate the risks of installing corrupted files.
- Deploy an instrumented beta version of the extension and conduct a longitudinal study to gather more extensive feedback from a larger user base.
- Use the experience sampling method to collect in-situ data and insights into real-world checksum usage.
- Robustify and promote our software artifacts, collaborating with stakeholders such as the W3C, web browsers, and content management systems to enhance the security of Internet users.
