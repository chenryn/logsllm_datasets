Challenge Target the Parent of an Element Using jQuery has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
My code:
        jQuery Playground
            #left-well
              #target1
              #target2
              #target3
            #right-well
              #target4
              #target5
              #target6
The target5 button is cloned to the left-well but 2 times. This surely is a
bug.
