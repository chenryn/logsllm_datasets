User: I know you can remove the dock icon for an app by setting LSUIELEMENT = 1. I have an executable created by cx_freeze, which bundles a set of Python scripts into a single executable. How can I remove the dock icon, with or without using AppleScript?
Assistant: My app has some helper command-line tools in one of its frameworks. If the tools are stored in the frameworkâ€™s executable directory, Mac OS X wants to show them in the Dock. Since the tools run quickly, this appears as a brief flash where all the other Dock icons move to make space for the new icon and then move back.
To fix this, I am setting LSBackgroundOnly to true in the Info.plist. LSUIElement would probably also work. Since a command-line tool is just a single file, the way that you set the Info.plist is to have a separate file that Xcode embeds in the binary. You can set this by adding  -sectcreate __TEXT __info_plist $(INFOPLIST_FILE) to the OTHER_LDFLAGS build setting. (Hopefully there is a Makefile line or equivalent where you can set this for cx_freeze.)
