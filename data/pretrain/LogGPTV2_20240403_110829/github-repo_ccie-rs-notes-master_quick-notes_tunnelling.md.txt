# Trivia
* IPSec VTI - routable int, terminates IPSec, supports multicast
## DMVPN
* Each spoke persisent IPSec tun to hub
* Address of hub must be known by all spokes
* Spokes register address as client to NHS
* NHS maintains DB of public addr used by spokes
* Spoke to spoke - requests to NHS for pub ip of other spoke
 * On Demand
**Phase 1**
* Simple hub and spoke
* Dynamic IPs on spokes
* Hubs mGRE
* Spokes GRE
**Phase 2**
* Adds spoke-to-spoke comms
* Allow with `no ip next-hop-self eigrp AS` on tunnel
* No summarization
* OSPF single area, limited hubs due to OSPF DR/BDR
* First packet through hub process switched
* All mGRE
**Phase 3**
* Two NHRP enhancements
 * NHRP Redirect - Hub to spoke, lets spoke know of better path to other spoke through hub (Conf on hub only)
* NHRP Shortcut - Overwrites CEF info on spoke (configure on spoke and hub)
* Make sure `no ip split-horizon eigrp ASN` on for spoke to spoke
* No need for no ip next-hop-self, as NHRP will redirect regardless
* Packet still send to hup unless IPSec session comes up
* Routes go in as NHRP routes
### QoS
* On the interface do `ip nhrp map group NAME service-policy out NAME`
## IPv6 Tunnelling
* Auto 6to4 - Point to MP, 2002::/16 - Connects isolated v6 islands
 * V6 prefix is 2002:border-router-ipv4-address::/48
 * one tunnel per router
 * Tunnel dest not config'd
 * Need to route 2002::/16 over tunnel
* Manual config - any addr space, P2P, dual stack required both ends, carries v6 across v4
* v6 over v4 gre - UNicast addr, p2p, carries any traffic across
* ISATAP - p2MP, any mcast, v6 hosts in single site
 * [64bit link local or global unicast prefix]:0000:5EFE:[IPv4 address of ISATAP Link]
 * Disables RAs by default
 * no ipv6 nd suppress-ra
* Auto v4-compat - P2MP, ::96 address space, dual stack both ends, deprecated, use ISATAP
 * First 96 bits tunnel int all 0s, rremaining 32 from v4 addr
## L2 VPNs
* Tagged mode - ID mathes on AC either end
 * VLAN match on each end
 * pw type of 0x0004
 * Every frame on PW different VLAN for each customer (VLAN = service delimiting tag)
 * If frame RX'd missing VLAN tag, PE prepends one
* Raw Mode - Tag not always present
 * PW Type 0x0005
 * Service tags never through AC
 * Stripped from frame before transmitting
* L2TPv3 
 * Any l2 payload
 * IP Proto 115
 * CEF required
 * Has control channel
* OTV - Looks like VPLS
 * Fault domain isolation
 * STP root doesn't change, each CE has own
 * Deployed at CE
 * Multicast similar to whats in L3 VPNs
 * like VPLS but wihtout MPLS transport
 * L2 LAN-E over L3, L2 or MPLS networks
## GET VPN
* Encrypts through insecure networks
* KS and GM
* KS creates, maintains and sends policy to GM
 * Policy is what traffic and algs
* KEK and TEK
 * KEK is between KS and GM, used for rekey phase
 * Tek for traffic
* Uses ESP
* RSA Key used by KS for Rekey
* New TEK and KEK before TEK expires (default 3600s)
* Phase authed and secure by ISAKMP SA between KS and GM
* GDOI messages build SA and Encrypt GM registration, UDP port 848
