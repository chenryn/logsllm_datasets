/tn 
Specifies a name for the task. Each task on the system must have a unique name and must conform to the rules for file names, not exceeding 238 characters. Use quotation marks to enclose names that include spaces. To store your scheduled task in a different folder, run /tn .
/tr 
Specifies the program or command that the task runs. Type the fully qualified path and file name of an executable file, script file, or batch file. The path name must not exceed 262 characters. If you don't add the path, schtasks assumes that the file is in the \System32 directory.
/s 
Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer (with or without backslashes). The default is the local computer.
/u []
Runs this command with the permissions of the specified user account. The default is the permissions of the current user of the local computer. The /u and /p parameters are valid only when you use /s. The permissions of the specified account are used to schedule the task and to run the task. To run the task with the permissions of a different user, use the /ru parameter. The user account must be a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer. Also, the local computer must be in the same domain as the remote computer, or must be in a domain that is trusted by the remote computer domain.
/p 
Specifies the password of the user account specified in the /u parameter. If you use the /u parameter without the /p parameter or the password argument, schtasks will prompt you for a password. The /u and /p parameters are valid only when you use /s.
/ru {[] | system}
Runs the task with permissions of the specified user account. By default, the task runs with the permissions of the current user of the local computer, or with the permission of the user specified by the /u parameter, if one is included.

The valid options include:Domain - Specifies an alternate user account.System - Specifies the local System account, a highly privileged account used by the operating system and system services.
