ABSTRACT
Digital signatures are perhaps the most important base
for authentication and trust relationships in large scale
systems. More speciﬁcally, various applications of signa-
tures provide privacy and anonymity preserving mech-
anisms and protocols, and these, in turn, are becoming
critical (due to the recently recognized need to protect in-
dividuals according to national rules and regulations). A
speciﬁc type of signatures called “signatures with eﬃcient
protocols”, as introduced by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya
(CL), eﬃciently accommodates various basic protocols
and extensions like zero-knowledge proofs, signing com-
mitted messages, or re-randomizability. These are, in
fact, typical operations associated with signatures used
in typical anonymity and privacy-preserving scenarios.
To date there are no “signatures with eﬃcient protocols”
which are based on simple assumptions and truly prac-
tical. These two properties assure us a robust primi-
tive: First, simple assumptions are needed for ensur-
ing that this basic primitive is mathematically robust
and does not require special ad hoc assumptions that
are more risky, imply less eﬃciency, are more tuned to
the protocol itself, and are perhaps less trusted. In the
other dimension, eﬃciency is a must given the anonymity
applications of the protocol, since without proper level
of eﬃciency the future adoption of the primitives is al-
ways questionable (in spite of their need). In this work,
we present a new CL-type signature scheme that is re-
randomizable under a simple, well-studied, and by now
standard, assumption (SXDH). The signature is eﬃcient
(built on the recent QA-NIZK constructions), and is, by
design, suitable to work in extended contexts that typify
privacy settings (like anonymous credentials, group sig-
nature, and oﬄine e-cash). We demonstrate its power by
presenting practical protocols based on it.

INTRODUCTION
Digital signatures are one of the fundamental crypto-
graphic building blocks used in countless applications.
The design of privacy-preserving protocols often requires
signature schemes that are compatible with other primi-
tives, primarily zero-knowledge proofs. Namely, it should
be possible to sign messages without aﬀecting their al-
gebraic structure (in particular, without hashing them),
in a way that maintains a signature holder’s capability
of eﬃciently proving statements about hidden message-
signature pairs. Primitives like “structure-preserving sig-
natures” [1, 39] or “signatures with eﬃcient protocols”
[18] were designed exactly in this spirit. While the for-
mer are motivated by security proofs in the standard
model via the Groth-Sahai proof systems [32], the latter
aim at enabling truly practical schemes.
Signature schemes with eﬃcient protocols by Ca-
menisch and Lysyanskaya [18] typically extend the func-
tionalities of ordinary digital signatures in two ways: (i)
They provide a protocol whereby a signer can obliviously
sign a committed message known only to the user; (ii)
Users should be able to eﬃciently prove possession of a
hidden message-signature pair in a zero-knowledge man-
ner. The latter property has proved extremely useful in
the design of many eﬃcient anonymity-related protocols
such as anonymous credentials [21, 17], compact e-cash
[16], revocable group signatures [43], oblivious transfer
with access control [15] or certiﬁed private set intersec-
tion protocols [20].
The quality of a signature scheme is measured in two
dimensions (and interactions thereof): ﬁrst, the simplic-
ity of the cryptographic assumption on which it is based,
and secondly, its computational eﬃciency. So far, regard-
ing cryptographic assumptions, most signature schemes
with eﬃcient protocols either require groups of hidden
order [18] – where elements need a longer representation
to keep the group order hidden – or they rely on non-
standard hardness assumptions [19, 4, 45] in groups with
a bilinear maps (or both since the Strong RSA assump-
tion [5], which [18] relies on, is usually not recognized
as standard). Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CL) [19]
showed how to adapt their Strong-RSA-based scheme in
pairing-friendly groups. Their scheme, however, relies
on the interactive LRSW assumption [42]. Moreover, as
pointed out in [46], it requires O(n) group elements to
sign messages made of (cid:96) blocks. Pointcheval and Sanders
[46] recently modiﬁed CL signatures to sign (cid:96)-block mes-
sages using O(1) group elements, but their scheme is only
proven secure in the generic group model. While the
ﬁrst CL signature [18] has a natural counterpart [4, 45]
based on a non-interactive assumption, it still requires a
non-standard “q-type” assumption [13] where the number
of input elements depends on the number of adversarial
queries. We note that here we call all the above assump-
tions “non standard” (whether they are employed in the
regular or random oracle models). For the time being,
we are only aware of two schemes based on ﬁxed-size as-
sumptions. The ﬁrst one is a variant, due to Gerbush
et al. [33], of Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures [19] in
composite order groups. Due to its much larger group or-
der, it is inherently much less eﬃcient than solutions in
prime-order groups: for equivalent security levels, Free-
man estimates [29] that computing a pairing over groups
of order N = pq is at least 50 times slower than the same
pairing in the prime order setting. The second construc-
tion is a scheme, proposed by Yuen et al. [49] under the
Decision Linear assumption [14]. Unfortunately, unlike
LRSW-based Camenisch-Lysyanskaya signatures [19], it
is deﬁcient as it does not provide “randomizable signa-
tures,” an important property which – in the context of
group signatures, for instance – enables re-randomization
of credentials across distinct privacy-preserving authen-
tications, and allows for a better eﬃciency.
Our Contribution.
In this paper, we propose a
new signature scheme with eﬃcient protocols and re-
randomizable signatures under simple, well-studied as-
sumptions.
The security of our scheme is proved
in the standard model under the Symmetric eXternal
Diﬃe-Hellman (SXDH) assumption, which is a well-
established, constant-size assumption (i.e., described us-
ing a constant number of elements, regardless of the num-
ber of adversarial queries) in groups with a bilinear map.
Remarkably, we can sign (cid:96)-block messages using only 4
group elements under the SXDH assumption.
Our signature length is enabled by the use of eﬃcient
Quasi-Adaptive Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (QA-
NIZK) arguments for linear subspaces. As introduced
by Jutla and Roy [34], QA-NIZK arguments are com-
putationally sound proofs where the common reference
string (CRS) may depend on the language of which mem-
bership must be proved. It was shown [40, 35, 38] that,
for the task of arguing that a vector of group elements
belongs to some linear subspace, the size of arguments
may be independent of the dimensions of the considered
subspace. Our signature scheme crucially exploits this
observation as (cid:96)-block messages are signed by generating
a QA-NIZK argument for a subspace of dimension O((cid:96)).
Our signature natively supports eﬃcient privacy-
enhancing protocols. We describe a two-party proto-
col allowing a user to obtain a signature on a commit-
ted multi-block message as well as a honest-veriﬁer zero-
knowledge protocol for eﬃciently demonstrating knowl-
edge of a signature on a committed message revealing nei-
ther the message nor the signature. Hence, our scheme
readily enables the design of an eﬃcient anonymous cre-
dentials system based on the sole SXDH assumption.
As another application of our signature scheme, we
describe a truly practical group signature (for dynamic
groups) based on simple assumptions in the random or-
acle model. Our scheme is competitive with the best
solutions [14, 27] based on non-interactive assumptions
(which are those relying on the Strong Diﬃe-Hellman
assumption [13]) in terms of computational cost and
signature length. Concretely, at the 128-bit security
level, each signature ﬁts within 320 bytes while providing
anonymity in the strongest sense (i.e., against adversaries
equipped with a signature opening oracle). To the best of
our knowledge, the new scheme thus features the short-
est group signatures based on standard assumptions.
It seems that our signature scheme has many other
potential applications. For example, combining it with
the ideas of [16] and a pseudo-random function based on
standard assumptions (e.g., [44]) readily gives a compact
e-cash system based on simple hardness assumptions.
Related Work. Anonymous credentials were intro-
duced by Chaum [21] and eﬃciently designed by Ca-
menisch and Lysyanskaya [17, 18]. They involve creden-
tial issuers and users who have a long-term secret key
and pseudonyms which can be seen as commitments to
their secret key. Users can obtain credentials from an is-
suer which only knows their pseudonym and obliviously
certiﬁes their secret key along with (optionally) a set
of associated attributes. Users can subsequently interact
with service providers – who know them under a diﬀerent
pseudonym – and demonstrate possession of the issuer’s
signature on their secret key without leaking anything
else. Anonymous credentials involve a protocol allowing
the user to obtain the issuer’s signature on a committed
message, a protocol for proving that two commitments
open to the same message and a protocol for proving pos-
session of a signature on a committed message.
Camenisch and Lysyanskaya gave the ﬁrst eﬃcient so-
lutions based the Strong RSA assumption [17, 18]. Vari-
ants based on bilinear maps were considered in, e.g., [19,
2]. In the non-interactive setting (i.e., without interac-
tive conversations between provers and veriﬁers) solu-
tions in the standard model were given in [7, 6]. As a
matter of fact, all truly practical solutions [18, 19, 2] re-
quire non-standard ad hoc assumptions.
Group signatures are a central privacy primitive,
coined by Chaum and van Heyst [22], where members of
a group managed by some authority can sign messages
messages in the name of the group. Group member’s
accountability is enforced by means of an opening au-
thority that can identify misbehaving signers. Ateniese,
Camenisch, Joye and Tsudik [3] provided the ﬁrst vi-
able solution meeting the natural security requirements
of the primitive, although rigorous security deﬁnitions
were not available yet. These appeared later on in the
work of Bellare, Micciancio and Warinschi [9], which [36,
11] subsequently extended to the dynamic setting.
In
these models, eﬃcient schemes have been put forth in
the random oracle model [36, 27] and the standard model
[31]. As of now, however, a truly practical solution based
on constant-size assumptions in the random oracle model
remains lacking.
2. BACKGROUND
Notations. We let G, ˆG, GT denote groups of prime
order p ≥ 2λ where λ ∈ N is the security parameter.
Bold capital letters will denote matrices, like M, and
bold lowercase letters stand for vectors, like v. Finally
PPT stands for probabilistic polynomial time.
2.1 Hardness Assumptions
We use bilinear maps e : G × ˆG → GT over groups of
prime order p where e(g, ˆh) (cid:54)= 1GT iﬀ g (cid:54)= 1G and ˆh (cid:54)= 1ˆG.
We rely on hardness assumptions that are non-interactive
and described using a constant number of elements.

Deﬁnition 1. The Decision Diﬃe-Hellman (DDH)
problem in G,
to distinguish the distributions
(ga, gb, gab) and (ga, gb, gc), with a, b, c R← Zp. The DDH
assumption is the intractability of the problem for any
PPT distinguisher.
The SXDH assumption posits the hardness of DDH in G
and ˆG, when G (cid:54)= ˆG.
We also rely on the following problem, which generalizes
the Discrete Logarithm problem to asymmetric pairings.
Deﬁnition 2. In bilinear groups (G, ˆG, GT ) of prime
order p, the Symmetric Discrete Logarithm (SDL)
problem consists in, given (g, ˆg, ga, ˆga) ∈ G × ˆG where
a R← Zp, computing a ∈ Zp.
2.2 Quasi-Adaptive NIZK Arguments for
Linear Subspaces
Quasi-Adaptive NIZK (QA-NIZK) proofs [34] are
NIZK proofs where the common reference string (CRS)
may depend on the language for which proofs have to be
generated. Formal deﬁnitions are given in [34, 40, 38].
This section recalls the QA-NIZK argument of [38] for
proving membership in the row space of a matrix. In the
description below, we assume that all algorithms take as
input the description of common public parameters cp
consisting of asymmetric bilinear groups (G, ˆG, GT , p) of
prime order p > 2λ, where λ is the security parameter.
In this setting the problem is to convince that v is a lin-
ear combination of the rows of a given M ∈ Gt×n.
Kiltz and Wee [38] suggested the following construction
which simpliﬁes [40] and remains secure under SXDH.
We stress that cp is independent of M = ( (cid:126)M1 ··· (cid:126)Mt)T .
