User: How to set up a Git-based team code development environment?
Assistant: The following are the steps to set up a Git-based team code development environment: 1. Create a Git repository: Create a Git repository containing the project code and store it on a code hosting platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. 2. Invite team members: Invite team members to join the repository so they can share and modify code. Invitations can be made through the collaboration feature of the code hosting platform. 3. Determine the development process: Define the Git workflow to ensure the smooth progress of code development and team collaboration. This should include branch management, code reviews and merge strategies, etc. 4. Create a branch: Create a branch on the main branch (dev or master) for code modification, which can be done while doing multiple jobs in parallel and preventing code conflicts. 5. Write code: Team members write code and commit it to their respective branches or shared branches. 6. Conduct code review: Before the code is merged into the main branch, a code review is required. This can be done manually or with tools to ensure code quality and consistency. 7. Merge the code: Once the code review is complete, merge it back into the master branch. By doing this, team members can share modified code and ensure that all members are developing on the same version. 8. Deploy the code: Once the code is merged and highly tested, deploy it to production. 9. Iterative development: Repeat the above steps, continue iterative development, and update the Git workflow when needed.
