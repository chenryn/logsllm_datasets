Question: In a scenario where a cryptosystem utilizes a pRNG to sequentially generate secret keys and then initialization vectors (IVs) for encryption operations, what would be a potential consequence of using a pRNG that lacks rollback resistance?
"A": "It would enhance the performance of the cryptosystem due to simpler algorithmic requirements.",
"B": "It would make the pRNG's output more predictable, facilitating cryptographic operations.",
"C": "It could allow an attacker to deduce the value of the secret key if they compromise the internal state after IV generation.",
"D": "It would increase the cryptographic strength of the IVs generated after the secret keys."
Answer: C
