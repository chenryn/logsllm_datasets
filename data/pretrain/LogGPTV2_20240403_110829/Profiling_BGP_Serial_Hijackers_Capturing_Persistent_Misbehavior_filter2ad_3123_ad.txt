### 7.1 Behaviors Captured by the Classifier

Table 3 provides summary statistics for several representative metrics of the two classes of ASes identified by our ensemble classifier: ASes flagged as having similar BGP origination behavior to serial hijackers and non-flagged ASes. The distributions of these metrics in flagged ASes are significantly different from those in non-flagged ASes.

**Volatile Overall BGP Behavior:**
- **Flagged ASes:** Show more sporadic and volatile BGP activity. The 1st quartile of ASN active time is 65.9%, compared to 99.9% for non-flagged ASes.
- **Prefix Lifespan:** 50% of flagged ASes have a median prefix-origin duration of less than 48.2 days, whereas only 17.9% of non-flagged ASes show this behavior.

**Large ASes:**
- **Prefix Count:** On average, flagged ASes originate more prefixes, with a median prefix count of 41 compared to 23 for non-flagged ASes.
- **High Originators:** 34 flagged ASes have originated over a thousand prefixes, representing 3.64% of the group, compared to only 1.37% of networks in the Internet announcing more than a thousand prefixes.

**Diverse IP Sources:**
- **RIR Gini Index:** Flagged ASes use IP space spread across RIRs, with a median RIR Gini index of 0.675, compared to 0.8 for non-flagged ASes (an RIR Gini index of 0.8 indicates all prefixes originated by that AS come from only one of the five RIRs).
- **MOAS Prefix Share:** Flagged ASes exhibit a larger share of MOAS address space, with a median MOAS prefix share of 22.9% compared to 6.9% for non-flagged ASes.

### 7.2 Indications of Misconfiguration

Some ASes were likely flagged due to BGP misconfiguration issues.

**Private AS Numbers:**
- **RFC 6996:** ASNs [64512, 65534] are reserved for private use. We found 114 private ASNs in the flagged group with very volatile prefix origination behavior and low visibility. This may be due to router misconfigurations, causing these AS numbers to appear at the origin of BGP AS-paths. Many ASes filter out such prefixes, limiting their spread and visibility.

**Fat Finger Errors:**
- **Single-Digit AS Numbers:** Our classifier flagged all single-digit AS numbers, which exhibit extremely volatile origination behavior. These errors often occur when an origin network accidentally adds an additional AS number behind its own during BGP advertisements, a common mistake in AS path prepending. For example, AS5, a defunct AS, was periodically revived through router misconfigurations.

After removing private and single-digit ASes, 811 flagged ASes remain.

### 7.3 Benign Serial Hijackers

In our dataset, 29 DDoS protection networks (e.g., DDoSGuard) originated prefixes, with 18 of these ASes flagged by our classifier. These networks often engage in "legitimate" or benign serial hijacking behavior by originating customer prefixes during DDoS attacks to attract and scrub traffic before tunneling it to the intended destination.

### 7.4 Indications of Malicious Behavior

After removing private AS numbers, single-digit ASes, and DDoS protection ASes, 793 publicly routable ASes remain. We assess if these ASes show indications of malicious behavior, such as spam or probing activity.

**Spamhaus DROP List:**
- **Comparison:** 84 (10.6%) of our flagged ASes are present in the Spamhaus DROP list, compared to only 206 (1.1%) of non-flagged ASes. Flagged ASes are almost 10 times more likely to be in this list of spammers, hijackers, and cyber criminals.
- **Persistent Blacklisting:** Of the 266 ASes blacklisted in all snapshots, 133 originate more than 10 prefixes, and 50 of them are flagged by our classifier, indicating 38% detection of persistent malicious activity.

**Spam Activity:**
- **UCEPROTECT Blacklist:** We find that 38.3% of flagged ASes have at least one address block that was both originated and simultaneously blacklisted. When blacklisted, prefixes originated by flagged ASes tend to be blacklisted for a larger share of their advertisement time (27% for more than 50% of their time) compared to 12% for non-flagged ASes.

### 7.5 Big Players

To identify possible false positives, we inspect large ASes flagged by our classifier. Using CAIDA AS-Rank data, we find 4 flagged ASes in the top 500 and 21 in the top 1000 by customer cone size. These large ASes show highly volatile BGP origination behavior, with a median prefix-origin duration of 69 days compared to 411 for large non-flagged ASes and a higher rate of normalized monthly prefix changes (1.0 vs. 0.35).

### 8 Case Studies

We illustrate three cases of ASes exhibiting misbehavior, two of which are not in our ground truth dataset but are identified by our classifier.

**8.1 The Quintessential Serial Hijacker: Bitcanal (AS197426)**
- **Behavior:** AS197426, part of our ground truth dataset, originated up to 1,500 prefixes over four years. Despite early reports of hijacking in September 2014, coordinated action led to its disconnection in July 2018.
- **Activity Peaks:** Origination activity peaked at â‰ˆ 300 prefixes in mid-2016, with an average of 2.5 changes per day. After being expelled from DE-CIX and other IXPs, AS197426 was finally disconnected on July 9, 2018.

**8.2 A Recent Hijacker: AS19529**
- **Behavior:** AS19529, flagged by our classifier, showed steady origination of 7 prefixes for over a year, followed by a period of inactivity. In November 2017, it returned with 31 prefixes and quickly increased to almost 60 prefixes by the end of 2017. This spike in activity suggests recent hijacking behavior.

These case studies highlight the effectiveness of our classifier in identifying both known and new potential serial hijackers.
