further scrutinize flagged ASes, breaking them into sub-categories.
7.1 Behaviors Captured by the Classifier
Table 3 provides summary statistics of some representative metrics
for the two classes of ASes identified by the ensemble classifier:
ASes flagged as having similar BGP origination behavior to serial
hijackers and non-flagged ASes. For each metric, its distribution
in flagged ASes is considerably different from its distribution in
non-flagged ASes.
Volatile overall BGP behavior: The ASes flagged as having sim-
ilar behavior to serial hijackers show more sporadic and volatile
BGP activity: the 1st quartile of ASN active time is 65.9%, com-
pared to 99.9% for non-flagged ASes. Most prefixes originated by
flagged ASes are shorter-lived than those of non-flagged ASes—50%
of flagged ASes have a median prefix-origin duration of less than
48.2 days vs. only 17.9% of non-flagged ASes.
Large ASes: On average, ASes flagged by our classifier originate
more prefixes than the rest—with a median prefix count of 41 com-
pared to 23 for non-flagged ASes. Furthermore, 34 flagged ASes
have originated over a thousand prefixes, representing 3.64% in
the group, compared to only 1.37% of networks in the Internet
announcing more than a thousand prefixes.
Diverse IP sources: ASes flagged by our classifier use IP space
spread out across the RIRs—with a median RIR Gini index of 0.675
compared to 0.8 for non-flagged ASes (an RIR Gini index of 0.8
means all prefixes originated by that AS come from only one of
the five RIRs). Flagged ASes also exhibit a larger share of MOAS
address space than non-flagged ASes, resulting in a median MOAS
prefix share of 22.9% vs. 6.9%, respectively.
7.2 Indications of Misconfiguration
We find that some ASes were likely flagged as a result of miscon-
figuration issues in BGP.
Private AS numbers: Per RFC 6996 [35], ASNs [64512, 65534] are
reserved for private use. In the group of flagged ASes, we found 114
private ASNs that appear to have very volatile prefix origination
behavior with relatively low visibility. A possible explanation is that
due to router misconfiguration, these AS numbers appear at the
origin of BGP AS-paths. As many ASes filter out prefixes originated
by known reserved AS numbers, the spread and visibility of these
misconfigurations is often limited. Some of the serial hijackers in
our ground truth dataset exhibit lower visibility too, which is likely
why these behavior got captured by the classifier.
Fat finger errors: Our classifier flagged all of the single-digit AS
numbers. Indeed, the origination behavior of these ASes appears
to be extremely volatile using the longitudinal routing data. We
note however, that apparent origination of prefixes by theses ASes
does not necessarily reflect actual routing decisions by the owner
or network with given AS number. The prefix originations by these
single digit ASes are likely mere results of misconfigurations, where
an origin network accidentally adds an additional AS number (be-
hind its own) to its BGP advertisements. These so-called “fat finger
errors” [15] commonly occur when configuring a router to perform
AS path prepending, a traffic engineering technique that artificially
lengthens the AS path in order to make the advertised path less
desirable in the BGP decision process [44]. A notable example of an
AS flagged by our classifier is AS5, an AS whose registered company
went out of business 20 years ago, periodically revived through
router misconfiguration.
Removing private and single digit ASes from our group of flagged
ASes, 811 remain.
7.3 Benign Serial Hijackers
In our dataset, we find prefixes originated by 29 DDoS protection
networks (e.g., DDoSGuard).8 18 of these ASes are flagged by our
classifier. We find that a significant share of the address space origi-
nated by these networks has MOAS conflicts, representing over 30%
of the prefixes they originate in most cases. The DDoS mitigation
they perform includes originating prefixes of their customers when
a DDoS attack is detected, in order to attract all the traffic destined
to the network under attack, “scrub” it (to remove DDoS traffic),
and tunnel it to the intended final destination [23]. Thus, DDoS
protection networks present a case of “legitimate”, or benign, serial
hijacking behavior.
8Our list of AS numbers of DDoS protection services is manually compiled and hence
not necessarily complete.

Table 3: Summary statistics of selected metrics for ASes flagged as having similar BGP origination behavior to serial hijackers
ASes and non-flagged ASes. Only ASes originating 10 or more prefixes in our dataset (N=19,103) are fed into our classifier. For
each metric, we show the median value across ASes in each group, as well as the 1st and 3rd quartile.
7.4 Indications of Malicious Behavior
After removing private AS numbers, single digit ASes, and DDoS
protection ones, a total of 793 publicly routable ASes flagged by
our classifier remain. Next, we assess if our identified ASes show
indications of malicious behavior, e.g., spam or probing activity.
Flagged ASes in Spamhaus DROP list: First, we leverage snap-
shots of the Spamhaus Don’t Route Or Peer (DROP) ASN list [41],
a list of ASes controlled by “spammers, cyber criminals, and hi-
jackers”. We have access to 6 snapshots taken between January 1st
2017 until early 2019, containing a total of 451 unique ASes, and we
note that 266 of these ASes appear in all snapshots. We compared
the ASes flagged by our classifier with those listed in any of the 6
snapshots of the Spamhaus DROP list we have available, finding
that 84 (10.6%) of our flagged ASes are present in the Spamhaus
DROP list. For comparison, we find only 206 (1.1%) ASes from the
non-flagged group are present in at least one snapshot of the black-
list. Thus, flagged ASes are almost 10 times more likely to be in this
list of spammers, hijackers and cyber criminals. Of the 266 ASes
that are blacklisted in all snapshots of the Spamhaus DROP list, 133
originate more than 10 prefixes during our measurement window,
and are thus in the set of ASes we classified. Our classifier flags
50 of them as exhibiting serial hijacker characteristics. In other
words, based on our feature set, our classifier detects some 38% of
all the ASes with enough BGP activity that repeatedly appear on
this blacklist, an indicator of persistent malicious activity in this
group of ASes.
Spam activity of flagged ASes: We also check for indications
of spam activity in our group of flagged ASes. To this end, we
leverage 2.5 years of snapshots taken 4 times a day from the UCE-
PROTECT [55] Level 2 spam blacklist. Attributing prefix ranges
from the UCEPROTECT blacklist to ASes is challenging in our case,
since our identified ASes are by definition highly volatile and might
only temporarily originate prefixes that are otherwise routed by
different ASes. We first load all prefixes and their origination time
ranges into a prefix trie. We then process the blacklist snapshots,
where we (i) perform a lookup in our trie to see if the particular
blacklisted address block was ever originated by one (or multiple)
flagged AS(es), and (ii) tag a given prefix-origin as blacklisted, if the
prefix was originated by the respective AS at the time it appeared
in the blacklist.9
We find indication of spam activity for more than a third of ASes
flagged by our classifier. Specifically, for 38.3% of our flagged ASes,
we find at least one address block originated and simultaneously
blacklisted. Note that while ASes that are victims of hijacking for
spamming purposes might also appear in spam blacklists, we do
not expect them to consistently appear in multiple blacklist snap-
shots. Indeed, We find that when blacklisted, prefixes originated
by flagged ASes tend to be blacklisted for a larger share of their
advertisement time, i.e., 27% are blacklisted during more than 50%
of their advertisement time, compared to 12% for prefixes originated
by ASes not flagged by our classifier.
7.5 Big Players
To find possible false positives, we inspect large ASes flagged by
our classifier. Using data from CAIDA AS-Rank [4, 31], we find that
4 flagged ASes are in the top 500 ASes by customer cone size, and 21
ASes are in the top 1000. Since it is unlikely that a large prominent
transit provider performs serial hijacking, these are probably false
positives. Nonetheless, the BGP origination behavior of these large
ASes appears to be highly volatile, similar to false positives from
the training sample (cf. § 6). As an example, the median of these
ASes’ median prefix-origin duration is only 69 days compared to
411 for large non-flagged ASes, and they show higher levels of
prefix changes—the rate of normalized monthly prefix changes is
1.0 for large flagged ASes vs. only 0.35 for large non-flagged ASes.
8 CASE STUDIES
In this section, we illustrate three cases of ASes actually misbe-
having, two of which are not in our ground truth dataset but are
instead in the group of ASes identified by our classifier. We picked:
AS197426, a serial hijacker from our ground truth dataset that was
essentially “kicked off the Internet” in July 2018 because of their
repeated malicious behavior [26]; AS19529, an AS flagged by our
classifier for which we subsequently found hijacking complaints in
a RIPE forum; AS134190, another flagged AS, which only recently
started to show characteristics of a potential serial hijacker.
9We allow for 24 hours leeway before and after prefix origination.

8.1 The Quintessential Serial Hijacker
Bitcanal, the “hijack factory”, a Portuguese Web hosting firm, has
been featured in several blog posts [32–34], since it represents a
glaring case of serial hijacking, and one of the few cases in which
prolonged coordinated action among network operators, ISPs, and
IXPs, finally resulted in complete disconnection of the company’s
ASes. Bitcanal leveraged several ASNs: in this case study we fo-
cus on AS197426, the most active ASN used by Bitcanal.10 While
multiple incidents of hijacks carried out by Bitcanal were featured
in numerous blog posts [32–34], we provide a first comprehensive
data-driven assessment of their long-term behavior in the global
routing table, revealing the full extent of persistent hijacking ac-
tivity of this network, i.e., an upwards of 1,500 originated prefixes
over the course of 4 years.
Figure 8a provides a graphical representation of their prefix origi-
nation activity, each row represents a different prefix that AS197426
has originated. In the first snapshot file of our dataset in January
2014, AS197426 originates only 4 prefixes, but its origination activ-
ity soon ramps up. Already in February 2014, the same AS starts
originating 15 prefixes and by October 2014 it originates almost
50 prefixes. The first post about hijacking activity by AS197426
appeared as early as September 2014 stating that it originated un-
routed IP addresses that were allocated to a diverse set of organiza-
tions [32]. And yet, this was only the start of their serial hijacking
spree. Starting in early 2015, we see AS197426 progressively in-
creasing the number of prefixes it originates, and in January 2015,
another blog post described recent hijacks by AS197426. Origina-
tion activity peaks at ≈ 300 prefixes in the second trimester of
2016, see vertical structures in late 2016 in Figure 8a. During this
time, this AS makes an average of 2.5 changes per day in the set of
prefixes they originate. Sometime in 2017, AS197426 was expelled
from the German IXP DE-CIX because of their bad behavior. DE-
CIX collected and analyzed evidence before contacting the AS and
finally suspending their services [3, 24]. On June 25, 2018, a detailed
email thread on the NANOG mailing list described multiple hijacks
carried out by AS197426 and explicitly called out Cogent, GTT, and
10Figure 1b features another Bitcanal AS.
Level3 to act, since they provided transit to AS197426 [20]. Report-
edly, GTT and Cogent quickly suspended their services to Bitcanal.
Then, early in July 2018, Bitcanal appeared using other European
transit providers (see sporadic activity in 2018 in Figure 8a), who
terminated their relationship with Bitcanal only a few days later.
Bitcanal was also present in other European IXPs, including the
large LINX and AMS-IX, who terminated services with Bitcanal
shortly after. The last transit provider disconnected Bitcanal on July
9, 2018. AS197426 has not been visible in the global routing table
since that day.
From 2014 until its disconnection in 2018, our data shows AS197426
originating a total of 1,495 different prefixes. While hijacking activ-
ity was reported as early as September 2014, coordinated measures
only showed effect and resulted in eventual disconnection in 2018.
8.2 A Recent Hijacker
AS19529, originates about a dozen prefixes in our first snapshot in
2014. As Figure 8b shows, 7 of these prefixes were steadily origi-
nated for over a year. In April 2016, we see AS19529 withdrawing
these prefixes and disappearing from (our proxy for) the global
routing table (white gap in Figure 8b). Although the ARIN WHOIS
record [1] for AS19529 has not been updated since 2012, our dataset
shows it returns originating prefixes (31 this time) in November
2017. Then, AS19529 quickly increases the number of prefixes it
originates, reaching almost 60 prefixes by the end of 2017. This
spike in activity is clearly visible in Figure 8b. During these months,
