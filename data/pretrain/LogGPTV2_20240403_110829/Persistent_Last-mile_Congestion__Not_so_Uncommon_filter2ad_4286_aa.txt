## Abstract
The last mile is a critical component of broadband connectivity, as poor performance in this segment often translates to a poor user experience. In this study, we investigate last-mile latency using traceroute data from RIPE Atlas probes located in 646 Autonomous Systems (ASes), with a focus on recurrent performance degradation. Our findings indicate that, under normal conditions, only 10% of ASes experience persistent last-mile congestion. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of congested ASes increased by 55%. Persistent last-mile congestion is not uncommon and is typically observed in large eyeball networks, where it can persist for years. Using CDN access log data, we analyze the major ISPs in Japan, the most severely affected country in our study, and identify bottlenecks in the shared legacy infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction
Internet resources are shared among a diverse range of users with varying demands. The depletion of network resources is the primary cause of packet loss and increased latency, which often results in degraded web services and a poor quality of experience [26]. Understanding the causes of internet congestion and detecting it in both time and space is essential for maintaining service quality.

Previous studies have highlighted the relationship between persistent inter-domain congestion and under-provisioned links [7, 17], and between transient in-network congestion and routing issues [11]. For broadband users, home and last-mile networks are the main bottlenecks [25]. Last-mile networks are also susceptible to transient self-induced congestion [12, 24] and are a key factor in the quality of experience [26]. A recent analysis of access networks in the US and UK suggests that last-mile latency is generally stable and does not feature recurrent congestion [3]. In contrast, our study shows that for some Autonomous Systems (ASes), last-mile congestion can be a pervasive and long-term problem. This paper complements existing literature by documenting persistent last-mile congestion, which refers to congestion near users' premises that recurs over an extended period.

Using RIPE Atlas, we conducted an exploratory survey of last-mile latency in 646 ASes. We found that probes in 90% of monitored ASes exhibited no consistent last-mile congestion, but those with persistent congestion were typically located in large eyeball networks, and the congestion could recur over years. We also observed a 55% increase in the number of ASes hosting congested Atlas probes during the COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we present a case study focused on major Japanese ISPs, showing that CDN access logs support our findings. Our comparison of different access technologies in Japan highlights the extensive use of shared legacy infrastructure over PPPoE and indicates that wired broadband throughput for some ISPs is consistently lower than LTE during peak hours.

This work provides valuable insights to the operational community with the following research contributions:
- We propose (§2) and validate (§4) a methodology to measure persistent last-mile congestion. Our tools are publicly available, allowing for reproducibility and extension of our experiments [16].
- We report last-mile conditions in 2018 and 2019 for Atlas probes located in 646 ASes and 98 countries, and estimate the impact of COVID-19 on last-mile latencies (§3). These surveys are available on a public server [1].
- Our case study illustrates how a nationwide infrastructure, which successfully opened the telecommunications market to competition [9], is now struggling to meet increasing demand (§4). Given the extent of this proprietary infrastructure and the difficulties in upgrading it, we emphasize the importance of scalability and upgradability in these deployments.
- Finally, we provide recommendations for handling persistent last-mile congestion in delay measurements with RIPE Atlas and discuss the adverse consequences of BBR in this context (§6).

## 2. From Traceroute to Last-mile Congestion
With over ten thousand probes deployed worldwide, the RIPE Atlas measurement platform is ideal for surveying last-mile conditions in numerous ASes. Since our interest lies in the segment closest to the probes, we can utilize the extensive public measurement data offered by Atlas. We fetched data from the 22 IPv4 built-in traceroute measurements [22] to obtain a steady number of RTT samples. These measurements are executed by all probes towards all root DNS servers and RIPE Atlas controllers every 30 minutes, and two randomly selected addresses every 15 minutes.

For our experiments, we filtered out undesired traceroutes. First, we ignored traceroutes from Atlas anchors, as these probes are typically located in data centers without typical last-mile connectivity. Second, for each probe, we grouped its traceroutes into 30-minute time bins and discarded bins with fewer than three traceroutes. This check ensures that the Atlas probe is operating normally during the time bin, thus avoiding incorrect inferences from disconnected probes. We also used large time bins (30 minutes) to filter out transient congestion and focus on long-lasting congestion.

Although past research has shown that v1 and v2 probes can be less reliable [13], in our experiments, we observed only slight differences in our aggregated results when using these probes. As a trade-off between precision and coverage, we avoided using these probes when not necessary (§4) but included them when surveying last-mile latency at a large scale (§3).

In this paper, we focus on eight measurement periods. Six periods are used for longitudinal analysis, representing the 1st to the 15th of March, June, and September in 2018 and 2019. We assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown using traceroutes collected from the 1st to the 15th of April 2020. Finally, we collect traceroute data during the time period covered by the CDN log data employed in §4. To avoid confusion, all dates are in UTC.

### 2.1 Estimating Last-mile RTT
The last mile is generally considered the segment connecting the probe's premises to the ISP's IP infrastructure. In practice, we identify the ISP edge infrastructure as the first public IP address seen in the traceroute (i.e., not a RFC1918 private address). We noticed that some of these IP addresses are not announced on BGP, so when we need to identify the ASN corresponding to the last mile, we use the probe's public address for the longest prefix match with BGP data.

To estimate the last-mile RTT, we subtract the RTT of the last private IP from the identified first public IP RTT. Previous work has shown that this is a practical estimate when paths are symmetric [7, 11], which is expected for private LANs hosting Atlas probes.

Using the traceroute dataset mentioned above, we obtained 24 traceroutes every 30 minutes and computed 9 RTT samples per traceroute (pairwise subtraction of the 3 RTTs for each of the last private IP and the first public IP), resulting in 216 samples per probe. To filter out noise, as in [11], we computed the median RTT per probe in 30-minute time bins.

Congestion is monitored by estimating the deviation (i.e., queuing delay) from a base latency (i.e., propagation delay). To measure these delay changes, we subtract the minimum median RTT value from all median RTT values for each probe. The minimum median RTT is computed separately for each measurement period to account for changes in Atlas probe deployment. Consequently, we obtain a rough estimate of last-mile queuing delay for each probe, where the lowest point is set to zero, and other values correspond to delay increases in milliseconds.

Finally, we derive the overall last-mile conditions from a population of probes. In this paper, we select a population of probes based on their ASN (§3) or their ASN and geographical location (§4). To combine delays from a population, we compute the median value across all last-mile queuing delay estimates from that population. This gives us an aggregated queuing delay, where large fluctuations reveal times when the majority of probes experience high latency.

### 2.2 Examples
To provide a concrete example, we present results from two large eyeball networks hosting numerous Atlas probes. One is located in the U.S.A. (referred to as ISP US) and the other in Germany (ISP DE).

Figure 1 depicts the aggregated queuing delay for each measurement period and AS. For ISP DE (upper plot), we observe very stable delays for all measurement periods. Even in April 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown, there was no significant change. These results and our large-scale survey (§3) support previous observations [3] by showing that last-mile RTTs are usually stable.

For some networks, however, we found interesting patterns revealing persistent delay increases. For example, ISP US (Fig. 1, lower plot) features a small but consistent diurnal pattern during 2018 and 2019. In April 2020, this pattern became more pronounced, with peak hours extending over daytime. As discussed in §3, we attribute this to the impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns. The aggregated queuing delay increase is small, only over 1ms during peak hours, but looking at the delays of each probe, we observe that the proportion of probes experiencing daily queuing delays over 5ms tripled compared to 2018 and 2019, representing a quarter of the probes in 2020.

We highlight two key observations: (1) Similar to persistent inter-domain congestion [7], persistent last-mile congestion is characterized by a clear daily pattern, and (2) these two types of congestion differ in amplitude. In the case of last-mile congestion, we aggregate delays from numerous links, so unless most links are congested, we measure only small aggregated variations. In §4, we show that significant throughput drops occur when aggregated delays exceed 1ms. Furthermore, our metrics are designed to be robust to outliers, thus only long-lasting congestion across multiple probes is detected.
