Currently, each RESTStorage implementation has its own storage object, which
eventually ends up being the same etcd instance for all components.
We should consider instead having apiserver pass a storage destination into
each RESTStorage method. This would make it much more clear how to write
plugins, both those that you compile into the master binary, and those that
are external binaries.
This would also let us eventually do fancy things like sharding (or isolating)
keys across different etcd clusters without having to make sweeping changes to
all the storage objects.
(See #1355, which sparked this)
