from booter B. We use all booter services to launch attacks against
our measurement infrastructure. However, for the remainder of
this section we only consider attacks with relevant traffic volumes.
These are mostly NTP based amplification attacks, whereas also
CLDAP, DNS, and memcached-based attacks are offered.
Attacking our infrastructure. For our analysis, we passively cap-
ture all traffic of the measurement platform. In addition, we obtain
sampled flow traces of the IXP for traffic directed to our server
and are therefore able to measure attack traffic exceeding the ca-
pacity of 10 Gbps. The BGP router of our measurement platform
announces a /24 IPv4 prefix and peers with a transit provider and
all IXP customers in a multilateral peering configuration via the
IXP’s BGP reflector [41]. This provides us with a similar network
setup compared to small to medium-sized organizations connected
to the Internet. For each attack, we select a new IP out of our /24
prefix to isolate each individual measurement and to not confuse
different attacks within our traffic captures. We perform a post
mortem analysis of the passively measured attacks and derive the
attack traffic volume and their network properties (e.g., number of
servers used for reflection, number of ASes handing over traffic).
Ethical considerations. We perform controlled DDoS experiments
towards our measurement platform. To comply with measurements
ethics we (a) inform and synchronize with national authorities re-
garding legal/ethical implications of buying booter services, (b) min-
imize payments to booter services by limiting the number of differ-
ent booters and offered service plans we buy (indicated in bold in
Table 1), (c) inform and synchronize with the IXP operator and up-
stream provider about attacks, (d) take precaution that sufficient IXP
network bandwidth is available to minimize the influence on other
IXP members, (e) use an experimental AS with no customer traffic,
(f) utilize an unused /24 prefix that was allocated and announced
only for the experiment, (g) are prepared to shut down the experi-
mental AS and immediately stop attack traffic by withdrawing and
blackholing the /24 in case of unexpected high traffic volumes or
IXP members being negatively effected by our experiment (never
occurred), and (h) minimize the experiment duration.
3.2 Self-Attack Observations
Attack traffic of non-VIP services. We show the results of 10
self-attacks on our measurement platform by non-VIP booter ser-
vices in Figure 1(a). It shows the received traffic volume per second
(y-axis) for each attack. On the x-axis we display the number of
observed reflectors (left plot) together with the number of neigh-
boring ASes from which we receive the traffic (right plot). Each
data point represents one second of a measurement. In terms of
attack traffic volume, we find that during the attacks traffic levels
of up to ∼2000 Mbps are prevalent with a mean of 1440 Mbps but

booters B and A peak at 7078 Mbps. These are the highest traffic
levels reported during a non-VIP booter attack to date [47]. When
we focus on the number of reflectors and peers from which the
traffic is coming, we find that most booter attacks utilize between
∼100 and ∼1000 reflectors distributed over 20–55 peer ASes (avg.
346 and 27 respectively). However, when we instantiate booter B
to use the connectionless LDAP (CLDAP) protocol the number of
reflectors is 3519 distributed across 72 peer ASes. Thus, we learn
that the protocol used for amplification seems to have an effect
on the number of reflectors and IXP members transmitting traffic.
Finally, we observe that NTP amplification attacks are the most
potent attacks delivered by the booters included in our tests.
We next study how the attack traffic is handed over to our AS at
the IXP, i.e., which fraction is received via transit and via peering.
To first study the maximum traffic that can be received via peering
at the present IXP, we perform three attacks solely via IXP peering
and with disabled transit link (indicated as “no transit”) in Figure 4).
This enforces the usage of peering links even if the transit link
would have been a better routing option. In this case, the number
of individual IXP members (peers) sending traffic increases from
below 30 to above 40 when the transit link is deactivated. While the
handover traffic spreads now over more peers, the absence of a full
routing table limits the reachability of our AS when the transit link
is disabled. Consequently, we receive less attack traffic, e.g., the
NTP attack volume of booter A decreases from up to 7 Gbps to less
than 3 Gbps (see Figure 1(a)). For NTP attacks with enabled transit,
we now receive most traffic through the transit link (avg. 80.81%)
compared to the multilateral peerings at the IXP (avg. 19.19%).
Thus, the attack traffic volumes reported in Section 4 captured at
the peering platform of the IXP will likely underestimate the true
attack sizes as the traces do not contain the customers’ transit links.
Attack traffic of VIP services. Booter services advertise higher
priced premium services. For booter B, VIP offerings charge 178.84$
compared to 19.83$ and promise higher attack traffic rates of 80–100
Gbps instead of 8–12 Gbps for non-VIP services. We validate this
claim and launch two VIP attacks from booter B. In Figure 1(b), we
show that the NTP (blue line) and Memcached (red line) attacks
generated traffic rates with a peak of about 20 Gbps and 10 Gbps,
respectively. We configure both attacks to last for 5 min. The sudden
drop in attack for the NTP traffic is due to a flapping BGP session
with our transit provider because of the saturation of our measure-
ment interface. The majority of NTP traffic (80.81%) is delivered
3
by our transit provider, the remaining 19.19% are received over
the IXP peering. Interestingly, 45.55% of the peering traffic (8.73%
over all) is coming from one AS while the median share per peer
is 0.22%. Through the observations of the Memcached attack, we
notice a shift of more traffic being transfered via the IXP peering
(88.59%), while one member alone accounts for 33.58% of the total
attack traffic. We assume that at the time this specific IXP member
was exploited for Memcached amplification attacks. The observed
traffic rates are significantly larger than the non-VIP booter attacks,
but never reach the claimed bandwidth nor the advertised multi-
plication factors. Indeed, we experience only roughly 25% of the
traffic rate compared to that which was advertised.
Amplification overlap. Next we study how the different booters
are related and to what extent they share the same amplifiers. We fo-
cus on NTP amplification attacks and compare the sets of reflectors
used for the attacks. Figure 1(c) depicts 16 independent self-attacks
and the overlap of the NTP reflectors sorted by date. We find stable
set of reflectors for Booter B with moderate churn of around 30%
over a time frame of two weeks (1), which suddenly uses a new
set of reflectors (for booter B from 18-06-12 to 18-06-13). We also
observe a churning set of reflectors over a long period (2). The part
marked by (3) shows same day measurements with a high overlap,
which indicates a stability over short time frames and allows us to
conclude that this booter doesn’t randomly select reflectors from a
larger set of reflectors, but uses the same reflectors for attacks in
this time frame. Moreover reflectors occasionally overlap between
booter services (4). Interestingly, the VIP and non-VIP services use
the same set of reflectors. The difference in attack traffic is gen-
erated by a higher packet rate (5.3M pps compared to 2.2M pps).
Moreover, the number of the reflectors used by booters is fairly
low (in total 868) compared to the globally available set of potential
amplifiers (e.g., 9M potentially usable NTP servers according to
shodan.io on May 12 2019). We conclude that identifying booter
services according to their reflectors is difficult because reflectors
are rotating quickly, are overlapping between different services and
suddenly start using a new set of reflectors. Ultimately, this makes
it impossible to identify specific booter traffic at a later point in
time by using the set of reflectors we learn from the self-attacks.
Takeaway. Booters enable anyone to launch Gbps-scale DDoS for
few dollars only. We measure higher attack volumes than previously
reported (1.4 Gbps) [47], even with non VIP-services. We are the first
to report the capabilities of a VIP booter services that peak at about

20 Gbps. These traffic volumes are sufficient to take down web ser-
vices and significantly disturb the operation of inter-domain links
and Internet infrastructure. We further find NTP-based amplification
attacks to provide the most potent and reliable type of booter attacks.
We believe this is because NTP amplifiers are more widespread and
stable, while Memcached amplifiers focus on fewer networks, which
in turn detect abuse more quickly and mitigate the problem.
4 DDOS AMPLIFICATION TRAFFIC
Next, we study DDoS amplification traffic at our vantage points,
i.e., a Tier-1 & Tier-2 ISP, and an IXP. We focus our discussion
on NTP traffic only, since most reliable booter-spawned attacks
were executed over NTP. This analysis highlights the prevalence of
attack traffic at our vantage points and continues to define filtering
criteria before we study the FBI takedown in the next section.
Optimistic NTP DDoS classification. In our self-attacks we ob-
served amplified NTP packets to have a size of either 486 or 490
bytes (98.62% over all observed packets) due to monlist requests. To
put this in context of a realistic NTP traffic mix, we show the distri-
