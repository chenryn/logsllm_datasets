### Attacking Our Infrastructure

For our analysis, we passively capture all traffic on the measurement platform. Additionally, we obtain sampled flow traces from the IXP for traffic directed to our server, allowing us to measure attack traffic exceeding the 10 Gbps capacity. The BGP router of our measurement platform announces a /24 IPv4 prefix and peers with a transit provider and all IXP customers via the IXP’s BGP reflector [41]. This setup mimics the network configuration of small to medium-sized organizations connected to the Internet. For each attack, we select a new IP from our /24 prefix to isolate individual measurements and avoid confusion in our traffic captures. We perform a post-mortem analysis of the passively measured attacks, deriving the attack traffic volume and their network properties (e.g., number of servers used for reflection, number of ASes handling traffic).

### Ethical Considerations

We conduct controlled DDoS experiments towards our measurement platform. To comply with ethical standards, we:
1. Inform and synchronize with national authorities regarding legal and ethical implications.
2. Minimize payments to booter services by limiting the number of different booters and service plans (indicated in bold in Table 1).
3. Inform and synchronize with the IXP operator and upstream provider about the attacks.
4. Ensure sufficient IXP network bandwidth is available to minimize the impact on other IXP members.
5. Use an experimental AS with no customer traffic.
6. Utilize an unused /24 prefix allocated and announced only for the experiment.
7. Prepare to shut down the experimental AS and immediately stop attack traffic by withdrawing and blackholing the /24 in case of unexpected high traffic volumes or negative effects on IXP members (which did not occur).
8. Minimize the duration of the experiment.

### 3.2 Self-Attack Observations

#### Attack Traffic of Non-VIP Services

Figure 1(a) shows the results of 10 self-attacks on our measurement platform using non-VIP booter services. The y-axis represents the received traffic volume per second, and the x-axis displays the number of observed reflectors (left plot) and the number of neighboring ASes from which we receive the traffic (right plot). Each data point represents one second of a measurement.

In terms of attack traffic volume, we find that during the attacks, traffic levels of up to approximately 2000 Mbps are prevalent, with a mean of 1440 Mbps. Booters B and A peak at 7078 Mbps, the highest traffic levels reported for non-VIP booter attacks to date [47].

When focusing on the number of reflectors and peers, most booter attacks utilize between approximately 100 and 1000 reflectors distributed over 20–55 peer ASes (average of 346 and 27, respectively). However, when booter B uses the connectionless LDAP (CLDAP) protocol, the number of reflectors increases to 3519, distributed across 72 peer ASes. This indicates that the protocol used for amplification affects the number of reflectors and IXP members transmitting traffic.

NTP amplification attacks are the most potent attacks delivered by the booters included in our tests.

#### Attack Traffic Handover at the IXP

To study how attack traffic is handed over to our AS at the IXP, we perform three attacks solely via IXP peering with the transit link disabled (indicated as "no transit" in Figure 4). This enforces the usage of peering links even if the transit link would have been a better routing option. In this case, the number of individual IXP members (peers) sending traffic increases from below 30 to above 40 when the transit link is deactivated. While the handover traffic spreads over more peers, the absence of a full routing table limits the reachability of our AS. Consequently, we receive less attack traffic; for example, the NTP attack volume of booter A decreases from up to 7 Gbps to less than 3 Gbps (see Figure 1(a)).

For NTP attacks with enabled transit, we receive most traffic through the transit link (average 80.81%) compared to the multilateral peerings at the IXP (average 19.19%). Thus, the attack traffic volumes captured at the IXP's peering platform in Section 4 likely underestimate the true attack sizes, as the traces do not include the customers' transit links.

#### Attack Traffic of VIP Services

Booter services advertise higher-priced premium services. For booter B, VIP offerings charge $178.84 compared to $19.83 and promise higher attack traffic rates of 80–100 Gbps instead of 8–12 Gbps for non-VIP services. We validate this claim and launch two VIP attacks from booter B. Figure 1(b) shows that the NTP (blue line) and Memcached (red line) attacks generated traffic rates with peaks of about 20 Gbps and 10 Gbps, respectively. Both attacks were configured to last for 5 minutes.

The sudden drop in NTP attack traffic is due to a flapping BGP session with our transit provider caused by the saturation of our measurement interface. The majority of NTP traffic (80.81%) is delivered by our transit provider, with the remaining 19.19% received over the IXP peering. Interestingly, 45.55% of the peering traffic (8.73% overall) comes from one AS, while the median share per peer is 0.22%.

Through the observations of the Memcached attack, we notice a shift of more traffic being transferred via the IXP peering (88.59%), with one member alone accounting for 33.58% of the total attack traffic. We assume that this specific IXP member was exploited for Memcached amplification attacks at the time. The observed traffic rates are significantly larger than non-VIP booter attacks but never reach the claimed bandwidth nor the advertised multiplication factors. We experience only roughly 25% of the traffic rate compared to what was advertised.

#### Amplification Overlap

Next, we study the relationship between different booters and the extent to which they share the same amplifiers, focusing on NTP amplification attacks. Figure 1(c) depicts 16 independent self-attacks and the overlap of NTP reflectors sorted by date. We find a stable set of reflectors for Booter B with moderate churn of around 30% over a two-week period (1), which suddenly uses a new set of reflectors (for booter B from 18-06-12 to 18-06-13). We also observe a churning set of reflectors over a long period (2). The part marked by (3) shows same-day measurements with a high overlap, indicating stability over short time frames and suggesting that this booter does not randomly select reflectors but uses the same reflectors for attacks in this time frame. Moreover, reflectors occasionally overlap between booter services (4). Interestingly, VIP and non-VIP services use the same set of reflectors. The difference in attack traffic is generated by a higher packet rate (5.3M pps compared to 2.2M pps).

The number of reflectors used by booters is relatively low (in total 868) compared to the globally available set of potential amplifiers (e.g., 9M potentially usable NTP servers according to shodan.io on May 12, 2019). We conclude that identifying booter services based on their reflectors is difficult because reflectors rotate quickly, overlap between different services, and suddenly start using a new set of reflectors. This makes it impossible to identify specific booter traffic at a later point in time using the set of reflectors learned from self-attacks.

### Takeaway

Booters enable anyone to launch Gbps-scale DDoS attacks for a few dollars. We measure higher attack volumes than previously reported (1.4 Gbps) [47], even with non-VIP services. We are the first to report the capabilities of VIP booter services, which peak at about 20 Gbps. These traffic volumes are sufficient to take down web services and significantly disturb the operation of inter-domain links and Internet infrastructure. We find NTP-based amplification attacks to be the most potent and reliable type of booter attacks, likely due to the widespread and stable nature of NTP amplifiers, while Memcached amplifiers are fewer and more quickly detected and mitigated.

### 4. DDoS Amplification Traffic

Next, we study DDoS amplification traffic at our vantage points, including a Tier-1 & Tier-2 ISP, and an IXP. We focus our discussion on NTP traffic, as most reliable booter-spawned attacks were executed over NTP. This analysis highlights the prevalence of attack traffic at our vantage points and continues to define filtering criteria before we study the FBI takedown in the next section.

#### Optimistic NTP DDoS Classification

In our self-attacks, we observed amplified NTP packets to have a size of either 486 or 490 bytes (98.62% of all observed packets) due to monlist requests. To put this in context, we show the distribution of NTP packet sizes in a realistic traffic mix.
