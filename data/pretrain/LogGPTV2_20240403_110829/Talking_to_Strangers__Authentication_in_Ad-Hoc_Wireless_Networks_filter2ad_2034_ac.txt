Our proposal is based on the Guy Fawkes protocol [1],
originally designed for authenticating digital streams. The
Guy Fawkes protocol assumes that parties A and B
want to exchange streams consisting of sequential blocks
respectively. At step i, A

sends to B a packet Pi containing 4 pieces of data: block
Ai; a random value Xi, used as an authenticator for Ai; the
digest of the next authenticator h
; and the digest of
the message ai
. (B does the

same.) Assuming that B received an authenticated packet
Pi, B can authenticate it as soon as it receives it, because Pi

contained the digest ai
that this claim does not hold if A and B do not execute in
lock-step, and the authenticators are revealed before they
should be (see [2] for details of such an attack). Finally,
this protocol requires both A and B to know, one step ahead
of time, what they want to say next, which makes the pro-
tocol unsuitable for interactive exchanges.

We modify the protocol
to accommodate interactive
communication. The key idea consists of having A (respec-
tively B) commit to (and later send) a meaningless random
message to B (respectively A) whenever A (respectively B)
is not in a position to know what to say next. A is in such a
position after he has sent a meaningful message, but before
he has received a (meaningful) reply from B.
Figure 4 shows the modiÔ¨Åed protocol. Over the location-
limited channel, A and B send the digest of the Ô¨Årst secrets
(authenticators) they will use to authenticate their Ô¨Årst mes-
sages (h
, respectively) together with the di-
gests of their Ô¨Årst messages (a1 and b1). They then continue
the communication using the main wireless medium, re-
and h

vealing the messages they committed to over the location-
limited channel.
In round 1, as the initiator of the communication, A sends
a meaningful message A1 to B. The reply B provides (B1)
is meaningless.
It has to be meaningless because it was
committed to in round 0, when B did not know message
A1. In round 2, A sends a meaningless message A2. It has
to be meaningless because it is B‚Äôs turn to ‚Äútalk‚Äù. B then
sends B2, which is a meaningful message. Note that it was
committed to in round 1, right after B learned the message
A1. In round 3, A3 is meaningless. It has to be because it
was committed to in round 2, while A had not received B2.
However, A can now commit to a meaningful message A4
because he has learned what B had to say in round 2. B3 is
meaningless because the next to ‚Äútalk‚Äù is A. In round 4, A
‚Äútalks‚Äù again and the protocol repeats itself. Note that the
protocol does not actually require the presence of mean-
ingless random messages to work: these messages can be
replaced by empty messages.
Note that this interactive protocol, as well as the original
non-interactive Guy Fawkes protocol, provides integrity
protection and authentication, but cannot provide encryp-
tion. (See [1] for a security analysis of the Guy Fawkes
protocol.) If the location-limited channel being used is be-
lieved to provide secrecy as well as integrity (e.g., contact),
it is possible to directly exchange a secret key across that
channel, and use the key to encrypt further communica-
tions. However, such a direct exchange of secrets is vulner-
able to passive eavesdropping in the location-limited chan-
nel, whereas the interactive Guy Fawkes protocol is not.

4. Group Key Exchange Protocols
Some of the location-limited channels we have identi-
Ô¨Åed have broadcast capability ‚Äì they can reach more than
one target simultaneously. Using such broadcast chan-
nels, we can construct protocols that provide authenticated
group communication. There are a number of applica-
tions that would beneÔ¨Åt from the ability to rapidly and
easily designate a group of users or devices to participate
in a secure network ‚Äì networked games and meeting sup-
port/conferencing software being the two most obvious.
Audio, in particular, is a medium that can provide signif-
icant advantages when used as a broadcast location-limited
channel [16]. First, it can be monitored and tracked by hu-
mans ‚Äì even if the people involved in the exchange do not
know exactly what is carried in the audio messages, they
can recognize that legitimate group participants ought to
be sending them and the potted plant in the corner should
not. Second, it can be incorporated into sounds that are al-
ready used by many pieces of software to provide feedback
to humans ‚Äì for instance, most corporate conference call
settings play a short ‚Äújoin tone‚Äù whenever a new participant
enters a call; such tones could be altered to also contain that
participant‚Äôs keying information. Third, because there are
already designated channels designed to carry audio/voice
information, it can actually be used via the telephone net-
work (assuming one places reasonable trust in the carrier).
Audio is in some sense the canonical non-secret chan-
nel ‚Äì it is literally possible to eavesdrop on communicated
data. In using it as a pre-authentication channel we rely on
the fact that our protocols are designed to be impervious to
passive (eavesdropping) attackers. We defend against ac-
tive attackers by emphasizing the ability of legitimate par-
ticipants (human or device) to detect these illegitimate mes-
sages and abort the protocol (see Section 2).
As in the two-party case above, our goal is to use
location-limited channels to authenticate secure key ex-
changes using well-established and trusted protocols.
In
this section, we investigate various options for pre-
authenticating group communication. We will show how
to use pre-authentication schemes with the two major fam-
ilies of group key exchange protocols: those that designate
a specially-trusted group member, or ‚ÄúGroup Manager‚Äù, to
distribute group keys, and those that do not.
4.1. Centrally Managed Groups
Figure 5 illustrates the setting for a centrally-managed
group key exchange, and Figure 6 shows a straightforward
example of a protocol involving pre-authentication. One
participant is designated to become the manager (e.g., the
Ô¨Årst to pre-authenticate, or a more complicated scheme can
be used to elect a random participant). The group manager
then establishes point-to-point links with every other par-
ticipant using the two-party protocols described above. For
efÔ¨Åciency, if the Ô¨Årst member to broadcast is designated as
the group manager, all participants after the Ô¨Årst can use a
digest-based authentication scheme (see Section 3.2).
In a centrally managed group, managing joining and
leaving members is relatively easy. In the simplest possible
approach, a joining member can use the two-party proto-
