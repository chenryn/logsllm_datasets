### Battery Node and Aging Management

The battery node is selected based on a minimal weighted aging value, similar to the aging hiding technique, which considers factors such as NAT (Number of Charge Cycles), CF (Charge Factor), and PC (Percentage of Time at High State of Charge). If VM migration is not feasible due to resource constraints elsewhere in the datacenter (e.g., CPU, Memory, or Disk limitations), we employ Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) on servers to reduce power demand. This approach enhances the likelihood of battery charging to a higher State of Charge (SoC) when intermittent power supply becomes sufficient again. However, DVFS may lead to performance degradation, so VM migration is preferred to minimize performance penalties. The details of our slowdown aging policy are illustrated in Figure 9.

### Planned Aging: Aging Rate Management

Battery aging and datacenter infrastructure aging occur at different rates. Typically, batteries age faster than servers and other IT equipment. As a result, datacenter operators may need to discard batteries before the end of their expected lifespan, leading to wasted performance if the focus is excessively on slowing down battery aging. If the battery's end-of-life is known, we can use the Battery-Aware Aging Technique (BAAT) to "shift" some performance from the unused portion of the batteryâ€™s lifetime to the used time, a concept referred to as planned aging.

Figure 10 presents cycle life data from various manufacturers (Hoppecke Battery, Trojan Battery, and UPG Battery). It shows that the battery cycle life decreases by 50% if frequently discharged at a Depth of Discharge (DoD) above 50%. Our goal is to apply planned aging techniques to ensure the battery is aggressively used before being discarded. By regulating the battery DoD, we can control the battery aging rate. We leverage the battery Ah-throughput to plan the battery aging rate effectively.

### Full-System Implementation of BAAT

Our full-system implementation of BAAT, shown in Figure 11, includes six major functional modules:

1. **Server Rack**: Houses the computing nodes.
2. **Solar Panels**: Provide renewable energy.
3. **Battery Array**: Consists of twelve 12V 35Ah sealed lead-acid batteries.
4. **Sensor Devices**: Collect battery voltage, current, and temperature.
5. **Control Server**: A customized low-power Intel i7 server for monitoring and control.
6. **Power Switcher**: Dynamically switches between utility, battery, and renewable power.
7. **Computing Nodes**: Three IBM X series 330 and three HP ProLiant servers.
8. **Display Module**: Visualizes sensor data and aging metrics in real-time.

The power switcher can dynamically switch power sources among utility, battery, and renewable energy. It also controls the charging of batteries via SNMP commands over Ethernet. The display module visualizes data captured by sensors and aging impact factors calculated by the control server in real-time using LabVIEW.

### Workload Deployment

We deploy six datacenter workloads, including three from HiBench (Nutch Indexing, K-Means Clustering, and Word Count) and three from CloudSuite (Software Testing, Web Serving, and Data Analytic). These workloads represent large-scale search indexing, machine learning, MapReduce jobs, and popular cloud applications. Xen 4.1.2 hypervisor is used as the virtual machine monitor (VMM), and all workloads are hosted in VMs, allowing easy management through spawning, pausing, and migration.

### Evaluation Results

#### Comparison of Power Management Schemes

We compare BAAT with three baseline power management policies: e-Buff, BAAT-s, and BAAT-h (Table IV). e-Buff aggressively uses battery energy to manage power mismatches, while BAAT-s and BAAT-h focus on slowing down and hiding battery aging, respectively.

#### System Runtime Profiling

We profile the system runtime across different solar generation scenarios. The usage frequency of the six battery packs varies significantly due to intermittent solar power and varying server power demands, leading to different battery aging rates. Figures 12(a) to 12(k) show the variation of several aging-related metrics under different weather conditions. For example, in sunny days, the battery nodes yield less Ah-throughput, have a higher CF, and stay in high SoC regions, resulting in less aging decay compared to cloudy and rainy days.

#### Aging Progress Comparison

We evaluate the impact of different power management schemes on battery aging progress by comparing aging metrics under typical weather conditions (sunny and cloudy days) and battery aging stages (new and aged batteries). Our results show that BAAT effectively combines load power profiling information and weighted aging ranking to hide and slow down battery aging, as illustrated in Figures 12(e) to 12(g).

By employing these strategies, our system can efficiently manage battery aging and optimize the overall performance and longevity of the datacenter infrastructure.
