Figure 3: CCDF of the node degree of ASes connected to route collectors
these diﬀerent classes of BGP feeders is their node degree
distribution (Fig. 3), which is computed on the union of
the AS-level topologies inferred from RouteViews, RIS and
PCH datasets. In each project the full feeder set is mainly
composed of ASes that have developed a large number of
BGP connections, which is a typical behavior of transit ISPs.
To conﬁrm this, we analysed the nature of these ASes by
browsing their websites and parsing their entries in the IRRs.
We found that 10 out of 13 Tier-1 ASes3 are well-known
national/international ISPs.
Since the vast majority of full feeders are large ISPs, the
view of the Internet (at the AS-level) extracted from these
projects is likely to represent more the Internet viewed by
some of the most important ISPs in the world rather than
the real Internet. A view of the Internet from the top of
the AS hierarchy is not able to discover a large number of
connections. In fact, due to BGP export policies, a route
collector connected with ASes that are part of the top of
the hierarchy is not able to reveal all the p2p connections
that are established at the lower levels. On the other hand,
the lower in the hierarchy the BGP feeder is located, the
greater the chance to gathering information about an AS
path involving a previously hidden p2p connection. Con-
sider for example Fig. 4. In this case, if the route collector
R is connected to AS E at the top of the hierarchy, it cannot
reveal either the p2p connection between A and B, or the
p2p connection between C and D. On the other hand, if
R is connected to AS A, it can reveal the p2p connection
between A and B, but not between C and D. It is funda-
mental that the route collector establishes a c2p relationship
with its feeders. Otherwise, even if the route collector is con-
nected to A, the connection (A, B) will not be revealed. A
real example of the importance of obtaining the full routing
table from BGP feeders located in the lowest part of the In-
ternet hierarchy is represented by PCH. This data source is
potentially extremely useful for discovering hidden AS con-
nections, since its route collectors are deployed on 51 diﬀer-
ent IXPs and connected to 1,697 ASes, about three times
the total number of BGP feeders of RIS and RouteViews.
In addition, many of its BGP feeders have small node degree
value (Fig. 3), which is a rough indication of their location
at the bottom of the Internet hierarchy.
Nevertheless, as shown in Table 2, the number of AS con-
nections detected by BGP data gathered by PCH and not
discovered by RouteViews and RIS is extremely low, since
84,037 connection out of the total 85,674 discovered connec-
tions are already revealed by RouteViews and/or RIS. This
happens because PCH mainly establishes p2p connections
with its BGP feeders, i.e.
its route collectors obtain only
the routes announced by the customers of its BGP feeders.
Consequently, it is likely that almost every connection found
by PCH represents a p2c (c2p) economic agreement. Thus
the issue of p2p connection discovery has not been solved
even though it currently represents the largest set of hidden
connections [6, 7, 19], greatly limiting the topology discovery
potentiality of its route collectors.
A deeper insight into the amount of information provided
by each BGP feeder can be found by analysing the diﬀerence
between the direct node degree and the inner node degree

(Fig. 5). The direct node degree of a BGP feeder X is
deﬁned as the cardinality of the set of its neighbors that
are discovered using only BGP data directly announced by
X to a route collector, and the inner node degree of X is
deﬁned as the cardinality of the set of its neighbors that are
discovered using BGP data announced by every BGP feeder
but X. A similar approach was proposed in [20], but with a
diﬀerent purpose.
It is thus possible to diﬀerentiate between two diﬀerent
classes of behavior of BGP feeders: a) ASes that announce
just a partial view of the Internet (degree diﬀerence  0), such as p2p and
p2c connections that are hidden from the other BGP feeders
due to the eﬀect of BGP export policies crossed during the
propagation of the routing information.
The ﬁrst class is typical of minor feeders, whose connec-
tivity is mostly discovered via other feeders (Fig. 5). On the
other hand, the second class is typical of full feeders, that
typically introduce previously undiscovered AS connections
involving them.
However, some full feeders partially hide some of their
interconnectivity despite advertising their full routing ta-
ble to a route collector project. This phenomenon has been
recorded in about 20% of the full feeders (see negative values
of degree diﬀerence in Fig. 5) and is caused by the BGP de-
cision process on the feeder side. Depending on the policies
established among ASes and on technical decisions, some di-
rect connections may not be announced to the route collec-
tor. However, for the same economic and technical reasons
it is possible that the same direct connections hidden from
the route collector are announced to other neighbors, prop-
agated on the Internet, and ﬁnally detected by the route
collector from another feeder as a side eﬀect. Some other
slight exceptions are related to minor and partial feeders
with a positive degree diﬀerence (less than 5%). These feed-
ers are likely to be located in the bottom part of the Inter-
net hierarchy and some of their p2c connections may result
as hidden to the route collector infrastructure because of
the cross eﬀect of their multi-homed nature and of multiple
BGP decision process crossed by UPDATE messages before
reaching the route collector infrastructure.
This last phenomenon highlights that the presence of mul-
tiple BGP decision processes along the AS path may limit
the completeness of AS-level topology collected, since each
BGP AS border router selects and announces only the best
route per-destination (RFC 4271) to their neighbors.
In
summary, the information that a BGP feeder announces to
the route collector is the result of its BGP decision process
which, in turn, is fed only with routes that are the result
of the BGP decision processes of its neighboring ASes, and
so on. Each BGP decision process, from an AS-level mea-
surement perspective, is a route ﬁlter, which can potentially
reduce the AS-level connectivity information received from
each route collector. As a consequence, the higher the dis-
