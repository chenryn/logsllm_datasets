Theorem 8. The following relations hold.
(i) (1-IND → u-IND) For all signature schemes SS and all SA classes A against SS, if SS
is 1-user indistinguishable w.r.t. continuous A-SAs, then, for any u ∈ poly(κ), it is also
u-users indistinguishable w.r.t. continuous A-SAs.

(ii) (1-IMP (cid:57) 1-IND) Assuming the existence of EUF-CMA signature schemes, there exist a
signature scheme SS and a SA class A against SS such that SS is 1-user EUF-CMA
w.r.t. continuous A-SAs, but it is not 1-user indistinguishable w.r.t. continuous A-SAs.
(iii) (u-IND → u-IMP) Let SS be a EUF-CMA signature scheme. For all SA classes A against
SS, and for any u ∈ poly(κ), if SS is u-users indistinguishable w.r.t. continuous A-SAs,
then it is also u-users EUF-CMA w.r.t. continuous A-SAs.
(iv) (1-IMP → u-IMP) For all signature schemes SS and all SA classes A against SS, if SS
is 1-user EUF-CMA w.r.t. continuous A-SAs then, for any u ∈ poly(κ), it is also u-users
EUF-CMA w.r.t. continuous A-SAs.
Proof. (i) Towards contradiction, consider an adversary B that wins the game described in
Deﬁnition 20. We build an adversary B(cid:48) that (using B) wins the game described in Deﬁnition 6.
Let G be the game described in Deﬁnition 20. Consider the game G0, an identical copy of game
G when b = 0, and consider the game G1 an identical copy of game G when b = 1. For an
index (cid:96)∗ ∈ [0, u], consider the hybrid game H(cid:96)∗ where each oracle corresponding to query ((cid:96), j,·)
to queries ((cid:96), j,·) such that (cid:96) > (cid:96)∗ behave as Sign(sk (cid:96),·) (i.e., as in game G1). We note that
H0 ≡ G1 and Hu ≡ G0. We can construct B(cid:48) as follows.
such that (cid:96) ≤ (cid:96)∗ behaves as (cid:101)A(cid:96),j(sk (cid:96),·) (i.e., as in game G0), while all oracles corresponding
Adversary B(cid:48):
1. Sample a random (cid:96)∗ ←$ [u].
2. Receive vk∗ from the challenger and sample (vk (cid:96), sk (cid:96)) ←$ KGen(1κ) for all (cid:96) ∈
[u] \ {(cid:96)∗}. Deﬁne vk (cid:96)∗ = vk∗ and forward (vk 1, . . . , vk u) to adversary B.
3. Whenever B outputs a subversion (cid:101)A(cid:96),j, if (cid:96) = (cid:96)∗ forward it to the challenger.
4. Upon input a query ((cid:96), j, m) from B, behave as follows.
 If (cid:96) ≤ (cid:96)∗ − 1 answer with(cid:101)σ ←$(cid:101)A(cid:96),j(sk (cid:96), m).
 If (cid:96) = (cid:96)∗ forward m to the challenger and send the reply to B.
 If (cid:96) ≥ (cid:96)∗ + 1 answer with σ ←$ Sign(sk (cid:96), m).
5. Output whatever B outputs.
By assumption, we know that B can distinguish between the extreme hybrid games H0 and Hu,
so there must exist an index (cid:96)∗(κ) ∈ [0, u(κ)] such that B can distinguish H(cid:96)∗(κ) and H(cid:96)∗(κ)−1
with a non-negligible advantage. Therefore,
(cid:12)(cid:12)P(cid:2)B(cid:48)(G1) = 1(cid:3) − P(cid:2)B(cid:48)(G0) = 1(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) =

which is a contradiction, ﬁnishing the proof.
(ii) Consider SS to be an EUF-CMA signature scheme with signature size (cid:96) bits, and let
A be the class of SAs for SS that always outputs 0(cid:96) as the signature of any message m ∈ M.
By SS being EUF-CMA, adversary B has only a negligible probability of winning at the game
described in Deﬁnition 7. Consider the adversary B against the game described in Deﬁnition 6.
Adversary B:
37
1. The challenger samples b ←$ {0, 1}, runs (vk , sk ) ←$ KGen(1κ) and forwards vk
to B.
2. B queries the oracle for an arbitrary message m and receives σ as a reply.
3. If σ = 0(cid:96) then output 0, otherwise output 1.
Adversary B clearly has a non-negligible probability of distinguishing the real signing oracle
from the subversion oracle in the game of Deﬁnition 6.
(iii) Let G be the game described in Deﬁnition 21; consider the hybrid game H that behaves
exactly like G, except that queries of type ((cid:96), j), for (cid:96) ∈ [u], are answered using Sign(sk (cid:96),·)
ε(cid:48) : N → [0, 1] such that
instead of(cid:101)A(cid:96),j(sk (cid:96),·). We claim that for all PPT adversaries B, there exists a negligible function
|P [B wins G] − P [B wins H]| ≤ ε(cid:48)(κ).
(6)
In fact, G and H are computationally indistinguishable, as any distinguisher between the two
games directly yields an eﬃcient adversary against the u-users indistinguishability w.r.t. con-
tinuous A-SAs of SS.
On the other hand, note that in game H all queries are answered using the real signing
algorithm. Thus, a straightforward reduction to the EUF-CMA security of SS implies that
there exists a negligible function ε(cid:48)(cid:48) : N → [0, 1] such that, for all PPT adversaries B,
P [B wins H] ≤ ε(cid:48)(cid:48)(κ).
(7)
Putting Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) together, we conclude that for all PPT adversaries B there exists
a negligible function ε : N → [0, 1] such that
P [B wins G] ≤ ε(cid:48)(κ) + ε(cid:48)(cid:48)(κ) ≤ ε(κ),
concluding the proof.
adversary B(cid:48) that (using B) wins the game described in Deﬁnition 7.
(iv) Consider an adversary B that wins the game described in Deﬁnition 21. We build an
Adversary B(cid:48):
1. Receive vk∗ from the challenger, sample (cid:96)∗ ←$ [u] and (vk (cid:96), sk (cid:96)) ←$ KGen(1κ)
for all (cid:96) ∈ [u] \ {(cid:96)∗}. Set vk (cid:96)∗ := vk∗ and forward (vk 1, . . . , vk u) to B.
forward the query to the challenger.
2. Upon each query ((cid:96), m), for (cid:96) ∈ [u]: If (cid:96) (cid:54)= (cid:96)∗ reply with σ ←$ Sign(sk(cid:96), m), else
3. Whenever B outputs a subversion (cid:101)A(cid:96),j, if (cid:96) = (cid:96)∗ forward it to the challenger.
 If (cid:96) (cid:54)= (cid:96)∗, answer with (cid:101)σ ←$(cid:101)A(cid:96),j(sk (cid:96), m), else forward the query to the

5. Eventually B outputs a forgery ((cid:96)(cid:48), m(cid:48), σ(cid:48)); adversary B(cid:48) outputs (m(cid:48), σ(cid:48)) as its
own forgery.
Adversary B(cid:48) is successful if adversary B outputs a valid forgery for user (cid:96)∗. Deﬁne E to be
the event that B(cid:48) guesses correctly the index (cid:96)(cid:48) = (cid:96)∗; note that P [E] = 1/u. Therefore, since
u is a polynomial in the security parameter, adversary B(cid:48) has a non-negligible probability of
winning at the game described in Deﬁnition 7.

7.2 Multi-User Public/Secret Undetectability
In the undetectability deﬁnition for the multi-user setting, user U now receives u ≥ 1 key pairs
from the challenger (only the veriﬁcation keys for public undetectability) and is allowed to make
polynomially many signature queries for all users (key pairs). The answer to these queries are
either computed using the real signature algorithm or a subverted algorithm previously chosen
by the challenger according to an eﬃciently samplable distribution DA that is a parameter in
the deﬁnition. A formal deﬁnition follows.
Deﬁnition 22 (Public/secret undetectability—Multi-user). Let SS = (KGen, Sign, Vrfy) be a
signature scheme, A be some class of SAs for SS, and DA be an eﬃciently samplable distribution
over A. We say that A is u(κ)-users secretly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS if for all PPT users U,

of public/secret undetectability in the presence of SAs, which are depicted in Fig. 6.

(or implications that follow from Theorem 9). For u ≥ 2, public undetectability is represented
by u-pUND and secret undetectability is represented by u-sUND (cf. Deﬁnition 22). Secret
undetectability (cf. Deﬁnition 8) is represented by sUND, whereas public undetectability (cf.
Deﬁnition 8) is equivalent to 1-pUND.
Theorem 9. The following relations hold.
(i) (u-sUND → u-pUND) For any signature scheme SS, all SA classes A against SS and
all eﬃciently samplable distributions DA over A, if A is u-users secretly DA-undetectable
w.r.t. SS, then it is also u-users publicly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS.

(ii) (1-pUND (cid:57) 1-sUND) There exist a signature scheme SS, a SA class A against SS
and an eﬃciently samplable distribution DA over A, such that A is 1-user publicly DA-
undetectable w.r.t. SS but it is not 1-user secretly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS.
(iii) (1-pUND (cid:57) u-pUND) There exist a signature scheme SS, a SA class A against SS
and an eﬃciently samplable distribution DA over A, such that A is 1-user publicly DA-
