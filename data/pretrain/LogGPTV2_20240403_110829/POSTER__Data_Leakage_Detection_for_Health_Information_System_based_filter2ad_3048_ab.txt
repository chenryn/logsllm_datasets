extracted using the standard CNN ResNet-101 with Feature Pyra-
mid Network (FPN) [9][10]. The better representation of objects at
different scales in the medical images are achieved through FPN.
Along with ResNet-101, the use of FPN improved the standard
feature extraction and selection. The steps are as follows:
3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing
All the medical images used for experimentation are explicitly
defined for the research purpose. The collected medical images are
segregated into training and testing, where 80% of medical images
are used to train the model, and 20% of medical images are used
to evaluate the model. A set of sensitive keywords are fed into the
model for annotation. Hence, the sensitive data over the medical
images are then annotated with polygonal bounding boxes. The
annotation tool used in this work is VGG Image Annotator (VIA)2
[7], and the annotations are saved in one JSON file per each folder of
images. The JSON files, along with the resized medical images, are
used to train the model. The sensitive data that are to be identified,
are computed using the covered area by the polygonal points as
per the JSON file.
3.2 Choosing a Model
In the proposed model, we use Mask R-CNN with ResNet-101 cou-
pled by RefineNet and FPN as a backbone. The classify feature of
ResNet-101 is used to classify the images which represent sensitive
data in one class. The FPN combines low-resolution semantically-
strong features with high-resolution. The bottom-up and top-down
pathway connections of FPN allow the features to access the fea-
tures of lower and higher-level at each layer.
3.3 Training
The pre-trained ResNet model is not used for the training, as the in-
put samples and expected output are different. The training process
involves the initialization of some random values to Weight (W)
and bias (b) with an attempt to predict the output with those values.
Initial weight of the model is set to mask_rcnn_coco.h53 from the
Microsoft COCO object detection dataset [11]. Upon comparing the
model’s prediction with the output that it produces, the values in
‘W’ and ‘b’ are adjusted in such a way that it acquires more accurate
prediction. The process is repeated for some epochs. Here the batch
size is set to one since the inference is taken from one image per

“one training step”. The value for the number of epochs is set to 300
with 100 steps each.
4 EVALUATION
The developed prototype system is deployed as a web service using
OpenEMR [12] as a test environment. Users access the medical
management system through a browser and then opens the Elec-
tronic Health Record (EHR) which includes patient information,
including the avatar, medical prescriptions, and external instrument
data (such as X-rays, ultrasound pictures, etc.) [15]. Yet in many
cases, despite warnings from the medical ethical policy committee,
the patient demographics are exposed, and that leads to the leakage
of private health information. In a recent study, it is mentioned that
720 million medical images from laboratory test results of about 24
million patients, were publicly available on the server. In another
two months, with an increase in the exposed server, 1.19 billion
scan images from 35 million patients’ laboratory examinations, ef-
fectuate its unprotected availability on the internet [2][4]. Most of
these records are often stored on servers that lack security precau-
tions. To circumvent the lack of security precaution on the EHR,
we realized the use of system memory introspection by leveraging
lightweight hypervisor. The locations of target memory sections
are recorded in /proc/iomem and marked as “System RAM”as shown
in Figure 3(a). We gather the browser process id and map to extract
its heap of virtual memory area and then dumped all .jpg images
from data extractor as shown in Figure 3(b)&(c). Then all these
extracted medical images are fed to sensitive data identification
model for testing and hence identifying the sensitive data on each
of the medical images as shown in Figure 4.

5 CONCLUSION
Via memory introspection and neural network-based pattern recog-
nition, the proposed system detects the presence of sensitive data
regardless of the type of applications. Unlike traditional DLP sys-
tems that inspect data crossing security perimeter or monitoring
access events on the endpoints, our system looks at the raw data to
be consumed by the application program. This not only circumvents
the use of transport or at-rest encryption but also allows the system

to remain effective for the kind of environments that lack stringent
security perimeters such as the health information systems.
