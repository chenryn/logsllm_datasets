**Title: Improving Mental Models of End-to-End Encrypted Communication**

**Abstract:**

Despite the widespread adoption of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) in popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, iMessage, and Signal, many users still lack a clear and accurate understanding of how E2EE works. This misunderstanding can lead to users opting for less secure communication methods, such as SMS or landline calls, when exchanging sensitive information. Additionally, users may struggle with essential E2EE-related tasks, such as performing authentication ceremonies, which can increase their security and privacy risks.

Our research aims to address this issue by developing and implementing practical educational materials to enhance users' mental models of E2EE. We conducted a series of user studies to inform our approach:

1. **Participatory-Design Tutorial Study (n=25):** 
   - We first conducted a participatory-design tutorial study to identify the most useful and comprehensible information about E2EE for end users.
   
2. **Online Survey Study (n=459):**
   - Based on the insights from the tutorial study, we created short, medium, and long-length educational texts. We then measured the effectiveness of these texts in an online survey.

3. **Longitudinal Study:**
   - Finally, we evaluated the educational messages in a real-world context. We integrated the most effective messages into an open-source messaging app based on Signal and asked participants to use the app for three weeks. The final results of this longitudinal study will be available in early July.

In this talk, we will discuss our design approach and the outcomes of our intervention on users' mental models. We will also share the implications of our findings for the UX design of privacy-preserving communication tools.

**Key Points:**
- **Problem:** Inaccurate user understanding of E2EE leads to security and privacy risks.
- **Approach:** Development and testing of educational materials through user studies.
- **Findings:** Insights from participatory design, online surveys, and a longitudinal study.
- **Impact:** Implications for improving the UX design of secure communication tools.

We believe that our work can significantly contribute to enhancing user awareness and understanding of E2EE, ultimately leading to more secure and private communication practices.
