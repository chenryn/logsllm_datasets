purchase. On the other hand, Figure 2p shows that participants
perceived both values of average time to patch as risky (78%
for 1 month and 91% for 6 months) and also decreasing their
likelihood to purchase (67% for 1 month and 75% for 6 months).
Finally, as we hypothesized, Figure 2h conﬁrms that all levels
of control seem to reduce participants’ perceived risk and
increase their willingness to purchase.
Type of the Device. In addition to the privacy and security
attributes, our results show that the device_type was a
signiﬁcant factor to describe risk perception and willingness to
purchase. In particular, compared to a smart light bulb (baseline
for device_type), participants perceived a signiﬁcantly
higher risk for a smart speaker (estimate = 0.44, p-value
< 0.001) and they were signiﬁcantly less willing to purchase
the smart speaker (estimate = −0.42, p-value < 0.001).
Recipient of the Device. The device_recipient was
not a statistically signiﬁcant factor to describe risk perception.
However, participants’ willingness to purchase the device signif-
icantly decreased when the recipient of the device was a friend
(estimate =−0.13, p-value < 0.05) compared to purchasing the
device for themselves (baseline for device_recipient).
The most common reason participants mentioned for this
decrease was that participants thought friends should decide for
themselves if they want to use the device based on the privacy
and security information. However, in the study conditions
where we asked participants about family members as the
device recipients, they reported feeling more responsible for
purchasing a safe device.
Device Exposure. In each study condition, we asked partici-
pants to specify whether they owned a device of the type in that
condition and how they acquired it (see Appendix B-A). Similar
to prior work [78]–[81], our analysis shows that compared to
not having the device, participants who had the device, either
by purchasing the device themselves (estimate = −0.47, p-
value < 0.001) or acquiring it in other ways (estimate = −0.24,
p-value < 0.05), perceived a signiﬁcantly lower risk. Moreover,
our results indicated that those participants who had the device
had a signiﬁcantly higher (p-value < 0.001) desire to purchase
a future device, compared to those who did not have the device.
Nevertheless, we found no signiﬁcant differences based on how
participants acquired the device.
Prior Scenarios. Our CLMMs show that the number of
prior scenarios inﬂuence the risk perception and willing-
ness to purchase for the current scenario. More speciﬁcally,

prior_scenarios), participants perceived a signiﬁcantly
higher risk for the second scenario (estimate = 0.17, p-value
< 0.05). In the willingness to purchase model, participants
expressed a signiﬁcantly lower desire to purchase the smart
device in the second (estimate = −0.28, p-value < 0.001) as
well as the third scenarios (estimate = −0.46, p-value < 0.001)
compared to the ﬁrst scenario. We found a signiﬁcant difference
in willingness to purchase between the second scenario and
the third scenario (p-value < 0.05). One possible explanation
for this effect could be that participants became more sensitive
to risks as they were exposed to more scenarios and, therefore,
gradually became less willing to purchase the device.
E. Qualitative Results
In most cases, open-ended responses echo and provide
additional insights into our quantitative results. For example,
the open-ended responses help explain why participants were
so concerned about access to their information or devices.
Participants frequently expressed concerns about not knowing
how their information would be used if it was shared with
or sold to third parties. P8 reported: “Once data is sold, you
do not know where or what it is being used for, or if it will
be sold again. This will enable tracking by companies you
are unaware of.” For similar reasons, participants were more
inclined to purchase devices that did not share their data or
store their data in the cloud.
Participants were also concerned about unauthorized access
to devices that lacked access controls. P280 said: “Having no
control means that I have no way of keeping people from
accessing my light bulb and the sensor. There is no password
protection or authentication methods where it would allow only
myself to access the software.”
The open-ended explanations also helped us identify a
number of common reasons for responses that differed from
what we had hypothesized, explained below.
Insufﬁcient Information. Not having enough information
was the most common reason that ﬁve of the factors did not
decrease some participants’ risk perception, despite our hy-
pothesis. In their open-ended responses, participants requested
additional information:
• Average time to patch: 1 month: Out of 122 participants,
68 reported being unsure about whether one month is
too short or too long, expressing that they need more
information on why it takes manufacturers one month to
ﬁx vulnerabilities.
• Security audit: internal & external: Out of 125 participants,
31 wanted to know who the auditors are and what
information they have access to when conducting audits.
• Data linkage: internal & external: Out of 121 participants,
22 wanted to know what these internal and external data
sources are and what the consequences of their data being
linked with such data sources would be.
• Security update: automatic: Out of 128 participants, 21
wanted to know how often their device would get updated
and whether they can control this frequency.
• Device storage: none: Out of 123 participants, 17 wanted
to know whether information would be stored on the cloud
or if no data would be stored at all.
Lack of Trust
in Manufacturers. The second most
common reason that a factor did not impact participants’
risk perception and willingness to purchase was not trusting
manufacturers to follow their stated practices. Some participants
(53/123) expressed a lack of trust when they saw purpose:device
function, for which we provided the explanation “Data is being
collected to provide the main device features, improve services,
and help develop new features.” Although we hypothesized
that providing data for device functionality should decrease
the perceived risk, that was true for only 12% of participants
seeing that information (15/123). Other participants stated that
this information would not impact their risk perception or
would even increase risk, mostly due to their lack of trust
in manufacturers. As P778 explained: “The companies who
collect data are incredibly untrustworthy. They do not have
consumers’ best interests in mind when they are utilizing the
data they collect.”
On the other hand, lack of trust also resulted in most
participants (101/124) expressing concern about purpose:
monetization. P298, who perceived a strongly higher risk,
reported: “This means that the device is collecting all kinds
of information. The device is sharing all kind of information
with companies you do not know if they can be trusted.”
A few participants (11/128) mentioned lack of trust when
assessing the risk of security update: automatic. They reported
that manufacturers can apply unwanted changes to their devices
under the pretext of security updates.
Shared with: none and sold to: none were other attribute-
value pairs where participants expressed lack of trust. Some par-
ticipants mentioned that while they believe this would decrease
potential privacy risks, they do not trust the manufacturers not
to send their data to other companies for proﬁt.
Participants’ comments about trust are consistent with prior
work that has identiﬁed the trust people have in organizations
as one of the factors affecting risk perception [82]–[87].
Following Standard Practices. For eight attribute-value
pairs, participants believed that the reported privacy and security
practices were standard, and, therefore, having them would not
provide additional protection. This reason was most commonly
mentioned about the attribute-value pairs that conveyed to
participants a sense of control over their devices.
These pairs were control over: cloud data deletion (27/122),
control over: device retention (21/125), control over: device
storage (19/128), security audit: internal & external (14/125),
collection frequency: on user demand (12/132), sharing fre-
quency: on user demand (10/127), security update: automatic
(9/128), and access control: multi-factor authentication (5/127).
P878 believed that data collected with user consent is
standard: “I would assume this is standard and normal. If
the company is not ethical, they will just collect the data
anyway.” Moreover, P205 reported that knowing about internal
and external security audits will not change their willingness
to purchase the device by saying: “I’m pretty sure audits are

standard. I assume that any product reaching consumer shelves
has been audited by at least someone.”
Usability Challenges. Some participants reported that re-
quiring users to use multi-factor authentication (37/127) or
consent to data collection each time on user demand (27/132)
would affect device usability. P1334 was particularly concerned
about MFA for shared in-home devices: “Accessing the device
via authentication would then become a hassle and/or annoying.
For instance, what if my wife or a guest wanted to use the
speaker?”
All participants who mentioned usability challenges reported
that the corresponding attribute-value pairs would decrease
the risks. However, they reported that those attribute-value
pairs would have no impact on, and in most cases would even
decrease, their willingness to purchase.
Desire to have Control. Automatic security updates are
widely recommended [63], [64], [77], [88] and, as expected,
security update: automatic signiﬁcantly decreased participants’
risk perception. However, for some participants (19/128), this
decrease in risk perception did not positively impact their
willingness to purchase due to the lack of control implied by
this practice. P535 reported: “I want to have full control over
updating my devices to decrease the risk of installing an update
that has a security ﬂaw.”
No Initial Concerns. In the study conditions where the
device was a smart light bulb, many participants exhibited no
initial concern (those who answered “not at all concerned”).
57% of those participants said they were not aware of any
consequences of the data collection (129/255). Therefore,
privacy and security attribute-values that generally reduced
risk perception had no impact on some participants because
they did not perceive a risk to begin with.
We found a strong correlation between type of device
and the concern level, and as we previously mentioned,
device_type was a signiﬁcant factor in explaining par-
ticipants’ risk perception (see Table II).
Misconceptions. Although we did not ﬁnd any indication of
confusion over the presented attribute-value deﬁnitions, there
were two attribute-value pairs that a few participants appeared
to have misconceptions about, thus affecting their responses.
One pair was security update: none. A few participants (5/125)
mentioned that receiving no security updates implied maximum
security protection, alleviating the need for updates. Another
misunderstood attribute was the average time to patch. Some
participants (8/253 participants across both values of average
time to patch) mentioned that a device that receives security
patches must not be secure or it would not need patches. For
instance, P906 mentioned: “On the label, it advertises that
patches are even needed. That is why there is a perception of
decreased privacy.”
Other Reasons. There were some reasons that were men-
tioned by only a small number of participants. One of the
reasons that an attribute-value pair did not change participants’
willingness to purchase was that they had already decided
either to purchase or not to purchase that kind of device
(68/1371 across all study conditions) due to factors such as
its functionality or their prior privacy and security concerns
with the device. P750, who was asked to imagine purchasing
a smart speaker, reported: “There is little incentive for the
companies to keep data secure. The fact that IoT devices all
send data to a privately controlled server is unacceptable. Any
low-level employee or barely motivated hacker could get access
to all the information. The government could just ask for the
information. I don’t want any such devices in my home.”
Some participants who were in the study conditions, where
they were asked to imagine purchasing the smart device for a
family member or a friend as a gift, mentioned that they did
not feel comfortable making a decision for the gift recipient
without knowing their preferences (49/915 participants across
conditions with friends or family as device_recipient).
Finally, some participants (82/1371 across all study con-
ditions) stated that as long as data is being collected by the
device, no privacy and security practice could eliminate the
potential risks. For instance, P1338 reported: “Just because
I can control how the data is retained on the device doesn’t
mean I have any control about how that data is collected and
how it is used while it is retained - the company could still
upload the data from the device to their server before it is
deleted from the device.”
V. DISCUSSION
Our ﬁndings pave the path to an improved IoT privacy and
security label, which can ultimately lead to a safer and more
secure IoT ecosystem. In this section, we start by providing
recommendations on how to further enhance information
communication and effectiveness of IoT labels. We then provide
a discussion on the impact of risk acceptability on consumers’
willingness to purchase. We continue with a discussion of how
labels may impact consumers’ purchase behavior. Finally, we
provide a brief discussion on the future of IoT labels and
suggest paths toward adoption.
A. Toward a More Effective IoT Label Design
Our quantitative and qualitative results suggest that present-
ing privacy and security attributes in an IoT label is likely
to inﬂuence participants’ risk perception and willingness to
purchase. Although almost all of the tested attribute-value pairs
were statistically signiﬁcant in explaining risk perception and
