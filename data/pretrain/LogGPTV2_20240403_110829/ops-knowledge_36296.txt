User: I want to access a postgreSQL database that's running on a remote machine, from Python in OS/X. Do I have to install postgres on the mac as well? Or will psycopg2 work on its own. 
Any hints for a good installation guide for psycopg2 for os/x?
Assistant: macports tells me that the psycopg2 package has a dependency on the postgres client and libraries (but not the db server). If you successfully installed psycopg, then you should be good to go.
If you haven't installed yet, consider using macports or fink to deal with dependency resolution for you. In most cases, this will make things easier (occasionally build problems erupt).
