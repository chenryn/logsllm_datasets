We have made several changes to the window.open functionality to use the
native blink/chromium code, but we are always working with embedded views so
I'm looking for a little help to upstream this without breaking other use
cases  
Starting from brave/muon@`6ee28c3` to brave/muon@`9dc98b1`  
We are working on getting the remaining electron tests passing and I'm happy
to create a pull request as the basis for this, but some help/feedback would
be welcome. Thanks!
