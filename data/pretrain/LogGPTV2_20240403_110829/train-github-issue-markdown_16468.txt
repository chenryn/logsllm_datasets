We have implemented several changes to the `window.open` functionality to utilize the native Blink/Chromium code. However, our work primarily involves embedded views, and we need some guidance to ensure that these changes can be upstreamed without disrupting other use cases.

The changes are detailed in the commits from brave/muon@`6ee28c3` to brave/muon@`9dc98b1`.

Currently, we are working on getting the remaining Electron tests to pass. I am prepared to create a pull request as a starting point for this effort, and any feedback or assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
