User: Is there a source tarball of Twisted available for download which could be used to build it in Fedora or CentOS? I see the download for Ubuntu/Debian on the site, of course.
Assistant: You can use python pip to install twisted in centos or fedora.
Make sure you have python-pip installed then just do sudo pip install twisted in terminal
