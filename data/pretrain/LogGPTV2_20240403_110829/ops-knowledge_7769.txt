Is there a source tarball of Twisted available for download that can be used to build it on Fedora or CentOS? I noticed that the site provides downloads for Ubuntu/Debian, but I'm looking for options specific to my distribution.

**Response:**

While the official Twisted website primarily provides pre-built packages for Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, you can still obtain and build Twisted from the source tarball for use on Fedora or CentOS. 

Here are the steps to do so:

1. **Download the Source Tarball:**
   - Visit the [Twisted download page](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads) and locate the latest source tarball (e.g., `Twisted-20.3.0.tar.gz`).

2. **Install Required Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. For Fedora and CentOS, you can install them using:
     ```sh
     sudo dnf install python3-devel python3-pip
     ```

3. **Extract and Build Twisted:**
   - Extract the downloaded tarball:
     ```sh
     tar -xzf Twisted-20.3.0.tar.gz
     cd Twisted-20.3.0
     ```
   - Build and install Twisted:
     ```sh
     sudo python3 setup.py install
     ```

Alternatively, if you prefer a simpler method, you can use `pip` to install Twisted directly. Make sure you have `python3-pip` installed, and then run:
```sh
sudo pip3 install twisted
```

This will automatically handle the installation and any required dependencies.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully build and install Twisted on your Fedora or CentOS system.
