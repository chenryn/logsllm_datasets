User: How to implement the function of querying keywords in the database through SQL statements?
Assistant: The function of querying keywords in the database can be realized by using the LIKE operator in SQL. The LIKE operator is used for fuzzy matching and can perform wildcard matching. For example, the following SQL statement can query employees whose names contain "Zhang": SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name LIKE '%张%'; Among them, % represents a wildcard, which means to match any number of any characters. If you want to query the names starting with "Zhang", you can use the following SQL statement: SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name LIKE 'Zhang%'; Similarly, if you want to query the names ending with "Zhang", you can use the following SQL statement: SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name LIKE '%Zhang'; In addition, multiple keywords can be combined for fuzzy matching. For example, the following SQL statement can query employees whose names contain "Zhang" and "San": SELECT * FROM employee WHERE name LIKE '%Zhang%' AND name LIKE '%三%';
