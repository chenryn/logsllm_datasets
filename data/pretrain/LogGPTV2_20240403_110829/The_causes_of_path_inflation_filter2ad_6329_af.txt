# Path Inflation in the Internet: Impact of Topology and Policy

## 6.1 Impact of AS-Graph on Path Inflation

In this subsection, we measure the path inflation caused by the lowest-latency, intra-domain, and peering policy-compliant paths between Points of Presence (POPs) in different ISPs. In subsequent subsections, we will constrain inter-domain path selection using common policies that do not minimize latency.

If the AS-level topology of the Internet were sparse, we would expect that paths might traverse several ISPs to reach their destination, potentially contributing significant path inflation. However, AS-paths through the Internet are generally short [16], and the subset of the network we study consists of tier-1 and well-connected tier-2 ISPs. As a result, we expect inter-domain topology to contribute only modest path inflation.

**Figure 15** shows the path inflation experienced along the lowest-latency AS path between any two POPs in the network. This represents the inflation when each ISP chooses the best (in terms of latency) next-hop AS without changing intra-domain routing or peering policy. On the same graph, we also plot the inflation between POPs in adjacent ISPs from Section 5.3. Although different samples of POP pairs are used for the two lines, and so should not be compared directly, crossing multiple ISPs does not appear to contribute significant additional path inflation.

## 6.2 Impact of Inter-domain Routing Policy on Path Inflation

We now consider how well inter-domain routing policies choose paths using this topology. There are two fundamental policies used by ISPs that represent common business arrangements [12, 13]:

1. **No-valley Peers**: Peers and customers generally do not provide transit (carry traffic to other peers). Without paying customers, there is no incentive for an ISP to carry traffic.
2. **Prefer-customer Paths**: Paths through customers are preferred to those through peers, which are in turn preferred to those via providers. Paths through customers generally represent income; through providers, an expense; and through peers, no (or little) cost.

These rules have the potential to create path inflation because they prohibit the use of certain paths that exist in the topology. We inferred the (provider-customer and peer-peer) relationships between ISPs using Gao’s analysis [12]. We then simulated these policies in path selection over the topology; each ISP chooses and propagates legal no-valley paths, using the prefer-customer rule before breaking ties by shortest AS path, then lowest intra-domain cost. Among paths that conform to no-valley and prefer-customer policies, paths that traverse the fewest ISPs (shortest AS-path length) are usually chosen. 

**Figure 16** shows the inflation caused by prefer-customer and no-valley policies, relative to the lowest-latency path characterized in Figure 15. Each of the series is quite similar because most of the inflation is caused simply by choosing the shortest AS path. The no-valley line on the CDF shows slightly less inflation—this rule prevents some bad paths—while adding prefer-customer chooses slightly more inflated paths. These differences do not appear to be significant; the graph primarily shows the inflation that results from shortest AS path routing. These results are consistent with the findings of Tangmunarunkit et al. [32], who evaluate these policies based on router hop counts. At right, we show that it is the long paths that are made longer. Unlike intra-domain paths shown in Figure 5, shortest AS paths do not minimize latency.

In summary, we find that inter-domain routing in the current Internet has a significant impact on path inflation, with more than half of the paths being longer than the shortest path. However, policies such as no-valley and prefer-customer arising out of commercial concerns are not a major contributing factor. Instead, most of the inflation comes from using the shortest AS-path as the distance metric.

## 7. Summary

**Figure 17** shows the cumulative impact of all six factors on path inflation, computed with reference to a direct hypothetical link between the source and the destination. The inflation caused by a particular factor alone can be isolated by subtracting its inflation from the previous factor. The two biggest factors are inter-domain and peering policy. Interestingly, the median inflation caused by inter-domain policy (6.9–3.0 = 3.9 ms) is much more than the median inflation caused by intra-domain topology, which represents physical link constraints.

We argue that the observed inflation in paths due to peering and inter-domain policies is not the result of desired routing patterns but signifies a lack of good tools for ISPs to find better paths. Our results in Section 4.3 suggest that ISPs optimize their own paths for latency, as long as it does not cause congestion. In Section 5.2, we demonstrated widespread cooperation among ISPs to engineer better paths. Combining these results, we argue that given the right set of tools, ISPs would use them to reduce both congestion and path inflation.

At both the peering and inter-domain levels, there is an absence of mechanisms in BGP to enable better path selection. For the former, there is no convenient way to do optimal exit routing or topology-sensitive load-balancing across peering links. BGP MEDs are designed to assist in the selection of peering links; downstream ISPs propagate their preference for which link to use to the upstream ISP. The upstream ISP, however, has no semantically meaningful way to combine these preferences with their internal shortest-path lengths. One must either ignore MEDs (early-exit) or listen to them (late-exit).

Similarly, BGP does not propagate enough information to enable informed AS path selection, and as a result, ISPs often use minimum AS-hop count paths. We showed in Section 6.2 that paths with minimum AS-hop count are often longer than needed. In practice, operators try to tune performance when the defaults are unacceptably bad. Even then, this involves cumbersome manual configuration, which is error-prone [19] and may be sub-optimal, as in the case of AT&T’s San Francisco peering with Sprint.

We believe path selection can be significantly improved if effective mechanisms to achieve these goals were added to BGP. One possible mechanism would append geographic coordinates to route advertisements. These coordinates would denote where a route enters and exits each ISP in the path without publishing details of the topology of an ISP. Our measurements indicate that geography is a good indicator of latency for paths that lie within most ISPs. The upstream ISP could then choose AS paths and peering links to minimize latency and use location-sensitive load balancing for congested peering links.

## 8. Related Work

Our work draws on and benefits from three separate lines of research: topology collection and analysis, policy inference, and studies of the impact of routing policies.

Various researchers have collected and analyzed Internet topology at different granularities, such as router-level [15, 7, 27] and AS-level [9, 6]. We use the techniques of router-level topology collection (traceroute) and router name-to-location mapping [27, 22] to collect POP-level topologies of 65 major ISPs and their interconnections. Extending previous work that studied topology properties, such as degree distribution [9, 35, 5] and resilience [35], we study how topology impacts path inflation.

Inference of routing policy to date has been limited to the inter-domain case [12, 29]. We add two key missing pieces to routing policy inference work: inference of intra-domain traffic engineering and inference of peering policy between a pair of ISPs.

Starting with the Detour project [26], much attention has been given to the impact of inter-domain routing policies on performance. Detour showed that there exist paths in the Internet that are better than those being used. While it measured the end-to-end impact of routing policies, we infer the topology and routing policies at various levels and use those results to isolate the effect of each level of routing on end-to-end performance.

Subramanian et al. [30] use geographic distances to study the "circuitousness" of network paths using a dataset of fifteen sources and six thousand destinations. Through analysis of the relative distance traveled in the upstream versus the downstream ISP, they hint at the prevalence of early-exit peering policy. We use a much larger data set and topology inference to expose the diversity and impact of peering policies.

The impact of inter-domain path selection has been studied in some detail. Tangmunarunkit et al. [33] studied inter-domain path selection and observed that paths are frequently chosen based on criteria other than the shortest AS path. Two studies then followed to attribute this AS-level path inflation to the no-valley and prefer-customer BGP policies. While Wang and Gao found significant inflation of AS-paths due to these policies [13], Tangmunarunkit et al. found router hop lengths did not increase significantly as a result [32]. Our study extends this work to show that path latency does not increase significantly due to no-valley and prefer-customer policies.

## 9. Conclusions

In this paper, we analyzed how topology and policy combine to contribute to path inflation at three levels in the Internet: intra-domain, peering, and inter-domain. While longer paths are not always harmful, they are often symptomatic of traffic engineering practices in the Internet.

Through a trace-driven analysis, we isolated the effects of the six causes of path inflation: topology and policy at all three levels. We collected city-level maps of 65 ISPs and their interconnections using traces from 42 vantage points to all globally-routed IP address prefixes. We also devised novel techniques to infer the intra-domain routing policy and the peering policy among pairs of ISPs. We used these models to evaluate observed and alternative routing policies in terms of path inflation.

We found that setting weights on intra-domain links does not significantly impact path inflation, suggesting that intra-domain traffic engineering is latency-sensitive. Our analysis exposed diverse peering policies, from late-exit to micro-engineered to load-balanced, and we provided the first empirical data on the prevalence of these policies. Although early-exit is used by most ISPs most of the time, most engineer at least some paths to accomplish policy goals. Unlike intra-domain policies, current peering policies do impact path inflation, with over 30% of the paths being longer than the shortest available path. We also found that inter-domain routing causes significant path inflation, with almost half the paths being inflated, not because of policies arising out of commercial concerns, but because the shortest AS path is the default.

The latency sensitivity of intra-domain routing and the cooperation among ISPs to engineer better peering exits suggests that ISPs are willing to work together to achieve low latency routing. In view of this, we believe that Internet path inflation can be significantly reduced if effective mechanisms were made available to ISPs to engineer better peering point and AS-path selection.
