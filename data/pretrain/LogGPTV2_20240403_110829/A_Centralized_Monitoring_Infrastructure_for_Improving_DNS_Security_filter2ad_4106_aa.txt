### Executive Summary

To evaluate the potential impact of DNSSEC on broadband consumers, we tested 24 residential Internet router and Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) firewall devices commonly used with broadband services. Our key findings are as follows:

- **All 24 units** could route DNSSEC queries to upstream resolvers without size limitations.
- **22 units** could proxy DNS queries addressed directly to them, with varying degrees of success.
- **6 of the 22 DNS proxies** had difficulty with DNSSEC-related flags and/or validated responses, effectively preventing DNSSEC use in proxy mode.
- **16 of the 22 DNS proxies** could successfully pass DNSSEC queries and return validated responses of some size.
- **18 DNS proxies** limited responses over UDP to either 512 bytes or a size constrained by the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU). Only 4 units could return responses up to 4096 bytes over UDP, and just 1 unit could proxy DNS over TCP (no size limit).
- When deployed with factory defaults, **15 units** are likely to be used as DNS proxies, while **3 units** always route DNS queries. The remaining **6 units** vary over time, preferring to route DNS after being connected to a WAN.
- Consequently, only **6 units (25%)** operate with full DNSSEC compatibility out of the box. **9 units (37%)** can be reconfigured to bypass DNS proxy incompatibilities. Unfortunately, the rest (38%) lack reconfigurable DHCP DNS parameters, making it harder for LAN clients to bypass their interference with DNSSEC use.

These findings, their potential impact on DNSSEC use by broadband consumers, and implications for router/firewall manufacturers are presented and analyzed in this report.

### 1. Introduction

In July and August 2008, Core Competence and Nominet collaborated to develop and conduct a series of tests to assess the impact of DNSSEC on residential Internet router and SOHO firewall devices commonly used with broadband services. This report documents our findings.

#### 1.1 Objective

The objective was to assess the support (or interference) of router/firewall devices for DNS queries pertaining to DNSSEC-signed domains, as well as DNSSEC queries on unsigned domains. We conducted lab tests to determine whether each unit correctly routes and/or proxies:
- DNS queries requiring TCP or EDNS0 to convey lengthy DNSSEC responses.
- Non-DNSSEC queries on signed and unsigned domains.
- Non-DNSSEC queries that set other DNSSEC-related request flags.
- DNSSEC queries that request server-side validation.
- DNSSEC queries that request no server-side validation.

#### 1.2 Background

Our tests were based on those originally developed by .SE and documented in "DNSSEC Tests of Consumer Broadband Routers" (February 2008, [http://iis.se/docs/Routertester_en.pdf](http://iis.se/docs/Routertester_en.pdf)). We refined these tests to decouple related features, examine DNSSEC handling more rigorously, increase test repeatability, and improve result reliability. The tests were executed in closed, controlled test beds to enable repeated, deterministic execution. Nominet tested units with xDSL WAN ports, while Core Competence tested units with 10/100 Ethernet WAN ports. We aimed to test the most commonly used broadband router/firewalls in the US and UK, using market research, broadband provider websites, and retail "best seller" lists.

### 2. Test Methodology

All DNS queries were executed twice: first, to an upstream DNSSEC-aware recursive resolver to verify transparent routing, and second, directly to the unit under test to exercise the DNS proxy. These usage styles are referred to as "route mode" and "proxy mode," respectively.

#### 2.1 Test Cases

1. **TCP/IP Compatibility**: Can the unit route or proxy DNS queries to a DNSSEC-aware resolver over TCP?
   - DNSSEC responses may exceed 512 bytes, necessitating TCP. If both TCP and EDNS0 are unsupported, DNS queries on signed domains may fail. We determined TCP and UDP support at the start and conducted all DNSSEC tests over UDP with responses shorter than 512 bytes.

2. **EDNS0 Compatibility**: Can the unit route or proxy DNS queries to a DNSSEC-aware resolver over UDP using EDNS0?
   - For units that do not proxy DNS queries over TCP, EDNS0 is required to handle lengthy DNSSEC responses. We queried four unsigned domains over UDP with five different EDNS0 buffer sizes (512, 1024, 1536, 2048, 4096 bytes) to assess support.

3. **DNSSEC-Signed Domain Compatibility**: Can the unit route or proxy non-DNSSEC queries on signed domains to a DNSSEC-aware resolver?
   - This baseline test isolated unrelated failures, such as inability to reach the upstream resolver or basic NAT problems.

4. **DNSSEC Request Flag Compatibility**: Can the unit route or proxy non-DNSSEC queries that set Authentic Data (AD) and/or Checking Disabled (CD) flags?
   - We queried signed and unsigned domains to ensure setting the AD flag and/or CD flag did not adversely impact the unit. See Appendix B for tested AD/CD flag permutations and expected responses.

5. **DNSSEC OK (DO) Compatibility**: Can the unit route or proxy DNSSEC queries that request server-side validation by setting the DNSSEC OK (DO) flag?
   - We verified that server-validated DNSSEC responses were correctly returned to the client, without modification, and with the correct flags set.

6. **Checking Disabled (CD) Compatibility**: Can the unit route or proxy DNSSEC queries that disable server validation by setting both DO and CD flags?
   - We ensured that non-validated DNSSEC responses were correctly returned to the client, without modification, and with the expected flags set.

7. **Other DNS Security Tests**:
   - **No Open Resolver**: Does the unit ignore or reject DNS queries originating from the Internet?
   - **Source Port Randomization**: Does the unit preserve inside DNS resolver source port randomization?
   - **0x20 Bit Support**: Does the unit preserve case distinctions in domain names?

#### 2.2 Test Beds

Nominet and Core Competence test beds each contained DNS clients (BIND 9.5.0-P1 dig, Net::DNS 0.63, NET::DNS::SEC 0.14) and a pair of local DNSSEC-aware resolvers (two instances of BIND 9.5.0-P1 named, running on a single server). DNS clients and servers were connected to the router/firewall under test by 10/100 Ethernet or a DSLAM.

### 3. Test Results

Query responses were recorded at the DNS client, and sniffers captured DNS packets on both sides of the unit under test. Responses were compared to reference responses and defined success/failure criteria to determine the test outcome.

### 4. Conclusions

#### 4.1 Consumer Impacts and Mitigation Strategies

When LAN DHCP defaults are used to supply DNS server addresses to clients, most broadband router/firewalls identify themselves as the local DNS, while others supply the ISP's DNS address. In this report, a unit that defaults to its own address is said to prefer DNS proxy mode, while a unit that defaults to an upstream resolver's address is said to prefer DNS route mode.

To avoid ambiguity or error, all DNS test queries were explicitly addressed to the router/firewall or upstream resolver. However, we also recorded LAN DHCP defaults (summarized in Table 2, see Appendix A for details) because they reflect how most broadband consumers use tested products, and therefore the potential impact of any DNSSEC issues.

#### 4.2 Recommendations for Manufacturers

- **Improve DNS Proxy Support**: Enhance DNS proxy capabilities to fully support DNSSEC, including larger response sizes and proper handling of DNSSEC-related flags.
- **Enable Reconfiguration**: Provide options for users to reconfigure DHCP DNS parameters to bypass DNS proxy incompatibilities.
- **Enhance Security Features**: Ensure that routers and firewalls do not act as open resolvers and preserve source port randomization to enhance security.
