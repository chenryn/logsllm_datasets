Executive Summary 
To assess potential impact of DNSSEC on broadband consumers, we tested two dozen 
residential Internet router and SOHO firewall devices commonly used with broadband 
services. In summary, we found that: 
•  All 24 units could route DNSSEC queries addressed to upstream resolvers 
(referred to herein as route mode) without size limitations. 
•  22 units could proxy DNS queries addressed directly to them (referred to herein 
as proxy mode), with varying degrees of success. 
•  6 of 22 DNS proxies had difficulty with DNSSEC-related flags and/or validated 
responses that effectively prevented DNSSEC use in proxy mode. 
•  16 of 22 DNS proxies could successfully pass DNSSEC queries and return 
validated responses of some size. 
•  18 DNS proxies limited responses over UDP to either 512 bytes or a size 
constrained by the MTU.  Only 4 could return responses over UDP up to 4096 
bytes, while just 1 could proxy DNS over TCP (no size limit). Such limits can 
interfere with returning longer DNSSEC responses. 
•  When deployed with factory defaults, 15 units are likely to be used as DNS 
proxies, while 3 always route DNS queries. The rest (6) vary over time, preferring 
to route DNS after being connected to a WAN. 
As a consequence, we conclude that just 6 units (25%) operate 
with full DNSSEC compatibility "out of the box."  9 units (37%) 
can be reconfigured to bypass DNS proxy incompatibilities.  
Unfortunately, the rest (38%) lack reconfigurable DHCP DNS 
parameters, making it harder for LAN clients to bypass their 
interference with DNSSEC use. 
These findings, their potential impact on DNSSEC use by broadband consumers, and 
implications for router/firewall manufacturers, are presented and analyzed in this report.

1. Introduction 
During July and August 2008, Core Competence and Nominet collaborated to develop 
and conduct a series of tests, intended to assess the impact of DNSSEC on residential 
Internet router and SOHO firewall devices commonly used with broadband services.  
This report documents our findings. 
1.1 Objective 
To assess router/firewall support for (or interference with) DNS queries pertaining to 
DNSSEC-signed domains, as well as DNSSEC queries on unsigned domains, we 
conducted lab tests to determine whether each unit correctly routes and/or proxies: 
•  DNS queries requiring TCP or EDNS0 to convey lengthy DNSSEC responses 
•  Non-DNSSEC queries on signed and unsigned domains 
•  Non-DNSSEC queries that set other DNSSEC-related request flags 
•  DNSSEC queries that request server-side validation 
•  DNSSEC queries that request no server-side validation 
1.2 Background 
We started with tests originally developed by .SE and documented in "DNSSEC Tests of 
Consumer Broadband Routers" (February 2008, http://iis.se/docs/Routertester_en.pdf).  
Based on lessons learned from earlier efforts, we refined our tests to decouple testing of 
related features, examine DNSSEC handling more rigorously, increase test repeatability, 
and improve result reliability. 
The tests described in this report were executed in closed, controlled test beds to enable 
repeated, deterministic execution.  Nominet tested units with xDSL WAN ports, while 
Core Competence tested units with 10/100 Ethernet WAN ports.  Between us, we set out 
to test the broadband router/firewalls most commonly used today in the US and UK.  To 
maximize coverage, we used published market research, broadband provider websites, 
and retail "best seller" lists to identify the most widely-deployed: 
•  Residential Internet routers supplied by broadband providers 
•  Residential Internet routers purchased by consumers 
•  Entry-level firewall appliances purchased by Small/Home Offices (SOHOs) 
To minimize duplication, we generally avoided Ethernet and xDSL variations of the same 
product, retesting products previously tested by .SE, or testing more than two products 
from the same family.

2. Test Methodology 
All DNS queries were executed twice.  In the first pass queries were addressed to an 
upstream DNSSEC-aware recursive resolver to verify that DNS packets could be routed 
transparently.  For the second pass queries were addressed directly to the unit under 
test to exercise router/firewall DNS proxies. These DNS usage styles are referred to 
throughout this report as route mode and proxy mode, respectively. 
Nearly all upstream tests were successful; most of our findings pertain to problems with 
DNS proxy handling of DNSSEC queries and the lengthy responses they can generate. 
To determine where and how these problems occur, we examined the following cases. 
2.1 Test Cases 
T) TCP/IP Compatibility: Can the unit route or proxy DNS queries to a DNSSEC-aware 
resolver over TCP? 
DNSSEC responses may not fit into one 512-byte UDP packet.  When UDP 
queries fail, clients may revert automatically to TCP.  Where both TCP and 
EDNS0 are not supported, DNS queries on signed domains may fail. To avoid 
orthogonal fail-overs during later tests, we determined TCP and UDP support at 
test start. We then conducted all DNSSEC tests over UDP, with responses 
shorter than 512 bytes. 
A) EDNS0 Compatibility: Can the unit route or proxy DNS queries to a DNSSEC-aware 
resolver over UDP using EDNS0? 
For units that do not proxy DNS queries over TCP, EDNS0 is required to handle 
lengthy DNSSEC responses.  To assess EDNS0 support, we queried four 
unsigned domains over UDP, using five different EDNS0 buffer sizes (512, 1024, 
1536, 2048, 4096 bytes).  Queried domains return TXT records of increasing (but 
consistent and predictable) lengths, designed to fit in certain buffer sizes and be 
truncated at others.  Results indicate whether the router/firewall can return 
lengthy responses using EDNS0 and limits imposed on UDP response size.  For 
test independence, we did not permit truncated UDP tests to fail-over to TCP. 
B) DNSSEC-Signed Domain Compatibility: Can the unit route or proxy non-DNSSEC 
queries on signed domains to a DNSSEC-aware resolver? 
We ran this baseline before all other DNSSEC flag tests to isolate and eliminate 
unrelated failures causes (e.g., inability to reach upstream resolver, responses 
larger than 512 bytes, basic NAT problems).  Units that cannot successfully 
handle these non-DNSSEC queries are unlikely to handle any other query with 
DNSSEC flags set. 
E) DNSSEC Request Flag Compatibility: Can the unit route or proxy non-DNSSEC 
queries that set Authentic Data (AD) and/or Checking Disabled (CD) flags? 
We then queried signed and unsigned domains to ensure that setting the AD flag 
and/or the CD flag in a non-DNSSEC query did not adversely impact tested units.

Version 1.0 
Page 4 
Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls 
These flags are carried in queries but are currently only meaningful in 
conjunction with the DNSSEC OK flag. We tested all possible AD/CD request 
flag permutations to isolate any underlying flag-handling bugs before making 
DNSSEC OK queries.  See Appendix B for tested AD/CD flag permutations and 
expected responses. 
C) DNSSEC OK (DO) Compatibility: Can the unit route or proxy DNSSEC queries that 
request server-side validation by setting the DNSSEC OK (DO) flag? 
We queried signed and unsigned domains to verify that server-validated 
DNSSEC responses were correctly returned to the client, without modification, 
and flags set correctly. 
•  Signed domain queries with DO=1 should return a complete DNSSEC 
response with AD=1, indicating that the response contains authenticated 
data. 
•  Unsigned domain queries with DO=1 should return a plain DNS response 
with AD=0, indicating that authenticated data was not available. 
To pass this test, the router/firewall must pass the client's DO request flags to the 
security-aware server and do nothing to modify that server's response. Test zone 
TTLs were set to zero to prevent the resolver and/or proxy from returning 
previously-validated cached responses. 
D) Checking Disabled (CD) Compatibility:  Can the unit route or proxy DNSSEC 
queries that disable server validation by setting both DO and CD flags? 
We queried signed and unsigned domains with Checking Disabled (CD=1) to 
ensure that non-validated DNSSEC responses were correctly returned to the 
client, without modification and with the expected flags set. 
•  Signed domain queries with both DO=1 and CD=1 should return a complete 
DNSSEC response with CD=1 and AD=0, indicating that validation was 
neither requested nor performed. 
•  Unsigned domain queries with both DO=1 and CD=1 should return a plain 
DNS response with CD=1 and AD=0, indicating that validation was neither 
requested nor performed. 
Here again, to pass this test, the router/firewall must pass the client's CD request 
to the security-aware server and do nothing to modify that server's response. 
F) Other DNS Security Tests:  In addition to transport and DNSSEC flag tests, we took 
this opportunity to look for the following DNS router/firewall security issues: 
No Open Resolver: Does the router/firewall ignore or explicitly reject DNS 
queries that originate from the Internet, sent to the unit's WAN port?

Version 1.0

Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls 
Source Port Randomization: Does the router/firewall NAT preserve inside DNS 
resolver source port randomization (e.g., to mitigate packet spoofing)? 
0x20 Bit Support: Does the router/firewall preserve case distinctions in the 
domain names carried by DNS queries (e.g., to deter response forgery)? 
All test commands, expected "success" responses, and common failure conditions are 
described in Appendix B.  Test results are analyzed in Section 3. 
2.2 Test Beds 
Nominet and Core Competence test beds each contained DNS clients (BIND 9.5.0-P1 
dig, Net::DNS 0.63, NET::DNS::SEC 0.14) and a pair of local DNSSEC-aware resolvers 
(two instances of BIND 9.5.0-P1 named, running on a single server). DNS clients and 
servers were connected to the router/firewall under test by 10/100 Ethernet or a DSLAM.

Figure 1. Test Environment 
Earlier experiments showed that Internet-based tests could fail due to intermittent delays 
and outages.  Repeatability was also affected by remote caching, software upgrades, 
and zone data updates.  To avoid those problems, we created closed test beds; all 
systems consulted during our test runs were local. 
Local authoritative resolvers in both test beds were populated with signed and unsigned 
records.  Zone content and record lengths were chosen to avoid triggering EDNS0 and 
TCP failures during DNSSEC tests and exercise EDNS0 buffer sizes. 
Each unit was tested in near-factory-default condition, with the minimum necessary 
changes required to set up the test scenario (e.g., enabling DHCP, setting the WAN 
DNS to the local recursive resolver).  This is how most residential broadband 
subscribers actually deploy these routers and firewalls, and lets us assess the likely 
impact of DNSSEC on those consumers.  Each unit was tested with the factory-shipped 
firmware.  However, we also noted where firmware updates were available and retested 
all of those units at project end, finding just one difference that impacted test outcomes.

3. Test Results 
Query responses were recorded at the DNS client and sniffers were used to capture 
DNS packets on both sides of the unit under test. Responses were compared to 
reference responses and defined success/failure criteria to determine test outcome.

3.2 Result Analysis 
We offer the following observations about the test outcomes shown in Table 2: 
•  All 24 units could route DNSSEC queries transparently to upstream resolvers 
without flag or length limitations. 
•  All 22 units with DNS proxies could handle non-DNSSEC queries about signed 
domains. 
•  6 of 22 DNS proxies had difficulty with DNSSEC-related flags and/or validated 
responses that effectively prevented DNSSEC use in proxy mode. 
•  16 of 22 DNS proxies could successfully pass DNSSEC queries and return validated 
responses of some length. 
•  18 proxies limited DNS response size over UDP to either 512 bytes, or a total packet 
size constrained by the MTU. 
•  4 proxies could return UDP/EDNS0 responses up to 4096 bytes. 
•  Just one unit could proxy DNS over TCP. 
•  When deployed with factory defaults, 15 units are likely to be used as DNS proxies, 
while 3 always route DNS queries. The rest (6) vary over time, routing DNS to an 
upstream resolver only after being connected to a WAN. 
o  6 units operate with full DNSSEC compatibility "out of the box."   
o  9 units can be reconfigured to bypass their DNS proxy incompatibilities. 
o  9 units lack reconfigurable DHCP DNS parameters, making it harder for LAN 
clients to bypass their DNSSEC incompatibilities. 
•  All units faithfully copied 0x20 bits; two were open resolvers. 
•  Half of these units did not preserve source port randomization. 
These observations and their impact on DNSSEC usage are analyzed below. 
"Out of the Box" DNS Usage 
When LAN DHCP defaults are used to supply DNS server addresses to clients, most 
broadband router/firewalls identify themselves as the local DNS, while others supply the 
ISP's DNS address (usually inherited from WAN link settings).  In this report, a unit that 
defaults to its own address is said to prefer DNS proxy mode, while a unit that defaults to 
an upstream resolver's address is said to prefer DNS route mode. 
To avoid ambiguity or error, all DNS test queries were explicitly addressed to the 
router/firewall or upstream resolver. However, we also recorded LAN DHCP defaults 
(summarized in Table 2, see Appendix A for details) because they reflect how most 
broadband consumers use tested products, and therefore the potential impact of any 
DNSSEC issues.

 Table 3. "Out of the Box" Usage Summary 
We found that 3 products were likely to be used in route mode because they do not 
proxy at all or require explicit configuration to enable the DNS proxy. 
Another 6 products preferred route mode, but are likely to be used in proxy mode at 
least part-time because LAN DHCP DNS settings vary based on WAN state: 
•  One unit defaulted to proxy mode on first install. It then stored the ISP's DNS 
address in NVRAM for all future use, independent of WAN state. 
•  Five units defaulted to proxy mode at boot, subsequently delivering the ISP's 
DNS address in all DHCP leases obtained once the WAN was up. Clients are 
thus likely to use these DNS proxies after each reboot, until their initial lease 
expires (roughly 1 to 2 days). 
The remaining 15 units preferred DNS proxy mode. In fact, 9 of these units could not be 
reconfigured to disable the proxy or deliver upstream resolver addresses to LAN DHCP 
clients. See section 4.1 for consumer impacts and DNSSEC compatibility conclusions.

Test Report: DNSSEC Impact on Broadband Routers and Firewalls 
Route DNS to Upstream Resolver 
When LAN clients send DNS queries directly to the ISP's DNS, the router/firewall should 
route them transparently to that upstream resolver.  Packets are firewalled and NAT'ed, 
but DNS client/server interaction (including DNSSEC) should not be impeded. 
One unit repeatedly experienced a possible memory leak when routing our longest 
response, while another intercepted and proxied queries addressed to upstream 
resolvers (fixed in newer firmware).  These exceptions demonstrate that transparent 
routing should not be taken for granted.  But as a rule, we found that router/firewalls can 
generally route DNSSEC queries to upstream resolvers transparently, without adverse 
impact. 
The rest of our findings pertain to router/firewall DNS proxy operation – the usage mode 
experienced by most residential broadband consumers. 
Proxy DNS over TCP 
Until the introduction of EDNS0 (see below) the only way to receive a DNS response 
exceeding 512 bytes was to use TCP instead of UDP. 
Typically a DNS client would issue its initial request with UDP.  If the response was too 
large the server would send back a UDP response with the TC (“Truncation”) bit set.  
The client would then automatically fallback to using TCP. 
Additionally, certain DNS operations (particularly Zone Transfers – “AXFR”) are only 
intended to operate over TCP. 
Disappointingly, we found that support for TCP in broadband router/firewall DNS proxies 
is almost non-existent.  Virtually all DNS responses are therefore proxied over UDP, and 
all of our DNSSEC tests were conducted over UDP only, reflecting the way that most 
broadband consumers would experience DNSSEC. 
Proxy DNS over UDP - EDNS0 Compatibility 
EDNS0 (RFC 2671) is a method by which DNS clients can indicate to servers that they 
are able to receive UDP packets that are larger than the original RFC1035 maximum of 
512 bytes. 
This capability is indicated by including an Options (OPT) Resource Record (RR) in the 
Additional Section of the DNS query.  Using EDNS0, clients may specify their maximum 
receive buffer size for DNS responses.  To pass this test, proxies must process the 
client's query and: 
•  Return valid responses that fit in the specified buffer without truncation, or 
• 
Indicate truncation for responses that would exceed the specified buffer. 
For example, tests that generate 400 or 800 byte responses whilst specifying a buffer 
size of 1024 bytes should return those records without error or truncation, while tests 
that would otherwise generate 1600 or 3200 byte responses should return truncated 
responses with TC=1 at that buffer size.

Although nearly every proxy we tested supported UDP queries, most had some degree 
of difficulty supporting EDNS0 (summarized in the following graphs, explained below, 
see Appendix A for further detail).

Figure 4. EDNS0 Compatibility 
Various failure modes were noted: 
•  FORMERR response, indicating that the proxy does not support EDNS0. 
•  Correctly formed truncated response with TC=1, indicating that the proxy does 
not support the client’s requested buffer size – this is standards compliant but still 
impacts DNSSEC compatibility (see Section 4). 
•  Malformed truncated response with TC=0, where only an initial portion of the 
upstream server's complete response is forwarded to the client. 
•  Malformed truncated response with TC=0, where the upstream server indicated 
truncation but the proxy cleared the flag. 
•  Upstream responses that exceed the proxy’s internal limits are dropped, resulting 
in no proxy response, causing client timeouts. 
•  One or more fragments from responses exceeding the MTU are dropped, 
resulting in client fragment reassembly timeouts. 
•  Client requests that contain an OPT RR are dropped by the proxy without 
response, causing client timeouts. 
•  Fragments of the proxy's response coming from the wrong Source IP address, 
causing the client to ignore the fragment. 
Where the proxy truncated the response, this was commonly either at 512 bytes (the
