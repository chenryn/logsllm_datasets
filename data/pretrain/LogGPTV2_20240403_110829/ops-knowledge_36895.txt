User: How to remotely control a server through IPMI interface?
Assistant: To remotely control a server through the IPMI interface, the following steps are required: 1. Make sure that an IPMI management card (such as Supermicro BMC or HP iLO) is installed on the server. 2. Connect the server and the Management Card. This usually requires using a dedicated network interface or connecting to the server's IPMI port via an Ethernet cable. 3. Log in to the web interface of the management card through the IP address or domain name of the management card. 4. Enter the management card user name and password to log in to the management card. 5. Select the server to be controlled remotely and enter the console. 6. From the console, you can use the keyboard, mouse, and monitor to control the server as you would locally. 7. Various operations can be performed on the console, such as restart, shut down, set BIOS, etc. 8. When you finish remote control and exit the console, all actions will be saved and applied on the server. In conclusion, the IPMI interface provides a very convenient and efficient way to manage servers remotely, enabling administrators to easily monitor and control servers from anywhere.
