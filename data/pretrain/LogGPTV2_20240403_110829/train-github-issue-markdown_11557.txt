### Environment Details
- **Dubbo Version:** 2.7.3
- **Operating System:** macOS Sierra
- **Java Version:** 1.8

### Issue Description
When an exception occurs, the request body is sometimes logged. This can lead to two primary concerns:
1. **Memory Overhead:** The logging of request bodies may consume additional memory resources, potentially impacting performance.
2. **Security Risks:** Sensitive information within the request body could be exposed through logs, leading to security vulnerabilities.

### Proposed Solution
To address these issues, I propose to implement a solution that will remove sensitive data from the logs for Dubbo protocol-related components, including but not limited to:
- `NettyChannel`
- `AbstractChannel`
- `DubboProtocol`

This will help in mitigating both the memory overhead and the potential security risks associated with logging request bodies during exceptions.
