### Environment
  * Dubbo version: 2.7.3
  * Operating System version: macOs Sierra
  * Java version: 1.8
### Steps to reproduce this issue
Sometimes, request body will be logged when exception occurs, which will
burden on the memory and cause security issue. I will work on to remove
sensitive data for dubbo protocol related, like NettyChannel, AbstractChannel,
DubboProtocol.
