User:  Please analyze what problems exist in the system based on the following information, and provide optimization suggestions
Assistant: The following are some suggestions for optimizing the network signal: 1. Distance: It is recommended to keep the distance between APs at least 10 meters, which can basically guarantee that there will be no more than 3 channel interference in the same location. 2. Type selection: High-performance multi-radio APs can be selected in areas with high population density; ordinary dual-radio APs can be selected in low-density areas. 3. Layout: If the roof structure is complex and there are a large number of metal pipe bridges, the AP should be installed on the suspension rod to ensure that the AP can be exposed correctly and avoid metal signal interference. 4. Forwarding mode: Using direct forwarding, management packets go to the AC, and traffic data goes directly to the upper-layer switch to reduce the load on the AC. 5. Channel allocation: 2.4G frequency band channel division, usually configure channels 1, 6, and 11 to ensure no interference between channels. 5.8G frequency band channel division, when there are many WIFIs around and channel interference is serious, foreign channel standards can be considered. In particular, channels 52-64 are radar channels, which are often interfered by non-wifi waves.
