User: I have installed python3 on Mac and I am trying to install pip.
While installing pip with command sudo easy_install pip it installs the pip for python 2.x which by default comes with Mac.
Is there any way I can install pip for python3?
Also, is it necessary to keep the older version of python installed as well?
Assistant: You'll have to specify the Python 3 version of easy_install. The easiest way to do this is to give its full path on the command line. It should be in the executable directory of the Python 3 installation you did (i.e. the same directory as the Python 3 interpreter itself).
You should not remove the system-installed Python 2 in an attempt to get easy_install to refer to Python 3, because the operating system relies on that version of Python being installed.
