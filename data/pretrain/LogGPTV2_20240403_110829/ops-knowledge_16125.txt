User:  In the cloud computing platform used by an enterprise, different services require different network topology diagrams. How to realize automatic network configuration?
Assistant: The following points need to be considered for automatic network configuration: 1. Write scripts or use automation tools: According to different services and network topology maps, write scripts or use automation tools for automatic configuration. Common automation tools include Ansible, Puppet, SaltStack, etc. 2. Define the network architecture of the cloud computing platform: define the network architecture in the cloud computing platform, including virtual networks, subnets, security groups, etc., to provide a basis for automatic configuration. 3. Combining the API of the cloud computing platform to implement configuration: realize the automatic configuration through the API provided by the cloud computing platform, and connect the network topology map and the automation script in series. 4. Integrate CI/CD process: Integrate automated configuration into CI/CD process to achieve continuous integration, continuous deployment and automated testing. To sum up, realizing automated network configuration requires technicians to have certain programming skills and knowledge about cloud computing platforms. For enterprises, it also needs to invest a certain amount of manpower and financial resources to promote the realization of automated configuration.
