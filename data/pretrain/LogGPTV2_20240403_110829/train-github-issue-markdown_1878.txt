Hi,
I tried this example : with-componentdidcatch
Basically, it's using `componentDidCatch` in the new `_app.js`. It intercepts
the errors and does a `console.log` when it intercepts one :
https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/02bcfb21c81bbc0f76ec8af22d4197952bd9bc15/examples/with-
componentdidcatch/pages/_app.js#L3-L9
## Expected Behavior
  * I see `CUSTOM ERROR HANDLING` in the server logs
## Current Behavior
  * I don't see `CUSTOM ERROR HANDLING` in the logs 
    * it's not in server logs
    * it's not in client logs
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
    npx create-next-app --example with-componentdidcatch with-componentdidcatch-app
    cd with-componentdidcatch-app
    yarn dev
## Context
The bigger picture here is trying to use error boundaries with next.js.
