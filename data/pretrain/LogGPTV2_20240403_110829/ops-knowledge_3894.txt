To effectively implement CIS Control 13.1, which focuses on centralizing security event alerting, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Centralize Log Collection**: Aggregate security event logs from all enterprise assets into a centralized system. This ensures that all relevant data is available in one place for correlation and analysis.

2. **Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System**: A SIEM system is essential for this control. It should be configured to collect, correlate, and analyze log data. The SIEM should include vendor-defined event correlation alerts to detect potential security incidents.

3. **Configure Correlation Alerts**: Set up the SIEM or a dedicated log analytics platform with predefined security-relevant correlation rules. These rules help in identifying patterns and anomalies that may indicate a security threat.

4. **Monitor and Analyze**: Continuously monitor the centralized system for alerts and perform regular analysis of the correlated events. This helps in detecting and responding to security incidents in a timely manner.

5. **Asset Type and Security Function**: Note that CIS Control 13.1 applies to the "Network" asset type and serves the "Detect" function within the cybersecurity framework.

By following these steps, an organization can ensure that security event alerting is centralized, enabling more effective detection and response to potential threats.
