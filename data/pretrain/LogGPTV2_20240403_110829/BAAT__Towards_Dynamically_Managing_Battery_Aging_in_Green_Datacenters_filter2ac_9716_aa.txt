## Abstract
Energy storage devices (batteries) have shown great promise in eliminating supply/demand power mismatches and reducing energy costs in green datacenters. However, these components progressively age due to irregular usage patterns, leading to reduced effective capacity and potential threats to server availability. Previous proposals often ignore battery aging or use ad-hoc discharge capping to extend their lifetime. To address this gap, we thoroughly investigate battery aging over a six-month period using a heavily instrumented prototype. We propose Battery Anti-Aging Treatment (BAAT), a novel framework for managing, reducing, and planning the effects of battery aging. Our results show that BAAT can extend battery lifetime by 69%, enabling datacenters to maximize the utilization of energy storage resources, enhance availability, and boost performance. Additionally, BAAT reduces battery costs by 26% and allows datacenters to scale economically in the big data era.

## 1. Introduction
The increasing adoption of distributed batteries at the server rack level is transforming the way datacenter power and energy are managed. Distributed batteries serve as critical energy buffers, enabling the exploitation of renewable energy resources to reduce datacenter carbon footprints and smooth out load power peaks, thereby significantly reducing total costs. These energy storage devices help maintain a continuous balance between power supply and demand, protecting sensitive loads from power disturbances. The global installed capacity of renewable energy batteries is projected to increase by 22 GW over the next decade, nearly matching the current global server power demand.

As the quantity, size, and utilization frequency of batteries in datacenters increase, they become a major design bottleneck. Most prior work focuses on managing server power demand, while battery aging has been largely overlooked. Batteries inevitably age, and without smart control, datacenter operators may incur high maintenance and replacement costs. Aged batteries often lose their effective energy storage capacity, posing serious threats to server availability. Overlooking aging issues can compromise the benefits of carbon emission reduction and cost savings brought by batteries.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Battery Deployment in Datacenters
Recent datacenter designs shift battery systems from the datacenter level to the server rack level to reduce power conversion losses and enable fine-grained power management. For example, Facebook's Open Rack project and Microsoft's in-rack battery design both use distributed battery systems. Google has also tested in-server lead-acid batteries to improve datacenter power usage effectiveness (PUE).

Datacenters are increasingly using batteries to reduce costs and improve sustainability, unlike traditional designs that primarily use batteries for power backup during grid outages. Batteries allow datacenters to shift load power (demand response) and integrate eco-friendly power sources like solar and wind energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy requires the use of batteries to smooth the variable power supply, making them the Achilles' heel in green datacenters.

### 2.2 Battery Aging Mechanisms
Battery aging refers to the gradual deterioration of inner materials and irreversible chemical reactions within the battery. Different types of batteries, such as lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, and lead-acid, have different aging mechanisms. This study focuses on lead-acid batteries, which account for over 97% of industry batteries due to their maturity, low cost, and easy maintenance.

One key aging mechanism is grid corrosion, where the high positive potential at the positive electrode causes lead grid corrosion. This process decreases the cross-sectional area of the grid and increases its resistance, leading to a drop in battery voltage and a reduction in the maximum energy that can be stored. The corrosion rate depends on factors such as acid density, electrode polarization, and battery temperature.

## 3. Battery Aging Impact Factors
We conducted a thorough battery aging analysis based on a one-year deployment experience with a state-of-the-art green datacenter prototype. Our scaled-down system combines a Xeon-based server cluster, solar panels, a professionally assembled battery array, and a custom-built software management console. Over six months, we continuously monitored detailed battery usage events and investigated various factors that induce aging.

## 4. BAAT Architecture and Aging Management Schemes
We propose Battery Anti-Aging Treatment (BAAT), an aging-aware power management framework for better coordinating massive amounts of batteries in green datacenters. BAAT offers three key benefits:

1. **Hiding Battery Aging Variation**: When adding new workloads or consolidating existing ones, BAAT intelligently identifies battery units that wear out faster than others and balances the aging effect across the battery units through an aging-driven load management policy.
2. **Slowing Down Battery Aging**: In cases where a battery is prone to wear out, such as when it is frequently used under low state of charge (SoC), BAAT leverages workload migration and power capping mechanisms to avoid aggressive discharging.
3. **Planning Battery Aging Speed**: BAAT proactively predicts battery lifetime and trades off unnecessary battery service life for better datacenter productivity, synchronizing battery life with the end-of-life of IT systems.

## 5. Experimental Methodology
We built a prototype and described the details of our implementation. We analyzed battery aging based on real deployment experience over six months and evaluated the effectiveness of BAAT.

## 6. Evaluation Results
Our results show that BAAT can improve battery lifetime by 69%, reduce battery deprecation cost by 26%, and boost performance by 28%.

## 7. Related Work
We discuss related work in the context of battery aging and power management in datacenters.

## 8. Conclusion
This paper presents BAAT, the first comprehensive framework for managing battery aging in green datacenters. BAAT addresses a critical yet often overlooked issue, providing a multifaceted approach to extending battery life, reducing costs, and enhancing datacenter performance.
