User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: The video was very useful.

Go to system properties -> Advance ( or type "system env" in
start menu.) 
Click environment variables
Edit the 'PATH' variable
Add 2 new paths 'C:\Python27' and 'C:\Python27\scripts'
Run cmd again and type python.

it worked for me
