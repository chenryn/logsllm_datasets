When I type `python` into the command line, the command prompt says: "python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file." What should I do? 

Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, you need to add the paths to your Python installations to the system's `PATH` environment variable. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Open System Properties:**
   - Press `Win + X` and select **System**.
   - Click on **Advanced system settings** on the left side.
   - Alternatively, you can search for "Edit the system environment variables" in the Start menu.

2. **Access Environment Variables:**
   - In the **System Properties** window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.

3. **Edit the PATH Variable:**
   - In the **Environment Variables** window, find the **Path** variable in the **System variables** section and select it.
   - Click **Edit**.

4. **Add Python Paths:**
   - In the **Edit Environment Variable** window, click **New** and add the following paths:
     - `C:\Python27`
     - `C:\Python27\Scripts`
     - `C:\Python32`
     - `C:\Python32\Scripts`
   - Click **OK** to close each dialog box.

5. **Verify the Setup:**
   - Open a new Command Prompt window (to ensure the changes take effect).
   - Type `python --version` to check if Python 3.2 is recognized.
   - If you need to use Python 2.7, you can specify it by typing `python2.7`.

By following these steps, you should be able to run Python from the command line without encountering the "not recognized" error.
