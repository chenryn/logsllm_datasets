User: Suppose you need to find a specific type of file in the Linux system, please give the corresponding command line operation.
Assistant: Use the find command to find specific types of files. For example, to find all .txt files: ``` find / -type f -name "*.txt" ``` Explanation: - `/` means to search from the root directory - `-type f` only finds files of type regular files (ordinary files) - `-name "*.txt"` The file name ends with .txt More ways to use the find command can be viewed through `man find`.
