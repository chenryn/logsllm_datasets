## Abstract
The security of the Internet's routing infrastructure has been a cornerstone of distributed systems security research over the past two decades. However, the reverse is increasingly true: routing and path decisions now significantly impact the security properties of systems built on the Internet. Specifically, BGP poisoning leverages the de facto routing protocol between Autonomous Systems (ASes) to redirect return paths onto new, previously unusable routes. These new paths can be used to avoid congestion, censors, geopolitical boundaries, or any feature expressible at the AS level. Given the growing use of BGP poisoning as a security mechanism, we aim to evaluate its practical feasibility beyond simulations.

Using a multi-country, multi-router, Internet-scale measurement infrastructure, we captured and analyzed over 1,400 instances of BGP poisoning across thousands of ASes. We detailed the performance of steering paths, the graph-theoretic aspects of available paths, and re-evaluated simulated systems with this data. Our findings indicate that real-world evidence does not fully support the results from simulated systems. We also analyzed BGP poisoning filtering across different types of ASes and ISP working groups. Additionally, we explored connectivity concerns by reproducing a decade-old experiment to assess the current state of an Internet that has tripled in size. We developed predictive models to understand an AS's vulnerability to poisoning. Finally, we provided an exhaustive measurement of the upper bound on the maximum path length of the Internet, detailing how recent and future security research should address ASes leveraging poisoning with long paths. Overall, our results and analysis aim to expose the real-world impact of BGP poisoning on past and future security research.

## I. Introduction
The Internet routing infrastructure ensures that packets reach their destination, playing a crucial role in the reachability, availability, and reliability of online services. The security of this infrastructure, comprising protocols and routing processes, has been a key focus of distributed systems security research for the past two decades. Conversely, routing and path decisions are now critical for the security of systems built on the Internet.

Recent research has harnessed the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), the de facto routing protocol on the Internet, to implement new offensive, defensive, and analytical systems. One such method, BGP poisoning, is increasingly used for censorship circumvention, DDoS defense, and topology discovery. BGP poisoning allows routing-capable entities, known as Autonomous Systems (ASes), to manipulate return traffic paths around specific AS-to-AS links, new regions of the Internet topology, and other regions of interest. For example, the Nyx system uses BGP to route around attacked links, while the LIFEGUARD system addresses single link failures. In the domain of censorship circumvention, decoy routing (DR) and the Routing Around Decoys (RAD) attack have become standard means to avoid censors.

However, some systems rely on the assumption that BGP poisoning is infeasible. For instance, the Waterfall of Liberty system and Adaptive Crossfire/Link-Flooding Attacks (LFA) assume BGP poisoning is impractical. This lack of real-world evidence on BGP poisoning's feasibility has led to conflicting claims in the research community, affecting network operators and leading to heated debates on the NANOG mailing list.

This paper presents the first comprehensive, real-world, Internet-scale measurements to validate or refute assumptions made in simulations or passive studies. We provide insights into using BGP poisoning for topology and congestion discovery, re-evaluate the Nyx DDoS defense platform, and examine the graph-theoretic aspects of return paths. We also build predictive models for ASes to understand their vulnerability to poisoning and analyze BGP poisoning filtering across different ASes and policies.

Our 6-month study, conducted from January 2018 to July 2018, employed a variety of control-plane and data-plane Internet infrastructure, including ASes from our organization and the broader Internet via PEERING, RIPE Atlas, and live BGP announcements from RouteViews and the RIPE Routing Information Service. We found that 77% of BGP poisoning instances could successfully maneuver onto new, previously unreachable AS-links, with an average of 8 new links and 3 completely new paths discovered per instance. BGP poisoning can route around 80% of ASes with fewer than 2,500 customers, and ASes can propagate paths up to 251 in length accepted by 99% of the Internet. We also found that the Nyx system performs 30% worse in practice than in simulation, and larger ASes and ISPs filter more poisons than smaller ones.

In the following sections, we delve deeper into these findings and their implications for existing security systems and Internet routing security.

## Contributions
- **Largest Measurement Study on BGP Poisoning**: We conducted the largest study to date, comprising 1,460 successful and 1,888 total poisoning cases. We publish our dataset, source code, and data analysis.
- **Reproduction of Simulated Results**: We reproduced recent security papers' simulations and passive measurements with active BGP poisoning on the live Internet.
- **Statistical Models**: We constructed statistical models to help AS operators utilize BGP poisoning without requiring active tests or senior IT approval.
- **Poisoned Path Filtering Analysis**: We assessed the extent and impact of poisoned path filtering from multiple perspectives.
- **Reassessment of Internet Behavior**: We reassessed the Internet's behavior regarding default routes and /25 reachability, a decade after the initial exploration.
