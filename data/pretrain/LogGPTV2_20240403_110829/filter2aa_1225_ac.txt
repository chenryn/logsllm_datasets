  - **Timing**: 48 hours straight (Friday-Sunday before Defcon).
  - **Location**: Remote.
  - **Teams**: 200+.
  - **Spoils**: Entry to the CTF finals.
- **Finals**:
  - **Style**: Defense and attack against other teams.

#### Game Mechanics
- **Qualifiers**:
  - **Challenges**: Categories include pursuits trivial, crypto badness, packet madness, binary l33tness, pwtent pwnables, and forensics.
  - **Board**: This year, DDTEK provided 30 challenges.
  - **Differences**: While there is some overlap between the qualifier and final games, they are quite different. It's possible to excel in one but not the other.

- **Finals**:
  - **Teams**: Top 7-9 teams from qualifiers plus the previous year's winner.
  - **Setup**: Each team gets an identical server to defend and attack others.
  - **Preparation**: General preparation can occur, but most work is on-the-fly.
  - **Score Bot**: Monitors services to ensure they are up and running, producing an SLA percentage that multiplies all other points.
  - **Flags**: Generated over time, must be tracked, and can be overwritten in vulnerabilities.
  - **Scoring System**: Zero-sum game, points divided proportionally among teams exploiting a service. No breakthrough points this year.

### Team Roles

- **Leader**:
  - **Responsibility**: Directs, coordinates, communicates, and ensures everyone is on task.
  - **Skills**: Best at managing and coordinating, not necessarily the best technical person.

- **NetAdmin**:
  - **Responsibility**: Maintains the network, configures firewalls, and monitors traffic.
  - **Skills**: Uses sniffers, IDS, and other tools to quickly recognize and adapt to attacks.

- **Reverser/Exploiter**:
  - **Responsibility**: Finds vulnerabilities and writes exploit code.
  - **Skills**: Essential for scoring points; must be proficient in both reversing and exploitation.

- **SysAdmin**:
  - **Responsibility**: Keeps the SLA up, ensuring the server remains operational.
  - **Skills**: Critical for maintaining high SLA, which multiplies all other points.

- **Defender**:
  - **Responsibility**: Helps the sysadmin maintain the server and makes life difficult for intruders.
  - **Skills**: Prepares shenanigans in advance and adapts on the fly to new setups.

- **Gopher**:
  - **Responsibility**: Handles logistics, food, and support tasks.
  - **Skills**: Ensures the team is well-supported and can focus on the competition.

### Teamwork
- **Importance**: Absolutely crucial for success.
- **Example**: 1@stplace won two years in a row by being good at all aspects, each member sticking to their role, and coordinating extremely well.

By emphasizing these roles and mechanics, teams can better prepare for and succeed in CTF competitions.
