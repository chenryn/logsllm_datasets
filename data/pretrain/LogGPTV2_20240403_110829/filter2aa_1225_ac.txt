Started two years ago with a core group from France, the Routards have expanded their 
membership in recent years to include members from Switzerland and Belgium as well.  Now 
it’s easiest to simply describe them as a French-speaking team.  
Mostly made up of InfoSec professionals doing CTF for fun, the team is led by hanzo, and I’ll 
spare you my mangled pronunciation of the rest of the team member’s handles!
One interesting bit of trivia; the routards are only one of three teams to have made it to all 
three of the last three years worth of ﬁnals along with the sexy pandas and  sk3wl of r00t).

Another of the Korean teams -- I dunno what’s in the water over there, but I hear that 
Starcraft is considered a real sport there.  Any place where that’s the case I imagine you’d 
have to get a bunch of awesome hackers.

Sapheads are another recent entry to the lineup of usual suspects, and are a meta-team 
composed of three other smaller groups that came together:

mechanics
Friday, July 31, 2009
As far as the game mechanics go, here’s the rundown:
First, the difference between Quals and the Finals, which I’ve mentioned brieﬂy, but haven’t 
explained yet.
They are two very different events.  While there is deﬁnitely some skill overlap, it doesn’t 
always transfer.  
Quals are more linear, they’re non-stop, and there’s a lot more variety to the type of 
problems.  There’s no defense, and a wider variety of esoteric topics and skills are usually 
covered.

Here’s a better breakdown -- of course, the exact details change each time.  This is the ﬁrst 
year with 10 teams participating in the ﬁnals, and the exact hours per day in the ﬁnals 
ﬂuxuates somewhat.  Some years it’s even been non-stop at defcon itself too
Friday, July 31, 2009
Here’s a screenshot of this year’s qualiﬁer board.  DDTEK deﬁnitely up’ed the ante, providing 
a whopping 30 challenges in the categories pursuits trivial, crypto badness, packet madness, 
binary l33tness, pwtent pwnables, and forensics.  
While there’s a lot of overlap between the qualiﬁer game and the ﬁnal game, they’re really 
fairly different.  It’s possible to be very good at one, but not as good at the other.
big show
Friday, July 31, 2009
The top 7 or 9 teams (along with the previous year’s winning team that gets an automatic 
berth) from the qualiﬁers make it to the main event.
At the ﬁnals, every team gets their own identical server, and they must not only defend their 
server, but attack all of their opponents as well.  While there are some general preparation 
that can occur, most of the time it’s all on-the-ﬂy patching and exploitation against custom, 
never-before-seen services.
A general framework for automated exploitation and key-submission is nice, but don’t put 
too much work into it in case you get a curve-ball like DTMF key submission process like the 
one from 2006.
Be prepared to possibly serve as the network infrastructure between your VM and the rest of 
the world.  This allows you to do some neat tricks with inline ﬁrewalls and packet ﬁltering, 
but also allows you to easily shoot yourself in the foot by dropping your server entirely 
offline.
A score bot is constantly monitoring the services you are running on your server, ensuring 
that services are up and running.  A ﬁnal tally of all successful services checks divided by the 
total number of service checks produces an SLA percentage that is multiplied by all other 
points.
Of course, to actually score points, you need to go out and capture some

ﬂags
Friday, July 31, 2009
ﬂags. 
First, there are lots and lots of ﬂags--they’re generated over time so that a team that is able 
to steal earlier and more often will be able to gather more ﬂags than their opponents.  
Second, each ﬂag must be tracked as to who it came from (I shouldn’t be able to submit a 
ﬂag that came from my own server, for example), and there’s also ﬂag used to overwrite 
existing ﬂags in vulnerabilities that have write access to a ﬂag.
Of course, the ability to detect ﬂag overwrites is also one of the most important reasons that 
jail or zone type of technology is usually used.  The score server must be able to monitor an 
overwritten key, and instantly replace it.  Otherwise, when the score server works on a polling 
interval, only one team will be able to get points during a given time interval.  That’s a bad 
thing since it incentivizes teams to blast out their overwrites as fast as possible to ensure 
their ﬂag is king of the hill.  An automated transparent overwrite detection with its own built-
in interval during which only one overwrite may be had by each team keeps that from 
happening.
One interesting twist is that this year the scoring system will be based on a zero-sum game.  
The available points for any given service will be divided up proportionally amongst the 
teams who exploit it.  It will be interesting to see what impact this has on the games score.  
This also does away with one of the other main features of previous Defcon scoring -- 
breakthrough points.  Breakthrough points were awarded for the ﬁrst team or two to succeed 
at any given exploit.  Harder services earned more breakthrough points.
While there’s certainly a fair amount of strategy in producing gameplay optimized toward the 
scoring system (for example -- if you are in second place, do you throw an exploit against 
the lead team that you know they haven’t landed yet, or do you hold on to it to try to keep 
Roles
Friday, July 31, 2009
A successful CTF team has a variety of specialized roles.  It’s not enough to simply be good 
at binary reverse engineering or exploitation.
Obviously, many of these roles may overlap, and some teams will operate differently, but 
generally speaking, a successful team will have something similar.

leader
Friday, July 31, 2009
The leader holds the team together.  This should be the person best able to direct, 
coordinate, communicate, and make sure everyone is on task and working together.  Try not 
to make this the best technical person in any other skillset if possible -- those folks should 
be spent doing what they do best, not herding cats.

netadmin
Friday, July 31, 2009
The NetAdmin not only must maintain the network and conﬁgure appropriate ﬁrewall rules, 
but most importantly is responsible for monitoring all network traffic.  Using sniffers, IDS or 
other signature matching systems, a good NetAdmin is crucial.  A successful CTF team is one 
that is able to very quickly recognize, adapt, and re-use exploits or other attacks sent against 
them.  The nose must work closely with both the exploiters and reversers, as well as the 
sysadmin/defenders to make sure they’re abreast of what others are attempting.

reversing
exploitation
Friday, July 31, 2009
No image on this slide.  I decided against an image search for “exploitation”.
The reverser/exploiter roles are often the same person, but not necessarily.  Sometimes the 
person who ﬁnds the vulnerability is not the best person to be writing the exploit code.  Make 
sure you maximize your time each doing what you do best.
While all of the roles truly are important to a winning team, if you don’t have people skilled in 
this area, you don’t stand a chance.  There’s simply no way to score points without being 
good at exploitation.  The qualiﬁer rounds ensure that any team that makes it to the ﬁnals 
can pull their weight in exploitation and reversing.
sysadmin
Friday, July 31, 2009
The sysadmin is responsible for keeping your SLA up.  Remember, SLA is a multiplier of /all 
other points/.  Never forget that.  Never make a change to a service if it will impact your SLA 
without carefully checking it out.  It’s better to let your opponents score on you and keep the 
server up than to take it down and take off a percentage of all your points.
Keep your SLA up at all times, and a good sysadmin is critical to that process.

defender
Friday, July 31, 2009
The defender is the guy whose job is not only to help the sysadmin in maintaining the server, 
but actively making life difficult for those intruding on the box.  While lots of shenanigans 
can (and should) be prepared in advance (ﬁnd ways to cripple libraries, move standard 
binaries, trojanize certain tools to better monitor attacks who get shells -- all in ways that 
allow legitimate services to keep running), much of it must be done on the ﬂy.  You never 
know if you’ll be getting the same setup as previous years, so putting too much work into 
work beforehand is risky.

teamwork
Friday, July 31, 2009
Let me emphasize this again.  Teamwork is absolutely crucial.
I don’t care how good you are at the individual skills, a team of individual superstars will not 
win. There are so many things going on and so much depends on being able to effectively 
communicate and work together in a high-pressure environment.  
1@stplace won two years in a row.  Neither time were we the sneakinest (ok, maybe we were 
close).  Neither time we were the best at getting the breakthrough exploits, neither time were 
we the best at defending our server from the attacks of others.  However, we were /good/ at 
all of those things, each person had a role, stuck to it will, and we coordinated extremely well
