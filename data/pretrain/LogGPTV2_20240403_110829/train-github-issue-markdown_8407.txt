As of commit `61d283e` in the `devel` branch, I encountered an issue with the following `test.yaml` playbook:

```yaml
- name: derp
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: derp
      command: echo
```

When I run the playbook using the following command:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i foo.com, test.yaml -vv
```
I receive the following error:
```
PLAY [derp] *******************************************************************
ERROR: host not found: localhost
```

To further investigate, I used the `--list-hosts` option to check the hosts being targeted:
```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i foo.com, test.yaml -vv --list-hosts
```
The output is as follows:
```
playbook: test.yaml
  play #1 (derp): host count=1
    localhost
```

Upon initial investigation, it appears that the issue may be related to the insertion of variable data. I will conduct a more thorough analysis, but I wanted to document this simple reproducer for reference.

If you have any additional insights or suggestions, please let me know.
