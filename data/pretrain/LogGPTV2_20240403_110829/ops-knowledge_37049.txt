I'm trying to install `cx_Oracle` with Python 2.7.11, but all the tutorials I've found require root access, which I don't have for the `/usr` or `/etc` folders on my virtual machine. Is there any way to install `cx_Oracle` in my user directory?

**Answer:**

Yes, you can install `cx_Oracle` in your user directory by following these steps:

1. **Download and Unpack the Source Archive:**
   - Download the `cx_Oracle` source archive from the official repository or a trusted source.
   - Unpack the archive to a directory where you have write access.

2. **Build the Library:**
   - Navigate to the unpacked directory.
   - Run the following command to build the library:
     ```sh
     python setup.py build
     ```

3. **Locate the Built Library:**
   - After the build process completes, locate the `cx_Oracle.so` file. It will typically be in a subdirectory named `build` within the unpacked directory.

4. **Copy the Library (Optional):**
   - If you prefer, you can copy the `cx_Oracle.so` file to a location of your choice where you have write access. For example:
     ```sh
     cp build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/cx_Oracle.so /path/to/your/directory
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can leave the `cx_Oracle.so` file in the build directory.

5. **Set the `PYTHONPATH` Environment Variable:**
   - To make the `cx_Oracle` module available to your Python environment, set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the directory containing `cx_Oracle.so`. You can do this in your shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) or directly in your terminal session:
     ```sh
     export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/directory:$PYTHONPATH
     ```
   - Replace `/path/to/your/directory` with the actual path where `cx_Oracle.so` is located.

By following these steps, you should be able to use `cx_Oracle` in your Python 2.7.11 environment without needing root access.
