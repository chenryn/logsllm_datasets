User: Im trying to install cx_oracle with python2.7.11. all the tutorials i found for installing cx_oracle needs root access, however on the vm i dont have root access on the /usr or /etc folders. Is there any way to install cx_oracle in my user directory?
Assistant: Yes, you can simply follow these steps:

Download the source archive and unpack it somewhere.
Run the command "python setup.py build"
Copy the library to a location of your choice where you do have access (or you can simply leave it in the build location, too, if you prefer)
Set the environment variable PYTHONPATH to point to the location of cx_Oracle.so
