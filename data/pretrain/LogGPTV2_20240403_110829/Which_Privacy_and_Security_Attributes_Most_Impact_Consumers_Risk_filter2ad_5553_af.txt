TABLE II: We used CLMM and built two models to identify the signiﬁcance of various factors in changing participants’ risk perception and willingness to
purchase. The Nagelkerke R2 values for the risk perception and willingness to purchase models are 0.74 and 0.68, respectively. The Cox & Snell values for the
risk perception and willingness to purchase models are 0.71 and 0.65, respectively [76]. For the security and privacy attribute-value pairs, except for the control
over attribute, our models capture three levels of each attribute, i.e., most protective, least protective, and absent (i.e., not shown), while they capture four
levels for the control over attribute, namely its three most protective levels as well as absent.
model, a positive estimate indicates an increase in participants’
desire to purchase the smart device, and a negative estimate
indicates hesitance to purchase, all compared to the baseline.
Since we showed three scenarios to each participant, there
might exist two-way or three-way interaction effects among
the presented attribute-value pairs. An interaction term is
statistically deﬁned between levels of multiple distinct factors,
while in our constructed model, attribute-value pairs are
the levels of the same factor (sp_attribute_value).
Therefore, our model is not able to capture such potential
interactions. As full privacy and security labels would include
multiple attribute-value pairs, future studies should carefully
explore the interactions among the presented factors.
Privacy and Security Information. In both models, all the
privacy and security attribute-value pairs signiﬁcantly changed
participants’ risk perception and willingness to purchase. For
almost all of these pairs, the direction of the change was aligned
with our hypothesis (see Table I), except for the average time to
patch. The Underwriters Lab (UL) guidelines suggest that the
most severe vulnerabilities should be patched within 1 month
and less severe vulnerabilities within 3 months [77]. Thus, we
hypothesized that participants’ perceived risk would decrease

Fig. 1: Based on the CLMM parameters in the baseline condition (i.e., all the model factors, except sp_attribute_value, being at their baseline values),
we computed and plotted the probabilities of each privacy and security attribute-value pair increasing, decreasing, or having no impact on risk perception (Left
Fig: 1a) and willingness to purchase (Right Fig: 1b).

if vulnerabilities were patched within 1 month, and increase
if they were patched within 6 months. However, the ﬁndings
from the CLMMs show that average time to patch of both 1
month and 6 months strongly increase the perceived risk and
decrease willingness to purchase (see Table II, rows 16 and 10).
In fact, most of our participants reported that they would like
the company to patch vulnerabilities within a few days.
The CLMM results show that data being sold to third parties
(Table II, row 1) and having no control over access (Table II,
row 2) had the biggest impact on increasing participants’ risk
perception, whereas no cloud retention (Table II, row 32) and
data not being shared with third parties (Table II, row 31)
had the biggest
impact on decreasing the perceived risk.
The direction of the impact of attribute-value pairs in the
willingness to purchase model was similar to the risk perception
model. However, the relative importance of the attribute-value
pairs were not exactly the same across the two models. For
instance, knowing information would not be shared most
inﬂuenced willingness to purchase while no cloud retention
most inﬂuenced risk perception.
Comparing the odds ratios in Table II, we observe that for
all the least protective values, the odds ratios of increasing
risk perception are higher than their corresponding odds ratios
of decreasing the desire to purchase. Similarly, for all the
most protective attribute-value pairs except average time to
patch: 1 month, the odds ratios of decreasing risk perception
are higher than their corresponding odds ratios of increasing
willingness to purchase. This implies that the tested privacy and
security attribute-value pairs were more powerful in changing
participants’ risk perception than in changing their willingness
to purchase. From the open-ended responses, we observe
a possible explanation: Participants report that privacy and
security are among many factors they consider when purchasing
a device. Several participants who reported that a privacy
and security attribute-value does not have an impact on their
willingness to purchase mentioned that their willingness to
purchase the smart device is driven by its price or features.
Figure 1 illustrates the probabilities of the ﬁve response
categories for risk perception and willingness to purchase based
on the CLMM estimates. Our analysis shows that participants
are signiﬁcantly more likely to specify an increase rather than
a decrease in risk perception for all the least-protective values.
The reverse trend was also mostly true for the most protective
values. There were, however, a few exceptions. We found that
the attribute-value pairs security audit: internal & external,
purpose: device function, and average time to patch: 1 month
led to a considerable probability of increased risk perception
(21%, 41%, and 68%, respectively), suggesting that these
attribute-value pairs may not be clear. We discuss the open-
ended responses that provide insights into these unexpected
ﬁndings in Section IV-E. As the ﬁgure shows, unlike their
most protective values, the least protective values purpose:
monetization and average time to patch: 6 months had a large
impact on increasing risk perception and decreasing willingness
to purchase.
Figure 2 shows jitter (scatter) plots of participants’ perceived
risk levels and willingness to purchase when presented with
attributes alongside their most and least protective values. As
the plots demonstrate, the correlation between risk perception
and willingness to purchase differs based on the attribute. For
instance, Figure 2a shows that most participants perceived
multi-factor authentication (MFA) as decreasing risk (89%)
and no access control as increasing risk (97%). While this
was generally consistent with their willingness to purchase, the
ﬁgure shows that some participants who perceived MFA as risk
reducing were actually no more likely or even less likely to
purchase a device with MFA (31%). Our qualitative responses
suggest
this is mainly due to MFA usability challenges.
Likewise, Figure 2b shows that most participants perceived no
sharing as decreasing risk (85%) and sharing with third parties
as increasing risk (95%). However, in this case, risk perception
was much more likely to be correlated with willingness to
