**Table II:**

We used Cumulative Link Mixed Models (CLMM) to identify the significance of various factors in changing participants' risk perception and willingness to purchase. The Nagelkerke R² values for the risk perception and willingness to purchase models are 0.74 and 0.68, respectively. The Cox & Snell R² values for the risk perception and willingness to purchase models are 0.71 and 0.65, respectively [76]. For the security and privacy attribute-value pairs, except for the control over attribute, our models capture three levels of each attribute: most protective, least protective, and absent. For the control over attribute, they capture four levels: its three most protective levels and absent.

In the model, a positive estimate indicates an increase in participants' desire to purchase the smart device, and a negative estimate indicates hesitance to purchase, all compared to the baseline. Since we showed three scenarios to each participant, there might exist two-way or three-way interaction effects among the presented attribute-value pairs. An interaction term is statistically defined between levels of multiple distinct factors, while in our constructed model, attribute-value pairs are the levels of the same factor (sp_attribute_value). Therefore, our model is not able to capture such potential interactions. As full privacy and security labels would include multiple attribute-value pairs, future studies should carefully explore the interactions among the presented factors.

### Privacy and Security Information

In both models, all the privacy and security attribute-value pairs significantly changed participants' risk perception and willingness to purchase. For almost all these pairs, the direction of the change was aligned with our hypothesis (see Table I), except for the average time to patch. The Underwriters Lab (UL) guidelines suggest that the most severe vulnerabilities should be patched within 1 month and less severe vulnerabilities within 3 months [77]. Thus, we hypothesized that participants' perceived risk would decrease if vulnerabilities were patched within 1 month and increase if they were patched within 6 months. However, the findings from the CLMMs show that an average time to patch of both 1 month and 6 months strongly increases the perceived risk and decreases willingness to purchase (see Table II, rows 16 and 10). In fact, most of our participants reported that they would like the company to patch vulnerabilities within a few days.

The CLMM results show that data being sold to third parties (Table II, row 1) and having no control over access (Table II, row 2) had the biggest impact on increasing participants' risk perception, whereas no cloud retention (Table II, row 32) and data not being shared with third parties (Table II, row 31) had the biggest impact on decreasing the perceived risk.

The direction of the impact of attribute-value pairs in the willingness to purchase model was similar to the risk perception model. However, the relative importance of the attribute-value pairs was not exactly the same across the two models. For instance, knowing information would not be shared most influenced willingness to purchase, while no cloud retention most influenced risk perception.

Comparing the odds ratios in Table II, we observe that for all the least protective values, the odds ratios of increasing risk perception are higher than their corresponding odds ratios of decreasing the desire to purchase. Similarly, for all the most protective attribute-value pairs except average time to patch: 1 month, the odds ratios of decreasing risk perception are higher than their corresponding odds ratios of increasing willingness to purchase. This implies that the tested privacy and security attribute-value pairs were more powerful in changing participants' risk perception than in changing their willingness to purchase. From the open-ended responses, we observe a possible explanation: Participants report that privacy and security are among many factors they consider when purchasing a device. Several participants who reported that a privacy and security attribute-value does not have an impact on their willingness to purchase mentioned that their willingness to purchase the smart device is driven by its price or features.

**Figure 1:**

Based on the CLMM parameters in the baseline condition (i.e., all the model factors, except sp_attribute_value, being at their baseline values), we computed and plotted the probabilities of each privacy and security attribute-value pair increasing, decreasing, or having no impact on risk perception (Left Fig: 1a) and willingness to purchase (Right Fig: 1b).

**Figure 2:**

Jitter (scatter) plots of participants' perceived risk levels and willingness to purchase when presented with attributes alongside their most and least protective values. As the plots demonstrate, the correlation between risk perception and willingness to purchase differs based on the attribute. For instance, Figure 2a shows that most participants perceived multi-factor authentication (MFA) as decreasing risk (89%) and no access control as increasing risk (97%). While this was generally consistent with their willingness to purchase, the figure shows that some participants who perceived MFA as risk-reducing were actually no more likely or even less likely to purchase a device with MFA (31%). Our qualitative responses suggest this is mainly due to MFA usability challenges. Likewise, Figure 2b shows that most participants perceived no sharing as decreasing risk (85%) and sharing with third parties as increasing risk (95%). However, in this case, risk perception was much more likely to be correlated with willingness to purchase.
