User: I'm having a lot of trouble getting Eclipse to recognise PyDev when using the PyDev zip file. (I need to use the zip file as the Dev machine does not have internet access).
I have Eclipse installed and have downloaded the PyDev zip. I've Googled a fair bit and tried the following based on suggestions I found:-

Unzipped the .zip into ECLIPSE/helios/dropins and restarted eclipse.
Unzipped the .zip into ECLIPSE/helios/plugins and restarted eclipse.

Neither makes Python appear as a selection in the Eclipse, Window, Preferences.
Helios contains the executable eclipse file I use to load eclipse.
I'm using eclipse in Redhat linux.
One suggestion was to extract the zip over the eclipse plugins and features folders, but I don't see how that would work as the zip just produces a heap of files and no folders.
Any help to get this working would be great.
Assistant: For whatever it's worth, I was having the same problem running eclipse 3.6 on RHEL 6. When I ran eclipse as myself, I didn't get any PyDev options; however, when I ran eclipse as root, everything showed up. So permissions could be an issue fyi.
