User: I am using mod_wsgi with apache to serve the python application. I have a directive in the VirtualHost entry as follows WSGIScriptAlias /app /home/ubuntu/www/app.wsgi. I also have DocumentRoot /home/ubuntu/www/. Therefore, if the user attempts to read /app.wsgi it gets the raw file. If I try to block access to it via .htaccess, the application becomes unusable. How do I fix this? Is there a way to do so without moving the file out of the DocumentRoot?
Assistant: This is far from the best option, but it does seem to work: I added WSGIScriptAlias /app.wsgi /home/ubuntu/www/app.wsgi to the VirtualHost as well so that it will run the app on that uri instead of returning the raw file.
