User: I've installed python 2.6 from source, and somehow later mistakenly installed another python 2.6 from a package manager too.
I can't find a way to uninstall a python that was built from source, is this possible/easy?
Running ubuntu 10.04.
Assistant: Do you still have the source directory where you compiled Python before? If so, you can CD into that directory and run sudo make uninstall.
If you don't have it still, you could re-create it by going through the build steps again--download, extract, configure, and make--but end with sudo make uninstall instead of sudo make install, of course.
