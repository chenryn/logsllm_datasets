### Overview of Skimmer Modules and Settings

All four skimmer modules were found in their default settings, including the name and PIN. Table III lists the AT commands used to view and modify these settings.

### Consumer Card Data and Skimmer Mechanisms

Consumers using debit or credit cards often need to enter a PIN or ZIP code to authorize transactions. This data is also valuable to attackers, who can use it for cloning debit cards and withdrawing cash from ATMs. Therefore, many skimmers include a passthrough mechanism to capture PIN pad entries. Below, we summarize the specific components and construction of each skimmer:

- **Skimmer S-01:**
  - Built using a PIC-based microcontroller and an STMicroelectronics flash memory chip for storing card data.
  - Uses an HC-05 Bluetooth module for wireless data retrieval.
  - Configured with the name "HC-05" and PIN "1234" when received.

- **Skimmer S-02:**
  - Identical to Skimmer S-01 but includes an additional passthrough cable to intercept PIN entry directly from the PIN pad.

- **Skimmer S-03:**
  - Similar to Skimmers S-01 and S-02, but with a different flash memory chip and an RN42 Bluetooth module.
  - Capable of intercepting PIN entry like S-02.

- **Skimmer S-04:**
  - Transfers card data via a wired connection and does not use a Bluetooth or other wireless communication module.
  - Has a different processor architecture and flash memory, making it the most unique among the skimmers received.
  - Not capable of capturing PIN pad data (like S-01).

- **Skimmer S-05:**
  - Identical to Skimmer S-03, with the same voltage and configuration issues.

### Detection Experiment

**Figure 3:** Each skimmer was powered on, and attempts were made to detect them using various apps. Blue squares indicate detection, while orange squares indicate no detection. Skimmers S-03 and S-05 were not detected due to incorrect setup upon receipt. As expected, no applications detected S-04, which lacks a Bluetooth module.

**Table III: AT Commands for Bluetooth Module Configuration**

| Purpose of Command | HC-05 | RN42 |
|--------------------|-------|------|
| Get Module Password | `AT+PSWD?` | `GP` |
| Get Module Name | `AT+NAME?` | `GB` |
| Get Module MAC Address | `AT+RNAME?` | N/A |
| Set Module Password | `AT+PSWD=` | `SP,` |
| Set Module Name | `AT+NAME=` | `SN,` |

### Detection Effectiveness

We powered on each skimmer in our lab without modification and attempted to detect them using the apps from Section III. The results are shown in Figure 3. Apps A, B, and C successfully detected S-01 and S-02. Since Skimmers S-04 and S-06 do not have Bluetooth modules, they cannot be detected by any app. Apps D, E, and F are incapable of detecting Bluetooth skimmers; similarly, App G only detects Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.

Skimmers S-03 and S-05, equipped with an RN42 Bluetooth module, were not detected in their default configuration. Upon investigation, we found that the RN42 does not transmit data without proper configuration. Unlike the HC-05, the RN42 must be properly set up to begin transmission. It is possible that these devices were deployed without the intent of wireless data retrieval. If properly configured, Skimmers S-03 and S-05 would be detected by App C, which uses MAC address as a detection criterion.

**Figure 4:** This matrix shows the detection results after configuration changes intended to evade detection. Apps A and B no longer detect the skimmers, while App C still detects S-01 and S-02 based on MAC address.

### Evading Detection

#### Firmware Modifications
Detection methods are brittle, and alterations to the Bluetooth module's configuration can make it appear as a normal device. Using AT commands, it is easy to change the name and PIN. We modified the settings on each Bluetooth-enabled skimmer and ran the apps again. For Skimmers S-01 and S-02, we changed the names to "Not a Skimmer" and the passwords to "5678." The remaining skimmers did not have Bluetooth or were not enabled, so they were excluded from this experiment.

**Figure 4:** App results after reconfiguring the Bluetooth modules. Apps A and B failed as their first check is the deviceâ€™s name. No other app improved its success rate, demonstrating that simple changes dramatically affect detectability. App C continued to detect the skimmers based on MAC address prefix.

#### Hardware Modifications
Evasion can also be achieved by selecting a Bluetooth module from a manufacturer that uses a different MAC address prefix. From our lab's collection, we found four similarly-priced Bluetooth modules from different manufacturers that did not trigger detection by any of the apps. These modules are readily available and could easily be fitted onto a gas pump skimmer.

### Additional Considerations

**Skimmer S-06:**
- Uses a common and inexpensive cellular module that communicates over GSM networks.
- Although GSM is being phased out in the United States, it is still used in many locations, especially rural areas. Transitioning to a 3G module is trivial and maintains the same detection challenges.

### Lessons Learned

Out of the six skimmers, two did not use Bluetooth, making smartphone detection impossible. Existing skimmer detection apps assume all skimmers use similar Bluetooth modules, which is not the case. Even the best skimmer detection apps are not very effective against slightly determined attackers. MAC address detection can result in false positives and can be defeated in various ways.

### Detecting Skimmers in Practice

#### Tamper-Evident Seals
Tamper-evident seals represent the only externally visible indicator of tampering. However, several issues arise:
- **Presence:** Should a seal be present? Some stations apply seals, while others do not.
- **Placement:** Is the seal correctly placed? It should break or indicate "VOID" if the door is opened.
- **Intent:** What is the purpose of the seal? Some may be confused as temporary repairs.
- **Identity:** Is this the correct seal? Branded and municipal seals are common, and consumers must recognize them.
- **Indication:** Is the seal currently indicating tampering? Seals can be broken, stretched, or sliced.

These seals produce a "time of check to time of use" (TOCTTOU) vulnerability, requiring consumer awareness. Daily checks by owners can mitigate some damage, but high-traffic locations can still be compromised within 24 hours. Consumers have the best opportunity to inspect indicators before committing to a transaction.

**Figures 6 and 7:** Real-world conditions and examples of tamper-evident seals, highlighting the challenges in evaluating their integrity.

### Conclusion

The tools available to consumers are insufficient to protect against skimmers. While tamper-evident seals provide some indication, they require consumer vigilance and understanding. The deployment of low-cost tamper-evident seals has shifted the responsibility to consumers, who must inspect these indicators before using the pump.
