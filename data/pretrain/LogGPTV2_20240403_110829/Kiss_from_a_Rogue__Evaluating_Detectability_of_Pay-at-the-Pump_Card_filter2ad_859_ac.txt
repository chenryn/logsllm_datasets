on the modules. All four modules were still in their default
settings, including the name and PIN. Table III provides a list
of AT commands we used to view and alter the settings.

hardware components identiﬁed. We added the non-ribbon
wires during analysis.
Consumers using debit or credit cards often need to enter
a PIN or ZIP code to successfully authorize their cards.
Since this data is also valuable to attackers (e.g., for cloning
debit cards and cashing out at ATMs), many skimmers also
include a passthrough mechanism for capturing PIN pad entry.
We examine the speciﬁc components of each skimmer and
summarize their construction below:
Skimmer S-01 is built using a PIC-based microcontroller
and an STMicroelectronics ﬂash memory chip for storing
card data. The skimmer uses an HC-05 Bluetooth module
for wireless data retrieval. When we took possession of this
skimmer, it was conﬁgured with the name HC-05 and PIN
1234.
Skimmer S-02 is identical to Skimmer S-01, except that it
is also capable of intercepting PIN entry directly from the PIN
pad via an additional passthrough cable.
Skimmer S-03 is similar in construction to Skimmers S-01
and S-02. However, the ﬂash memory chip is different on this
skimmer and it uses an RN42 Bluetooth module. Like S-02,
this skimmer is also capable of intercepting PIN entry.
Skimmer S-04 differs most signiﬁcantly from the others
we examined. This skimmer transfers card data via a wired
connection and does not use a Bluetooth or other wireless
communication module. Both the processor architecture and
ﬂash memory differ, making this skimmer the most unique of
the ones we received. This skimmer is not capable of capturing
PIN pad data (like S-01).
Skimmer S-05 is identical to Skimmer S-03. The voltage

Fig. 3: We powered on each skimmer and attempted to detect
them using each app. The blue squares indicate a detection,
while the orange squares indicate that the app could not detect
the skimmer. Because S-03 and S-05 were not set up correctly
when we received them, they were not detected. As expected,
no applications detect S-04 since it does not have a Bluetooth
module.

TABLE III: A list of AT commands for changing parameters on
the Bluetooth modules in efforts to prevent detection. The AT
commands for the HC-05 are in traditional format while they
are simpliﬁed for the RN42. Many other commands exist for
both modules and can easily be found in their documentation.
C. Detection Effectiveness
We powered on each skimmer without modiﬁcation in
our lab and attempted to detect them using the apps from
Section III. The results of this experiment are shown in
Figure 3. Apps A, B, and C successfully detected S-01 and
S-02. Since Skimmers S-04 and S-06 do not have Bluetooth
modules, they cannot be detected by any app. Apps D, E, and
F are incapable of detecting Bluetooth skimmers; similarly,
App G is unable to detect any of these skimmers as it only
detects Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices.
Skimmers S-03 and S-05 are equipped with an RN42
Bluetooth module and were not detected in their default
conﬁguration, though App C looks for this module’s MAC
address preﬁx. Upon further investigation, we discovered that
this is because the RN42 does not transmit data without ﬁrst
being properly conﬁgured. Unlike the HC-05 module,
the
RN42 cannot simply be soldered into a circuit and begin
transmission; these devices were in an initial conﬁguration
state and were not enabled. It is possible that these devices
were deployed without the intent of being able to retrieve card
data wirelessly, though we are unable to verify this. Skimmers
S-03 and S-05 would be detected by App C if they were
properly conﬁgured, however, they were not and we recorded
them as undetectable. Even in the event that the modules were
properly conﬁgured, the RN42 Bluetooth module possesses
additional features that can prevent the device from being seen
unless in the presence of a separate Bluetooth device that is
currently broadcasting a predetermined MAC address.
Fig. 4: This matrix shows which apps successfully detected
each skimmer after conﬁguration changes intended to evade.
Apps A and B no longer work at detecting the skimmers. App
C still detects Skimmers S-01 and S-02, as it only uses MAC
Address as a detection criteria.
D. Evading Detection
Firmware Modiﬁcations As we have discussed, the detection
methods are extremely brittle. Alterations can be made to the
Bluetooth module’s conﬁguration that take advantage of the
detection criteria, allowing it to appear as a normal Bluetooth
device. Using the AT commands built into the ﬁrmware on
the Bluetooth modules, it is trivial to change both the name
and PIN. We modiﬁed the settings on each of the Bluetooth-
enabled skimmers and ran each app again. For Skimmers S-
01 and S-02, we changed the names to Not a Skimmer and
the passwords to 5678. Since the remaining skimmers did not
have Bluetooth or it was not enabled, we excluded them from
this experiment.
Figure 4 displays the app results after reconﬁguring the
Bluetooth modules. As expected, Apps A and B failed com-
pletely as their ﬁrst check is the device’s name. No other app
improved its success rate after these changes, demonstrating
that these simple changes dramatically affect the detectability
of the skimmers. App C continued to detect the skimmers
(shown with Skimmer S-03 in Figure 5), as it detects solely
on MAC address preﬁx.
As we see in App C, this leaves the MAC address as the
only remaining detection criterion. Though not as easy as with
a standard computer Bluetooth module, spooﬁng the MAC
address on the Bluetooth modules used in the skimmers is
relatively simple. Because of the affordability of the Bluetooth
modules used in skimmers, the features built into the standard
ﬁrmware are limited. Neither module provides an AT command
that allow the MAC address to be spoofed, however the
developers of both modules provide software that allow users
to overwrite the ﬁrmware. Adding Bluetooth spooﬁng to the
ﬁrmware of both of these modules is entirely possible and
would allow a user to eliminate the only remaining criteria that
existing apps use for detection” would be reasonable. Other
similar Bluetooth modules provide additional features such as
MAC address spooﬁng.
Hardware Modiﬁcations Evasion can also be accomplished
by selecting a Bluetooth module from a manufacturer that uses
a different MAC address preﬁx. From our lab’s collection of
extra electronics components, we found four similarly-priced
Bluetooth modules (from different manufacturers), that did not
trigger a detection by any of the apps. All four are readily
available from online electronics distributors and could easily
be ﬁtted onto a gas pump skimmer.

Skimmer S-06
uses a fairly common and inexpensive cellular module that uses
GSM networks. Though GSM technology is being phased out
in the United States, GSM is still used in a variety of locations
and is especially popular in many rural areas. Even if GSM
were to be completely phased out, transitioning to a module
that communicates over 3G networks is trivial and maintains
the same detection challenges.
E. Lessons Learned
Out of the skimmers we received, two of the six did not
use Bluetooth. Detecting these skimmers with a smartphone
is not possible, regardless of app construction. The skimmer
detection apps that exist are built on the assumption that all
skimmers use similar Bluetooth modules for data retrieval,
which is not the case. Though the idea of allowing anyone with
a smartphone to detect nearby skimmers is seemingly attractive
in terms of deployment, apps are not a solution to the problem
of gas pump skimmers, and as these attacks evolve, they can
only become less effective.
Considering Bluetooth skimmers alone, even the best skim-
mer detection apps are still not very effective, especially
against a slightly determined attacker. From our hardware eval-
uation, only a few detection apps successfully detect skimmers,
and most of these are easily evaded with trivial conﬁguration
changes. Though attempting to detect skimmers based on the
MAC address of their Bluetooth modules will result
in a
successful detection regardless of conﬁguration with standard
ﬁrmware,
this introduces substantially more false positives
than true positives. Regardless, MAC address detection can
be defeated in a variety of other ways.
V. DETECTING SKIMMERS IN PRACTICE
As we have demonstrated through our software and hard-
ware forensic analysis in the previous two sections, the tools
available to consumers are ill-equipped to protect them from
skimmers. Accordingly, we look to the mechanisms used by
pump owners/operators to indicate that a compromise may
have occurred. We then augment these observations using a
long-term analysis of nearly four years of data collected by the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services on
the location, condition, and security measures in place where
gas pump skimmers have been found.
A. Tamper-Evident Seals
Tamper-evident seals [30] represent
the only externally
visible indicator of tampering (other than physical damage)
of the security controls permitted by the State of Florida.
Even if these seals are perfect, two problems arise: ﬁrst, the
seals would ideally be uniform in appearance and placement
across locations. Figure 6 shows photos of pumps as we
encountered them during the development of this work; these
photos demonstrate real-world conditions. At a minimum,
accurate inspection of seals requires consumers and employees
to understand:
• Presence: Should a seal be present? Some stations apply
seals and some do not, depending on other security
features present (e.g., card readers that encrypt data prior
to transmission as discussed in Section II).
Fig. 5: This is a screenshot of a Google Pixel 2 running App
C while Skimmer S-02 is powered on. The skimmer is the
device second from the bottom of the list. The app indicates
that the device is a skimmer by assigning it a red icon instead
of green. This app also listed 14 other devices in this running
instance that are not shown in this image; the user must scroll
through the list to ﬁnd the detected device.
Ultimately, further additions to the MAC preﬁx blacklist
of App C is unsustainable. This use of such a list increases
the number of possible false positives disproportionately to
the number of skimmers it will detect. Any device that
legitimately uses a Bluetooth module manufactured by one of
the companies on the list will cause the app to create a false
positive. Many Bluetooth devices are naturally at gas stations
(including cars, phones, watches, etc.) that could potentially
cause the application to induce an alarm.
Gas pump skimmers can also use wired communication
methods that render the detection apps useless. Skimmer S-
04 uses wired USB communication to transfer card data and
cannot be detected by a smartphone. All of the skimmers can
be dumped using a ﬂash memory reader connected directly
to the ﬂash chip, provided the attackers are willing to risk
retrieving the skimmer from the pump. Skimming attacks that
use overlay skimmers need to be retrieved for recharging and
data retrieval [45], so this is not a new method for obtaining
card data.
Skimmers are also constructed using other wireless com-
munication methods, such as Skimmer S-06 which uses SMS
over GSM. Using a cellular module not only prevents detection
by apps, but also allows the adversary to retrieve card data from
nearly anywhere. Unlike Bluetooth, cellular communication is
not able to be detected with a mobile device and creates legal

(a) This pump is normal. It has a single, unbroken,
correctly-placed seal.
(b) This pump has no seal.
(c) This pump has ﬁve seals.
(d) This pump has a single, unbroken seal. It is placed
on the hinge of the door, however, making it unlikely
to break if the door is opened.
Fig. 6: These photos demonstrate the real-world conditions in which tamper-evident seals must be evaluated. These seals are
predominantly targeted at consumers, who must decide if a pump is safe to use before beginning a pay-at-the-pump transaction.
• Placement: Is the seal placed correctly on the pump?
The seal needs to be placed where the seal will break
or indicate (i.e., by showing “VOID”) when the door is
opened. Figure 6d shows a seal placed on the hinge of
an access door. Such a placement is unlikely to indicate
tampering if the door has been opened.
• Intent: What is the purpose of the seal? In some circum-
stances (such as shown in Figure 6c), the seals could be
confused as an attempt to perform a short-term repair of
a broken door or lock.
• Identity: Is this the correct seal? Figure 6 shows pumps
that have branded seals (e.g., a Shell-branded seal at a
Shell gas station) and Figure 7 shows a municipal seal.
Replacement seals are readily available on the Internet,
and the consumer or employee must know whether the
seal visually matches the expected seal. Some seals in-
clude serial numbers, which can be logged and referenced
later.
• Indication: Is the seal currently indicating tampering?
including
Seals can be broken in a variety of ways,
stretching, displaying VOID (or similar), and slicing
through the seal with a razor blade.
Second, these seals produce a time of check to time of use
(“TOCTTOU”) vulnerability which further requires consumer
awareness and attention to detect tampering. This vulnera-
bility stems from the time gap between when a skimmer is
installed and when a person inspects the seal. The Federal
Trade Commission recommends only daily checks by pump
owners [53] but recommends consumers check seals before
starting a transaction [52]. Advice to consumers from other
organizations also suggests consumers should be looking for
these security seals [41], [28]. Daily checks by owners can
mitigate some damages, but an attacker could collect hundreds
of cards’ data at a high-trafﬁc location in 24 hours. Accord-
ingly, these indicators must target consumers, who have the
best opportunity to immediately inspect the indicators before
committing to a transaction. These seals often indicate to
consumers that an employee should be notiﬁed of tampering
as shown in Figure 8. Consequently, the deployment of low-
cost tamper-evident seals has pushed the problem of keeping
