User: I have a project on GAE wich use Google Cloud Datastore.
Of course, I have a development environment on my local machine(with local Datastore), and stage environment and production environment on the Google Cloud with two Datastores(stage & prod) for each environment.
When I run a project on my local machine NDB connect me to my local Datastore. And it's a problem because I want to connect to Google Cloud Datastore
How can I run the project on my local machine and connect it Google Cloud Datastore(stage)? 
I use Python, and run the project via: 
dev_appserver.py app.yaml
Assistant: You have to specify the path to your codebase. IF you are running the command from the same folder, use .
dev_appserver.py .
