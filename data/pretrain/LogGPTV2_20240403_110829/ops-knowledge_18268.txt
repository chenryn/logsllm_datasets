I have a project running on Google App Engine (GAE) that utilizes Google Cloud Datastore. I have set up a development environment on my local machine, which includes a local Datastore, as well as staging and production environments on Google Cloud, each with its own Datastore (staging and production).

When I run the project on my local machine, NDB (the NoSQL database client for Google Cloud Datastore) connects to my local Datastore. However, I would like to connect to the Google Cloud Datastore (specifically the staging environment) instead.

How can I run the project on my local machine and connect it to the Google Cloud Datastore (staging)?

I am using Python and running the project with the following command:
```bash
dev_appserver.py app.yaml
```

**Response:**

To connect your local development environment to the Google Cloud Datastore (staging), you need to configure the `dev_appserver.py` to use the remote Datastore. You can do this by setting the appropriate environment variables or by modifying the `app.yaml` file to point to the staging Datastore.

Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

1. **Using Environment Variables:**
   Set the `DATASTORE_DATASET` and `DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variables to specify the project ID and the Datastore host. For example:
   ```bash
   export DATASTORE_DATASET=your-project-id
   export DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST=your-staging-datastore-host
   dev_appserver.py app.yaml
   ```

2. **Modifying `app.yaml`:**
   You can also configure the `app.yaml` file to use the remote Datastore. Add the following configuration to your `app.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   env_variables:
     DATASTORE_DATASET: your-project-id
     DATASTORE_EMULATOR_HOST: your-staging-datastore-host
   ```

Make sure to replace `your-project-id` and `your-staging-datastore-host` with the actual values for your project and staging environment.

If you are running the `dev_appserver.py` from the same directory as your codebase, you can use the following command:
```bash
dev_appserver.py .
```

This will start the development server and connect it to the specified Google Cloud Datastore (staging).
