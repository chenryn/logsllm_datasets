**User:**
I have encountered numerous issues in the past while trying to install `lxml` on OS X. Does anyone have a reliable, step-by-step guide for installing `lxml` on OS X without using MacPorts or Fink? Ideally, the guide should include clear, sequential instructions for downloading and building all necessary dependencies.

**Assistant:**
I previously had `lxml` working smoothly on Snow Leopard, but after upgrading to Lion, I encountered some difficulties. To resolve this, I needed to create a symbolic link from `gcc-4.2` to `gcc`. The command `sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml` was looking for `gcc-4.2` instead of `gcc`.

To fix this, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Symbolic Link:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to create a symbolic link from `gcc-4.2` to `gcc`:
   ```sh
   sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc-4.2 /usr/bin/gcc
   ```

2. **Install `lxml`:**
   After creating the symbolic link, you can proceed with the installation of `lxml` using the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml
   ```

These steps should help you successfully install `lxml` on OS X Lion. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know!
