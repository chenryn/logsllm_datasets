User: I've tried this and run in to problems a bunch of times in the past. Does anyone have a  recipe for installing lxml on OS X without MacPorts or Fink that definitely works?
Preferably with complete 1-2-3 steps for downloading and building each of the dependencies.
Assistant: I had this working fine with Snow Lepoard but after I upgraded to Lion I had to symlink gcc-4.2 to gcc.  Running sudo env ARCHFLAGS="-arch i386 -arch x86_64" easy_install lxml was looking for gcc-4.2 instead of gcc.
