  * Electron Version: 2.0.7
  * Operating System (Platform and Version): Ubuntu 16.04
**Expected Behavior**  
The print task should be sent without showing the system dialog, and it should
print the html content.
**Actual behavior**  
it is not doing anything at all.
**To Reproduce**
    secondWindow.webContents.print({silent: true, printBackground : false, deviceName : ''},(success) => { 
        if(success){
            console.log(success);
            secondWindow = null;
         }
     });
`silent : false` option is printing the content but not calling the callback
function. i don't want the user interaction when something need to be printed.
    secondWindow.webContents.print({silent: false, printBackground : false, deviceName : ''},(success) => { 
        if(success){
            console.log(success);
            secondWindow = null;
         }
     });
