Although elected officials, as well as public safety executives, are aware of interoperability issues, the UA needs to take 
proactive steps to ensure that interoperability continues to be a political and fiscal priority.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Ensure broader participation (e.g., involve federal and tribal agencies) in the decision-making group 
• 
Document, formalize, and put into practice the necessary interoperability agreements (e.g., MOUs), and reference 
all applicable agreements in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and store them in an 
accessible format 
• 
Ensure the participation of all possible regional responders in the strategic plan 
• 
Align local, state, and federal strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Incorporate regional interoperability funding strategy into strategic plan, such as considering funding models (in 
addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning efforts 
• 
Motivate broader acceptance of communications interoperability as both a political and fiscal priority for the UA 
and at the state level

The Kansas City UA’s TICP is built on existing SOPs, including discipline-specific mutual aid channel procedures that 
have been in place for a number of years.  Kansas City officials indicated that the TICP provided a regionwide focus on 
communications interoperability SOPs.  Since the SOPs were developed and finalized shortly before the TICP 
validation exercise, the UA has begun the process of disseminating these policies to the included agencies (e.g., 
distribute SOPs to dispatch centers, make gateway SOPs available with gateways).  While some issues with SOPs (e.g.,

during the TICP validation exercise, the use of the interoperable equipment was largely successful.  Kansas City 
officials indicated that they were in the process of implementing the National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS).  The use of NIMS for command and control, including the use of the 
Communications Unit Leader, was effective at the sites where it was required during the exercise.  
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue to standardize SOPs regionwide (e.g., activation procedures) 
• 
Disseminate the SOPs (beyond the TICP) to participating agencies 
•

The Kansas City UA uses a number of different shared systems for multi-agency communications interoperability.  
Communications across these systems is achieved through the regular use of gateways and state and federal mutual aid 
channels.  Successful tactical interoperable communications was observed among responders at each of the three TICP 
validation exercise sites.  Some difficulties were encountered with the use of communications interoperability 
equipment, but in each case, personnel were able to overcome these problems.  For example, when problems occurred 
in activating a gateway at one site, agencies used radio caches to achieve communications interoperability.  In regards to 
shared channels, agencies were able to demonstrate familiarity with the use of mutual aid channels; however the After 
Action Report noted that “inconsistent naming conventions caused some confusion on the part of some of the regional 
first responders.”  Building on the TICP validation exercise, future tests should consider testing users outside of their 
existing coverage area as well as bringing in additional state, federal, and support organizations.        
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve state and federal agencies in training and exercises 
• 
Plan and train for a regionwide event that will involve disparate systems with users working outside of their 
coverage area 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The Kansas City UA has various 800 megahertz (MHz), 700 MHz, very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency 
(UHF) radio communications systems throughout the UA.  Communications interoperability is achieved through cached 
radios, gateways, shared channels, and shared systems.  The Kansas City UA is planning to establish a multiband (800 
MHz, 700 MHz, VHF, and UHF) regionwide radio communications system, called RAMBIS, to provide 
communications interoperability.  The communications system’s infrastructure will operate in simulcast mode.  The 
default configuration will allow the calling channels for 800 MHz, VHF, and UHF to be interconnected and act as 
crossband repeaters.  Similarly, in the default configuration, channels designated TAC1 and TAC2 for all bands will be 
interconnected.

The St. Louis Area regional Response System (STARRS) was formed before the Tactical Interoperable 
Communications Plan (TICP) process and includes state and federal agencies; it also works to actively 
recruit new members throughout the UA.  While STARRS appears well established with four subcommittees 
(technical, channel programming, training and exercises, and planning/TICP), steps should be taken to 
formalize the group’s authority and influence through an official charter.  Currently, individual organizations 
develop and maintain their own budgets and procure communications equipment based on agency-specific 
needs for day-to-day communications interoperability requirements.  It appears that the jurisdictions may be 
jointly funding some interoperability requirements (e.g., specialty teams, task force), but the documentation 
does not indicate whether the UA is working toward a long-term funding plan based on regional 
interoperable communications needs. The majority of the current funding is through grants.  The UA is in the 
process of developing an interoperability strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), but it is 
not yet completed.  Although the specific documentation put forth in the TICP process did not reference a 
specific working partnership across the entire UA (e.g., Missouri and Illinois), officials in the UA report that 
a healthy, cooperative environment is in place to address multistate planning.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Consider publishing a charter for the STARRS group 
• 
Review agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or 
system upgrades 
• 
Encourage planning and development of a strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP) with 
participant approval, adoption, and acceptance; align local and state strategic planning efforts to ensure 
that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
interoperability planning and sustainable funding 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official (e.g., mayor, city council member) with political 
and fiscal authority to specifically focus on interoperability

These policies and procedures were used as the basis to create the TICP.  Although the St. Louis UA 
distributed SOPs during its TICP Implementation Workshop, further steps should be taken to disseminate the 
regional communications interoperability policies and procedures to all public safety agencies.  The St. Louis 
UA has been practicing the interoperable communications aspects required by the National Incident 
Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) for more than 1 year; however, the agencies 
experienced some command and control problems during the TICP validation exercise (e.g., multiple 
command posts, improperly identified Communications Unit Leader). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Distribute regional communications interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP Implementation Workshop) 
to all stakeholders and ensure that SOPs are consistent with regional, statewide, and interstate 
communications interoperability planning efforts

The St. Louis UA appears to be capable of employing interoperable communications capabilities in the area 
(e.g., radio caches, shared channels, gateways, shared systems).  According to the After Action Report, the 
UA’s “local and regional first responders on the scene were able to communicate effectively.”  During the 
TICP validation exercise, however, there were difficulties in executing some of these capabilities.  For 
example, the participants misused shared channels assigned for other functions and the incident command 
resorted to using cellular telephones to communicate.  Additionally, the participants were not able to 
establish a gateway patch because of an audio level issue that was not able to be resolved.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Expand methods of interoperability for emergency communications (to include more than commercial 
services such as cellular telephones) 
• 
Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional communications interoperability resources to 
improve proficiency of operations (e.g., radio cache, shared channels, mobile gateway) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

The St. Louis UA is served by a mix of conventional very high frequency (VHF), ultra high frequency, and 800 
megahertz (MHz) trunked systems.  Approximately 80 percent of the users in the public safety sector operate in the 
VHF band.  The County of St. Louis uses a conventional VHF system while the City of St. Louis operates an 800 MHz 
trunked system.  St. Clair County is currently transitioning to a countywide Project 25-compliant, 800 MHz, trunked 
system.  The most commonly used method of interoperability is sharing channels in the VHF band; however, some 
agencies use console patches.  Three interoperable communications initiatives are currently underway in the St. Louis 
UA.  The first is the deployment of a “network switch” in the city of St. Louis to connect disparate systems via 
gateways.  The second initiative is to develop a high-capacity microwave backbone that will link all of the UA counties.  
The third initiative, under the DoJ 25 Cities project, is to create a permanent cross-banded system among shared VHF, 
UHF, and National Public Safety Policy Advisory Committee channels.

The National Capital Region (NCR) Urban Area (UA) includes the District of Columbia.  It also includes the 
Virginia city of Alexandria; and the Virginia counties of Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, and Prince William; 
and the Maryland counties of Montgomery and Prince George's. 
Governance: Advanced Implementation 
Interoperability in the NCR UA is overseen by a hierarchy of formalized committees, headed by the Senior 
Policy Group at the executive level.  The Washington Council of Governments’ Joint Police and Fire 
Communications Committee addresses specific technical and operational policies.  Agreements among 
agencies are largely in place and are being compiled, and steps should be taken to ensure that these 
agreements are regularly reviewed.  An established strategic plan for voice communications was developed 
and is currently being updated to incorporate wireless data communications, as well as to include additional 
state and federal agencies.  The NCR UA has demonstrated success in using funding to address regional 
communications interoperability needs, most notably through the joint acquisition and implementation of a 
cache of 1,250 NCR radios.  Given the sustained success of the UA in working together to attain 
interoperability assets through cooperated efforts, the area should consider the merits of documenting a 
regionwide funding strategy that comprehensively addresses regional interoperability fiscal needs for the 
next 3 to 5 years.   
Recommendations: 
• 
Investigate means to more formally involve federal agencies (in addition to communications working 
group membership) and define their roles and responsibilities 
• 
Establish and/or identify the UA’s systematic process to develop and review agreements (e.g., usage 
agreements, memoranda of understanding) at least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or 
upgrades   
• 
Build on the UA’s success to support statewide interoperability throughout Virginia and Maryland 
Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): Advanced Implementation 
The policies for use of the NCR UA shared systems, as well as the Metropolitan Interoperability Radio 
System (MIRS) fixed gateway system and NCR radio cache, are long established and were effectively 
documented in Section 3 of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP).  The UA used the TICP 
as an opportunity to enhance some of these policies and to disseminate them to all included agencies.  The 
UA also undertook an aggressive effort to document communications assets in the area through the use of the 
CASM tool.  National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has been in 
place for more than 1 year and is proficiently used; particularly by the fire community.  NIMS/ICS was 
effectively used during the TICP validation exercise, including a successful deployment of the 
Communications Unit and Communications Unit Leader (COML).  The COML was able to efficiently 
deploy multi-agency resources and coordinated by radio and face-to-face with command and general staff.

The area is committed to integrating the COML position into its response structure and officials have 
indicated that they hope to be actively involved in the development of this training curriculum. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage: Advanced Implementation 
The NCR UA conducts multidiscipline and multijurisdictional communications across the area on a daily 
basis.  The well-established use of their shared systems by primary first responders as well as proficiency of 
using MIRS and the regional radio cache for outside agencies was seamlessly demonstrated during the TICP 
validation exercise.  The UA specifically verified that its personnel could achieve interoperable 
communications using fixed gateways with responders from Prince George’s County, which is the only 
county not currently using a 800 megahertz (MHz) system.  Communication was also achieved with multiple 
state and federal agencies.  
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises and include 
agencies outside of the defined UA

Technology Overview    
The NCR UA has 25 separate communications systems in the area servicing public safety agencies in the District of 
Columbia, northern Virginia, and Maryland.  The District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services, all of the 
suburban northern Virginia, and Maryland public safety agencies (except those in Prince George’s County, Maryland) 
are using separate but interconnected 800 MHz Motorola SmartZone™ systems.  Regional interoperability is primarily 
achieved through the use of shared systems, fixed gateways, shared channels, talk groups, and cached radios.  The fixed 
gateways interconnect the NCR Police Mutual Aid Radio System, the Fire Mutual Aid Radio System, and National 
Public Safety Policy Advisory Committee channels (known locally as the regional Interoperability Network System).  
Mobile gateways are only used on an incident-specific basis. 
The NCR UA anticipates migrating existing radio systems to a Project 25 (P25)-compliant system in the near future.  
Alexandria and Arlington, Virginia, are expected to upgrade their existing systems to become P25-compliant, and a new 
P25-compliant radio network will be deployed in Prince George’s County, Maryland.  Other jurisdictions in the NCR 
UA will have to make similar upgrades in order to ensure effective communications are maintained throughout the area.  
In the long-term, the NCR UA is considering expanding to include the cities of Baltimore, Maryland, and Richmond, 
Virginia.  The UA expansion will require extending the capabilities of regional radio systems and interoperability 
capabilities to these new areas.

The Omaha UA appears to work very well together, although there are few formal and established processes.  
Agreements consist of a combination of formal and informal partnerships (e.g., Douglas County has an 
agreement with Washington County and its public utilities to use their system), and the governing body, as 
referenced in the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP), does not appear to have formal state 
or federal participation.  The TICP process has pointed out the need to have a strategic plan in place, and 
Omaha officials have begun this development process over the last year and a half.  Regional leaders have 
made communications interoperability a funding priority by using general funds and bonds for equipment 
and operations and maintenance activities.  Additionally, the UA maintains budgets and procures 
communications interoperability equipment taking interoperability across the tri-county area into 
consideration.  The UA is encouraged to begin considering long-term funding strategies beyond the current 
bond initiative in order to achieve the area’s interoperability objectives. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Formalize state (i.e., Nebraska Emergency Management Agency) and federal participation (e.g., Federal 
Bureau of Investigation [FBI], Department of Defense) within the UA’s communications group(s) 
•

The TICP provides the first regional communication SOPs for the Omaha UA and is built on the prior 
procedures that existed among some of the individual agencies.  Although most agencies in the UA were 
represented in the TICP, few steps appear to have been taken to disseminate these policies.  Although the 
shared system and console patch infrastructure has simplified interoperability policies (particularly if Sarpy 
joins the Douglas system), formal SOPs are still critical to successfully establish interoperable 
communications.  The Omaha UA did not consistently demonstrate SOPs during the TICP validation 
exercise (e.g., deactivation of gateway patches did not follow TICP procedures).  The Omaha UA is in the 
process of implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System 
(ICS).  In the on-going efforts to integrate these command policies, Omaha UA had some problems with
