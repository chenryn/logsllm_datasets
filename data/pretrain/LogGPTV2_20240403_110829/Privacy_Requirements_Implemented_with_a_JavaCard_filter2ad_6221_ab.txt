typical example is a one-way hash function. Once 
replaced  by  anonymous  codes, 
the  original 
nominative data are no longer recoverable. 
Inversibility:  this  is  the  case  where  it  is,  in 
practice,  impossible  to  re-identify  the  person, 
except  by  applying  an  exceptional  procedure 
restricted 
authorized  users.  This 
exceptional  procedure  must  be  done  under 
surveillance  of  a  high  trustworthy  authority  like 
the  medical  examiner,  the  inspector-doctor  or  a 
trustworthy  advisory  committee.  This  authority 
can be seen as the privacy guarantor. Actually, it is 
a  matter  of  a  pseudonymisation  according  to  the 
common criteria terminology [5].

3.3.  Privacy requirements 
At  this  stage,  the  analysis  is  carried  on  by  taking 
into account the possible attacks, the environment, etc. 
For instance, knowing that a malicious user can deduce 
confidential information by using illegitimate types of 
reasoning,  we  can  deduce  that  the  anonymization 
function should resist to attacks by inferences.  
In general, two kinds of privacy requirements must 
be studied for any anonymization system: the “linking” 
requirements and the “robustness” requirements.  
Linking allows associating (in time and in space) one 
or several pseudonyms to the same person. Linking can 
be  temporal  (e.g.,  always,  sometimes,  never)  or 
geographic (e.g., international, national, local).

function,  for  example 
the  used  cryptographic 
techniques  are  not  strong  enough.  The  inference

3.4.  Solution characterization

Once we have specified the privacy requirements, it 
is  time  to  choose  and  characterize  the  most  suitable 
solutions. In particular, we have to specify:

4. Representative scenarios 
4.1.  Medical data transmission  
The  sensitivity  of 
the 
integrity  on 
information  exchanged 
between  healthcare  providers  (e.g.,  between  biology 
laboratories and physicians) emphasizes the needs for 
confidentiality  and 
transmitted  data. 
Moreover,  it  is  necessary  that  only  the  legitimate 
addressee  should  be  allowed  to  receive  and  read  the 
transmitted data. The use of an asymmetric (or hybrid) 
cryptographic  system  seems  suitable.  The  technique 
used  should  be  reversible  (objective)  and  robust  to 
illegitimate reversion (requirement). 
4.2.  Evaluation of professional activities 
In France, for evaluation purpose, the doctors have 
to  send  data  related  to  their  activity,  to  an  authority 
called  the  “professional  unions”  (the  need).  The  first 
privacy  objective  is  to  hide  the  patient’s  and  the 
doctor’s  identities.  However,  when  the  purpose  is  to 
evaluate  the  physician’s  behavior  (to  assess  care 
quality),  it  should  be  possible  to  re-identify  the 
concerned  physician.  Our  study  of  the  French  law 
allowed  us  to  identify  the  following  anonymization 
objectives: 
- 
Inversible  anonymization  (pseudonymisation,  in 
the  sense  of  the  common  criteria  [5])  of  the 
physician’s identities: only an user duly authorized 
to  evaluate  the  physician’s  behavior  can  re-
establish the identities. 
- 
anonymization  of 
the  patient’s 
Inversible 
identifiers: only consulting doctors can reverse this 
anonymity. 
4.3.  Evaluating hospital information systems 
the  purpose 
In  order  to  evaluate  hospital  information  and 
allocate  resources  systems  while  reducing  budgetary 
inequality, some authorities (e.g., the PMSI in France) 
analyses the healthcare establishments activities. Given 
that 
is  medico-economic  (and  not 
epidemiologic), it is not necessary to know to whom a 
given  medical  information  belongs  (anonymization). 
On  the  other  hand  it  is  important  to  recognize  that 
different  data  are  related  to  the  same,  anonymous 
person  even  if  they  come  from  different  sources  at 
different times (linkability [7]). Having said that, every 
patient  must  (always)  have  the  same  irreversible, 
anonymous identifier for the PMSI.  
4.4.  Statutory notification of disease data  
Some  diseases  have  to  be  monitored,  through 
statutory notification, to evaluate the public healthcare 
policy (e.g., AIDS) or to trigger an urgent local action 
(e.g., cholera, rabies). Various needs can be identified: 
prevention,  care  providing,  epidemiological  analysis, 
etc.  The  main  objectives  are  anonymization  and 
linkability.  Furthermore,  universal  linking,  robustness 
to inversion, and robustness to inference are the main 
requirements. 
These  objectives  could  be  refined  by  taking  into 
account the purpose of use. In fact, would we like to 
globally  evaluate  the  impact  of  prevention  actions? 
Would  we  like  to  institute  a  fine  epidemiological 
surveillance  of  the  HIV  evolution,  and  to  finely 
evaluate the impact of therapeutic actions, as well as a 
follow-up of certain significant cases? 
Indeed, 
the  purpose  of  use  has 
important 
consequences on the nature of data to be collected and 
so on the privacy requirements. Currently, we identify 
the following findings related to data impoverishment, 
to reduce inference risks: 
- 
Instead  of  collecting  the  zip  code,  it  is  more 
judicious to collect a region code. 
Instead of collecting the profession, we think that 
a  simple  mention  of 
the  socio-professional 
category is sufficient. 
Instead  of  mentioning  the  country  of  origin  it  is 
sufficient to know if the HIV positive person has 
originated from a country  where the heterosexual 
transmission is predominant.

4.5. Processing of medical statistical data 
For statistical processing and scientific publications, 
not only should data be anonymized, but it also should 
be  impossible  to  re-identify  the  concerned  person. 
Indeed,  even  after  anonymization,  identities  could  be 
deduced by a malicious statistician if he could combine 
several  well-selected  queries,  and  possibly,  by 
complementing the reasoning by external information. 
The problem of statistical database inference has been 
largely  explored  in  previous  works  [6,  7].  In  some 
cases, the solution could be to exchange the attributes 
values (in databases) so that the global precision of the 
statistics  is  preserved,  while  the  precise  results  are 
distorted.  However,  the  inherent  difficulty  in  this 
solution  is  the  choice  of  values  to  be  permuted. 
Another solution could modify the results (of statistical 
requests) by adding random noise. The aim is to make 
request cross-checking more difficult. 
linkability  and  robustness 
Therefore,  the  privacy  requirements  for  statistical 
processing  could  be  the  anonymization  inversibility, 
non 
inference  are 
essential. 
4.6.  Focused epidemiological studies 
In  order  to  improve  care  quality,  it  is  sometimes 
desirable  to  re-identify  patients,  especially  in  some 
to 
then 
international 
the  disease  stage, 
genetic disease follow-up. For instance, in the case of 
the  process  starts  by 
cancer  research  protocols, 
identifying 
the  protocol 
corresponding to the patient is identified, and finally, 
according to this protocol, the patient is registered in a 
regional,  national  or 
registry.  The 
epidemiological or statistical studies of these registries 
could  bring  out  new  results  (concerning  patients 
following a  certain  protocol).  In  order to  refine  these 
studies  and  improve  the  scientific  research,  it  is 
sometimes  useful  to  re-identify  the  patients,  to  link 
some  data  already  collected  separately,  and  finally 
complement the results. We can thus conclude that this 
is  a  matter  of 
inversible  anonymization.  Only 
authorized  persons  should  be  able  to  reverse  the 
anonymity (e.g., consulting physician), and only when 
it is necessary. 
5. A systematic approach 
5.1.  General scheme 
In the previous sections, we explained our analysis 
method  and  we  applied  it  to  some  representative 
scenarios.  Now,  we  give  shape  to  our  analysis  by 
developing  a  generic  solution that  satisfies  the raised 
requirements  and  summarizes  the  six  possible  use 
cases (Figure 2).
