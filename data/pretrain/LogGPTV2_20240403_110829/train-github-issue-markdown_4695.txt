I use deno in a Monorepo project witch nodejs and browser code.
And for now,webstorm only support one typescript language server. Actually, I
did some work in babel,and now I can deliver code between node„ÄÅdeno and
brower.
And I use vscode for deno,webstorm for node and brower.
What annoying me is, if I careless touch a deno file in webstrom,it alart me
'.ts' error as you know.
Use deno and node in mix mode is the reality.
Actually,the reason I use deno is because,it is good to write TypeScript
script. And I can obtain that ability via esbuild.
I think the incompatible in typescript import syntax,is a big mistake you
should change.
deno is good,because if we make a huge program,we can use deno to isolate
something.In that scope,what is important is we can tansfer any code from deno
to node,and any code from node to deno.
In order to achieve this goal, my design(and I think is the common one) is use
node develop code.and generate deno code.(because if a problem can solve in
deno,it certainly can be solved in node,but not the other way around).
And I think it's good for deno to generate language syntax compatible design.
Meanwhile,I think npm discompatible is receivable,because this is higher than
lanuage syntax,And we can do a lot to compat that layer.
