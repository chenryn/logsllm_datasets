### Bug report
matplotlib.pyplot picture is corrupted when the picture is too wide
**Code for reproduction**
A minimum working example is here:
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    num_points = 1000
    op_norms = range(1, num_points + 1)
    op_names = ["name {}".format(p) for p in op_norms]
    for figwidth in [300, 400]:
        f = plt.figure(num=None, figsize=(figwidth, 6), facecolor='w', edgecolor='k')
        for i, op_norm in enumerate(op_norms):
            plt.semilogy(i, op_norm, "o")
        plt.xticks(np.arange(num_points), op_names, rotation=90)
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.grid(True)
        plt.savefig("wideplot_width_{}.png".format(figwidth), bbox_inches='tight')
        plt.close()```
**Expected outcome** :  
When `figwidth=300`, everything is fine; see here. However, when it is
increased to `figwidth=400`, the plot is corrupted (boarder is not complete, x
axis label not complete, dirty ink etc.); see here.

Any hint would be very much appreciated! Thanks!
