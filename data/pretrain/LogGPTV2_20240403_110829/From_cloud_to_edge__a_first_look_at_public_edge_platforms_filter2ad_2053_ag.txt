A PRICING MODEL COMPARISON
Table 7 shows a detailed comparison among the billing models of
NEP and 2 popular cloud platforms (Alibaba Cloud and Huawei
Cloud), referred to vCloud-1 and vCloud-2 in §4.5, in detail. We
focus on monthly cost, as it’s generally supported by both cloud
and edge platforms.
In NEP, the network traffic of VMs located in the same site will
be combined and charged together. The bandwidth charged by ENS
is the 95-th percentile daily peak bandwidth of the month. In other
words, NEP will first record the peak bandwidth usage per day, and
then use the 4th highest one from all the daily peak usage in this
month to generate the bill. As previously discussed, such a billing
method is less elastic as compared to cloud platforms that charge
bandwidth by its average usage per minute or even second.
