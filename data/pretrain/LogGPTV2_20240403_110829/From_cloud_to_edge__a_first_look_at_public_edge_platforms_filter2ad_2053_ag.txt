### A Pricing Model Comparison

Table 7 provides a detailed comparison of the billing models for NEP and two popular cloud platforms in China (referred to as vCloud-1 and vCloud-2 in §4.5). The focus is on monthly costs, as this is generally supported by both cloud and edge platforms.

#### Billing Models

- **NEP**:
  - **Network Traffic**: Combined and charged together for VMs located in the same site.
  - **Bandwidth Charging**: Based on the 95th percentile daily peak bandwidth of the month. This means that the highest peak bandwidth usage per day is recorded, and the 4th highest value from all daily peak usages in the month is used to generate the bill.
  - **Billing Method**: Less elastic compared to cloud platforms that charge based on average usage per minute or second.

- **Alibaba Cloud**:
  - **CPU and Memory**:
    - 2CPU + 4GB: 187 RMB/month
    - 2CPU + 8GB: 240 RMB/month
    - 2CPU + 16GB: 318 RMB/month
  - **Storage (SSD)**: 1 RMB/GB/month

- **Huawei Cloud**:
  - **CPU and Memory**:
    - 1CPU + 1GB: 32.2 RMB/month
    - 1CPU + 2GB: 72.2 RMB/month
    - 2CPU + 4GB: 152.2 RMB/month
    - 2CPU + 8GB: 251.6 RMB/month
  - **Storage (SSD)**: 0.7 RMB/GB/month

- **NEP**:
  - **CPU**: 65 RMB/CPU/month
  - **Memory**: 20 RMB/GB/month
  - **Storage (SSD)**: 0.35 RMB/GB/month
  - **Network**:
    - **Pre-reserved (fixed)**: 25–50 RMB/Mbps/month (Telecom or Unicom)
    - **On-demand, by bandwidth**:
      - 1Mbps: 23 RMB/Mbps/month
      - 2Mbps: 46 RMB/Mbps/month
      - 3Mbps: 71 RMB/Mbps/month
      - 4Mbps: 96 RMB/Mbps/month
      - 5Mbps: 125 RMB/Mbps/month
      - >5Mbps: 80 RMB/Mbps/month
    - **On-demand, by quantity**:
      - 1–5Mbps: 0.063 RMB/Mbps/hour
      - >5Mbps: 0.248 RMB/Mbps/hour
      - 0.8 RMB/GB

- **Examples**:
  - **Alibaba Cloud**:
    - 2Mbps: 46 RMB/month
    - 7Mbps: 125 + (7 - 5) * 80 = 285 RMB/month
    - 2Mbps: (24 * 30) * (2 * 0.063) = 90.72 RMB/month
    - 7Mbps: (24 * 30) * [(2 * 0.063) + (7 - 5) * 0.248] = 447.84 RMB/month
    - 1GB: 1 * 0.8 = 0.8 RMB

  - **Huawei Cloud**:
    - 2Mbps: 46 RMB/month
    - 7Mbps: 23*5 + (7 - 5) * 80 = 275 RMB/month
    - 2Mbps: (24 * 30) * (2 * 0.063) = 90.72 RMB/month
    - 7Mbps: (24 * 30) * [(5 * 0.063) + (7 - 5) * 0.25] = 586.8 RMB/month
    - 1GB: 1 * 0.8 = 0.8 RMB

- **Edge Network Bandwidth**:
  - **Guangzhou-Telecom** 2Mbps: 50 * 2 = 100 RMB/month
  - **Chengdu-Telecom** 2Mbps: 25 * 2 = 50 RMB/month
  - **Guangzhou-CMCC** 2Mbps: 30 * 2 = 60 RMB/month
  - **Chengdu-CMCC** 2Mbps: 15 * 2 = 30 RMB/month

| **Category** | **Sub-category** | **Method** | **Example** |
|--------------|------------------|------------|-------------|
| **CPU**      |                  |            |             |
| **Memory**   |                  |            |             |
| **Storage (SSD)** |              |            |             |
| **Network**  | Pre-reserved (fixed) | 25–50 RMB/Mbps/month (Telecom or Unicom) | Guangzhou-Telecom 2Mbps: 100 RMB/month |
|              | On-demand, by bandwidth | 1Mbps: 23 RMB/Mbps/month; 2Mbps: 46 RMB/Mbps/month; 3Mbps: 71 RMB/Mbps/month; 4Mbps: 96 RMB/Mbps/month; 5Mbps: 125 RMB/Mbps/month; >5Mbps: 80 RMB/Mbps/month | 2Mbps: 46 RMB/month; 7Mbps: 285 RMB/month |
|              | On-demand, by quantity | 1–5Mbps: 0.063 RMB/Mbps/hour; >5Mbps: 0.248 RMB/Mbps/hour; 0.8 RMB/GB | 2Mbps: 90.72 RMB/month; 7Mbps: 447.84 RMB/month; 1GB: 0.8 RMB |

**Note**: The price of edge network bandwidth varies across different cities and operators.
