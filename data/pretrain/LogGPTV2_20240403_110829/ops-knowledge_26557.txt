User: Is there any way to run a Python script without a command shell momentarily appearing?
Naming my files with the ".pyw" extension doesn't work.
Assistant: The simple answer is to copy the "LazyLibrarian.py" to "LazyLibraryian.pyw" and create a shortcut to Desktop.  Then put the shortcut in your startup folder.
