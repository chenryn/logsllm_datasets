Question: "In a cryptographic system, security is paramount. An encryption method is considered insecure if an adversary can easily recover the original message without knowledge of the secret key. Given this premise, which of the following reasons justify the insecurity of the Caesar cipher?"
 "A": "The Caesar cipher relies on a short fixed key space that can be exhaustively searched."
 "B": "The Caesar cipher's algorithm for encryption and decryption is not publicly known, leading to obscurity but not security."
 "C": "The Caesar cipher uses quantum-resistant algorithms that are not yet proven to be secure against classical computers."
 "D": "The Caesar cipher maintains secure communication, as long as the shift value remains undiscovered by an unauthorized party."
Answer: A
