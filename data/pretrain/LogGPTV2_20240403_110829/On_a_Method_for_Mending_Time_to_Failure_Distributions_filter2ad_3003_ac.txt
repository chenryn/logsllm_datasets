Obviously, truncating the distribution of the number of in-
herent faults scales the original mean value function (6) by
the factor (1 − exp(−ν))−1 > 1. Speciﬁcally, the expected
number of failure occurrences after an inﬁnite amount of
testing is limt→∞ µ(t) = ν/(1 − exp(−ν)), which is ex-
actly the same as the expected number of inherent faults
(19) connected to the zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
Since the transition rates and reliability functions at-
tached to the states 1, 2, ... of the counting process are not
affected by the truncation, the distributions of the times to
second, third, ... failure are still defective. In the follow-
ing section, we investigate how the defectiveness of all TTF
distributions can be mended.

number of faults remaining
From Section 4.1 we can see that the defectiveness of the
distribution of the time to ﬁrst failure in NHPP-I models is
caused by the fact that as long as no failure has occurred
- i.e., as long as the counting process resides in state 0 - it
is possible that the software does not contain any fault at
all. Truncating the Poisson distribution of N, the number of
inherent faults, ﬁxes this problem.
More generally, equation (11) tells us that the conditional
distribution of N − M(t) | M(t) = i − 1 is Poisson. The
meaning of this is as follows: The number of faults cur-
rently remaining in the software, calculated as the differ-
ence between the number of initial faults and the number of
previous failure occurrences (the actual state of the count-
ing process), follows a Poisson distribution. Since the Pois-
son distribution always assigns a non-zero probability to the
value 0, after the correction of the (i − 1)st fault there is a
chance that the software is fault-free.
Left-truncating all the conditional distributions of N |
M(t) = i−1 therefore seems to be a natural extension to the
approach employed in the last section. The zero-truncated
conditional distributions have the probability mass func-
tions

for i − 1 ≥ 0, n ≥ i. For i − 1 = 0 and t = 0, equa-
tion (22) specializes to the probability mass function of the
zero-truncated (unconditional) distribution of N, equation
(18). For i − 1 > 0, as soon as the (i − 1)st failure has
been experienced the truncated conditional probability mass
function (22) rules out the possibility that the number of in-
herent faults was merely i− 1. The reliability in the interval
(ti−1, ti−1 + x] is then given by
R(x | ti−1, M(ti−1) = i − 1)

for i − 1 ≥ 0, where the random variable W denotes

failures i − 1, reliability function (23) approaches zero for
x → ∞. Therefore, all distributions FX1(x), FX2(x), ...
are non-defective. Unlike the truncation of only the uncon-
ditional distribution of N, truncating each conditional dis-
tribution mends all TTF distributions. Moreover, since the
truncation is carried out at each state of the counting pro-
cess, the transition rates r0(t), r1(t), ... connected to equa-
tion (23) are all identical
ri−1(t) =
νg(t)
1 − exp(−ν(1 − G(t))
for i − 1 ≥ 0. The structure of the counting process related
to the family of “all-stages truncated models” is shown in
Figure 4.
This model family belongs to the class of NHPP mod-
els, because all transition rates are identical. The number
of failure occurrences at time t, M(t), follows a Poisson
distribution with expected value

(24)
Since µ(t) → ∞ for t → ∞, the models are NHPP-II
models. This result is not unexpected. The zero-truncated
conditional probability mass functions (22) ensure that re-
gardless the previous number of failure occurrences there is
always at least one undiscovered fault remaining in the soft-
ware. Due to the non-defectiveness of G(t) each fault will
eventually lead to a failure. Consequently, there is no upper
bound for the expected number of failures to be experienced
during inﬁnite testing.
From the unifying mean value function (15) we can de-
rive the family of all-stages truncated models by plugging
in the generic non-defective distribution function of the time
to ﬁrst failure FX1(t) = [1−exp(−νG(t))]/[1−exp(−ν)].
The structure of this distribution is similar to the one of the
coverage function in the software reliability models with
a time-varying testing-effort, cf. equation (8). However,
while the latter one is defective, our time to ﬁrst failure
distribution is non-defective because of the normalizing de-
nominator.

In Section 2 we have seen that the distribution of the time
to the ith failure is defective if equation (2) holds, i.e., if
the area below the transition rate ri−1(t) is ﬁnite. Focus-
ing on NHPP models, our investigations in Section 3 have
shown that due to the equality of all transition rates and
the failure intensity the defectiveness of the TTF distribu-
tions is linked to the asymptotic behavior of the mean value
function: All TTF distributions are defective for NHPP-
I models, while they are all proper for NHPP-II models.
In this section we will brieﬂy discuss the question which
other sub-classes of CTMC models may feature defective
TTF distributions. Our classiﬁcation criteria are the time-
dependence and/or state-dependence of the transition rates
on the one hand and the fact whether a model belongs to
the ﬁnite-failures category or the inﬁnite-failures category
on the other hand.
(Models in which the transition rates
are neither time- nor state-dependent are too simplistic to
model software reliability growth, and we therefore omit
them.) In Figure 5 sub-classes containing models with at
least one (non-trivially) defective distribution are shaded in
gray. Moreover, examples of models are listed in italics.
The class of NHPP models, covered in Sections 3 and 4, is
shown on the left-hand side of the ﬁgure.
Let us proceed with those models for which the transi-
tion rates are not merely time-dependent (like for the NHPP
models), but also state-dependent. Here the asymptotic be-
havior of the mean value function does not determine the
defectiveness of the TTF distributions.
First of all, while some TTF distributions of ﬁnite fail-
ures category models belonging to this class may be defec-
tive, this is not necessarily true for all TTF distributions.
An example of such models is the family of ﬁrst-stage trun-
cated models derived in Section 4.1.
Moreover, it is even possible that all TTF distributions of
a ﬁnite failures category model are proper, as the example of
the Littlewood model [14] shows. This model proposes that
the software initially contains u0 faults, where u0 is a ﬁxed
but unknown integer value. All of these faults have time-
independent hazard rates that are independently sampled
from the same Gamma(α, β) distribution. These assump-
tions result in the time- and state-dependent transition rates
ri−1(t) = (u0 − (i − 1))α/(β + t) for 0 ≤ i − 1 ≤ u0 − 1.
For these transition rates, equation (2) is not satisﬁed, and
therefore the distributions of X1, X2, ..., Xu0 are proper.
The transition rate ru0(t) is constant at zero, which means
that the entire probability mass of the distribution of Xu0+1
is attached to inﬁnity. However this defectiveness is trivial
and can already be seen from the structure of the counting
process: The Littlewood model is one of those models for
which the CTMC representing the counting process termi-
nates at the absorbing state u0.
Time- and state-dependent CTMC models of the inﬁnite
failures category are not very common. However, it is not
difﬁcult to construct examples in order to prove that such
models may or may not feature defective distributions, just
like those models of the ﬁnite failures category. “Inverting”
the structure of the ﬁrst-stage truncated models in Figure 3
by setting the transition rate out of state 0 to r0(t) = νg(t)
and all other transition rates to r1(t) = r2(t) = ... =
νg(t)/{1 − exp[−ν(1 − G(t))]}, where G(t) is again a
non-defective distribution function and g(t) is its derivative,
results in a model in which both the failure intensity

Figure 5. Classiﬁcation of CTMC software re-

are scaled versions of the respective functions attached to
the family of all-stages truncated models. Obviously, µ(t)
approaches inﬁnity for t → ∞. Moreover, our previous
analyses have shown that the TTF distribution related to the
transition rate r0(t) is defective, while this is not the case for
all other TTF distributions. Therefore, this generic “all-but-
ﬁrst-stage truncated model” belongs to the inﬁnite failures
category and contains exactly one defective distribution.

distributions are proper can be derived from the Musa-
Okumoto model by setting r0(t) = λ0θ/(λ0θt+1). The re-
liability in the interval (0, x] implied by this transition rate,
R(x | 0, M(0) = 0) = (λ0θx + 1)−1, approaches zero
for x → ∞ . Therefore, the distribution of the time to ﬁrst
failure is not defective. All other transition rates are kept
identical to the failure intensity (13) of the original model.
Since the Musa-Okumoto model is an NHPP-II model, the
TTF distributions related to these transition rates are proper
as well. For the modiﬁed model the failure intensity be-
