User: I am trying to write a python script to rotate screen in Windows.
I have clues of doing it with Win32api.
What are the other possibilities or commands to achieve so(Win32api included).
Assistant: If you have the rotate shortcut active in windows (CTRL+ALT+ARROW KEY) you can use pyautogui.hotkey function.
