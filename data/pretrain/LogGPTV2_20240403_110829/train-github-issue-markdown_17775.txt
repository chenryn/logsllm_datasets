##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
ec2_asg
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.0.0.2
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Running from: Ubuntu Linux  
Managing: Ubuntu Linux
##### SUMMARY
We (seeming randomly) get cases where we'll do a blue/green deploy using the
"ec2_asg" module and have an async task waiting for the module to return a
result. The task that waits for the result never gets the async notification
and therefore fails despite the deploy succeeding.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
  * Create a new launch config (our new "blue" deploy)
  * Run the "ec2_asg" task with the new launch config (with async set and "poll: 0")
  * Have a task later in the playbook waiting on the result
  * Confirm that the deploy succeeds in AWS (new instances brought up, old ones terminated)
  * See that the "async_status" job never gets the notification that the deploy has happened

        wait_timeout: 2400

      async: 1000
      poll: 0
      register: int_asg_sleeper
      - name: 'int ASG - check on fire and forget task'
        async_status: jid={{ int_asg_sleeper.ansible_job_id }}
        register: int_asg_job_result
        until: int_asg_job_result.finished
        retries: 60
        delay: 15
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Expected that when the deploy succeeds and the "old" instances are terminated,
the Async job gets the message and reports success.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
It appears that the "file" mechanism which Python/Ansible use for checking on
the status of background jobs fails and the file is never populated, despite
the job finishing. Therefore the job polling the file times out eventually.
