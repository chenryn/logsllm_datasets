the future, we would like to consider ImageNet scale secure train-
ing. Even though we can run inference on commodity machines,
for training we would need protocols that can leverage specialized
compute and networking hardware. Like all prior work on 2PC for
secure DNN inference, CrypTFlow2 only considers semi-honest
adversaries. In the future, we would like to consider malicious ad-
versaries. Another future direction is to help the server in hiding
ùêπ from the client when computing a classifier ùêπ(ùë•, ùë§). Like [43],
SCIHE can hide some aspects of ùêπ: the filter sizes, the strides, and
whether a layer is convolutional or fully connected. Thus, SCIHE
hides more information than OT-based tools [48] but reveals more
information than FHE-based tools [13, 31]. We are exploring ap-
proaches to hide more information about ùêπ while incurring minimal
overhead.
