User: How to use Prometheus to monitor application performance under microservice architecture
Assistant: To use Prometheus to monitor application performance under the microservice architecture, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Deploy Prometheus: Prometheus can be deployed through Docker, binary files, Helm chart, etc. 2. Add Prometheus exporter on the server side: Prometheus exporter is a component used to expose the performance indicators of various applications. Exporters can be added to the code, or third-party libraries can be used. 3. Configure Prometheus targets: In the Prometheus configuration file, configure the address and indicators of the exporter. 4. Create a Prometheus indicator query statement: According to actual needs, use the PromQL query language to write a query statement to query various indicators. 5. Optional: Visual display using Grafana: You can use Grafana to connect to Prometheus, and use Grafana to visually display the query results of Prometheus. 6. Configure alarm rules to monitor abnormal conditions of the application. In general, to use Prometheus to monitor application performance under the microservice architecture, you need to add an exporter on the server side, configure Prometheus targets, write query statements, and finally use Grafana for visual display.
