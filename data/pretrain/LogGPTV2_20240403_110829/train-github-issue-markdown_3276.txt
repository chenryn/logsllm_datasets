  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
I have found a very similar issue: #7012 but that talks about the handler
being detached AFTER closing popover. Our popovers do not even open, yet they
hook into the onScroll event.
## Expected Behavior
I expect Popover to not touch scroll events until it is actually on screen.
## Current Behavior
Every Popover element (including the ones in IconMenu) hooks into the onScroll
event. If there are many of these present, the handling of the scroll events
is impacted.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Go to http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/card
  2. Check Chrome's Dev Tools > Elements > Event Listeners > scroll  
You will see there is one scroll listener  
This is your baseline
  3. Now click on the Popover menu item to see the example Popover page
  4. Check Chrome's Dev Tools > Elements > Event Listeners > scroll  
You will see FOUR listeners.  
One listener was registered for each Popover on the screen, even though they
are not visible at the moment
This means Popovers are registering even if they are not active at all.
## Context
We are (ab)using Popovers in our app, using hundreds/thousands of IconMenu
elements within a table. Each of these contains a Popover and each Popover
hooks into onScroll. This leads to bad performance when the table size grows.
