User: Please write a Python script to monitor the performance indicators of the MySQL database.
Assistant: The following is a basic Python script for monitoring the performance indicators of the MySQL database: ``` import mysql.connector import time # connect to the MySQL database mydb = mysql.connector.connect( host="localhost", user="yourusername", password="yourpassword", database="mydatabase" ) # Create a cursor object mycursor = mydb.cursor() # Loop monitor performance indicators while True: # Query the current number of connections mycursor.execute("SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Threads_connected'") result = mycursor.fetchone() connections = result[1] # Query the number of currently active requests mycursor.execute("SHOW PROCESSLIST") result = mycursor.fetchall() requests = len(result) # Query the current database usage mycursor. execute("SELECT table_schema AS 'Database', ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS 'Size (MB)' FROM information_schema.tables GROUP BY table_schema;") result = mycursor.fetchall() for row in result: print(row) # Wait for 5 seconds time.sleep(5) # Close the database connection mydb.close() ``` This script queries three performance indicators: the number of current connections, the number of currently active requests, and Current database usage. The script will continuously query these indicators in a loop, and then output the results every 5 seconds. If you need to monitor other indicators, you can add corresponding SQL query statements to the script. It should be noted that for some sensitive indicators, you may need to configure the corresponding MySQL permissions to query.
