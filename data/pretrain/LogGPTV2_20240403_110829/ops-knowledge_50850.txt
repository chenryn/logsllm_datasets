User: I am looking for a simple Python webserver that is easy to kill from within code. Right now, I'm playing with Bottle, but I can't find any way at all to kill it in code. If you know how to kill Bottle (in code, no Ctrl+C) that would be super, but I'll take anything that's Python, simple, and killable.
Assistant: Raise exeption and handle it in main or use sys.exit
