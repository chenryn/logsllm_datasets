**What happened** :  
I think it is independence the environment, so I did not describe them.
If I create a type of nodePort service , kube-proxy will use net.Listen to
openLocalPort in every node.  
If the service have no endpoint (means pod have not started, or start
failed.), the client like curl http://xxxx:xxx will hang. It will not timeout.
I had tried it just use net.Listen to create a TCP Listener, it can be
reproduce.
**What you expected to happen** :  
I expected it will timeout, if the endpoints is not ready.
I think it will infect the third-part to access the service that the endpoint
have not ready.  
The third-part client will hang.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
  1. Create an nodePort service without any endpoint.
  2. curl http://node-ip:nodeport. The curl will always hang.
**Anything else do we need to know** :
