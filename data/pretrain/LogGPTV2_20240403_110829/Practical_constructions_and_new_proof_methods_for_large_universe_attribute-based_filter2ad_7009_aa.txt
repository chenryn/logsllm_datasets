ABSTRACT
We propose two large universe Attribute-Based Encryption
constructions. In a large universe ABE system any string
can be used as an attribute and attributes need not be
enumerated at system setup. Our ﬁrst construction estab-
lishes a novel large universe Ciphertext-Policy ABE scheme
on prime order bilinear groups, while the second achieves
a signiﬁcant eﬃciency improvement over the large universe
Key-Policy ABE system of Lewko-Waters and Lewko. Both
schemes are selectively secure in the standard model under
two “q-type” assumptions similar to ones used in prior works.
Our work brings back “program and cancel” techniques to
this problem and aims in providing practical large universe
ABE implementations.
To showcase the eﬃciency improvements over prior con-
structions, we provide implementations and benchmarks of
our schemes in Charm; a programming environment for rapid
prototyping of cryptographic primitives. We compare them
to implementations of the only three published constructions
that oﬀer unbounded ABE in the standard model.

INTRODUCTION
Traditionally, public key encryption schemes provided any
user with the ability to share data with another speciﬁc
user in a private manner. However, in many applications
we would like to have the additional capability to encrypt
data for a set of users according to a speciﬁc policy on their
credentials. For example, one might want to store data in a
public server such that only parties with credentials of spe-
ciﬁc forms are able to decrypt.
Instead of encrypting the
data once for each party it would be beneﬁcial to be able
to encrypt only once for all desired parties. This encryp-
tion notion, called Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), was
introduced by Sahai and Waters [36]. In this setting, each
user possesses a set of attributes/credentials and a secret
key that corresponds to these credentials. The encrypting
party can deﬁne any Boolean formula on the possible at-
tributes and a user can decrypt if and only if his attribute
set satisﬁes the Boolean formula.
Several attribute-based constructions have been presented
since then (see related work below). A common classiﬁca-
tion property is whether a system is a “small universe” or
“large universe” constructions. In “small universe” construc-
tions the size of the attribute space is polynomially bounded
in the security parameter and the attributes were ﬁxed at
setup. Moreover, the size of the public parameters grew
linearly with the number of attributes. In “large universe”
constructions, on the other hand, the size of the attribute
universe can be exponentially large, which is a desirable fea-
ture.
Achieving the large universe property can be challenging.
Diﬀerent works either imposed restrictions on the expres-
siveness of the policies or were proved secure in the random
oracle model. For example, in [20] a bound n was ﬁxed at
setup on the number of attributes that could be used while
encrypting a message. For constructions that had no bounds
on the expressiveness of policies and constant sized public
parameters, the random oracle security model was used.
The above restrictions place undesirable burdens on the
deployment of ABE schemes. If the designer of the system
desires the beneﬁts of avoiding the random oracle heuristic,
he has to pick a speciﬁc bound for the expressiveness of the
system at the setup time; either the size of the attribute uni-
verse or the bound on the policies. If the bound is too small,
the system might exhaust its functionality and will have to
463be completely rebuilt. For example, consider the design of
a framework that allows Attribute-Based Encryption in a
huge multinational company and suppose that, as this com-
pany expands, a large number of new attributes have to be
added to the system. If this number exceeds the bound set
during the initial deployment of the system, then the com-
pany would have to re-deploy the (expanded) system and
possibly re-encrypt all its data spending a huge amount of
expenses. On the other hand, if the bound chosen is too big,
the increased size of the public parameters will impose an
unnecessary eﬃciency burden on all operations.
The ﬁrst large-universe constructions in the standard mo-
del were presented in the recent work of Lewko and Waters
[25]. They presented the ﬁrst large universe KP-ABE con-
struction, secure in the standard model. The system was
proved selectively secure under static assumptions. The au-
thors of [25] refer to their construction as an “unbounded”
scheme, in the sense that the public parameters do not im-
pose additional limitations on the functionality of the sys-
tems. Their scheme is indeed large universe, since the size of
the attribute universe is exponentially large in the security
parameter.
The authors utilized the dual system framework on com-
posite order groups to prove security. While this framework
is highly useful for the proofs, the actual constructions re-
quire use of bilinear groups of large composite order. As a
result, these schemes sustain a signiﬁcant eﬃciency overhead
in comparison to prime order ABE constructions. In a recent
result [22] building on [30, 32, 23, 17], one can actually “em-
ulate” the eﬀects of the composite order groups by creating
special subspaces of vectors, called dual vector spaces intro-
duced by Okamoto and Takashima, and construct a large
universe KP-ABE system on prime order groups. This im-
proves the eﬃciency of the original construction, but there
is still a signiﬁcant performance penalty due to the required
size of the vectors.
In a subsequent work by Okamoto and Takashima [33], an-
other unbounded KP-ABE scheme and the ﬁrst unbounded
CP-ABE scheme are presented. Both of them are the ﬁrst
fully secure unbounded ABE schemes in the standard model
and utilize the dual vector spaces framework. Their sys-
tems are unbounded, since the size of the public parame-
ters is constant and does not impose any limitations on the
size of the attribute universe. However, the traditional no-
tion of “large”-“small” universe is not applicable, since each
“attribute” can take one or more diﬀerent values from an
exponential-sized space, instead of “present”/“not present”.
The total number of these sub-universes should be polyno-
mial in the security parameter and the maximum number
of times each sub-universe can be used in a policy is a pa-
rameter ﬁxed at the setup of the system. As this bound is
increased, the overall eﬃciency of the system is impaired.
In our benchmarks, we implement the most eﬃcient “basic
version” of their constructions where this parameter is equal
to 1, i.e. each sub-universe can be present only once in each
policy.
Goals and Contributions We present new construc-
tions and proof techniques for Large Universe ABE in the
standard model. Departing from the above recent trends,
our constructions are proved selectively secure using what is
know as partitioning style techniques.
We believe that this is an interesting avenue to explore
for two reasons. First, by considering selective model of
security we are able to get more eﬃcient and more practical
constructions. While full security is the strongest notion
of security, we believe selective is still a meaningful notion
and can be a reasonable trade oﬀ for performance in some
circumstances. In addition, new partitioning proofs can give
diﬀerent and new insights into the security or the style of a
construction.
Second, Lewko and Waters [26] recently showed a surpris-
ing connection between Dual System Encryption and older
selective proofs. Prior fully secure ABE systems [23] re-
quired an additional (relative to selective schemes) limit t on
the number of times an attribute could be used in a formula.
The public parameters and ciphertext size for KP-ABE (key
size for CP-ABE) grew proportionally to the bound t. Lewko
and Waters showed that through a new “delayed parameter”
variant of Dual System Encryption this limit could be done
away with. An integral part of their proof was that it lever-
aged older “program and cancel” style techniques. Given
this recent work, a reasonable conclusion is that developing
selectively secure proofs might typically become a ﬁrst step
to developing full security. (We note that the large universe
construction of [25] was only proved selectively secure.)
We aim to get practical large-universe ABE schemes
by adapting and expanding the system from [25] into the
prime order setting. In proving security we go back to more
traditional “program and cancel” techniques instead of the
dual system framework. We present two practical large uni-
verse ABE constructions (one CP-ABE and one KP-ABE)
in prime order bilinear groups both selectively secure in the
standard model under two diﬀerent q-type assumptions. Our
three main objectives in this work were large universe con-
structions, eﬃciency, and security in the standard model.
Both schemes support a “large universe” attribute space and
their public parameters consist of a constant number of
group elements. No bounds or other restrictions are im-
posed on the monotonic Boolean formulas or the attribute
sets used by the algorithms of the schemes; thus eliminat-
ing the need for design decisions at setup. The eﬃciency
objective refrained us from using composite order groups or
dual pairing vector spaces, while to achieve security in the
standard model we relied on non static (q-type) assumptions
and selective notions. These assumptions are non static in
the sense that a polynomial number of terms is given to the
adversary and therefore they are intuitively stronger than
the static ones. However, the polynomial number of terms
gives the ability to the simulator of the proof to embed the
additional entropy in the constant number of public param-
eters. We showcase diﬀerent techniques for harnessing the
power of these assumptions to achieve our large universe
constructions. Finally, we demonstrate the eﬃciency of our
constructions by implementing our schemes. We compare
performance results to other ABE schemes in prime order
groups.
Our Techniques The techniques used to achieve our
goals and prove the security of our schemes fall in the cate-
gory of partitioning methodologies. In this setting the sim-
ulator of the reduction sets up the public parameters of the
systems in such a way that the set of the possible poli-
cies (for KP-ABE) or the powerset of the attribute universe
(for CP-ABE) is partitioned in two disjoint sets. One for
which he can create the secret keys and answer the attack-
ers’ queries, and one for which this is not possible, where the
challenge query should belong. Since we are dealing with se-
464lective security notions, the simulator knows in advance the
required challenge set and therefore the suitable partition.
However due to the fact that we are aiming for large uni-
verse ABE, which implies constant size public parameters,
the simulator has to embed a polynomial amount of “chal-
lenge information” in them. This is achieved by utilizing the
non static power of our assumptions. Namely, the assump-
tions’ “size” depends on the size of the declared challenge
query. The additional terms available to the simulator allow
him to create all the necessary terms for the reduction.
Both our schemes work in a “layered” fashion in order
to encrypt information securely and being able to decrypt.
In the KP-ABE construction, which is simpler and directly
inspired by the composite order construction of [25], two
“layers” are employed: the “secret sharing” layer and the “at-
tribute layer”. The ﬁrst layer is responsible for the sharing
of the master secret key during the key generation algorithm
and the storing of the blinding factor randomness during the
encryption algorithm. The “attribute layer” holds informa-
tion about the attributes used in both key generation and
encryption phases. A “binder term” is utilized to connect the
two layers in a secure way. In the CP-ABE construction the
situation is slightly more complicated due to the fact that
the policies are applied on the ciphertext side. As a result,
the “sharing” is applied to the blinding factor randomness
and not on the master secret key. Therefore, an additional
“binder term” in the public parameters is being used to al-
low correct decryption using the master secret key. As we
will see, the assumptions and the corresponding reductions
follow closely this “layer” intuition.
Finally, we mention that both constructions use the “in-
dividual randomness” technique from [25] in the “attribute
layer” to achieve the large universe functionality. The com-
ponent for each attribute is masked by a diﬀerent random-
ness and as a result no restrictions are imposed on the poli-
cies or the attributes, since each component is individually
randomized.
1.1 Related Work
Attribute-Based Encryption was introduced by Sahai and
Waters [36]. The reﬁnement of the two notions was given
in [20] and many CP-ABE and KP-ABE selectively secure
constructions followed [6, 15, 19, 34, 35, 43]. Most of them
work for monotonic access structures with the exception
of the schemes by Ostrovsky, Sahai, and Waters [34], who
showed how to realize negation by incorporating speciﬁc re-
vocation schemes into the GPSW construction. Fully se-
cure constructions in the standard model were ﬁrst provided
by Okamoto and Takashima [32] and Lewko, Okamoto, Sa-
hai, Takashima, and Waters [23]. The ﬁrst large universe
KP-ABE construction in the standard model was given in
[25] (composite order groups) and the ﬁrst fully secure un-
bounded constructions were given in [33]. Okamoto and
Takashima initiated the dual pairing vector space frame-
work in various works [30, 31, 32], which lead to the ﬁrst
large universe KP-ABE construction in prime order group
groups by Lewko [22]. Parameterized (non static) assump-
tions were introduced in [7] and used in several subsequent
works [18, 43]. The problem of an environment with mul-
tiple central authorities in ABE was considered in [13, 14,
24], while several authors have presented schemes that do
not address the problem of collusion resistance [40, 28, 11,
2, 3, 4].
