**Chinese version:**
This vulnerability is similar to several XXE vulnerabilities submitted by
@Matthias Kaiser before, and `EJBTaglibDescriptor` should be the one that he
missed. You can refer to the previous XXE [analysis](https://paper.seebug.org/
906/). I and @Badcode decompile all the WebLogic Jar packages, searched and
matched the EJBTaglibDescriptor class according to the characteristics of
several previous XXE vulnerabilities. This class will also perform XML parsing
when deserializing.
Oracle released the October patch, see the link for details
(https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html)
### Analysis Environment
  * Windows 10
  * WebLogic 10.3.6.0.190716(Installed the July 2019 patch)
  * Jdk160_29（JDK version that comes with WebLogic 10.3.6.0.190716）
### Vulnerability Analysis
`weblogic.jar!\weblogic\servlet\ejb2jsp\dd\EJBTaglibDescriptor.class` , this
class inherits from `java\io\Externalizable`
Therefore, the subclass rewrite `writeExternal` and `readExternal` are
automatically called during serialization and deserialization.
Let's take a look at the logic of `writeExternal` and `readExternal`，
In `readExternal`, use `ObjectIutput.readUTF` to read the String data in the
deserialized data, and then call the `load` method.
In the `load` method, using `DocumentBuilder.parse` to parse the XML data
passed in the deserialization, so there may be an XXE vulnerability here.
In `writeExternal`, the `toString` method of its own is called, in which its
own `toXML` method is called.
`toXML` method should be to convert `this.beans` to the corresponding xml
data. It seems that constructing the payload have a little trouble, but the
serialization operation is controllable by the attacker, so we can directly
modify the logic of `writeExternal` to generate malicious serialized data:
### Vulnerability Recurrence
  1. Rewrite function `writeExternal` in `EJBTaglibDescriptor` to generate payload
  2. Send payload to server
Received my.dtd request and win.ini data on our HTTP server and FTP server.
  3. We can see the error message on the server with the latest patch in July.
