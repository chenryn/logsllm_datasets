### Description
It would be nice to add a comment when pausing a DAG, so that others looking
at a DAG and expecting it to be unpaused, can understand why it may have been
paused and who it has been paused by.
### Use case/motivation
I want to have the ability to share with others, the reason I am pausing a
DAG. This could be done via a modal pop-up prompting the user for a comment
(while maintaining the option to leave it empty), which will be displayed as a
banner near the top of a DAG page.
