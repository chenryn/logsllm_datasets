### Description
It would be beneficial to include a comment when pausing a DAG. This feature would allow other users, who might expect the DAG to be active, to understand the reason for the pause and identify who initiated it.

### Use Case/Motivation
I would like to have the ability to provide a reason for pausing a DAG, which can be shared with other team members. This could be implemented through a modal pop-up that prompts the user to enter a comment (while still allowing the option to leave it blank). The comment would then be displayed as a banner at the top of the DAG's page.
