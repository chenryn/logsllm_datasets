non-popular channels with few tens of concurrent users also
show the batch departure patterns.
Third, the user arrival is much less time-correlated than
the departure. Unlike Figure 13(b), the arrival patterns
show much less variations. This indicates that the number
of users watching a channel ramps up gradually over time,
while it drops sharply at batch departure processes.
5.3.2 Inter arrival and departure times
Finally, we look at the inter arrival and departure times
to identify the arrival and departure processes. Figure 14
shows the cumulative distribution of inter arrival and de-
parture times for channel A, which is one of the top-ranked
channels. The granularity of channel changes are 1 second in
our trace and we assume arrivals are uniformly distributed
within each second. The median inter arrival time is 0.07
seconds, indicating that 1/0.07 = 14 users join channel A
per second. The median inter departure time is also 0.07
seconds; users leave and join channel A at the same rate.
The arrival rate varies over time and the arrival process is
not stationary over the course of a day. The maximum in-
ter arrival time is 14 seconds, which corresponds to the low
usage hours. The maximum inter departure time is 700 sec-
onds. While we do not show here, we ﬁnd that both arrival
and departure processes at short timescales (less than 1 mil-
lisecond) are exponentially distributed. This observation is
consistent with previous studies on arrival processes of live
streaming servers [33, 39, 40].

5.4 Summary
In this section, we have identiﬁed how people ﬁnd content
across three diﬀerent angles. Understanding this mechanism
is important because any user activity to search for content,
imposes some load in the network. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd
that most of the channel changes do not lead to viewing
activity, which highlights the fact that the network infras-
tructure could be overloaded with superﬂuous short channel
surﬁng events. Our ﬁnding has major implications to IPTV
networks, as opposed to traditional broadcast TV networks
(e.g., cable and satellite TV). This is because in traditional
broadcast networks, all channels are delivered to the end
users and the surﬁng activities of users do not create addi-
tional load on the network.
We have also characterized the arrival and departure pat-
terns of users of individual channels, where we have found
time-correlated arrival and batch-like departure processes.
Such dynamics in user churn put signiﬁcant challenges to
the design of P2P-based IPTV systems as they need to deal
with drastic changes of the viewer population in a short pe-
riod of time.
6. DISCUSSION
Our observations about IPTV workloads can help re-
searchers to understand the user and the content charac-
teristics of TV and video streaming systems. Our ﬁndings
also oﬀer useful insights for the designers of existing and
future video applications. For example:
(cid:129) Channel selection process: Most channel changes are
related to channel surﬁng and are short-intervaled. There-
fore assisting users in channel selection is crucial to the qual-
ity of their viewing experience. In current IPTV and Inter-
net video systems, electronic program guides (EPG) and
metadata about channels such as tags and descriptions pro-
vide users with useful additional information about content.
It is also important to make new content quickly available
at the time of channel switching. This is more challeng-
ing for high-bandwidth video and TV streaming, especially
in P2P distribution systems. For instance, the state of the
art P2P Internet TV service Joost takes up to 5 seconds to
switch channels. Another popular service, PPLive, buﬀers
for 10 to 15 seconds before its playout [34]. Infrastructure-
based Telco’s IPTV systems guarantee a switching delay of
less than 1 second. However, this is not satisfactory as a
100-200 ms switching delay is considered “instantaneous” by
viewers.
Our results about linear channel changes suggest that pro-
viding the channel numbers sorted for each user by either
channel popularity for that user or dynamically based on
current program popularity might reduce unnecessary chan-
nel changes. Our ﬁndings on the periodic popularity dy-
namics further suggest that a more dynamic re-numbering
following time of day trends will be needed.
(cid:129) Popularity and program ratings: An accurate mea-
sure of popularity is useful for TV viewers, content produc-
ers, and content distributors. The popular Nielsen ratings
are usually aggregated over a long period of time and delayed
a few hours to a day. With IPTV, we can get the instan-
taneous popularity information of programs and monitor its
evolution closely. Having access to such realtime informa-
tion is useful for TV viewers in deciding what program to
watch.
(cid:129) Rewind and on-demand features: Traditional and the
ﬁrst generation IPTV systems are live. Now TV is trans-
forming itself to an interactive on-demand service and users
are allowed to rewind back to any point back in time and
watch TV at the time they want. Our ﬁndings on user ar-
rival and departure patterns demonstrate that users’ arrivals
to programs are less correlated than departures. Also users
take a temporary leave during commercials and come back
late, missing out on the beginning part of the programs they
watch. For example, when watching a soccer game, users
may miss a goal that happens immediately after a half-time
break.
These behaviors call for supporting IPTV rewind func-
tionalities, which have recently been oﬀered by various op-
erators under the name of “Past TV.” However, as opposed
to DVRs which provide access to scenes stored locally, Past
TV provides access to any scene regardless of whether the
set-top-box was tuned into that channel or not. Under stan-
dard IPTV architectures, all rewind load would be directed
to video servers. However, the strong group membership
amongst users watching the same program reﬂects the po-
tential for a peer-assisted IPTV rewind service, where late-
comers in the program can easily ﬁnd available seed peers.
In our earlier work [32], we studied the eﬃcacy of such peer-
assisted rewind service where users joining a channel always
rewind back to the beginning of the on-going program. We
found that with an assistance of a P2P system, the video
server load dramatically reduces to 5%.
7. RELATED WORK
Understanding TV viewing habits in the old days relied on
specialized monitoring boxes or phone surveys. Due to the
diﬃculty of conducting a large-scale survey, the monitoring
was limited to a subset of the TV viewing population. A
representative example is the Nielsen Media Research [5]
that provides a wide set of statistics on TV viewing and
program ratings.
Viewing behaviors in Internet streaming have received re-
cent attention. Sripanidkulchai et al. [33] studied the In-
ternet radio and video streaming workloads of 5,000 users
in Akamai, the largest content distribution network in the
world. They observed a diurnal pattern in traﬃc and a Zipf-
like popularity of live content. They found a heavy-tailed
session duration and explained that short median session
durations (less than 10 seconds) are likely due to channel
surﬁng events. Our results are consistent with these earlier
ﬁndings, but they are based on a speciﬁc IPTV system and
the number of users is more than two orders of magnitude
larger.
There are peer-to-peer Internet video streaming systems
such as Joost, Zatoo, and BBC’s iPlayer, that provide TV
like viewing experience. Hei et al. [34] studied the packet
traces from PPLive, a P2P-based IPTV system, and showed
that peers join and leave at a higher rate at peak times.
They observed a periodic (every 2 hour) batch user de-
parture pattern for a popular movie channel. We also ob-
served batch like departure pattern, however, at a smaller
time scales (tens of minutes). This diﬀerence may be due
to the channel switching delay of the two systems. Un-
like our IPTV system, P2P-based IPTV has long start-
up delays that range from tens of seconds to several min-
utes [34]. Due to the long playback lags users may be-
have somewhat diﬀerently from other TV viewing environ-
ments, for instance, users may be reluctant to switch chan-
nels during commercials. Other studies similarly analyzed
the workloads and traﬃc characteristic of P2P-based IPTV
systems [41, 42]. These results complement ours; while our
system is infrastructure-based, understanding both systems
provide a comprehensive view of IPTV workloads.
In our
earlier work [32], we looked into the potential for peer-
assisted IPTV system.
Many previous studies have measured network properties
of video-on-demand systems [16, 17, 34, 43, 44]. Cherkasova
and Gupta [43] analyzed the enterprise media server work-
loads from Hewlett-Packard Corporation; Yu et al. [16] mea-
sured a commercial video system in China, PowerInfo; and
Cheng et al.
[17] analyzed the workloads of their high-
bandwidth P2P-based VoD system. They discuss the popu-
larity distribution of videos, viewing session characteristics,
and their implications on designing eﬃcient distribution ar-
chitectures. Although our paper uses similar measurement
techniques, the network environment we study is diﬀerent
as the viewing in live IPTV is not on-demand, but largely
aﬀected by the broadcaster’s schedule, and ours is the ﬁrst
study is to use large-scale real traces from a commercial
telco’s IPTV service.
8. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Television has long been a dominant and pervasive mass
media and its viewing behavior has many important im-
plications on the video distribution networks and systems.
With the increasing popularity of Internet services, multi-
media consumption patterns could change signiﬁcantly over
the coming years. However, as a recent report on the com-
munications market stresses [22], the average time spent on
watching television remains signiﬁcant despite the uptake
of broadband services. In fact, we expect TV to remain a
crucial mass media in the future as it integrates many inno-
vations in the Internet and as well as in the mobile space.
In this paper, we presented the ﬁrst large-scale measure-
ment study of a telco’s IPTV system. We characterized sev-
eral properties of viewing sessions, channel popularity dy-
namics, content locality, and channel switching behaviors.
Our data analysis on the workloads of a live IPTV system
brings values in understanding how the underlying networks
and systems can better adapt to future challenges in Internet
TV distribution.
There are several directions that we wish to pursue as fu-
ture work. The ﬁrst is to understand the implications of
the workloads on the system design. Our trace showed that
over 60% of a user’s channel changes are related to channel
surﬁng. We are interested in designing a system that can
reduce the number of channels users need to sample before
ﬁnding something that interests them. Second, we would
like to study the proﬁles of individual users. While we lim-
ited our study to understanding the behavior of an average
populace, future studies can focus on classifying users into
diﬀerent proﬁles (based on the time they watch TV, channels
they watch, etc). Answering these questions are promising in
the context of IPTV recommendation systems [45]. Finally,
it would be very useful to develop a model that captures
user switching behaviors and content popularity dynamics.
The designers of future streaming systems can utilize such
realistic models to test and assess their systems.
