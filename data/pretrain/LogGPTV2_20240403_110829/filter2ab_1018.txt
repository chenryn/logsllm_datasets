### Title: Black Hat EU-20: Manufacturing Hardware Implants from Idea to Mass Production: A Hacker's Journey

#### Abstract:
This presentation aims to inspire and guide hackers who have always wanted to share their innovative hacking devices with the community but were unsure how to navigate the complexities of Research and Development (R&D), Quality Assurance (QA), and mass production. In this talk, I will share the complete lifecycle of two hacking tools I developed: the WHID Injector and WHID Elite. From their initial concept to their final release, I will discuss the challenges, setbacks, and lessons learned along the way.

#### Why This Topic Is Interesting:
The R&D processes for both the WHID Injector and WHID Elite were entirely self-funded, without any reliance on crowdsourcing. Additionally, the sale of these devices does not generate any profit for me. This project is a labor of love, driven by my passion for hobby and my commitment to giving back to the InfoSec community. By sharing my experiences, I hope to encourage others to embark on similar not-for-profit ventures. The presentation will also highlight examples of other hackers who, inspired by my journey, have started their own non-profit projects.

#### Key Takeaways:
- **Inspiration and Motivation:** Learn how to turn your hacking ideas into tangible, functional devices.
- **Practical Insights:** Gain valuable insights into the R&D, QA, and mass production processes.
- **Community Impact:** Understand the importance of contributing to the InfoSec community without seeking financial gain.
- **Real-World Examples:** Discover how other hackers have been inspired to start their own not-for-profit projects.

Join me as I share the journey of bringing the WHID Injector and WHID Elite from idea to reality, and be inspired to create and share your own innovative hacking tools.
