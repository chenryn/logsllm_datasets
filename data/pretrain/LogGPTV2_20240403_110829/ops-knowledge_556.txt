I recently acquired a MacBook and have been thoroughly enjoying coding on the go, particularly with Python. However, I would like to distribute my final product as an executable file to friends who use Windows. I understand that Py2Exe can help me achieve this, but I'm uncertain about Python's portability across different operating systems. Additionally, I am using the PyGame library. Can anyone provide some advice?

In my experience, creating executables for Python applications using tools such as Py2Exe, cx_Freeze, or others has often led to numerous bugs and errors, especially with the `atexit` module. As an alternative, I find it much more convenient to simply include the Python distribution along with your application. This approach not only simplifies the process but also offers several advantages.

When you create an executable for a Python application, you essentially bundle the core of the Python installation, including only the modules your application uses. However, even with this selective inclusion, the size of your application can grow from a few kilobytes (KB) to over 15 megabytes (MB) due to the added Python installation. By contrast, if you distribute the Python interpreter along with your application, each individual script will remain small, typically just a few KB. Moreover, you won't need to re-bundle the executable every time you make minor changes to your code.

Installing Python and PyGame is straightforward on most platforms. On Windows, it is as simple as installing any other application. In Linux, you can use package managers like Synaptic, which makes the process extremely easy. On macOS, things are a bit more complex. macOS comes pre-installed with Python, and Snow Leopard, for example, includes Python 2.6.1. If your application requires a later version of Python, you will need to instruct users to set the "Open With" option in the "Get Info" window to use your version of Python instead of the default one. This process is not difficult and can be completed in a few seconds, even by less experienced users.

Python is highly portable, and PyGame applications can run unchanged on the three major operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux. They can even run on mobile and portable devices. If you need to develop cross-platform applications, Python is an excellent choice and is highly recommended.
