### IPDWMCorr (FS2) TP
- **Expected IPDWMCorr TP:**
  - 400
  - 200

- **Max Uniform Perturbation (ms):**
  - 600
  - 800
  - 1000
  - 1200
  - 1400

### Figure 8: Correlation True Positive Rates under Random Timing Perturbations
- With a maximum 100 ms random timing perturbation, the true positive rate of IPD-based correlation drops to 45.5%. For a 200 ms maximum delay, the rate drops to 21.5%.
- In contrast, the proposed watermark-based correlation of the flows in FS1 and FS2 achieves virtually a 100% true positive rate up to a maximum 600 ms random timing perturbation.
- With a maximum 1000 ms timing perturbation, the true positive rates of watermark-based correlation for FS1 and FS2 are 84.2% and 97.32%, respectively.
- The measured watermark-based correlation true positive rates are well approximated by the estimated values based on the watermark detection rate model (equation (13)). Specifically, the true positive rate measurements of FS2 are almost identical to the estimated values at all perturbation levels.

### 8.2 Correlation False Positive Experiment
- As explained, there is a non-zero probability that an un-watermarked flow will exhibit the randomly chosen watermark, leading to a correlation collision or false positive.
- According to our correlation collision model (equation (14)), the collision rate is determined by the number of watermark bits \( l \) and the Hamming distance threshold \( h \).

#### Experimental Investigation
- We experimentally investigated the following, for varying values of the Hamming distance threshold \( h \):
  1. Collision rates between 10,000 to 1,000,000 randomly generated 24-bit watermarks.
  2. Collision rates between a given 24-bit watermark and 10,000 to 1,000,000 randomly generated (using tcplib) telnet flows.

### Figure 9: Correlation False Positive (Collision) Rate vs Hamming Distance Threshold \( h \)
- For each data point in Figure 9, 100 experiments were run, and the average is shown.
- The measured collision rates and expected values are very close, validating our model.
- The results show that the collision rate can be controlled to a low value by appropriate selection of the Hamming distance threshold.

### 8.3 Tradeoff between Watermark Detection Rate and Redundancy Number
- Equation (12) provides the quantitative tradeoff between the expected watermark bit robustness and redundancy number \( m \).

### Figure 7: Comparison of 288 Selected IPDs before and after Watermark Embedding
- **Experiment:**
  1. We used an existing, passive timing-based correlation method called IPD-Based Correlation [16] to correlate each flow in FS1 with the same flow after inter-packet delays have been randomly perturbed.
  2. A random 24-bit watermark was embedded into each flow of FS1 and FS2, with a redundancy number \( m = 12 \) and a quantization step size \( s = 400 \) ms for each watermark bit.
  3. The embedding of the 24-bit watermark required 300 packets to be selected, with 288 packets delayed to embed the watermark.
  4. The packet timing of the watermarked flows of FS1 and FS2 was then randomly perturbed.
  5. It is considered a true positive of watermark-based correlation if the embedded watermark can be detected in the timing-perturbed watermarked flows, with a Hamming distance threshold \( h = 5 \).
  6. Finally, we calculated the expected detection rate from equations (12) and (13) under various maximum delays of the random timing perturbation.

- Each data point in Figure 8 shows the average of 100 separate experiments measuring the true positive rates of IPD-based Correlation and watermark-based correlation on FS1 and FS2.
- The results clearly indicate that IPD-based correlation is vulnerable to even moderate random timing perturbation. Without timing perturbation, IPD-based correlation successfully correlates 93.4% of the SSH flows of FS1. However, with a 100 ms maximum delay, the true positive rate drops to 45.5%.

### Figure 9: Correlation False Positive (Collision) Rate vs Hamming Distance Threshold \( h \)
- With a given watermark bit robustness \( p \), equation (13) gives us the expected watermark detection rate.
- To verify the validity and accuracy of our models of watermark bit robustness and watermark detection rate, we embedded a random 24-bit watermark into each flow in FS1 and FS2 for different redundancy numbers \( m = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 \).
- The quantization step \( s \) was set to 400 ms for each watermark bit. The watermarked flows were then perturbed with a 1000 ms maximum random delay.
- Finally, we measured the watermark detection rate of the perturbed, watermarked flows.

### Figure 10: Watermark Detection Rates vs Redundancy Number \( m \)
- Figure 10 shows the average of 100 experiments for the measured watermark detection rates of FS1 and the average of 10 experiments for the measured watermark detection rates of FS2.
- Also shown is the expected detection rate derived from equations (12) and (13) for the various values of the redundancy number \( m \).
- The detection rates of FS2 are very close to the expected values, while the detection rates of FS1 are similar to but lower than the expected values. These results validate our models of watermark bit robustness and watermark detection rate.

### 9. Conclusions and Future Work
- Tracing attackers through stepping stones is a challenging problem, as they use a variety of countermeasures to evade correlation of connections across stepping stones. In particular, random timing perturbation by the attacker greatly reduces the effectiveness of passive, timing-based correlation techniques.
- We presented an active timing-based approach to deal with random timing perturbation. By embedding a watermark into the packet timing with sufficient redundancy, we can correlate in a way that is probabilistically robust against random timing perturbations.
- Our experiments show that watermark-based correlation is substantially more effective than passive, timing-based correlation in the presence of random timing perturbations.
- For independent and identically distributed (iid) random delays added by the attacker, our model reveals a surprising theoretical result: the proposed watermark-based correlation scheme can, with arbitrarily small average adjustment of inter-packet timing, achieve arbitrarily close to 100% watermark detection (true positive) rate and arbitrarily close to 0% collision (false positive) probability at the same time against arbitrarily large (but bounded) iid random timing perturbations, as long as there are enough packets in the flow to be watermarked.
- We also developed models of the tradeoff between the watermark detection (or true positive) rate and watermark collision (or false positive) rate. Our experimental results validate the accuracy of these tradeoff models, making them of practical value in optimizing the overall effectiveness of watermark-based correlation in real-world situations.
- Future research work includes how to effectively correlate connections when the attacker:
  1. Reorders the packets.
  2. Drops or retransmits some packets.
  3. Adds padding packets ("chaff" [5]).

### 11. Appendix
- **Proof of Theorem 1:**
  - Given any \( \text{ipd} > 0 \), we can find unique \( a \geq 0 \) and \( -\frac{s}{2} < b \leq \frac{s}{2} \) such that \( \text{ipd} = a \times s + b \). Assume \( \text{round}(\frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2}) = i \). By definition of round(x), we have \( \frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2} \in (i - \frac{1}{2}, i + \frac{1}{2}] \). That is, \( i - 1 < \frac{\text{ipd}}{s} \leq i \) or \( (i - 1) \times s < \text{ipd} \leq i \times s \). Replace \( i \) with \( \text{round}(\frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2}) \), we have \( \text{round}(\frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2}) \times s - s < \text{ipd} \leq \text{round}(\frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2}) \times s \).
  - By (4) we have:
    \[
    e(\text{ipd}, w, s) = [q(\text{ipd} + \frac{s}{2}, s) + (w - (q(\text{ipd} + \frac{s}{2}, s) \mod 2 + 2) \mod 2)] \times s
    \]
    \[
    \geq q(\text{ipd} + \frac{s}{2}, s) \times s = \text{round}(\frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2}) \times s \geq \text{ipd}
    \]
    \[
    \text{and}
    \]
    \[
    e(\text{ipd}, w, s) = [q(\text{ipd} + \frac{s}{2}, s) + (w - (q(\text{ipd} + \frac{s}{2}, s) \mod 2 + 2) \mod 2)] \times s
    \]
    \[
    \leq [q(\text{ipd} + \frac{s}{2}, s) + 1] \times s = \text{round}(\frac{\text{ipd}}{s} + \frac{1}{2}) \times s + s < \text{ipd} + 2s
    \]
  - Therefore, \( 0 \leq e(\text{ipd}, w, s) - \text{ipd} < 2s \).
