true  positive  rates  of  watermark-based  correlation  for  FS1  and 
FS2 are 84.2% and 97.32%, respectively. It can be seen that the 
measured watermark-based correlation true positive rates are well 
approximated  by  the  estimated  values,  based  on  the  watermark 
detection  rate  model  (equation  (13)).  In  particular,  the  true 
positive  rate  measurements  of  FS2  are  almost  identical  to  the 
estimated values at all perturbation levels.  
8.2  Correlation False Positive Experiment 
As explained above, there is a non-zero probability that an un-
watermarked  flow  will  happen  to  exhibit  the  randomly  chosen 
watermark. This case is considered a correlation collision, or false 
positive.    According  to  our  correlation  collision  model (14), the 
collision rate is determined by the number of watermark bits l and 
the Hamming distance threshold h. 
We  therefore  experimentally  investigated  the  following,  for 
varying values of the Hamming distance threshold h:

Figure 9 shows the results.  For each data point in Figure 9, 100 
experiments were run, and the average is shown. 
The  measured  collision  rates  and  expected  values  are  very 
close, validating our model.  In addition, the results show that the 
collision  rate  can  be  controlled  to  a  low  value  by  appropriate 
selection of the Hamming distance threshold. 
8.3  Tradeoff between Watermark Detection 
Rate and Redundancy Number 
Equation  (12)  gives  us  the  quantitative  tradeoff  between  the 
expected  watermark  bit  robustness  and  redundancy  number  m.

following experiment. First, we used an existing, passive timing-
based  correlation  method  called  IPD-Based  Correlation[16]  to 
correlate  each  flow  in  FS1  with  the  same  flow,  after  the 
interpacket delays of the flow have been randomly perturbed. If 
the  flow  and  the  perturbed  flow  are  reported  correlated,  it  is 
considered a true positive (TP) of the correlation in the presence 
of  timing  perturbation.  Second,  we  embedded  a  random  24-bit 
watermark  into  each  flow  of  FS1  and  FS2,  with  redundancy 
number  m=12,  and  quantization  step  size  s=400ms  for  each 
watermark bit. The embedding of the 24-bit watermark required 
300  packets  to  be  selected;  288  packets  were  delayed  to  embed 
the  watermark.  Figure  7  shows  the  effect  of  the  watermark 
embedding,  and  illustrates  that  the  embedding  is  far  from  being 
obvious. Third, we randomly perturbed the packet timing of the 
watermarked  flows  of  FS1  and  FS2.  It  is  considered  a  true 
positive  of  watermark-based  correlation

Finally, we calculated the expected detection rate from equations

timing perturbation.  
Each data point in Figure 8 shows the average of 100 separate 
experiments  measuring  the  true  positive  rates  of  IPD-based

With a given watermark bit robustness p, equation (13) gives us 
the expected watermark detection rate. 
To verify the validity and accuracy of our models of watermark 
bit  robustness  and  watermark  detection  rate,  we  embedded  a 
random  24-bit  watermark  into  each  flow  in  FS1  and  FS2,  for

Figure  10  shows  the  average  of  100  experiments  for  the 
measured watermark detection rates of FS1, and the average of 10 
experiments for the measured watermark detection rates of FS2. 
Also shown is the expected detection rate derived from equations 
(12) and (13) for the various values of the redundancy number m. 
The detection rates of FS2 are very close to the expected values, 
while the detection rates of FS1 are similar to but lower than the 
expected values. These results validate our models of watermark 
bit robustness and watermark detection rate.

We  presented  an  active  timing-based  approach  to  deal  with 
random timing perturbation. By embedding a watermark into the 
packet  timing,  with  sufficient  redundancy  we  can  correlate  in  a 
way  that  is  probabilistically  robust  against  random  timing 
perturbations.  Our  experiments  show 
that  watermark-based 
correlation  is  substantially  more  effective  than  passive,  timing-
based correlation in the presence of random timing perturbations. 
For independent and identically distributed (iid) random delays 
added  by  the  attacker,  our  model  reveals  a  rather  surprising 
theoretical result on the limits of watermark-based correlation: the 
proposed  watermark  based  correlation  scheme  can,  with 
arbitrarily  small  average  adjustment  of  inter-packet  timing, 
achieve  arbitrarily  close  to  100%  watermark  detection  (true 
positive) rate and arbitrarily close to 0% collision (false positive) 
probability  at  the  same  time  against  arbitrarily  large  (but 
bounded)  independent  and  identically  distributed  (iid)  random

We  also  developed  models  of  the  tradeoff  between  the 
watermark  detection  (or  true  positive)  rate  and  watermark 
collision (or false positive) rate. Our experimental results validate 
the accuracy of these tradeoff models. Thus our tradeoff models 
are  of  practical  value  in  optimizing  the  overall  effectiveness  of 
watermark-based correlation in real world situations. 
Future  research  work  includes  how  to  effectively  correlate 
connections  when  the  attacker  1)  reorders  the  packets;  2) 
drops/retransmits  some  packets;  or,  3)  adds  padding  packets

11.  APPENDIX 
Proof of Theorem 1 
Given  any  ipd>0,  we  can  find  unique  a≥0  and  –s/20  and  s>0,  assume  round(ipd/s+1/2)=i,  by 
definition of round(x), we have ipd/s+1/2 ∈(i-1/2, i+1/2]. That is 
i-1<ipd/s≤i  or  (i-1)×s<ipd≤i×s.  Replace  i  with  round(ipd/s+1/2), 
we have round(ipd/s+1/2)×s-s<ipd≤round(ipd/s+1/2)×s. 
By (4) we have  
e(ipd, w, s), s) 
= [q((ipd+s/2), s)+(w-(q((ipd+s/2), s) mod 2+2) mod 2]×s 
≥ q((ipd+s/2), s)×s 
= round(ipd/s+1/2)×s 
≥ ipd 
and 
e(ipd, w, s), s) 
= [q((ipd+s/2), s)+(w-(q((ipd+ s/2), s) mod 2+2) mod 2]×s 
≤ [q((ipd+s/2), s)+1]×s 
= round(ipd/s+1/2)×s+s 
< ipd+2s 
Therefore, 0≤e(ipd, w, s)-ipd<2s.
