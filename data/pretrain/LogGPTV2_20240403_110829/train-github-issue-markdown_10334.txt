**Issue Description:**

Hello Team,

We are encountering an issue where Playwright is unable to locate the specified element in a Selenium Grid Docker setup. The problem occurs after navigation, and it results in a `TimeoutError`.

**Error Details:**

```plaintext
com.microsoft.playwright.TimeoutError: 
Error {  
  message='Timeout 60000ms exceeded.  
  =========================== logs ===========================  
  waiting for locator("xpath=//input[@id='UserName']")
  # name='TimeoutError'  
  stack='TimeoutError: Timeout 60000ms exceeded.  
  =========================== logs ===========================  
  waiting for locator("xpath=//input[@id='UserName']")
      at ProgressController.run (/tmp/playwright-java-11238511618491153829/package/lib/server/progress.js:88:26)
      at Frame.fill (/tmp/playwright-java-11238511618491153829/package/lib/server/frames.js:1047:23)
      at FrameDispatcher.fill (/tmp/playwright-java-11238511618491153829/package/lib/server/dispatchers/frameDispatcher.js:163:30)

}
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The test runs successfully in local environments and local Selenium Grid setups.
- Page load and explicit waits have been implemented.

Please let us know if you need any further information or if there are any specific configurations we should check.
