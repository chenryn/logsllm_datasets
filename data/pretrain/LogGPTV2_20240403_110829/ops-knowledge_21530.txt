I'm encountering an issue with Visual Studio while setting up my project to use PlatformIO in the Python environment. When I run the command `os.system("platformio init")`, it fails and produces the following error:

```
'platformio' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

I have already added the PlatformIO folder to the Python library search paths, but this has not resolved the issue. It's worth noting that I do not have Python or PlatformIO installed on the local machine; they are only available within the Python Tools for Visual Studio (PTVS). The Python program runs fine without being installed locally, and I would prefer to keep it that way if possible.

**Update:**
After adding the PATH environment variable, all I needed to do was close and reopen Visual Studio. For anyone experiencing the same issue, simply closing and reopening the application might resolve the problem.
