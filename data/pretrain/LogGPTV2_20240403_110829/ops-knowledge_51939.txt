Assistant: This log chunk is related to various software components and processes running on the system. It includes kernel messages related to Thunderbolt, AirPort, and Wi-Fi connections, as well as messages from mDNSResponder, symptomsd, configd, com.apple.cts, com.apple.WebKit.WebContent, corecaptured, and QQ. The log shows that the system is transitioning between different states, such as normal sleep and wake on scan offload, and that various processes are being deallocated, registered, and updated.
