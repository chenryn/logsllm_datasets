User: I have a local path like C:\Users\some_user\Desktop\some_folder\attachments\20150210115. I need to generate network path with python like \\PC_NAME\C:\Users\some_user\Desktop\some_folder\attachments\20150210115 or something like this to get this folder from other windows pc. Is it possible to do in python automatically or I need just to hardcode local path replacing pc name and other staff?
UPDATE
Sorry, I not so familiar with Windows path as I live in Linux. I just need to generate network path for local path and send it to other device.
Assistant: Having thought about the problem itself: No, it's not possible to do this in any general way, because there's absolutely no reason why C:\path\to\file should correspond to \\PCNAME\C:\path\to\file; that requires that the folder C:\ has the share name C:, which might be canonical on windows machines, but not fixed. In fact, normal users don't even get to read the full list of shares of a windows computer including their local bindings.
EDIT: as the others pointed out, there are ways to get your machines network name, but you'll have to build the network path with that manually, and I think your question was about automatically matching a file to it's windows share "URL".
