User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where are windows 10 defender offline scan logs/results? I can't find any events or log files,
are there such records somewhere or WD reports only if it finds something?

Windows 10 pro,
drive is encrypted with bitlocker (might affects somehow?)

Assistant: Windows Defender adds entries to the Event Viewer in the following location:

Event Viewer >> Applications and Services Logs >> Microsoft >> Windows >> Windows Defender >> Operational


Where you'll see:
Windows Defender scan has started. (Event ID 1000)
Windows Defender scan has finished. (Event ID 1001)
Windows Defender signature version has been updated. (2000)
