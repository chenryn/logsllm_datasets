I am currently using Ubuntu 12.04 and was following the installation instructions from tensorflow.org. However, after downloading TensorFlow, I encountered the following error:

```
Downloading tensorflow-0.10.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl (36.6Mb): 36.6Mb downloaded
Running setup.py egg_info for package from https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.10.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

----------------------------------------
Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1 in /tmp/pip-uIJFE4-build/

Could you please help me resolve this issue?
