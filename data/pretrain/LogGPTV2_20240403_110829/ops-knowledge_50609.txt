User: How to achieve a highly available network architecture? What are the commonly used high-availability technologies?
Assistant: Achieving a highly available network architecture usually requires the use of multiple nodes to improve system stability and availability. Commonly used high-availability technologies include: 1. Load balancing technology: By distributing traffic to multiple servers, the processing capacity of the server is improved and performance. Common load balancing techniques include hardware load balancers and software load balancers. 2. Data redundancy technology: By duplicating data to multiple nodes, it can ensure data integrity and availability even if a node fails. Common data redundancy techniques include backup, mirroring, and replicas. 3. High-availability cluster technology: By forming multiple servers into a cluster, automatic failover and load balancing are realized to ensure the continuity and stability of services. Common high-availability cluster technologies include Pacemaker, Keepalived, corosync, etc. 4. Dual-machine hot backup technology: by using two servers, one of which provides normal services and the other serves as a backup. When the primary node fails, the backup node will automatically switch to the primary node to ensure service continuity and stability. 5. Virtualization technology: By using virtual machines, services are deployed to multiple virtual machines to achieve fault isolation and load balancing. Common virtualization technologies include VMware, Hyper-V, and KVM. 6. DNS resolution technology: By mapping multiple IP addresses to a domain name, it realizes DNS load balancing and failover, improving system stability and availability. Common DNS resolution technologies include Round-Robin DNS and DNS Failover. 7. CDN technology: through the use of multiple nodes distributed in different geographical locations, the distribution and acceleration of content can be realized, and the response speed and stability of the service can be improved. Common CDN technologies include Akamai, Cloudflare, etc.
