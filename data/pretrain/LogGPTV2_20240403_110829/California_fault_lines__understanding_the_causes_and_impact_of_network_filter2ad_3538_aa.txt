## Abstract
Network component failures are a significant yet poorly understood factor affecting end-to-end service availability. This paper addresses key questions about the frequency, duration, causes, and impact of such failures. Traditionally, answering these questions has required expensive, dedicated instrumentation. We propose an alternative approach that leverages existing, low-cost data sources within modern network environments. Our methodology combines structured (router configurations and syslogs) and semi-structured (email logs) data to reconstruct a detailed history of failure events. We apply this technique to over five years of data from a large regional network with more than 200 routers, making it one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind.

## 1. Introduction
Modern enterprises rely on uninterrupted network services. However, achieving high availability is challenging because it requires understanding and accommodating the failure properties of network components. Networks, in particular, have been identified as a leading cause of service disruptions, exhibiting complex failure modes. Detailed analysis of network failures is often impractical due to the high cost and operational complexity of traditional measurement methods. 

To address this, we present a cost-effective method for extracting necessary data from commonly available sources in production networks. Specifically, we use router configuration files, syslog archives, and operational mailing list announcements to reconstruct historical network failure events. Router configurations provide static topology information, while syslogs capture dynamic state changes. Email logs offer additional context, such as the causes of failures. By combining these sources, we analyze five years of archival data from the CENIC network, a large-scale IP network serving California's public education and research institutions.

Our main contributions include:
- A methodology for integrating router configurations, syslogs, and human-generated logs to derive a comprehensive failure history.
- A detailed analysis of over five years of data from a large-scale network.

## 2. Related Work
Network designers have long grappled with various types of failures, but most measurements have been edge-based, providing an incomplete picture. Direct measurement studies, though valuable, have typically required extensive and costly instrumentation. Our approach uses frequently available implicit data sources, such as router configurations, email archives, and syslog records, to systematically identify and characterize network failures.

## 3. Data Sources
### 3.1 The CENIC Network
CENIC (Corporation for Education Network Initiatives in California) operates a statewide optical backbone network, providing Internet access to California's public education and research institutions. The network includes three major components:
- **Digital California (DC) Network (AS 2152):** Provides Internet connectivity to universities, community colleges, and K-12 schools. At the end of 2009, it consisted of 53 core routers and 178 links, using IS-IS for intra-domain routing.
- **High-Performance Research (HPR) Network (AS 2153):** Interconnects major research institutions at 10 Gb/s, consisting of six routers and seven logical links.
- **Customer-Premises Equipment (CPE) Network:** Manages equipment for smaller customers, including 102 CPE routers and 223 links.

### 3.2 Historical Data
Our study uses three forms of log information from the CENIC network, covering the period from late 2004 to the end of 2009:
- **Equipment Configuration Files:** RANCID, an open-source system, tracks changes to router configurations, providing 41,867 revisions.
- **Syslog Archives:** Capture a wide range of events, including link status changes.
- **Operational Mailing List Announcements:** Provide context and details on failure causes and responses.

## 4. Methodology
We describe our methodology for combining router configurations, syslogs, and email logs to reconstruct a detailed history of network failure events. This includes parsing and correlating data from different sources to infer failure causes and validate results against independent data sets.

## 5. Validation Methods
We validate our reconstructed failure log using three independent sources of network failure data:
- Active probes from the CAIDA Skitter/Ark effort
- BGP logs from the Route Views Project
- Administrative announcements from CENIC operators

## 6. Analysis
We present a detailed analysis of failure duration, causes, and impact, confirming widely held beliefs and revealing new insights, such as the relative importance of planned maintenance versus unplanned failures and the role of third-party telco providers in flapping episodes.

## 7. Conclusion
In summary, our work provides a novel, cost-effective approach to understanding network failures by leveraging existing data sources. We contribute a robust methodology and a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale network, offering valuable insights into the causes and impacts of network failures.
