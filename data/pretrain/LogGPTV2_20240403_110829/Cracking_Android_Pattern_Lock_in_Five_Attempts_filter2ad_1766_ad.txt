Intuitively, the more connected dots (SP ), line segments
(LP ), intersections (IP ) and overlapping line segments (OP )
that a pattern has, the more complex it is. For example, the
patterns shown in Figure 13 (c) use all the nine dots of the grid,
and have at least seven line segments and three intersections.
Base on the complexity score, we divide the collected
patterns into three complexity categories: simple, median and
complex. A simple pattern has a score of less than 19, a median
complex pattern has a score between 19 and 33, and a complex
pattern must have a score greater than 33. This classiﬁcation
gives us roughly 40 patterns per category. Figure 13 gives
some examples for each category while Figure 15 shows the
distribution of these patterns according to their complexity
scores. Based on this deﬁnition, the most complex pattern on
a 3× 3 grid has a score of 46.8 (see Figure 14). The complex
scores of the patterns we collected range from 6.4 to 46.8.
C. Video Recording and Preprocessing
User Participation We recruited ten postgraduate students
(ﬁve male and ﬁve female students) from Northwest University
to reproduce the 120 patterns (collected from users) and the
60 most complex patterns (see Section VI-A) on three target

our participants.
mobile phones: a Xiaomi MI4, a Huawei Honor7 and a
Samsung Note4. Table II lists the screen size for each target
mobile phone.
Recording Devices We used three smartphones for video
recording: an Apple iPhone4S, a Xiaomi MI4 and a Meizu2.
Each mobile phone was used to record 40 patterns with
a 1080p HD resolution of 30 FPS under different settings
described as follows.
Video Recording Setup By default, we used the Android 3×
3 native pattern grid, but we evaluated our approach using
other pattern grids with different sizes in Section VI-G. We
recorded each pattern under three ﬁlming angles, 45, 90 and
135 degrees, by placing the camera on the left-front, front,
and right-front of the target device respectively. By default,
the video was recorded indoor during daytime under a natural
lighting condition. In Section VI-D we evaluated our approach
under different lighting conditions both indoor and outdoor. By
default, videos were recorded at a distance of 2 meters from
the target device and we evaluated the impact of the ﬁlming
distance in Section VI-G.
Video Filming Before recording, our participants were given
the opportunity to practice a pattern several times, so that
they can draw the pattern at their natural speed. On average,
this practice session took 10 trails per user per pattern. When
drawing the pattern, some participants sat, while others stood,
some hold the device by hands, while others placed it on a
table. Each pattern was drawn on three target devices and
recorded under three ﬁlming angles. Thus, for the 120 patterns
collected from users, we recorded 1,080 videos in total.
Video Preprocessing For each video stream, we used the
algorithm described in Section IV-A to cut out
the video
segment of the unlocking process. We left around 200 to 300
milliseconds of the video segment before and after the pattern
unlocking process. To track the ﬁngertip locations, we used
Windows Movie Maker to highlight two areas of interest on
the ﬁrst frame of the video segment: one area surrounds the
ﬁngertip, and the other contains an edge of the phone (see
Section IV-B2).
Implementation Our prototyped attacking system built upon
a TLD library [14] in Matlab. The developed software ran on
an Intel Core i5 PC with 8GB RAM. The operating system is
Windows 10. Our implementation can be ported onto Android
or Apple iOS systems, which is our future work. On our
evaluation platform, our software takes less than 30 seconds
to process a video to produce candidate patterns.
Figure 16. For each pattern category, the ﬁgure shows the success rate using
no more than 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 attempts.
VI. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section, we ﬁrst present the overall success rate
for cracking the 120 patterns collected from our participants
plus the top 60 most complex patterns on a 3× 3 pattern grid.
Our results show that our approach can successfully crack over
95% of the patterns using no more than ﬁve attempts. We then
analyze how the success rate is affected by the ﬁlming distance,
ﬁlming angles and camera shake. Finally, we demonstrate that
direct observations lead to poor performance before evaluating
our approach on alternative pattern grids.
A. Overall Success Rate
Result 1: We can successfully crack over 95% of the patterns
in ﬁve attempts and complex patterns are less secure compared
to simple patterns under our attack.
In this experiment, videos were recorded from a distance of
2 meters away from the target device. This mimics a scenario
where the adversary sits at the next table to the user in a public
space (e.g. a restaurant). The smartphones used for ﬁlming in
this experiment were hand-held. Figure 16 shows the success
rate for cracking different types of patterns within 1, 2, 3, 4
and 5 attempts. For all the patterns used in this evaluation, our
approach does not generate more than ﬁve candidate patterns.
For complex patterns, we are able to crack all except one (with
a 97.5% success rate) in the ﬁrst attempt. For simple and
median patterns, the success rate increases with more tries.
In one attempt, we are able to successfully crack 60% and
87.5% of the simple and median patterns respectively. With
two attempts, the success rate increases to 87.5%, and 95% for
simple and median patterns respectively. Using ﬁve attempts,
we are able to crack all simple patterns and all but one median
patterns. The reason that we failed on one median and one
complex patterns is because of some blur motions of the video
footage (probably caused by the video compressing algorithm),
which leads to many tracking failures. But we are able to crack
the same pattern using a video ﬁlmed by a different device. It
is important to note that the native Android system allows up
to ﬁve failed tries before locking the device [11]. This means,
in practice, our approach is able to successfully crack most
locking patterns.
Another interesting observation is that in contrast to many
people’s intuition, complex patterns do not provide stronger
protection under our attack – as can be seen by the fact
that most of the complex patterns can be cracked in one
attempt. This is because although complex patterns can better
protect
the user against direct observation techniques like
shoulder surﬁng [21], their unique graphical structures help

leading to a deteriorative
performance in identifying candidate patterns. This can be seen
from Figure 18 where the quality of tracking clearly decreases
when the ﬁlming distance is greater than 3 meters. Nonethe-
less, our approach can achieve a high success rate when the
ﬁlming distance is within 2.5 meters. Such a distance allows an
attacker to record the video without raising suspicions in many
day-to-day scenarios (some of these are depicted in Figure 1).
We also evaluated our approach on videos ﬁlmed using a
entry-level single-lens reﬂex (SLR) camera, Nikon D90, with
a low-end 105mm lens. The SLR camera was placed from a
distance of 9 meters away from the target device. For this set
of videos, we are able to achieve the same performance when
compared to using videos ﬁlmed by a mobile phone camera
with a 2-meter ﬁlming distance. The further ﬁlming distance
is largely due to better video quality brought by the advanced
SLR camera and the lens. Therefore, in practice, an attacker
can also use a professional video recording device to launch
the attack from a further distance.
C. Impact of Camera Shake
Result 3: Our method can tolerate a certain degree of camera
shake in the hand-held mode.
In this experiment, we used an IPhone4S smartphone to
record how a pattern is drawn on a Huawei Honor7 phone. This
experiment was carried out under three settings: ﬁxed, hand-
held and shaky, where the ﬁlming device was respectively ﬁxed
using a tripod, hand-held, and hand-held but with constant
movements of approximate 2cm in the horizontal or the vertical
directions. The recording device was placed on the left-front,
front, and right-front of the target device. In the experiment, we
afﬁxed the target device on a table using double-sided tapes.
We use a reference point to quantify camera shake. The
point is the center position of an area of the target device.
The area is marked by a boundary box on the ﬁrst frame (see
Figure 5). We calculate the difference (in terms of pixels) of
the locations of the reference point in two consecutive video
frames. We then use the difference to measure the degree of
camera shake. Figure 20 shows the cumulative distribution
function (CDF) of camera shake under the three different
ﬁlming settings. Here, the wider the distribution is, the less
steady the ﬁlming is. The shaky mode is least stable where
the difference of the reference point between two video frames
can be up to 250 pixels.
Figure 21 shows that our approach has the same perfor-
mance under the hand-held and the ﬁxed modes. The modest
camera sake under the hand-held mode has little impact
on performance thanks to our camera-shake calibration. We
observe deteriorative performance under the shaky mode, but
the performance degradation is modest (80% vs 97% in ﬁve
attempts). In reality, an attacker would avoid drastic camera
shake by ﬁrmly holding the video recording device.
D. Impact of Lighting Conditions
Result 4: Low-light has a negative impact on the success rate
of the attack but our approach can still break over 70% of the
patterns when the video was ﬁlmed in a low-light environment.

than 5 candidate patterns were generated by our algorithm.

our algorithms to narrow the possible options down. This is
conﬁrmed by Figure 17. It shows that for most median and all
complex patterns, our system produces one candidate pattern
– the correct one for most of our test cases.
We also evaluated our approach using the top 60 most
complex patterns (according to Equation 2) on a 3 × 3 grid.
To evaluate our approach on a wide range of patterns, we
exclude patterns that are simply a rotation to an already chosen
pattern. Figure 14 illustrates three highly complex patterns
which have a complexity score between 43.8 and 46.8. The
three patterns use all the nine dots of the grid and have a larger
number of line segments, intersections and overlapping lines
when compared to simpler patterns. Because of their complex
graphical structures, remembering these patterns using direct
observation techniques would be difﬁcult. In this experiment,
we can crack all the complex patterns in one attempt. This
result reinforces our claim that complex patterns are less
security under video-based attacks.
B. Impact of Filming Distances
Result 2: We can crack over 80% of the patterns in ﬁve
attempts, if the video was ﬁlmed using a smartphone within
a distance of 2.5 meters away from the target.
We would like to know how the ﬁlming distance affects
the success rate of the attack. To do so, we used all the 120
collected patterns and we varied the ﬁlming distance from 1
meter to 3.5 meters. Figure 19 shows how the cracking success
rate changes as the ﬁlming distance increases. There are minor
discrepancies in the success rate between this diagram and
Figure 16 because we used less patterns in this experiment.
When the ﬁlming distance is less than 2 meters, our approach
can crack all patterns in ﬁve attempts. The success rate drops
signiﬁcantly when the ﬁlming distance is greater than 2.5
meters. Beyond this point, the quality of the video ﬁlmed by
a mobile phone tends to drop signiﬁcantly with many object
deformations. The degradation of the video quality makes it
difﬁcult for the TLD algorithm to successfully track objects
across video frames. This is conﬁrmed by Table III which
shows that the tracking precision for the ﬁngertip and the
device edge drops from around 99% to 68% when the ﬁlming
distance increases from 2 meters to 3.5 meters. The increased
tracking failures result in an increased number of missing

expected as low-light leads to increased video noise, blurred
motions and poor focus, which all have a negative impact on
the TLD algorithm. Nonetheless, our attack can still crack over
70% of the patterns in a ﬁlming environment of low light.
E. Impact of Filming Angle Estimation
Result 5: Our attack performs well when the error of ﬁlming
angle estimation is less than 5 degrees.
Recall
that our attack needs to transform the ﬁngertip
movement trajectory to the user’s perspective based on an
estimation of the ﬁlming angle (Section IV-C). Because our
ﬁlming angle estimation algorithm gives highly accurate re-
sults, we did not ﬁnd the estimation error to be an issue in
our experiments. Nonetheless, it is worth studying how the
estimation error affects the success rate of our attack. To do
so, we deliberately added an error of 5-10 degrees to the
estimation in this experiment.
Figure 23 shows the results of this experiment. When the
error is less than ±5 degrees, there is little impact on complex
Figure 21.
Impact of camera shake. Our approach has the same success rate
under the hand-held and the ﬁxed modes and the performance degradation
under the shaky mode is modest.
In this experiment, videos were recorded under different
lighting conditions both indoor and outdoor. The experimental
settings are given in Table IV. The light intensity of these
condidtions ranges from 9500 lux (strong light), onto 240 lux
(normal light), and 55-70 lux (low light). These represent some
of the day-to-day scenarios where ﬁlming can take place. For
each setting, we tested all the 120 patterns on a Xiaomi MI4
phone and used an iPhone4S phone to record the video. The
ﬁlming camera was place on the left-front, front, and the right-
front of the target device from a distance of 2 meters.
Figure 22 shows that the success rate increases when video
ﬁlming were performed in a brighter lighting condition as
the light intensity changes from 55 lux to 9500 lux. This is

However, an estimation error of more than 10 degrees can
signiﬁcantly affect the success rate. Given such errors, the
resulting trajectory after transformations will be signiﬁcant
different from the correct pattern. For example, when the
estimation error is 10 degrees from the true value, on average,
0.8, 2.6 and 4.2 line segments per pattern respectively will be
incorrectly labelled for simple, median and complex patterns.
This explains why the success rate for complex patterns drops
signiﬁcantly when the ﬁlming angle estimation error is greater
or equal to 10 degrees.
