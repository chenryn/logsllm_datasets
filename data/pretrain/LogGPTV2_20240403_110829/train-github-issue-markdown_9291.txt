Type the entire first line, move to the second line, the text bar starts in
front of the first word on the second line and caret is placed at the
beginning of the first word.
  * [ x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Caret is placed after the last symbol.
## Current Behavior
Caret is placed at the beginning of the last word.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
It is reproducible in some specific environment: cordova + crosswalk project.
So I'm sure that it is specific to chromium engine. And I'm going to create a
PR to resolve this issue. So hopefully it will be enough.
