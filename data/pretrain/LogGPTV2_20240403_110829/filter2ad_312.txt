considered trusted  (at  least  implicitly)  by  his 
organization  because  he  is  granted  access  to  its 
computing  environment.    Whether  or  not  that 
insider  is  in  fact  trustworthy  is  a  question  that 
lies  at  the  heart  of  the  insider  threat  problem.  
Complicating this problem is the fact that there is 
no  “one  size  fits  all”  description  of  a  malicious 
insider.  Motivations, objectives, cyber expertise, 
system  privileges  all  can  and  do  vary  from  one 
case to the next.

Any  comprehensive  solution 
to  countering 
insider  threats  must  consider  a  wide  range  of 
technical  problems,  many  of  which  still  exist 
largely in the research realm.  Examples include 
automated  real-time  detection  of  anomalous 
behavior;  another  is  originator  control  over

Panelist are all actively engaged in insider threat 
research for the US Intelligence Community and 
will  provide  their  own  unique  perspectives  on 
the  current  state  of  the  art,  gaps  in  current 
capabilities,  and  recommendations  on  what 
needs to be done to shrink the gaps. The Panelist 
will also cover visionary (what do we want?) as

Terrance  Goan:  Making  progress  in  insider 
threat  detection  will  require  reconsidering  some 
basic  concepts.    First,  we  as  a  community  need 
to  consider  new  means  of  evaluating  behaviors 
over months or even years, and for incorporating

down on the number of alerts, new systems must 
be able to learn through feedback that anomalous

an  insider  to  launch  a  successful  attack  without 
being  noticed.  However,  since  no  technique  is 
100%  secure,  detection  and  a  tamper-resistant 
logging  and  trace-back  mechanism  must  be  in 
place  so  that  essential  details  about  the  attack

“jewels”  that  insiders  may  pursue  are  usually 
documents  of  high  value  such  as  intellectual

- and then do damage.  Many insider actions can

to  be  completely  authorized  and

sophisticated  attack.    I  will  discuss  the  research 
being done in the following areas, which, I feel, 
is vital to addressing the malicious insider threat: 
o the use of automated technology to 
gather network and insider information 
o modeling users and networks 
o advanced reasoning techniques to 
identify sophisticated attacks
