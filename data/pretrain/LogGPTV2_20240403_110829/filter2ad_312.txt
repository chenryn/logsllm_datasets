## Panel Theme

One of the most critical challenges facing the information security community is the threat posed by malicious insiders. An insider is typically considered trusted (at least implicitly) by their organization because they are granted access to its computing environment. However, whether this trust is justified is at the heart of the insider threat problem. Complicating this issue is the fact that there is no "one size fits all" description of a malicious insider. Their motivations, objectives, cyber expertise, and system privileges can vary widely from one case to another.

## Comprehensive Solutions

A comprehensive solution to countering insider threats must address a wide range of technical issues, many of which are still in the research phase. Examples include automated real-time detection of anomalous behavior and originator control over electronic documents (e.g., dissemination, copying, printing, etc.). The panelists, who are actively engaged in insider threat research for the U.S. Intelligence Community, will provide their unique perspectives on the current state of the art, gaps in current capabilities, and recommendations for addressing these gaps. They will also discuss both visionary (what do we want?) and practical (what is achievable in the next few years?) solutions.

## Panelist Perspectives and Issues

### Terrance Goan: Reconsidering Basic Concepts

To make progress in insider threat detection, we need to reconsider some fundamental concepts. First, the community should evaluate behaviors over extended periods, such as months or even years, and incorporate non-traditional data sources like personnel reports. Second, these more comprehensive systems must generate summary reports that can be easily understood by managers and supervisors, as computer security staff may not always be in a position to make adequate assessments. Third, to reduce the number of alerts, new systems must learn through feedback to distinguish between truly suspicious behavior and the normal variations of everyday work.

### Shambhu Upadhyaya: Multi-Faceted Approach

The insider threat is a complex problem that requires a multi-faceted approach with radical solutions and paradigm shifts. A hardened computational environment can make it difficult for an insider to launch a successful attack without being noticed. However, since no technique is 100% secure, detection and tamper-resistant logging and trace-back mechanisms must be in place to collect essential details about the attack and refine security policies. The "jewels" that insiders may pursue are typically high-value documents such as intellectual property, confidential information, and military intelligence. We present a sequence of steps—Threat Models, Decentralized Accountability, Prevention of Tampering, Pollution and Information Falsification, and Finer Access Controls and Event Logging—to mitigate the insider threat.

### Allen Ott: Addressing Sophisticated Attacks

Most existing information security systems are designed to prevent remote entry by external hackers. Meanwhile, sophisticated professionals often gain initial entry through the acquisition of passwords or via insiders—disloyal casual or full-time employees—and then cause damage. Many insider actions can appear completely authorized and legitimate but are, in fact, part of a sophisticated attack. I will discuss the following areas of research, which I believe are vital to addressing the malicious insider threat:
- The use of automated technology to gather network and insider information
- Modeling users and networks
- Advanced reasoning techniques to identify sophisticated attacks
