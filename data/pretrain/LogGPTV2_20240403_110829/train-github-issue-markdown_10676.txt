 **I'm submitting a ...**  
I'm not sure... possibly an issue, possibly a bug, possibly just a request for
clarification. It's hard to tell for sure without knowing more, and I've hit a
wall.
**Current behavior**  
Using the most recent IE and Edge on Windows 10, mousemove events (and
possibly others) over large amounts of angular-generated elements is very
slow, causing usablity problems.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
For these generated elements not to cause events to be throttled as such
**Background**  
I tried creating a fake "selection rectangle" overlaying div to select
underlying table cells for quick editing instead of one-by-one editing.
However, this selection rectangle responded to mousemove events painfully
slowly in Internet Explorer (and I later noticed, Edge) causing the visual on-
screen selection rectangle to update up to 10x slower than in other browsers.
I spent some time stripping unnecessary code until it boiled down to this code
working as epexcted:
        Name
        FastFastFastFastFast
while this similar code introduces the problem of the throttled events:
        Name
        Slow

**Notes**
  * _In trying to solve this, I've run across several issues about the speed at which angular creates the element - that's not my issue. It's the frequency/rate of events such as mouseover on those elements after they've already been generated._
  * _Due to the nature of the project, generating less elements isn't an option (and really, that shouldn't be necessary anyway)._
  * _When viewing the Plnkr, please make sure to use Internet Explorer or Edge to be able to see the issue (although you can use another browser for comparison as well, of course)._
  * _(UPDATED) This seems to be a problem with Windows 10 specifically. It occurs on two separate Windows 10 systems, and does not occur on two separate Windows 7 systems. I tried running Windows 7 in a VM on a Windows 10 system and it performs better there than it does in Windows 10. I don't even know what to make of that anymore._
