I have a YML file that I parse, which has the following syntax for an empty
array:
`some_field: [ ]`
Upon dumping the same YML file, and not adjusting `some_field`, the value is
dumped as:
`some_field: { }`
My understanding is that the `{ }` syntax is intended for objects, not arrays.
As such, I isolated the code found in the `dumpArray` function which was
introducing this behavior:
https://github.com/symfony/yaml/blob/2.8/Inline.php#L191
`return sprintf('{ %s }', implode(', ', $output));`
.... adjusted to ....
`return sprintf('[ %s ]', implode(', ', $output));`
... fixes this issue.
Is there a reason why this is using the object-based syntax and not the array
syntax?
