I want to use Sourcegraph code search and code review with scikit-learn. A
project maintainer needs to enable it to set up a webhook so the code is up-
to-date there.
Could you please enable scikit-learn on @sourcegraph by going to
https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn and clicking on
Settings? (It should only take 15 seconds.)
Thank you!
