User:  How to setup Nginx reverse proxy? Please provide configuration example and operation steps.
Assistant: Nginx is a high-performance web server and reverse proxy server. By configuring the reverse proxy, the client's request can be forwarded to the back-end application server, so as to achieve functions such as load balancing and high availability. The following are the basic steps to set up Nginx reverse proxy: 1. Install Nginx Just use the package manager to install Nginx on the Linux system. For example, the following command can be used to install on an Ubuntu system: ``` sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx ``` 2. Configure Nginx In the Nginx configuration file, you need to define the host and port number of the reverse proxy and other information. For details, please refer to the following sample configuration: ``` server { listen 80; server_name mywebsite.com; location / { proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; } } ` `` Explanation: - `listen`: Specify the port number that Nginx listens to, such as port 80. - `server_name`: hostname, such as mywebsite.com, used to match the hostname requested by the client. - `location`: defines the configuration information of the reverse proxy. - `proxy_pass`: Specify the address and port number of the backend application server, such as http://localhost:8080. - `proxy_set_header`: Custom request headers, such as Host and X-Real-IP, etc. 3. Restart Nginx After completing the above steps, you need to restart Nginx to make the configuration take effect. You can use the following command to restart Nginx: ``` sudo service nginx restart ``` So far, the configuration of the Nginx reverse proxy has been completed. It should be noted that the above sample configuration is for reference only, and the specific configuration information needs to be modified according to the actual situation.
