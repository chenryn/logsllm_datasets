User: I am trying to create a PNG from DOT file

dot -Tpng  -o temp.png

and  I am getting the below errors:

Warning: node s1, port eth2 unrecognized
Warning: node s2, port eth2 unrecognized
Warning: node s2, port eth3 unrecognized
Warning: node s3, port eth2 unrecognized
Warning: node s4, port eth4 unrecognized
Warning: node s3, port eth3 unrecognized

DOT FILE 1:

graph G {
    node [shape=record];
    graph [hostidtype="hostname", version="1:0", date="04/12/2013"];
    edge [dir=none, len=1, headport=center, tailport=center];
    "s1":"eth2" -- "s2":"eth2";
    "s2":"eth3" -- "s3":"eth2";
    "s4":"eth4" -- "s3":"eth3";
}

When I try with the below topology file, it works.
DOT FILE 2

graph G {
    node [shape=record];
    graph [hostidtype="hostname", version="1:0", date="04/12/2013"];
    edge [dir=none, len=1, headport=center, tailport=center];
    "R1":"swp1" -- "R3":"swp3";
    "R1":"swp2" -- "R4":"swp3";
}


What is the difference here. For what reason is DOT FILE 1 giving errors ?
Assistant: Your example is missing some information (a description of the nodes). Assuming those are somewhere and have just been omitted from your example,
maybe the problem is that using node [shape=record] doesn't work with the port HTML attribute. For example, try node [shape=plaintext].
