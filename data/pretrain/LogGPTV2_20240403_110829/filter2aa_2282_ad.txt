Printing	
  Process	
Preparing	
  the	
  drawing	
3D	
  models	
  are	
  drawn	
  in	
  standard	
  CAD	
  software	
  and	
  then	
  imported	
  (STL/etc)	
  into	
  the	
  CubePro	
  (or	
  other	
CAM	
  software)	
  to	
  slice	
  the	
  model	
  into	
  2D	
  layers	
  suitable	
  for	
  printing.	
Preparing	
  the	
  Plate	
The	
  CubePro	
  uses	
  a	
  print	
  plate	
  with	
  a	
  coating	
  of	
  water-­‐soluble	
  glue	
  that	
  is	
  dissolved	
  after	
  the	
  print	
allowing	
  the	
  model	
  to	
  be	
  scraped	
  off.	
  The	
  first	
  step	
  is	
  to	
  coat	
  the	
  printed	
  surface	
  with	
  this	
  glue	
  so	
  that	
  the	
extruded	
  filament	
  adheres	
  to	
  the	
  print	
  plate	
  rather	
  than	
  itself.	
Extrusion	
Drive	
  gears	
  on	
  the	
  extruder	
  feed	
  filament	
  into	
  a	
  hot	
  print	
  nozzle.	
  When	
  the	
  print	
  starts,	
  the	
  extruder	
  and	
the	
  print	
  area	
  both	
  are	
  heated	
  until	
  the	
  filament	
  begins	
  to	
  extrude.	
  Excess	
  filament	
  is	
  pushed	
  into	
  a	
  trash	
bin	
  and	
  then	
  wiped	
  off	
  before	
  a	
  print	
  commences.	
Movement	
The	
  extruder	
  is	
  on	
  a	
  gantry	
  moving	
  along	
  the	
  x	
  and	
  y-­‐axis	
  while	
  the	
  print	
  bed	
  moves	
  down	
  gradually	
  to	
provide	
  the	
  z	
  axis.	
  As	
  each	
  layer	
  is	
  drawn,	
  fans	
  are	
  switched	
  on	
  and	
  off	
  as	
  needed	
  to	
  perform	
  cooling.	
Retrieving	
  the	
  Print	
After	
  the	
  printer	
  has	
  completely	
  generated	
  a	
  model,	
  it	
  will	
  be	
  stuck	
  the	
  to	
  print	
  plate	
  thanks	
  to	
  the	
  glue	
applied	
  before	
  printing.	
  The	
  object	
  is	
  removed	
  by	
  soaking	
  in	
  warm	
  water	
  for	
  several	
  minutes	
  and	
  then	
carefully	
  prying	
  the	
  model	
  away	
  from	
  the	
  build	
  plate.

  Pitfalls	
3D	
  printing	
  is	
  not	
  yet	
  a	
  consumer	
  friendly	
  technology.	
  CAD	
  skills	
  as	
  well	
  as	
  some	
  sense	
  of	
  industrial	
design	
  and	
  materials	
  science	
  are	
  needed	
  to	
  excel	
  at	
  creating	
  custom	
  3d	
  components.	
  Printers	
  can	
  also	
have	
  tedious	
  calibration	
  processes	
  wasting	
  time	
  and	
  filament	
  for	
  the	
  operator.	
  Beyond	
  this,	
  operation	
  of	
an	
  extrusion	
  based	
  3D	
  printer	
  will	
  almost	
  inevitably	
  lead	
  to	
  debris	
  jamming	
  the	
  drive	
  gears	
  or	
  clogging	
the	
  print	
  nozzle.	
  This	
  is	
  why	
  it	
  is	
  important	
  to	
  know	
  how	
  to	
  clean	
  critical	
  printing	
  parts	
  disassembling	
them	
  as	
  needed.	
  For	
  the	
  VERT	
  Makerbot	
  replicator	
  5,	
  this	
  happened	
  between	
  basically	
  every	
  single	
  print.	
On	
  the	
  CubePro	
  the	
  first	
  clog/jam	
  did	
  not	
  occur	
  until	
  after	
  more	
  than	
  700g	
  of	
  models	
  had	
  been	
successfully	
  printed.	
  At	
  that	
  point,	
  the	
  debris	
  show	
  below	
  led	
  to	
  filament	
  flow	
  errors	
  and	
  disassembly	
  of	
the	
  extruder.

  Coil	
  (Antenna)	
  Forms	
The	
  LC	
  tank	
  used	
  by	
  RFID	
  devices	
  involves	
  a	
  coil	
  (inductor)	
  tuned	
  to	
  the	
  capacitor	
  for	
  the	
  desired	
resonance	
  frequency.	
  The	
  induction	
  of	
  the	
  coil	
  is	
  dependent	
  on	
  the	
  shape,	
  size,	
  wire	
  diameter	
  and	
number	
  of	
  turns	
  in	
  the	
  coil.	
  Microchip	
  has	
  an	
  excellent	
  application	
  note	
  describing	
  the	
  calculations	
  for	
various	
  shapes	
  and	
  properties	
  of	
  RFID	
  antennas15.	
  The	
  proxmark3	
  GitHub	
  also	
  contains	
  details	
  of	
antenna16	
  designs	
  specific	
  to	
  the	
  proxmark3	
  but	
  which	
  can	
  be	
  modified	
  for	
  other	
  applications	
  with	
  the	
appropriate	
  calculations	
  or	
  measurements.	
  3d	
  printing	
  can	
  easily	
  produce	
  the	
  shapes	
  needed	
  to	
  form	
wires	
  into	
  the	
  desired	
  shapes	
  with	
  precise	
  measurements.	
  Once	
  an	
  antenna	
  form	
  has	
  been	
  designed,	
  it	
can	
  be	
  integrated	
  with	
  other	
  models	
  to	
  make	
  coils	
  hidden	
  within	
  other	
  objects	
  such	
  as	
  clipboards,	
lanyards,	
  phone	
  cases,	
  or	
  even	
  fake	
  card	
  readers.

  from

  but	
using	
  3D

  to	
  create	
  the

  The

  demonstrated	
  higher

Heat

  (optional)	
And	
  some	
  basic	
  tools:	
Soldering	
  iron	
Wire	
  strippers	
To	
  start,	
  tape	
  down	
  a	
  length	
  of	
  wire	
  on	
  the	
  front	
  and	
  pull	
  it	
  to	
  the	
  back	
  with	
  the	
  wire’s	
  groove.	
  Now	
  count	
with	
  each	
  bend	
  of	
  the	
  wire	
  (i.e.	
  count	
  4	
  per	
  turn)	
  until	
  you	
  reach	
  480	
  (120	
  turns).	
  Be	
  careful	
  with	
  each	
turn	
  that	
  the	
  wire	
  is	
  not	
  caught	
  on	
  the	
  side	
  of	
  the	
  form	
  or	
  anywhere	
  other	
  than	
  directly	
  in	
  the	
  path	
  for	
  the	
wire.	
  At	
  the	
  end,	
  pull	
  a	
  length	
  of	
  the	
  wire	
  to	
  the	
  front,	
  tape	
  it	
  down,	
  and	
  solder	
  a	
  short	
  wire	
  to	
  each	
  end	
  of	
the	
  coil.	
  This	
  is	
  more	
  than	
  enough	
  turns	
  but	
  this	
  is	
  a	
  case	
  where	
  extra	
  is	
  definitely	
  better	
  than	
  not	
  having	
enough.	
  Removing	
  turns	
  from	
  the
