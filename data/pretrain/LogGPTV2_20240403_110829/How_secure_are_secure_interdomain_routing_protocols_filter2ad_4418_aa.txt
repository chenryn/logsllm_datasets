ABSTRACT
In response to high-proﬁle Internet outages, BGP security
variants have been proposed to prevent the propagation of
bogus routing information. To inform discussions of which
variant should be deployed in the Internet, we quantify the
ability of the main protocols (origin authentication, soBGP,
S-BGP, and data-plane veriﬁcation) to blunt traﬃc-attraction
attacks; i.e., an attacker that deliberately attracts traﬃc to
drop, tamper, or eavesdrop on packets.
Intuition suggests that an attacker can maximize the traf-
ﬁc he attracts by widely announcing a short path that is
not ﬂagged as bogus by the secure protocol. Through simu-
lations on an empirically-determined AS-level topology, we
show that this strategy is surprisingly eﬀective, even when
the network uses an advanced security solution like S-BGP
or data-plane veriﬁcation. Worse yet, we show that these
results underestimate the severity of attacks. We prove
that ﬁnding the most damaging strategy is NP-hard, and
show how counterintuitive strategies, like announcing longer
paths, announcing to fewer neighbors, or triggering BGP
loop-detection, can be used to attract even more traﬃc than
the strategy above. These counterintuitive examples are not
merely hypothetical; we searched the empirical AS topology
to identify speciﬁc ASes that can launch them. Finally, we
ﬁnd that a clever export policy can often attract almost
as much traﬃc as a bogus path announcement. Thus, our
work implies that mechanisms that police export policies
(e.g., defensive ﬁltering) are crucial, even if S-BGP is fully
deployed.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet is notoriously vulnerable to traﬃc attrac-
tion attacks, where Autonomous Systems (ASes) manipu-
late BGP to attract traﬃc to, or through, their networks.
Attracting extra traﬃc enables the AS to increase revenue

from customers, or drop, tamper, or snoop on the pack-
ets [2–4]. While the proposed extensions to BGP prevent
many attacks (see [5] for a survey), even these secure pro-
tocols are susceptible to a strategic manipulator who de-
liberately exploits their weaknesses to attract traﬃc to its
network. Given the diﬃculty of upgrading the Internet to a
new secure routing protocol, it is crucial to understand how
well these protocols blunt the impact of traﬃc attraction
attacks.

We evaluate the four major extensions to BGP, ordered
from weakest to strongest: origin authentication [6,7], soBGP
[8], S-BGP [9], and data-plane veriﬁcation [5,10]. While the
stronger protocols prevent a strictly larger set of attacks
than the weaker ones, these security gains often come with
signiﬁcant implementation and deployment costs. To inform
discussions about which of these secure protocols should be
deployed, we would like to quantitatively compare their abil-
ity to limit traﬃc attraction attacks. Thus, we simulate at-
tacks on each protocol on an empirically-measured AS-level
topology [11–13], and determine the percentage of ASes that
forward traﬃc to the manipulator.
Performing a quantitative comparison requires some care.
It does not suﬃce to say that one protocol, say S-BGP, is
four times as eﬀective as another protocol, say origin au-
thentication, at preventing a speciﬁc type of attack strategy;
there may be other attack strategies for which the quantita-
tive gap between the two protocols is signiﬁcantly smaller.
Since these more clever attack strategies can just as easily
occur in the wild, our comparison must be in terms of the
worst possible attack that the manipulator could launch on
each protocol. To do this, we put ourselves in the mind of
the manipulator, and look for the optimal strategy he can
use to attract traﬃc from as many ASes as possible.
However, before we can even begin thinking about opti-
mal strategies for traﬃc attraction, we ﬁrst need a model
for the way traﬃc ﬂows in the Internet.
In practice, this
depends on local routing policies used by each AS, which
are not publicly known. However, the BGP decision pro-
cess breaks ties by selecting shorter routes over longer ones,
and it is widely believed [14] that policies depend heavily on
economic considerations. Thus, conventional wisdom and
prior work [14–16] suggests basing routing policies on busi-
ness relationships and AS-path lengths. While this model
(used in many other studies, e.g., [2, 17]) does not capture
all the intricacies of interdomain routing, it is still very use-
ful for gaining insight into traﬃc attraction attacks. All of
our results are attained within this model.

If routing policies are based on AS path lengths, then in-
tuition suggests that it is optimal for the manipulator to
announce the shortest path that the protocol does not reject
as bogus, to as many neighbors as possible. Depending on
the security protocol, this means announcing a direct con-
nection to the victim IP preﬁx, a fake edge to the legitimate
destination AS, a short path that exists but was never adver-
tised, a short path that the manipulator learned but is not
using, or even a legitimate path that deviates from normal
export policy.
Indeed, we use simulations on a measured
AS-level topology to show that this “smart” attack strat-
egy is quite eﬀective, even against advanced secure routing
protocols like S-BGP and data-plane veriﬁcation.
Worse yet, we show that our simulations underestimate
the amount of damage manipulator could cause. Through
counterexamples, show that the “smart” attack is surpris-
ingly not optimal. In fact, the following bizarre strategies
can sometimes attract even more traﬃc than the “smart” at-
tack: announcing a longer path, exporting a route to fewer
neighbors, or triggering BGP’s loop-detection mechanism.
In fact, we show that preﬁx hijacking (i.e., originating a
preﬁx you do not own) is not always the most eﬀective at-
tack against today’s BGP! These counterexamples are not
merely hypothetical—we identify speciﬁc ASes in the mea-
sured AS-level topology that could launch them. Moreover,
we prove that it is NP-hard to ﬁnd the manipulator’s op-
timal attack, suggesting that a comprehensive comparison
across protocols must remain elusive.

While we necessarily underestimate the amount of dam-
age a manipulator could cause, we can make a number of
concrete statements. Our main ﬁnding is that secure rout-
ing protocols only deal with one half of the problem: while
they do restrict the paths the manipulator can announce,
they fail to restrict his export policies. Thus, our simula-
tions show that, when compared to BGP and origin authen-
tication, soBGP and S-BGP signiﬁcantly limit the manipu-
lator’s ability to attract traﬃc by announcing bogus short
paths to all its neighbors. However, even in a network with
S-BGP or data-plane veriﬁcation, we found that a manip-
ulator can still attract traﬃc by cleverly manipulating his
export policies. Indeed, we found that announcing a short
path is often less important than exporting that path to the
right set of neighbors. Thus:
(cid:129) Advanced security protocols like S-BGP and data-plane
veriﬁcation do not signiﬁcantly outperform soBGP for
the “smart” attacks we evaluated.
(cid:129) Defensive ﬁltering of paths exported by stub ASes (i.e.,
ASes without customers) provides a level of protection
that is at least comparable to that provided by soBGP,
S-BGP and even data-plane veriﬁcation.
(cid:129) Tier 2 ASes are in the position to attract the largest
volumes of traﬃc, even in the presence of data-plane
veriﬁcation and defensive ﬁltering (of stubs).
(cid:129) Interception attacks [2,3]—where the manipulator both
attracts traﬃc and delivers it to the destination—are
easy for many ASes, especially large ones.

We could quibble about whether or not manipulating export
policies even constitutes an attack ; after all, each AS has the
right to decide where it announces paths. However, our re-
sults indicate that a clever export policy can attract almost
as much traﬃc as a bogus path announcement. Indeed, Sec-
tion 6.1 presents an example where an AS in the measured
topology gains almost as much exporting a provider-learned
path to another provider, as he would by a preﬁx hijack
(announcing that he owns the IP preﬁx). Thus, our results
suggest that addressing traﬃc attraction attacks requires
both mechanisms that prevent bogus path announcements
(e.g., soBGP or S-BGP) as well as mechanisms that police
export policies (e.g., defensive ﬁltering).

2. MODEL AND METHODOLOGY
We ﬁrst present a model of interdomain routing and rout-
ing policies, based on the standard models in [18] and the
Gao-Rexford conditions [15], followed by our threat model
for traﬃc attraction, and ﬁnally our experimental setup.
2.1  Modeling  i nterdomain  routin.
The AS graph. The interdomain-routing system is mod-
eled with a labeled graph called an AS graph, as in Figure 1.
Each AS is modeled as a single node and denoted by its
AS number. Edges represent direct physical communication
links between ASes. Adjacent ASes are called neighbors.
Since changes in topology typically occur on a much longer
timescale than the execution of the protocol, we follow [18]
and assume the AS-graph topology is static. BGP computes
paths to each destination IP preﬁx separately, so we assume
that there is a unique destination IP preﬁx to which all other
nodes attempt to establish a path. As shown in Figure 1,
there is a single AS v that rightfully ‘owns’ the destination
IP preﬁx under consideration.
Establishing paths.
In BGP, an AS ﬁrst chooses an
outgoing edge on which it forwards traﬃc based on a local
ranking on outgoing paths, and then announces this path
to some subset of its neighbors. To model this, we assume
that each node n has a set of routing policies, consisting of
(a) a ranking on outgoing paths from n to the destination
d, and (b) a set of export policies, a mapping of each path P
to the set of neighbors to which n is willing to announce the
path P . We say that node n has an available path aP d if n’s
neighbor a announced the path “aP d” to n. If an available
path aP d is ranked higher than the outgoing path that node
n is currently using, then an normal node n will (a) forward
88traﬃc to node a, and (b) announce the path naP d to all his
neighbors as speciﬁed by his export policies.
Business relationships.
We annotate the AS graph
with the standard model for business relationships in the
Internet [15]; while more complicated business relationships
exist in practice, the following is widely believed to cap-
ture the majority of the economic relationships in the In-
ternet. As shown in Figure 1, there are two kinds of edges:
customer-provider (where the customer pays the provider
for connectivity, represented with an arrow from customer
to provider), and peer-to-peer (where two ASes owned by
diﬀerent organizations agree to transit each other’s traﬃc
at no cost, represented with an undirected edge). Because
some of our results are based on CAIDA’s AS graph [11],
we also consider sibling-to-sibling edges. Details about our
treatment of siblings is in the full version [1]. Finally, our
theoretical results sometimes use [15]’s assumption that an
AS cannot be its own indirect customer:
GR1 The AS graph contains no customer-provider cycles.
2.2  Modeling  routing  policies
In practice, the local routing policies used by each AS in
the Internet are arbitrary and not publicly known. However,
because we want to understand how false routing informa-
tion propagates through the Internet, we need to concretely
model routing policies. Since it is widely believed that busi-
ness relationships play a large role in determining the routing
policies of a given AS [14, 15], and we have reasonably ac-
curate empirical maps of the business relationships between
ASes [11–13], we base our model on these relationships.
Rankings. BGP is ﬁrst and foremost designed to prevent
loops. Thus, we assume that node a rejects an announce-
ment from its neighbor b if it contains a loop, i.e., if node a
appears on the path that node b announces. Beyond that,
we can think of the process ASes use to select routes as fol-
lows; ﬁrst applying local preferences, then choosing shortest
AS paths, and ﬁnally applying a tie break. Since the local
preferences of each AS are unknown, and are widely believed
to be based (mostly) on business relationships, we model the
three step process as follows:
LP Local Preference. Prefer outgoing paths where the
next hop is a customer over outgoing paths where the
next hop is a peer over paths where the next hop is a
provider.
SP Shortest Paths. Among the paths with the highest
local preference, chose the shortest ones.
TB Tie Break. If there are multiple such paths, choose
the one whose next hop has the lowest AS number.1
Our model of local preferences is based on on Gao-Rexford
condition GR3, and captures the idea that an AS has an
economic incentive to prefer forwarding traﬃc via customer
(that pays him) over a peer (where no money is exchanged)
over a provider (that he must pay). Notice that this implies
that an AS can sometimes prefer a longer path! (e.g., in
Figure 1, AS m prefers the ﬁve-hop customer path through
a3 over the four-hop provider path through Tier 1 T 1.)
1We need a consistent way to break ties. In practice, this
is done using the intradomain distance between routers and
router IDs. Since our model does not incorporate geographic
distance or individual routers, we use AS number instead.
Export Policies. Our model of export policies is based
on the Gao-Rexford condition GR2:
GR2 AS b will only announce a path via AS c to AS a if
at least one of a and c are customers of b.
GR2 captures the idea that an AS should only be willing
to load his own network with transit traﬃc if he gets paid
to do so. However, because GR2 does not fully specify the
export policies of every AS (for instance, an AS could decide
to export paths to only a subset of his customers), it does
not suﬃce for our purposes. Thus, we model normal export
policies as follows:
NE An AS will announce all paths to all neighbors except
when GR2 forbids him to do so.
