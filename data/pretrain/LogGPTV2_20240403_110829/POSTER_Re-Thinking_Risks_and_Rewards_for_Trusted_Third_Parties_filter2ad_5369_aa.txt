INTRODUCTION 
The establishment of a global electronic business environment is one of the most 
exciting challenges facing the telecommunications industry today. Confidence in 
that environment, or the lack of it, will be a crucial factor in deciding its success 
or failure.  Possibly the most important techniques available to us to generate that 
confidence  fall  within  the  purview  of  cryptography.  Cryptography  aims  to 
achieve two essential, but independent, goals. The first of these goals is to ensure 
the  confidentiality  of  data  on  an  open  network.  The  second  is  to  ensure  the 
authenticity of that data.  With these techniques and the infrastructure to  support 
their use in place we can envisage a safe, secure open electronic environment for 
conducting business. 
The  purpose  of this  chapter is  to  review  the  basic  features  and  practice  of 
cryptography. We shall begin with an overview of the basic techniques and con(cid:173)
cepts. In particular the important concept of a digital signature will be introduced 
and its significance for an electronic commerce framework explained. This leads 
us naturally on to the notion of certification and trusted intermediaries. We shall 
conclude with a discussion of the  political  issues surrounding the use  of strong 
cryptographic techniques and their importance for BT.

BASIC  CRYPTOGRAPHY 
5.2.1  Confidentiality and authenticity 
Historically, the protection of confidentiality has been the most important function 
of  a  cryptography  system.  This  is  partly  because  until  relatively  recently

cryptography has been the exclusive remit of those government organizations to 
whom  secrecy  is  paramount.  The  needs  of  today's  business  community  go 
beyond  the  provision  of  simple  confidentiality.  Authenticity  is  at  least  as 
important  if  not  more  so.  If  the  trend  to  a  global  electronic  market-place 
continues, more and more of our transactions will need to  be protected by strong 
cryptographic techniques. 
For so-called classical or secret-key cryptographic systems, confidentiality is 
achieved by taking the data to be protected and,  using  some  secret  information, 
transforming  it  into  a  form  unintelligible  to  anyone  who  does  not  possess  this 
secret piece  of information.  This  extra secret piece  of information  is  the  key.  A 
principal difficulty in the operation of secret-key cryptosystems is  that of distrib(cid:173)
uting  the  secret key to legitimate users.  The obvious analogy is  that of locking a 
box with a message inside it. Even though we may know how the lock works it is 
difficult to unlock without the key.  Anyone who wants to  read the data in the box 
needs a copy of the secret key. 
Cryptography achieves  the  same  kind  of thing  using  mathematical  transfor(cid:173)
mations.  We can think of the  mathematical  algorithm  which  scrambles  the data 
as  the locking mechanism and this extra information, the  key,  which  is  usually  a 
sequence  of binary  digits,  as  the  device to  activate or de-activate  the  algorithm. 
Cryptography  systems  should  be  designed  on  the  assumption  that  an  attacker 
knows the details of the algorithm so that the  confidentiality of a message is  not 
dependent in any way upon keeping the algorithm secret. 
One  of the  most  celebrated  algorithms  for  encryption  is  known  as  the  one(cid:173)
time pad. This cipher provides perfect secrecy  and cannot be  broken.  if properly 
implemented.  The  algorithm  is  extremely  simple.  The  ciphertext  is  produced 
from the bit-wise exclusive-or of the plaintext with the key.  The decryption algo(cid:173)
rithm  reproduces  the plaintext by  taking the bit-wise exclusive-or of the  cipher(cid:173)
text with the key. The main problem with this algorithm is that to achieve perfect 
secrecy the  key  must be  random,  as  long  as  the  message  is  to  be  encrypted and 
used  only  once.  Modem  secret-key  systems  aim  to  achieve  a  high  degree  of 
secrecy with a much shorter and more convenient key. 
There  is  another  kind  of cryptography  known  as  public-key  cryptography 
which achieves confidentiality by a different route.  To resort to  the  analogy of a 
lockable  box,  public-key  cryptography  is  like  having  a  box  that  everyone  can 
lock but the unlocking key  is  kept secret.  The mathematical transformations that 
scramble the data for  public-key  systems  are  of a  very  different  nature  to  those 
used for  secret-key cryptography. At first glance it might be  thought that  public(cid:173)
key cryptography solves the problem of having to  get secret keys to  each user of 
a  cryptosystem.  However,  because  the  locking  keys  are  widely  distributed  the 
authenticity  of these  keys  must  be  guaranteed  in  some  way.  The  difficulty  in 
public  key  systems  shifts  from  that  of  distributing  a  secret  key  to  one  of 
authenticating a public key. 
64  CRYPTOGRAPHY 
Authenticity  is  a  more  subtle  concept than  confidentiality  and  is  also  more 
difficult to achieve. Secrecy and authenticity are independent attributes of a cryp(cid:173)
tographic  system,  and  one does  not necessarily  imply  the  other.  An  interesting 
classification of the difference between authenticity and secrecy has been formu(cid:173)
lated by Xuejia Lai: 
• 
• 
a technique provides secrecy if its purpose is to determine who can receive a 
message; 
a technique provides authenticity if its purpose is to determine who can send 
a message. 
Message authenticity is therefore concerned with the integrity of the message 
and its sender. As  we shall see, cryptographic techniques can be used to provide 
very strong mechanisms for ensuring that integrity. 
5.2.2 
Elements of a cryptosystem 
The  basic  elements  of  any  cryptosystem  are  depicted  in  Fig.  5.1.  Our 
protagonists, Alice and Bob, wish to communicate in secret and their adversary is 
Eve, the eavesdropper, who wishes to discover the content of their exchange. The 
message,  m  (also  known  as  the  plaintext),  is  fed  into  an  encryption  algorithm 
together with a key, k, to produce the cryptogram or ciphertext, c. To decrypt the 
ciphertext and recover the message it is necessary to  feed  the  decryption key, d 
into the decryption algorithm together with the ciphertext. A cryptosystem whose 
encryption and decryption keys are simply related in the sense that knowledge of 
one  gives  knowledge  of the  other  is  known  as  a  symmetric-key  or  secret-key 
system. A system for which the encryption and decryption keys are different and 
one  is  not  easily  calculated  from  the  other is  known  as  an  asymmetric-key  or 
public-key system. We shall return to public-key systems later in the chapter, but 
for  the  meantime  we  shall  concentrate  on  secret-key  systems.  This  allows  a 
minor clarification of the discussion but is not significant. 
It  is  a  basic  assumption  when  designing  any  cryptosystem  that  an  attacker 
knows the  details of the encryption and decryption algorithms.  This  is  certainly 
true  of many  algorithms  in  current use  such  as  DES  (the  data encryption  stan(cid:173)
dard) and IDEA (international data encryption algorithm). However, some organ(cid:173)
izations who supply products utilizing cryptography do not reveal the algorithms 
used.  The  argument  for  this  approach  is  summarized  by  the  question:  'Why 
should we make it easier for an attacker?' This approach is often criticized on the 
grounds  that  secret  algorithms  have  not  withstood  the  scrutiny  of  the  inter(cid:173)
national  community  and  their strength  cannot  therefore  be  independently  veri(cid:173)
fied.  DES, for example has been known for over 20 years and a successful feas(cid:173)
ible attack has still not been demonstrated despite intensive efforts. Both of these

access to the ciphertext but not the keys. 
viewpoints  have  some  merit  and  individual  circumstances  should  determine 
which approach is adopted. 
It is therefore clear that the security of a well-designed cryptosystem does not 
depend on the  secrecy of the  algorithm.  The security depends on how  that algo(cid:173)
rithm uses the available secret information, that is,  the secret key. The security of 
any algorithm is  usually expressed in terms of the number of bits in  the  key. This 
is because an attack open to any eavesdropper is simply to try every possible key. 
This  kind  of attack  is  known  as  an  exhaustive  key  search  and  is  an  extremely 
important  concept  for  assessing  the  security  of a  cryptosystem.  An  exhaustive 
key  search  of a 40-bit  secret  key  system  requires  about  240  :::::10 12  operations  to 
determine  the  correct  key.  This  is  well  within  the  capabilities  of modern  com(cid:173)
puter systems  and data protected by only 40 bits of secret key  should be  consid(cid:173)
ered extremely vulnerable. We shall return  to  this 40-bit figure  when  we  discuss 
some of the political implications of using cryptography. 
5.2.3  Design  principles for  secret-key cryptosystems 
Before going further it is  useful  to  have  some  idea how  good cryptosystems are 
designed.  Again,  for  convenience,  we  shall  limit  our  attention  to  secret-key 
systems although some of the comments here also apply to  public-key systems. 
Some of the most important principles of good cipher design were enunciated 
by Claude Shannon over 50 years ago.  In particular he introduced the concepts of 
confusion  and  diffusion  [I].  What  we  would  like  to  arrange  is  that  very  little 
information about either the key or the plaintext is evident in the ciphertext. This 
is  the principle of confusion.  In terms of the  key,  it  aims  to  ensure that virtually 
all  of  the  key  is  used  to  produce  even  very  short  ciphertexts  so  that  every 
encrypted  message  character  will  depend  on  most,  ideally  ali,  of the  key.  The 
idea  behind  this  is  that  it  should  force  the  eavesdropper  to  find  the  whole  key 
66  CRYPTOGRAPHY 
rather than  being able to find pieces of the key.  Diffusion is a little different and 
aims to produce the situation where every digit of the  secret key or the plaintext 
affects many digits of the ciphertext. Changing just one digit of either the key or 
the plaintext should produce a very different ciphertext. 
Diffusion and confusion are commonly obtained by chaining together smaller 
ciphers that have good local confusion and diffusion. Each of these little ciphers 
has its own key. For cascade ciphers these keys are independent but for a product 
cipher  these  keys  are  derived  from  the  same  secret  key  using  a  key-schedule 
algorithm. An example of a product cipher is DES, and triple DES is an example 
of a cascade cipher. We shall take a look at DES in the next section and see how 
the  principles of confusion and diffusion  are  achieved in  a cryptosystem  that is 
widely used today. 
The  aim  of these  two  principles  is  to  ensure  that  an  eavesdropper's  fastest 
method of attack is an exhaustive key search. If this is achieved then the strength 
of the  cryptosystem can be  improved by  increasing  the  length  of the  secret key 
with an increase in security that is exponential in key length. The security of the 
system  in  this  context is  equivalent to  the  time  it takes  for  the  eavesdropper to 
discover the key.  Adding  an extra digit to the secret key  effectively  doubles  the 
time it takes for the eavesdropper to perform an exhaustive key search. 
5.2.4 
The data encryption standard 
The data encryption standard (DES  as  it is commonly called) is  one of the most 
famous  secret-key systems in current use. It was designed in the early 1970s and 
was  adopted as  a national standard in  1977 by the American National Bureau of 
Standards (NBS) (now known as the National Institute of Standards (NIST»  [2]. 
Although  numerous  attempts  have  been  made  to  find  weaknesses  in  DES,  no 
serious  flaws  have  been  found.  Despite  this  intensive  investigation  some 
cryptographers  remain  uneasy  about  the  true  security  of DES.  This  is  largely 
because  DES  was  designed  with  the  involvement  of the  US  National  Security 
Agency  (NSA)  (the  American  equivalent of the  UK's  GCHQ),  and  the  design 
principles  for  some  of the  cryptographic  elements  have  never  been  revealed. 
However,  it  is  also  true  to  say  that  almost  every  modification  made  to  these 
particular elements of DES  results  in  a weaker cipher.  It would  appear that  the 
involvement of the NSA has  resulted  in  a  strengthening  of DES  rather than  the 
converse. 
The basic structure of DES is shown in Fig. 5.2. It is made up of two kinds of 
cipher repeated a certain number of times.  Other secret-key cryptosystems  have 
the same structure. The first transformation is an involution cipher, an involution 
being a permutation that is its own inverse, which takes the data X and the key K 
and produces a ciphertext Y with the following properties:

Fig 5.2 
The basic structure of DES. Each round, apart from  the last, consists of two ciphers. The 
encryption and decryption algorithms are the same. Decryption is achieved by  reversing the key 
schedule. 
The  second  transformation  is  a  simple  unkeyed  permutation  which  has  the 
following properties: 
Y = P(X) 
x = p(n = P(P(X») 
...  (5.2) 
These  ciphers  are  their  own  inverses  so  that  the  encryption  and  decryption 
algorithms are the same and to decrypt one simply reverses the key schedule. 
As we can see from Fig. 5.2, DES  consists of 16 rounds of encryption. There 
is  a  very  good  reason  for  this  as  we  shall  discuss  later.  To  show  that  DES 
decrypts correctly we rely on the reversibility properties of the individual ciphers 
given in equations (5.1) and (5.2). If we label the data after each round of encryp(cid:173)
tion  as  Xj  and  the  data  after  each  round  of decryption  as  Yj  we  can  write  the 
encryption equations as:
