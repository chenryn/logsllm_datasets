Question: "Considering the defense mechanisms against CSRF attacks involving CSRF tokens, why would an attacker not succeed if they create a malicious form on their website with the intent of performing a CSRF attack?"
 "A": "Because browsers have built-in mechanisms that automatically detect and block all cross-site scripting attempts."
 "B": "Because the malicious form would lack a valid CSRF token that maps to the victim's session token, as the victim did not request the form legitimately."
 "C": "Because all modern web servers are equipped with artificial intelligence that can distinguish between legitimate and malicious requests."
 "D": "Because users are typically trained to recognize and avoid submitting forms that originate from unknown sources."
Answer: B
