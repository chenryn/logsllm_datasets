User: In a distributed system, how to solve the conflict problem of multiple nodes accessing the same resource at the same time?
Assistant: In a distributed system, the following methods can be used to solve the conflict problem of multiple nodes accessing the same resource at the same time: 1. Mutual exclusion locks: use mutual exclusion locks to achieve mutually exclusive access to shared resources. When a node needs to access a shared resource, it must first apply for a mutex. If the current lock is occupied by other nodes, the node needs to wait until the lock is released. 2. Optimistic locking: Optimistic locking is an optimistic locking method. It believes that concurrency conflicts are not high, so there is no need to use mutexes to protect shared resources. When introducing optimistic locking, a version number mechanism needs to be introduced at the same time. By comparing the version numbers to determine whether there is a concurrency conflict, if there is a conflict, you need to roll back the operation and try again. 3. Distributed transactions: Use distributed transactions to ensure the consistency of shared resources. Distributed transactions include mechanisms such as two-phase commit and compensation transactions, which can ensure the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability of data among multiple nodes. The above method can not only solve the problem of concurrency conflicts in the distributed system, but also ensure the correctness and consistency of data.
