User: Our website has encountered a DDoS attack, how to quickly detect and defend against this attack, and restore the normal operation of the website?
Assistant: The following are some methods to quickly detect and defend against DDoS attacks: 1. Monitor network traffic: Use network monitoring tools to continuously monitor network traffic and detect abnormal traffic in time. 2. Establish a baseline: Establish a baseline and judge according to the normal peak traffic of the website. If the traffic is much higher than the baseline, it may be a DDoS attack. 3. Use network defense equipment: Use professional DDoS defense equipment, such as load balancer, firewall, IPS/IDS, etc., to effectively defend against DDoS attacks. 4. Perform IP filtering: filter access through IP blacklist and whitelist, and reject illegal requests. 5. Strengthen server security: improve server security by upgrading the operating system, software and other means to reduce the possibility of being attacked. 6. Using CDN technology: through CDN technology, the content of the website is distributed to multiple servers to achieve content acceleration and load balancing, and it also has the ability to resist DDoS attacks. After a DDoS attack occurs, the following measures can be taken to restore the normal operation of the website: 1. Start the caching mechanism: enable the caching mechanism to cache the static content of the website on the CDN node to reduce the pressure on the back-end server. 2. Restore the backup: If the website backup is intact, you can restore the backup in time to restore the website to its original state as soon as possible. 3. Notify the ISP: Contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP) in time to request assistance in resolving the DDoS attack, so as to speed up the recovery of the website. In short, in order to quickly detect and defend against DDoS attacks, it is necessary to strengthen the security of the website, establish an effective defense mechanism, and detect and deal with abnormal traffic in a timely manner. After an attack, recovery measures should be taken quickly to restore the website to normal operation.
