intermittent 
months.  60  machines  (i.e.  31%  of  the  population) 
experienced no errors at all. 81 servers (i.e. 42%) reported 
between one and five errors, and so forth. Although most 
of the systems experienced a small number of errors, there  
were  five  servers  (i.e.  2.6%)  that  reported  over  1000 
errors.  Further  analysis  showed  that  fourteen  machines 
were  affected  by  intermittent  faults  in  the  memory 
subsystem. As an example, Fig. 4 gives the daily number 
of single-bit errors observed in one system. Errors reported 
in  the  first  six  months  of  the  study  were  attributed  to 
transient  faults.  The  first  large  burst  of  errors  was 
observed at the beginning of the seventh month, signaling 
the  possible  existence  of 
faults.  An 
intermittent  fault  occurred,  indeed,  in  the  tenth  month  of 
the study. After repair, about two months later, the stream 
of errors ceased. The source of the last two sets of errors, 
observed towards the end of the study, was not identified.  
    As  geometries  shrink  it  is  expected  that  process 
variations  will  negatively  affect  the  dependability  of  the 
interconnect.  Varying etch rates may modify the profile of 
the wire cross-section. At the same time, the thickness of 
the metallic and dielectric layers may change over the die 
surface.  As  a  result,  electromigration  will  be  able  to 
produce  opens  in  the  narrower  sections  of  the  wires. 
Similarly,  shorts may occur between adjacent or crossing 
conductors,  in  the  areas  where  the  dielectric  layer  is 
thinner.  It  is  likely  that  opens  and  shorts  will  initially 
manifest  as  intermittent  faults.  In  addition,  leakage  may 
occur due to direct tunneling of the current through oxide 
layers that are only a few atoms thick. Last but not least, 
very  small  amounts  of  manufacturing  residuals,  which 
were  well  tolerated  by  previous  processes,  may  lead  to 
intermittent  contacts  in  the  case  of  deep  submicron 
circuits. 
3. Case studies  
      The  following  two  case  studies  provide  examples  of 
intermittent  and  transient  faults  experienced  by  VLSI 
circuits. Failure analysis briefs are included.  
3.1. Case study A 
      Large  numbers  of  corrected  single-bit  errors  were 
observed  in  about  1%  of  the systems equipped with a 
particular  controller.  Sample  units  were  selected  at 
random,  for  failure  analysis.  First,  test  vectors were used 
to  stimulate 
the  parts  and  collect  electrical  data. 
Measurements  suggested  a  speed  path  failure  mode, 
similar to what would be observed if a signal path became 
resistive.  Next,  suspected  metal  nodes  were  inspected  by 
scanning  electron  microscopy.  It  was  observed  that  a  via 
was smaller and had an abnormal signature. The last step 
of the failure analysis consisted of focused ion beam cross 
section of the suspected via. Partial metal separation and  a 
ring  of  resistive  material  were  found.  Further  analysis 
showed  excessive  polymer  hardening  during  plasma 
etching.  As  a  result  the  deposition  removal  process 
couldn’t  completely  eliminate 
the 
residuals created an intermittent contact. 
     Single-bit errors induced by this intermittent fault were 
corrected by ECC. Had the failed via been part of a control 
path SDC would have likely occurred. In the case of very 
narrow  interconnects,  e.g.  <  0.1  µm,  an  extremely  small 
amount  of  residuals  will  be  sufficient  to  create  such 
intermittent contacts and possibly corrupt data. 
3.2. Case study B 
    Ten systems, suspected of   experiencing   single   and 
multi-bit errors, were subjected to  an  environmental  test, 
also  known  as  the  four  corners  test.  The  test,  devised  to 
accelerate  the  occurrence  of  errors,  consisted  of  varying 
the temperature in the –10oC to 70oC range and the power 
supply voltages from  nominal values to –5%, -6%, -10%, 
+5%,  +6%  and  +10%  of  the  nominal.  A  version  of  the 
Linpack  benchmark  was  executed.  Specifically,    the 
benchmark  was  designed  to  verify  the  correctness  of  the 
matrix computations, by deriving the residues, and log the 
errors.  In  this  way  the  occurrence  of  SDC  could  be 
detected. Nine out of the ten systems which underwent the 
test  experienced  SDC.  Out  of  a  total  of  148  errors  134 
were SDC (90.5%). 14 errors (9.5%) propagated and were 
detected at the system level. Failure analysis showed that a 
VLSI  circuit  experienced  clock  failures  and  setup/hold 
time  violations.  These  timing  violations  were  responsible 
for multi-bit data errors, especially during write cycles. It 
is  also  important  to  stress  that  errors  occurred  in  bursts, 
most of the time. Bursts of errors are particularly difficult 
to  handle,  as  the  recovery  from  the  first  event  can  be 
interrupted by the subsequent errors. 
4. Conclusions 
    Dependability  of  COTS  VLSI  circuits  is  becoming 
paramount as these devices are increasingly used in high-
confidence  and  even  life-critical  systems.  Semiconductor 
technology  advances  have  tremendously  increased  the 
performance of computing systems over the past decades. 
However, shrinking geometries, lower power voltages and 
higher 
impact  on 
dependability  by  increasing  the  rates  of  occurrence  of 
transient  and  intermittent  faults.  These  faults  are  also 
capable of silently corrupting data. 
    The  analysis  of  the  main  trends  in  deep  submicron 
technology  shows  that  particle  induced  transients  will

timing  violations. 
remain a major source of soft errors. Alpha particles will 
dominate  this  class  of  faults.  Multi-bit  errors  are  more 
likely  to  occur,  as  both  junction  size  and  critical  charge 
continue to decrease. It is predicted that the impact of the 
interconnect  on  circuit  dependability  will  significantly 
increase.  Smaller  features  and  modified  wire  cross-
sections,  as  well  as  higher  frequencies,  will  raise  the 
likelihood  of 
faults, 
generated  by  process  variations  and  manufacturing 
residuals,  are  going  to  represent  another  major  source  of 
errors in deep submicron circuits.  As a result, we consider 
that semiconductor industry is approaching a new stage in 
the  development  and  manufacturing  of  VLSI  circuits. 
Design  techniques  and  process  technologies  will  not  be 
able to fully control the rates of occurrence of the transient 
and  intermittent  faults.  Architectural  solutions,  presently 
employed by custom designed fault-tolerant systems, will 
have  to  be  embedded  into  COTS  VLSI  circuits,  and 
especially  into  microprocessors,  in  the  future.  It  is 
expected  that    enhanced  concurrent  error  detection  and 
correction,  time  and  space  redundancy,  even  triplication 
and  voting,  will  be commonly used by VLSI systems for 
providing  better  fault/error  handling  and  preserve  data 
integrity.  Field  data  collection,  failure  analysis,  and  fault 
injection  will  play  a  leading  role  in  understanding  new 
failure modes and error propagation. Failure prediction is 
expected  to  be  a  central  research  topic,  as the number of 
errors induced by intermittent faults increases. Improving 
dependability  of  VLSI  circuits  will  also  require  better 
modeling  tools,  devised  to  capture  the  behavior  of 
transient and intermittent faults.
