-Neutrons, discovered in 1930,
are responsible for isotopes
of elements with differing
mass
-Fissile isotopes split when 
bombarded by neutrons;
U-235, Pu-239 are important
regarding proliferation
-A critical mass can sustain a 
reaction, critical assembly makes
a very dense softball into a 
“physics package”(euphemism!)
