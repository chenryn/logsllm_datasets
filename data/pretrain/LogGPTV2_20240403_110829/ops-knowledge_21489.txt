User: I am trying to using os.system function to call command 'history'
but the stdout just show that 'sh :1  history: not found'
Other example i.e. os.system('ls') is works. Can anyone can tell me why 'history' does not work, and how to call 'history' command in Python script.
Assistant: history is not an executable file, but a built-in bash command. You can't run it with os.system.
