User: I want to be able to scan a network of servers and match IP addresses to hostnames. 
I saw a lot of questions about this (with a lot of down votes), but none are exactly what I'm looking for.
So I've tried python's socket library socket.gethostbyaddr(ip). But this only returns results if I have a DNS setup or the IP-to-host mapping is in my hosts file.
I want to be able to ask a machine for their hostname, rather than querying DNS.
How can a query a Linux machine for their hostname? 
Preferably using python or bash, but other ways are good too.
Assistant: You can remotely execute the command hostname command on these machines to acquire the Hostname
