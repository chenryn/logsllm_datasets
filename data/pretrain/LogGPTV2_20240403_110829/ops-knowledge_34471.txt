User: I have installed the Python IDE Spyder. For me it's a great development environment.
Some how in this process I have managed to install three versions of Python on my system.These can be located as following:

Version 2.7.6 from the OS X Terminal;
Version 2.7.8 from the Spyder Console; and
Version 2.7.9rc1 from an IDL window.

The problem I have is (I think) that the multiple versions are preventing Spyder from working correctly.
So how do I confirm that 2.7.6 is the latest version supported by Apple and is there a simple way ('silver bullet') to remove other versions from my system.
I hope this is the correct forum for this question. If not I would appreciate suggestions where I could go for help. 

I want to keep my life simple and to develop python software in the Spyder IDE. I am not an OS X guru and I really don't want to get into a heavy duty command line action. To that end I just want to delete/uninstall the 'unofficial versions' of Python. Surely there must be an easy way to do this - perhaps 'pip uninstall Python-2.7.9rc1' or some such. The problem is that I am hesitant to try this due to the fear that it will crash my system.
Help on this would be greatly appreciated.
Assistant: (Spyder dev here) There is no simple way to do what you ask for, at least for the Python version that comes with Spyder.
I imagine you downloaded and installed our DMG package. That package comes with its own Python version as part of the application (along with several important scientific packages), so it can't be removed because that would imply to remove Spyder itself :-)
I don't know how you installed IDL(E?), so I can't advise you on how to remove it.
