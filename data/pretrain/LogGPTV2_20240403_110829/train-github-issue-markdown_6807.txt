I understand that there are existing discussions on this topic, but they have all been closed. I reviewed the solution proposed in issue #3159, which would have been acceptable for my use case. However, my investigation revealed that Next.js is no longer utilizing the plugin, and as a result, there is currently no way to disable the clearing functionality.

Given that this feature has been integrated directly into Next.js, shouldn't there be an option in the `next.config.js` file to enable or disable this behavior?
