I know there are already issues about it but they are all closed. I checked
out the solution in this issue #3159 â€” which would have been ok for me to use.
But my investigation showed that next-js is actually not using the plugin
anymore, hence atm there is not way of disabling the clearing at all.
Shouldn't there be an option in the next-js-config now since you implemented
this feature into next-js itself?
