Why is this important?
Scnenarios
● “The sprayers are programmed by the 
hacker to unevenly spray the 
chemicals on the crops, applying 
ten times the chemical on certain 
parts of the field, and a tenth the 
dose on other parts.”
Skewed risks
● Denial of Service BIG impact
● “hacker uploads a firmware update 
that inserts an offset into the GPS 
locations used by the target.”
Real threats
● “offset of (say) 100 yards North of 
where it should be. The target 
navigates itself onto a highway, 
into a river, through a fence, over 
a cliff, or whatever. Target is 
destroyed,”

More Real threats

Why did we even look at Ag?
Nobody else was.

What does 
the data 
do?
“Trade Secrets”
● “Does sharing data with data 
analytic providers destroy its 
secrecy?”
● “{I think the answer is probably 
“no,” provided sharing is done 
anonymously.”
