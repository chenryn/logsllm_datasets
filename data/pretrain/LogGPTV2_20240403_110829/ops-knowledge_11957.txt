User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Is it safe to log into crypto exchange account using coworking space or coffee shop wifi network? I day trade cryptocurrency and want to start using coworking spaces for faster internet access. 

1.a. Is it safe to log into my exchange account using the coworking space network?

1.b. What questions should I ask them about their network's security [to make sure other people on the network cannot access my data]?

Sometimes I go to a coffee shop but never log into my account because I have read that hackers can intercept my data and can potentially steal login details. 

2.a. Can it ever be safe to use a coffee shop, or for that matter hotel and guest house wifi? What if I use a VPN such as Kaspersky's secure connection?

Assistant: 1.a. No. Any shared network that you do not control exposes risks.

1.b. Practically, I doubt any question will solve the reality of 1.a.

2.a. See 1.a.

VPNs are exactly the tool for this problem. They create a secure tunnel out of and through untrusted networks. We cannot speculate on the security of any one product or service, although paid options are more likely (caveat emptor) to provide you with better security.
