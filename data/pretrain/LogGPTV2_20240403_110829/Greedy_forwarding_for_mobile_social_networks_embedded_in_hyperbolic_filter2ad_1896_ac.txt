by switching on and off the hubs of the network more often than the rest of the nodes. Finally, the navigability 
of some real networks, like the Internet and the WTW, remains extremely high in the temporal maps. In fact, 
time-varying effects increase even more the high success rate associated to the static maps, at the cost of a very 
small increase in the stretch, slowly growing with T, a feature that we name ultranavigability. Even more, temporal 
changes in the structure of these networks increase the success even if the activation probability is very low. At 
the same time, the high routing success observed in these networks could be due in part to temporal behavior 
in the system, although this possibility has not been acknowledged before and all the merit for their navigability 
properties has been accredited to their static architecture.
Our work sets a first attempt to measure the effects of temporal dynamics on the navigability of real net-
works. It has been increasingly recognized, indeed, that networks are dynamic entities that evolve in time, with 
connections being established and terminated for different reasons. This study paves the way towards a better 
understanding of the role of the network’s temporal dimension in navigation processes, and provides hints for 
developing better routing strategies exploiting such dynamics. Further research is in order to extend our results. 
One may consider more sophisticated generative models of temporal networks, that may, for instance, incorpo-
rate a bursty dynamics of links or nodes.
Methods
Empirical data.  Here we give a brief description of the five networks considered in our study and source 
references for their data. In Table 1, we report the values of different metrics for the five networks. Notice that we 
used the giant connected component in all cases.
ArXiv.  The ArXiv network is a graph representing co-authorship of papers38, elaborated from data of the free sci-
entific repository ArXiv. The nodes are authors which are connected if they have co-authored a paper belonging to 
category “Disordered Systems and Neural Networks” (cond-mat.disnn). The data considers only papers from up to May 
2014, with the word “networks” in the title or abstract. The hyperbolic embedding of this network comes from ref.39.
US Commodities.  The commodities network40 is a representation of the flows of services and goods (in USD) 
exchanged between industrial sectors during year 2007 in the United States. The hyperbolic embedding of this 
network comes from ref.41.
Metabolic.  The metabolic network used in this study corresponds to the one-mode projection of metabolites of 
the bipartite metabolic network of the bacterium E. coli. In this representation, two metabolites are connected if 
they participate in the same biochemical reaction. We use the data originally extracted from the BiGG database42 
and reconstructed in43 as a spatially embedded network.
Internet.  We use the connectivity data for the Internet at the autonomous systems level collected by the 
Archipelago project44 corresponding to June 2009 and reconstructed as a network embedded in hyperbolic space 
in ref.11.
WTW.  The world trade web consists of significant trade exchanges between countries. We use the network cor-
responding to the most recent data available, the year 2013, and its embedding as given in ref.45.
Hyperbolic maps. 
In the hyperbolic hidden metric space, every node i has coordinates (ri, θi). Embedding 
a network in a metric space means constructing a map that correlates topology and geometry. The idea is that a 
link between two nodes in the topology exists with a certain probability p(d) that depends on their distance d,

positioned in the geometric space9. Therefore, p(d) needs to be a decreasing function of distance between nodes. 
In the hyperbolic plane, the distance between nodes dij is calculated using the hyperbolic law of cosines:

It has repeatedly been shown that real networks can be embedded into a hyperbolic plane11,43, in a way that 
all relevant topological properties of the networks, such as the small world property, the degree distribution, 
degree-degree correlations, the clustering coefficient, and degree-thresholding topological self-similarity9 are 
reproduced by the model.
