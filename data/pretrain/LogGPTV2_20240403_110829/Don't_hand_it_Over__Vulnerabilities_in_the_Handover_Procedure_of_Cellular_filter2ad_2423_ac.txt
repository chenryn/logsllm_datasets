handover procedure, but also on avoiding easy detection. First, we
define all possible handover cases that an attacker should take into
consideration while preparing for the attack. Then, we specify the
necessary steps to complete the attack.
4.1 Defining the Handover Cases
In Sections 2.1 & 2.2, we described the types of handover and clar-
ified in which each handover can be classified according to its
relocation, radio access technology, etc. In this section, we go one
step further and determine the concrete cases resulting from the
classification. An attacker can make use of these cases to have
a better understanding of the victim network. Thus, by putting
the classification into practice, beginning from the latest radio ac-
cess technology to the earliest, we identify the primary Inter-Base
station handover cases as presented by Table 1.
Moreover, the selection of interface that is based on the Core
Network’s involvement during the handover is essential. If a direct
communication between the source and target base station can be
utilized (X2 in LTE and Xn in 5G), then the Core Network will not
be involved. However, when a direct connection is not enabled (or
due to failures or Inter-AMF/MME handovers), the authentication
and mobility management entity of the Core Network must manage
the handover. Therefore, base stations must communicate through
the authentication and mobility management entity (S1 in LTE, N2
in 5G). Figure 5 shows very briefly how the interface decision is
made based on the specifications [2, 7, 10, 14]; Figure 1 illustrates
the established interfaces between network entities in LTE and 5G.
Finally, apart from the Intra-Base Station handovers that belong
to another distinct category, we also take into account the condi-
tional and the Intra/Inter-DU handovers from Section 2.2 that may
apply to either Intra- or Inter-Base station handovers.
4.2 Attack Steps
1. Initial Reconnaissance. Gathering sufficient intelligence in the
cellular environment is possible through passive sniffers that collect
broadcast messages as well as UE traffic. An attacker that aims to
exploit the handover procedure must be able to capture the MIB and
SIB messages of the network (e. g., using inexpensive hardware like
USRPs). An additional way to boost network scanning is to use the
publicly available IMSI-catcher detection applications. Thus, an at-
tacker may utilize his/her smartphone device to collect data related
to nearby legitimate stations and use them to configure a rogue
base station, thus reversing the applications’ intended purpose.
2. Determining the Network Structure. Knowledge about the
network composition allows to choose the most suitable target to at-
tack. Thus, through the collected traces the attacker is able to locate
the legitimate base stations and determine their parameters. To cre-
ate an adequate representation of the network structure we deem
important to use the location, Cell Identifier, Tracking Area Iden-
tity (TAI) which includes the Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile
903Don’t hand it Over: Vulnerabilities in the Handover Procedure of Cellular Telecommunications
ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Network Code (MNC) and Tracking Area Code (TAC), Absolute
Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN), the associated oper-
ators/providers and the supported services like 5G and LTE for
each available base station. The attacker may continuously scan
the network for configuration changes in order to remain updated.
3. Selecting the Target. Given sufficient information about the
network, the attacker can decide which base station to imitate.
We separate this process into three phases. Since the attacker’s
objective is to lure UE victims to connect to a rogue base station
and disconnect them from their source/serving base station, as a
first phase, the attacker will determine which source/serving base
station and cell to impact. Second, the attacker will construct its po-
tential neighboring list based on the obtained network data. To form
a more accurate neighboring list the attacker may also leverage
his/her malicious UE to participate in one or multiple UE-assisted
Automatic Neighbor Relation (ANR) processes, which is a feature
of the Self-Organising Networks [10, 15]. Finally, the attacker will
choose to emulate a base station that is included in the estimated
neighboring list of the serving base station. The benefit of prefer-
ring a base station from this neighboring list is that the adversary
uses a legitimate base station with right parameters and close-to
correct location. Alternatively, invalid parameters like wrong Cell
Ids, excessive X2/Xn connections and abnormal locations may ham-
per the handover attack. In such a case, either the source/serving
base station will not be able to complete the preparation phase of
the handover or detection becomes easier.
4. Configuring the False Base Station. Before executing any
handover attack the adversary needs to set up his/her base station
correctly. The false base station should be able to replay the latest
MIB and SIB messages of the emulated station and cell. Nonetheless,
replaying just the broadcast messages is not enough. In fact, the
attacker must configure the malicious base station appropriately
based on the Cell Identifier, TAI, dl_ARFCN (downlink), PRACH
Root Sequence Index and type of service.
Then, the attacker will gradually increase the signal power of
his/her station to "attract" the UEs and force them to report bogus
measurements to the network. If these false measurements even-
tually succeed in triggering a handover event, then the attacker
can cease increasing the signal power and focus on the handover
exploitation itself. Finally, the false base station should also have
the capability to normally interact with the victim UEs meaning
that it should be able to receive and respond to RACH, RRC and
NAS messages using open or closed source software.
5. Handover Exploitation. The attacker’s decision on selecting
the most convenient base station to mimic determines also the
handover cases that he/she can exploit. For instance, the choice
to mimic a legitimate LTE eNodeB limits the exploited cases to
the LTE domain for Intra/Inter Base station handovers. Of course,
a more powerful attacker could leverage more false base stations
covering multiple services and generations, thus increasing the
number of affected handover cases and the impact. Nevertheless, it
is prudent for the attacker to always pay attention to unsupported
services, since they can expose him/her to the operator.
In our work, we provide evidence that the defined cases in Sec-
tion 4.1 are vulnerable. All of them share the same security weak-
nesses; thus an attacker that adheres to the aforementioned at-
tacking methodology can potentially launch successful handover
attacks. The attacker’s main objective is to make UEs attach to
his/her malicious cell with detrimental results. The next sections
cover the vulnerabilities and the handover exploitation comprehen-
sively.
4.3 Identifying the Vulnerabilities
We next explore the handover security flaws and deficiencies based
on the specifications. Our approach is sequential, starting from the
pre-handover, concluding with post-handover weaknesses. In addi-
tion, vulnerabilities A to D are mainly inherent to the specifications,
whereas E and F are primarily operator-specific.
A. Insecure Broadcast Messages: The SIBs and MIB of a base
station that are necessary for the UEs in order to connect to the
network are broadcasted without encryption, integrity-protection,
and authentication. As a consequence, anyone with the proper
equipment can intercept and replay broadcasted traffic related to
legitimate base stations. The lack of a Public Key Infrastructure
scheme [30] that could be used to sign these messages gives the
attacker the chance to setup a false base station and exploit the
handover procedure.
B. Unverified Measurement Reports: MRs include signal infor-
mation of nearby stations. These measurements are evaluated by
the source/serving base station to determine if a handover is re-
quired. Even though the MR is an RRC message protected by the
AS security context, its content is never verified by the network.
To be precise, the source base station is unable to detect abnormal
values in the measurement report meaning that in case of false
Cell Identifiers, incorrect Tracking Area Codes, incorrect PLMNs,
unsupported services, and wrong network topology, the source
base station will still accept the MR. Consequently, a malicious
handover remains undetected during the handover decision at the
preparation phase. Furthermore, the MR lacks extra values that
could be used for security purposes, such as MIB/SIB hashes and
location coordinates.
C. Missing Cross-Validation in Preparation Phase: The prepa-
ration phase incorporates also the communication between the
source and the target base station that is needed to arrange the
handover. This can either be fulfilled through a direct channel in-
terface or through a Core Network interface. However, regardless
of the interface, the procedure lacks a cross-validation of the values
included in the MR. In fact, there is no way for the the target base
station to verify if the handover derives from itself (a legitimate
entity). Instead, the source base station immediately sends the Han-
dover Request (or Handover Required) and the target base station
goes through the process of admission control. A cross-validation
mechanism could be used to detect inconsistencies in the values
reported by the UE compared to the real values of the target base
station, mostly if extra security values are going to be included in
the MR.
D. RACH Initiation without Verification: Once the preparation
phase is completed, the source base station immediately instructs
the UE to connect to the target base station by sending the RRC
Connection Reconfiguration message. The UE blindly initiates the
RACH procedure and attempts to send the RRC Connection Re-
configuration Complete to finalise the new attachment. These mes-
sages that belong to the execution phase can lead to malicious
904ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA

attachments since the UE’s perspective of the target base station
is different from the network’s. Therefore, besides of the unsub-
stantiated measurement reports, the problem is amplified by the
fact that the network has the tendency to trust the UE without ac-
knowledgements or supervision. In addition, the RRC Connection
Reconfigurations are not designed to inform the UE that the target
base station is legitimate.
E. Missing Recovery Mechanisms: The network functions lack a
proper recovery mechanism so the UE can safely connect back to the
legitimate base station in case of a failure. When a UE is maliciously
camped, it periodically tries to reconnect to the network through
the rogue base station using the RRC Connection Reestablishment
messages, Service Requests and Attach requests. This means that
in cases of failure, the UE is not intended to validate its serving
base station. Hence, the real network can only wait for the UE
to reconnect and rely on its post-failure Radio Link Failure (RLF)
reports. On top of that, the malicious base station has the ability to
ignore, reject or forward messages to the legitimate network when
the UE attempts to reconnect.
F. Difficulty of Distinguishing Network Failures from Atta
-cks: Finally, the specifications do not include any dynamic post-
detection mechanism that would leverage the network topology, its
configurations, the UE RLF and measurement reports, missing RRC
and NAS responses and network failures (X2/Xn connection errors,
timer error, etc) in order to reveal potential malicious activities. In
fact, the network is not sufficiently designed to distinguish failures
caused by security issues from prevalent network causes. Therefore,
it incorrectly invokes regular recovery and optimization functions
(e. g. OAM) to solve security issues, which may lead to additional
damages.
5 EXPLOITING THE HANDOVER
Dependence on measurement reports and signal strength started
from the early legacy technologies with 2G and 3G [1, 10, 13],
meaning that the problem is not new and remains unmitigated.
Surprisingly, not only LTE, but also 5G is affected even though it
is considered more secure. In this section, we present our findings
