### Figure 6: Survival Probability of Source Infections

Figure 6 illustrates the survival probability of the 26,673 source infections observed throughout the entire study period. When measuring infection lifetimes, it is common to encounter "censored" data pointsâ€”these are infections that have not been remedied by the end of the observation period. In our dataset, 1,178 source infections were still actively redirecting at the end of data collection and are thus considered censored. Survival analysis can account for such incomplete data by constructing an estimated probability distribution that incorporates censored data points. The survival probability in Figure 6 is calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator [13].

### Figure 5: Search Result Distribution by Category

Figure 5 shows the percentage of search results per category based on the type of query. Active redirections dominate the results, regardless of the query's intent.

### Progress in Defending Against Search-Redirection Attacks

This section examines the progress made by defenders (such as search engines) in combating search-redirection attacks. We now explicitly analyze the evolving interplay between those perpetrating these attacks and those working to stop them.

### Conditions for Successful Search-Redirection Attacks

Several conditions must be met simultaneously for a search-redirection attack to succeed:
1. The source infection must appear in the search results for popular queries.
2. The infection must remain active on the website appearing in the results.
3. Any intermediate traffic brokers must stay operational.
4. The destination website must remain online.

Defenders can disrupt any of these components to counter the attacks. In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of defenses against each component of the attack infrastructure, starting with the persistence of source infections over time, followed by traffic brokers and destinations.

### 6.1 Cleaning Up Source Infections

A key measure of defense is the duration for which source infections persist in search results and continue redirecting traffic. We calculate the survival time of a source infection as the number of days from when a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) is first observed to be actively redirecting to different domains until it is last observed doing so.

#### Figure 7: Source Infection Cleanup Analysis

- **Top:** Median time (in days) to clean up source infections over time.
- **Middle:** Number of source infections per 100 search results over time.
- **Bottom:** Median time (in days) to clean up source infections by TLD.

From the figure, it is evident that many infections are short-lived. One-third last five days or less, while the median survival time for infections is 19 days. However, some infections persist for a very long time: 17% last at least six months, and 8% survive for more than one year. Additionally, 459 websites (1.7% of the total) remain infected for at least two years. Thus, while most infections are addressed promptly, a minority persist for much longer.

We next investigate how the time required to clean up source infections has changed over time. We computed a survival function for each month from April 2010 to March 2013, including all source infections first identified in that month. To ensure consistency across months, we censored any observed survival time greater than 180 days.

**Figure 7 (top)** reports the median survival time (in days) for each monthly period. The median time is highly volatile, ranging from 42 days in April 2010 to 2 days in June 2012. However, the overall trend is downward, as indicated by the best-fit orange dotted line. It appears that the median time to clean up source infections has decreased by around 10 days over three years.

While this trend is positive, we wondered about its impact on the attacker's strategy. Shorter-lived source infections could lead attackers to compromise more websites. **Figure 7 (middle)** plots the number of source infections per 100 search results observed each month. We observe a strongly positive effect: while the number of infected FQDNs hovered around 1 per 100 search results in 2010 and early 2011, observed infections increased substantially beginning in late 2011, reaching nearly 4 infections per 100 search results by late 2012, before declining somewhat. This suggests that any crackdown on cleaning up source infections has been matched by an uptick in new infections, explaining the increase in the percentage of search results that redirect, as shown in Section 5.

**Figure 7 (bottom)** examines how cleanup times have changed for source infections on different top-level domains (TLDs). In our earlier work [15], we found that .edu websites remained infected for much longer than others, and that .org and .com were cleaned more quickly. The figure shows that .com websites (denoted by the long dashed brown line) closely follow the overall trends in cleanup times. Notably, .edu websites (indicated by the dashed green line) went from considerably above-average survival times in 2010 to following the average by mid-2011. However, .org websites began to lag behind starting in mid-2011, suggesting that attackers may have shifted to targeting .org websites once .edu websites started to be cleaned up.

### 6.2 Cleaning Up Traffic Brokers and Destinations

Source infections are not the only hosts that can be targeted by defenders. Traffic brokers and destinations can also be shut down. We now compare the survival times of these to source infections.

#### Figure 8: Survival Times for Source Infections, Traffic Brokers, and Destinations

- **Top:** Survival probability for source infections, traffic brokers, and destinations over the entire study period.
- **Bottom:** Median time in days (survival time) to clean up source infections, traffic brokers, and destinations.

The graph shows that source infections are removed fastest, followed by destinations and traffic brokers. For example, 43% of sources are removed within three weeks, compared to 29% of traffic brokers and 36% of destinations. The median survival time for source infections is 34 days, compared to 59 days for destinations and 86 days for traffic brokers. While the median traffic broker performs worst, the story changes slightly in the tail of the distribution: the 20% longest-lived source infections survive at least 6 months, compared to 9 months for traffic brokers and 11 months for destinations.

**Figure 8 (bottom)** tracks how the median survival time changes over time for source infections, traffic brokers, and destinations. The median times are calculated quarterly due to the smaller number of traffic brokers and destinations compared to sources. We see a slow but steady improvement in reduced survival times for source infections. However, there is much greater fluctuation for the survival times of traffic brokers and destinations. For some quarters, the median time is around 5 months, whereas in others, it follows more closely the survival times of sources. Notably, the survival times of traffic brokers and destinations are positively correlated.

We conclude that traffic brokers and destinations have not received the same levels of pressure from defenders as source infections. This is reflected in the longer survival times and the smaller number of domains ultimately used.

### Where Are Traffic Brokers Hosted?

To understand where traffic brokers are hosted, we looked up the autonomous system (AS) each traffic broker belongs to. Only 7 ASes (3 in the US, 3 in Germany, 1 in the Netherlands) support more than 10 traffic brokers every day. **Figure 9** plots the number of redirection chains supported by brokers belonging to these 7 ASes as a function of time. None of these ASes provide "bulletproof hosting." In fact, US1 is a known cloud-service provider. Some time in 2013, US1 decided to shut down these brokers that had been using their service for more than a year. Some of them consequently shifted to NL, but what is most striking is the high concentration of traffic brokers over a few autonomous systems, especially since mid-2012. Coordinated takedowns among these ASes could be a promising avenue for intervention.

### 7. Advertising Network

We next delve into a deeper discussion of the redirection chains involved in search-redirection attacks. Redirection chains can yield valuable insights into the "advertising network" used by criminals to peddle their products. We focus on interval T3, as Datasets 1 and 2 do not contain enough information to extract the relevant details. In the remainder of this section, we always look at traffic brokers and pharmacies at the fully-qualified domain name level.

#### Source Infections to Traffic Brokers

On average, over 95% of the source infections on a given day actually work; that is, less than 5% fail to take the visitor to a questionable site, instead landing on a parking page.

- **Direct to Pharmacy:** About a quarter (25.1%) of these source infections send traffic directly to a pharmacy without any intermediate traffic broker.
- **Dedicated Brokers:** Another 42.8% use dedicated brokers that only get traffic from a single infection.
- **Shared Brokers:** On average, about 14.8% of source infections send traffic to a broker shared with other source infections. Such brokers, on average, send traffic to 2.4 different pharmacies.

#### Traffic Broker Characteristics (Table 4)

- **Single Pharmacy:** 61.1% of brokers drive traffic to a single pharmacy, receiving traffic from 18.9 infected URLs on average.
- **Multiple Pharmacies:** 33.8% of brokers redirect to multiple pharmacies, and receive traffic from 11.8 URLs on average.
- **Other Brokers:** Only 5.2% of traffic brokers send traffic to other traffic brokers.

#### Pharmacies (Table 5)

- **No Broker:** 56% of pharmacies do not rely on any broker and get their traffic, on average, from 4.6 infected URLs.
- **Dedicated Broker:** 17.8% of all pharmacies get traffic from a dedicated broker, which feeds them traffic coming from about 24.2 distinct infected URLs.
- **Shared Broker:** Slightly less than a third of all pharmacies use a shared traffic broker, which, interestingly, forwards traffic from only 5.2 infected URLs. Dedicated traffic brokers appear to drive considerably more traffic than "co-hosted" solutions using shared traffic brokers. This suggests that "advertising networks" (e.g., pharmaceutical affiliates) are highly heterogeneous, with actors ranging from powerful "dedicated" brokers to others operating on a shoestring budget. The high proportion of pharmacies directly linked to infections, without a traffic broker, can be explained by the difficulty in maintaining a dedicated broker.
