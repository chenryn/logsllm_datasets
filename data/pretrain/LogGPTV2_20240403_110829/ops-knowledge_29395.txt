User:  What is CI/CD, and its role in the software development cycle?
Assistant: CI/CD refers to continuous integration (Continuous Integration) and continuous delivery/deployment (Continuous Delivery/Deployment), which is a software development process. Its purpose is to automate the software development, testing and deployment process to achieve fast, efficient and reliable software delivery. In CI/CD, developers frequently submit code to software warehouses and use automated tools to build, test, and deploy, and each code change will be integrated and tested. This can speed up software delivery, gradually reduce operation and maintenance and testing costs, and improve software quality and reliability. In the software development cycle, CI/CD plays an extremely important role, helping to realize the concept of agile development and DevOps.
