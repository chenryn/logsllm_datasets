**Title: Cloud-Native Sandboxes for Microservices: Understanding New Threats and Attacks**

Sandboxing is a well-established technique for detecting malware and targeted attacks. In practice, sandboxes analyze network traffic and identify suspicious behaviors. However, the emergence of new forms of malware and exploits specifically targeting microservices presents significant challenges for traditional sandboxing solutions in cloud-native environments. 

Contemporary sandboxes often lack support for container-based environments, which are essential in modern cloud-native architectures. To address these challenges, we have redesigned our sandboxing system to leverage emerging container technologies. This updated system is better equipped to detect and mitigate microservice-oriented attacks.

In this presentation, we will demonstrate how our redesigned sandbox improves the performance of detecting microservice-specific threats. Additionally, we will discuss how to integrate our sandbox with existing security products to enhance overall accuracy and effectiveness.

### Key Points:
- **Introduction to Sandboxing:** Overview of how sandboxes work and their role in detecting malware.
- **Challenges in Cloud-Native Environments:** Discussion of the limitations of traditional sandboxes in containerized settings.
- **Redesigned Sandbox System:** Explanation of the new design that leverages container technologies.
- **Performance Improvements:** Demonstration of enhanced detection capabilities for microservice-oriented attacks.
- **Integration with Security Products:** Strategies for extending the sandbox to complement and improve existing security solutions.

By adopting these advancements, organizations can better protect their microservices from emerging threats and ensure a more secure cloud-native environment.
