Sandboxing is a proven technique for detecting malware and targeted attacks. In practice, sandboxes inspect network traffic and identify the suspicious behaviors. However, the emergence of new forms of malware and exploits targeting microservices pose challenges for traditional sandboxing solutions in cloud-native environments.Contemporary sandboxes fail to support container-based environments. To address these challenges, we redesigned the sandboxing system by adopting the new emerging container techniques. We will also demonstrate how our sandbox improves the performance of detecting miscroservice-oriented attacks. Additionally, in this talk we will discuss how to extend our sandbox to benefit existing security products in order to achieve better accuracy.
