It appears that you are trying to define a constant `GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE` and use it to specify the length of arrays within a struct in Rust. However, the syntax you are using is not correct for Rust. In Rust, you need to use a fixed-size array, and the size must be a constant known at compile time.

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```rust
const GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE: usize = 256;

#[repr(C)]
struct GLFWgammaramp {
    red: [u16; GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE],   // unsigned short red[GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE];
    green: [u16; GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE], // unsigned short green[GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE];
    blue: [u16; GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE],  // unsigned short blue[GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE];
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Constant Definition**:
   - `const GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE: usize = 256;` defines a constant `GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE` with the value `256`. The type `usize` is used because it is the appropriate type for array lengths in Rust.

2. **Struct Definition**:
   - The `#[repr(C)]` attribute ensures that the struct has a C-compatible memory layout, which is important if you are interfacing with C code.
   - The arrays `red`, `green`, and `blue` are defined with the fixed size `GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE` using the syntax `[u16; GLFW_GAMMA_RAMP_SIZE]`.

This should resolve the error you encountered. The issue was not a bug but rather a misunderstanding of Rust's syntax for defining fixed-size arrays.
