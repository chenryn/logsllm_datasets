User: Please introduce the concepts of Docker containers and images, and explain the differences and connections between them.
Assistant: Docker is a lightweight virtualization technology whose basic concepts include containers and images. A container is the most basic running unit in Docker, which can be regarded as an independent process space, which contains all the resources required for running. Containers can be created, started, stopped, deleted, and migrated, and are characterized by lightweight, isolation, and portability. The image is the main distribution method of Docker. It is a static file that contains applications, library files, system tools, and configuration information that need to be run. It can be regarded as a basic template created for containers. The image can be built by itself through Docker Hub or other image centers and Dockerfile. The relationship between containers and images is that containers are created from images, and images can be called and shared by multiple containers. At the same time, the container can modify the image without affecting the original image and other containers. Therefore, applications can be deployed and migrated through mirroring, and applications can be isolated and run through containers. In short, a container is an entity at runtime, and an image is an entity at build time. The two work together to realize the encapsulation, distribution, and deployment of applications, and improve the development and operation efficiency of applications.
