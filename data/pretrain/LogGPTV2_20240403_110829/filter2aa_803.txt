  one	
  of	
  a	
  dozen	
  or	
  so	
  folks	
  starWng	
  a	
  group

  would	
  be	
  great	
  and	
  far	
  exceed	
  the	
  awesomeness	
  of	
  our	
local	
  2600	
  (or	
  so	
  I	
  thought)

  And	
  the	
  Years	
  Passed	
– most	
  acWve	
  groups

  doing	
  their

  thing	
– many	
  groups	
  looking	
  to	
  abandon	
  the	
  Defcon	
banner	
  in	
  favor	
  of	
  hackerspaces	
•  they	
  have	
  much	
  cooler	
  names	
– many	
  groups	
  simply	
  didn't	
  exist	
  or	
  respond

  with	
  a	
  list

  over	
  170+
