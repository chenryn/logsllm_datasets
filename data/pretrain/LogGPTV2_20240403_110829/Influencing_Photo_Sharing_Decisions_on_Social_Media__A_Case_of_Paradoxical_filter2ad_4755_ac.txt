shared an embarrassing photo of someone else you know?”).
The Stranger Photo Subscale included three questions and was
directed toward understanding users’ experiences posting pho-
tos of strangers and experiencing regret (e.g., “Have you ever
shared an embarrassing photo online of a stranger (someone
that you do not personally know)?”). Lastly, four questions
were used in the Familiar Posting Subscale to determine the
extent to which people in users’ networks posted embarrassing
photos of others (e.g., “Do people you know post photos
that might be embarrassing to other people?”). Answers were
recorded on a three-point scale, either “no,” “maybe,” or “yes.”
An additional Privacy Preference Question was administered,
which asked participants, “Are you a private person who keeps
to yourself or an open person who enjoys sharing with others
(1 = very private, 7 = very open)?” [60].
4) Procedure: All procedures were carried out in accor-
dance with a protocol approved by our institution’s ethics
review board for the protection of human subjects. After
providing informed consent, participants completed the Social
Media Usage Questionnaire. They then completed the experi-
mental task, which required them to view all 98 photos one-at-
a-time followed by a question that differed depending on the
condition (see Table I). In the case of the baseline condition,
there was no modiﬁcation to the question, “How likely are
you to share this photo on social media?”, but the question in
the PT and PP conditions was preceded by a phrase designed
to cue participants to think about their decision differently. In
the case of the PT condition, participants were cued to think
about how they would feel as the subject of each photo. In the
case of the PP condition, participants were cued to consider
the privacy of the photo subjects.
After answering questions for all photos, participants com-
pleted the Social Media Privacy Questionnaire, Privacy Pref-
erence Question, and demographic questions. These questions
were included at the end of the experiment to avoid privacy-
related cuing, other than those included in the experimental
manipulation. Participants were thanked for their time and
compensated for completing the online experiment. Each par-
ticipant was paid $3 and the average time to complete the
survey was approximately 24 minutes.
IV. RESULTS
In addition to experimental condition (Baseline, Perspective
Taking, Privacy Perspective), there were three additional in-
dependent variables assessed in this study. Perceived valence
of the photos was derived from Study 1 and included very
negative, negative, positive, and very positive valences. History
of photo sharing was based on how often participants reported
posting photos on social media: Participants were assigned to
‘low’ (N = 110), ‘medium’ (N = 111), or ‘high’ (N = 158)
photo-sharing groups. The ﬁnal variable was the gender of the
participants.
A 2 (gender) × 3 (condition) × 3 (photo-sharing frequency)
× 4 (photo valence) mixed-design ANOVA was conducted
with the ﬁrst three factors as between-subjects variables and
the last factor as a within-subjects variable. The likelihood of
sharing photos was the dependent measure. Age was added
as a covariate because of its association with photo-sharing
frequency (r(379) = −.15, p = 0.005); older participants
demonstrated less likelihood to share photos than younger
participants. The inclusion of age as a covariate controlled
for the possibility that age rather than sharing frequency
moderated the likelihood of sharing in the experiment.
We report all ﬁndings in Appendix A, however, the key
ﬁndings are outlined below. First, the main effects of condition
and photo-sharing frequency were signiﬁcantly related to shar-
ing scores. Age was also a signiﬁcant covariate of likelihood
to share (as reported above) and signiﬁcantly interacted with
photo valence to predict sharing likelihood. There were ad-
ditional two-way interactions between condition and valence,
photo-sharing frequency and valence, as well as gender and
valence. All other main effects and interactions were non-
signiﬁcant, ps> 0.05.
A. Condition Effect on Likelihood to Share
Given that the effect of condition is central to our research
question, we examine the main effect of condition before
outlining more complex, higher-order interactions between
the independent variables. Figure 2 shows the average share
scores across photos for each condition. Post-hoc tests (a
Bonferroni correction was used to adjust p-values for multiple
comparisons here and in all subsequent comparisons) revealed
that participants in the Privacy-Perspective (PP) condition
demonstrated a greater likelihood to share photos than those
in the Baseline condition (MP P = −.42, SDP P = 1.32;
MBaseline = −.88, SDBaseline = 1.49, p = 0.03), but there
was no signiﬁcant difference between the Perspective-Taking
(PT) and Baseline groups, p = 0.34, or between the PP and
PT conditions, p = 0.48.
These results were contrary to our hypothesis in that we
expected privacy reminders would decrease the likelihood to
share photos. To better understand the effects of the two
experimental interventions on sharing decisions, we next ex-
amine whether the likelihood to share was modulated by the
previously rated valence of the photos as well as participants’
photo-sharing history.
1) Effects of photo valence: Figure 3 illustrates a signiﬁcant
interaction effect on sharing likelihood between the experi-
mental condition and photo valence (F (4.02, 721.66) = 8.38,
p  0.05.
In sum, high self-reported photo sharers were more likely
to share photos during the experiment, including those that
risk violating the privacy of others. These ﬁndings indicate
that high-frequency photo sharers are especially appropriate
targets of privacy-related interventions.
B. Gender and Photo Sharing
Though the main effect of gender was non-signiﬁcant,
there was a signiﬁcant interaction between photo valence and
Fig. 3. Mean photo-sharing likelihood by condition and photo valence, or
the degree to which photo subjects were portrayed negatively or positively.
Simple-effects analyses were used to understand how the
experimental manipulation was associated with photo-sharing
likelihood for photos of different valences, and detailed results
are presented in Appendix A (also see Figure 3). There
was a non-signiﬁcant effect of condition on likelihood to
share very negative photos. However, there was a condition
effect on photo-sharing likelihood for negative, positive, and
very positive photos. Bonferroni post-hoc tests revealed that
participants in the baseline condition were signiﬁcantly less
likely to share negative and positive photos than participants
in the PP condition (Fig 3; see Appendix A for means
and standard deviations). Baseline condition participants were
also signiﬁcantly less likely to share very positive photos, as
compared to PT and PP conditions. All other comparisons
were non-signiﬁcant.
In short, participants in the PP condition were more likely
to share negative, positive, and very positive photos than

2 = 0.05) as
illustrated in Figure 5. Simple-effects analyses with Bonferroni
adjustment showed that female participants were signiﬁcantly
less likely to share negative photos than male participants. In
contrast, female and male participants were not signiﬁcantly
different in their likelihood to share very negative, positive
and very positive photos. All other interactions and pairwise
comparisons were non-signiﬁcant. Overall, these results sug-
gest that female participants were less likely to share photos
that portray others in a negative light, and thus less likely to
violate other people’s privacy.
C. Online Activity, Privacy Preferences, and Photo Sharing
Likelihood
A hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to
examine the extent to which individual differences, including
social media usage and privacy measures, predicted photo-
sharing likelihood across conditions. For each participant,
sharing likelihood was calculated as the mean likelihood of
sharing the photos displayed during the experiment (min =
−3.00, max = 2.57, M = −.64, SD = 1.40).
The hierarchical multiple regression analysis included three
types of predictors. First, factors related to social media usage,
including self-reported number of social media accounts (i.e.,
total number of social media platforms used from a list of
ﬁve options), frequency of visits to social media websites
(0 = Never, 7 = Multiple times a day), and frequency of
real-world photo-sharing online (0 = Never, 7 = Multiple
times a day) were entered into the model. Second, measures
of privacy,
including the privacy preference question and
familiar posting subscale total score from the social media
privacy questionnaire were included in the model. The privacy
preference question asked participants to rate the extent to
which they considered themselves a private person who keeps
to themselves, versus an open person who enjoys sharing with
others (1 = very private, 7 = very open). The familiar posting
subscale assessed the extent to which participants had posted
embarrassing photos of people they know and regretted posting
photos of people they know online. The familiar posting
subscale was selected due to its high correlation with average
likelihood to share (r(379) = 0.53, p < 0.001), while other
subscales were excluded due to their correlation with one
another (r(379) = 0.43 − 0.71, p < 0.001). Finally, condition
was entered into the model to examine its effect in relation to
individual differences.
As shown in Table II,2 the results of this analysis in-
dicated that social media usage accounted for a signiﬁcant
amount of the photo-sharing likelihood variability (R2 change
= .21, F (3, 375) = 33.51, p < 0.001). The privacy measures
predicted sharing likelihood signiﬁcantly over-and-above mea-
sures of social media usage (R2 change = .10, F (2, 373) =
27.52, p < 0.001). In addition, condition contributed signif-
icantly to the predictive validity of the model (R2 change
= .02, F (1, 372) = 10.28, p = 0.001). Despite correla-
tions between predictors, tolerance values for all independent
variables were greater than .20 and variance inﬂation factors
less than four, indicating that the model was not signiﬁcantly
compromised by multicollinearity.
Table II outlines the extent to which social media usage,
measures of privacy, and condition relate to photo-sharing
likelihood. Of the measures entered into the full model,
all variables except number of social media accounts were
signiﬁcantly correlated with average likelihood of sharing.
Frequency of photo sharing on real social media platforms and
personal privacy rating were most strongly related to sharing
likelihood. Supporting this conclusion is the strength of the
bivariate correlation between self-reported frequency of photo
sharing on real social media platforms and sharing likelihood
across conditions, (r(379) = 0.43, p < 0.001), as well as the
correlation partialling out the effects of all other predictors in
the full model (r(372) = 0.29, p < 0.001). In addition, there
was a signiﬁcant correlation between personal privacy rating
and sharing likelihood across conditions (r(379) = 0.47,
