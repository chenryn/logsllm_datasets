**Title: Issues and Etiquette Concerning the Use of Shared Measurement Data**

**Authors: Mark Allman and Vern Paxson**

**Abstract:**
In this note, we address the challenges and considerations surrounding the provision and use of shared network measurement data among researchers. While previous work has focused on the technical aspects of enabling data sharing through traffic anonymization, our focus is on higher-level issues such as potential harm to data providers (e.g., de-anonymization of datasets) and the benefits of collaboration in subsequent research (e.g., establishing ground truth). We believe that a community dialogue on the expectations and responsibilities of data providers, and the etiquette involved in using others' measurement data, would be beneficial. To this end, we provide a set of guidelines to facilitate the process of sharing measurement data. These guidelines are not intended as rigid rules but rather as a framework to foster mutual understanding between providers and users.

**1. Introduction**
Collecting a substantial set of network measurements typically requires both favorable circumstances and significant effort. Favorable circumstances include administrative and legal permissions, operational support, and access to necessary resources. The hard work involves developing and debugging software, calibrating equipment, monitoring the collection process, organizing the data, capturing appropriate metadata, and addressing any issues that arise.

Given these challenges, it is highly beneficial for researchers to share measurement datasets rather than independently acquiring them. This is especially true for Internet measurement studies, where sharing datasets can provide broader and more representative insights into the diverse nature of Internet traffic and dynamics.

Researchers have long advocated for data sharing (e.g., [4, 16, 9]). Early efforts, such as the Internet Traffic Archive [15], aimed to provide a platform for researchers to share their data. However, maintaining such platforms proved more time-consuming than anticipated. More recent initiatives, like DatCat [17] and PREDICT [3], have established databases for released (mostly passive) datasets. Additionally, individual groups and conferences (such as PAM and IMC) have encouraged data sharing through awards and other incentives. Non-public data sharing also occurs within and between institutions.

We strongly encourage the widespread sharing of measurement data. However, we have observed a range of attitudes and assumptions in the community regarding the provision and use of shared data. In this note, we aim to outline reasonable, high-level considerations for sharing and using measurement data. We do not provide a comprehensive set of "ground rules" because each data-sharing situation has unique considerations and threat models. Instead, we offer a framework to help providers and users better understand how to treat particular datasets.

**2. Data Release Considerations**
Releasing data is fraught with potential problems, including privacy concerns, embarrassment, and security risks. However, there are also significant benefits, such as advancing network research and gaining positive recognition within the community.

The primary goal of data release is to minimize potential problems while maximizing the research value of the data. Researchers have developed various anonymization techniques to scrub data before release [10, 18, 5, 14, 13]. However, these techniques do not provide guaranteed protection against information leakage. Therefore, the decision about what to release, how to obscure the data, and to whom to release it, are policy decisions. Different policies may apply to different situations. For example, a university's network operators might consider professors, students, and the public as three different threat models, requiring three different anonymization approaches.

**Guidelines for Data Release:**

1. **Understand the Threat Model:** Providers should carefully understand the threat model for each situation and use this understanding to frame the anonymization policy applied to the data. It is important to recognize that even with careful anonymization, some information may still be leaked as inference techniques evolve.

2. **Explicit Acceptable Use Policy:** Providers should enumerate an explicit Acceptable Use policy for the data. This policy should clearly state the bounds of what sort of analysis is allowed or disallowed. Violations of these terms can result in the user receiving no more data from the provider and potentially facing censure when attempting to publish their work.

3. **Interactions with Users:** Providers should be explicit about the interactions they are willing to have with users. Analyzing measurement data often leads to questions about the environment, collection strategy, and filtering artifacts. Providers should clarify the types of assistance they can and will provide.

4. **Retention of Raw Data and Metadata:** Providers should specify what raw data and metadata they intend to retain and for how long. This information can be useful for users who need to understand the context of the shared data.

5. **Notification and Acknowledgment:** Providers should state their desired notification and acknowledgment requirements for the use of the data in publications.

**3. Data Use Considerations**
While care is necessary when releasing data, it is equally important when using others' data for scholarly purposes. Users should understand the difficulties and costs involved in releasing data. For example, the effort to design and implement suitable anonymization policies and obtain approval to release packet traces at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory took months [2].

**Guidelines for Data Use:**

1. **Respect the Provider's Effort:** Users should do nothing to hinder the ability of the provider to release more data in the future or to have a broader chilling effect on the community's ability to release data. Users should scrupulously follow the Acceptable Use policies that accompany the data.

2. **Reporting Findings:** Reporting findings obtained from using others' data can sometimes be tricky. Researchers should aggregate information to reduce sensitivity and further anonymize the data they report. For example, instead of providing fine-grained details, researchers can characterize the general nature of the data.

3. **Purpose-Provided Data:** Informal data sharing, such as during collaborations or for specific projects, often involves less stringent anonymization. In such cases, researchers must not further re-distribute non-public data, exercise great care in storing the data, and explicitly inform providers about who will have access to the data. Researchers should employ the data only for the specified project.

**4. Interactions Between Providers and Users**
Effective communication and interaction between data providers and users are crucial. Providers should be clear about their expectations and the boundaries of acceptable use. Users, in turn, should respect these boundaries and engage in responsible and ethical use of the data.

**5. Final Thoughts**
The sharing of network measurement data is a valuable practice that can significantly advance research and understanding. By adhering to the guidelines outlined in this note, both providers and users can contribute to a more collaborative and responsible research community.
