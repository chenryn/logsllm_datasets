User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Find a stolen iphone that isn't activated I called Apple to see if they could ping my stolen iPhone 4. They said that they cant because the "find my iphone" isnt on. The phone isnt activated but the person who stole it has been using it to get into my emails, Facebook and other apps linked to my Apple ID, because as most know as long as there is wifi iPhones can used to do everytjing except make calls and text. 
Is there a way to find the location of the phone using the IMEI and the last time it was on wifi?

Assistant: Your carrier has a history of the approximate location of the phone based on the cell towers it connects to.

Get in touch with the police and they will in turn contact the carrier to get the info from them.

If the person connected the iPhone to their own Wi-Fi you can also ask the police to obtain the connection logs from your online services still configured on that phone (e-mail, Facebook, etc). With the IP address of the Wi-Fi connection it'll be very easy for them to track down the owner of that particular Internet connection.
