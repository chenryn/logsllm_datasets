Consider the case of someone who wishes to test out a package built in a
WIndows configuration on a Linux machine (using WINE.) To do so one should be
able to pass in `--cfg 'target_os = "win32"'` and have it override the
existing target_os. Suprisingly, instead both configurations are activated.
That's okay but what is really bad is that one can't even pass in `--cfg
'not(target_os = "win32")'` and disable the old configuration.
