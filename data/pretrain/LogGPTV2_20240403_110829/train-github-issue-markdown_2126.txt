## Question
When performing a batch insert of 10,000 records, the default method takes only 2-3 seconds. However, using Sharding-JDBC for the same operation takes more than 2 minutes. How can we optimize this process to improve efficiency?

### Database
- MySQL 5.7

### Steps to Optimize

1. **Batch Size Tuning**:
   - Adjust the batch size in Sharding-JDBC. Smaller batch sizes may reduce memory usage but increase the number of round-trips to the database. Conversely, larger batch sizes can reduce the number of round-trips but may increase memory usage. Experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal balance.

2. **Connection Pool Configuration**:
   - Ensure that the connection pool (e.g., HikariCP, C3P0) is properly configured. Increase the maximum pool size and other relevant parameters to handle the increased load during batch inserts.

3. **Sharding Strategy**:
   - Review and optimize the sharding strategy. Ensure that the sharding key is well-distributed and that the data is evenly distributed across the shards. This can help avoid hotspots and improve overall performance.

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Tune the MySQL configuration parameters such as `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, `innodb_log_file_size`, and `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` to optimize write performance.
   - Consider using bulk insert methods like `LOAD DATA INFILE` if applicable, which can be significantly faster for large datasets.

5. **Profiling and Monitoring**:
   - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in the Sharding-JDBC and database layers. Tools like JProfiler, VisualVM, or MySQL's built-in slow query log can help pinpoint areas for improvement.

6. **Parallel Processing**:
   - If possible, implement parallel processing to distribute the load. Sharding-JDBC supports parallel execution, so ensure that it is configured to take advantage of this feature.

By following these steps, you should be able to optimize the batch insert process and improve the overall efficiency of your application.
