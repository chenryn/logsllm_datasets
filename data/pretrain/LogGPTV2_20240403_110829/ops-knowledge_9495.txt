Assistant: The steps to build a WordPress blog on a cloud server are as follows: 1. Choose a cloud service provider, such as Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, etc., and create a virtual machine instance on the platform. 2. Install the LAMP or LNMP environment, where LAMP is Linux + Apache + MySQL + PHP, and LNMP is Linux + Nginx + MySQL + PHP. These environments are required to run WordPress. 3. Download WordPress, and unzip it in the /var/www/html/ directory, or upload it to the server. 4. Create a MySQL database for WordPress and save the username and password. 5. Enter the WordPress directory, copy wp-config-sample.php as wp-config.php, edit the wp-config.php file, and fill in the database user name, password and database name into the corresponding fields. 6. Enter the cloud server IP address (or domain name) in the browser to start the WordPress installation wizard. Follow the navigation to create an administrator account and site settings. 7. Install the necessary plugins and themes, and configure them as desired. 8. Deploy an HTTPS certificate (such as using Let's Encrypt free certificate) to ensure the security and credibility of the blog. 9. Visit your WordPress site and check that everything is working properly.
