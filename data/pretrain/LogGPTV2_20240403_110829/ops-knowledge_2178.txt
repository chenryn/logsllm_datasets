User: What I want to know are actually 2 things.
Part 1:
I have a developed source code for an application in python that uses Django framework. 
What I want is to be able to run the code on a developer machine and see the result. What do I need for it?
(my guesses):
Python development enironment (Eclipse/PyDev/Aptana Studio 3 seem to be the better ones for windows not sure linux yet),
I also have a postgre database already setup (I know there's a file where I have to specify connection information)
- something installed from django or would this be already included in the code that I have?
Part II:
I also want to make a dev server accessible through internet.
 - this is the major part of the question and the most important. How do I publish the app?
 - I have a linux machine that I would do this on, but unsure of all the things I need.   Apache server?
Assistant: You need Python, Django, a WSGI container (e.g. mod_wsgi, uWSGI, Paste Deploy), and a database server. You make the Django project available as a WSGI app, bound to the appropriate interface on the machine.
