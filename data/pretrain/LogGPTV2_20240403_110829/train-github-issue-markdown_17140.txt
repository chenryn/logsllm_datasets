The idea is to have a Gantt graph for the DAGs in the UI, so that you can see
at what hours there are more overlaps, when you have a gap without any dag
running, which ones are the most time consuming etc.
I think it could be done by taking the average execution time of the dag in
the last X days from the metadata database or something like that. Also, for
further precision, an outlier processing could be done as well.
From my point of view, is a very nice feature to be added to the new UI
