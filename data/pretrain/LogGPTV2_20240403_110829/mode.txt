### Mode Command Overview

The `mode` command is used to display system status, change system settings, or reconfigure ports and devices. If no parameters are provided, `mode` displays all controllable attributes of the console and available COM devices.

#### Serial Port Configuration

**Purpose:**
Configures a serial communications port and sets the output handshake.

**Syntax:**
```sh
mode com[:] [baud=] [parity=] [data=] [stop=] [to={on|off}] [xon={on|off}] [odsr={on|off}] [octs={on|off}] [dtr={on|off|hs}] [rts={on|off|hs|tg}] [idsr={on|off}]
```

**Parameters:**

- **com[:]:** Specifies the number of the asynchronous communications port (e.g., COM1).
- **baud=:** Specifies the transmission rate in bits per second. Valid values include:
  - 110, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200.
- **parity=:** Specifies how the system uses the parity bit to check for transmission errors. Valid values include:
  - n (none), e (even, default), o (odd), m (mark), s (space). Not all devices support mark and space.
- **data=:** Specifies the number of data bits in a character. Valid values range from 5 through 8. The default value is 7. Not all devices support 5 and 6.
- **stop=:** Specifies the number of stop bits that define the end of a character. Valid values are 1, 1.5, or 2. The default value is 2 for 110 baud, otherwise 1. Not all devices support 1.5.
- **to={on|off}:** Specifies whether the device uses infinite timeout processing. The default value is off. Turning this option on means the device will never stop waiting for a response.
- **xon={on|off}:** Specifies whether the system allows the XON/XOFF protocol for flow control. This enhances reliability but may reduce performance.
- **odsr={on|off}:** Specifies whether the system turns on the Data Set Ready (DSR) output handshake.
- **octs={on|off}:** Specifies whether the system turns on the Clear to Send (CTS) output handshake.
- **dtr={on|off|hs}:** Specifies whether the system turns on the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) output handshake. Setting this to `on` provides a constant signal, while `hs` provides a handshake signal.
- **rts={on|off|hs|tg}:** Specifies whether the system turns on the Request to Send (RTS) output handshake. `on` provides a constant signal, `hs` provides a handshake signal, and `tg` toggles between ready and not ready states.
- **idsr={on|off}:** Specifies whether the system turns on DSR sensitivity. This must be on to use DSR handshaking.
- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.

#### Device Status

**Purpose:**
Displays the status of a specified device. If no parameters are provided, `mode` displays the status of all installed devices.

**Syntax:**
```sh
mode [] [/status]
```

**Parameters:**

- **:** Specifies the name of the device (e.g., LPT1: through LPT3:, COM1: through COM9:, CON).
- **/status:** Requests the status of any redirected parallel printers. You can also use `/sta` as an abbreviated version.
- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.

#### Redirect Printing

**Purpose:**
Redirects printer output. You must be a member of the Administrators group to redirect printing.

**Note:**
To send parallel printer output to a serial printer, use the `mode` command twice: first to configure the serial port, then to redirect parallel printer output to the specified serial port.

**Syntax:**
```sh
mode LPT[:]=COM[:]
```

**Parameters:**

- **LPT[:]:** Specifies the number of the LPT to configure (e.g., LPT1: through LPT3:).
- **COM[:]:** Specifies the COM port to configure (e.g., COM1: through COM9:).
- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.

**Examples:**

- To redirect a serial printer operating at 4800 baud with even parity connected to COM1:
  ```sh
  mode com1 48,e,,,b
  mode lpt1=com1
  ```
- To prevent redirection from LPT1 to COM1:
  ```sh
  mode lpt1
  ```

#### Select Code Page

**Purpose:**
Configures or queries the code page information for a selected device.

**Syntax:**
```sh
mode  codepage select=
mode  codepage [/status]
```

**Parameters:**

- **:** Specifies the device (CON is the only valid name).
- **codepage:** Specifies which code page to use with the device. You can also use `cp` as an abbreviation.
- **select=:** Specifies the number of the code page to use. Supported code pages include:
  - 437: United States
  - 850: Multilingual (Latin I)
  - 852: Slavic (Latin II)
  - 855: Cyrillic (Russian)
  - 857: Turkish
  - 860: Portuguese
  - 861: Icelandic
  - 863: Canadian-French
  - 865: Nordic
  - 866: Russian
  - 869: Modern Greek
- **/status:** Displays the current code pages selected for the device. You can also use `/sta`.
- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.

#### Display Mode

**Purpose:**
Changes the size of the command prompt screen buffer.

**Syntax:**
```sh
mode con[:] [cols=] [lines=]
```

**Parameters:**

- **con[:]:** Indicates that the change applies to the Command Prompt window.
- **cols=:** Specifies the number of columns in the command prompt screen buffer. The default is 80, but you can set it to any value. Typical non-default values are 40 and 135.
- **lines=:** Specifies the number of lines in the command prompt screen buffer. The default is 25, but you can set it to any value. A typical non-default value is 50.
- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.

#### Typematic Rate

**Purpose:**
Sets the keyboard typematic rate, which is the speed at which Windows repeats a character when you hold down a key.

**Note:**
Some keyboards do not recognize this command.

**Syntax:**
```sh
mode con[:] [rate= delay=]
```

**Parameters:**

- **con[:]:** Specifies the keyboard.
- **rate=:** Specifies the rate at which a character is repeated. The default is 20 characters per second for IBM AT-compatible keyboards and 21 for IBM PS/2-compatible keyboards. You can use any value from 1 to 32.
- **delay=:** Specifies the time before the character output repeats. The default is 2 (.50 seconds), but you can use 1 (.25 seconds), 3 (.75 seconds), or 4 (1 second).
- **/?:** Displays help at the command prompt.
