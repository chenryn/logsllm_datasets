User: I install a program through python, git in this case.  Immediately after, I will call os.system("git --version") but the call doesn't go through because of the snapshot of variables has not been updated.
Is there a way to refresh the cmd prompt?  Maybe just reimport os or something?
The issue i am having is that after installing an application, the app related cmd commands are not yet key words.
I have noticed this is a reoccurring issue in all of my platform configuration installs.
I spent awhile reading docs but i havent see anything really jumping out at me other than the concept that the env is pulls at the time of importing os so maybe that means i could dump and reimport it.
Assistant: since i know where it will be installed, you can set env, and then call sub processes.
The issue i was having is that a lot of these executables assign their own path variables which is what i wanted to do.  Since i cant relaunch a new console due to security issues, the best course of action would be to navigate to the new applications target bin folder or otherwise and then set the env or pass it into subprocesses by appending it with Env variables.
