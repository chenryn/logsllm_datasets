Question: Consider you are tasked with designing a secure communication protocol based on the discrete logarithm problem. Select the statements that accurately reflect the properties and challenges of implementing such a protocol:
"A": "The discrete logarithm problem is considered computationally easy, making it a poor choice for secure protocols.",
"B": "A one-way function like that used in the discrete logarithm problem is analogous to mixing colors, which suggests that reversing the process is practically impossible.",
"C": "Efficient algorithms are known to solve for 'x' in the equation \(f(x) = g^x \pmod{p}\), which compromises the security of the discrete logarithm problem.",
"D": "The hardness of the discrete logarithm problem underpins the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol."
