Hello,
currently, I'm trying to integrate a custom third-party input field (source
code editor) written in JavaScript which is not based on Angular. Thus I need
to wrap it to a component, use `EventEmitter` to report changes outside and
use `ngOnChanges` to apply changes coming from outside.
The `Input` of the component is named `model` and the `Output` is named
`modelChange` so that the other components _can_ take advantage of a two-way
data binding.
I've noticed that if the parent component applies the two-way data binding and
if the child emits an event, the change of the parent's data emits another
event which is sent back to the child. If you imagine that the `ngOnChanges`
calls an expensive method that handles the change, you probably agree with me
that this effect is something I would like to avoid. Can you please provide a
mechanism to achieve this?
Or am I doing something wrong? Can it be done better?
Here is a Plunk demonstrating the echo effect:
