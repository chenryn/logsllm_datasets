User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Dell PowerEdge SC1425 - Fan control Yesterday I received a second-hand Dell PowerEdge SC1425 1U server.

The cooling fans are extremely loud and I would like to know if there is a way to slow them down -- I searched Google but wasn't able to find any information on controlling the fan speed, and there doesn't appear to be a fan speed option in the BIOS.
My server also does not have the Utility Partition (F10 boot option).

Before booting while the system is showing the Dell logo the fans are slowed down, but once the system boots they seem to go to maximum speed.

I don't know if this is important or not, but the system has  2x2.8GHz Xeon processors, 8GB Ram, 320GB HDD.
The BIOS revision is A03, and the image below shows the fan speeds reported by the IPMI sensors.

Assistant: The fan speed change during startup is normal -- All modern servers start with their fans at or near minimum speed, run them up to full speed to verify that the fans (and their speed sensors) are functioning, then set them appropriately according to the measured system temperature.

The fan speed in a PowerEdge SC1425 is entirely controlled by temperature sensors (unlike the other servers I believe the "PowerEdge SC" series has no BIOS option to set/override the base speed: You're stuck with "automatic").

Note that if a sensor fails (or the system THINKS it has failed) the fans will run at full speed (this is a safety feature to prevent your server from overheating). All you can do is check the system event log to make sure there are no temperature sensor failures reported.

Also note that the fan speed profiles are determined by the version of the BIOS you have installed, so make sure you have the most current BIOS for your system (check the Dell website).

If the sensors are all functioning and you have the most recent BIOS your system is Working As Designed.



As Michael Hampton pointed out, 1U server fans are VERY LOUD (all of them - not just Dell) - they have to move a huge volume of air as the CPU heat sinks are typically behind the hard drives, which themselves generate a considerable amount of heat.  

Since you're not supposed to be in the same room as the machine while it's running making them quiet is not a major design goal.
