RIPE Atlas (Atlas) had more VPs (10,196 vs 178) than CAIDA’s Ark project,
but far fewer usable  pairs (823 vs. 6,778). Although both platforms probe
the full set of routed preﬁxes, Atlas divides its preﬁx list across 10,196 VPs [52],
while Ark divides /24 preﬁxes across its 178 VPs. Thus, an Ark probe has a
larger probability of probing the same preﬁx. The set of common pairs did not
change despite our attempts to augment our dataset with targeted traceroutes
between and toward Atlas VPs in Angola and Brazil post-SACS.
3.4 Adding Supplementary Datasets
We annotated each IP address with its operating AS, router hostname, and geo-
graphic information. Using bdrmapIT [42], we mapped 95% of our IPs into ASes.
We used zdns [28] and qr [37] to resolve 35% of those IPs to hostnames. We geolo-
cated IP addresses using the methodology described in Sect. 2. We mapped IP
hops to their corresponding AS’s country if either: (i) the AS had no customers
and NetAcuity [25] geolocated more than 50% of its IP addresses (i.e., those it
originates into BGP) to the country, or (ii) 50% of its AS customers geolocated
to the same country (by the same process as in (i)). We marked all IP addresses
whose hostnames contained geographic hints and updated the city and country
they refer to. For cases where we found suboptimal routing (Sect. 4.2), we man-
ually cross-checked the geographic hints and the RTT diﬀerence to validate the
inferred locations. We then identiﬁed IXPs at which AC peered pre and post-
event, using IXP preﬁxes in CAIDA’s IXPs dataset [14] as described in Sect. 2.
The cable deployment, although entirely within AC’s network, could have
triggered a substantial change in the number of BGP paths traversing this AS,
since other ASes would have incentive to leverage it, especially those who route

traﬃc between the connected countries/continents. To explore this hypothesis,
we analyzed BGP-observed AS paths traversing AC pre and post-SACS. For
computation and evaluation of the AS path length, we gathered AS paths (with-
out loops or private ASes) collected from Routeviews [44] and RIS [53] during
the ﬁrst ﬁve days of Aug and Oct 2018 and included AC (AS37468). To check the
post-SACS path stability, we collected new IP paths using Ark and LG servers
in AC transit providers and customers between mid-May and end-June 2019.
4 Results and Validation
4.1 Eﬀects on Performance
We quantiﬁed the observed RTT changes for packets sent from ASes hosting Ark
and Atlas VPs that crossed the cable. We discovered cases of both performance
improvements and degradations on paths used pre vs. post-SACS (Figs. 2 and 3).
Our results conﬁrm Prior’s claim [50] that the new cable “reduced latency to
the Americas substantially, including a reduction from 338 ms to 163 ms between
Cape Town and Miami”. VPs in South America also experienced lower latencies

closest to the destination IPs. Sets BEFORE or AFTER are deﬁned in Sect. 2. We
present ΔRT TAF T ER−BEF ORE per sub-ﬁgure. RTT changes are similar across plat-
forms. Paths from South America experienced a median RTT decrease of 38%, those
from Oceania-Australia, a smaller decrease of 8%, while those from Africa and North-
America, roughly 3%. Conversely, paths from Europe and Asia that crossed SACS after
its deployment experienced an average RTT increase of 40% and 9%, respectively.

to Africa, with a median RTT decrease of 38% toward all measured African
countries. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the drop of latencies from Europe/Africa toward
Brazil and those from Brazil to Angola as claimed in [27,36], except for VPs in
North America and Asia, which experienced higher latencies to Brazil (Fig. 3).
However, our data does not conﬁrm the claim that latencies to Angola generally
experienced an improvement [27,36,57] – on the contrary, paths from VPs in
Africa, Asia, and Europe had median latency increases!
Figure 2 shows a boxplot of minimum RTT values observed between
Ark/Atlas source IP/destination preﬁx () pairs. After fetching match-
ing traceroutes (Sect. 3.3), half of the 6,778 Ark  pairs were sourced from
North America, while most (65.2%) of the 823 Atlas ones were sourced from
Africa. For both measurements platforms, at least 16% of the  pairs were
sourced from Europe. Figure 3 presents a heatmap of RTT diﬀerences pre vs.
post-SACS, for continent/destination country pairs. For statistical signiﬁcance,
we considered only such pairs for which we had at least 20 IP paths. Each box
contains the number of observed  pairs (Sect. 2.1). The x-axis shows the
VP locations, while the y-axis the destination preﬁx countries. The countries on
the y-axis are all direct customers of AC. None of Angola’s direct geographic
neighbors (Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Namibia, or Democratic Republic of
Congo) are represented on the y-axis. Neither are those neighbors in the 1,034
ASes of AC’s AS customer cone [12,54].

average change per region and the y-axis by ΔRT T

observed  pairs, and is colored according to
the corresponding ΔRT T ; a grey cell means data
non-available. The highest performance improve-
ments are observed from South America to Angola
or South Africa, while the worst degradations are
from Africa to Angola or North-America to Brazil.
