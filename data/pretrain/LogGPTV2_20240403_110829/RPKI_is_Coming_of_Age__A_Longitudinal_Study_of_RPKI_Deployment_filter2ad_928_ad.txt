• DDoS Protection: Origin ASes may outsource “scrubbing” of
their traffic by using traffic diversion to a DDoS protection service
(DPS) [30]. These services usually announce IP prefixes on behalf
of owners, which may cause their BGP announcements to be
invalid if the prefix owner has not updated the ROAs. For this
analysis, we obtain a list of DDoS protection ASes from a recent
report by Forrester [56], and look for invalid announcements
where their announcing AS is a known DDoS protection AS.
• Other: If none of the prior cases hold, we do not know the exact
cause of the invalid announcement. This case would include
attempted (sub-)prefix hijacking, as such announcements would
not likely fall under the three categories above. We therefore
label these as “other”.13
Based on this classification, we plot the number of the announce-
ments falling into each of the categories in Figure 8. We immediately
observe non-trivial fractions of the same ISP, provider–customer,
and other invalid announcements; only rarely do we observe in-
valid announcements due to DDoS protection services. We make a
number of observations below.
First, we can confirm multiple cases where an ISP swaps and
announces their IP prefixes between two ASes that it manages; for
example, Telmex Colombia S.A that manages two ASes, AS 10620
and AS 14080, announced 1,518 IP prefixes (RouteViews dataset)
and 1,118 (RIPE-RIS dataset) from AS 10620 between June 8, 2011
and March 2, 2012; however, these IP prefixes were supposed to
be announced from AS 14080 as the ASN of their matched VRPs
13We acknowledge that the cases we listed above are not exhaus-
tive; however, even this limited list allows us to understand general
behavior of the BGP announcements that do not fall into these
categories.

ASNs in four categories. Note that y axis on the RouteViews
dataset extends to 16,498!
was actually AS 14080, thus causing all of them to be considered
invalid.
Unfortunately, it took almost 9 months for the problem to be
corrected. They first deleted all ROAs on March 2, 2012, changing
the status of all of the announcements to unknown.14 After that,
they reverted to the same ROAs on March 6, 2012 and stopped
announcing the prefixes from the invalid origin.
We also observe a similar misconfiguration in the Akamai dataset
where Altice Dominicana—which manages both AS 12066 and
AS 28118—announced 545 IP prefixes from AS 28118, which were
supposed to be announced from AS 12066. Similar to the misconfig-
uration of Telmex Colombia S.A., these invalid BGP announcements
lasted for more than 17 months from July 26, 2017 until the latest
snapshot of the Akamai dataset.
Second, surprisingly, we rarely see announcements from DDoS
protection ASes. We found only 15 IP prefixes (in the RouteViews
dataset) in our latest snapshots: AS 26415 (Verisign Global) announc-
ing 6 IP prefixes owned by AS 13285 (TalkTalk Communications),
AS 19905 (Neustar) announcing an IP prefix owned by AS 21599
(Cable Onda) and 3 ASes from Level3 announcing 8 IP prefixes
owned by 3 different ISPs.
Third, we observe that mismatches between ASNs who are in a
provider–customer relationship happen frequently. For example,
AS 6128 (Cablevision Systems Corp.) who sub-allocated its IP pre-
fixes to 9 different ASes has ROAs that cover all of the sub-prefixes
14This means validating routers will accept the announcements,
but all the security benefits of RPKI have been effectively stripped.

• We also find a hijack attempt concentrated in a certain country:
AS 55649 (a private ISP in Hong Kong) announced 1,091 IP pre-
fixes originally owned by 12 ASes on February 28, 2018, 10 of
which are located in China.15
• We also observe cases where one AS issued large numbers of
BGP announcements with prefixes owned by multiple ASes; for
example, AS 37468 (Angola Cables) announced more than 3,500
IP prefixes originally owned by 82 ASes on May 11, 2018. They
did so again on July 19, 2018 by announcing more than 15,000 IP
prefixes owned by 1,554 ASes.16
• Interestingly, we also often observe a case where one AS becomes
a target from many ASes; we observe, e.g., , 401 IP prefixes owned
by AS 27738 (Ecuadortelecom S.A.) being announced by 743 ASes
on January 7, 2018, but we could not find corroborating evidence
for why this happened.
From these examples, we observe that ASes who misconfigured
their ROAs (e.g., an ISP swapping the IP prefixes between two ASes
it manages, a provider AS not updating the ROAs) have generally
announced unauthorized prefixes a bit longer. Based on this obser-
vation, we plot Figure 9, which shows the cumulative distribution
of the number of dates on which we observed a same pair of ori-
gin AS and IP prefix of invalid BGP announcements during our
measurement period in each of the categories. We make a num-
ber of observations; First, we observe that invalid announcements
in the “other” category are generally announced shorter than the
other categories across the datasets; for example, 34.6% (Akamai),
55% (RIPE-RIS), 86.9% (RouteViews) of “other” announcements are
observed only for a single day.
Second, we also find invalid BGP announcements from the ASes
in a customer-provider relationship last longer; for example, 10.3%
(Akamai), 9.8% (RIPE-RIS), 9.6% (RouteViews) of these are observed
more than 365 days.
We have shown that many unauthorized BGP announcements
are not necessarily suspicious attempts. Rather, they are likely
to be due to misconfigurations such as setting ROA IP prefixes

but set the ASN as their own ASN, thus making the IP prefixes
announced from all of their customer ASes invalid from October
27, 2013 to our latest snapshot.
We also observe that the case where a provider AS publishes
the ROAs but its customer announces the IP prefixes has happened
more frequently than the opposite case; during our measurement
period, we find that 87.95% (Akamai), 89.46% (RIPE-RIS), and 84.40%
(RouteViews) of those announcements are due to providers that
have not updated the ASN in their ROAs to be the customers’ ASN
(as opposed to a customer whose ROAs announce the provider’s
full prefix). We believe that the main cause of this would be the
cases where a provider announces covered-prefixes, but it (a) does
not have information on more specific announcements (and how
they change) made by their customers, and (b) it simply cannot
delegate ROA management for this space to their customers when
using RIR-hosted services.
Four, we observe a number of invalid announcements in the
“other” category with different behaviors; we present a few notable
examples where a single AS announced more than 1,000 prefixes
that are actually owned by other ASes or more than 1,000 prefixes
of an owner AS are announced by unauthorized ASes at a given
date across our datasets;
• From January 12, 2017 to March 9, 2017 (in the Akamai dataset),
AS 395561 (Absolute Connections) announced more than 28,322
IP prefixes owned by 694 other ASes, which suggests that it had
attempted to hijack many IP prefixes.

too wide making BGP announcements too-specific or announcing
prefixes from a different ASN managed by the same ISP. Our simple
classification methods allow us to (loosely) estimate what fraction
of invalid BGP announcements is possibly due to misconfigurations.
This leaves us with a rest category of “other” invalid announcements.
As Figure 10 shows, the number of “other” invalids is low, but not
negligible (1.39% for Akamai, 1.07% for RIPE-RIS, and 1.13% for
RouteViews at the end of our measurement period). In the next
section, we attempt to find explanations for this last category.
6 OTHER INVALID ANNOUNCEMENTS
We now turn our attention to examining the remaining invalid
announcements in the “other” category, for which we have not yet
found an explanation. As these announcements originate from an
origin which has likely nothing to do with the authorized origin,
we first compare them with well-known hijacking incidents. For
the remainder of this section, we will refer to the AS sending out
unauthorized and unknown announcements as the “attacking AS”
and the owner as the “victim AS” regardless of the actual intent
behind the announcements, which is consistent with prior BGP
work (such as [36]).17
6.1 Case study: BGPStream
BGPStream [9] monitors the real time BGP announcements from
multiple datasets such as RouteViews and RIPE-RIS. Among other
features, it attempts to detect hijacking attempts [40]. The project
also announces suspected hijacking incidents via their Twitter ac-
count [10]; for cross-validation purposes, we crawled all reports
from this account on suspected BGP hijacking attempts.
Out of 2,361 IPv4 hijack reports collected from the account,
2,082 IP prefixes are unknown to RPKI, but 279 were covered by at
least one of the VRPs we have. The 279 hijack reports contain (1)
the time when they detect the hijack, (2) IP prefix address, (3) prefix
length, (4) the authorized AS to announce the IP prefix, and (5) the
attacking AS. From this information, we are able to find each of the
ROAs and their VRPs in our dataset. We next validate and classify
them based on the same classification method we have introduced;
17We point out, again, that RPKI cannot be used to distinguish
those that prepend their ASN to the origin AS or impersonate the
origin AS because RPKI only attempts to verify the origin.
11
Figure 12: CDF of the # of attacking ASes that a victim AS
has been targeted by. Note that the x axis extends to 1,947
ASes (RouteViews)
• For 6 (2.15%) hijack reports, we observe that victim AS and at-
tacking AS were actually from the same ISP.
• For 10 (3.58%) hijack reports, we find that they are customer
and provider relationships and 9 of them are the case where a
provider AS registers ROAs, but the IP prefixes are announced
by its customer.
• We are not able to find any DDoS protection ASes that announce
prefixes on behalf of the origin.
• For 263 (94.27%) hijack reports (the remainder), we find that they
are in our “other” category.
These results show a potential impact of RPKI when it is deployed
correctly without misconfigurations; the few misconfigurations can
be easily patched by publishing correct ROAs. The remaining hijack
reports are at least suspicious and can be effectively filtered by
relying on RPKI validation.
6.2 Attacking vs. Victim AS
We now attempt to further understand unexplained invalid an-
nouncements by looking who pretended to be whom (attacker vs.
victim) in these announcements. First, we examine for how many
ASes an attacking AS has tried to steal prefixes. Figure 11 shows the
cumulative distribution of the # of victim ASes that an attacking AS
has tried to hijack. We observe that the majority of suspected attack-
ing ASes focus on a single victim. 75.4% (Akamai), 78.7% (RIPE-RIS)
and 71.8% (RouteViews) respectively are cases where a suspected
attacker targets just a single victim AS. However, we also observe
a few cases where some ASes attacked many victims; The 99th
percentile of the # of victim ASes are over 12 ASes (Akamai), 11
ASes (RIPE-RIS), and 19 ASes (RouteViews). In fact, AS 395561
(Absolute Connection) announced 11,512 prefixes owned by 701
ASes (in the Akamai dataset), AS 200759 (Innofield) announced 362
prefixes owned by 76 ASes (in the RIPE-RIS dataset), and AS 37468
(Angola Cable) announced 15,364 prefixes owned by 841 ASes.
Then, we shift focus to victim ASes to understand what are likely
popular targets because we observe invalid announcements from
many attacking ASes. Figure 12 shows the cumulative distribution
of the number of attacking ASes that have attempted to steal the
prefixes of a single AS.
We observe that the average # of attacks that a victim AS receives,
overall, is more than the average # of ASes targeted by attacking

are targeted by many different ASes preferentially. For example,
AS 60458 (Xtudio Networks S.L.U) was attacked from 138 ASes (from
the Akamai dataset) and AS 8048 (CANTV Servicios Venezuela) was
attacked from 173 (RIPE-RIS) and 1,947 ASes (RouteViews dataset)
during our measurement period. Considering that the prefixes of
the victim ASes are announced from more than 100 ASes that are
not in any provider-customer relationship, nor in the same ISP, nor
from the DDoS protection AS, we argue that these are highly likely
to be targeted attacks.
We find that we lack sufficient evidence to attribute intent to
all of the unexplained invalid announcements. Nevertheless, cir-
cumstantial evidence suggests that at least part of these invalid
announcements are likely hijack attempts. If routers apply RPKI
validation, then such suspicious announcements will be filtered out,
effectively protecting against hijacks. If, on the other hand, these
invalid announcements are due to some other, unknown configura-
tion error, then at least such errors are detected and can be resolved
in collaboration with the legitimate prefix holder.
6.3 Traffic from the “other” category
We now turn to examining the amount of traffic from the “other”
category, which might be helpful for network operators to estimate
the impact of dropping potentially suspicious prefixes using the
RPKI. In collaboration with Akamai Technologies, we calculated the
portion of all HTTP/HTTPs traffic that came from the IP prefixes
in “other” category between December 1st to December 28th, 2018.
Figure 13 shows these daily percentages of the HTTP/HTTPs traffic
from the “other” category. We find that a very small fraction of
traffic (less than 0.3%) was exchanged with the “other” prefixes,
indicating that Akamai would have lost at most 0.3% of traffic if they
had dropped only the invalid prefixes that are, in all likelihood, not
announced the authorized origin. However, we also note that this is
a non-negligible amount of traffic and that we cannot prove that the
invalid announcements are hijack attempts. As such, there remains
a need for reliable techniques for detecting hijacking attempts, so
that this information can be used in concert with RPKI validation
to safely drop unauthorized prefix announcements and their traffic.
7 DISCUSSION
7.1 MaxLength
It has been argued that the use of MaxLength is harmful [24, 26].
The reasoning is, that by allowing more specific announcements
the prefix holder makes itself vulnerable to malicious hijacks where
the origin ASN is spoofed by prepending it to the BGP path.
However, on the other hand, operators who announce prefixes
