User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How sensitive are mobile telephone numbers? A question that came to my mind. How sensitive are they really? I mean basically all you can do with them is 


stalking you with hiding caller ID 
find out which provider gave out the number but not 100%
because people can transfer numbers
try to find accounts associated with a number (Whatsapp, etc)


But eventually the possibilities seem to be not that spectacular. What could you add as a potential security (in this case rather privacy) flaw of revealing mobile numbers?

Assistant: Hacking : It was shown recently (source) that it is possible with enough information including the mobile number to convince a communications provider you've "lost" your SIM, issue a replacement in store (so you don't even need to receive their mail!) and then convince their bank to "trust" you via an SMS code they can text you and give you unauthorised access to their bank account. I suppose this would also work with any form of 2 factor authentication (like my domain registrar) or re-registering for What'sApp.
Information Disclosure : People typically link their mobile number to online services (Facebook, What'sApp, Hangouts, SnapChat). If all you have is a number, you can often reveal a lot of information about that person from that. I'm attempting to move flats at the moment and I add potential landlords' numbers to my phonebook then perform a contact sync in Facebook, What'sApp etc. to see if they are genuine before visiting them.  I often get pictures of people I've nothing other than a number for. Another answer refers to the Last Seen information which has stalking potential (what time are they waking up etc. likely at work and not checking their messages etc.).
Harassment: A study once showed the average person views a SMS text message within 5 seconds of the message being delivered. Unsolicited PPI calls in the UK have shown that people who have nothing other than your number can be quite disruptive. It's very annoying to have to change your number (notifying all the legitimate contacts of the number change), people will often not mute their phone even when receiving an excessive amount of unsolicited calls for fear they will miss an important legitimate one. I wouldn't underestimate the power of a device which most people keep less than a meter away from them for almost their entire day (even when in bed!). Nuisance phonecalls would certainly be disruptive for me!
Hacking : Some services have started using mobile numbers as an alternative method to login (at least Facebook but I'm sure there are others), often to log in as someone else an adversary requires a username and password.. if you already have the username, you're 50% of the way there.
Information Disclosure : In the US a phone number can often reveal the area it was registered in (List of North American Numbering Plan area codes). So you could move onto voting records etc. to try to find where that person lives. This was particularly notable with the SnapChat leak where due to the reputation the service has for sexting people performed analysis on the numbers to work out what areas people were located in.
Hacking : In the UK a number may (assuming they haven't switched providers) reveal their mobile provider which may further help an adversary commit some form of ID theft / phishing against the communications provider (a Vodafone prefixed telephone number might give away that the user is a Vodafone customer and from there someone could try and impersonate the owner of the number). Failing that if you get through to Voicemail often a network standard voicemail will be present (or some well known operator specific instructions after a custom outgoing message "You can press 1 at any time to re-record your message" can also reveal the provider).
Hacking : It was previously possible in the UK to ring up a communications provider's voicemail service, enter in the mobile number of someone and try the network's default PIN to remotely access their voicemail. This was used by a lot of UK media companies against some incredibly high profile people (source).
Hacking : Phone networks are often vulnerable to caller ID spoofing and if an adversary has your number they might be able to call people with your number and social engineer someone (your work's receptionist at the large organisation you work for?) into revealing further information about you. I doubt my payroll department would recognise my voice over anyone else's but I'm sure they'd believe that it has to be me because of my mobile number matching what the HR database says!


My personal take on my mobile number is I'll give it to anyone who has a legitimate reason to reach me, but I restrict it to those that are already friends on Facebook and certainly wouldn't place it anywhere particularly public.
