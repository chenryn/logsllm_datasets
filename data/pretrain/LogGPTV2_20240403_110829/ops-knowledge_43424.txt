User: How to debug a server that cannot connect to the network?
Assistant: There are several ways to debug a server that cannot connect to the network: 1. Confirm that the network configuration is correct: check whether the serverâ€™s IP address, subnet mask, gateway and other network configurations are correct. 2. Confirm that the network hardware is normal: check whether the network card is working normally and whether the cable is in good condition. 3. Check the firewall settings: the firewall may block the network connection, check whether the firewall settings are correct. 4. Check whether the DNS settings are correct: If you cannot access through the domain name, check whether the DNS server settings are correct. 5. Use the ping command to test whether the network is normal: Use the ping command to test whether the network is normal. If the ping fails, it means that the network connection is not normal. 6. Use the traceroute command to trace the routing situation: use the traceroute command to trace the routing situation of the data packet to determine the problem of the network connection and whether there is a network failure point. 7. Check whether the service is started: If the network service cannot be connected, check whether the service is started. 8. Log in to the server to view logs: log in to the server to view system logs and network logs, and check whether there is any error message. 9. Use network packet capture tools: use network packet capture tools, such as Wireshark, etc., to capture data packets during communication and analyze their contents to find out the cause of network connection problems. The above are some methods for debugging a server that cannot connect to the network, and you need to choose according to the specific situation.
