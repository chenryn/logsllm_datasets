Virtual Plots, Real Revolution (Temmingh and Geers - 2009)
“For example, in the week before an election, 
what if both left and right-wing blogs were 
seeded with false but credible information 
about one of the candidates? It could tip the 
balance in a close race to determine the 
winner”
Things get a bit more sinister in 2009. A 2009 
paper by Temmingh and Geers (Roelof 
Temmingh of Sensepost/Paterva/Maltego 
fame) states “For example, in the week before 
an election, what if both left and right-wing 
blogs were seeded with false but credible 
information about one of the candidates? It 
could tip the balance in a close race to 
determine the winner”.

Year Later…
…and in 2010 (if not earlier) we see it play out 
for real.  “Four days before the 2010 special 
election in Massachusetts to fill the Senate seat 
formerly held by Ted Kennedy, an anonymous 
source delivered a blast of political spam. The 
smear campaign launched against Democratic 
candidate Martha Coakley quickly infiltrated 
the rest of the election-related chatter on the 
social networking service Twitter. Detonating 
over just 138 minutes, the “Twitter bomb” and 
the rancorous claims it brought with it 
eventually reached tens of thousands of 
people.”….

Some notes  
“A single change in the decision to vote can 
affect many individuals….Because…. there are 
competing effects between the decay of 
influence and the growth in the number of 
acquaintances…….. But as people hang out with 
like-minded individuals… cascades will not be 
zero sum So the decision of a single individual 
to vote has a substantially larger impact than 
what an atomized theory of individuals might 
say….. “ 
Truthy: Mapping the Spread of Astroturf in 
Microblog Streams Detecting and Tracking 
Political Abuse in Social Media 
“…Here we focus on a particular social media 
platform, Twitter, and on one particular type of 
abuse, namely political astroturf — political 
campaigns disguised as spontaneous 
“grassroots” behavior that are in reality carried 
out by a single person or organization. This is 
related to spam but with a more specific 
domain context and potentially larger 
consequences.” 
Sep. 28, 2010 — Astroturfers, Twitter-bombers 
and smear campaigners need beware this 
election season as a group of leading Indiana 
University information and computer scientists 
have unleashed Truthy.indiana.edu, a 
sophisticated new Twitter-based research tool 
that combines data mining, social network 
analysis and crowdsourcing to uncover 
deceptive tactics and misinformation leading 
up to the Nov. 2 elections.

Year Later…
…The result of that election, Scott Brown won. 
Slide 41 
…this type of campaign has a name,  
Slide 42 
Swift-boating…
…Swiftboating – “The term swiftboating (also 
spelled swift-boating or swift boating) is an 
American neologism used pejoratively to 
describe an unfair or untrue political attack. 
The term is derived from the name of the 
organization "Swift Boat Veterans for Truth" 
(SBVT, later the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth) 
because of their widely publicized[1] then 
discredited campaign against 2004 US 
Presidential candidate John Kerry” (Wikipedia – 
26th March 2013)

and allegedly, prior to the 2012 Russian 
Presidential elections, a pro-Kremlin 
organization reportedly paid hundreds of 
thousands of $’s to network of internet users to 
help political cause by creating flattering 
coverage on Vladamir Putin.

Slide 44 
This is a little different to Swift-boating in that 
it’s generally not a smear 
campaign…Astroturfing - refers to political, 
advertising or public relations campaigns that 
are designed to mask the sponsors of the 
message to give the appearance of coming 
from a disinterested, grassroots participant. 
“It could tip the balance in a close race to 
determine the winner” (Temmingh & Geers, 
2009) 
Slide 45 
…This is essentially what gave rise to Truthy, a 
project started at Indiana University to “The 
Truthy system evaluates thousands of tweets 
an hour to identify new and emerging bursts of 
activity around memes of various flavors.”… 
“We also plan to use Truthy to detect political 
smears, astroturfing, misinformation, and other 
social pollution”

And in 2011,  it was revealed that the US were 
exploring fake persona’s. The anonymous 
attack on HBGary exposed emails discussing 
such use cases…

A SockPuppet is an online identity used for

Slide 47 
“A large virtual population, scattered all over 
the world and encompassing different 
socioeconomic backgrounds, could be 
programmed to support any personal, social, 
business, political, military, or terrorist 
agenda.” 
(Temmingh & Geers, 2009)
So it seemed that Temmingh and Geers’ future 
looking paper had it pretty much right - “In 
2009, hackers steal data, send spam, and deny 
service to other computers. In the future, they 
may also control virtual armies, in the form of 
millions of artificial identities that could 
support any personal, business, political, 
military, or terrorist agenda.” 
Which leads us to more recent developments 
and a couple of things Tim Hwang is working 
on…

Slide 48 
Another interesting area for abuse is Fake 
customer service account. In December 2012, 
we saw the telecoms provider EE apparently 
asking for mobile phone numners, postcodes 
and passwords via Twitter DM’s.  This was 
blogged about by Troy Hunt here… 
http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/12/ee-k-
dming-your-password-is-never-good.html  
What was more interesting as the @MyEECare 
account which sprang up. Had the people 
behind the fake account been truly malicious, 
they could have mimicked the real account and 
harvested a considerable amount of user data. 
“Update, 31 Dec 2012: There’s one other very, 
very important point I neglected to make and 
I’ve inadvertently demonstrated it perfectly in 
the image above. The @MyEECare account is 
fake and has been suspended in the 7 hours 
since I wrote the post. There’s now an 
@EESupport account doing the same thing; 
same avatar as @EE, same branding too. 
Obviously it’s not Twitter verified like the 
official account, but it’s convincing enough that 
were they to ask someone for their password 
via DM, I reckon there’s a damn good chance 
they’d get it. Your average consumer isn’t going 
to do their own due diligence on the account 
authenticity before sending personal data – 
particularly when it’s presented like these ones 
– and that’s a serious risk indeed” 
Slide 49 
And finally, after our BlackHat presentation 
(July 2013), two gentlemen approached me 
asking about the problem of social bots 
misdirecting emergency resources.  “A lie gets 
halfway around the world before the truth has 
a chance to get its pants on” 
The reminded me of a talk by Prof Rob Proctor 
at University of Manchester 
http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/social-media-not-
to-blame-for-inciting-rioters-08-dec-2011  
“Also according to the research team, rumours 
'break' quickly in Twitter and the mainstream 
media lag behind citizen reports. 
Examples include rumours the London Eye had 
been set on fire and animals had been released 
from the London Zoo – which both turned out 
to be untrue. 
Other stories turned out to be true such as the 
burning down of a Miss Selfridge shop in 
Manchester. 
Professor Procter added: "Only after a period of 
time does the influence of mainstream media 
organisations become critical for determining a 
rumour's credibility. 
"But we do find the mainstream media is 
perfectly capable of picking up and publishing 
unverified information from social media 
without adhering to the usual standard of fact 
checking. 
"Consequently, some stories of this nature, 
though never verified, go unchallenged."  
“How riot rumours spread on Twitter - Analysis 
of 2.6 million tweets shows Twitter is adept at 
correcting misinformation - particularly if the 
claim is that a tiger is on the loose in Primrose 
Hill “

Slide 50 
I already mentioned the Web Ecology project. 
On the back of that, Tim Hwang created an 
organization called Pacific Social to explore 
social networks a little further.   
www: http://pacsocial.com/  
Twitter: @pacsocial  
Slide 51 
For example, Tim had grown interested by the 
amount in which the bots had distorted the 
original graph of 500 users (left) from the 2011 
Social Bots competition. The graph on the right 
is what the social graph looked like after the 
competition… 
Slide 52 
Social Bridge
Building
so they’re examining whether it’s possible to 
use an army of social bots to stitch two 
separate online communities together, or keep 
people in touch… 
Slide 53 
Another concept they’re interested in is 
Emotional Contagion and more specifically, a 
concept Tim coined as “Happiness Buffering”.  
Their interest in this stems from the work of 
Nicholas Christakis, you may be familiar with 
his book, “Connected – The surprising power of 
our social networks and how they shape our 
lives”. 
“Renowned scientists Christakis and Fowler 
present compelling evidence for our profound 
influence on one another's tastes, health, 
wealth, happiness, beliefs, even weight, as they 
explain how social networks form and how they 
operate.” - http://connectedthebook.com/  
Getting back to “Happiness Buffering”, Tim 
wondered whether you could….

sentiment analysis) dipped below a certain 
level, the surrounding nodes could…

are less sad.

Social Penetration Testing
1. Spread information with small 
inaccuracies
2. See where they’re challenged & where 
they’re not challenged
3. Identify who’s most influential but 
worst at evaluating what is real
4. Target them
And finally he highlighted the potential for 
Social Penetration Testing.   
I’d encourage you to check out Tim’s HOPE 9 
talk, it’s both entertaining and informative.

Yazan Boshmaf
It would be remiss of me, not to mention Yazan 
Boshmaf from the University of British 
Columbia.  Yazan and team investigated social 
bots on Facebook which generated a number of 
headlines… 
Slide 60 
…including this one, “'Socialbots' steal 250GB 
of user data in Facebook invasion”, while 
there’s some sensationalism in the headline the 
message aligns nicely with the concerns Erhardt 
Greaff cited in “What We Should Do Before the 
Social Bots Take Over“ and hits on a general 
key themes; social bots can obtain otherwise 
private information and they can scale.

“To this end, we are currently investigating 
two directions from the defense side. The first 
involves understanding the factors that 
influence user decisions on befriending 
strangers, which is useful in designing user-
centered security controls that better 
communicate the risks of online threats.”
Boshmaf et al (2012)
Yazan and team were also among the first to 
recommend that future studies also need to 
focus on  ‘understanding the factors that 
influence user decisions on befriending 
strangers, which is useful in designing user-
centered security controls that better 
communicate the risks of online threats. “

Understanding User Behaviour is also 
something which the folks are the Secure & 
Trustworthy CyberSpace program (in the US) 
are examining and the Corporate Insider Threat 
project at Oxford University 
…so understanding more about human 
behaviour, the signs to look for and how bots 
(and other humans) can exploit them, is a 
worthwhile question to explore.  Indeed,  
“Understanding and accounting for human 
behavior” is recognized in one of the 5 key 
areas in Secure & Trustworthy Cyberspace 
(SaTC) 
• Scalability & compatibility 
• Policy generated secure collaboration 
• Security metrics driven education, design, 
dev, deployment 
• Resilient architectures

Slide 69 
I’ve got all my own teeth
We used the Social Ecology Project’s winning 
bot model. (Available under MIT license).  We 
rewrote and slightly modified it in python.  
The winning bot code was based on a young 
man, @JamesMTitus, we made some subtle 
changes (which I’ll discuss). The first change is 
that we based our bots on old ladies with  
mildy humour biographies.  We wanted to keep 
to the spirit of @JamesMTitus as much as 
possible, i.e. somewhat banal tweeting.
