ABSTRACT
Information about the geographic locality of IP preﬁxes
can be useful for understanding the issues related to IP
address allocation, aggregation, and BGP routing table
growth.
In this paper, we use traceroute data and geo-
graphic mappings of IP addresses to study the geographic
properties of IP preﬁxes and their implications on Internet
routing. We ﬁnd that (1) IP preﬁxes may be too coarse-
grained for expressing routing policies, (2) address allo-
cation policies and the granularity of routing contribute
signiﬁcantly to routing table size, and (3) not considering
the geographic diversity of contiguous preﬁxes may result
in overestimating the opportunities for aggregation in the
BGP routing table.

Introduction
Today’s Internet routing infrastructure achieves scalabil-
ity by expressing reachability for large groups of IP ad-
dresses using a single IP preﬁx in a route advertisement.
Today’s largest Internet routing tables provide reachability
to hundreds of millions of end hosts with nearly 200,000
routes [5]. IP addresses that are nearby in IP space may
be geographically or topologically diverse, and vice versa.
This paper quantiﬁes this lack of correspondence. Infor-
mation about the geographic location of hosts within IP
preﬁxes can also help us better understand many issues
related to IP address aggregation and allocation and their
effect on BGP routing table growth.
Our study uses extensive traceroutes and leverages IP-
to-geographic mapping techniques to examine the geo-
graphic properties of multiple destinations within a single
preﬁx. Our dataset includes traceroutes to at least 4 IP ad-
dresses within each preﬁx of the global routing table, as
well as traceroutes to 1.6 million unique Web clients and
servers that exchanged content over CoralCDN, a popular
peer-to-peer content distribution network [3].
Towards this goal of understanding the geographic prop-
erties of IP preﬁxes, this paper makes three ﬁndings. First,
an IP preﬁx may express only very coarse geographic in-
formation about the destinations (and networks) that it
comprises. This property of the geographic diversity of
hosts within a preﬁx is important for techniques that as-
sume that hosts within an IP preﬁx are topologically close.
As expected, we ﬁnd that “shorter” IP preﬁxes, which rep-
resent a larger portion of the IP address space, tend to
comprise destinations in a large number of geographic lo-
cations, spread over long distances. For example, more
than half the preﬁxes with mask lengths between 8 and
15 span a distance of more than 100 miles. More surpris-
ingly, we ﬁnd that “longer” preﬁxes, albeit a small fraction
of them, can be quite geographically diverse: about 1.4%
of the preﬁxes with mask lengths between 24 and 31 span
a distance of more than 100 miles, and some /24 preﬁxes
span distances of more than 10,000 miles!
Second, autonomous systems (ASes) commonly adver-
tise multiple discontiguous IP preﬁxes for networks in the
same geographic location. In this case, the Internet routing
table must carry multiple routes for a group of destinations
in a single geographic location and a single AS, because
the addresses cannot be expressed as a single IP preﬁx.
This ﬁnding suggests that an Internet routing infrastruc-
ture whose routing granularity more closely reﬂects ge-
ography could signiﬁcantly reduce the size of the global
routing tables. Additionally, fragmented address alloca-
tion explains 65% of the cases where a single AS was ad-
vertising discontiguous preﬁxes from the same location,
which suggests that IP address renumbering could signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the size of the BGP routing table.
Finally, ASes sometimes announce contiguous preﬁxes
from different geographic locations. Ongoing studies,
such as the CIDR Report [2], presume that all contiguous
preﬁxes originated by an AS should be aggregated into a
single IP preﬁx. However, these studies do not consider
whether these preﬁxes actually represent geographically
diverse networks that are intentionally represented as sep-
arate routes. By ignoring location information, the CIDR
Report may overestimate the opportunities for aggregation
by a factor of three.
2. Related Work
Padmanabhan et al. [9] develop a set of techniques to
map IP addresses to geographic locations. One of their
techniques “clusters” IP addresses at the granularity of an
IP preﬁx to map them to a location. The authors observe
that the accuracy of their method in mapping an IP address
is related to the geographic spread of the hosts within the

preﬁx containing that IP address. Our work aims to gain a
deeper understanding of geographic diversity of the hosts
within a single IP preﬁx.
The geographic locality of IP preﬁxes is signiﬁcant for
systems like Network Aware Clustering (NAC) [6], which
group hosts that belong to the same preﬁx of the BGP rout-
ing tables into clusters, which are used in applications like
content distribution and proxy positioning. These cluster-
ing schemes rely on the assumption that hosts within a pre-
ﬁx are likely to be topologically close and under the same
administrative domain. We investigate the validity of this
assumption in Section 4.1.
Earlier work has also studied impact of factors like IPv4
address allocation and aggregation on the growth of the
BGP routing table [1, 7]. Bu et al. [1] ﬁnd that address
fragmentation (where a set of preﬁxes originated by an AS
cannot be summarized by one preﬁx) is the biggest factor
contributing to BGP routing table growth. Our study also
reveals many instances where an AS announces discon-
tiguous preﬁxes, even from the same geographic location.
The CIDR Report studies contiguous preﬁxes an-
nounced by the same AS and the missed opportunities for
aggregation by ASes [2]. In our study, we ﬁnd that con-
tiguous preﬁxes announced by the same AS are sometimes
geographically far apart; aggregating such preﬁxes might
conﬂict with an AS’s trafﬁc engineering or load balancing
goals. Thus, the aggregation opportunities suggested by
the CIDR Report might not all be feasible.
3. Data
This paper uses three datasets generated by traceroute
measurements to study the relationship between IP pre-
ﬁxes and locality. We mapped IP addresses to IP preﬁxes
using longest-preﬁx matching on a BGP table from Route-
Views [8] from February 27, 2005. This table had approx-
imately 170,000 IP preﬁxes.
As shown in Table 1, Clients and Servers refer to tracer-
outes taken to Web clients and servers that exchanged con-
tent over CoralCDN, a peer-to-peer content distribution
network that receives approximately 10 million HTTP re-
quests per day from widely-dispersed clients [3]. The
client traces cover a 14-day period starting on February
13, 2005, while the server trace covers a single day (April
26, 2005). Each CoralCDN Web proxy—there are approx-
imately 225 such proxies deployed on PlanetLab [10]—
performed a traceroute to every client destination IP.
While these CoralCDN datasets provide a workload cor-
responding to a real user population, we also sought to
provide coverage of all IP preﬁxes from the RouteViews
table. For the Breadth dataset, we performed traceroutes
to 4 uniformly distributed IP addresses per advertised pre-
ﬁx, using 25 PlanetLab hosts as sources. Note that these
traceroutes traverse IP addresses from multiple preﬁxes.

Table 2: IP-to-location assignments.
We use the RouteViews table to map IP addresses to
their ASes and DNS naming heuristics to map IPs to lo-
cations, as described in Section 3.1. Table 2 characterizes
the number of IP addresses mapped to an AS number and
a location (at the city level). We call this location inher-
ited if the destination is not reachable itself (whereupon
we assign it to the location of its closest reachable up-
stream router instead). The inherited dataset is a subset
of mapped, which in turn is a subset of the destination IPs
in Table 1. Table 2 also shows the total number of unique
IP preﬁxes, ASes, and locations in each dataset.
3.1 Mapping IP addresses to locations
We use undns [11] to map IP addresses to locations.
undns extracts geographic information from a DNS
name, which is useful because network operators often
use geographically meaningful names for routers. For ex-
ample, a DNS name of the form qwest-gw.n54ny.ip.att.net
refers to an AT&T (AS 7018) router peering with Qwest,
located at an exchange point on 54th street in New York
City. Other studies have also used this approach [9].
Unfortunately, naming heuristics vary between ISPs,
and parsing is a manual process. ISPs may name routers
by city name or code, airport code, or some 4-to-6 let-
ter abbreviation for city and state.
In addition, ISPs in-
corporate such information in hostnames differently; even
a single AS may use multiple heuristics.
For exam-
ple, Verio (AS 2914) names gateways in one manner
(e.g., att-gw.nyc.verio.net) and customer addresses in an-
other (e.g., vl-101.a02.nycmny03.us.ce.verio.net). Router
names can also be ambiguous:
for example, nycmng-
washng.abilene.ucaid.edu is located in New York but
peers with a router in Washington, D.C. In such special
cases, we manually pinged routers from diverse locations
to better understand their ISP-speciﬁc naming heuristics.
undns version 0.1.27a includes manually written host-
name parsing rules for 247 ASes, mostly Tier-1 and Tier-2
ISPs in the US and Europe. We added support for 169 ad-
ditional ASes (including smaller ISPs) and expanded the

tool’s international coverage. The latter is especially im-
portant for the Clients dataset, which includes signiﬁcant
amounts of trafﬁc from Asia. We spot-checked location
estimates after running undns for some IP addresses in
known locations.
Given a city-level location estimate for a particular IP
address, we also assign to it the latitude and longitude co-
ordinates for that city, which allows us to estimate the dis-
tance between two IP addresses.
