I accidentally left the "Use Regex" option for "Find in Project" on and
searched for a string that resulted in an invalid regular expression, and the
resulting exception bubbled to the top of the stack:
    Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: /.run (DsEvent/: Unterminated group - results-model.coffee:180
I'd be happy to address this, but I'm not sure what the desired end behavior
is.
