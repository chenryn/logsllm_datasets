User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx fail to redirect I recently pass all my site to https
here is a sample of cv site conf

server {
   listen 80;
   server_name cv.host.com;
   root /www/cv/app;
   index index.html index.htm index.php;
   access_log /www/log/cv/nginx-access.log;
   error_log /www/log/cv/nginx-error.log;
   location /
   {
       try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
   }
   location ~ \.php$
   {
      include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
       fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
   }
   listen 443 ssl;
   ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/cv.host.com/fullchain.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/cv.host.com/privkey.pem;
   include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
   ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
   if ($scheme != "https") {
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
   } # managed by Certbot
}


But when i try to open http://cv.host.com my browser got redirected to https://host.com au lieu de https://cv.host.com

Ngninx seem to cal my default conf which is

server {
    listen  80 default_server;
    server_name _;    
    root /www/default/app;
    index index.html index.htm index.php;    
    access_log /www/log/default/nginx-access.log;
    error_log /www/log/default/nginx-error.log;    
    location /
    {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }    
    location ~ \.php$
    {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
    }    
    listen 443 ssl default_server;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/host.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/host.com/privkey.pem; 
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
    ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;    
    if ($scheme != "https") {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot
}


So when i ask http://cv.host.com i don't get the good site in https... is my config wrong? Any other way to redirect all to https?

Assistant: You can't put two vhosts on the same IP for ssl unless its using the same SSL cert.

This is due to how ssl works.. nginx doesn't know anything about the host header until it decrypts the stream. So when it connects at first it is hitting your default entry.
