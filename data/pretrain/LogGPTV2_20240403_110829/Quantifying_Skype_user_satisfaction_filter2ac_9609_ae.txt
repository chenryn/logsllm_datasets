the proportion of OFF periods that coincide with ON
periods of the other side, as depicted in Fig. 13. Since
the level of interactivity is computed separately for
each direction, the minimum of both is used because
it represents the worse satisfaction level.
Response Delay: Short response delay, i.e., one side re-
sponds immediately after the other side stops talking,
usually indicates the sound quality is good enough for
the parties to understand each other. Thus, if one
side starts talking when the other side is silent, we
consider it as a “response” to the previous burst from
the other side, and take the time diﬀerence between
the two adjacent bursts as the response delay, as de-
picted in Fig. 13. In this way, all the response delays in
the same direction can be averaged, and the larger of
the average response delays in both directions is used,
since longer response delay indicates poorer conversa-
tion quality.
Talk Burst Length: This deﬁnition may not be intuitive
at ﬁrst glance. We believe that people usually adapt
to low voice quality by slowing their talking speed, as
this should help the other side understand. Further-
more, if people need to repeat an idea due to poor
sound quality, they tend to explain the idea in another
way, which is simpler, but possibly longer. Both of the
above behavior patterns lead to longer speech bursts.
We capture such behavior by the larger of the aver-
age burst lengths in both directions, as longer bursts
indicate poorer quality. In order not to be biased by
long bursts, which are due to lengthy speech or error-
estimation in the speech detection, only bursts shorter
than 10 seconds are considered.
Fig. 13 illustrates the voice interactivity measures pro-
posed. Because our speech detection algorithm estimates
talk bursts in units of 0.1 second, a short pause between
words or sentences, either intentional or unintentional, could
split one burst into two. To ensure that the estimated user
activity resembles true human behavior, we treat successive
bursts as a single burst if the intervals between them are
shorter than 1 second in the computation of the interac-
tivity measures. We summarize some informative statistics
and voice interactivity measures of the collected sessions in
Table 5.

Now that we have 1) the User Satisfaction Index (Sec-
tion 4.5), which is based on the call duration compared to
the network QoS model, and 2) the interactivity measures,
which are inferred from the speech activity in a call. Since
these two indexes are obtained independently in completely
diﬀerent ways, and the speech detection algorithm does not
depend on any parameter related to call duration, we use
them to cross validate their representativeness of each other.
In the following, we check the correlation between the USI
and the voice interactivity measures with both graphical
plots and correlation coeﬃcients.
First, we note that short sessions,
i.e., shorter than 1
minute, tend to have very high indexes of responsiveness,
possibly because both parties attempt to speak regardless of
the sound quality during such a short conversation. Accord-
ingly, we ignore extreme cases whose responsiveness level
equals one. The scatter plot of the USI versus responsive-
ness is shown in Fig. 14(a). In the graph, the proportion of
low-responsiveness sessions decreases as the USI increases,
which supports our intuition that a higher USI indicates
higher responsiveness.
Fig. 14(b) shows that response delays are also strongly
related to the USI, as longer response delay corresponds to
lower USI. The plot shows a threshold eﬀect in that the av-
erage response delay does not diﬀer signiﬁcantly for USIs
higher than 8. This is plausible, as response delay certainly
does not decrease unboundedly, even if the voice quality is
perfect. Fig. 14(c) shows that the average talk burst length
consistently increases as the USI drops. As explained ear-
lier, we consider that this behavior is due to the slow-paced
conversations and longer explanations caused by poor sound
quality.
We also performed statistical tests to conﬁrm the associ-
ation between the USI and the voice interactivity measures.
Three measures, Pearson’s product moment correlation co-
eﬃcient, Kendall’s τ , and Spearman’s ρ, were computed, as
shown in Table 6. All correlation tests reject the null hy-
pothesis that an association does not exist at the 0.01 level.
Furthermore, the three tests support each other with coeﬃ-
cients of the same sign and approximate magnitude.

6. CONCLUSION
Understanding user satisfaction is essential for the devel-
opment of QoS-sensitive applications. The proposed USI
model captures the level of satisfaction without the over-
heads of the traditional approaches, i.e., requiring access to
speech signals.
It also captures factors other than signal
degradation, such as talk echo, conversational delay, and
subconscious reactions.
Results of the validation tests using a set of independent
measures derived from user interactivities show a strong cor-
relation between the call durations and user interactivities.
This suggests that the USI based on call duration is signiﬁ-
cantly representative of Skype user satisfaction.
The best feature of the USI is that its parameters are eas-
ily accessible and computable online. Therefore, in addition
to evaluating the performance of QoS-sensitive applications,
the USI can be implemented as part of applications to allow
adaptation for optimal user satisfaction in real time.
