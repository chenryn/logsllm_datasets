# Incident Response Playbook Template
### Incident Type
Personal Data Breach
### Introduction
This playbook is provided as a template to customers using AWS products and who are building their incident response capability. You should customize this template to suit your particular needs, risks, available tools and work processes.
Security and Compliance is a shared responsibility between you and AWS. AWS is responsible for “Security of the Cloud”, while you are responsible for “Security in the Cloud”. For more information on the shared responsibility model, [please review our documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).
You are responsible for making your own independent assessment of the information in this document. This document: (a) is for informational purposes only, (b) references current AWS product offerings and practices, which are subject to change without notice, and (c) does not create any commitments or assurances from AWS and its affiliates, suppliers or licensors. This document is provided “as is” without warranties, representations, or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied. The responsibilities and liabilities of AWS to its customers are controlled by AWS agreements, and this document is not part of, nor does it modify, any agreement between AWS and its customers.
## Summary
### This Playbook
This playbook outlines response steps for Personal Data Breach incidents.  These steps are based on the [NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf) (Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2) that can be used to:
* Gather evidence
* Contain and then eradicate the incident
* Recover from the incident
* Conduct post-incident activities, including post-mortem and feedback processes
Interested readers may also refer to the [AWS Security Incident Response Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-security-incident-response-guide/welcome.html) which contains additional resources.
Once you have customized this playbook to meet your needs, it is important that you test the playbook (e.g., Game Days) and any automation (functional tests), update as necessary to achieve the desired results, and then publish to your knowledge management system and train all responders.
Note that some of the incident response steps noted in each scenario may incur costs in your AWS account(s) for services used in either preparing for, or responding to incidents. Customizing these scenarios and testing them will help you to determine if additional costs will be incurred. You can use [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) and look at costs incurred over a particular time frame (such as when running Game Days) to establish what the possible impact might be.

> Besides the procedures outlined in this playbook, your jurisdiction may have requirements and/or legislation about privacy laws (e.g. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) etc). It may require you to report a security breach and the suspected or confirmed loss or theft of any material or records data. We recommend establishing if this applies to your organization before operationalising this playbook.

In reviewing this playbook, you will find steps that involve processes that you may not have in place today. Proactively preparing for incidents means you need the right resource configurations, tools and services in place that allow you to respond to an incident.
The next section will provide a summary of this incident type, and then cover the five steps (parts 1 - 5) for handling credential compromise.
### This Incident Type
A data breach occurs where there is an unauthorised access to or disclosure of personal information, or information is lost in circumstances where unauthorised access or disclosure is likely that could result in harm or inconvenience, such as fraud or identity theft, to an individual.
**What is personal data?**
All information that can identify an individual is personal data, directly or indirectly. One example is a person’s name, but also things such as login-ID, birthdate, address, email-address, phone number, social-security number, etc. The concept of personal data goes even further: behavioral or performance data of an individual person (like geo-location, performance-metrics, working hours, device IDs, etc.) are all personal data. The rule of thumb is that if you’re thinking about whether some element could be personal data–it usually is! You should verify whether your systems handle or store personal data. If you have internal teams that can help you with this (legal, policy) check with them. If you do not, you can create and document your own definition based on existing definitions today, such as [Article 4 of the GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-4-definitions/), or the [definition used in various NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/PII) Special Publications. Commonly, the personal data referred to in this playbook is known as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
[Art. 4 (1) of GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/article-4-definitions/) defines personal data as:
(1) ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
## Incident Response Process
### Part 1: Acquire, Preserve, Document Evidence
>**Note**
>
> It is important to exercise caution when collecting information during a PII data breach, as personal information must not be recorded. Instead, focus on collecting contextual information surrounding the breach to aid in the investigation.
1. You become aware that there has been a possible unintended personal data breach. This information could come via different means, for example:
    1. PII was accidentally logged or found in the reporting systems, such as application log files, of your security operations.
    2. An internal ticketing system (the sources of the ticket are varied and could include any of the means below)
    3. A message from a contractor or third-party service provider
    4. From an alert in one of your own monitoring systems, either internal or external, to AWS. For example, in AWS, this might include an AWS Config managed rule, AWS CloudTrail via Amazon EventBridge or Amazon CloudWatch Events and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), via Amazon Macie, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub or a similar service.
    5. From an alert in one of your data loss prevention (DLP) systems
    6. From a threat actor (for example, requesting a ransom or they will disclose data)
    7. From a security researcher
    8. Via an anonymous tip
    9. From a public news article in the press, on a blog, or in the news
2. Confirm a ticket/case has been raised for the incident. If not, manually raise one.
3. Determine the sensitivity of the impacted data and record specific AWS resources that were the origin of the breach. It is also essential to determine the number of individuals who were affected by the incident with certainty (*Contextual information is often a key factors in determining the severity of an incident within an Organization*):
    1. *Nature of personal data:* Your organization's [data classification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/data-classification/data-classification.html) standards should also define how to handle a Personal Identifiable Information (PII) data breach. The steps or actions you take may vary depending on the sensitivity/classification of the data involved in the breach, you will refer to your data classification and handling policies to determine this. These standards determine the necessary level of protection for different types of information based on their sensitivity. For example, the level of seriousness for a data breach involving sensitive personal health information of an individual would be greater than that of a breach involving publicly available data:
        1. According to your jurisdiction legal requirements and data classification specifications, it may be necessary to categorize breached data as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Publicly Available Information (PAI). Here are few examples:
            - You should consider the breached personal data as PII unless proven otherwise.
            - A common example of PAI is information that is readily accessible to the public, such as a person's name, address, and phone number which is listed in a public directory or on social media platforms.
    2. *Number of AWS resources involved:* Below are a few potential scenarios:
        1. An Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon RDS database was compromised, containing sensitive information such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, banking information, or medical records.
        2. An Amazon Elasticsearch index was lost or compromised, containing personally identifiable information (PII) that should not be publicly accessible.
        3. An Amazon S3 bucket containing personally identifiable information (PII) was compromised and is publicly available. Here are two example scenarios:
            -  The bucket was made publicly accessible when it should not have been.
            -  The bucket may not have been publicly accessible, but data was still exfiltrated due to credential leakage or an incorrectly configured system that accessed the data and made it publicly available.
    3.  *Number of individual affected:* This information may help your organization to assess the impact on affected individuals and take appropriate measures to mitigate the consequences, such as offering identity theft protection services or providing timely notifications to prevent further harm.
4. The collection of evidence (AWS CloudTrail logs, AWS Config rules finding etc.) in relation to AWS data services must adhere to a strict chain of custody to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data as per your jurisdiction legal requirements. Evidence and artifacts can consist of, but aren’t limited to:
    1. All EC2 instance metadata
    2. Amazon EBS disk snapshots
    3. EBS disks streamed to S3
    4. Memory dumps
    5. Memory captured through hibernation on the root EBS volume
    6. CloudTrail logs
    7. AWS Config rule findings
    8. Amazon Route 53 DNS resolver query logs
    9. VPC Flow Logs
    10. AWS Security Hub findings
    11. Elastic Load Balancing access logs
    12. AWS WAF logs
    13. Custom application logs
    14. System logs
    15. Security logs
    16. Any third-party logs
5. At this point, you may not know the cause of data breach:
    1. Extrusion by attackers —an attackers penetrated the security perimeter and,gain access to sensitive personal data.
    2. Insider threats — a malicious insider, or an attacker who has compromised a privileged user accounts, abuses their permissions and attempts to move data outside the organization.
    3. Unintentional or negligent data exposure — an employees who lose sensitive data in public, provide open Internet access to data, or fail to restrict access per organizational policies.
6. If you are already aware of AWS resources involved (like Amazon S3 or Amazon RDS etc) and , Firstly move to **Part 2** to contain the incident. Once that is done, return here and then move on to step 5. If you have not established which bucket(s) are involved, continue to step 4.
7. If you are *not aware* of the AWS resources involved incident personal data breach within an AWS account, follow these steps:
    1. Check AWS services used for data storage and processing, such as Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, etc.
    2. Employ the use of internal tools to associate the data with a specific storage location, such as by checking a Configuration Management Database (CMDB).
    3. Review AWS CloudTrail logs for suspicious activity or unauthorized access.
    4. Examine the findings of Amazon GuardDuty in either the source AWS account or the central security monitoring account, focusing specifically on any recent findings, regardless of whether AWS resources are implicated in the incident.
    5. Additionally, review AWS CloudTrail logs to detect any unauthorized access or changes to parameters/secrets in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and AWS Secrets Manager. This is important as these services may act as the starting point for managing credentials to access data storage services. To get you started, few examples are:

    6. Please review the access logs for your S3 buckets to identify any unintended or unidentified activity. Here are a few examples of documentation to help you get started:
