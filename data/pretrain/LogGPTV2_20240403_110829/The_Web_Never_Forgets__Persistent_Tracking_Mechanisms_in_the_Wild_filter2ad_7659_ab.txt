that persists.
Figure 2 depicts the stages of respawning by Local Shared
Objects (LSOs), also known as Flash cookies. Whenever
a user visits a site that uses evercookies, the site issues an
ID and stores it in multiple storage mechanisms, including
cookies, LSOs and localStorage. In Figure 2a, the value 123
is stored in both HTTP and Flash cookies. When the user
removes her HTTP cookie (Figure 2b), the website places
a cookie with the same value (123) by reading the ID value

sites among the top 10K sites employing practices such
as font probing and the use of Flash to circumvent proxy
servers [37]. Acar et al. found that 404 sites in the top mil-
lion deployed JavaScript-based ﬁngerprinting and 145 sites
of the top 10,000 sites leveraged Flash-based ﬁngerprint-
ing [6].
In comparison to these studies, we focus on canvas ﬁn-
gerprinting, which, to the best of our knowledge, has never
been reported to be found in the wild and is much harder
to block.
Several studies have looked at the use of Flash cook-
ies (LSOs) and, in particular, the use of Flash cookies to
respawn HTTP cookies [43, 7, 30]. Soltani et al. uncovered
the ﬁrst use of respawning by Flash cookies [43], and in a
follow-up study, Ayenson et al. found the ﬁrst use of cache
ETags and localStorage for respawning [7]. McDonald and
Cranor analyzed the landing pages of 100 popular websites,
plus 500 randomly-selected websites, and found two cases
of respawning in the top 100 websites and no respawning
in the randomly selected 500 sites [30]. In a recent study,
Sorensen analyzed the use of cache as a persistent storage
mechanism and found several instances of HTTP cookies
respawned from cached page content [44]. The main dif-
ference between our study and the papers mentioned here
is that we automated respawning detection as explained in
Section 4, and this allowed us to analyze orders of magnitude
more sites.
Olejnik et al.
studied cookie syncing (which they call
cookie matching) [38]. They found that over 100 cookie
syncing events happen on the top 100 sites. In comparison
to their work, our study of cookie syncing (i) is large-scale,
covering 3,000 sites, (ii) is based on crawling rather than
crowd-sourcing, allowing easier comparative measurements
over time and (iii) presents a global view, in that we go be-
yond detecting individual sync events and are able to cap-
ture and analyze the propagation of IDs through the tracking
ecosystem. Further, we study how cookie syncing interacts
with respawning, leading to more persistent tracking and
widening the eﬀects of these two vulnerabilities taken indi-
vidually.
Program analysis of JavaScript (i.e., static analysis and
dynamic analysis) is a common technique in web security
[46]. A few studies have used such techniques for blocking
or measuring web trackers. Orr et al. use static analysis
to detect and block JavaScript-loaded ads [39]. Tran et al.
use dynamic taint analysis to detect various privacy-invasive
behaviors [48]. Acar et al. use behavioral analysis to detect
ﬁngerprinting scripts that employ font probing [6].
Defenses. Besson et al.
[10] examined the theoretical
boundaries of ﬁngerprinting defenses using Quantiﬁed In-
formation Flow. Following a more practical approach, Niki-
forakis and others developed a defense called PriVaricator
to prevent linkability from ﬁngerprinters by randomizing
browser features such as plugins [36]. Finally, Unger et al.
[50], studied the potentials of browser ﬁngerprinting as a
defense mechanism against HTTP(S) session hijacking.
In Section 6.1 we discuss how existing privacy tools defend
against the advanced tracking mechanisms we study.
Behavioral targeting without tracking. Several pa-
pers have addressed the question of whether all this tracking
is in fact necessary — they proposed ways to achieve the
purported goals of third-party tracking, primarily targeted
advertising, without server-side proﬁles.
In Adnostic, the
browser continually updates a behavioral proﬁle of the user
based on browsing activity, and targeting is done locally [14].
PrivAd has a similar model, but includes a trusted party that
attempts to anonymize the client [20]. RePriv has the more
general goal of enabling personalization via interest proﬁling
in the browser [19]. Bilenko et al. propose a model in which
the user’s proﬁle and recent browsing history is stored in a
cookie [11]. Other work on similar lines includes [8, 49, 34].
3. CANVAS FINGERPRINTING
Canvas ﬁngerprinting works by drawing text onto canvas
and reading the rendered image data back. In the following
experiments we used an instrumented Firefox browser that
we built by modifying the source code and logged all the
function calls that might be used for canvas ﬁngerprinting.
3.1 Methodology and Data collection
Our methodology can be divided into two main steps. In
the ﬁrst, we identiﬁed the ways we can detect canvas ﬁn-
gerprinting, developed a crawler based on an instrumented
browser and ran exploratory crawls. This stage allowed us
to develop a formal and automated method based on the
early ﬁndings. In the second step, we applied the analysis
method we distilled from the early ﬁndings and nearly fully
automated the detection of canvas ﬁngerprinting.
Mowery and Shacham used fillText and ToDataURL
methods to draw text and read image data respectively [32].
We logged the return value of ToDataURL and, in order to
ﬁnd out the strings drawn onto the canvas, we logged the
arguments of fillText and strokeText methods1.
the caller
We logged the URL of
script and the
line number of the calling (initiator) code using Fire-
fox’s nsContentUtils::GetCurrentJSContext and nsJSU-
tils::GetCallingLocation methods. This allowed us to
precisely attribute the ﬁngerprinting attempt to the respon-
sible script and the code segment. All function call logs were
parsed and combined in a SQLite database that allowed us
to eﬃciently analyze the crawl data. For each visit, we also
added cookies, localStorage items, cache metadata, HTTP
request/response headers and request bodies to the SQLite
database. We used mitmproxy 2 to capture HTTP data and
parsed data accumulated in the proﬁle folder for other data
such as cookies, localStorage and cache data. The aggre-
gated data were used in the early stage analysis for canvas
ﬁngerprinting and evercookie detection, which is explained
in Section 4.2. Our browser modiﬁcations for Firefox con-
sist of mere 33 lines of code, spread across four ﬁles and the
performance overhead of the modiﬁcations is minimal.
We crawled the home pages of the top 100,000 Alexa
sites with the instrumented Firefox browser between 1-5
May 2014. We used Selenium [5] to drive browsers to sites
and ran multiple Firefox instances in parallel to reduce the
1In addition to these three methods we intercepted calls to
MozFetchAsStream, getImageData and ExtractData meth-
ods which can be used to extract canvas image data. But we
did not put eﬀort into recording the extracted image data
for three reasons: they were not used in the original can-
vas ﬁngerprinting paper [32], they are less convenient for
ﬁngerprinting (requires extra steps), and we did not ﬁnd
any script that uses these methods and ﬁngerprints other
browser properties in the initial experiments.

crawl time.
Implementing some basic optimizations and
a naive load limiting check, we were able to run up to 30
browsers in parallel on a 4-core 8GB desktop machine run-
ning GNU/Linux operating system. The modiﬁed browsers
were run in a chroot jail to limit the eﬀects of the host op-
erating system.
False positive removal The Canvas API is used by
many benign scripts to draw images, create animations or
store content for games. During our crawls we found in-
teresting use cases, such as generating dynamic favicons,
creating tag clouds, and checking font smoothing support.
By examining the distinctive features of false positives and
the ﬁngerprinting scripts found in the initial experiments,
we distilled the following conditions for ﬁltering out false
positives:
• There should be both ToDataURL and fillText (or
strokeText) method calls and both calls should come
from the same URL.
• The canvas image(s) read by the script should con-
tain more than one color and its(their) aggregate size
should be greater than 16x16 pixels.
• The image should not be requested in a lossy compres-
sion format such as JPEG.
Checking the origin of the script for both read and write
access helped us to remove scripts that use canvas for only
generating images but not reading them or vice versa. Al-
though it is possible that two scripts from the same domain
can divide the work to circumvent our detection method, we
accepted that as a limitation.
Enforcing a 16x16 pixel size limit allowed us to ﬁlter out
scripts that read too few pixels to eﬃciently extract the
canvas ﬁngerprint. Although there are 28192 possible color
combinations for a 16x16 pixel image3, operating systems or
font libraries only apply anti-aliasing (which is an important
source of diversity for canvas ﬁngerprinting) to text larger
than a minimum font size.4
The ﬁnal check was to ﬁlter out cases where canvas image
data is requested in a lossy compression format. Under a
lossy compression scheme, the returned image may lose the
subtle diﬀerences that are essential for ﬁngerprinting.
Applying these checks, we reduced the false positive ratio
to zero for the 100,000 crawl, upon which we perform our
primary analysis. We used static analysis to make sure the
scripts we ﬂagged as canvas ﬁngerprinting were also collect-
ing other high-entropy browser properties such as plugins,
navigator features and screen dimensions. It should be noted
that in other pilot crawls (beyond 100K), we witnessed some
false positives that our conditions failed to remove. Also,
we believe that a determined tracker may potentially cir-
cumvent our detection steps using more advanced but less
reliable attacks such as pixel stealing using SVG ﬁlters [45]
or CSS shaders [24].

3.2 Results
Table 1 shows the prevalence of the canvas ﬁngerprinting
scripts found during the home page crawl of the Top Alexa
100,000 sites. We found that more than 5.5% of crawled
sites actively ran canvas ﬁngerprinting scripts on their home
pages. Although the overwhelming majority (95%) of the
scripts belong to a single provider (addthis.com), we discov-
ered a total of 20 canvas ﬁngerprinting provider domains, ac-
tive on 5542 of the top 100,000 sites5. Of these, 11 provider
domains, encompassing 5532 sites, are third parties. Based
on these providers’ websites, they appear to be companies
that deploy ﬁngerprinting as part of some other service
rather than oﬀering ﬁngerprinting directly as a service to
ﬁrst parties. We found that the other nine provider do-
mains (active on 10 sites) are in-house ﬁngerprinting scripts
deployed by ﬁrst parties. Note that our crawl in this paper
was limited to home pages. A deeper crawl covering internal
pages of the crawled sites could ﬁnd a higher percentage of
ﬁngerprinting.

The 5.5% prevalence is much higher than what other
ﬁngerprinting measurement studies had previously found
(0.4% [37], 0.4%, 1.5% [6]), although these studies may not
be directly comparable due to the diﬀerences in methodol-
ogy and data collection. Also note that canvas ﬁngerprinting
was ﬁrst used by AddThis between January 15 to February
1st, 2014, 6 which was after all the mentioned studies.

script is served from a content delivery network (CDN) and
additional analysis was needed to distinguish between dif-
ferent providers serving from the same (CDN) domain. In-
cluding these cases would only change the number of unique
sites with canvas ﬁngerprinting to 5552 (from 5542).
