### Issue: Unable to Launch Python from Command Line

**Description:**
I am experiencing a problem launching Python from the command line on one of my machines. When I attempt to run `python` from the command line, there is no response; I do not receive a "command not found" message, and the console does not launch. The only way to open the Python console is by running `C:\Python34\python.exe` directly. Even when I am in the Python directory, using the `python` command does not work, but `python.exe` launches in a new window.

This issue is specific to one machine; on my other machine, I can run Python correctly, and the console launches in the same command prompt window from which the `python` command was executed.

**Environment:**
- **Operating System:** Windows 8.1 x64
- **Python Version:** 3.4.2

**PATH Configuration:**
The `PATH` environment variable is set to:
```
C:\Python34\;C:\Python34\Scripts;...
```
Running `where python` returns `C:\Python34\python.exe`, and other commands (such as `javac`) that are imported through the `PATH` work correctly.

**Steps Taken:**
1. **Reinstallation:**
   - Completely reinstalled Python, both with x86 and x64 versions.
   - Copied the installation from my second machine and manually set the `PATH` variables.
   
2. **Verification:**
   - Confirmed that the `PATH` is correctly set and that `python.exe` is located at `C:\Python34\python.exe`.
   - Verified that other commands (e.g., `javac`) imported through the `PATH` work correctly.

**Resolution:**
Since no feasible solution was found after two days, I decided to:
- Wipe all registry keys containing 'python'.
- Remove some files that were not part of other programs.
- Reinstall Python.

This resolved the issue, and I can now launch Python from the command line without any problems.

**Request for Further Help:**
If anyone has encountered this issue and found a less drastic solution, or if you know the true cause of this behavior, please share it here for future reference.

Thank you!
