I am constructing this in my main menu structure:
                {
                    label: 'Delete',
                    accelerator: 'Backspace',
                    click: function () {
                        var focusedWindow = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow();
                        focusedWindow.webContents.send('remove', 'removing');
                    }
Now I would like to use The Backspace AND the Delete keys as an accelerator.
Have tried several combination for the accelerator, like:
`accelerator: 'Alt+Backspace,Alt+Delete'`
or
    accelerator: 'Alt+Backspace'
    accelerator: 'Alt+Delete'
But with both attempts, Electron just used the second one. Is there really now
way how we can use two keys for the same Accelerator?
