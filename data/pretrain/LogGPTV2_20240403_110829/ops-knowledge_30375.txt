User:  Please list a network security policy, including provisions for firewalls, intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning, etc.
Assistant: The following is a possible network security strategy, including regulations on firewalls, intrusion detection, vulnerability scanning, etc.: 1. Firewall regulations: - Firewalls must be set up for traffic control and attack defense at the entrance of the entire network segment, and security rules must be modified regularly; - Prohibit unauthorized users from directly accessing the internal network from the external network to prevent attacks and information leakage; - Firewalls and NAT conversion must be set up at the external network exit to prevent the IP addresses in the internal network from being exposed to the external network; - Regularly scan the firewall for vulnerabilities and Security assessment, timely repair of vulnerabilities and enhanced protection. 2. Intrusion detection regulations: - All hosts must install an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and report attacks such as malicious behaviors and exploits; - The IDS must be able to monitor traffic and logs in real time, and timely alarm and block attacks; - The IDS system must regularly update the rule base and software versions to adapt to the latest attack methods and exploit techniques; - Set up security logs and auditing functions in the network and hosts to view and analyze the source and process of malicious behavior. 3. Vulnerability scanning regulations: - Regularly conduct vulnerability scanning and assessment of systems and applications, and deal with discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner; - Scanning scope includes all hosts, devices, services and applications, especially commonly used web servers, databases and other Systems accessible from the public network; - Scanning tools must have the ability to identify and verify vulnerabilities, and generate detailed reports and recommendations; balance between.
