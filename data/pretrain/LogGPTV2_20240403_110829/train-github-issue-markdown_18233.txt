  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
Normal inputs have 32px in height. `disableUnderline` removes the 2 px at the
bottom, resulting in a component of 30px height. This has a few issues:
  * A `disableUnderline` component doesn't align well alongside a row of underlined components
  * 30px breaks vertical rhythm, as it's not a multiple of the theme unit.
I'm willing to submit a PR to add the missing 2px if this change is ok.
