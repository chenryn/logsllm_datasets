Question: When implementing Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), system architects must consider certain constraints. One such constraint is that memory segments usually need to start at a page boundary. What is a potential advantage and a disadvantage of this requirement? (Select one advantage and one disadvantage)
"A": "Advantage: Improves the efficiency of memory access as it aligns with the system's page size.",
"B": "Advantage: Allows for non-contiguous memory allocation, reducing the risk of buffer overflow attacks.",
"C": "Disadvantage: Limits the randomness of ASLR as addresses must align with page boundaries.",
"D": "Disadvantage: Increases the overall memory usage due to the need for encryption of page boundaries."
Answer: AC
