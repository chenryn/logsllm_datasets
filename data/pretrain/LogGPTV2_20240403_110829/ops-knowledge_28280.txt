Question: "A development team is working on a web form that accepts user-generated content to be displayed on a public blog. The form allows users to input text with basic formatting options. To prevent the improper neutralization of comment delimiters, which could lead to security vulnerabilities, what measures should the development team implement?"
 "A": "Develop a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications, reject any input that does not, and consider properties such as length and type of input."
 "B": "Allow all user inputs without validation to ensure freedom of expression and rely on automated moderation tools to flag inappropriate content."
 "C": "Encode output by escaping all characters that do not pass an allowlist and wrap arguments in quotes after the escaping/filtering step."
 "D": "Permit users to submit any form of input, including scripts and HTML tags, assuming that client-side scripting will handle any potential security issues."
