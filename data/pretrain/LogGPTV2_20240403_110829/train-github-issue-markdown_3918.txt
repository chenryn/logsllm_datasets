I tried `webContents.capturePage`, but it can only capture the "visible" part
of the page. If the height of your html node is larger than the BrowserWindow
(or when there's a scroll bar), the overflow part is not included in the
captured image. Is there any way to capture the whole page?
### Expected behavior
`webContents.capturePage` take a snapshot of the whole complete webpage
### Actual behavior
only visible part is captured.
### How to reproduce
                const remote = require('electron').remote;
                const webContents = remote.getCurrentWebContents();
                webContents.capturePage({
                    x: 0,
                    y: 0,
                    width: 1000,
                    height: 2000
                }, (img) => {
                    remote.require('fs')
                        .writeFile(TEMP_URL, img.toPng());
                });
