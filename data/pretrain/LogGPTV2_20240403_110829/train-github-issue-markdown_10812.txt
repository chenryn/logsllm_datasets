The code below is taken from the examples and works correctly with angular
Dart version 2.0.0-alpha.27 (after updating the injector).
    @View(template: '''
    My name: {{ myName }}
    Friends:
          {{ name }}
     3">You have many friends!
    ''',
    directives: const [NgFor,NgIf]
    )
Using angular2: '>= 2.0.0-alpha.28' or '2.0.0-alpha.29' the code fails at
NgFor, NgIf with:
    Unsupported directive record
Using angular2: '2.0.0-alpha.30' the code fails with
    Unsupported directive record in [friendNames in ]
