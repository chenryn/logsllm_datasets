User: By given an entity ID , I will query by models = Model.get_by_id(id). However, I find out that some time it will not return result collectly.
Is there any alternative or recommended method to query by entity ID in Google App Engine, python?
Assistant: get_by_id() always get the object, if the passed object is a valid id of object and if the objects exists in the datastore. 
id can be got by object.key.id in the templat
else you always have the object.get(key).
