Since version 0.193, the Debian package for the Atom editor has been experiencing issues. Specifically, the Atom editor installed via this package is not functioning as expected.

In versions following 0.193, the editor launches with the Chromium DevTools open by default (refer to the attached screenshot). The error message from the latest Git build (commit: `bc0e5ad`) is as follows:

```
Error: Cannot find module '../build/Release/scrollbar-style-observer.node'

```

Upon inspection, the `.deb` file generated using the `script/grunt mkdeb` command (refer to `atom-0.197-deb-content.txt`) does not include the required `scrollbar-style-observer.node` file. This issue also affects the `.deb` file distributed through the official website. In contrast, the `.deb` file for version 0.193 (refer to `atom-0.193-deb-content.txt`) includes this file.

It appears that there may be a problem in the build process. It would be greatly appreciated if a functional version of the editor could be made available again.
