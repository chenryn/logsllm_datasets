Since 0.193 (last working version) the debian package is broken, or better:
the atom editor which is installed via the package is broken.
In X > 0.193 the editor starts per defaults with the chromium dev tools open
(see attached screenshot). The following snipplets are from the latest git
build (latest commit: `bc0e5ad`). The console states the following
error/warning:

Indeed the .deb which was build via script/grunt mkdeb contains the follwing
files (seee atom-0.197-deb-content.txt) - the missing scrollbar-style-
observer.node is not there. (BTW: The .deb distributed via the official
website is also affected). Compared these two debs with the deb from 0.193 the
file is there (atom-0.193-deb-content.txt).
For me it looks like, as if something in the build process is broken and it
would be cool to have a working editor back :-)
