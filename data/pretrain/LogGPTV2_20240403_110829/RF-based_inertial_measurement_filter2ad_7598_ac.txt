RIM, leading to an overestimated factor of 1/cos α in distance esti-
mation. In terms of our 6-element circular array, the overestimated
error will be 1.20% on average, assuming the moving directions are
uniformly distributed in [0◦, 360◦], and reaches the worst of 3.53%
when the deviation angle α = 15◦, which is tolerable in practice.
The deviation angle may be resolvable by quantitatively comparing
the reduced TRRS to the expected value of perfect alignment, which
we keep as future work.
The above discussion assumes that the Rx is moving, listening
to a static Tx. RIM also applies to the opposite case when the Tx is
moving with a static Rx measuring CSI due to channel reciprocity
[39]. In either case, RIM estimates the motion of the moving device,
be it the Tx or Rx. This is a useful feature for certain applications,
e.g., in drone tracking where the drone may serve as a mobile AP
(the Tx) rather than an Rx.
4 MEASURING MOTION
The millimeter resolution antenna alignment underpins inertial
estimation in centimeter accuracy in practice. This section presents
how to measure motions on this basis. We first examine whether
movement exists. If yes, we then attempt to obtain the alignment
matrix of each antenna pair and accordingly determine when and
which pairs are well aligned. From the aligned pairs, we will derive
the distance, heading direction, and angle of rotation if there is any.

celerometer (Acc) and gyroscope (Gyr) that both fail to detect the
three transient stops during movements.
4.1 Detecting Movement
It is straightforward to detect antenna movement from TRRS, since
it is, with the virtual massive antennas, highly sensitive to arbitrary
location changes. Yet for movement detection, we only need to
examine the TRRS for one single antenna based on its own mea-
surements. Specifically, we calculate κ(Pi(t), Pi(t − lmv)), the TRRS
between the current measurement and the one lmv seconds ago.
lmv is the time lag chosen as a conservative period during which
location would change by at least millimeters if motion happens.
For example, if the antenna is moving at 1 m/s, a time lag of 0.01
second would expect a movement of 1 cm. Fig. 7 illustrates an ex-
ample of a stop-and-go trace. As seen, there is a clear gap between
the TRRSs for movement and non-movement. Thus we can apply a
threshold to detect movement, as indicated by the red horizontal
line in Fig. 7. The thresholding works generally because the TRRS
based on the same antenna always touches close to 1 when it is
static and decreases with movement.
4.2 Tracking Alignment Delay
Given an alignment matrix, we need to identify the TRRS peaks of
interests that indicate the time lags of antenna alignment. For an
ideal case, we can pinpoint the time lags corresponding to the max-
imum values in each column of the TRRS matrix as the alignment
delays. In practice, however, the maximum values could deviate
from the true delays due to measurement noise, packet loss, or wag-
ging movements, etc, and thus an approach is needed to robustly
track the peak sequence corresponding to the alignment delays. To
this end, we propose a novel algorithm based on dynamic program-
ming, which has been widely used to solve pitch tracking problems
in signal processing [48]. When applying in our case, however, it
still needs elaborate design.
For clarity, we simplify the notation of the TRRS matrix G for
two antennas from time t1 to tT as Q = [qi] where qi = [qil], i ∈
[1,T], l ∈ [−W ,W ]. As shown in Fig. 8a, now suppose we want to
search the best path of the TRRS peaks from time point ti to tj,
denoted as qi (cid:123) qj. Define a score of the optimal path qi (cid:123) qj
that ends at point qjn as S(qi (cid:123) qjn). Our approach is to search
all 2W possible candidate paths qi (cid:123) qjn that end at time lags
n ∈ [−W ,W ] and then select the best one among all.
Suppose we already have all the optimal paths from ti to tk, each
ending at qkl , l ∈ [−W ,W ], and the optimal paths from tk to tj,

each starting at qkl and all ending at qjn, then we have
(cid:8)S(qi (cid:123) qkl) + S(qkl (cid:123) qjn)(cid:9),
l ∈[−W ,W ]
S(qi (cid:123) qjn) = max
(6)
which stands for the score of the optimal path from qi (cid:123) qjn since
S(qi (cid:123) qkl) and S(qkl (cid:123) qjn) are both the scores of the respective
optimal paths. When k = j − 1, the score of the peak transition
between subsequent columns qkl and qjn is calculated as
S(qkl (cid:123) qjn) = ekl + ejn + ωC(qkl , qjn)
(7)
where ekl and eln are the TRRS values at qkl and qln respectively.
C(qkl , qjn) is the cost for stepping from qkl to qjn and is simply
defined as C(qkl , qjn) = ||l−n||
. ω is a negative weighting factor
2W
for the cost. The designation of the cost function punishes jumpy
peaks. The rationale is that in general cases the moving speed (thus
the aligned delays) will not fluctuate too much within successive
measurements.
Once we have the scores for paths qi (cid:123) qjn for any n ∈
[−W ,W ], the best path from qi to qj can be found as qi (cid:123) qjn⋆
where

n∈[−W ,W ]
The entire path of peaks can then be easily identified by tracing
back the previous steps from qjn⋆ until the starting point ti. Fig. 8b
depicts an example of the peak tracking results for a back-and-forth
movement consisting of two periods of alignment.
In principle, the above peak tracking should be performed on ev-
ery pair. Two steps, however, are taken to optimize the complexity:

(See §4.3); (2) In our implementation with 6-element array, we fa-
cilitate it by averaging the alignment matrix of parallel isometric
antenna pairs (e.g., antenna pairs (1, 4) and (3, 6), (2, 4) and (3, 5) as
in Fig. 2) and conduct peak tracking on the averaged matrix, which
is augmented since the two pairs have the same alignment delays.
4.3 Detecting Aligned Pairs
For the sake of robustness, we detect aligned antenna pairs in two
steps, a pre-check before peak tracking, and a post-check after that.
Pre-detection: In practice, we perform a pre-detection operation
to preclude the unaligned pairs before peak tracking. In particular,
for a specific period, we consider only antenna pairs that experience
prominent peaks most of the time as prospective candidates and
exclude the others that are unlikely aligned. The peak tracking is
then only employed on the selected candidate pairs.
Post-detection: After peak tracking, we obtain a path of identified
peaks for each antenna pair. We then further examine the extracted
paths, accounting for the continuity, TRRS values, smoothness, and
orientations they indicate, to ultimately confirm the most likely
aligned pairs.
4.4 Putting It All Together
Suppose the ith and jth antennas are detected to be aligned at time
t, with a separation distance of ∆dij and an alignment delay of
∆lij(t). Then we can measure the following results:
(1) Moving distance: The moving speed v(t) at time t is derived
as v(t) = ∆dij/∆lij(t). The moving distance can then be simply
derived by integrating the instantaneous speed over time, i.e., d(t) =
0 v(τ)d τ. Here we approximate v(t) to be constant during the
period of ∆lij(t), which is reasonable since ∆lij(t) is very short, e.g.,
 1, 000 m2, as shown in Fig. 10. To demonstrate RIM’s ad-
vantages in through-the-walls measurements, we by default place
the AP at the farthest location #0, a corner of the floor. We conduct
motion measurements at different locations over the floorplan (ex-
cept for some areas where we do not have access), covering areas
both near to, and far away (as far as 40 meters) from the AP. During
the experiments, the AP keeps broadcasting packets at 200Hz on a
40MHz channel in the 5GHz band.
To obtain ground truth, we set up a camera-based tracking sys-
tem. Specifically, the target is marked with high contrast color
and tracked by the cameras. The motion trace is first calculated
in the pixel frames and then converted to 2D world coordinates.
The outputs are synchronized with RIM’s estimates by the initial
point when the target starts moving and are pairwise compared
subsequently. There might be slight time offsets, which do not favor
our evaluation.
6.2 Micro Benchmarks
We now evaluate the overall performance in estimating moving
distance, heading direction, and rotating angle, and study how
various factors impact accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, the device
is moving at a speed of about 1 m/s, and the lengths of traces for
analysis all exceed 10 meters.
6.2.1 Accuracy of moving distance. To fully understand RIM’s
centimeter accuracy in moving distance estimation, we use a 3-
antenna linear array present in COTS WiFi and move it roughly
along lines in two scenarios: 1) Desktop: we move the array on
a desk surface for traces around 1 m; 2) Cart: we put the array
on a cart and push it straight forward by more than 10 meters in
