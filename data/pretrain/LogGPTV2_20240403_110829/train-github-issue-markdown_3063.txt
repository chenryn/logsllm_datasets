### Describe the workflow you want to enable
It is not a new algorithm, I was just frustrated running Grid and Random
SearchCV for hours without knowing when it ends. It should be easy to add a
print statement to inform the user about the process. It could be a percentage
(let's say 80% done), or just to inform which parameters have been used in
each iteration, so the user knows it is working.
### Describe your proposed solution
Either print parameters in each iteration  
or  
calculate how many iteration there are, and print the percentage done so far.
