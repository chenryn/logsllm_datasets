User: How to ensure cloud data security when using cloud computing platform?
Assistant: 1. Strengthen identity authentication and access control: Use strong passwords, two-factor authentication, etc. to limit access rights and ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data. 2. Strengthen data encryption protection: protect the confidentiality and integrity of data by encrypting data, and ensure the security of data on the cloud during transmission and storage. 3. Adopt appropriate security measures such as firewall, intrusion detection and anti-denial of service (DDoS) to ensure the network security of the cloud computing platform. 4. Regularly back up and restore the system: copy data to the backup storage device in real time, and establish a backup plan to ensure data recoverability. Deal with vulnerabilities in the cloud computing platform in a timely manner and update security patches. 5. Security audit and monitoring: Real-time monitoring of cloud computing platform security, audit and investigation of suspicious activities, timely discovery and response to security threats.
