I am developing an IRC bot in Python and would like to create standalone binaries for both Linux and Windows. Additionally, I want the console window to be hidden when the bot starts, so that the user cannot see it. How can I achieve this?

**Solution:**

**For Unix-based Systems (including GNU/Linux, macOS, and BSD):**
- You can use the `nohup` command to run your Python script in the background and prevent it from being terminated when you close the terminal. The syntax is:
  ```sh
  nohup python3 myscript.py &
  ```
  This will allow the script to continue running even if you close the terminal or log out of the session.

  If you are running the script on a cloud server and do not want to leave a hanging shell process, you can also run:
  ```sh
  nohup python3 myscript.py &
  exit
  ```

**For Windows Systems:**
- To hide the console window, you can save your Python script with a `.pyw` extension instead of `.py`. This will cause the script to be executed by `pythonw.exe`, which does not open a console window.
  
  For example, if your script is named `foo.py`, rename it to `foo.pyw`.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your IRC bot runs as a background process without displaying a console window on both Linux and Windows systems.
