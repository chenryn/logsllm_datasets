User: I am writing an IRC bot in Python. 
I wish to make stand-alone binaries for Linux and Windows of it. And mainly I wish that when the bot initiates, the console window should hide and the user should not be able to see the window.
What can I do for that?
Assistant: On Unix Systems (including GNU/Linux, macOS, and BSD)
Use nohup mypythonprog &, and you can close the terminal window without disrupting the process. You can also run exit if you are running in the cloud and don't want to leave a hanging shell process.
On Windows Systems
Save the program with a .pyw extension and now it will open with pythonw.exe. No shell window.
For example, if you have foo.py, you need to rename it to foo.pyw.
