User: Due to the sharp increase in visits, the load of a group of servers you manage has increased significantly. Please implement an automatic expansion plan.
Assistant: The automated capacity expansion solution includes the following steps: 1. Monitor server load: Use monitoring tools to regularly check server load conditions, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. 2. Establish thresholds: Set thresholds for server load. When the load exceeds the threshold, automatic expansion is started. 3. Automatic expansion: When the server load exceeds the threshold, the automatic expansion plan includes: - Starting a new server: According to the need, start a new server instance to share the load. - Synchronize data: transfer the data that needs to be synchronized to the new server. - Update the load balancing configuration: add new servers to the load balancer, so that requests are automatically assigned to the new servers. 4. Test the new server: Run automated tests on the new server to ensure that the server can work normally, and ensure that the server can automatically receive and process traffic through health checks and other methods. 5. Monitor new servers: Start monitoring the load on new servers and set new thresholds. If the load exceeds the threshold again, autoscaling can be initiated again. 6. Add the newly expanded server to the monitoring system: ensure that we can visualize the indicators of the newly expanded server, such as cAdvisor or white box monitoring system. Through the above automatic expansion scheme, it can ensure that the system can quickly respond to the growing traffic, so that users can always get a good service experience.
