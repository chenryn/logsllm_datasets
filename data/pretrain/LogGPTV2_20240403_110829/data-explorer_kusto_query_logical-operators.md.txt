# Logical (binary) operators
The following logical operators can be used to perform comparisons and evaluations:
|Operator name|Syntax|Meaning|
|-------------|------|-------|
|Equality     |`==`  |Returns `true` if both operands are non-null and equal to each other. Otherwise, returns `false`.|
|Inequality   |`!=`  |Returns `true` if any of the operands are null or if the operands aren't equal to each other. Otherwise, returns `false`.|
|Logical and  |`and` |Returns `true` only if both operands are `true`.|
|Logical or   |`or`  |Returns `true` if either of the operands is `true`, regardless of the other operand.|
> [!NOTE]
> These logical operators are sometimes referred-to as Boolean operators,
> and sometimes as binary operators. The terms are interchangeable.
## How logical operators work with null values
Null values adhere to the following rules:
| Operation | Result |
|--|--|
| `bool(null) == bool(null)` | `false` |
| `bool(null) != bool(null)` | `false` |
| `bool(null) and true` | `false` |
| `bool(null) or true` | `true` |
## Examples
### Equality
The following query returns a count of all storm events where the event type is "Tornado".
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
StormEvents
| where EventType == "Tornado"
| count
```
**Output**
|Count|
|--|
|1238|
### Inequality
The following query returns a count of all storm events where the event type isn't "Tornado".
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
StormEvents
| where EventType != "Tornado"
| count
```
**Output**
|Count|
|--|
|57828|
### Logical and
The following query returns a count of all storm events where the event type is "Tornado" and the state is "KANSAS".
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
StormEvents
| where EventType == "Tornado" and State == "KANSAS"
| count
```
**Output**
|Count|
|--|
|161|
### Logical or
The following query returns a count of all storm events where the event type is "Tornado" or "Thunderstorm Wind".
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
StormEvents
| where EventType == "Tornado" or EventType != "Thunderstorm Wind"
| count
```
**Output**
|Count|
|--|
|14253|
## Null values
The following query shows that null values are treated as false.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
print iff(bool(null) and true, true, false)
```
**Output**
|print_0|
|--|
|false|
