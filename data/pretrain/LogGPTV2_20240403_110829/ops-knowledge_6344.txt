User: I have a program that create files in a specific directory.
When those files are ready, I run Latex to produce a .pdf file.
So, my question is, how can I use this directory change as a trigger
to call Latex, using a shell script or a python script?
Best Regards
Assistant: Not much of a python man myself. But in a pinch, assuming you're on linux, you could periodically shell out and "ls -lrt /path/to/directory" (get the directory contents and sort by last modified), and compare the results of the last two calls for a difference. If so, then there was a change. Not very detailed, but gets the job done.
