### Chapter 1: Ethernet OAM and Connectivity Fault Management for Routers

#### Introduction to OAM Connectivity Fault Management (CFM)
- **Summary**: This section describes the Operation, Administration, and Management (OAM) of connectivity fault management (CFM).
- **IEEE 802.1ag OAM Connectivity Fault Management**: This topic emphasizes the use of CFM in a Metro Ethernet environment.

#### Key Features of CFM
- **Fault Monitoring**: Uses the continuity check protocol to serve as a neighbor discovery and health check protocol, identifying and maintaining adjacencies at the VLAN or link level.
- **Path Discovery and Fault Verification**: Uses the linktrace protocol to map the path taken to a destination MAC address through one or more bridged networks between the source and destination.
- **Fault Isolation**: Uses the loopback protocol, similar to IP ping, to work with the continuity check protocol during troubleshooting.

#### Administrative Domains
- CFM divides the service network into different administrative domains, such as operators, providers, and customers.
- Each administrative domain is linked with a maintenance domain that contains sufficient information for self-management, end-to-end monitoring, and security.
- Maintenance domains are associated with a maintenance domain level ranging from 0 to 7, with outermost domains allocated higher levels.

#### Maintenance Association
- Each service instance in a CFM maintenance domain is called a maintenance association.
- A maintenance association consists of a full mesh of maintenance endpoints (MEPs) that share similar characteristics.
- MEPs are active CFM entities that generate and respond to CFM protocol messages.
- Maintenance intermediate points (MIPs) are passive CFM entities that only respond to CFM messages.

#### Levels and Configurations
- MEPs can be up MEPs or down MEPs.
- In a Metro Ethernet network, CFM is commonly used by service providers to check connectivity among provider edge (PE) routers and by customers to check connectivity among customer edge (CE) routers.
- The configured customer CFM level must be greater than the service provider CFM level.

#### Support and Limitations
- CFM support on specific router models includes limitations such as restrictions on configuring up MEP and down MEP at the same level on an interface.
- CFM packets take the default queue and do not support forwarding class to queue (fc-to-queue) mapping in certain instances.
- CFM packets that are host-bound and host-generated do not bypass the configured firewall filters for both ingress and egress directions.

#### IEEE 802.1ag OAM Connectivity Fault Management
- **Support**: Junos OS supports IEEE 802.1ag connectivity fault management on specific router models.
- **Aggregated Ethernet Interfaces**: CFM sessions operate in distributed mode on the Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) on aggregated Ethernet interfaces, supporting graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES).

#### Best Practices for Configuring 802.1ag Ethernet OAM for VPLS
- **VLAN Normalization**: Required to switch packets correctly among logical interfaces in a VPLS routing instance.
- **Packet Forwarding Path**: Considerations for packet receive and transmit paths, including implicit interface filters and hardware-based forwarding.

#### Configuration
- **Create a Maintenance Domain**: Configure the name and level of the maintenance domain.
- **Create a Maintenance Association**: Include the maintenance-association statement and specify the short name format.
- **Configure Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIPs)**: Use the bridge-domain, instance, virtual-switch, and mip-half-function MIP options to specify the MIP configuration.

#### ACX Series Routers
- **MIP Configuration**: ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers support MIPs for the Ethernet OAM 802.1ag CFM protocol.
- **Limitations**: MIP configuration on VPLS services is not supported on ACX5048 and ACX5096 routers, and MIP is not supported on ACX5448 routers.
