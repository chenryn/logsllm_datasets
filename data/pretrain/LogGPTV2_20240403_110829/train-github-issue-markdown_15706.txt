**Current Behavior**
When using multiple `<ng-content>` selectors, only the last one is rendered.

**Expected/Desired Behavior**
All `<ng-content>` selectors should render their content if the conditions are met.

**Steps to Reproduce the Problem**
- Please refer to the following Stack Overflow question for a detailed example:
  - [Angular2 RC4: Multiple <ng-content> not working as expected](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38768324/angular2-rc-4-ng-content-duplicated-dont-work)

**Example Code**
```html
<my-component>
  <div *ngIf="condition1">
    {{title}}
  </div>
  <div *ngIf="condition2">
    {{subtitle}}
  </div>
</my-component>
```

**Expected Behavior**
Both `{{title}}` and `{{subtitle}}` should be rendered in their respective containers if the conditions are met.

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
The ability to conditionally render content in different containers within a component is essential for creating flexible and dynamic user interfaces.

**Environment Details**
- **Angular Version:** 2.0.0-rc.4
- **Browser:** All
- **Language:** TypeScript
