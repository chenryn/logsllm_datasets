### GTVHacker: Exploits and Rooting Methods

#### CubeRoot
- **Functionality**: Also patches the exploit to prevent malicious applications.
- **Availability**: Initially available on the Google Play Store for 6 days, it was later removed. It can now be downloaded from [GTVHacker.com](http://DC21.GTVHacker.com).
- **Statistics**:
  - Downloaded by a significant number of users.
  - Rooted multiple devices, including one engineering build.
- **Patching**: The exploit was patched at the beginning of July, approximately two months after its release.

#### One Root to Rule Them All
- **Details**: For more information, visit [GTVHacker.com](http://DC21.GTVHacker.com).

#### Magic USB
- **Background**: Recall our previous exploits involving file system nodes and block devices. In the first generation of Google TV devices, we used a USB device that was improperly not mounted as "nodev" to gain access. This method was limited to only two very similar devices.
- **Scope**: The new Magic USB exploit affects all Google TV devices and some other Android devices, as well as certain specific Linux boxes.
- **Vulnerability**: The volume daemon (vold) mounts NTFS partitions without the "nodev" flag, allowing the creation of Linux block and character devices.
- **Exploit Steps**:
  - Use an NTFS drive with a block device to read/write on any box and any partition.
  - Achieve root access on every single box by:
    - Dumping `boot.img`.
    - Patching `init.rc` or `default.prop` to set `ro.secure=0`.
    - Writing the modified image back (as a user, no root needed).
    - Rebooting to gain root access.
  - Note: Sony boxes require an additional step.

#### Hardware Mods and Exploits
- **Sony NSZ-GS7 with EMMC->SD and SATA Mods**
  - **Dual Core ARM L9 (aka LG1152)**: Everything is signed, even the splash screen.
  - **Challenges**: Known as our "White Whale," this device is difficult to modify due to its security features.
  - **Hardware Root**: EMMC Flash, MMC, SD, and SPI mode fallbacks.
  - **LG 47/55G2 Root**:
    - **Partinfo Location**: At `0x100000`. To find the location, count back 6 bytes and byte-swap.
    - **Mount System Partition**:
      ```bash
      mount -text4 -o,skip=122159104 /dev/sdXX /mnt/system
      ```
    - **Root FS**: A signed squashfs image. Modify the init script to spawn a telnet or root shell over UART or PL2303 USB serial adapter.
    - **Debug Agent**: Requires a dongle and runs over UART.

- **Sony NSZ-GS7/GS8**:
  - **EMMC Flash**: Boot and system are not signed, making it easier to interface.
  - **Root Access**: Rewrite `/boot` or `/system` to remove RSA signed init script checks and bypass kernel restrictions.
  - **SATA HDD**: Add a SATA connector and connect a hard drive, but note that there is no kernel support for SATA.

#### Marvell Armada 1500 Secure Boot Exploit
- **Affected Devices**:
  - Sony NSZ-GS7
  - Netgear NeoTV Prime
  - Vizio Co-Star
  - Hisense Pulse
  - Asus CUBE
  - Sony NSZ-GS8
  - LG U+ IPTV
  - Google “Berlin”
  - ZeroDesktop MiiPC
  - Hisense XT780 TV
  - Lenovo S31/S61 TV
  - TCL MoVo
  - And others

- **Security Overview**:
  - **Bootloader Messages**: Detailed overview available at [GTVHacker.com](http://DC21.GTVHacker.com).
  - **Android Kernel + Marvell Secure Image**: Allows modification of the ramdisk load address to run unsigned code.
  - **Exploit Process**:
    - **Sony NSZ-GS7**: Append a tiny secure image to validate the normal signed kernel.
    - **Custom Recovery + Kernel**: Change the ramdisk size to match the new "ramdisk" and set the ramdisk load address to `0x1008000 - Size of Signed Kernel`.

#### Future Research
- **Unsigned Kernels on Gen 1 (Revue) w/ NTFS Exploit**: Further work is needed in this area.
