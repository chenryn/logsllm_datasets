# Factors Affecting Continued Efforts

Several factors will determine the impact on your ongoing efforts:

- **Installed Software**: Consider whether the system in question involves installed software.
- **Black Box Technology**: Determine if it is a black-box technology, which may limit your ability to understand its inner workings.
- **System Control**: Assess whether you have control over the system or if it is managed by an external entity.

# Analyzing These Systems

### Key Points to Consider

- **Understanding the Puzzle**: It is not necessary to know every detail, but a basic understanding of your devices and software is crucial.
- **System Interfaces**: Identify the interfaces through which these systems interact with you. Even a single interface can create a potential attack surface.

# Installed Software

### Documentation and Purpose

- **Read EULA and Documentation**: Familiarize yourself with the End User License Agreement (EULA) and associated documentation.
- **Software Purpose**: Understand the intended purpose of the software and compare it with its actual behavior on your system.

### Concerns and Analysis

- **File Access**: Monitor which files and parts of the computer the software accesses. Evaluate whether this access is expected and functional.
- **Third-Party Communication**: Check if the software is sending data to third parties. Use tools like Wireshark or TCPdump to analyze network communications.

### Tools for Analysis

- **Network Monitoring**: Utilize tools such as Wireshark and TCPdump to monitor network traffic.
- **File Access Monitoring**: Use tools like `lsof` and `filemon` to track file access.
- **Open Source Analysis**: If the software is open-source, review the code or seek out existing analyses.

### Research and Data Access

- **Web Research**: Look for known issues and vulnerabilities related to the software.
- **Data Access**: Be aware that installed software typically has access to all information on your computer.

# Black Box Analysis

### Understanding the Device

- **Documentation**: Read agreements and other relevant documentation.
- **Function and Medium**: Determine the device's function and the medium it uses for data transfer.
- **Interfaces**: Identify the available interfaces and the type of information the device can access.

### Observing Behavior

- **Visual and Audible Indicators**: Look for activity lights, hard drive activity, and other indicators.
- **Communication Monitoring**: Place a device on the medium to listen for communication.
- **Interface Manipulation**: Explore if other interfaces can be manipulated.

### Example: Cable Box with DVR

- **Access to Data**: The cable box has access to real-time and recorded television and movie data, as well as your viewing schedule.
- **Transfer Medium**: Data is transferred over coaxial cable.
- **Interfaces**: Infrared, USB, serial, multiple coax inputs, and video inputs.

# Systems Out of Your Control

### Limited Surface Area

- **Documentation and Warnings**: Read all agreements, documentation, and warnings.
- **Identify Interfaces**: Determine the interfaces and the data the system can access.
- **Lowered Attack Surface**: You will likely have a limited surface area to work with.

### Example: Surveillance System

- **Information Collected**: Identification and location information.
- **Transfer Medium**: Wireless or Ethernet.
- **Interfaces**: Video camera (likely the only accessible interface).

# Attacking Systems

### Goals of Attacks

- **Integrity and Availability**: Attacks aim to affect the integrity and availability of the system.
- **Confidentiality**: Sometimes, attacks target the confidentiality of the data.
- **System Trustworthiness**: Making the system's data untrustworthy can render the system ineffective.

### Impact of Unreliable Systems

- **Unreliable Data**: Bad data leads to bad decisions, resulting in unreliable systems.
- **Example**: If banks frequently lost money, customers would stop using them.

# A New Classification Scheme for Attacks

### Three Levels of Attacks

- **Level 1 Attack**: Affects the input device's ability to perform its function.
- **Level 2 Attack**: Affects the accuracy of stored data.
- **Level 3 Attack**: Affects the processing decisions of the system.

### Examples

- **Level 1**: Destruction or disabling of the input device.
- **Level 2**: Injecting bad or massive amounts of data.
- **Level 3**: Falsely triggering or bypassing system events.

# Practical Examples

### Simple Security Camera

- **Input Device Attack**: Destroy or blind the camera.
- **Data Storage Attack**: Introduce irrelevant data, such as dressing up in a costume.

### Intelligent Security Camera

- **Input Device Attack**: Destroy or blind the camera.
- **Event Triggering**: Falsely trigger or bypass events based on behavior.

### RFID Passport

- **Device Failure**: One out of every five passports fails to read.
- **Data Corruption**: One out of every twenty passports contains incorrect information.

### Stealth Retina Scanning

- **Avoidance**: Wear sunglasses or avoid the store altogether.

# What Can You Do?

### Protecting Your Privacy

- **Avoid Data-Collecting Systems**: Minimize the use of systems that collect data about you.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt communications and verify the identity of the entities you communicate with.
- **Analyze and Filter**: Regularly analyze your systems and filter unwanted traffic.
- **Consumer Action**: Contact companies and demand changes or refuse to use their services.

### Additional Tips

- **Discount Cards**: Use new discount cards or use them selectively.
- **Credit Card Usage**: Minimize credit card use.
- **Encryption**: Use encryption for instant messaging and email.
- **New Technologies**: View new technologies with caution until they are verified.
