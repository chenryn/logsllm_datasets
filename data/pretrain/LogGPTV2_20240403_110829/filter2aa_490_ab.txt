from these systems.
● Items that will affect your continued efforts will
be determined by a couple of factors:
– Is this installed software?
– Is this black box technology?
– System out of your control?

Analyzing These Systems
● It is not necessary to know all the pieces of the
puzzle.
● Know your devices and software.
● What do you have to work with?
– These systems are going to have to have interface
with you.
– It may only take one interface to make an attack
surface.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Installed Software
● Read EULA and associated documentation.
● Remember, this is installed on your system.
● What does the software do (its intended
purpose)?
– Inventory these purposes.
– Now what is it doing on your machine?
● Compare the purpose with the actions it is taking on your
system.
The Hacker Pimps

Installed Software
● Concerns
– What files / parts of the computer is it accessing?
● Why? Is it a function of that application?
– Did it scatter pieces of itself all over
– Is it sending information to a 3rd party?
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Installed Software
● Use tools at your disposal to analyze behavior
of software. Remember, you have full access to
the system.
● Communications
– If software is spying on you it is going to send the
data somewhere.
– Where is it sending data?
– What protocol is it using?
– What is the format of the data?
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Installed Software
● File Access
– What files does the software access?
– Is it expected to access those files?
● Tools to use
– Network (Wireshark, TCPdump, etc.)
– File Access (lsof, filemon, etc.)
● Is the software open source?
– Look at the code or find someone with an analysis
that did.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Installed Software
● Research the web for known issues.
● Keep in mind the installed software most likely
has access to all of the information on your
computer.

Black Box Analysis
● Read agreements and other documentation.
● Know the device.
– What is the function of the device?
– What medium does it use to transfer data?
– What interfaces does it have?
● What type of information does the black box
have access to?
– Remember it doesn't have to be Credit Card data to
be important.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Black Box Analysis
● Is there a way visually or audibly observe
behavior?
– Activity lights, Hard drive activity, etc.
– Are there times when this activity can be observed
being heavier than usual while certain functions are
being performed?
● Can you put a device on the medium to listen
for communication?
● Does it have other interfaces that can be
messed with?
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Black Box Example
● A Cable Box with a built in DVR
● Information
– Has access to television and movie data you watch.
● Real-time and recorded.
– Your schedule.
● Would know when you are home and when you are
away.
● Medium to transfer data.
– Transfers data over coaxial cable.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Black Box Example
● Has multiple interfaces.
– Infrared.
– USB
– Serial
– Multiple Coax inputs
– Multiple misc video inputs
● Visual and Audible
– Hard drive
– Lights

Systems Out Of Your Control
● Read agreements, documentation, warnings,
etc.
● Most likely you are going to have a severely
lowered surface to work with.
● Identify Interfaces.
● Identify data the system has access to.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Systems Example
● Surveillance system with /detection
● Information Collected
– Identification Information
– Location Information
● Transfer medium
– Wireless?
– Ethernet?

Systems Example
● Interfaces
– Video Camera (Probably the only one you are going
to have access to)

Attacking Systems
● What is the goal of attacking these systems?
– Affect integrity
– Affect availability
– Sometimes confidentiality
● Basically making the system's data so it can't
be trusted.
● Simply, sometimes systems can be attacked by
just not using them.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
The Point of This
If a systems data can not be trusted or counted
upon, then the system will not be used or
rendered ineffective.
Bad data + Bad decisions = Unreliable Systems
If banks had the tendency to loose your money,
would you use them?

A New Way To Look Attacks
● A new classification scheme for attacks on
information gathering systems and other
systems that invade our privacy.
● This classification scheme can be broken down
in to three levels.
– Level 1 Attacks
– Level 2 Attacks
– Level 3 Attacks
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Level 1
● Level 1 Attack: Affects the ability of the input
device to perform its function.
● Examples:
– Destruction of input device.
– Disabling of the input device.
– Cause a malfunction under certain conditions.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Level 2
● Level 2 Attack: Affects the accuracy of the data
stored.
● Examples:
– Injecting bad data.
– Injecting massive amounts of data.
● May overflow the capacity of the storage media.
● Useless data.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
Level 3
● Level 3 Attack: Affects processing decisions of
the system.
● Examples:
– Falsely triggering events based on algorithms
(False Positives)
– Bypassing system by not triggering events (False
Negatives)

Nice!!!
● Cell phone monitoring anyone?
– “Hey, have you heard that new band assassination
plot, they're the bomb.”
● I have a friend who seems to have the uncanny
ability to work in words such bomb, nuclear, and
assassin in every phone conversation we have.

Examples
The best way to have a look at this is through
some examples. These are very simple examples,
many of the systems in the wild will be a lot more
complex.

So What Can You Do?
● Avoid using systems that collect data about
you.
● Encrypt communications and ensure you are
communicating with who you think you are.
● Analyze systems you have and filter unwanted
traffic.
● Contact companies and tell them you refuse to
use their services anymore, unless they
change.

So What Can You Do?
● Use a new discount card every time.
– Or only use discount card when it is really funny for
tampons and douches
– Interesting new trend in discount cards
● Minimize use of credit card.
● Leave as little data as possible behind.
● Use encryption when instant messaging.
● Use encryption for Email.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
So What Can You Do?
● Analyze new toys for potential issues.
– Possible backdoor accounts
– Possible hidden communication
● Beware of any technology that can track you or
put you in a given place at a certain time.
● Intrusive stores should be avoided.
The Hacker Pimps
The Hexagon Security Group
So What Can You Do?
● Remember, at first always view the next big
thing or the newest gadget as a threat.
– Move on when you have verified
