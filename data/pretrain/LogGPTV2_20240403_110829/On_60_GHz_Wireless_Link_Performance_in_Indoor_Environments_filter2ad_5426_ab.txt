#### Traffic and Metrics
We generate backlogged traffic at 2 Gbps using simple transmit and receive modules that directly write to and read from `/dev/sgdma` in 32KB chunks of data in a loop for a specified duration. Each experiment runs for 20 seconds and is repeated four times. We remove data from the start and end of experiments to avoid edge effects. The performance metric used is link goodput, which is measured as the average number of correctly received bits per second. We account for both byte corruption (by sending a known sequence of bytes) and packet loss.

#### 5. Evaluation
In this section, we present several results that demonstrate the performance of 60 GHz radios in indoor environments, focusing on:
- Their ability to overcome wall/cubicle blockage.
- Sensitivity to node (or antenna array) orientation.
- Robustness to human-body blockage and walking-speed mobility (preliminary).

#### Effect of LOS/NLOS Node Location
For each of the eleven locations, Figure 3(a) shows the goodput when the nodes are aligned (i.e., Orientation Index #0) and across all X-Y orientations. When the nodes are aligned, goodput performance remains consistently around 2 Gbps, regardless of the LOS/NLOS nature of the location. This indicates that 60 GHz radios can overcome persistent blockage by walls and cubicles. While the mean goodput does drop when considering all orientations, it still exceeds 0.5 Gbps even in locations with persistent wall/cubicle blockage.

To investigate the high standard deviation in goodput across orientations, we plot the goodput for each orientation in two sample locations in Figure 3(b). A binary goodput behavior (i.e., either > 1 Gbps or zero) is revealed due to our use of a fixed PHY bit-rate. Overall, Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show that performance is highly sensitive to node orientation. We study this effect in detail next.

#### Goodput Analysis
- **Figure 5.** Goodput (a) per-orientation across locations and (b) per-location across heights and orientations.

- **Figure 6.** Complementary CDF of (a) per-second link goodput across locations when both, either, or neither side is aligned with the other, and (b) per-second link goodput when one side chooses from multiple fixed antenna arrays.

#### Sensitivity to Node or Antenna Array Orientation
In real-world deployments, the antenna array orientation on either TX/RX can be along any one of three dimensions. To account for this, we study the performance for different fixed orientations in the X-Y plane and the effect of relative height differences and orientations in the X-Z plane.

- **X-Y Plane:** Figure 5(a) shows the mean and standard deviation in goodput across all locations for each TX/RX orientation. The mean goodput of all orientations is above 0.5 Gbps, and 50% of the orientations have a goodput of above 1 Gbps.

- **X-Z Plane:** Further analysis of the X-Z plane is ongoing and will be presented in future work.

This comprehensive evaluation provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of 60 GHz wireless links in various indoor environments, highlighting their potential and limitations.
