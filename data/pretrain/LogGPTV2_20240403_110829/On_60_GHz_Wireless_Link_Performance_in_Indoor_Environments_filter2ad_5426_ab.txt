Traﬃc and Metrics: We generate backlogged traﬃc at 2 Gbps by using simple
transmit and receive modules that directly write to and read from /dev/sgdma
32KB chunks of data in a loop for a speciﬁed amount of time1. Each experiment
runs for 20 seconds and is repeated four times. We remove data from the start
and end of experiments to avoid edge eﬀects. We use link goodput as the metric
to quantify performance. Link goodput is measured as the average number of
correctly received bits-per-second. Note that we account for both byte corruption
(we send a known sequence of bytes) as well as loss.
5 Evaluation
In this section, we present several results that demonstrate in indoor environ-
ments: (a) the ability of 60 GHz radios to overcome wall/cubicle blockage, (b)
their sensitivity to node (or antenna array) orientation, and (c) their robustness
to human-body blockage and walking-speeds mobility (preliminary).

Eﬀect of LOS/NLOS Node Location: For each of the eleven locations,
Figure 3(a) shows the goodput when the nodes are aligned (i.e. Orientation

Idx. #0) and across all X-Y orientations. When the nodes are aligned, goodput
performance remains ∼2 Gbps consistently irrespective of the LOS/NLOS nature
of the location. Thus, contrary to conventional perception, 60 GHz radios are able
to overcome persistent blockage by walls and cubicles. While the mean goodput
does drop when we consider all orientations, it is still > 0.5Gbps even in locations
with persistent wall/cubicle blockage.
To investigate the high standard deviation in goodput across orientations, we
plot the goodput for each orientation in two sample locations in Figure 3(b). A
binary goodput behavior (i.e. either > 1Gbps or zero) is revealed due to our use
of a ﬁxed PHY bit-rate. Overall, Figures 3(a) and 3(b) reveal that performance
is very sensitive to node orientation. We study this eﬀect in detail next.

Sensitivity to Node or Antenna Array Orientation: In real-world deploy-
ments, antenna array orientation on either TX/RX can be along any one of
three dimensions. To account for this, we study the performance for diﬀerent
ﬁxed orientations in the X-Y plane. We also consider the eﬀect of relative height
diﬀerences and orientations in the X-Z plane.
X-Y plane: Figure 5(a) shows for each TX/RX orientation, the mean and
standard deviation in goodput across all locations. Mean goodput of all orien-
tations is above 0.5 Gbps and 50% of the orientations have a goodput of above
