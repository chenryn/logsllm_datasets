Question: A web application developer is working on enhancing the security of user session management. The application strictly requires cookies to be accessed only via HTTPS, have a limited lifespan, not be accessible from JavaScript, and restrict cross-origin requests to protect against CSRF attacks. Which of the following sets of cookie attributes would best meet these requirements?
"A": "Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT",
"B": "Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/; Domain=example.com",
"C": "Set-Cookie: __Host-sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=3600",
"D": "Set-Cookie: __Secure-sessionId=abc123; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Max-Age=3600"
