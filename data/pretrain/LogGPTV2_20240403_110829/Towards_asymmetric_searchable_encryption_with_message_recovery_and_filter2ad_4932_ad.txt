As a result, the equalities associated with labels (3),
(4), and (5) in the deﬁnition of Test2 hold, we can
conclude that Test2(c, w, t∗,s, SKs) = 1.

The second equality implies that w∗ = w. Based on
this fact, it is straightforward to verify that the ﬁrst
equality implies w† = 1. Based on the proof of the
ﬁrst requirement, it is clear that Decrypt(c, SKr) = w
holds.

In this game, let the attacker’s advantage be ǫ2. Given
that H2 is modeled as a random oracle, this game is identical
to Game1 so that ǫ2 = ǫ1.
Next, consider a game Game3, where the challenger per-
forms in the same way as in Game2, except that the chal-
lenge cwb = (c1, c2, c3, c4, c5) is generated as follows.

In Game3, let the attacker’s advantage be ǫ3.
If H1 and
H3 are modeled as random oracles, then Game3 diﬀers from
Game2 only if ˆe(gx1
1 , H2(wb)r1 ) has been queried to H1 or
∗||ˆe(gx1
1 , H2(w)r1 )||∗ has been queried to H3 where the *
can be anything. Based on the Diﬀerence lemma [11] and
CLAIM 1 (stated and proven below), |ǫ3 − ǫ2| is negligible
based on the BDH assumption.
Next, consider a new game Game4, where the challenger
performs in the same way as in Game3, except that the
challenge cwb = (c1, c2, c3, c4, c5) is generated as follows.
r1, r2 ∈R Zp, R ∈R G2, R′ ∈R {0, 1}λ, c1 = gr1

Clearly, Game4 is identical to Game3. Let the attacker’s
advantage be ǫ4, so that we have ǫ4 = ǫ3. Based on its
deﬁnition, ǫ4 can also be regarded as the attacker’s advan-
tage in distinguishing X0 and X1, where x1, x2, y∗, r1, r2 ∈R
Zp. Other public parameters (e.g. pairing parameters and
w0, w1) are described in the game.

duction is based on the fact that it is straightforward to
construct a D5’s instance from W0 and W1.

Based on all above reductions, in Game4, the attacker’s
advantage ǫ4 is negligible based on the DLIN assumption.
As a result, ǫ0 is negligible based on all the assumptions
mentioned in the theorem.
Claim 1. In Game3 of the proof of Theorem 2, the at-
1 , H2(wb)r1 )
tacker can only succeed in querying H1 with ˆe(gx1
for a negligible probability based on the BDH assumption.
Reduction step 2a. D1 is equivalent to distinguish Y0 and
is
Y1, where x2, r1, r2 ∈R Zp and h1 ∈R G. Note that gx1·y∗

Proof.
In Game3, besides the public parameters, the
challenger only needs (gx1·y∗
) in order to answer
the attacker’s oracle queries. The computational problem
(referred to as P1) is deﬁned as follows.

• Input: (g1, g2, gx1·y∗

public parameters are described in the game.

The problem P1 can be equivalently rephrased as follows,
is set to be h1 and H2(wb)
referred to as P2. Note that gx1·y∗
is set to be h2.

• Input: (g1, g2, h1, h2, gx1

• Output: ˆe(gx1

).
The problem P2 can be reduced to the following problem
(referred to as P3).
• Input: (g1, g2, gx1

2 ), where x1, x2, r1, r2 ∈R
Zp.
• Output: ˆe(gx1

).
The reduction is based on the fact that, from a P3’s in-
2 ), we can construct a P2’s in-
2 , (gx2
stance (g1, g2, gx1
stance (g1, g2, gα
