User: How to check the load status of the system in Linux? How to optimize the system load through the command line?
Assistant: 1. View the system load: Use the uptime command to view the system load. The results returned by this command include the current system time, system running time, number of currently logged-in users, and average system load. The three numbers after the average load are the average load within 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes respectively. If these numbers exceed the number of CPU cores or CPU processing power, it means that the system is overloaded. 2. System load optimization: a. Optimize CPU utilization: Use the top command to view the processes that occupy the most CPU resources in the system, find out which processes occupy more CPU resources, and then adjust them to reduce the CPU load. b. Optimize disk I/O: Use the iotop command to view the processes with the most active disk I/O in the system, find out which processes occupy more disk I/O, and adjust them accordingly. c. Optimize memory utilization: Use the free command to view the amount of free memory in the system. If the memory usage is high, you can optimize memory by stopping unnecessary processes or enabling the Swap partition. d. Optimize network traffic: Use the netstat command to view the network connection status in the system, find out which processes occupy more network traffic, and adjust them to reduce the occupation of network traffic.
