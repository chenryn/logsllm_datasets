User: When deploying new applications, how can grayscale releases be performed to minimize risk?
Assistant: Canary rollout is a method of gradually deploying a new application into production to minimize risk. The following are the steps for grayscale release: 1. Clearly define the release process, including steps such as testing, pre-release, restricted access, release and inspection. 2. Phased rollout: roll out the new application to a small subset of users, say 10% of users, and gradually increase to 25, 50, 75, 100%. 3. Release by group: Release new applications to some specific customer groups, such as customers who frequently use or highly depend on the application. Deploy the older version across these customer groups and use the monitoring system of the newer version to monitor performance compared to the older version. 4. Monitoring and rollback: Use a monitoring system to detect all critical parameters and be ready to roll back to the old version at any time to minimize risks. 5. Test new releases for reliability and stability, and handle potential bugs. The ultimate goal is to fully deploy the new application in production with as little risk as possible while ensuring the ability to roll back to older versions.
