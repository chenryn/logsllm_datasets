A USAGE AND PERCEPTIONS OF
BLOCKLISTS
In this section, we survey network operators to understand blocklist
usage to filter suspicious traffic. This is when users of reused ad-
dresses could be unjustly blocked. Further, we try to understand the
operator’s anecdotal experiences on blocklisting reused addresses.
This helps us to establish the importance of this issue from a human
perspective.
We circulated an online questionnaire to regional network op-
erator groups by posting to all groups that published open-access

faced issues with reused addresses in blocklists.
mailing lists (identified via [75]). We received responses from mem-
bers of forty groups. Network operators’ mailing lists are forums
for network engineers, operators, and other technical professionals
to coordinate and disseminate information about network security,
peering, routing, and other operational Internet issues. We chose
this strategy to maximize outreach to the relevant communities,
offering apologies in advance for potential overlap as operators may
subscribe to more than one list (e.g. NYNOG for New York, USA, in
addition to NANOG for North America). Mailing list subscribers
were informed that the purpose of the study was to better under-
stand current blocklisting practices and challenges. Participants
could complete the survey anonymously and were offered the op-
tion to subscribe to receive findings from the completed study. The
survey included 24 questions on what blocklists are used, the role
they play in filtering (e.g. indirect blocking or as an input to a threat
intelligence system), and their perceived benefits and limitations
(see Section C of Appendix). Between July and August 2019, 65
respondents finished and submitted survey answers. Survey partic-
ipants operate networks in five continents, including end-user and
enterprise ISPs and content providers. Sizes of networks vary from
100 to over 10 million users. Our survey did not require IRB, since
we did not collect any personal data and our results are not based
on human subjects. Our key findings are as follows:
Blocklists are widely used and are used for active defense:
Network operators use two types of blocklists – operator curated
internal blocklists and external blocklists that includes paid-for or
publicly available blocklists. About 70% of operators maintained
internal blocklists and 85% used external blocklists. Network op-
erators often use multiple blocklists to defend their networks. 55%
of respondents used two or more different types of blocklists. On
average, network operators subscribed to 2 paid-for lists and 10
publicly available blocklists and can use up to 39 paid-for and 68

public blocklists. Usage of blocklists can have consequences as net-
work operators often use them to block traffic. 59% of surveyed
network operators use blocklisted addresses to directly block traffic,
and fewer than 35% of network operators use blocklisted addresses
as an input to other threat intelligence systems. Therefore, depend-
ing on the blocklists used, network operators could unjustly block
users in reused addresses. Our survey also finds that some net-
work operators set manual filters to override blocklisting in address
spaces that they believed were dynamically allocated. We also find
that blocklists have usage beyond blocking. One of the surveyed
network operators checks its own addresses on blocklists before
assigning them to new customers, to avoid unjust blocking.
Perceived inaccuracies due to reused addresses: When asked
directly, only 34 of the survey respondents answered this question.
56% of the respondents (19 out of 34) believed carrier-grade NAT
(CGN) affected the accuracy of blocklists, citing cases where legiti-
mate users were getting blocked because of a shared address. About
76% of respondents (26 out of 34) said that dynamic addressing af-
fected the accuracy of blocklists. As a part of the survey, operators
identified the type of external blocklists used in their network. Fig-
ure 9 shows the type of blocklists used operators that have faced
issues with blocklists due to reused addresses. Among the block-
lists subscribed by these operators, we find spam and reputation
blocklists to have the highest consequences of blocking reused ad-
dresses. Although our findings are anecdotal, previous studies have
shown malicious activities such as spamming to be correlated with
dynamically allocated address spaces [76, 78].
B BLOCKLIST DATASET
A network operator could use its own set of blocklists to determine
reused addresses. We use 151 public blocklists taken from BLAG
dataset [60] as shown in Table 2. We collected blocklist data for
83 days over two measurement periods from 03 Aug 2019 to 10
Sep 2019 (39 days) and 29 Mar 2020 to 11 May 2020 (44 days). As a
part of the survey (Section A), some network operators manually
listed external blocklists used by them. There are 27 such blocklists
indicated by a * in Table 2.
