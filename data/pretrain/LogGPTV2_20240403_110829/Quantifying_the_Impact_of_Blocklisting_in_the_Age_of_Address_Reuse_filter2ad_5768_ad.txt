## Usage and Perceptions of Blocklists

In this section, we survey network operators to understand blocklist usage for filtering suspicious traffic, particularly focusing on the potential for unjust blocking of users with reused addresses. We also explore the operators' anecdotal experiences with blocklisting reused addresses to highlight the human impact of this issue.

We distributed an online questionnaire to regional network operator groups via open-access mailing lists, identified through [75]. Responses were received from members of forty groups. These mailing lists serve as forums for network engineers, operators, and other technical professionals to share information about network security, peering, routing, and other operational Internet issues. This approach was chosen to maximize outreach to relevant communities, with apologies for any overlap as some operators may subscribe to multiple lists.

The survey included 24 questions covering the types of blocklists used, their role in filtering (e.g., direct blocking or input to threat intelligence systems), and their perceived benefits and limitations (see Section C of the Appendix). Between July and August 2019, 65 respondents completed the survey. Participants operate networks across five continents, including end-user and enterprise ISPs and content providers, with network sizes ranging from 100 to over 10 million users. No IRB approval was required as no personal data was collected, and results are not based on human subjects.

### Key Findings

- **Widespread Use and Active Defense**: Network operators use two types of blocklists—internal and external. About 70% maintain internal blocklists, and 85% use external blocklists. Many operators use multiple blocklists, with 55% using two or more types. On average, they subscribe to 2 paid-for and 10 publicly available blocklists, with a maximum of 39 paid-for and 68 public blocklists. Blocklists are often used to directly block traffic, with 59% of operators doing so. Fewer than 35% use blocklisted addresses as inputs to threat intelligence systems. Some operators set manual filters to override blocklisting in dynamically allocated address spaces.
- **Perceived Inaccuracies Due to Reused Addresses**: Only 34 out of 65 respondents addressed this question. 56% (19 out of 34) believed carrier-grade NAT (CGN) affected blocklist accuracy, citing cases where legitimate users were blocked due to shared addresses. 76% (26 out of 34) said dynamic addressing affected blocklist accuracy. Figure 9 shows the types of blocklists used by operators who have faced issues with reused addresses. Spam and reputation blocklists had the highest consequences for blocking reused addresses.

## Blocklist Dataset

To determine reused addresses, we used 151 public blocklists from the BLAG dataset [60] (Table 2). Data was collected over two periods: from August 3, 2019, to September 10, 2019 (39 days), and from March 29, 2020, to May 11, 2020 (44 days). Some operators manually listed external blocklists, indicated by an asterisk (*) in Table 2.

## Questionnaire on Perceptions of Blocklists

Questions permitting open-ended responses are denoted with asterisks:
