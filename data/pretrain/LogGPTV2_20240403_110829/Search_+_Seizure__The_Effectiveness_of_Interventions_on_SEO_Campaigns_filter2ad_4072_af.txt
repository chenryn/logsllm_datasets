representing 17 brand holders GBC seized 31K domains using 69
court orders from December 2012 to June 2014. Similarly, while
representing 11 brand holders SMGPA seized 8K domains using 47
court orders from February 2012 to July 2014.
Seizing domains can disrupt online counterfeit stores. For ex-
ample, Figure 6 shows order numbers over time for four stores pro-
moted by the PHP?P= campaign. The domain for its Abercrombie
UK store was seized on February 9, 2014 (vertical dotted line), and
its rate of new order numbers declined immediately (it did not stop
completely due to reaction by the SEO campaign, as discussed be-
low in Section 5.3.2).
Despite their aggressiveness, though, brand holders must be far
more aggressive when seizing domains. From the PSRs crawled,
we directly observed 290 seizures over our eight-month period:
214 seized by GBC and 76 by SMGPA. Compared with the total
number of storefronts we observed (7,484), though, these domain
seizures represent just a small percentage (3.9%) of stores used by
6Another option would be to seize doorway domains, but doing
so presents two obstacles: there are two orders of magnitude more
doorway domains than stores (Table 2), and the doorways are often
compromised sites.

PHP?P= campaign. Each curve corresponds to one of four inter-
national stores, where three sell Abercrombie (United Kingdom,
Germany) while the remaining sells Woolrich (Italy).
SEO campaigns. As a result, unless brands comprehensively seize
domains, stores promoted by SEO campaigns remain unaffected
and they continue to attract trafﬁc and customers via search. Refer-
ring back to the example in Figure 6, the orders remained steady at
other stores whose domains were not seized and the SEO campaign
remained effective overall.
5.3.2 Reaction Time
Even if brands eventually seize all storefront domains, though,
they take such a long time to seize domains, and attackers respond
so quickly to having domains seized, that the current environment
still strongly favors the attackers.
As with labeling sites as “hacked”, the time from when a store-
front goes live and when a brand seizes the store domain represents
the window of opportunity for a counterfeit store to monetize traf-
ﬁc. As in Section 5.2.2, we can compute the lifetime of seized
stores to measure their earning potential before seizure. We deﬁne
the lifetime of seized stores as the delta between the ﬁrst time that
the storefront appears in PSRs to the time the domain was seized.
We ﬁnd the average lifetime of seized stores lies between 58–68
days for GBC and 48–56 days for SMGPA. Again, due to the nature
of our data collection, we can only observe seizures when crawling
search results redirects our crawlers to seized stores. Therefore,
we cannot determine exactly when a seizure takes place. Instead,
we present two bounded numbers approximating the true lifetime.
The smaller is the duration ending when we last saw the store ac-
tively poisoning search results, while the larger is the lifetime end-
ing when we ﬁrst deﬁnitively observed the seizure.7
However, even when brands seize storefront domains, the SEO
campaigns possess backup domains in anticipation of such an inter-
vention and can quickly react to continue to monetize trafﬁc with-
out signiﬁcant interruption. Returning to the example in Figure 6,
when the Abercrombie UK domain was seized, the PHP?P= cam-
paign changed their doorways to forward to a new store domain
within 24 hours. This domain agility represents a critical weakness
of seizures: even though a store domain is seized, SEO campaigns
7Given how quickly campaigns react to domain seizures, it is also
possible for campaigns to redirect doorways to new store domains
faster than our crawler can detect that the initial domain was seized.

rather than the seized domains.
Indeed, we found widespread evidence of attackers exploiting
this weakness as a countermeasure to domain seizures. Speciﬁcally,
of the 214 seized stores from GBC, 130 were redirected to new
stores (59 of which were subsequently seized) and, among the 76
seized from SMGPA, 57 were redirected to new stores (22 of which
were subsequently seized). These responses by the counterfeiters
happened on average within 7 and 15 days of the initial seizure,
respectively, for GBC and SMGPA. Such domain agility suggests
the counterfeiters are well prepared for domain seizures, and as a
result such interventions are not likely to undermine their business.
6. CONCLUSION
Online business in counterfeit luxury goods is brisk: from the
site of just one supplier, we saw over 250,000 successfully deliv-
ered orders in nine months. Such businesses prosper by poisoning
search results for popular luxury goods to attract customers to their
online storefronts; for heavily-targeted brands, a third of the top
100 search results are so poisoned for months at a time.
In this paper we presented techniques for detecting poisoned
search results that lead users to counterfeit stores, and a classiﬁ-
cation approach for mapping the Web sites of these stores into dis-
tinct SEO campaigns that promote these sites. From eight months
of crawled search results for 16 brand verticals, we detected 2.7
million PSRs using 27 thousand doorway pages that redirect users
to 7,484 storefronts, and classiﬁed over half of the PSRs into 52
distinct SEO campaigns. Simultaneously, we created test orders
on stores to sample their order number sequence space to estimate
their order volume over time.
Finally, we used our crawler and order data to study the effects
of both search engine and domain seizure interventions on these
abusive SEO activities. Although we ﬁnd instances where both can
have the desired effect of disrupting counterfeit sales activity, over-
all neither are currently employed with the level of coverage or
responsiveness necessary to be broadly effective against the actors
in this market. Search engines and brand holders should take into
account that these activities are organized as business campaigns,
that effective interventions should target their infrastructure at the
granularity of these campaigns, and that they are being targeted
by dozens of campaigns. Otherwise campaigns have shown great
agility in adapting to partial intervention, and in ﬁlling in gaps left
by the disappearance of other campaigns. We believe that the mea-
surement and classiﬁcation techniques we describe in this paper
for identifying campaigns and their infrastructure could provide the
improved targeting required for more robust intervention.
