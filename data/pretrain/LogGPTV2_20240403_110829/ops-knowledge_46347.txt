User: I have just installed Python 3.5.1 on my Mac (running the latest version of OSX). My system came with Python 2.7 installed. When I type IDLE at the Terminal prompt my system pulls up the original Python 2.7 rather than the newly installed Python 3.5. How do I get my system to default to Python 3.5.1 when I open the IDLE window from Terminal?
Assistant: You can switch to any python version in your project by creating a virtual environment. 

virtualenv  -p /usr/bin/python2.x (or python 3.x)

In case you just want to run a program in a specific version just open shell and enter python2.x or python3.x
