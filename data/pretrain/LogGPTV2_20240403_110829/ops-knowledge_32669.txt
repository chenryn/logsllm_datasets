Question: "A security consultant reviews a web application's Content-Security-Policy header and notices that it includes 'default-src https: 'unsafe-inline''. Why might the consultant recommend removing 'unsafe-inline' from the CSP directive?"
 "A": "It may prevent the webpage from loading any third-party images or styles, affecting the site's functionality."
 "B": "It allows the execution of inline scripts, which does not provide protection against XSS attacks."
 "C": "It forces all resources to be loaded over HTTP, which is less secure than HTTPS."
 "D": "It blocks the reporting of CSP violations, making it difficult to monitor and fix potential security issues."
Answer: B
