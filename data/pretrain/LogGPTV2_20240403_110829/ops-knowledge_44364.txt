**Question:**
How can I set up email notifications to the administrator when users log in to a Linux server? I am looking for an easy way to configure my server so that I receive an email notification every time a user logs in. Can you provide any guidance on how to achieve this?

**Answer:**
To set up email notifications for user logins on a Linux server, you can use the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system, which has a pre-built notification module available. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. **Install the PAM Notification Module:**
   - You can find and download a suitable PAM notification module. One such module is `pam_exec`, which allows you to run a script or command upon authentication.
   - Install the module if it is not already available on your system.

2. **Configure PAM:**
   - Edit the appropriate PAM configuration file, typically located in `/etc/pam.d/` (e.g., `/etc/pam.d/sshd` for SSH logins).
   - Add a line to include the `pam_exec` module and specify the script or command to be executed. For example:
     ```plaintext
     session    required     pam_exec.so /path/to/your/notification_script.sh
     ```

3. **Create the Notification Script:**
   - Write a script (e.g., `notification_script.sh`) that sends an email to the administrator. Ensure the script is executable.
   - Example script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "User $PAM_USER logged in from $PAM_RHOST at $(date)" | mail -s "Login Notification" admin@example.com
     ```

4. **Test the Configuration:**
   - After configuring PAM and creating the script, test the setup by logging in as a user and verifying that the email notification is sent to the administrator.

**Alternative Method:**
If your users are restricted to specific shells and all process the `/etc/profile` file (as is common with Bash), you can also add a login notification script directly to the `/etc/profile` file. This method, however, may not be as reliable as the PAM approach, especially for non-interactive logins.

```bash
# /etc/profile
if [ "$PS1" ]; then
  echo "User $USER logged in from $SSH_CONNECTION at $(date)" | mail -s "Login Notification" admin@example.com
fi
```

By following these steps, you should be able to set up effective email notifications for user logins on your Linux server.
