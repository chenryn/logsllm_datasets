User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to email / notify admin when users log in to the linux server I'm looking for an easy way to configure my server, so that whenever a user logs into it, I get an email about it.

Any pointers around how to get this working?

Assistant: Somebody has already built a notification module for PAM. I would look into downloading that and entering an appropriate configuration line in your related /etc/pam.d/ files.

If your users are restricted in what shells they select and they all process /etc/profile (bash does), you can write a script into that.
