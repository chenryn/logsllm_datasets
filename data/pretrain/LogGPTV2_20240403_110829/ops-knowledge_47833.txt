User: How to perform system monitoring and troubleshooting, and provide common system monitoring tools and troubleshooting methods.
Assistant: System monitoring methods: 1. Determine the monitoring target: You can determine which indicators need to be monitored according to your own task requirements, such as: CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, etc. 2. Select a monitoring tool: Select a tool that can monitor the required indicators according to specific needs, such as the commonly used Zabbix, Nagios, Prometheus, etc. 3. Configure monitoring items: According to the characteristics of the selected tool, configure the indicators to be monitored in the program. 4. Install the agent: the agent can regularly send data reports to the monitoring center, and the monitoring center collects corresponding data for processing and analysis. 5. Set reminders: When an abnormality is found in the system, the administrator will be reminded in time to troubleshoot as soon as possible. Troubleshooting methods: 1. Log analysis: Check the error information in the log file to determine the cause and location of the error. 2. Troubleshoot software problems: close the software and restart, or use other software for testing. 3. Troubleshoot hardware problems: Check the connection of hardware devices to confirm whether the devices are faulty. 4. System rollback: restore the system to the previous state. Common system monitoring tools: 1. Zabbix: It can monitor networks, servers, cloud services, applications, etc., and supports multiple operating systems better. 2. Nagios: It is mainly used for monitoring servers and network devices, and can check host status, service status, and network traffic. 3. Prometheus: Mainly used for time series monitoring, it is useful for monitoring and alarming large-scale distributed systems. Common troubleshooting tools: 1. ping and traceroute: used to troubleshoot network faults, detect network connectivity and RTT, etc. 2. netstat: View network connections and network traffic, and troubleshoot network problems. 3. top, ps, htop, etc.: View process information, CPU and memory usage, and find system freezes, crashes, etc. 4. dmesg: It is used to view error and warning information when the system starts, and can also perform hardware troubleshooting.
