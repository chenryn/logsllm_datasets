Hi many times people need to use Twitter Bootstrap on only part of a web page
or to otherwise have a prefix class to reduce the scope of the Bootstrap CSS.
This can be accomplished in LESS , see
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11831346/applying-css-styles-only-to-
certain-elements
    .bootstrap-container {
        @import "/path-to-bootstrap-less.less"
        @import "/path-to-bootstrap-responsive-less.less"
    }
It would be great if there was an option on the bootstrap customization page
to add an optional prefix to all css elements. Thanks!
