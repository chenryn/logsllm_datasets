**ATT&CK ID:** M1024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Restrict Registry Permissions

**Description:**
To prevent adversaries from disabling or interfering with logging, it is essential to ensure that proper permissions are set on the Windows Registry. One specific example is the addition of the `MiniNT` registry key, which can disable the Event Viewer. By restricting access to this and other critical registry keys, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect against unauthorized modifications.
