3  Experimental Result 
3.1  Data Collection and Feature Selection 
The  features  of  a  vulnerability  are  extracted  from  National 
Vulnerability  Database  (NVD),  Common  Vulnerabilities  and 
Figure 2: Model features for exploit prediction. 
Features after no. 50  are the keywords list for counting word 
frequency.  We  can  see  these  keywords  are  all  cybersecurity 
related terms, and some of them are specifically mentioned about 
vulnerability, exploit and hacking staff.  
3.2  Prediction Performance 
We use year 1999 to year 2018 as training period and year 2019 
as  testing  period.  To  prevent  data  from  overly  imbalanced,  the 
ratio of exploit sample and non-exploit sample is set to  1: 3. We 
got  98.06%  accuracy  with  Type  I  error  1.8%  and  Type  II  error 
6.56%. Table 1 shows the exploited CVEs mentioned in 2019. Class 
Poster Session ASIA CCS '20, October 5–9, 2020, Taipei, Taiwan8931  means  predicted  as  exploited,  and  class  2  means  predicted  as 
non-exploit. Currently, we set 0.5 as the threshold for exploit and 
non-exploit  class.  In  Table  1,  except  CVE-2017-5487  has  higher 
class 0 score than class 1 score and both of these two scores are 
very  closed  to  0.5,  other  CVEs  are  correctly  predicted  as  class  1 
(exploited).  The  classification  accuracy  of  RF  with  topic  model 
(98.06%) is superior than the classification accuracy of SVM model 
(92.81%).    Therefore,  the  proposed  vulnerability  threat  prediction 
model can successfully alert high-risk vulnerabilities.

The  approach  and  has  been  deployed 
into  our  threat 
intelligence platform as one of the analytic functions. Figure 3 and 
Figure  4  show  the  system  UI  regarding  the  vulnerability 
intelligence.  The  predicted  risk  score  named  as  ‘SecScore’,  along 
with  CVSS  v2,  CVSS  v3,  and  other  information  can  provide 
decision  support  for  organization  to  prioritize  their  vulnerability 
patching schedule.

2  Conclusion 
In  this  study,  we  propose  a  dynamic  vulnerability  threat 
assessment model to  predict vulnerabilities that will be exploited 
in  the  near  future  and  should  be  addressed  immediately.  The 
novelty  of  this  work  is to  address  the  pain  point in  cyber  threat 
mitigation  practice,  which 
information  aggregation  and 
prioritization. We believe that we are the first one to deploy this 
technology  to  the  threat  intelligence  platform  to  enrich  the 
vulnerability intelligence that have been correlated from multiple 
sources.  
is 
Our future work would be: (1) improve the model sustainability 
by  continuing  the  experiment  to  deploy  moving  window 
mechanism  to  provide  monthly  CVE  threat  assessment,  (2)  not 
only  predicting  the  threat  level  of  CVE,  but  also  set  up  threat 
assessment  model  for  exploit  codes  which  are  shared  on  the 
hacker forum or dark web market without CVE numbers, and (3) 
continue  to  automatically  suggest  monitored  keywords  toward 
topic modeling on twitter data in cybersecurity communities.
