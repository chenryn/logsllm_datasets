ABSTRACT
Electric power grids are among the largest human-made control
structures and are considered as critical infrastructure due to their
importance for daily life. When operating a power grid, providers
have to continuously maintain a balance between supply (i.e., pro-
duction in power plants) and demand (i.e., power consumption) to
keep the power grid’s nominal frequency of 50 Hz or alternatively
60 Hz. Power consumption is forecast by elaborated models includ-
ing multiple parameters like weather, season, and time of the day;
they are based on the premise of many small consumers averaging
out their energy consumption spikes.
In this paper, we develop attacks violating this assumption, in-
vestigate their impact on power grid operation, and assess their
feasibility for today’s adversaries. In our scenario, an adversary
builds (or rents) a botnet of zombie computers and modulates their
power consumption, e.g., by utilizing CPU, GPU, hard disks, screen
brightness, and laser printers in a coordinated way over the In-
ternet. Outperforming the grid’s countervailing mechanisms in
time, the grid is pushed into unstable states triggering automated
load shedding or tie-line tripping. We show that an adversary does
not have to rely on smart grid features to modulate power con-
sumption given that an adequate communication infrastructure for
striking the (legacy) power grid is currently nearly omnipresent:
the Internet to whom more and more power-consuming devices
are connected.
Our simulations estimate that between 2.5 and 9.8 million in-
fections are sufficient to attack the European synchronous grid –
depending on the mix of infected devices, the current mix of active
power plant types, and the current overall produced power. How-
ever, the herein described attack mechanisms are not limited to the
European grid.

1 INTRODUCTION
Electric power grids are among the largest human-made structures
and by far the most important for technology-dependent societies.
Without electricity, life as we know it would not function; there
would be breakdowns in water and food supply, transport, medical
aid, and communication infrastructures. For this reason, power
grids are considered critical infrastructures, and operated with a
high level of care to provide qualitative service, i.e., constant voltage
and frequency. At the same time, power grids are legacy systems
pre-dating modern telecommunication networks — such as the
Internet — by decades, as is reflected in its structure: Electricity
consumers are predominantly uncontrolled, i.e., consuming electric
power whenever they need thereby causing fluctuations in con-
sumption. However, on a macro scale fluctuations average out: for
each consumer turning a light bulb off there is most likely another
one turning the light on. Energy suppliers have developed sophisti-
cated models that reliably forecast power demand in dependence
of time of the day, week day, season and many other parameters
allowing (centralized) power plants to trace actual consumption
best possible in order to keep the equilibrium of production and
consumption; the remaining gap is placed at disposal by so called
control reserves (spinning reserve in the U.S.), i.e., the activation of
power plants in stand-by.
Power grids around the globe currently undergo substantial mod-
ifications commonly summarized under the term smart grid, and the
included concepts put an end to the strict separation of controlled
production and uncontrolled consumption. On the one hand, renew-
ables like wind turbines and photovoltaics provide electric energy
in dependence of weather conditions and are thus only to a certain
extent predictable, not to mention arbitrarily controllable. On the
other hand, demand-side management aims to shift certain types of
consumption, e.g., heating or cooling, in time. Synchronized over a
communication channel, energy should then be consumed at the
time of production by renewables. Due to such remote control of
high amounts of power consumption, the smart grid is considered
to be vulnerable to direct cyber attacks aiming to destabilize the
system [28, 64].
303In this paper, we show that an adversary does not have to rely
on explicit (or future) smart grid features to modulate power con-
sumptions, as the communication infrastructure to attack the legacy
grid is already available: the Internet. An adversary might compro-
mise a large number of Internet-facing power-drawing devices, e.g.,
computers, TVs, or thermostats controlling heating systems, and
modulate their power consumption in a coordinated way (Figure 1).
As these fluctuations are at a large scale, fast and unpredictable,
power plants are not able to trace power consumption any more
causing an imbalance of production and consumption and eventu-
ally load-shedding, disconnection of power plants, disconnection
of transmission lines, or a split of one synchronous power grid into
multiple areas. Our attack benefits from the fact that the power grid
is substantially slower in reaction than information technology,
and will become even more vulnerable in the future, as control-
lable power consumption (with a potentially low level of security
protection) increases due to the spread of the Internet-of-Things
(IoT).
In this paper, we focus primarily on the synchronous grid of
Continental Europe (also known as UCTE grid) as it is the largest
of its kind spanning over 23 countries, including large parts of
Europe, North Africa as well as Turkey, and cite the respective
UCTE/ENTSO-E policies. While terminology and details might
differ in other synchronous grids, e.g., in the United States, we
want to stress that the general principles, attacks, and conclusions
apply to AC power grids all over the world.
The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides background
on today’s power grids from an engineering perspective. Section 3
describes our attack scenarios and the anatomy of the adversary’s
botnet for these attacks. It goes without saying that such an at-
tack can ethically never be tested on a real power grid. Thus, we
measure the capabilities for load modulation of a zombie and its
peripherals in Section 4 and use simulations to predict the impact of
large load changes on the power grid in Section 5. In Section 6, we
combine the gained results into multiple scenarios and assess the
number of infections needed considering parameters like time of
the day, season, etc. Section 7 discusses related work, and Section 8
concludes the paper.
2 BACKGROUND
This section provides background on the power grid from an engi-
neering perspective and an introduction into control theory, dis-
cussing feedback loops and resonance frequencies.
2.1 Producer-Consumer Equilibrium
Electric power cannot be stored at large scale, i.e., must be gen-
erated and consumed at the same time. In consequence, the chal-
lenge when operating a power grid is to maintain an equilibrium
of electric power supplied by power plants and power consumed
by electric loads. Apart from a few consumers with extraordinary
high consumption — e.g., aluminum foundries and steel mills — are
uncontrolled, i.e., they turn their power consumption on and off
whenever they need or feel to. Thus, keeping a balance between
supply and demand has become the suppliers’ tasks – their power
plants’ production has to trace current consumption.

Scheduling power plants in order to deliver enough electric
power at all times is a non-trivial task, which is fulfilled by applying
a two-fold approach: elaborated models were developed describing
overall power consumption in dependence of type of load (com-
mercial or residential), time of the day, week day, season, weather
and many parameters more allowing a quite accurate prediction
of power consumption. Secondly, the remaining gap is handled by
control reserve, i.e., additional power production capacities that are
kept in stand-by and activated if needed [55, 56].
If production and consumption are imbalanced, frequency de-
viates from its nominal value f0 (in Europe f0 = 50 Hz, in the US
f0 = 60 Hz): If there is more supply than demand, the frequency
increases; if there is less supply than demand, the frequency de-
creases. This happens, because large spinning turbines produce
the vast majority of electricity in today’s power grids and store
rotational energy, i.e., kinetic energy due to rotation. In case of
over-supply, conservation of energy produces additional torque
on the generator’s spinning axis and accelerates the turbine, i.e.,
energy supplied to the turbine is converted into mechanical energy
instead of electric energy. As the turbine speed and the grid fre-
quency are rigidly coupled, the grid frequency increases as well.
Vice versa, higher power consumption slows down the generator
due to a counter-torque on the spinning axis and lowers the output
frequency. In fact, a grid’s frequency deviation ∆f = f − f0 with
f being the current value is used as the primary indicator for an
imbalance in demand and supply and triggers the control reserve,
bringing the power grid back into equilibrium.
Due to minor imbalances, frequency is fluctuating around the
nominal value even under normal operational conditions due to
minor imbalances. If deviations are larger than a pre-defined thresh-
old, emergency routines are performed to bring the power grid back
into balance. For example, German regulations define a five-step
plan for load-shedding in case frequency drops under certain val-
ues [20], see Table 1. These routines protect turbines and other
physical devices from damage, e.g., due to resonant frequencies.
2.2 Continental Synchronous Grid Area
Historically, power grids were “islands” with a single power gen-
erator which were then stepwise integrated into larger grids for
reasons of reliability and costs. Also, consumption spikes are likely
to be handled better by multiple power plants. Cheaper (but typi-
cally less controllable) power plants are able to produce the base
load, more expensive (and dynamic and more controllable) plants
handle peak loads. Nowadays, networks are operated on a national,
even continental level.
304A parallel operation of generators requires coherence, i.e., opera-
tion at exactly the same frequency and in phase, leading to synchro-
nous grid areas. Misalignment, e.g., in extreme case, one generator
is at the positive peak of a sine, while another is at the negative
peak, will result in major short-circuit like currents potentially
leading to fire or physical destruction. The biggest synchronous
area is the continental synchronous grid area, also called synchronous
grid of continental Europe, comprising most of the European Union,
Switzerland, many Balkan countries as well as three North African
states; there are also plans for further expansion. This implies that
the sine at a power plug in Athens, Greece is the same as another
one obtained in Lisbon, Portugal or Tunis, Tunisia. It has a total
production capacity of more than 600 GW and a nominal frequency
of 50 Hz.
The continental synchronous grid is organizationally split into
control zones which are led by a transmission system operator
(TSO) [57]. Control zones are the size of a smaller European coun-
try like Austria or Switzerland and mostly follow national borders
or geographical landmarks. Larger countries are split into multiple
control zones, e.g., Germany has four. Control zones have connec-
tions with adjacent zones via transmission lines. However, their
capacity covers only a fraction of the power consumption and is
mostly meant for the compensation of power imbalances.
TSOs are unified in the European Network of Transmission System
Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) which defines regulations on
how to jointly operate the grid. Among these regulations, ENTSO-E
specifies the provision and application of control reserve in three
steps to balance production and consumption, namely primary,
secondary and tertiary control as described in the following para-
graphs [55, 56].
ACE = Pmeasured − Pplanned + K · (f − f0)
(1)
Pmeasured is the sum of measured power transfers on transmission
lines, Pplanned the sum of planned power exchanges with adjacent
zones, and K is the network power frequency characteristic of the
primary control. If all produced primary control is exported into
other control zones, ACE is zero and secondary control remains
On the physical level, before any control system kicks in, the
rotational energy stored in the spinning turbines stabilizes the
frequency to a certain extent.
Primary control is activated within seconds after an incident –
i.e., frequency deviation is exceeding a certain threshold – and the
first to actively react to a power imbalance. Primary control is ap-
plied in proportion to the frequency deviation, i.e., K · (f − f0), and
does not bring the frequency back to nominal, it rather stabilizes
the frequency at a stationary value. In practice, a control system
(governor) within the power plant observes the grid frequency
and decides whether to increase or decrease power output. In pri-
mary control, all generators in the synchronous area participate
simultaneously.
Secondary control is activated after 30 seconds and takes some
minutes until full activation. Its task is to replace primary control
