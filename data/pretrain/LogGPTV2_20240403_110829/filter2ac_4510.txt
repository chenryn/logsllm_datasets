### Title: The Path Less Traveled: Abusing Kubernetes Defaults

Kubernetes is a widely adopted container orchestration framework, used extensively in both enterprise and other environments. While the industry is beginning to focus on Kubernetes security, many attack vectors remain poorly documented and rarely discussed. This lack of information can leave clusters vulnerable.

In this talk, filled with live demonstrations, we will explore the Kubernetes control plane and use `sigs.k8s.io/kind` to highlight the attack surface exposed by default configurations. We will present multiple exploits, including cluster takeovers and host escapes, involving various components. Additionally, we will discuss mitigation strategies and demonstrate how these defenses can be circumvented.

It's important to note that all the exploits in this talk leverage features, not bugs. Kubernetes is powerful but inherently insecure by design. Our goal is to illustrate its capabilities and then provide guidance on how to better secure your clusters.

By the end of this session, attendees will have a deeper understanding of the default attack surface in Kubernetes, the methods by which it can be exploited, and practical steps to enhance the security of their clusters.
