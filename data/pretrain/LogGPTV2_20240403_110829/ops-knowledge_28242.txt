User: I want to hide the console window of a python program, so I change the file extensions to "pyw", but when I open it, the python IDLE show up even though I choose open it with "pythonw.exe"
If I use "pythonw test.py" in cmd, it works.
So I want to know what's wrong with this and how to solve this, thank you.
Assistant: For me, I had multiple version of Python installed that was causing issues. Once I had only had one version, I applied that pythonw.exe was the default for .pyw files and it worked.
