Improving Mental Models of End-to-End Encryption

Abstract
As large messaging providers increasingly adopt end-to-end
encryption, private communication is readily available to
more users than ever before. However, misunderstandings
of end-to-end encryption’s beneﬁts and shortcomings limit
people’s ability to make informed choices about how and
when to use these services. This paper explores the poten-
tial of using short educational messages, built into messaging
workﬂows, to improve users’ functional mental models of
secure communication. A preliminary survey study (n=461)
ﬁnds that such messages, when used in isolation, can eﬀec-
tively improve understanding of several key concepts. We
then conduct a longitudinal study (n=61) to test these mes-
sages in a more realistic environment: embedded into a secure
messaging app. In this second study, we do not ﬁnd statisti-
cally signiﬁcant evidence of improvement in mental models;
however, qualitative evidence from participant interviews sug-
gests that if made more salient, such messages could have
potential to improve users’ understanding.
1 Introduction
Recent adoption of end-to-end encryption (e2e encryption)
by popular messaging apps such as iMessage, Facebook Mes-
senger, and Whatsapp [6,22,23] has enabled strong communi-
cations privacy protections for billions of users globally [69].
People, however, often fail to use e2e encrypted apps conﬁ-
dently and correctly [2, 27]. Often this is because they misun-
derstand key aspects of e2e encryption, sometimes believing
it protects from broad classes of “hacking” [2], and sometimes
believing any attempt at ensuring privacy is hopeless in the
face of powerful or skilled adversaries [2,3,17,27]. Users also
struggle to choose appropriate communication mechanisms
for sharing private information [2, 3, 27].
For people to make good decisions about their communica-
tions — including opting for more private communications
when appropriate — they need to develop strong functional
mental models of secure communications. Mental models re-
fer to a user’s understanding of how a system works, its inputs
and outputs, and other eﬀects that can be expected from using
it. Functional models, speciﬁcally, are not directly about how
a system works but rather help a user to understand when to
use a system and predict how it will behave [19]; as such, they
need not be fully correct in all details, but must be suﬃcient to
be useful. Unfortunately, existing functional models of secure
communication are often inadequate [2, 17, 36, 40].
Various attempts at inﬂuencing these mental models ex-
ist both in the research literature and in the broader privacy
community. Organizations like the Electronic Freedom Foun-
dation, Citizen Lab, and the Library Freedom Project have
produced broad guidance for improving personal privacy and
security, including discussion of secure messaging [20,21,42].
Researchers have tested a variety of metaphors for better ex-
plaining encryption, with only limited success [18,60]. Others
have worked to make authentication ceremonies more usable,
again with mixed results [56, 63, 64, 72].
In prior work, we were able to meaningfully improve users’
understanding by asking them to complete a brief tutorial
as part of a larger experiment on secure messaging prefer-
ences [8]. However, it is of course not realistic to expect many
users to sit down and participate in a tutorial when they are
not being paid as experimental participants.
This raises the question of whether it is possible to convey
some of the key information that might be included in such a
tutorial more naturally, for example during splash or intersti-
tial screens within a messaging app, or as reminders inserted
automatically by the software during a text conversation. This
approach builds on a long tradition in the human-centered se-
curity community of nudging users toward privacy-protective
behaviors [4, 5, 12, 37, 41, 65, 66, 72].
In this paper, we investigate the potential of in-workﬂow
educational messages to help users improve their functional
mental models of e2e encryption and therefore their commu-
nications decision-making. To this end, we design a series of
messages with diﬀerent lengths, emphasizing diﬀerent key
principles related to e2e encryption. These messages build
directly on our prior work exploring which e2e encryption
concepts are most important and useful to convey to users [9].

We preliminarily test these messages using an online sur-
vey study with lay users (n=461) and ﬁnd the messages are
generally eﬀective at improving participants’ understanding.
Longer messages are most eﬀective, while shorter messages
can successfully convey speciﬁc points, at the possible risk of
enabling misunderstandings of concepts that aren’t covered.
We then embed our short messages into a chat app (adapted
from Signal) and ask lay users (n=61) to use the app daily
for about three weeks. Unfortunately, we ﬁnd no statistical
evidence that these embedded messages eﬀectively improved
mental models. A post-study interview (n=19) suggests that
although many participants noticed our messages, they did
not pay attention to them, limiting their impact.
Overall our results, while somewhat disappointing, suggest
short educational messages can be useful if users pay atten-
tion to them. This provides some hope that if in-workﬂow
messages are made more salient (and perhaps somewhat more
intrusive), they may have potential to improve mental models
and support better communications privacy decision-making.
2 Related work
We discuss related work in three key areas.
Usability, adoption, and mental models of encrypted com-
munication tools
For more than 20 years, researchers
have been exploring the usability and adoption of encrypted
communications tools. Extensive studies of encrypted email
tools have identiﬁed a range of issues that inhibit adoption
and use, including challenges in key management, complex
interfaces, social and cultural factors, network eﬀects, and
user misunderstandings [8, 24–26, 47–50, 53].
The incorporation of e2e encryption into centralized secure-
messaging apps has reduced the salience of key manage-
ment, although several researchers have documented remain-
ing challenges in authenticating keys [56, 64]. Researchers
have demonstrated that network eﬀects play a large role in in-
hibiting adoption of security-focused messaging apps [3, 36],
but the integration of e2e encryption into already-popular
apps such as WhatsApp and iMessage has to a large extent
overcome this problem [69].
Adoption, however, has not proven entirely suﬃcient. In
interviews and surveys, researchers ﬁnd that many users do
not believe that e2e encrypted tools provide meaningful pro-
tection [2, 3, 17, 27]. As a result, people frequently make less
than optimal choices about how to communicate sensitive
information — such as preferring SMS messaging [3, 17] —
or use ad-hoc protection strategies [27].
These misconceptions appear to arise from incorrect or im-
precise mental models of encrypted communication, such as
beliefs that anyone with computer-science knowledge or who
knows an encryption algorithm can decrypt its results [3, 17],
misunderstandings of the role of service providers in commu-
nication paths [17], and distinctions between e2e encryption
and other kinds of communications [3, 17, 40]. These misun-
derstandings reﬂect broader inaccuracies in mental models
of encryption generally [73], as well as common beliefs re-
garding security or privacy generally that “ordinary” people
are not important or valuable enough to be targeted [67]. In
this paper, we measure changes in mental models in part by
looking speciﬁcally for misunderstandings and key concepts
identiﬁed in the prior works cited here.
Nudging security and privacy behaviors
Attempts to
integrate security or privacy warnings or messages into UI
elements and workﬂows, prompting more secure or private
behavior, are sometimes known as nudging [4, 41]. Exam-
ples include improving feedback during password creation
(e.g., [61]), during software updates (e.g., [38]), and dur-
ing semi-automated checks for malware [12]. Nudging has
also been used to promote privacy-preserving behavior in the
context of social media [37, 65, 66] and mobile app permis-
sions [5], and even correct use of authentication ceremonies
in encrypted messaging [72].
Rather than prompting speciﬁc behaviors, our in-workﬂow
messages are intended to improve users’ understanding and
functional mental models. In a sense, we seek to improve on
resources such as existing tooltips in e2e encrypted messaging
apps, which have been shown to be ineﬀective [17].
Teaching encryption and secure communication
Re-
searchers have experimented with a variety of encryption
metaphors, none of which has as yet been highly success-
ful [18,60]. Although we do use a lock-key metaphor in some
of our messages, we mainly follow results from our prior
work which suggest focusing primarily on functional models
— what e2e encryption can and cannot do — rather than on
structural information about how e2e encryption works [9].
Researchers have also focused attention on improving
users’ understanding of and facility with authentication cere-
monies [56, 62, 63, 72]. Because it has been covered in depth
previously, we do not address authentication ceremonies in
this work. However, our work does use similar methods and
could be combined with prior work on ceremoneis [72] to
provide a more complete view of e2e encryption.
Nonproﬁt and advocacy organizations have produced blog
posts, interactive guides, infographics, and other educational
materials related to personal privacy and security, including
secure communications [20, 21, 42]. These tutorials serve
a diﬀerent niche than our work; they focus on aiding (in
detail) people who seek out guidance in privacy and secure
messaging, while we target small, high-level improvements
for casual users. We do, however, incorporate some concepts
from these tutorials into the messages we design.
We build directly on our prior work using tutorials and par-
ticipatory design to explore which concepts and explanations
related to e2e encryption are most important, surprising, and
challenging for users [9]. Those results suggest focusing on
conﬁdentiality and explicit discussion of risks, while noting

that certain misconceptions are diﬃcult to overcome. Educa-
tional messages in this study were based on these ﬁndings.
3 Survey Study: Methods
We ﬁrst conducted an online, between-subjects study to pre-
liminarily measure the eﬀectiveness of brief educational mes-
sages for e2e encryption novices. As with our prior work,
our messages emphasize actionable information about threats,
non-threats, and appropriate usage of e2e encryption, rather
than focusing on how encryption works [9].
We recruited participants from the Proliﬁc.1 After con-
sent, participants were directed to an online survey consisting
of ﬁve parts. First, we asked background questions about
self-reported knowledge of technical and encryption concepts
as well as general web-use concepts [29], in order to ﬁlter
out participants with too much expertise. Second, we intro-
duced TextLight, a hypothetical e2e encrypted application.2
Third, to obtain a baseline of participants’ mental models,
they completed a pre-intervention questionnaire (described
in Section 3.1). Fourth, they viewed one educational message
we created (detailed in Section 3.2). Fifth, they completed
a post-intervention questionnaire containing the same ques-
tions as the pre-intervention questionnaire, allowing us to
measure diﬀerences. Finally, the participants answered demo-
graphic questions. Throughout the study, we referenced e2e
encryption in the context of TextLight, to make the concept
concrete3.
Our study protocol was approved by the University of Mary-
land Institutional Review Board (IRB).
3.1 Communications privacy questionnaire
We investigate knowledge of privacy threats by asking ques-
tions about the capabilities of various adversaries (see Ta-
ble 1 ). Participants were asked, on a 5-point Likert scale
(strongly disagree to strongly agree), “Based on your under-
standing of TextLight’s end-to-end encryption, please indicate
whether you agree or disagree that [ADVERSARY] has/have
the following abilities, regardless of their motivation to do so."
We use Likert scales to enable detection of smaller shifts in
mental models (compared to binary-choice questions). Sim-
ilar methodology has been shown to be eﬀective in prior
work [9,46]. We asked this question for every combination of
the adversaries and capabilities listed in Table 1.
The adversaries and capabilities we selected were mainly
adopted from prior work [2, 9, 18] and in many cases reﬂect
real-world examples of privacy breaches [1, 10, 16, 30, 70].
The adversaries roughly ﬁt into three top level categories: (1)
endpoint adversaries, (2) communication providers, and (3)

avoid confounds related to participants’ trust in diﬀerent brands [33].

outsiders who might be capable of intercepting communica-
tions. The capabilities capture privacy attacks e2e encryption
can and cannot protect against. They address conﬁdential-
ity, integrity, and authenticity, as well as the capability to
learn metadata. Finally, to address diﬀerences between e2e
encrypted and non-e2e encrypted tools, we ask participants
to rate the chance of each adversary reading the contents of a
message if TextLight were not e2e encrypted.
After the adversary/capability questions each participant
was asked one free-response question about why they gave
their speciﬁc answer for one adversary/capability pair, cho-
sen at random per participant. We use these responses as
an attention check and to validate that our participants were
interpreting the questions as we had intended.
3.2 Educational messages
When creating new educational messages about end-to-end en-
cryption, we ﬁrst surveyed existing messages from academia
[9,18,72,73] and industry [6,23,43,44,52,54,57,59,71]. We
extracted key concepts from these materials and synthesized
them into ﬁve principles:
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    449
• Conﬁdentiality. The most frequently mentioned concept
in the prior work we reviewed; we previously found it the
most important aspect to convey [9]. We aimed to explain
that e2e encryption protects the content of messages from
adversaries between the sender and intended recipient.
• Risks. Risk communication has been shown to be eﬀective
both in computer security broadly [7, 13] and secure mes-
saging speciﬁcally [9,72]. Our previous work suggests spe-
ciﬁc risks were both important and surprising to users [9].
We aim to point out speciﬁc adversaries and their capabili-
ties, with an emphasis on comparing risks with and without
e2e encryption.
• Mechanism. Our goal here was not to communicate tech-
nical details, but rather convey a simpliﬁed structural
model of e2e encryption to support our key functional con-
cepts [19]. Our previous work suggested this kind of in-
