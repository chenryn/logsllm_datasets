## Abstract

As major messaging platforms increasingly adopt end-to-end encryption (E2EE), private communication has become more accessible to a broader user base. However, misunderstandings about E2EE's benefits and limitations hinder users' ability to make informed decisions about its use. This paper investigates the potential of integrating short educational messages into messaging workflows to enhance users' functional mental models of secure communication. A preliminary survey (n=461) indicates that such messages, when used in isolation, can effectively improve understanding of key concepts. A subsequent longitudinal study (n=61) embedded these messages into a secure messaging app but found no statistically significant improvement in mental models. Qualitative data from participant interviews suggest that making these messages more prominent could potentially enhance user understanding.

## 1. Introduction

The recent adoption of end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by popular messaging apps like iMessage, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp has provided strong privacy protections for billions of users globally. However, many users fail to use E2EE confidently and correctly due to misconceptions. For example, some users believe E2EE protects against all forms of "hacking," while others feel that any attempt at privacy is futile against powerful adversaries. Users also struggle to choose appropriate communication methods for sharing sensitive information.

To make informed decisions about their communications, users need to develop robust functional mental models of secure communication. These models help users understand when and how to use a system, even if they do not fully grasp all technical details. Unfortunately, existing functional models of secure communication are often inadequate.

Various efforts have been made to influence these mental models, both in research and by privacy organizations. For instance, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Citizen Lab, and the Library Freedom Project have produced guidance on personal privacy and secure messaging. Researchers have tested metaphors and authentication ceremonies with mixed results. Our prior work showed that brief tutorials can meaningfully improve users' understanding, but it is unrealistic to expect many users to complete such tutorials outside of a paid experimental setting.

This raises the question of whether key information can be conveyed more naturally, such as through splash or interstitial screens within a messaging app or as reminders during text conversations. This approach builds on the tradition of nudging users toward privacy-protective behaviors.

In this paper, we investigate the potential of in-workflow educational messages to improve users' functional mental models of E2EE. We design a series of messages with varying lengths, emphasizing different key principles related to E2EE. These messages are based on our prior work, which identified the most important and useful concepts to convey to users.

### 2.1 Usability, Adoption, and Mental Models of Encrypted Communication Tools

For over two decades, researchers have explored the usability and adoption of encrypted communication tools. Studies of encrypted email tools have identified challenges such as key management, complex interfaces, social and cultural factors, network effects, and user misunderstandings. The integration of E2EE into centralized messaging apps has reduced some of these issues, but challenges remain, particularly in authenticating keys. Network effects still play a role in inhibiting the adoption of security-focused messaging apps, although the integration of E2EE into popular apps like WhatsApp and iMessage has largely overcome this problem.

Despite increased adoption, many users do not believe that E2EE provides meaningful protection. This leads to suboptimal choices, such as preferring SMS messaging or using ad-hoc protection strategies. Misconceptions arise from incorrect mental models, such as the belief that anyone with computer science knowledge can decrypt E2EE. These misunderstandings reflect broader inaccuracies in mental models of encryption and common beliefs that "ordinary" people are not valuable targets.

### 2.2 Nudging Security and Privacy Behaviors

Efforts to integrate security or privacy warnings into UI elements and workflows, known as nudging, aim to prompt more secure or private behavior. Examples include improving feedback during password creation, software updates, and malware checks. Nudging has also been used to promote privacy-preserving behavior in social media and mobile app permissions, and to correct the use of authentication ceremonies in encrypted messaging.

Our in-workflow messages aim to improve users' understanding and functional mental models rather than prompting specific behaviors. We seek to build on existing resources, such as tooltips in E2EE messaging apps, which have been shown to be ineffective.

### 2.3 Teaching Encryption and Secure Communication

Researchers have experimented with various encryption metaphors, though none have been highly successful. While we use a lock-key metaphor in some messages, we primarily focus on functional models—what E2EE can and cannot do—based on our prior work. We also incorporate concepts from educational materials produced by non-profit and advocacy organizations, which focus on aiding people who seek detailed guidance in privacy and secure messaging.

## 3. Survey Study: Methods

We conducted an online, between-subjects study to preliminarily measure the effectiveness of brief educational messages for E2EE novices. Our messages emphasize actionable information about threats, non-threats, and appropriate usage of E2EE, rather than focusing on how encryption works.

### 3.1 Communications Privacy Questionnaire

We investigated participants' knowledge of privacy threats by asking questions about the capabilities of various adversaries (see Table 1). Participants rated their agreement on a 5-point Likert scale. We asked these questions for every combination of adversaries and capabilities listed in Table 1.

| **Adversary** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Employee      | People employed by TextLight. |
| ISP           | Your mobile service provider (Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, etc.). |
| Hacker        | Hackers who have compromised the TextLight servers. |
| Government    | A government intelligence or national security agency. |
| Unlocked Phone | Someone who has access to your unlocked phone. |
| Malware       | Someone who has successfully installed malware on your phone. |

| **Capability** | **Description** |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Read          | Can see what is in the message you have sent on TextLight. |
| Change        | Can change what is in the message after it is sent through the TextLight app. |
| Impersonate   | Can pretend to be you on the TextLight app to send messages to other people in your name. |
| Metadata      | Can see that you have sent a message on TextLight, without knowing the content of the message. |
| Not-E2EE      | If TextLight IS NOT end-to-end encrypted, can see what is in the message you have sent on TextLight. |

After the adversary/capability questions, participants were asked a free-response question about one randomly chosen adversary/capability pair to validate their understanding.

### 3.2 Educational Messages

When creating new educational messages about E2EE, we surveyed existing messages from academia and industry. We extracted key concepts and synthesized them into five principles:

- **Confidentiality:** E2EE protects the content of messages from adversaries between the sender and intended recipient.
- **Risks:** Communicating specific risks, comparing scenarios with and without E2EE.
- **Mechanism:** Conveying a simplified structural model of E2EE to support key functional concepts.
- **Authentication:** Emphasizing the importance of verifying the identity of communication partners.
- **Usability:** Ensuring messages are clear and easy to understand.

These principles were used to create the educational messages for our study.
