    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. install sdl (i used macports)
    2. install go-sdl (github.com/banthar/Go-SDL). you can't use goinstall, and each
    makefile needs to be tweaked to include the following line:
    CGO_CFLAGS:=`pkg-config --cflags sdl | sed 's:\(-I[^ ]*\)/SDL:\1:'`)
    3. build and run Go-SDL/test/test
    this gives the error:
    libcgo: could not obtain pthread_keys
        wanted 0x108 and 0x109
        got 0x10b 0x10c 0x10d 0x10e 0x10f 0x110 0x111 0x112 0x113 0x114 0x115 0x116 0x117 
    0x118 0x119 0x11a
    it looks like libsdl has grabbed too many thread keys already
    before libcgo gets a look in. perhaps 0x108 and 0x109 should be
    considerably higher numbers.
    and indeed, when i change my local repository to use 0x128 and 0x129 (0x4e8)
    things get much further (still doesn't work, but that's another issue)
