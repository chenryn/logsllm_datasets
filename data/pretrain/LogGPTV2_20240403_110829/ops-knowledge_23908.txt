User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题User TFS sessions get disconnected From a while we are observing a strange issue with TFS - User sessions.
we are having a isolated environment(AD and TFS are set up in a different than local domain) for TFS .
Users report that their sessions on TFS/Visual studio get disconnected and after a while, they connect automatically.
I dont find anything suspicious in logs as well, as to if there is any tfs/db getting disconnected.

Can some one guide me how can i track the user session, as to why they get disconnected

Thanks,
Pasha

Assistant: One way to address this i found a workaround for this.
workaround solution to fix local user credentials.
This may happen when users dont select password remember while entering credentials.

Thanks,
