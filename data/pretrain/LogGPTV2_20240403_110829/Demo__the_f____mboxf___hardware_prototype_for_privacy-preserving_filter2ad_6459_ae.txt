oracle queries should run on all but two tags which are used
for the challenge phase. All the adversary needs to do is to
distinguish between those two tags. In fact, our assumption
about the tag responses is such that the output of the one-way
hash functions are indistinguishable from a random bit string
of equal length.
In [2], Bellare et al. show that it is impossible to achieve
public-channel key insulated security in the face of an active
adversary (who can compromise the secret key). Although
we follow the idea of key insulation from [7], assuming
passive adversary in case of RFID (who can eavesdrop only)
is not practical, as it
is easy for an adversary to break
into a tag’s memory. Considering this, the assumptions made
in our scheme (as well as in [16]) are more realistic to
achieve restricted backward security, and the other features
as well. However, many of the existing mutual authentication
protocols may support restricted backward security under our
assumption ([3], [19], [17] to name a few). But [3], [19]
require a tag to remember too many secrets. Moreover, [3],
[19] cannot provide forward security as shown by [13] and
[22], respectively. Again, [17] requires more computation than
our scheme, and it does not provide reader authentication.
Nevertheless, none of these protocols came up with a formal
model of backward security (even if not perfect).
Although it is not the primary target of our proposed pro-
tocol, it is also possible to prevent desynchronization attacks
[20] in our protocol to some extent. We consider the following
type of attack: If the last message is blocked, the tag updates
the shared secret key, (cid:7)(cid:3), but the server doesn’t. The server
and tag are no longer able to communicate successfully. To
prevent such an attack, the server has to remember the last
valid authentication session transcripts and the secret values.
When a server receives some random number instead of a
valid authentication value from a tag, the server updates itself
using the information from the last valid session, and tries
again to get synchronized with the tag. Although the question
of scalability is an issue here, this approach can help avoid
such desynchronization attacks in a limited way (of course
the system gets desynchronized if the last messages from two
consecutive sessions are blocked). Even though the system
gets desynchronized, an adversary can not trace a tag from
its desynchronized state, since the responses of a tag are
always pseudorandom, hence indistinguishable. However, we
17are more concerned with ‘exposure resilience’ of the secret
key and its effect on the authentication protocol, rather than
the desynchronization attacks. Providing full resistance against
desynchronization attacks is a separate issue.
We compare our work, based on security properties and
computational cost, with LK and SM schemes in Table II
below. According to [8], a scheme must satisfy both forward
security and indistinguishability in order to achieve ‘strong
location privacy’. If a scheme satisﬁes indistinguishability
only, the scheme is ‘weak location private’. [15] has shown
that SM scheme is not forward secure. So, SM scheme is weak
location private only, whereas our scheme is strong location
private. SM scheme furthermore does not give any formal
security model for indistinguishability and forward security.
Regarding computational requirements, our protocol requires
a simple one-way hash function, random number generation
and the XOR operation. We use a simple hash function like
SQUASH [12] to achieve forward security for the tag. This
requires around 1K gates.
As the server needs to authenticate itself ﬁrst to a tag, the
server must broadcast the authentication messages to the tags.
Since the server does not know the id of the tag that it wants
to authenticate, the server has to compute and broadcast the
authentication messages for all the tags in its storage. We
assume that the server has enough resource to perform such
computation. On the other hand, a tag receiving the broadcast
messages has to ﬁnd a match with it’s veriﬁcation value.
Although computing the veriﬁcation value is always constant,
ﬁnding a match increases the required computations according
to the number of broadcast messages in the worst case. As
stated earlier, such a scenario is unavoidable when we require
that a server should authenticate itself ﬁrst to a tag. We say
that our scheme is more suitable for an environment where
the reader must read a number of tags at a time (inventory
management) and/or where there are not too many tags (library
with a few thousand books).

V. CONCLUSION
We have proposed APRAP, a privacy-preserving mutual
RFID authentication protocol for shared key environment. The
protocol uses two different keys for mutual authentication.
The server sends a random partial key (generated from a
master secret key (cid:8) ) to a tag. The tag generates the
session key (cid:7) to authenticate itself to the server. The tag’s
secret key (cid:7) is updated using a partial key received from
the server. As (cid:7) is purely fresh for every time period, the
tag’s security is guaranteed for all other time periods (both
for the past and future) under our assumptions. We show that
our scheme is computationally more efﬁcient than the SM
and LK schemes. Our protocol satisﬁes indistinguishability,
and achieves both forward and restricted backward security
through key-insulation. We provide a formal security model
of the proposed protocol as well.
