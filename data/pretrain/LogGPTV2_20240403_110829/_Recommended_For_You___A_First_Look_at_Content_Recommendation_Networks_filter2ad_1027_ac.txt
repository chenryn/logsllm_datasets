unique. However, this statistic is somewhat misleading:
we see many ad URLs that include unique IDs in their
parameters, which we suspect are used by publishers to
implement conversion tracking and A/B testing. The
“No URL Params” line plots the distribution of pub-
lishers per ad when we ﬁlter out URL parameters, and
we observe that the percentage of unique ads drop to
85%.
Next, we aggregate ads based on the domain name
they point to. The “Ad Domains” line in Figure 5 plots
the distribution of publishers per advertised domain.
We observe that unlike ad URLs, 50% of advertised
domains appear on ≥5 publishers. The total number
of unique advertised domains in our dataset is 2,689,
which provides a rough lower-bound on the number of
advertisers that were using the ﬁve target CRNs be-
tween February 26–March 4, 2016 (when we performed
our crawls). This ﬁnding demonstrates that the pre-
dominant strategy used by advertisers on CRNs is to
ﬂood them with many unique ads.

Table 4: Number of advertised domains that al-
ways redirect to other sites.
As shown in Table 2, 79% of advertised domains only
appear in widgets from a single CRN. We only observe
eight advertisers that leveraged four CRNs. This reveals
that advertisers prefer to work with a single platform
to distribute their ads.
Redirection.
Of course, just because an ad links to
a domain d does not mean d is the ﬁnal destination: d
may redirect the user to another domain entirely. To in-
vestigate the landing domains that users are directed to,
we crawled all 131K ads in our dataset. For this crawl,
we used a highly instrumented browser that records all
information about redirects, even when they are initi-
ated by JavaScript or Flash [1].
Note that when we visit the ad URLs, we bypass the
initial redirect through the CRN, meaning that the ad-
vertiser will not be billed by the CRN for our impres-
sions. We were able to avoid visiting the CRNs due to
a quirk in their implementations. All ﬁve CRNs embed
advertisers’ URLs into their HTML; however, they dy-
namically replace the advertiser URL with a link point-
ing to the CRN when a user clicks the link. In our case,
we do not click on advertiser URLs, and thus never
trigger the dynamic redirects. Rather, we extract the
advertiser URLs from the HTML and visit them sepa-
rately using our instrumented browser.
The “Landing Domains” line in Figure 5 plots the
distribution of publishers per landing domain. Surpris-
ingly, we see an increase in the number of unique landing
domains compared to ad domains (from 25% to 30%).
This reveals that some of the ad domains redirect users
to other sites. Table 4 shows that there are 466 ad
domains that always redirect to a speciﬁc landing do-
main, while 383 ad domains redirect to >1 landing do-
main. The ad domain with widest fanout in our dataset
is DoubleClick, which redirected to 93 diﬀerent landing
domains.
4.5 Advertisers and Content
Now that we have traveled down the advertising fun-
nel, we turn our attention to the advertisers themselves,
and the content that is being advertised via CRNs.
We use two metrics to as-

Alexa rank of their landing domains.

build up a positive reputation. Similarly, we would not
expect scammers or shady businesses to achieve high
Alexa ranks, which are based on visitor volume.
Figure 6 shows the age of landing domains in our
dataset, based on Whois records. We calculate age rel-
ative to April 5, 2016. We observe that Revcontent’s
advertisers have the youngest domains, while Gravity’s
have the oldest. Note that we do not analyze ZergNet
because all of the ads they serve point back to the
ZergNet homepage, which is simply a launchpad for
third-party, promoted content.
Figure 7 plots the Alexa ranks of landing domains in
our dataset. We observe the same trends as in Fig-
ure 6: Gravity’s advertisers have the highest ranks,
while Revcontent’s have the lowest.
The results in Figures 6 and 7 reveal that Grav-
ity caters to older, more established web properties.
Gravity is owned by AOL, and thus it is not sur-
prising that it tends to advertise well-known, AOL-
owned properties like aol.com and techcrunch.com. In
contrast, Revcontent serves ads for obscure websites
like Buzzfeed-knockoﬀ thebuzzstuﬀ.com. Outbrain and
Taboola fall somewhere in the middle, advertising a
small number of reputable properties and a long tail
of unknown properties.
Ad Content.
Next, we investigate the landing
pages’ content associated with 131K ads in our dataset,
to answer the question what is being advertised? To an-
swer this question, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) [4] to extract topics from our corpus of land-
ing pages. LDA uses statistical sampling to identify k
groups of words that frequently co-occur in documents;
each group represents a coherent topic. In our analysis,
we experimented with 20 ≤ k ≤ 100, but found that
k = 40 produced the most succinct topics.
Table 5 shows the top-10 topics extracted from the
landing pages, sorted by frequency. We observe that
∼20% of all landing pages are about the Mortgage or
Credit Cards topics, epitomized by words like “mort-
gage”, “credit” and “loan”. 19% of landing pages are
listicle-style articles (e.g., “8 Pro-Tips For Improving
Your IMC Review Scores!”). Other frequent topics in-
clude celebrity gossip, “miracle” diets, investment ad-
vice, and penny auctions. Overall, these 10 topics cover
51% of the landing pages in our dataset (note that
some pages may fall under multiple topics, e.g., a lis-
ticle about weight loss).
The results in Table 5 conﬁrm many of the con-
cerns about CRNs that have been identiﬁed in the
press [9, 17, 18]. Speciﬁcally, we observe that many
of the most commonly advertised topics are not “con-
tent”, but commercial oﬀers related to ﬁnancial services,
penny auctions, and medical services. Other topics are
“click-bait” centered around bombastic celebrities (e.g.,
Kardashians).
5. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst evaluation of Con-
tent Recommendation Networks (CRNs). CRNs have
become so ubiquitous that their headlines are clich´es;
indeed, we ﬁnd that CRN widgets are embedded in 23%
of the most popular publishers from Alexa’s “News and
Media” categories.
However, CRNs have also been a source of contro-
versy.
In 2014, Outbrain and Taboola (the leading
CRNs) were told by government regulators and indus-
try trade groups to prominently disclose the presence of
promoted links in their widgets [7,20]. Similarly, CRNs
in general have been repeatedly faulted in the press for
recommending spammy content and scams [9, 17, 18].
Using our dataset, we ﬁnd that these issues have
not been fully rectiﬁed. Only ∼15% of CRN widgets
have headlines stating that content is “sponsored” or
“promoted” (see Table 3), and only two CRNs in our
study (Taboola and Revcontent) consistently include
an informative disclosure in their widgets (see Table 1).
With respect to content quality, we observe that CRNs
continue to serve ads for dubious ﬁnancial services,
celebrity gossip, diet schemes, and penny auctions.
Our ﬁndings point to the need for further intervention
in the CRN market by government regulators and in-
dustry groups. At a minimum, CRNs should conform to
accepted best-practices like the Adchoices program, as
Taboola already does. CRNs could also make progress
towards correcting disclosure problems by making their
widgets more uniform, as Revcontent already does. Fi-
nally, CRNs could remove or restrict publishers’ ability
to customize widget headlines, and enforce clear labels
like “Paid Content”. We reached out to the ﬁve compa-
nies examined in this study via their public press con-
tacts, but none responded to our inquiries.
