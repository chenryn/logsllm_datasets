### Unique Ad URLs and Parameters

The statistic indicating that 100% of ad URLs are unique is somewhat misleading. Many ad URLs include unique IDs in their parameters, which we suspect are used by publishers for conversion tracking and A/B testing. When we filter out these URL parameters, the percentage of unique ads drops to 85%, as shown by the "No URL Params" line in Figure 5.

### Aggregation Based on Domain Names

Next, we aggregate ads based on the domain name they point to. The "Ad Domains" line in Figure 5 plots the distribution of publishers per advertised domain. Unlike ad URLs, 50% of advertised domains appear on at least five publishers. Our dataset includes 2,689 unique advertised domains, providing a rough lower bound on the number of advertisers using the five target Content Recommendation Networks (CRNs) between February 26 and March 4, 2016. This finding suggests that the predominant strategy used by advertisers on CRNs is to flood them with many unique ads.

### Redirected Sites and Ad Domains

| Number of Publishers | ≥ 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
|----------------------|-----|---|---|---|---|
| Number of Ad Domains | 42  | 51 | 97 | 193 | 466 |

Table 4: Number of advertised domains that always redirect to other sites.

As shown in Table 2, 79% of advertised domains only appear in widgets from a single CRN. We observed only eight advertisers leveraging four CRNs, indicating that advertisers prefer to work with a single platform to distribute their ads.

### Redirection Analysis

Just because an ad links to a domain does not mean it is the final destination; the domain may redirect the user to another site. To investigate the landing domains, we crawled all 131,000 ads in our dataset using a highly instrumented browser that records all information about redirects, even those initiated by JavaScript or Flash [1].

When visiting the ad URLs, we bypass the initial redirect through the CRN, meaning the advertiser will not be billed by the CRN for our impressions. We avoid visiting the CRNs due to a quirk in their implementations. All five CRNs embed advertisers' URLs into their HTML but dynamically replace the URL with a link pointing to the CRN when a user clicks the link. In our case, we do not click on the advertiser URLs, thus never triggering the dynamic redirects. Instead, we extract the advertiser URLs from the HTML and visit them separately using our instrumented browser.

The "Landing Domains" line in Figure 5 plots the distribution of publishers per landing domain. Surprisingly, we see an increase in the number of unique landing domains compared to ad domains (from 25% to 30%). This reveals that some ad domains redirect users to other sites. Table 4 shows that there are 466 ad domains that always redirect to a specific landing domain, while 383 ad domains redirect to more than one landing domain. The ad domain with the widest fanout in our dataset is DoubleClick, which redirected to 93 different landing domains.

### Advertisers and Content Quality

#### Advertiser Quality

We use two metrics to assess the "quality" of advertisers on CRNs: the age and Alexa rank of their landing domains. Intuitively, recently registered domains have not had time to build a positive reputation, and scammers or shady businesses are unlikely to achieve high Alexa ranks, which are based on visitor volume.

Figure 6 shows the age of landing domains in our dataset, calculated relative to April 5, 2016. Revcontent's advertisers have the youngest domains, while Gravity's have the oldest. Note that we do not analyze ZergNet because all of the ads they serve point back to the ZergNet homepage, which is simply a launchpad for third-party, promoted content.

Figure 7 plots the Alexa ranks of landing domains in our dataset. We observe the same trends: Gravity's advertisers have the highest ranks, while Revcontent's have the lowest. These results reveal that Gravity caters to older, more established web properties. Gravity is owned by AOL, so it is not surprising that it tends to advertise well-known, AOL-owned properties like aol.com and techcrunch.com. In contrast, Revcontent serves ads for obscure websites like thebuzzstuﬀ.com, a Buzzfeed knockoff. Outbrain and Taboola fall somewhere in the middle, advertising a small number of reputable properties and a long tail of unknown properties.

#### Ad Content

Next, we investigate the content of the landing pages associated with 131,000 ads in our dataset to answer the question: what is being advertised? We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [4] to extract topics from our corpus of landing pages. LDA uses statistical sampling to identify k groups of words that frequently co-occur in documents; each group represents a coherent topic. In our analysis, we experimented with 20 ≤ k ≤ 100 but found that k = 40 produced the most succinct topics.

| Topic             | Example Keywords              | % of Landing Pages |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Listicles         | improve, scams, experience    | 18.46%             |
| Credit Cards      | credit, card, interest        | 16.09%             |
| Celebrity Gossip  | Kardashians, sexiest, caught  | 10.94%             |
| Mortgages         | mortgage, HARP, loan          | 8.76%              |
| Solar Panels      | solar, energy, panel           | 6.29%              |
| Movies            | Hollywood, Batman, Marvel     | 5.90%              |
| Health & Diet     | diabetes, fat, stomach        | 5.62%              |
| Investment        | Dow, dividend, stocks         | 1.57%              |
| Keurig            | coffee, Keurig, taste         | 1.21%              |
| Penny Auctions    | auction, bid, pennies         | 1.15%              |

Table 5: Top-10 most frequent topics extracted from landing pages.

Approximately 20% of all landing pages are about mortgages or credit cards, epitomized by words like "mortgage," "credit," and "loan." 19% of landing pages are listicle-style articles (e.g., "8 Pro-Tips For Improving Your IMC Review Scores!"). Other frequent topics include celebrity gossip, "miracle" diets, investment advice, and penny auctions. Overall, these 10 topics cover 51% of the landing pages in our dataset (note that some pages may fall under multiple topics, e.g., a listicle about weight loss).

These results confirm many of the concerns about CRNs identified in the press [9, 17, 18]. Specifically, we observe that many of the most commonly advertised topics are not "content" but commercial offers related to financial services, penny auctions, and medical services. Other topics are "click-bait" centered around bombastic celebrities (e.g., Kardashians).

### Concluding Discussion

In this paper, we present the first evaluation of Content Recommendation Networks (CRNs). CRNs have become so ubiquitous that their headlines are clichés; indeed, we find that CRN widgets are embedded in 23% of the most popular publishers from Alexa's "News and Media" categories.

However, CRNs have also been a source of controversy. In 2014, Outbrain and Taboola (the leading CRNs) were told by government regulators and industry trade groups to prominently disclose the presence of promoted links in their widgets [7, 20]. Similarly, CRNs in general have been repeatedly faulted in the press for recommending spammy content and scams [9, 17, 18].

Using our dataset, we find that these issues have not been fully rectified. Only about 15% of CRN widgets have headlines stating that content is "sponsored" or "promoted" (see Table 3), and only two CRNs in our study (Taboola and Revcontent) consistently include an informative disclosure in their widgets (see Table 1). With respect to content quality, we observe that CRNs continue to serve ads for dubious financial services, celebrity gossip, diet schemes, and penny auctions.

Our findings point to the need for further intervention in the CRN market by government regulators and industry groups. At a minimum, CRNs should conform to accepted best practices like the Adchoices program, as Taboola already does. CRNs could also make progress towards correcting disclosure problems by making their widgets more uniform, as Revcontent already does. Finally, CRNs could remove or restrict publishers' ability to customize widget headlines and enforce clear labels like "Paid Content." We reached out to the five companies examined in this study via their public press contacts, but none responded to our inquiries.
