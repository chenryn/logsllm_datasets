however,  as  indicative  of  these  states,  the  policies  of  Israel,  India  and
Pakistan  will be  described.
It  is  widely  assumed  that  Israel  has  developed  nuclear  weapons;  the
uncertainties  concern  how many  nuclear  weapons  Israel  has  and  whether
they  are  kept  fully  assembled  or  'screw  ready',  i.e.,  in  a  condition  to  be
assembled  in  a  short  period  of  time.  Until  recently,  the  most  commonly
cited estimate was that Israel had approximately 20 nuclear weapons, each
with  a  yield  in  the  20-kiIoton  range.42  Based  on  disclosures  by  Mordechi
Vanunu,  a  former  technician  in  Israel's  Dimona  nuclear  facility,  The
Sunday  Times  concluded  that  Israel  has  'at  least  100 and  as many  as 200
nuclear  weapons  of  varying  destructive  power'.43
The  authority  to  release  nuclear weapons  rests with  the Prime  Minister
of  Israel.  According  to  a  Time  magazine  special  report  of  12 April  1976,
Prime  Minister  Golda  Meir  believed  that  Israel  might  have  to  use  its
nuclear  weapons  during  the  Yom  Kippur  War  of  October  1973 and  gave
the  order  to  assemble  the  weapons.  According  to  the  Time  report,
Defence  Minister Moshe Dayan warned Mrs Meir that Israel was losing on
both the northern  and southern fronts.  Faced with this dire situation,  'Mrs
Meir  thereupon  gave  Dayan  permission  to  activate  Israel's  Doomsday
weapons.  As  each  bomb  was  assembled,  it  was  rushed  off  to  waiting  air
force  units.  Before  any  triggers  were  set,  however,  the  battle  on  both
fronts  turned  in Israel's favour.'45  In  1974, Ephraim  Katz, the former  Israeli
President  and  former  head  scientific  adviser  to  the  Defence  Ministry,
stated  that  Israel  had  the  potential  to acquire  nuclear  weapons  'in  a  short
time -  even  a  few  days.  If  we  should  have  need  of  such  arms,  we  would
have  them.'46
These incidents, as well as other published  accounts, suggest that  Israeli
nuclear weapons are kept partially dismantled.47 If this is actually the case,
this  procedure  constitutes  a  functional  equivalent  of  a  permissive  action
link.
Given  the  technological  development  of  Israeli  science,  the  amount  of
technology  and scientific  knowledge  transferred  from  the  US to Israel  and
the  simplicity  of  basic  PAL designs,  it  would  seem  that  Israel  has  the
capability  to  design  and  install  PAL on  its nuclear  weapons  if it chooses  to
do  so.  Given  the  volatility  of  the  Middle  East,  the  development  and
232

step to insure authorized  control over these weapons. Short of  developing
and installing  PAL, a policy of keeping the weapons disassembled  provides
some  assurance  against  unauthorized  use.
In  May  1974,  India  exploded  its  first  atomic  device  in  the  Rajasthan
desert,  thereby  becoming  the first country  since  the  People's  Republic of
China to detonate a nuclear device. The decision to go ahead with this test
was  probably  made  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Indo-Pakistani  war  of
December  1971.48
The  supreme  political  authority  in  India  rests with  the  Prime  Minister,
and  it  appears  that  Prime  Minister  Indira  Gandhi  was  the  Indian  leader
who decided to go ahead with the 'peaceful  nuclear test explosion' of May
1974.  In  turn,  were  India  to  develop  nuclear  weapons,  it  would  be  the
Prime  Minister  who  would  be  in  the  position  to  make  such  a  decision.
The  consensus  of  most  experts  is  that  India  did  not  proceed  with  the
development  of nuclear weapons following  its 1974 test.  However,  there
have  been  recent  indicators  that  India  may  be  reconsidering  its  policy
against  developing  nuclear  weapons.  For  example,  Rajiv  Gandhi  has
expressed  his  concern  that  Pakistan  is  developing  nuclear  weapons,  and
that  if this were  the  case India  would  be  forced  to  respond  in  kind.  In  an
interview  in  Le  Monde  in  June  1985, Gandhi  was  asked,  'Do  you  think
Pakistan  already has nuclear weapons?  If so, what will be your response?'
Gandhi  responded:
Yes,  we  think  that  they  are  very  close  to  having  one  .  .  . We,  for  our
part, have not yet taken any decision. But we are thinking about it. You
must  understand  that  for  India  it is very worrying that  Pakistan  should
have a nuclear weapon. Islamaliad has already  attacked  us three times.
The fact  that they had the bomb would therefore  change all the rules of
the  game.  We  must  think  about  this  seriously.50
Gandhi went on to imply that India had already developed the necessary
components  to  build  nuclear  weapons:
In principle  we  are  opposed  to  the  idea  of  becoming  a nuclear  power.
We could have done so for  the past  10 or  11 years, but we have not.  //
we decided to become  a nuclear power,  it would take a few  weeks or a few
months.
Question: Are  you  contemplating  this?
Gandhi: Not  yet  . ..
Question: Will you or will you not take the decision  to produce  nuclear
weapons?
Gandhi:  We  have  not  yet  reached  a  decision,  but  we  have  already
worked  on  it.51
Two months following  this interview, the Dhruva research  reactor came
on-line. This reactor is one of the  largest civilian non-power reactors in the
world  and  gives  India  the  ability  to  produce  plutonium  from  domestic
233
Downloaded by [Simon Fraser University] at 00:18 16 March 2015 technology  and  fuel.  Importantly,  this  reactor  is  not  covered  by  Inter-
national  Atomic  Energy  Agency  safeguards  so  it  provides  a  potential
significant  source  of  nuclear  weapons  material  free  from  all  proliferation
controls.52  This  may  constitute  a  warning  to  Pakistan  that  India  could
prevail  in  any  Indo-Pakistani  arms  race.
Pakistan has followed  a two-track  policy concerning the development of
nuclear  weapons:  on  the  public level,  Pakistani  officials  have  vehemently
denied  that  their  country  is  attempting  to  develop  nuclear  weapons.
Beneath  this  public  veneer,  however,  Pakistan  has  been  actively  (but
secretly) working to develop nuclear weapons and has been given financial
assistance  by  Libya  and  technical  aid  by  China.53  According  to  prolifer-
ation  expert  Leonard  Spector,  in  1986  'Pakistan  effectively  crossed  the
nuclear  weapon  threshold  for  the  first  time  in  the  limited  sense  of  being
able  to  fabricate  all of  the  key  components  for  a  nuclear  device'.54
If  India  and  Pakistan  develop  nuclear  weapons,  the  danger  of  nuclear
war  will  be  significantly  increased.  Ideally  from  the  standpoint  of  the
international  community,  neither  India  nor  Pakistan  would  develop
nuclear  weapons.  If  they  do,  what  can  be  done  to  reduce  the  danger  of
nuclear  war?
Conclusion
Permissive  action  links  were  developed  and  deployed  on  many  nuclear
weapons  by  the  United  States  in  the  early  1960s  as  a  means  to  assure
positive control  over them  and  to thereby  reduce  the danger of  accidental
or  unauthorized  detonation.  The  United  States  provided  information
about  PAL to  Britain  and  the  Soviet  Union  during  the  early  1960s
apparently on the assumption  that the world would be a safer place if allies
as  well  as  adversaries  of  the  US  had  secure  control  over  their  nuclear
weapons.  The  evidence  presented  in this  article  indicates  that  the  United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain  and France have  PAL on  at least some of
their  nuclear  weapons,  and  China  and  Israel  do  not.  Furthermore,  it
appears  that  neither  India  nor  Pakistan  have  nuclear  weapons  at  the
present  time.  This  being  the  case,  it  is most  unlikely  that  either  India  or
Pakistan  have  developed  PAL.
Arms control  may be defined  as any action  that reduces the risk or  cost
of war or the preparations for war.  Given this definition,  the  development
and deployment of permissive action links by the United States in the early
1960s  contributed  to  arms  control  by  reducing  the  risk  of  accidental  or
unauthorized  detonation of American nuclear weapons. The United  States
unilaterally  provided  information  about  PAL to  Britain  and  the  Soviet
Union.  What  else  could  be  done  with  PAL  to  contribute  to  lessening  the
dangers  of  nuclear  war?
First, the  United  States could  install  PAL on  all of  its nuclear  weapons.
As noted previously in this article, nuclear weapons aboard US Navy ships
and  submarines  are  not  deployed  with  PAL.  A  recent  report  warned  that
'Navy tactical weapons are vulnerable  to use by terrorists if seized'.55  The
best  way  to  reduce  this danger  is to  install  PAL on  these  weapons.
234

concerning  their  respective  safety,  security  and  storage  (S  )  procedures.
The US attempted  to do this at the  negotiations  that led to the  'Accidents
Measures' Agreement  of  1971, but  the Soviet  Union was not  interested  at
that  time.56 With  the  accession'of  Mikhail  Gorbachev  and  Soviet  concern
following  the  Chernobyl  disaster,  attitudes  there  may  have  changed.
Third,  the  United  States  either  alone  or  in  concert  with  one  or  more
other nuclear weapons states could provide information  about  PAL to other
countries.  It  is  easy  to  think  of  scenarios  in  which  a  crisis  confrontation
between  two  or  more  countries  could  escalate  to  the  point  where  one  or
more  states  would  consider  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons.  A  Sino-Soviet
crisis  similar  to  the  March  1969  confrontation  would  be  such  a  case.
Particularly worrisome in the contemporary  setting would be a major  con-
frontation  between  India  and  Pakistan.  As the  evidence  in this article  and
elsewhere  demonstrates,  both  India  and  Pakistan  are  very  close  to  being
able to build nuclear  weapons and,  if their security were  threatened,  both
countries  could  move  ahead  as quickly  as possible  to  build  them.  Such  a
situation  would  be  extremely  dangerous: both  sides would  likely  consider
pre-emptive attack; a minor incident along the Indo-Pakistani border could
catalyse  a  war  between  the  two  countries;  a  local  military  commander
acting  on  his  own  could  order  the  use  of  nuclear  weapons,  and  so on.  If
India  and  Pakistan  had  permissive  action  links  on  their  nuclear  weapons
and  both  sides knew  that this  was the case, the  danger  would  be  lessened.
To be sure, the danger would  not be eliminated, but it would  significantly
reduce the dangers inherent in the escalation of a crisis. The Middle East is
another region of the world in which the possession  of  PAL by the  relevant
actors  could  incrementally  reduce  the  dangers  of  escalation.
The  United  States  either  acting  unilaterally  or  in  concert  with  one  or
more  other  states  that  currently  have  PAL,  could  provide  information  on
them to states that request such information.  Of course, neither the United
States  nor  any  other  country  would  provide  information  on  its  currently
deployed  PAL; however,  the  US  could  release  information  about  its
earlier  PAL,  and  the  country  requesting  the  information  could  then  work
to  improve  on  the  basic  design.  As  the  United  States  has  unilaterally
provided  information  about  PAL to  Britain  and  the  Soviet  Union  in  the
past, it is possible that US government officials  would be willing to provide
this information  to  other  countries  as a unilateral  initiative.
What  are  the  advantages  of  this proposal?  If  all of  the countries in  the
world that have or are suspected of having nuclear weapons had permissive
action links on their nuclear weapons, the danger of nuclear war would  be
lessened.  This  is  particularly  true  of  crisis-prone  areas  of  the  world.  In
addition,  PAL reduce  the risk of  accidental  or unauthorized  use of  nuclear
weapons  by  subnational  or  terrorist  groups.  Lastly,  to  the  leaders  of
governments  that  have  not  always  been  characterized  by  stability, PAL
present  a means to insure that  nuclear weapons can only be used with  the
authorization  of  the central  command  authority,  and  not  some  disaffected
military  officer.

providing  information  about  PAL to  other  countries.  The  most  serious
objection  to this proposal is that it could  encourage  potential  proliferators
to go ahead and develop nuclear weapons. For example, if the US were to
offer  PAL to Pakistan, the Pakistani government  could very easily interpret
this  offer  as de facto  US  recognition  and  encouragement  of  the  Pakistani
nuclear  weapons  programme.  There  is  no  shortage  of  hostility  and
suspicion  towards  the  United  States  by  many  in  developing  states,  and
potential  recipient  countries might  object  to receiving information  and/or
PAL  techology  on  the  grounds  that  it  would  result  in  US  control  of  their
nuclear  weapons;  that  the  PAL could  somehow  be  manipulated  by  the
United  States.  Lastly,  if  the  US  provided  information  about  basic PAL
designs, US nuclear  weapons  security  could  be compromised.  This  would
not occur, however, if the US only provided information  about  the  earlier
American  PAL.
American  nuclear weapons  that  are  designed  and  built  with  an  integral
permissive  action  link  are  virtually  immune  to accidental  or  unauthorized
detonation.  But  not  all nuclear  weapons  have  PAL,  including  some  in  the
US  arsenal  such  as  nuclear  weapons  on  US  naval  vessels.  And  some
countries  -  China  and  the  'candidate  members'  of  the  nuclear  weapons
club -  do not have  PAL on any of their nuclear weapons. The United  States
should  give  serious  and  systematic  consideration  to  the  possibility  of
providing  information  on  PAL  to  countries  that  request  it.  Providing PAL
information  to other countries could prove to be a small but significant  step
towards  reducing  the risk  of  nuclear  war.
