### Appendix

#### A. Test Compositions

In this section, we detail the various test compositions integrated into our framework. These compositions are summarized in Table 5, along with the associated domains.

#### B. Extension Set Population

This section presents the extension set populations. For ad tracking protection extensions, these are listed in Table 6, and for ad blocking extensions in Table 7. All extensions for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox were selected based on relevant search criteria and a minimum number of users or downloads (whichever was available). Due to the unavailability of both numbers for Edge extensions, we selected Edge extensions based on the popularity of their counterparts for the other browsers. The extension "AdBlocker Lite" is listed twice in Tables 2 and 7 because we tested its two modes.

#### C. Bug Reports and Responses

In this section, we address the bug reports that we filed and their subsequent responses. Bugs were reported to both browsers (Section C.1) and extensions (Section C.2). To avoid inspiring attackers or trackers, we decided to file private bug reports. Note that some bug threads may still be private when visiting the associated links.

##### C.1 Built-in Browser Protection
- **[bug1]** The bug that can be leveraged to bypass Chrome’s and Opera’s third-party cookie policy has been confirmed and is scheduled to be fixed. [Link](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=836746)
- **[bug2]** We reported that Safari 10 does not block all third-party cookies when this option is enabled. This bug has not yet been confirmed. [Link](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=186589)
- **[bug3]** The bug that nullifies Edge’s option to block third-party cookies has been confirmed. [Link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/16512847)
- **[bug4]** The bypasses for Opera’s ad blocker have been reported, but we were given an email address to inquire about the process.
- **[bug5]** In the bug thread for Firefox's tracking protection, references were made to previously reported similar bugs related to Firefox’s Safe Browsing feature. Although the bug has not yet been officially flagged as confirmed, there is an intention to fix it. [Link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447935)

##### C.2 Extensions
- **[bug6]** This bug permitted cross-site requests initiated by JavaScript embedded in a PDF to bypass the WebExtension API in Chromium-based browsers. The bug thread was closed as WontFix because this functionality was working as intended. [Link](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=824705)
- **[bug7]** We reported that requests for fetching favicons and those initiated through the AppCache API are not interceptable through Firefox’s WebExtension API. The bug thread was closed as WontFix. [Link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1447933)
- **[bug8]** We identified a wide variety of bugs inherent to the implementation of ad blocking and privacy protection extensions. Only 5 out of 11 contacted extension developers responded, with only 2 proactively fixing the issues.

##### C.3 Same-Site Cookie
- **[bug9]** The prerender bug found in Chrome and Opera has been filed through the Chromium project, where it was confirmed and scheduled to be fixed. [Link](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=709946)
- **[bug10]** We reported several bypasses for Edge’s implementation of the same-site cookie policy. This bug report has been confirmed. [Link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/18054323/)
