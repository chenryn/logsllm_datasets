### 5.3.2 Median and Average Performance Analysis

Using Equation 9, the median result across 20 random instances is shown in Figure 8 (upper). The corresponding Bit Error Rate (BER) as a function of time (i.e., Time-to-BER, TTB) is depicted in Figure 8 (lower). It is important to note that the pausing algorithm outperforms the non-pausing algorithm, regardless of whether the Opt or Fix strategy is used, despite each anneal in the former (Ta + Tp) taking twice as much time as the latter (when Ta = 1 µs). Based on this empirical finding, we will present results in the following section only for the protocol that includes a pause.

### 5.3.3 QuAMax: End-to-End Performance

We now evaluate the TTB and Time-to-FER (TTF) of QuAMax, comparing:

1. **QuAMax**: Fixed-parameter, average-case performance.
2. **Oracle**: Median-case Opt performance, which optimizes QA parameters (§5.3.2: outlier data points have minimal influence on the median order statistic).

Figure 9 illustrates the TTB with varying user numbers and modulations at the edge of QuAMax’s performance capabilities. Solid and dashed lines represent median and mean TTB, respectively. We observe that mean TTB often exceeds median TTB due to a small number of long-running outliers. QuAMax sets a time deadline (measured median TTB for the target BER) for decoding and discards bits after this deadline, relying on forward error correction to reduce BER.

Figure 10 explores TTB for a target BER of \(10^{-6}\), considering instances that reach this BER within 10 ms and average performance. Problems of these sizes are beyond the capability of conventional decoders (cf. Table 1). Opt achieves superior BER within 1–100 µs, while QuAMax achieves an acceptable BER for use below error control coding. Note that instances with TTB below the minimum required time (i.e., Ta + Tp) caused by parallelization require (an amortized) 2 µs.

Next, we consider frame error rate (FER) performance, measuring both mean and median FER achieved by QuAMax. Results in Figure 11 show that tens of microseconds suffice to achieve a low enough (below \(10^{-3}\)) FER to support high throughput communication for 60-user BPSK, 18-user QPSK, or four-user 16-QAM. QuAMax (mean Fix) achieves similar performance with slightly fewer users. Our results also indicate low sensitivity to frame size, ranging from maximal-sized internet data frames (1,500 bytes) to TCP ACK-sized data frames (50 bytes).

### 5.4 Performance under AWGN Noise

We next evaluate the impact of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) from the wireless channel, testing six Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) ranging from 10 dB to 40 dB. To isolate the effect of noise, the results in this subsection fix the channel and transmitted bit-string and consider ten AWGN noise instances.

Figure 12 shows the effect of AWGN channel noise, which is additive to ICE, for six illustrative examples. As SNR increases, the probability of finding the ground state and the relative energy gap tend to increase. At 10 dB SNR, the energy gap between the lowest and second lowest energy solutions narrows to just three percent, leaving minimal room for error.

In terms of overall performance, Figure 13 (left) shows TTB at 20 dB SNR, varying the number of users and modulation. At a fixed SNR, we observe a graceful degradation in TTB as the number of users increases, across all modulations. Figure 13 (right) shows TTB at a certain user number, varying SNR and modulation. At a fixed user number, as SNR increases, performance improves, noting that the idealized median performance of Opt shows little sensitivity to SNR, achieving \(10^{-6}\) BER within 100 µs in all cases.

### 5.5 Trace-Driven Channel Performance

We evaluate system performance with real wideband MIMO channel traces at 2.4 GHz, between 96 base station antennas and eight static users [61]. This dataset comprises the largest MIMO trace size currently available. For each channel use, we randomly pick eight base station antennas to evaluate the 8 × 8 MIMO channel use at SNR ca. 25–35 dB. Figure 15 shows the resulting TTB and TTF. We achieve \(10^{-6}\) BER and \(10^{-4}\) FER within 10 µs for QPSK. For BPSK, considering multiple problem instances operating in parallel, we achieve the same BER and FER within (an amortized) 2 µs period. This implies that tens of microseconds suffice to achieve a low BER and FER even without parallelization of identical problems, creating an opportunity for QuAMax to parallelize different problems (e.g., different subcarriers’ ML decoding).

### 6 RELATED WORK

#### Applications of Quantum Annealing (QA)

Despite the immaturity of software toolchains, existing quantum annealing machines have been successfully programmed to solve problems in various fields, including Planning and Scheduling [57], Databases [66], Fault Diagnostics [55], Machine Learning [54], Finance [59], Data Analysis [47], Chemistry [31], and Space Sciences/Aeronautics [3]. A similar problem to ML detection, CDMA multiuser demodulation, was solved using quantum fluctuations controlled by the transverse field (similar to QA) in [53]. Notably, work on optimization of fully-connected graphs, such as those used to map the ML problem [69], showed that QA performance could match the most highly optimized simulated annealing code run on the latest Intel processors. For further details on the logical to physical qubit embedding process, see Venturelli et al. [69]. Efficient embeddings that do not force the chip coverage to be a triangle are also known [7].

#### Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms, invented in 2014 [23], and recently generalized for constrained combinatorial optimization [28], require digital gate-model quantum computing (QC), which became available at a reasonable scale only in 2017 (prototypes from IBM, Rigetti Computing, and Google are available). While QA and QAOA require different hardware (the former is analog, the latter digital), they share commonalities: (1) For problems without hard constraints, the programming step involves defining a classical combinatorial problem cast into QUBO [9, 72] or Ising form, allowing both to leverage our formulation (§3.2). (2) QAOA can be seen as a "digitized" version of QA in some parameter ranges and has been formally demonstrated to simulate and potentially outperform QA [77]. The first commonality is particularly important as it opens the door to applying our techniques on future hardware capable of running QAOA.

#### Conventional Maximum Likelihood (ML) Detectors

Faster silicon-based ML detector strategies typically approximate and parallelize the ML computation [15, 73]. Significant progress has been made in this direction, with Sphere Decoders realized in ASIC hardware [10, 74]. However, these fall short when more antennas are needed at the Access Point (AP) to serve more users or when higher-order modulations are used [32, 76].

### 7 DISCUSSION

#### Current Status and Practical Considerations

- **Computational Power Consumption**: Computation in the DWQ2 is performed at zero energy consumption, as dictated by reversible computing, although energy is dissipated during initialization and readout. The DW2Q draws 16 kW of power, primarily used by the cryogenic refrigeration unit [17]. The computational power (per watt) for quantum processing units (QPUs) is expected to increase more rapidly than for conventional platforms, as the DW2Q power draw is not expected to change significantly with growing qubit and coupler counts, while computational power substantially increases.
  
- **Operating Expenses**: Operating the DW2Q incurs significant electricity costs, and the dilution refrigerator requires liquid nitrogen 1-2 times a month, totaling about USD $17,000 annually.
  
- **Processing Times**: In the envisioned centralized RAN architecture, a QPU co-located with centralized RAN computational resources in a data center is connected to APs via high-speed fiber or millimeter-wave links. The latency between APs and the data center is not significant. However, QuAMax cannot be deployed today due to additional processing times in the current QPU, including approximately 30-50 ms preprocessing time, 6-8 ms programming time, and 0.125 ms readout time per anneal. These overheads exceed the processing time available for wireless technologies (at most 3–10 ms). These overhead times are not fundamental and can be reduced by several orders of magnitude through system integration. Advances in superconducting qubit technology are expected to make QuAMax viable within a decade. Additionally, QuAMax’s Ising form (in Section 3.2.2) can be adapted to run on emerging physics-based optimization devices based on photonic technologies [29], which have inherently faster processing times. Therefore, an end-to-end evaluation in a fully centralized RAN architecture with more advanced hardware is left as future work.

### 8 CONCLUSION

QuAMax is the first design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of a quantum-computing solver for the computationally challenging ML MIMO decoding problem. Our performance results establish a baseline for future fully-integrated systems in the context of the centralized RAN architecture. We show that once engineering efforts optimize the integration between quantum and conventional computation, quantum computation should be considered a competitive technology for the future design of high-capacity wireless networks.

**Future Work**:
- Further optimization of |JF|, Ta, and sp, as well as new QA techniques like reverse annealing [68], may close the gap to Opt performance.
- Expected changes in QA architecture, featuring qubits with 2× the degree of Chimera, 2× the number of qubits, and longer-range couplings, may permit ML problems of size, e.g., 175 × 175 for QPSK, and dramatically increase the parallelization opportunity of the chip due to reduced embedding overhead.
- We will benefit from QA technology improvements from the international community manufacturing quantum annealers with advanced capabilities. According to the development roadmap, in about a decade, a system like QuAMax could be based on chips with tens of thousands of highly-connected qubits, with annealing schedules capable of more advanced quantum effects (e.g., non-stoquasticity [51]). Engineering advances will also significantly reduce overhead operation times. While quantum annealers are ahead in terms of qubit count, gate-model systems offer additional controls that may increase performance in the future. We will investigate MIMO ML decoding on gate-model QPUs in future work, which currently cannot support algorithms that decode more than 4×4 BPSK.
