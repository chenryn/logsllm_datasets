estimation  of the autoregressive power  spectral density  using 
Burg's method [32]. For each estimated spectrum 6 frequency 
bands were analyzed. Firstly, the classic HRV frequency bands 
were analyzed: 1) aVLF -  area of the spectra in the very low 
frequency (VLF) band (0-0.04 Hz); 2) aLF - area of the spectra 
in the low frequency (LF) band (0.04-0.15 Hz) and; 3) aHF â€“
area of the spectra in the high frequency (HF) band (0.15-0.4 
Hz).  Secondly,  aiming  to  investigate  the  influence  in  higher 
frequency bands, the area of the spectra was also accessed in: 1) 
0.4-1.6 Hz frequency band (aVHF[0.4-1.6]); 2) 1.6-5 Hz frequency 
band  (aVHF[1.6-5])  and;  5-10  Hz  frequency  band  (aVHF[5-10]). 
While,  in  the  classic  HRV  analysis  the  HF  component  is 
commonly accepted as a marker of parasympathetic activity, the 
LF  component  is  considered  as  a  primary  indicator  of 
sympathetic  modulation  [31],  in  the  analysis  of  PD  data  the 
choice  of 
their  physiological 
interpretation are still vague. 
1) Data normalization 
Due  to  the  wide  inter-subject  changes  in  the  frequency 
contributions observed in previous studies [33], the PD signal 
was normalized in each trial according to the median (or mean) 
of  the  respective  index  in  the  resting  phase  (step  2  of  the 
protocol)).  The  choice  of  the  statistical  operator  during  this 
phase was performed according to the result of the one-sample 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The spectral components of the signals of 30 volunteers were 
extracted and analyzed according to the methodology proposed 
in steps 2 and 4  of the previously defined protocol, leading to 
the definition of 8 major groups of data shown in Table II.  
In order to visualize the distribution of data values within 
each defined group, to compare it with the adjacent groups and 
with the remaining analyzed frequency bands and improve the 
interpretation of the extracted data, an exploratory data analysis 
was  conducted  resorting  to  box  plot  analysis.  Using  this 
technique it is possible to access the amount of dispersion, and 
its asymmetry as well as the outliers. 
Figure 1 presents the boxplots for the analyzed frequency 
bands in  each of  the  predefined  data  groups  representing the 
global view (in a range of 0 to 25 n.u.), while Figure 2 shows the 
boxplots in a closer view in the range [0 to 2.75] n.u.

In Figure 2 there is a clear distinction between REST group 
and CODE groups, having the CODE groups median values of 
the normalized PSD area below 0.923, within the frequencies 
from 0 to 0.4 Hz. From the analysis of the REST group in each 
of the frequency bands, it is possible to observe that the largest 
variance is presented in the VLF band (0 to 0.04 Hz). It is also 
possible to observe that the variance decreases from VLF band 
( % 
 )    to  VHF[5-10]  ( % 	 )  and  a  similar 
trend is also observed for the outliers and whiskers.

   Figure 1 - Boxplot analysis of the frequency bands from 0 to 10 Hz 
The analysis of the CODE group shows a similar dispersion 
in the VLF and LF bands, while the median value remains below 
the baseline from VLF to HF bands. From VHF[0.4-1.6] to VHF[5-
10] we can see the median value remain almost unchanged above 
the  baseline,  followed  by  a  decrease  in  the  dispersion  of  the 
values.  The  outliers  and  whiskers  follow  a  similar  trend, 
decreasing from LF to VHF[5-10].

    Figure 2 â€“ Closer view of the boxplot analysis in in the range [0 to 2.75] n.u. 
From  the  analysis  of  the  symmetry  of  the  distributions 
corresponding to the REST and CODE data groups, it is possible 
to  observe  that  while  the  values  in  the  REST  group  remain 
symmetric around the median value, in the CODE group there 
is a positive skewness, presenting a tail on the right side of the 
distributions,  denotating  the  presence  of  more  values  largely 
above the median. 
This separation is not so clear in the frequencies above 0.4 
Hz, although it is more evident the increase of the median values 
of  the  normalized  PSD  area  with  the  increase  of  the  code 
complexity, especially in the 5-10 Hz frequency range 
It is also possible to observe a larger dispersion of the values 
in CODE groups (represented by larger IQRs and the number of 
outliers above the baseline) when compared to the REST groups 
(small  IQRs  and  low  number  of  outliers).  This  observations 
becomes  even  more  evident  from  HF  to  VHF[1.6-5] 
where  there  is  an  increase  in  the  gap  between  these 
groups  considering 
these  characteristics,  which 
suggests a higher (although sporadic) activation of the 
parasympathetic  pathways  during the  analysis  of the 
code snippets. This is a clear indication of the mental 
load of  participants in the different  steps,  showing a 
clear difference between CODE and REST and among 
the different codes. 
Comparing the evolution of the distributions within 
the CODE groups in Figure 2, it is possible to perceive 
an increase in the median values of the LF to VHF[5-10], 
from  CODE  1  to  CODE  3.  This  trend  is  more 
noticeable in the frequency band VHF[0.4-1.6]. While in 
the HF and HF bands the median values remain below 
the baseline, in the VHF[0.4-1.6], VHF[1.6-5] and VHF[5-10] 
the median values exceed the baseline. It is also visible 
that the outliers concentration and range increase from CODE 1 
to CODE 3 in all the frequency bands. The values of the upper 
whiskers follow the same trend all the frequency bands, with 
exception to the VLF band. The increase in the variability of the 
values from CODE 1 to CODE 3 is also marked by the increase 
of the IQRs in the LF, HF and VHF[0.4-1.6] bands. This suggests 
that  the  increase  in  the  cognitive  effort  is  translated  in  an 
increase of the dispersion of the pupil diameter frequency bands 
content and in the increase of the spectral power in 
these bands.  
From these results, it is clear to conclude that the 
extracted indexes reflect the influence caused by the 
cognitive effort in the ANS. This is markedly clear 
in the higher frequency bands, where the separability 
between  the  REST  and  CODE  groups  is  more 
visible,  especially  when  considering  the  lack  of 
overlap  between the distributions corresponding  to 
the  REST  group  and  the  values  above  the  75th 
percentile corresponding to the CODE groups.

when analyzing PD  changes in the context of the present study. 
These  findings  are  in  agreement  with  the  literature  (on 
pupillography use not related to software), where it was reported 
an increase of the power spectra in the high frequency bands as 
a  function of cognitive task  difficulty  [22],  which are  mostly 
associated with the activation of the parasympathetic afferent.  
Globally, the pupillography results in the different frequency 
bands show a clear difference between the REST activities and 
the  CODE  activities,  as  well  as  distinct  pupillography  data 
between  CODE  1  and  the  other  two  codes,  and  also  some 
difference (clear in some bands) between CODE2 and CODE 3.  
An  interesting  aspect  is  to  compare  pupillography  results  
with  the  effort  perceived  by  participants  using  an  adapted 
version of the NASA-TLX survey, as shown in Table III.
