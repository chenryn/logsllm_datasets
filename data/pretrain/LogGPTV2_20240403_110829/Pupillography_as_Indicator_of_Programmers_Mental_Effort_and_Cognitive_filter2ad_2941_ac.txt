### Estimation of the Autoregressive Power Spectral Density Using Burg's Method

The autoregressive power spectral density was estimated using Burg's method [32]. For each estimated spectrum, six frequency bands were analyzed. Initially, the classic HRV (Heart Rate Variability) frequency bands were examined:

1. **aVLF**: Area of the spectra in the very low frequency (VLF) band (0-0.04 Hz).
2. **aLF**: Area of the spectra in the low frequency (LF) band (0.04-0.15 Hz).
3. **aHF**: Area of the spectra in the high frequency (HF) band (0.15-0.4 Hz).

Additionally, to investigate the influence of higher frequency bands, the following areas were also analyzed:
1. **aVHF[0.4-1.6]**: Area of the spectra in the 0.4-1.6 Hz frequency band.
2. **aVHF[1.6-5]**: Area of the spectra in the 1.6-5 Hz frequency band.
3. **aVHF[5-10]**: Area of the spectra in the 5-10 Hz frequency band.

In classical HRV analysis, the HF component is commonly accepted as a marker of parasympathetic activity, while the LF component is considered a primary indicator of sympathetic modulation [31]. However, in the analysis of PD (Pupil Diameter) data, the physiological interpretation of these components remains less clear.

### Data Normalization

Due to the wide inter-subject variability in frequency contributions observed in previous studies [33], the PD signal was normalized in each trial according to the median (or mean) of the respective index during the resting phase (step 2 of the protocol). The choice between median and mean was based on the results of the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

### Data Labels, Descriptions, and Steps in Protocol

| CODE       | Comprehension of code – CODE 1, CODE 2, and CODE 3 | 4 |
| REST1      | Reading of text in natural language before CODE 1 | 2 |
| CODE1      | Comprehension of code – CODE 1 | 4 |
| REST2      | Reading of text in natural language before CODE 2 | 2 |
| CODE2      | Comprehension of code – CODE 2 | 4 |
| REST3      | Reading of text in natural language before CODE 3 | 2 |
| CODE3      | Comprehension of code – CODE 3 | 4 |

### Results and Discussion

The spectral components of signals from 30 volunteers were extracted and analyzed according to the methodology defined in steps 2 and 4 of the protocol, resulting in eight major data groups (Table II). To visualize the distribution of data values within each group, compare them with adjacent groups, and improve the interpretation of the extracted data, an exploratory data analysis using box plots was conducted. This technique allows for the assessment of dispersion, asymmetry, and outliers.

**Figure 1** presents the box plots for the analyzed frequency bands across the predefined data groups, showing a global view (in a range of 0 to 25 n.u.). **Figure 2** provides a closer view in the range [0 to 2.75] n.u.

#### Analysis of Box Plots

In **Figure 2**, there is a clear distinction between the REST and CODE groups. The CODE groups have median values of the normalized PSD area below 0.923 within the frequencies from 0 to 0.4 Hz. In the REST group, the largest variance is observed in the VLF band (0 to 0.04 Hz), and this variance decreases from the VLF band to the VHF[5-10] band. A similar trend is observed for the outliers and whiskers.

The CODE group shows a similar dispersion in the VLF and LF bands, with median values remaining below the baseline from the VLF to the HF bands. From VHF[0.4-1.6] to VHF[5-10], the median values remain almost unchanged above the baseline, followed by a decrease in the dispersion of values. The outliers and whiskers follow a similar trend, decreasing from the LF to the VHF[5-10] bands.

#### Symmetry of Distributions

The symmetry of the distributions for the REST and CODE data groups reveals that the values in the REST group remain symmetric around the median value. In contrast, the CODE group exhibits positive skewness, with a tail on the right side of the distributions, indicating more values significantly above the median.

This separation is less clear in frequencies above 0.4 Hz, but it is evident that the median values of the normalized PSD area increase with the complexity of the code, especially in the 5-10 Hz frequency range. The CODE groups show larger IQRs and a higher number of outliers above the baseline compared to the REST groups, which have smaller IQRs and fewer outliers. This observation becomes more pronounced from the HF to the VHF[1.6-5] bands, suggesting sporadic activation of parasympathetic pathways during code analysis.

#### Comparison of CODE Groups

Comparing the evolution of the distributions within the CODE groups in **Figure 2**, there is an increase in the median values from the LF to the VHF[5-10] bands, from CODE 1 to CODE 3. This trend is most noticeable in the VHF[0.4-1.6] band. While the median values in the HF and VHF[0.4-1.6] bands remain below the baseline, they exceed the baseline in the VHF[0.4-1.6], VHF[1.6-5], and VHF[5-10] bands. The concentration and range of outliers also increase from CODE 1 to CODE 3 in all frequency bands, with the upper whiskers following the same trend, except in the VLF band.

The increase in cognitive effort is reflected in the increased dispersion of the pupil diameter frequency bands content and the increased spectral power in these bands. The extracted indexes clearly reflect the influence of cognitive effort on the ANS, particularly in the higher frequency bands, where the separability between the REST and CODE groups is more visible.

#### Conclusion

The results indicate that the increase in cognitive effort required for comprehending CODE, whose complexity increases from CODE 1 to CODE 3, is reflected in the maximum outliers' concentration and range in almost all frequency bands. The increase in median values, especially in the HF and VHF[0.4-1.6] bands, suggests that the activity of the ANS can be better captured in higher frequency bands rather than the classic HRV ones when analyzing PD changes in this context. These findings align with the literature, where an increase in power spectra in high-frequency bands is associated with the activation of parasympathetic afferents during cognitive tasks [22].

Globally, the pupillography results in different frequency bands show a clear difference between REST activities and CODE activities, as well as distinct pupillography data between CODE 1 and the other two codes, and some differences between CODE 2 and CODE 3. Comparing pupillography results with the perceived effort using an adapted version of the NASA-TLX survey (Table III) provides further insights into the participants' mental load.

In the survey (step 6 of the protocol), each participant was first asked to describe the algorithm of each code (C1 to C3) to assess their understanding of each program.
