ABSTRACT
In this paper, we present the notion and construction of
threshold ring signature without random oracles. This is
the (cid:12)rst scheme in the literature that is proven secure in the
standard model. Our scheme extends the Shacham-Waters
signature from PKC 2007 in a non-trivial way. We note that
our technique is speci(cid:12)cally designed to achieve a thresh-
old ring signature in the standard model. Interestingly, we
can still maintain the signature size to be the same as the
Shacham-Waters signature, while only a tiny computation
cost is added.

INTRODUCTION
Ring Signature. A ring signature scheme (such as [24,
1, 32, 6, 30, 19, 16]) allows members of a group to sign mes-
sages on behalf of the group without the need to reveal their
identities, i.e., providing signer anonymity. Additionally, it
is not possible to decide whether two signatures have been
issued by the same group member. Di(cid:11)erent from a group
signature scheme (such as [13, 9, 3]), the group formation
is spontaneous and there exists no group manager to revoke

the identity of the signer. That is, under the assumption
that each user is already associated with a public key of
some standard signature scheme, a user can form a group
by simply collecting the public keys of all the group mem-
bers including his own. These diversion group members can
be totally unaware of being conscripted into the group.
Ring signature schemes could be used for whistle blow-
ing [24], anonymous membership authentication for ad hoc
groups [8] and many other applications which do not want
complicated group formation stage but require signer anonymi-
ty. For example, in the whistle blowing scenario, a whistle-
blower gives out a secret as well as a ring signature of the
secret to the public. From the signature, the public can be
sure that the secret is indeed provided by a group member
while they will not be able to (cid:12)gure out who the whistle-
blower is. At the same time, the whistleblower does not need
any collaboration of other users who have been conscripted
by him into the group of members associated with the ring
signature. Hence, the anonymity of the whistleblower is en-
sured and the public is also certain that the secret is indeed
leaked by one of the group members associated with the ring
signature.
Ring signature scheme can be used to derive other primi-
tives as well. It had been utilized to construct non-interactive
deniable ring authentication [27], perfect concurrent signa-
ture [28] and multi-designated veri(cid:12)ers signature [21].
Many reductionist security proofs used the random oracle
model [4]. Several papers proved that some popular cryp-
tosystems previously proved secure in the random oracle are
actually provably insecure when the random oracle is instan-
tiated by any real-world hashing functions [10, 2]. Thus, it is
natural to design a practical ring signature scheme provably
secure without requiring random oracles.
Subsequently, there are some ring signature schemes that
do not rely on random oracles exist in the literature. Xu et
al.
[31] described a ring signature scheme in the standard
model. But the proof is not rigorous and is apparently (cid:13)awed
[5]. Chow et al. [15] gave a ring signature scheme with proof
in the standard model, though it is based on a strong new
assumption. Bender et al. [5] presented a ring signature se-
cure in the standard model assuming trapdoor permutations
exists. Their scheme uses generic ZAPs for NP as a building
261
block, which may not be practical. Shacham and Water-
s [26] proposed an e(cid:14)cient ring signature scheme without
using random oracles, based on standard assumption. They
rely on composite order pairing that results for a trusted set-
up procedure. Very recently, Sch(cid:127)age and Schwenk [25] gave
another ring signature scheme in the standard model using
basic assumption. In contrast to the previous construction,
they used prime order pairing instead. However, their secu-
rity model does not allow the adversary to query any private
key.
All the above mentioned ring signature schemes only allow
one single signer, which is also known as 1-out-of-n ring
signature scheme [1].
Threshold Ring Signature. A (d, n)-threshold ring sig-
nature has the similar notion to the (1-out-of-n) ring sig-
nature. First, a (d, n)-threshold ring signature scheme re-
quires at least t signers to work jointly for generating a sig-
nature. Second, the anonymity of signers is preserved both
inside and outside the signing group. Third, those t par-
ticipating signers can choose any set of n entities including
themselves without getting any consent from those diver-
sion group members. The (cid:12)rst threshold ring signature was
proposed by Bresson et al. [8] in 2002 which is followed by
Wong et al. [30] in 2003. Both of them extend the 1-out-of-n
ring signature from [24] in a di(cid:11)erent way. However, the idea
of proving \Knowing d solutions out of n problem instance"
[17] was proposed in the early 90s. Liu et al. [22] changed
the idea into threshold ring signature for separate key types.
Subsequently, di(cid:11)erent types of setting or construction such
as ID-based [14], certi(cid:12)cateless-based [12], code-based [23,
18] and lattice-based [11] have also been proposed. How-
ever, all previous threshold ring signature schemes in the
literature (regardless the underlying cryptosystem or con-
struction) can be proven secure in the random oracle or ideal
cipher model only1.
1.1 Contribution
In this paper, we propose the (cid:12)rst threshold ring signa-
ture scheme provable secure without random oracles. It is a
threshold extension of the Shacham-Waters (SW) signature
[26]. However, we have to note that the extension is not
trivial. The typical secret sharing technique cannot be used
in the ring signature case. The modi(cid:12)ed polynomial inter-
polation technique (e.g. [17, 22, 29]) requires random oracle
to instantiate a signature scheme. Thus, we emphasize that
our technique is specially designed for non-random oracle
security proof. Additionally, we can still maintain the sig-
nature size to be the same as the SW signature, while only
a tiny computation cost is added.
2. PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Pairings
We make use of bilinear groups of composite order. Let n
be a composite number with factorization n = pq. We have
• G is a multiplicative cyclic groups of order n.
1Although Han et al. [20] claimed their threshold ring sig-
nature scheme is secure in the standard mode, Tsang et al.
[29] showed that their proof is incorrect. We do not regard
[20] as a provable secure scheme.
• Gp is its cyclic order-p subgroup, and Gq is its cyclic
order-q subgroup
• g is a generator of G, while h is a generator of Gq.
• GT is a multiplicative group of order n.
• ^e is a bilinear map such that e : G × G → GT with the
following properties:
{ Bilinearity: For all u, v ∈ G, and a, b ∈ Z,
^e(ua, vb) = ^e(u, v)ab.
{ Non-degeneracy: ⟨^e(g, g)⟩ = GT whenever ⟨g⟩ =
G.
for all u, v ∈ G.
{ Computability: It is e(cid:14)cient to compute ^e(u, v)
• GT;p and GT;q are the GT -subgroups of order p and q,
respectively.
• The group operations on G and GT can be performed
e(cid:14)ciently.
• Bit strings corresponding to elements of G and of GT
can be recognized e(cid:14)ciently.
2.2 Mathematical Assumptions
Definition 1
For our scheme, we assume two problems are di(cid:14)cult to
solve in the setting described above: computational Di(cid:14)e-
Hellman in Gp and the Subgroup Decision Problem.
Given the tuple (r, ra, rb), where r ∈R Gp, and a, b ∈R Zp,
compute and output rab.
In the composite setting one is
additionally given the description of the larger group G, in-
cluding the factorization (p, q) of its order n.
(Computational Diffie-Hellman in Gp).
Definition 2
(Subgroup Decision). Given w select-
ed at random either from G (with probability 1/2) or from
Gq (with probability 1/2), decide whether w is in Gq. For
this problem one is given the description of G, but not given
the factorization of n.
The assumptions are formalized by measuring an adver-
sary’s success probability for computational Di(cid:14)e-Hellman
and an adversary’s guessing advantage for the subgroup de-
cision problem. Note that if CDH in Gp as we have formu-
lated it is hard then so is CDH in G. The assumption that
the subgroup decision problem is hard is called Subgroup
Hiding (SGH) assumption, and was introduced by Boneh et
al [7].
3. SECURITY MODEL
We give our security model and de(cid:12)ne relevant security
notions.
3.1 Syntax of threshold ring signature
A threshold ring signature, (TRS) scheme, is a tuple of
four algorithms (KeyGen, Sign and Verify.
• (ski, pki) ← KeyGen(λ) is a PPT algorithm which,
on input a security parameter λ ∈ N, outputs a pri-
vate/public key pair (ski, pki). We denote by SK and
PK the domains of possible secret keys and public
keys, resp. When we say that a public key correspond-
s to a secret key or vice versa, we mean that the se-
cret/public key pair is an output of KeyGen.

• param ← Setup(λ) is a PPT algorithm which, on in-
put a security parameter λ, outputs the set of security
parameters param which includes λ.

′
a group size n, threshold d ∈ {1, . . . , n}, a set Y of
n public keys in PK, a set X of d private keys whose
corresponding public keys are all contained in Y, and
a message M , produces a signature σ.
• accept/reject ← Verify(n, d,Y, M, σ) which, on input a
group size n, threshold d ∈ {1, . . . , n}, a set Y of n
public keys in PK, a message-signature pair (M ,σ) re-
turns accept or reject. If accept, the message-signature
pair is valid.
3.1.1 Correctness.
TRS schemes must satisfy: Veri(cid:12)cation Correctness. That
is, all signatures signed according to speci(cid:12)cation are accept-
ed during veri(cid:12)cation.
3.2 Notions of Security of threshold ring sig-
nature
Security of TRS schemes has two aspects: unforgeability
and anonymity. Before giving their de(cid:12)nition, we consider
the following oracles which together model the ability of the
adversaries in breaking the security of the schemes.
• pki ← J O(⊥). The Joining Oracle, on request, adds

pk ∈ PK of the new user.
• ski ← CO(pki). The Corruption Oracle, on input a
public key pki ∈ PK that is a query output of J O,
returns the corresponding secret key ski ∈ SK.
′ ← SO(n, d,Y,V, M ). The Signing Oracle, on input
a group size n, a threshold d ∈ {1, . . . , n}, a set Y of n
public keys, a signer subset V of Y with |V| = d, and
a message M , returns a valid signature σ

(unforgeability). A TRS scheme
is unforgeable if for all PPT adversary A, AdvunfA (λ)
is negligible.
2. Anonymity.
Anonymity for TRS schemes is de(cid:12)ned in the following
game between the Simulator S and the Adversary A
in which A is given access to oracles J O, CO and SO:
(a) S generates and gives A the system parameters
param.
(b) A may query the oracles according to any adap-
tive strategy. Suppose A makes a total number of
v queries to CO. The restriction is that: v < n−d.
(c) A gives S a group size n, threshold d ∈ {1, . . . , n},
message M , and a set Y of n public keys all of
which are query outputs of J O. S picks randomly
a subset V of Y with |V| = d, such that V is not
contained in any of the queries to SO and CO.
Let X be a set of secret keys with |X| = d and
whose corresponding public keys are all contained
in V. S computes σ
= Sign ( n, d, Y, V, X , M ).
(d) A queries the oracles adaptively. Suppose A makes
queries to CO. The restric-

Remark: An alternative approach to specify the SO is to
exclude the signer set V from the input and have SO select
it according to suitable random distribution. We do not
pursue that alternative further.
1. Unforgeability.
Unforgeability for LTRS schemes is de(cid:12)ned in the fol-
lowing game between the Simulator S and the Adver-
sary A in which A is given access to oracles J O, CO
and SO:
(a) S generates and gives A the system parameters
(b) A may query the oracles according to any adap-
tive strategy.

We extend the 1-out-of-n SW ring signature scheme [26]
into a d-out-of-n threshold setting.

generator (N = pq, G, GT , ^e) ← G(1(cid:21)). Suppose the
group generator G also gives the generators g1, B0, u,

Everyone can check the validity of g1, g2, h1, h2 using
pairings.
