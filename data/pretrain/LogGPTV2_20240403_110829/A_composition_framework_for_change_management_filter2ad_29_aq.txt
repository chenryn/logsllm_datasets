Three  knowledge  areas  are  active  in  the  Closing  Process  Phase  of  the  Project  
Management Lifecycle (PMLC), as shown in Figure 1-1. The OCM Practitioner will  
focus on transitioning the OCM efort to the organization’s operational environment  
and evaluating any additional training needs of end users and Stakeholders. 
1.1  Introduction 
During the Closing Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner will formally closeout the 
OCM efort alongside the project team. This includes the transition of ongoing 
communications  to  the  end-users  and  Stakeholders  to  the  organization’s 
operational group and collecting lessons learned to be used for future projects. 
At this time the valuation of end user and Stakeholder post-implementation 
training needs will be analyzed to gauge training efectiveness. 
OCM Lifecycle Management 
The  OCM  Practitioner  works  closely  with  the  Project  Manager  throughout 
the Closing Process Phase to ensure that final OCM documentation, closeout 
approvals, resource allocation, and other transition tasks occur in an orderly 
and  timely  fashion.  This  includes  the  documentation  of  lessons  learned  and 
support  for  the  completion  of  the  Post-Implementation  Evaluation  Report 
(PIER).

Communication 
The  OCM  Practitioner  transitions  the  project  communication  activities  to 
the  organization’s  operational  support  group.  OCM  related  communications 
continue  to  be  important  afer  the  solution  deployment  as  they  provide 
messages regarding any process or solution refinements, as well as ongoing 
training and support opportunities. 
Training 
Afer  the  solution  is  deployed,  the  OCM  Practitioner  working  with  training 
resources, depending on the efort, evaluates the training program to determine 
if there is a need for any additional training or on-the-job support. Refresher 
courses  for  end  users  may  be  delivered  to  further  enhance  the  knowledge, 
skills, and abilities of end users and Stakeholders. 
Once all OCM-related Closing Process Phase activities have been completed, 
the OCM Practitioner will complete the OCM Closing Process Phase Checklist. 
Figure 1-2 shows the goals, inputs, activities, and outputs of the six knowledge 
areas that are active during the Closing Process Phase.

1.2  Recommended Practices 
The  following  recommended  practices  will  assist  the  OCM  Practitioner  in 
working to close the project. This includes the transition from implementation 
to  operational  support,  and  any  additional  training  support  that  may  be 
necessary. These recommended practices apply to all OCM knowledge areas.

Practices 
Review recommended 
practices at the start of  
the process phase. 
Recognize Post Deployment has Ongoing OCM Needs 
At  the  conclusion  of  the  Executing  Process  Phase,  the  new  processes  and 
technology solutions have been deployed; however, the Closing Process Phase 
has ongoing OCM-related needs. It is important to recognize these end user and 
Stakeholder communication and training needs, as these needs do not end at 
go-live. Stakeholders will need communications to understand how the changes 
implemented are driving organizational success and how the project will move 
into the maintenance and operations environment. In addition, there may still 
be a need for ongoing training eforts, such as refresh and new hire training. The 
OCM Practitioner may need to continue communication and training activities 
post-deployment as needed. 
Take Lessons Learned Seriously 
There can be a tendency for project team members to feel that they are just 
going through the motions in providing lessons learned feedback in order to 
“check the box”. Instead, the OCM Practitioner should promote OCM lessons 
learned  sessions  or  surveys  as  valuable  opportunities  to  capture  what  went 
well and what could have been done more efectively. The OCM Practitioner 
should  stress  to  the  project  team  that  thorough  and  honest  lessons  learned 
feedback provides learning and growth opportunities for the organization, the 
OCM Practitioner, and the project team. 
Communications are Equally Important afer Implementation 
When end users and Stakeholders begin using the new solution, there needs to be 
a clear channel of communication and method to obtain pertinent information 
afer the implementation. There are ofen new releases that address process 
and/or system changes which need to be efectively communicated on a timely 
basis.

End Users and Stakeholders Need Access to Additional Training  
While training is provided before implementation, end users and Stakeholders 
ofen find that they need additional training or refresher training afer working 
in the future state. Additional questions and training needs may arise once end 
users and Stakeholders apply the new processes and system in their day-to-
day job functions as opposed to a training environment. The OCM Practitioner 
working with training resources may need to work together to determine and 
address any additional training needs.

The objective of OCM Lifecycle Management is to ensure the performance of 
the OCM efort is efective and complete, as shown in Figure 2-1. In the Closing 
Process Phase, this translates into closing or transitioning the OCM activities in 
an orderly fashion. The OCM Practitioner works on OCM-related closeout tasks, 
as well as completing lessons learned, communicating project transitions, and 
planning for additional training opportunities. 
A  summary  of  the  inputs,  roles,  skills,  activities,  tools,  and  outputs  of  the

2.1.3 Activities 
In order to close or transition the OCM eforts of the project, the OCM Practitioner 
should work with the project team to identify necessary close out and transition 
tasks and complete them based on the project’s needs. 
Close Out the OCM Project 
In order to close-out the OCM efort, the OCM Practitioner should work with the 
project team to identify these tasks and perform them as required. This activity 
consist of the following tasks: 
•  Archive OCM Artifacts 
•  Conduct Lessons Learned 
•  Support Completion of the Post-Implementation Evaluation Report 
Archive OCM Artifacts 
Artifacts from this OCM project are a crucial source of information for improving 
future OCM eforts. All records, both electronic and hard copy, should be stored 
according to applicable project document management rules and guidelines. 
The project archive should contain a document that includes a description of 
all files being stored, the storage location, and a point of contact for further 
information. Typically, at a minimum, archived OCM artifacts include:

Conduct Lessons Learned 
During  the  Closing  Process  Phase,  the  OCM  Practitioner  should  conduct 
lessons  learned  session(s)  with  project  team  members  who  participated  in 
OCM activities. The objective of conducting lessons learned is to identify both 
the  positive  and  negative  lessons  learned  from  the  OCM  efort,  as  well  as 
recommended corrective actions for negatively-based observations that should 
be considered for future projects. 
To conduct lessons learned, the OCM Practitioner should facilitate sessions to  
identify and analyze each major negative and positive event that impacted the  
OCM workstream. As items are identified and discussed, the OCM Practitioner  
documents them in the lessons learned template included in the CA-PMF. The  
template helps the project team document each lesson learned. This includes  
identifying the PMLC stage in which the event occurred, the initiator of the lesson  
learned and his or her role, and the recommendation to avoid the problem or take  
advantage of the opportunity. The OCM Practitioner also documents a description  
of the lesson learned and any recommendation for future OCM projects. 
The  completed  lessons  learned  documentation  represents  knowledge  and 
experience  gained  during  the  project  and  should  be  archived  and  made 
available for future consideration. For more information on conducting lessons 
learned, see the Closing Chapter of the CA-PMF. 
Support Completion of the Post-Implementation  
Evaluation Report 
The California Department of Technology (CDT) requires projects to complete 
and submit a Post Implementation Evaluation Report (PIER) following project 
completion. The OCM Practitioner may be asked to complete portions of the 
PIER  that  pertain  to  the  OCM  efort.  For  more  information  on  the  PIER,  see 
Section  50  of  the  Statewide  Information  Management  Manual  (SIMM)  which 
contains  “Instructions  for  Completing  the  Post  Implementation  Evaluation 
Report (PIER).” These instructions describe when a PIER is required, its contents, 
and procedures for submission and approval.
