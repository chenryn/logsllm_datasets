**Reviewer #1**

**Strengths:**
- Detailed explanation of the parameter choices (zone size, epochs, and number of samples).
- Extensive set of measurements over space, time, and wireless networks.
- Evaluation of the benefits of a multi-network strategy for data connectivity.

**Weaknesses:**
- The framework idea is expected, so the key contribution lies in the choice of parameters. However, the parameters are based on data collected in one city, making it unclear how reusable they are in other environments like the countryside or dense urban areas like New York City.

**Comments to Authors:**
- The attention to parameter selection is commendable. The paper is well-written, and the idea is clear.
- Since data is collected from buses, there may be some bias, as data from one location is often collected around the same time.
- Aggregation in space: It appears that the study aggregates over time rather than keeping time constant. How would the standard deviation look if different zones were compared during the same time of day?
- It would be beneficial to see similar results from other environments like Manhattan or the countryside.
- Have you evaluated the incremental benefits of having zones of different sizes or shapes (e.g., clustering)?
- RTT is an important metric for wireless environments. Why is it not part of the zone size evaluation?
- The section on multi-SIM, MAR, and network dominance is interesting and could be further developed in future papers.

**Reviewer #2**

**Strengths:**
- Rich data: performance of three cellular networks measured by clients at various locations.
- The use of client-side measurements for network monitoring makes sense.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper focuses on aggregation, which can miss temporal and spatial dynamics.

**Comments to Authors:**
- The paper is enjoyable to read. Understanding the effectiveness of using client-side measurements to quantify wide-area wireless network performance is valuable.
- While understanding the level of aggregation in time and space is useful, the paper should focus more on the less obvious and more challenging aspects of the applications.
- Aggregation filters out interesting variations across time and space, which are equally, if not more, important.
- The authors' promise to publish their datasets is very useful to the community.

**Reviewer #3**

**Strengths:**
- Detailed and well-thought-out measurement study.
- Empirically informed design.
- Potential impact of the data.

**Weaknesses:**
- Tedious to read, though this is not specific to this paper.
- Unclear how actionable the results are, except for long-term network planning and fault detection.

**Comments to Authors:**
- How can this data be acted upon? For example, if a user observes poor performance, how can this data help them improve or diagnose their issues?
- Can uplink and downlink performance be isolated, given the asymmetry of cellular links?
- How are measurements impacted by client parameters such as battery levels? This is not a concern with laptops but could be with smartphones.

**Reviewer #4**

**Strengths:**
- Extensive measurements from a variety of situations.
- The framework has practical applications.
- The authors intend to share their measurements.

**Weaknesses:**
- The active measurement approach seems less ideal than a passive one for gathering information for network providers.
- The presentation needs improvement, particularly in clarifying which data sets are being used.
- The paper does not consider smartphones and practical deployment issues.

**Comments to Authors:**
- A more compelling motivation is needed for why network operators would want to use this framework.
- Most of the information shown in the paper could be gathered with passive measurements, which have numerous benefits, such as no overhead on the wireless infrastructure, actual user traffic, and no need to instrument user devices.
- Users could benefit from comparing the performance of multiple network providers in a given location, but this has limited applicability for most cell phone users who have contracts with one provider.
- The paper should discuss the benefits of passive measurements for providers.

**Minor Comments:**
- Section 2: Clarify the potential impact of throughput tests on other users in all wireless environments.
- Section 3.1: Explain the intuition behind driving in a 250-meter radius.
- Section 3.2: Provide insight on the test duration that provides a reasonable throughput value with low variance.
- Section 3.3: Clarify the number of clients available for UDP downloads.
- Section 3.4: Clarify what is meant by "sufficient collect accurate statistics."
- Section 4: Correct the caption in Figure 9.
- Section 4.1: Clarify why throughput tests cannot detect zones with highly variable performance.
- Section 4.2.1: Clarify which is the "best networkâ€™s metric."
- Section 4.2.2: Discuss the use of synthetic workloads in SURGE.
- Section 5: Consider the comments on passive measurements.

**Reviewer #5**

**Strengths:**
- Real data, geographically dispersed, over a year.
- Data submitted to CRAWDAD.

**Weaknesses:**
- Most of the hard systems problems were not addressed, including the challenge of scale.
- It is unclear how typical the data is regarding line-of-sight problems.

**Comments to Authors:**
- The paper has two parts: the measurement collection system and the results of the measurements.
- The measurement collection system ignores the hard parts of the problem, including those stated by the authors.
- The measurements themselves may be independently useful, especially since they are publicly available via CRAWDAD.
- The core technical challenges related to scaling are not explicitly considered in the system.
- The lack of consideration for bandwidth, power consumption, and the number of simultaneous clients makes the assertion that client-side monitoring is viable unsupported.
- Deployment challenges, such as getting the measurement infrastructure onto enough client phones, are not mentioned.
- The fact that WiScape has not been tested on an actual portable handset is a significant drawback.
- Line-of-sight issues in cellular networks are not sufficiently addressed. Buses on roads do not have significant line-of-sight issues, but indoor locations might.
- The graphs in Figure 5 are interesting; if this is the first to present this level of data, please state so.
- In Section 3.1, clarify if zones are assumed to be square and why other shapes are not considered.
- The data in Figure 4 seems to contradict Figures 1 and 9. Why are the relative standard deviations so small in Figure 4 when other figures show higher variation?
- In Section 3.2, the assumption that "stable is better" may not be valid, as operators are more interested in "trouble spots."
- The conclusion does not add much to the paper. What are the concrete next steps?

**Response from the Authors:**
- We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments, which helped improve the paper. We have fixed the text to address some concerns regarding clarity.
- Questions about the scalability and generalizability of our observations can only be answered by expanding the study to broader geographical locations and involving more people. We intend to do so in the future and have expanded the conclusions section to describe our next steps.
- Designing and deploying a client-assisted wide-area wireless network monitoring system involves addressing multiple challenges. Our main contribution is to analyze measurement data for three cellular service providers over an entire city and other locations for two years, and to identify characteristics that help estimate performance efficiently.
- We are actively working towards building a measurement platform for vehicular communication systems and cellphone users.
- We agree that passive measurement is a potential alternative for understanding network performance and are augmenting our mechanisms with passive estimation techniques.
- We have shown how client-assisted monitoring can help network service providers and users of multiple cellular cards. We will explore other aspects of cellular network monitoring that client-assisted monitoring can help with.
- Specific comments:
  - **Reviewer#3:** The test duration of 75 minutes refers to the interval at which measurements need to be retaken. The tests themselves involve sending 40-120 packets.
  - **Reviewer#5:** "Stable is better" means that fewer measurements are needed to converge to the correct estimate if the network is stable.
  - **Reviewer#5:** The data in Figure 4 shows smaller standard deviations because the zones in Figure 1 have a radius of 800 meters and include locations with fewer than 200 measurements, leading to high standard deviations. In Figure 9, the higher relative standard deviation is for zones with multiple ping failures, indicating high performance variance.
  - **Reviewer#5:** All static measurements were taken in indoor locations, not in line-of-sight from the base station. This has been clarified in the text.
