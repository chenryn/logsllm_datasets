AV and utilize drones equipped with IR lights to attack the target
AV. According to our experiments, although it is difficult for the
human driver to see or hear the drones during the night, it is still
possible for passengers or other vehicles to see or detect the suspi-
cious drone, which may increase the risk of attack failure. For the
SLAM attack, the attacker should implement multiple small IR light
sources in the parking lot, which may increase the risk of exposing
the identity of the attacker.
7.3 Precision Requirements
As introduced in section 4.1.2 and section 4.2, the attacker should
control the IR light source to aim the target cameras on the AVs.
However, in practice, the speed of the AV and the distance between
the target AV and the attacker will affect the attacker results. Specif-
ically, as the speed increases, the attack success rate will be reduced.
This is because the larger speed will introduce higher vibration
(i.e., engine vibration and high speed wind vibration) to the target
vehicle and the attacker’s vehicle. Since the size of the forward
camera for the autonomous vehicle (i.e., Tesla model 3) is limited
(i.e., around 20cmx20cm), the attacker should make sure that the
spot generated by the IR light source is in the correct area, which
requires the attacker to precisely control the direction of IR light
source. This requirement is relatively hard to achieve due to the
non-linear properties introduced by the vibration and vehicle mo-
tions. Fortunately, since the IR light is continuous and travels at
light speed, the attacker can conduct an extremely high number of
attacks in a very short time with no delay. Therefore, it is relatively
easy for the attacker to attack the autonomous vehicle.
When the distance between the attacker and the target vehicle
increases, the attacker has to use a high power IR light source to
attack the autonomous vehicle, which will significantly increase the
cost of the hardware. Moreover, the larger distance will introduce
larger IR light spot on the target vehicle, which will trigger the
system alerts. Therefore, the attacker should carefully control the
Figure 17: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
curves for the detection module.
ICSL Attack detection module is 0.82. This is because we set several
thresholds to conduct the reflection surface selection. In real-world
scenarios, especially at night, the light conditions are complex and
hard to predict. In our experiment, although we utilize the road
surface to analyze the reflected light, the light interference from
the environment is severe, which reduces the accuracy of the final
results. It is possible to utilize advanced deep learning algorithms
to predict the potential reflection surface. However, this approach
typically requires high computation resources and does not support
real-time processing, which is not suitable for autonomous vehicles
[36, 39]. According to our experiment, we believe that 0.82 AUC is
sufficient so that the human driver to be aware of a potential attack.
7 DISCUSSIONS & ATTACK LIMITATIONS
In this section, we first discuss the attack generality and attack
stealthiness. Second, we will analyze the precision requirements for
the attacker to control the IR light source. Then, we will introduce
several important issues that may affect the attack results. At last,
we will discuss the trade-offs between different defense solutions.
7.1 Attack Generality
The proposed ICSL Attack mainly focuses on the camera embedded
in the autonomous vehicle. To alter the environment perception
results, the attacker can drive in front of the target AV or use a
drone equipped with IR light LEDs to attack the AV’s forward
camera. Moreover, the attacker can also deploy the IR light LEDs
on the road to attack the AV’s SLAM system. We believe that the
proposed attack has the following advantages, which introduce
severe security risks to the autonomous vehicle.
IR light is invisible. As mentioned in section 2.2, human eyes
cannot see the lights with wavelengths larger than 740𝑛𝑚. There-
fore, even if the current autonomous vehicle requires the human
driver to always be aware of the surroundings, it does not provide
any benefit against the ICSL Attack. On the contrary, the camera
detects the IR light and simply considers the IR light as visible light
to make driving decisions. The mismatches between human eyes
and the camera introduce security risks to the AV. For example, in
this paper, we have shown that the attacker can build an invisible
red traffic light to change the driving behaviors of AV. In practice,

its calculated SLAM trajectory, which may reduce the impact of
ICSL Attack. However, since lots of autonomous vehicle compa-
nies mainly focus on the Automated Valet Parking in the indoor
parking lot scenario and the key part of their solution is to conduct
HD mapping based on SLAM [11, 12, 27], we believe that the ICSL
Attack introduces security risks to the autonomous vehicle.
Impact of Cameras. Since the proposed attack relies on the cam-
era to detect the IR light, it is important to analyze the types of
shutter and the color filter arrays in the camera.
• Types of shutter. There are two important types of shutters in
the camera: global shutter and rolling shutter. For the global shutter,
it exposes all the pixels in a frame at the same time while for the
rolling shutter, it exposes the pixels in a frame sequentially (line-
by-line). However, these two types of shutter will not affect the
attack results. For the environment perception attack, the attacker
continuously transmit the IR light to the camera. Therefore, as long
as the camera can detect the IR light, it will be affected by the attack.
For the SLAM attack, the IR light is flashing. However, the flashing
rate for the IR light is lower than 1Hz, which is much less than the
minimum shutter speed for cameras (30 Hz). Therefore, it is highly
possible for the camera to capture the IR light.
• Color filters arrays. Currently, the autonomous vehicles mainly
utilize RCCC (Red Clear Clear Clear), RCCB (Red Clear Clear Blue)
and RGGB (Red Green Green Blue) color filter arrays. Generally,
RCCC and RCCB color filter arrays are designed for computer vision
purposes. Although they cannot achieve high color accuracy, these
types of filters have high dynamic range and good performance
during the nighttime. Therefore, according to their advantages,
these cameras are normally utilized as the forward cameras and
side cameras in the AVs. To be more specific, for the RCCC filter, it
is highly sensitive to red light and IR light. Therefore, the RCCC
camera is vulnerable to ICSL attack. For the RCCB filter, it is sensi-
tive to red and blue color. This type of filters are the filters utilized
in the front and side cameras in the Tesla Model 3. As shown in
this paper, the camera with RCCB filter is also vulnerable to ICSL
Attack.
Different from RCCC and RCCB cameras, the RGGB color filter
array is designed for human eyes. It has the highest color accuracy.
Normally, the camera with RGGB color filter arrays is utilized as
the rear camera of the AV. This type of camera also can detect the
IR light. For ICSL Attack, since the RGGB camera has the highest
color accuracy, it can detect the fake traffic signal based on the
color of the red light. However, in practice, since the RGGB camera
has low dynamic range and poor performance in the nighttime, it
is not utilized as the forward camera and side camera. Therefore,
the ICSL Attack remains unaffected.
7.5 Trade-offs Between Defense Solutions
The proposed ICSL attack can alter the environment perception and
SLAM results of the AV. For the environment perception attack, it
can introduce fake objects or fake traffic signals, which may result
in potential car accidents. For the SLAM attack, it introduces high
localization error to the AV, which will affect the performance of
the AV or even result in navigation to a wrong destination.
In practice, to analyze the performance and the safety of the
AV, miles per disengagement (MPD) is one of the most important
Figure 18: The spectrum of Solar Radiation and the ICSL At-
tack
mounted aspheric lens on the IR light source according to the attack
scenarios.
The changing rate of the autonomous vehicle heading will also
affect the attack results. Formally, we represent the vehicle heading
as 𝜑 and the changing rate of the heading can be represented as (cid:164)𝜑.
Generally, the heading of the autonomous vehicle is determined
by the steering angle 𝛿, the wheelbase length (the length of the
front axle to the center of the gravity 𝑙𝑓 plus the length of the rear
axle to the center of the gravity 𝑙𝑟 ) and the speed of the vehicle 𝑣
[30, 42, 72]. Then, according to the vehicle dynamics, the changing
rate of the vehicle heading can be represented as:
(cid:164)𝜑 =
𝑡𝑎𝑛(𝛿)
𝑣
𝑙𝑓 + 𝑙𝑟
(8)
As shown in this equation, despite the impact of high speed, the
change of the steering angle will affect the heading of the AV. In
practice, to maintain proper lane position, the AV should control its
steering angle to adjust its lateral position. For example, the wheel-
base of Tesla model 3 is 2875𝑚𝑚 and the maximum steering angle is
around 36 degrees. Since the weight distribution of Tesla model 3 is
50/50, the maximum changing rate of the vehicle heading for Tesla
can be modeled as: (cid:164)𝜑 = 0.289𝑣. Therefore, the attacker should make
sure the minimal changing rate of the aiming direction should at
least satisfy the above equation. Assume the distances between the
attacker and the Tesla model 3 is between 5m to 15m, when the
speed of the Tesla model 3 is 40mph, the approximate changing
rate of the aiming direction should be in the range: 0.5◦/𝑠 − 1.8◦/𝑠.
7.4 Attack Environments & Limitations
Impact of Solar Radiation. Due to the power limitation of the
IR light LEDs, in this paper, the ICSL Attack is mainly conducted
during the night to prove the concept. This is because the solar
radiation (i.e., electromagnetic energy from the sun) will interfere
with the low-power IR light. As we can see from Figure 18, although
most of the solar radiation is visible light, the lights from 700𝑛𝑚
to 940𝑛𝑚 (i.e., overlapped with the ICSL attack) still receives high
radiation power. As a result, although the camera can still detect
the IR light, the detection results are unpredictable. However, in
practice, we argue that the attacker can always purchase high-
power IR light sources to mitigate the impact of the solar radiation
interference.
Impact of GPS. To alter the SLAM localization and mapping re-
sults, we mainly attack the AV in an indoor parking lot. In this
scenario, since there is no GPS signal available, the AV has to rely
on the data gathered from the camera. In the outdoor scenario, the

form autonomous driving without detecting the system failure or
requiring the human driver to disengage the autonomous mode
due to the safe operation requirements. Normally, according to the
different AV companies, the MPD varies from 0.49 to 29,944.69 [25].
However, as shown in Figure 11, the autonomous vehicle requires
6 interventions in around 0.27 miles in a parking lot. The corre-
sponding MPD is around 0.045, which is much worse than the MPD
of the AV without ICSL attack and the performance of the AV is
hampered
As mentioned in section 6, to defend against the ICSL attack, the
easiest way is to implement IR filters in the camera. In this case,
since the IR light is filtered out, the AV is not vulnerable under ICSL
attack. This approach is robust under different driving scenarios
and does not require complex machine learning models.
However, this solution also introduces new challenges. First,
since most of the light sources (i.e., the Moonlight, vehicle light,
halogen lamp, etc.) emit IR light energy, the camera in the AV can
utilize these lights to improve the quality of the captured frame
at night [41]. By filtering out the IR light, the performance of the
camera in the AV will be hampered. Second, after implementing
the IR filter, the color information of the frames captured by the
camera will be inaccurate or wrong [31, 71], which will affect the
environment perception results.
To overcome the first challenge, the AV company can implement
LiDAR (around $5000 [21]) on the AV and develop algorithms or
architectures to fuse the environment perception results of LiDAR
and camera together. To overcome the second challenge, color
correction and calibration should be conducted, which requires
engineers to not only build complicated models but also manually
correct the color according to different scenarios and types of the
cameras. This process is time-consuming and will increase the cost
of the AV.
As introduced in section 6, another solution is to explore the
features of IR lights and utilize machine learning techniques to dis-
tinguish IR lights and visible lights. This solution is a software-based
approach and does not require additional hardware or redesign of
the camera, which reduces the cost of the AV. However, since the
driving scenarios of the autonomous vehicles are various, it requires
the AV company to collect a huge amount of data to train the model,
which is time-consuming. Moreover, different from the IR light fil-
ter solution, the performance of this software-based approach is
highly sensitive to different light conditions, object materials and
weather conditions. Therefore, the robustness of this approach is
not as high as the IR light filter solution.
8 RELATED WORK
Attacks on Autonomous Vehicles. Extensive prior works have
been conducted to explore the security risks of Autonomous Vehicle
[32, 34, 47, 53, 58, 65–68, 75, 77]. In the field of sensor attack, by
utilizing advanced hardware, researchers have shown that the Ultra-
sonic Sensor is vulnerable to jamming, Denial of Service (DoS) and
the delay injection attack [37, 56]. For the LiDAR sensor, the one
of the most common attack methods are LiDAR spoofing attacks
[34, 58, 67]. The vulnerability of Mid-range Radar is also widely
studied by multiple researchers [48, 77]. Instead of requiring spe-
cially designed hardware, the attack on AV’s camera is relatively
easy for the attacker to implement, which introduces severe secu-
rity risks. For example, the attack can simply deploy toxic signs to
misleading the autonomous vehicle [50, 70]. One of the most recent
work Phantom Attack successfully changes the driving decisions of
AV by projecting a phantom (i.e., a fake image or traffic sign) on the
road by using a drone equipped with a projector [52]. According to
these researches, current autonomous driving system requires the
human driver to always ber aware of the driving conditions, which
helps the AV to defend against the potential attacks.
Different from their works, in this paper, we propose ICSL Attack,
