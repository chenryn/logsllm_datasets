User: I installed the package and ran all of the correct commands. I did this for 2.6.1, 2.7, and 3.2. Between each I subsequently uninstalled the previous version. Within each version I went into the python folder and ran the python installation commands.
I ran brew install protobuf (and subsequently uninstalled it).
I ran sudo pip install protobuf (and subsequently uninstalled it).

The issue I am constantly getting is that the generated .py protobuf file calls imports from google.protobuf, but I am returned an error: ImportError: No module named google.protobuf
I then copy in the google folder (which you shouldn't have to do) and it stops returning that error, but the file and examples won't work.
Assistant: I was/am using PyCharm. The protobuf library doesn't automatically get linked to the PyCharm interpreter. If you run python script.py from the command line, there are no issues with missing modules.
