the clock synchronization model. We assume an asymmet-
ric identiﬁcation probability of 0.95, and assume that the
probability of a good node being convicted if an asymmet-
ric fault occurs is 1/GN . 1/GN is the minimum for good
node conviction in TTP/C, since the symmetric category
covers cases where all receivers correctly identify the fault
source. More probabilities are investigated in the sensitivity
analysis, but the expected probability of good node convic-
tion is uncertain. Some protocols forbid good node con-
viction [25]. Our hypothesized membership service (Con-
vict Some) may misclassify faults. Not all permanent faulty
nodes will be convicted, and some transient faulty nodes
will be mistakenly convicted, as shown in Table 7.
For membership, the system state S is given by the tu-
ple {GN , PSN , PBN , TAN , TSN , TBN , AN C, SN C, BN C,
CONV, GC, PAC, PBC, TAC, TSC}, where Σ (GN , PSN ,
PBN , TAN , TSN , TBN , AN C, SN C, BN C, CONV) equals
the total number of nodes N and Σ (GC, PAC, PBC, TAC,
TSC) equals the total number of channels C. For the Convict
Some strategy, the smallest models (four nodes) had 128
states and 1121 transitions. The largest models (fourteen
nodes) had 91,866 states and 1,104,902 transitions. Model
size can vary by strategy (for example, in the Convict None
strategy, Prob. Conv. Trans., Prob. Conv. Perm., and Prob.
Conv. Good are zero so the related transitions are removed).
SEL, SEU, BER. For group membership, benign faults
are now symmetric since they may cause data value errors.
Asymmetric faults from these sources remain the same.
Permanent Fault Conviction. Permanent faulty nodes,
if detected, can be convicted and removed from the group.
The rate is multiplied by the probability of convicting a per-
manent faulty node. For asymmetric faults, the conviction
rate is also multiplied by the probability of correctly identi-
fying an asymmetric faulty node. The diagnosis algorithm
takes two rounds (worst-case) to execute, so the rate per
hour is (1 / (2*Round Duration)).
Transient Expiration; Transient Conviction. Tran-
sient faulty nodes may be misdiagnosed as permanent faulty
and convicted, at some probability. The rate for this set of
transitions is (1 / (2*Round Duration)).
Good Node Conviction. A new transition is introduced
from GN to CONV, at a rate of (1 / (2*Round Duration))
with a probability of 1/GN . Good node conviction only oc-
curs if an asymmetric fault is present, so the guard is [∃ AN
∨ ∃ AN C]. This rate is not multiplied by the number of
good nodes since an asymmetric fault does not necessarily
affect more nodes if the group is larger.
Channels.
In group membership, a channel may be
symmetric faulty. In TTP/C, if one channel is noisy and the
other silent, the receiver counts this as a null frame (not an
invalid frame) [37]. Thus a symmetric faulty frame will be
received only if both channels are symmetric faulty (since
an asymmetric channel dominates all faulty channels).
3.4 Extensibility
Although we focus on a particular set of physical faults,
the reliability models and modeling techniques are not lim-
ited to this set. We demonstrate extensibility by represent-
ing a latent fault, as described in the DBench Dependability
Benchmarking project [10]. Latent faults are characterized
by a potentially long delay between the fault arrival and the
observed component failure. For example, latent faults can
occur due to accumulated errors in registers that are not di-
rectly observable by the user [10].
One way to represent this type of fault would be to ex-
Imagine two types of
plicitly model accumulated errors.
error counter states, a good register state GR and a faulty
register state FR. At initialization, there is a speciﬁed max-
imum number RMAX of GR registers and there are zero
FR registers. A latent fault is represented by a transition
from GR to FR at some rate λlatent. If latent faults have oc-
curred, these faults may cause good nodes to become faulty.
Assume that after some minimum number of latent faults
MINFAULT that a good node may become permanently be-
nign faulty. This can be modeled as a transition from GN
to PBN at some rate λactivate (or, at a rate that is a function
of the number of latent errors c*FR*λactivate for some con-
stant c). The transition will be guarded with [FR >= MIN-
FAULT] for some value of 0  10−8

conﬁgurations with the same fault rates are compared.

In both hybrid fault models, the assumption failure rate
was most sensitive to the Bit Error Rate. The Welch and
Lynch hybrid fault model was about equally sensitive to
SEU and Permanent Link faults. The Strictly Omissive
Asymmetric model was more sensitive to Permanent Link
faults than SEU faults. As Table 9 shows, the Welch and
Lynch model is likely to fail from active faults. In all con-
ﬁgurations except 4 node conﬁgurations, MFA.3 (see Table
3) was more likely to be violated. The Strictly Omissive
Asymmetric model balances the risk of active faults vs. the
risk of inadequate redundancy. MFA.1 was more likely to
be violated in some conﬁgurations, MFA.2 in others.
Adopting a Strictly Omissive Asymmetric model should
be feasible. The clock synchronization algorithm needs to
exclude null or detectably invalid values from the voting
process. Since correction values are typically stored in a
table [13], just valid values in the table could be voted.
4.2 Membership Results
Table 10 summarizes the assumption failure rate for all
of the conﬁgurations for the three diagnosis strategies stud-
ied. Figure 2 plots the percentage of conﬁgurations that
fall into each assumption failure rate bin. Table 11 lists the
number of conﬁgurations for each strategy according to the
dominant cause of failure.
