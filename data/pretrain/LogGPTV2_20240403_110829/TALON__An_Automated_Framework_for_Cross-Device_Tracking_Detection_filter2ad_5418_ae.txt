### Analysis of Ad Campaigns and Browsing Modes

We focused on a set of personas that had the most active ad campaigns and were particularly promising due to their interest in "online shopping." The desktops (both paired and baseline) executed browsing in a stateless mode, while the mobile device operated in a stateful mode. For each persona, we conducted two runs, following the timeline of phases as in Setup 1a.

**Key Findings:**
- The distributions of ads between the mobile and paired desktop, as well as between the mobile and baseline desktop, were found to be different (highest p-value = 0.034).
- None of the machine learning classifiers achieved a performance higher than 0.7 across all metrics, indicating no clear significant results.
- The highest AUC scores for personas 1 and 2 were 0.70 using the Random Forest classifier, and for personas 3 and 4 were 0.73 using the Logistic Regression classifier.
- Persona 5 had the worst performance, with an AUC of 0.57 and Precision/Recall scores below 0.50.

### Combined Personas: Setup 3b

When combining data from all five personas, the best-performing classifier was Logistic Regression, with an AUC of 0.79. These results suggest that incognito browsing is semi-effective in limiting cross-device tracking (CDT). By removing the browsing state of a user on a given device, the signal provided to CDT entities is reduced but not fully eliminated. When data from various personas are combined, CDT remains somewhat effective, especially when paired devices share the same IP address.

### Platform Validation

In this section, we validate the representativeness of the data collected from previous experiments by examining:
1. The type and frequency of ads delivered to each device.
2. The type and number of trackers that our personas were exposed to.

**Comparison with Real-World Data:**
- We compare these distributions with past studies and real-user data to assess if our synthetic personas successfully emulate real users' traffic and if our measurements of the CDT ad-ecosystem are realistic.

**Ad Frequency:**
- In most sessions (∼90%), the mobile device was exposed to fewer than five ads, as mobile versions of websites typically deliver fewer ads designed for smaller screens.
- Desktop devices had a higher exposure to ads compared to the mobile device, with an average of 2 to 4 ads per visit to control pages.
- Similar observations were made for the keywords associated with the ads (Figure 6, right panel).

**Tracker Coverage:**
- We used the Disconnect List [18] to detect and measure the frequency of trackers appearing in the webpages visited by the personas (Figure 7).
- 37% of the detected trackers were found to be CDT-related, including both deterministic and probabilistic.
- Top CDT trackers included Google-owned domains, Facebook, Criteo, Zopim, Bing, and Advertising.com (AOL), aligning with findings in [56] and [10].
- 17% of the trackers were primarily focused on probabilistic CDT, including Criteo, BlueKai, AdRoll, Cardlytics, Drawbridge, and Tapad, each appearing in at least 2% of the persona pages.

### Discussion and Conclusion

Through extensive experiments with the proposed framework Talon, we were able to trigger CDT trackers into pairing emulated users' devices. This allowed us to statistically verify that CDT is indeed occurring and measure its effectiveness on different user interests and browsing behaviors, both independently and in combination.

**Key Observations:**
- CDT was prominent when user devices were trained to browse pages of similar interests, reinforcing the behavioral signal sent to CDT entities.
- The CDT effect was amplified when the visited persona and control pages had embedded CDT trackers, pushing the accuracy of detection up to 99%.
- Browsing in a stateless mode showed a reduced but not completely removed CDT effect, as incognito browsing obfuscates the signal sent to the ad-ecosystem but not the network access information.

**Impact on User Privacy:**
- CDT infringes on users' online privacy and minimizes their anonymity. The actual extent of this tracking paradigm and its consequences for users, the community, and even the ad-ecosystem itself, are still unknown.
- Future work should focus on studying the targeting of sensitive user categories (e.g., gender, sexual orientation, race) via CDT, especially in light of recent EU privacy regulations such as GDPR and ePrivacy.

**Talon's Role:**
- Talon provides a concrete, scalable, and extensible methodology for experimenting with different CDT scenarios, auditing its mechanics, and measuring its impact.
- The modular design of our methodology allows for in-depth study of CDT and the proposal of new extensions to study the CDT ecosystem, including new plugins, personas, and ML techniques.
- Our design makes Talon an enhanced transparency tool that reveals potentially illegal biases or discrimination from the ad-ecosystem.
