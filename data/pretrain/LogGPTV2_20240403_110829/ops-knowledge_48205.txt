User: Please tell me about Docker, how is it different from a virtual machine? How to deploy applications using Docker?
Assistant: Docker is an open source containerization technology that can be used to package an application and its dependencies into an isolated container to run anywhere. Unlike traditional virtual machines, Docker containers can run directly on the host OS, and are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines, so they have advantages in resource utilization and deployment efficiency. The steps to deploy an application using Docker include: 1. Install the Docker engine. 2. Write a Dockerfile that defines the application base image and its dependencies, and instructs Docker how to build the application in the container. 3. Build the Docker image by running the docker build command. 4. Use the docker run command to start the container to run the application in the container. In addition, the Docker Compose tool can also be used to orchestrate the relationship and interaction between multiple containers for easier deployment of the entire application.
