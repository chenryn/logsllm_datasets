User: I've researched this on different places, including stackoverflow, and I can't find an answer that helps me.
I'm using Windows 7, 64 bit, with Atom for 64 bit Windows. I have Python 3.6.1 installed in the directory C:\Users\Austin\Documents\Python. When I try to run a simple script to test Python in Atom, it says

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.

I tried to run the same script in the command line, and it said the same thing. I'm new to programming, so please try to be a little patient.
Assistant: None of the above answers worked for me. What did work, is installing Python from the Microsoft Store instead of downloading from the web and installing from an installer.
