### Title: Come to the Dark Side, We Have Apples: Turning macOS Management Evil

**Abstract:**

This talk delves into advanced offensive techniques targeting macOS management platforms, such as Jamf and native MDM. We will introduce new, macOS-specific tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that cover initial access, command and control, persistence, and lateral movement. Key highlights of our research include:

- **Compromising a macOS Device with a Single PLIST File:** We demonstrate how a single configuration file can be used to gain unauthorized access to a macOS device.
- **Compromising Domain Admin Accounts from Jamf-Managed Endpoints:** We explore methods to exploit Jamf-managed endpoints to compromise domain administrator accounts.
- **Bypassing SIP with "Out of the Box" Thinking:** We present innovative approaches to bypass System Integrity Protection (SIP) without relying on traditional methods.

In addition to these attacks, we will provide a deep dive into the internal workings of several management frameworks. This detailed exploration aims to enhance the audience's understanding of macOS environments, enabling them to better operate in these settings.

Finally, we will introduce a variety of new tools, including two unique Mythic C2 agents. These agents leverage macOS management frameworks to control devices without the need for custom code, offering a stealthy and effective means of maintaining control.

By the end of this talk, attendees will have a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities in macOS management platforms and the advanced TTPs that can be used to exploit them.
