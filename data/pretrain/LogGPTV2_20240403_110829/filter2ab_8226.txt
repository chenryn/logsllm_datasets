### Title: Blackhat EU-19 OEM Finder: Hunting Vulnerable OEM IoT Devices at Scale

In recent years, many consumer IoT vendors have adopted an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) production model. Under this model, vendors purchase IoT devices from OEM suppliers, customize them, and then sell them under their own brand names. While this approach can significantly reduce manufacturing costs, it also introduces significant security risks. If the original device is vulnerable, the rebranded (OEM) device is likely to be vulnerable as well. For example, a 2017 survey by IPVM revealed that a vulnerability found in Hikvision's network camera was propagated to numerous OEM devices sold by over 80 different vendors.

Unfortunately, existing vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), often fail to include and announce these vulnerable OEM devices as affected products. One of the primary reasons for this oversight is the lack of an efficient method to identify OEM devices, other than manually inspecting each device or asking the OEM suppliers directly.

To address this supply chain risk, we developed a new tool called OEM Finder. This tool can automatically detect potential OEM device candidates by analyzing the visual similarity between the OEM and original devices. To achieve fast, accurate, and automated detection, we employed an object recognition algorithm (KAZE) combined with k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and graph kernels.

Using OEM Finder, we analyzed over 50,000 IoT device images collected from e-commerce (EC) websites and identified more than 180 unique vulnerable OEM device candidates. We further analyzed the latest firmware images of some of these candidates, which were distributed by the OEM vendors (not the OEM suppliers), and confirmed that the detected devices were indeed OEM devices. Additionally, we found that the firmware images of these OEM devices were still vulnerable.

At the conclusion of our presentation, we will release OEM Finder as an online search engine. By uploading a photo of a vulnerable IoT device, users can generate a list of potential OEM device candidates that may contain the same vulnerability. We believe that this web service will help facilitate the identification of vulnerable OEM devices and mitigate associated security risks.
