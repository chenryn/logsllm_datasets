### Version
2.6.10
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/just_ben1996/5bfs80gk/14/
### Steps to reproduce
  * Create a component with a :is to an 'input' native element.
  * v-model this component to something within your data as shown.
  * Note the input isn't pre-populated with the value, and on change it does not change the value it is bound to with v-model.
### What is expected?
v-model should work as usual, updating the value when changed and displaying
the value initially in the component.
### What is actually happening?
The initial value is not shown in the input component, and on change it does
not update the value it is bound to.
