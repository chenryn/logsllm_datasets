years (including this work), there still exists a large perfor-
mance gap between the plaintext system (generally below a
second) and the privacy preserved system (ranging from sec-
onds to hundreds of second). Nevertheless, it is still promising
to attain the long-term goal for practical implementation of
privacy preserved machine learning. First, the privacy pre-
served machine learning system is to be deployed on clouds
with abundant computation power. Hence, even though it takes
signiﬁcantly more time than the plaintext system on the same
local hardware, running it on clouds with parallel computing
infrastructure can signiﬁcantly reduce the gap. Second, the
research efforts on the in-depth optimization of the privacy-
preserved computation further help to close the runtime gap.
Altogether, the combination of advanced algorithms and cloud
computation resources may enable the privacy-preserved sys-
tem to achieve a response time well suited for some practical
applications in the near future.
