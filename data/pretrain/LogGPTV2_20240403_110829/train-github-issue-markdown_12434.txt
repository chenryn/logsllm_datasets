by **sam.falvo** :
    What does 'go version' print?
    go version go1.2 darwin/amd64
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    0.  export GOPATH=$(pwd)
    1.  go get github.com/mailgun/mailgun-go
    2.  (cd src/github.com/mailgun/mailgun-go && git checkout
    create-acceptance-tests)
    3.  go fmt github.com/mailgun/mailgun-go/acceptance
    What happened?
    It prints:
    """
    can't load package: package github.com/mailgun/mailgun-go/acceptance: no buildable Go
    source files in /Users/sfalvo/go/mailgun-go/src/github.com/mailgun/mailgun-go/acceptance
    """
    What should have happened instead?
    It should have reformatted the sources, printing the list of filenames it affected;
    otherwise, it should have just returned to the shell with no output, indicating no
    changes have been made, just as it does for 'normal' sources.
