Abstract—Device pairing is the problem of having two devices
securely establish a key that can be used to secure subsequent
communication. The problem arises every time two devices that
do not already share a secret need to bootstrap a secure com-
munication channel. Many solutions exist, all suited to different
situations, and all with their own strengths and weaknesses.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to device pairing
that applies whenever a user wants to pair two devises that can
be physically touched at the same time. The pairing process is
easy to perform, even for novice users. A central problem for a
device (Alice) running a device pairing protocol, is determining
whether the other party (Bob) is in fact the device that we are
supposed to establish a key with. Our scheme is based on the
idea that two devices can perform device pairing, if they are
physically held by the same person (at the same time). In order
to pair two devices, a person touches a conductive surface on
each device. While the person is in contact with both devices,
the human body acts as a transmission medium for intra-body
communication and the two devices can communicate through
the body. This body channel is used as part of a pairing protocol
which allows the devices to agree on a mutual secret and, at
the same time, extract physical features to verify that they are
being held by the same person. We prove that our device pairing
protocol is secure in our threat model and we build a proof of
concept set-up and conduct experiments with 15 people to verify
the idea in practice.

INTRODUCTION
Device pairing is the process of bootstrapping secure
communication between two devices that do not share any
common secrets. Often the most challenging part of a device
pairing protocol is to establish the identity of the other device,
i.e., to make sure that one is establishing a key with the
intended device and not someone else. For devices on the
Internet this problem is addressed by relying on certiﬁcate
authorities to certify the identities of hosts, providing a root
of trust when establishing the identity of a communicating
party. For smaller devices that do not necessarily have (or
need) a certiﬁed global identity, certiﬁcate authorities are often
not appropriate. Smaller devices instead often use short range
radio technology like Bluetooth, and rely on a human to certify
the validity to the other device when pairing, e.g., by visually

comparing short strings on a screen, or by typing a number
displayed by one device into the other. Such schemes require
active participation from a human and the security guarantees
provided by these protocols rely on the user performing the
correct actions at the correct time. If the user makes any
mistakes, the security guarantees of these protocols no longer
hold.
In addition to human error, device pairing protocols also
impose certain hardware requirements on devices. This is
not a problem by itself, as all communication requires some
form of hardware support, but screens and input devices place
restrictions on the size and shape of devices, e.g., a device
may have to have a ﬂat surface, and be big enough to support
a usable screen.
In this paper we propose a device pairing protocol for
small devices (e.g., phones, headsets, keyboards, etc.) that
mitigates these two problems. Our protocol does require human
participation but the user never has to make a security relevant
decision and the hardware needed for communication can be
any conductive surface on the device. This eliminates the
possibility of human error and the scheme remains usable
regardless of the physical design of the device (as long as
the device is big enough to touch with a ﬁnger).
Our scheme is based on the core idea that two devices are
allowed to be paired if they are both held by the same human,
at the same time. The rationale behind this decision is that if a
user is physically holding both devices there are very few ways
to secure communication between these devices if the user has
malicious intentions. For example a malicious user could run a
device pairing protocol involving short string comparison (or
any other mechanism), or physically manipulate the devices
to achieve his goal. Our scheme enables device pairing by
having the user touch a conductive surface on each device.
The human body then serves as a transmission medium for
capacitive coupling between the devices which can be used
for communication. We call this communication channel the
“body channel”. Devices can distinguish between messages
sent on this body channel, and messages sent by a remote
attacker, and can thus ignore any message that originates from
an external source. This means that two devices held by a
user effectively have an authenticated channel between them
that can be used for key conﬁrmation. Only a small amount
of data is sent through the body channel, so device pairing is
fast and easy.
We make the following contributions:

establish a shared secret, without the need for certiﬁ-
cates or shared knowledge.
•
• We prove the security of our design. Speciﬁcally, we
reduce the security of the protocol to the security of
the underlying primitives under the assumption that
the body channel is read-only to the attacker.
The read-only assumption models the fact that the
receiving device can tell the difference between mes-
sages sent by an external transmitter, and a device
which is physically connected to the person perform-
ing the pairing. The receiving device can thus ignore
any message that originates from an external source,
which is equivalent to saying that the channel is read-
only for the attacker. We present thorough experiments
to verify this distinguishing ability.
• We design and implement a proof-of-concept proto-
type to conduct the experiments mentioned above and
to experiment with performance and user experience.
II. BACKGROUND ON INTRA-BODY AND
ON-BODY COMMUNICATION
Intra-body communication is a communication technique
that transfers data wirelessly through the human body. Intra-
body communication was ﬁrst proposed in 1995 [38] and has
since been covered in a large body of research literature: Nu-
merous proposals on different transmission methods, receiver
and transmitter types, as well as modulation techniques have
been published, e.g., [8], [33], [37]. These and other promising
results motivated the deﬁnition of intra-body communication
as a physical communication layer in the relatively new IEEE
802.15.6 standard [17] which is the latest international standard
covering Wireless Body Area Networks (BANs).
Even though said standard mentions medical and non-
medical
target applications for intra-body communication,
the main drivers for the development of electric near-ﬁeld
communication in and around the human body have been
the biomedical sciences and the medical ﬁeld. Utilizing the
body as a transmission medium for electrical signals is key
to achieve low-power wireless sensors for (real-time) health
monitoring [4], [13].
The main advantages for the use of intra-body communica-
tion over standard wireless communication for on- and in-body
medical sensors is the high conductivity of the human body
compared to air and the fact that most electromagnetic energy
is not radiated into the environment, but conﬁned through the
body’s surface, resulting in very low energy consumption [4].
Since most of the signal is restricted to the body area, external
(radio frequency) interference does not affect the communi-
cation channel and robust data transmission can be realized
without a large antenna.
Although these features could prove very useful for ap-
plications in the context of Computer Security, the use of
the human body as a communication channel for security
applications is largely unexplored. The possibility to transmit
electrical signals through the human body while most energy is
conﬁned to the transmission medium should be of particular in-
terest and is a property normally not found with other wireless
communication techniques, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. We
test this property in detail in the experiments in Section VIII.
We will now brieﬂy cover existing techniques for body
channel communication to support understanding of our design
choices in the following of this paper. Body-channel commu-
nication can be divided into roughly three groups:
a) Galvanic coupling: The concept of galvanic cou-
pling is to induce alternating current into the human body.
It was ﬁrst proposed for intra-body communication in [36],
[37] and it works by differentially applying a signal over
two electrodes at the transmitter which will induce a current
into the body. Both transmitter and receiver each have two
electrodes that are coupled to the human body as shown in
Figure 1. Most of the induced current ﬂows directly from one
sender electrode to the other, but a small portion propagates
through the body to the receiver where it is detected as the
voltage differential between the two receiver electrodes. The
carrier of the information are the ionic ﬂuids in the body that
form a closed loop for signal transmission [30]. Advantages
of galvanic coupling are virtually no “leakage” of the electric
ﬁeld outside of the body — galvanic coupling does not rely
on electromagnetic transmission, but on electron ﬂow — and
the fact that no external ground reference is needed; the return
path of the signal transmission is the human body.
b) Capacitive coupling: Capacitive coupling uses an
electromagnetic signal for data transmission. The transmitter
emits the signal through an electrode that is in touch with
the human body. After having traversed the body, the signal
is picked up by a receiver which is also coupled to the body
(see Figure 1). The signal return path between transmitter and
receiver is established though the environment by electrostatic
coupling to external conductive objects, most often earth
ground.
This type of communication is enabled by two physical
properties: (1) At a frequency of less than 100 MHz, the
wavelength of an electromagnetic signal is far greater than

the following observations.
a) Transmission distance: The person pairing two de-
vices should be able to touch them with their hands to perform
the pairing. This requires hand-to-hand transmission on the
body channel which can over 180 cm in adults. Capacitive
coupling and surface waves are the only body communication
techniques that have been reported to cover such a distance
reliably. With galvanic coupling only short transmission dis-
tances are possible due to the high attenuation of the signal [4],
[26]. In addition, the frequency ranges where galvanic coupling
operates best are lower than for other techniques, which
signiﬁcantly restricts the data rate for communication [7].
i.e.,
b) Usability and electrode design: Capacitive coupling
only requires one electrode per device to be in physical touch
with the human body,
the person pairing the devices
only needs to touch one electrode with each hand. Unlike
galvanic coupling, which requires at least two electrodes per
device, capacitive coupling only uses a single capacitive touch-
electrode per device. This simpliﬁes the implementation of
body channel enabled devices and makes the action of pairing
two devices straightforward for the user. Additionally,
the
fewer electrodes there are, the less the effect orientation of
transmitter and receiver have on the signal attenuation [18].
We elaborate on the design of the electrodes we used in our
experiments in Section VII-B.
c) Electromagnetic interference: Surface wave tech-
niques and capacitive coupling can both cover a transmission
distance that is sufﬁcient for our application with relatively
little signal attenuation. Compared to capacitive coupling,
surface wave techniques allow more electromagnetic power
to leave the human body during transmission and are more
susceptible to external interference. We aim to design body
channel communication that is difﬁcult to interfere with from
the outside, i.e., with an external radio transmitter. It should
require a lot of energy to inﬂuence the body channel with
a signal source that is not physically connected to the body.
Capacitive coupling, which operates at much lower frequencies
than surface waves, is therefore better suited for our use case.

IV. SYSTEM AND ADVERSARY MODEL

a wireless channel and use the human body as a transmission medium for a
second channel, the human body channel. The body channel is established by
touching electrodes on both devices.
the size of the human body and the electric ﬁeld around the
body can be approximated as constant over time, i.e., the
phase of the signal remains uniform anywhere close to the
human body [3], and (2) the human body can be modeled as a
conducting wire at low frequencies, i.e., capacitive near-ﬁeld
coupling establishes a closed loop for signal transmission [38].
c) Surface wave techniques: Surface techniques are
often referred to as “on-body” or “near-body” transmission.
They use higher frequencies than capacitive coupling and
galvanic coupling. Most often frequencies on the order of
more than 100 MHz are used. While some electromagnetic
waves propagate through the body in a similar way as with
capacitive coupling, usually, a signiﬁcant amount radiates into
the air [35]. In addition, as the signal propagates through the
body it is attenuated considerably [3]. Unlike with capacitive
coupling or galvanic coupling, there is no closed loop for
signal transmission; the receiver just measures the intensity
of the electromagnetic signal analogous to conventional radio
frequency transmission.
III. OUR APPROACH
A. System Model
The device pairing method we present in this paper relies
on intra-body communication. The basic idea is that
two
electronic devices should be allowed to perform device pairing
if they can successfully communicate with each other through
a human body. The fact that two devices can transmit and
receive messages using body communication implies that they
must be physically close to each other and must be held by
the same person. We use this as the criterion for whether two
devices are meant to run a pairing protocol with each other
and establish a mutual secret. A person can give two devices
permission to pair by holding them both at the same time
and thereby providing a transmission medium for intra-body
communication.
Two devices that do not share any secrets need to bootstrap
secure communication. The devices follow the pairing protocol
presented in Section V in order to agree on a mutual secret.
The decision whether two devices should be paired with
each other and execute the pairing protocol is made by a
human. A person can give the devices permission to run the
pairing protocol with each other by physically touching and
holding them both at the same time. Only if two devices are
held by the same person they are allowed to be paired with
each other. If a device is not connected with another device
through a person, or if a device is not being held by a person
at all, it should not be able to carry out the pairing process.
Our proposed device pairing scheme uses capacitive cou-
pling to establish the human body channel (“body channel”).
The devices each have an electrode that when touched by
a human enables communication through capacitive coupling.
