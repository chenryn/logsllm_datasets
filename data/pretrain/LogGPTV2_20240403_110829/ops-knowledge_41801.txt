User:  How to Set SSH Login Restrictions to Enhance Server Security?
Assistant: Setting SSH login restrictions can enhance the security of the server, which can be achieved in the following ways: 1. Configure the SSH firewall. Using a firewall can limit which IP addresses can connect to the SSH server, limit the number of connection attempts within a certain period of time, and prevent brute force cracking of passwords. 2. Use Key-Based Authentication, disable password login. Using private and public keys for authentication, rather than password authentication, makes the server more secure. 3. Forbid the root user to log in through SSH. In order to prevent hackers from using root privileges, close the ssh access of the root user on the server, and set up a non-root user to log in. 4. Use SSH port forwarding. The SSH port can be changed, making it difficult for hackers to locate the real SSH port. 5. Update and upgrade SSH software. Keep your servers safe by updating your SSH software in a timely manner to fix security holes.
