User: Does Apple accept Python applications for distribution on the new Mac App Store?
If so, how should the application be packaged? Is py2app sufficient? Something else?
Assistant: Apple provides the Build Applet tool for Python with Xcode so it should be supported by the App store. MacOS X 10.6.6 includes Python 2.5 and 2.6 as part of the default install, you can specify /usr/bin/python2.5 and /usr/lib/python2.5.
