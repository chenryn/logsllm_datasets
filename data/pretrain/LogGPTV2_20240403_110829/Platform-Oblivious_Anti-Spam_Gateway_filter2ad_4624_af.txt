bee colony and k-nearest neighbors [6], and P-value [47]. However,
the performance of all aforementioned approaches are unsatisfac-
tory, especially when applying to different platforms.
6 DISCUSSION
This work relies on the fact that the spam messages account for a
small portion in any social platform so that they can be exposed as
the outliers. This holds true for almost all social platforms, where
the existing anti-spam mechanisms have filtered the majority of
spam messages, leaving out only a small portion of spam mes-
sages to represent an even smaller fraction of messages that pass
anti-spam mechanism’s checking, as also affirmed by earlier re-
ports [1, 2, 41, 45]. This refers to the imbalanced data, where the
supervised methods typically encounter dilemma [29, 44, 52, 55]
when classifying the inside minority set (i.e., spam). Our work aims
to overcome this dilemma by proposing an effective unsupervised
solution, which can be integrated into the existing anti-spam mech-
anisms for further filtering spam messages.
Our solution can overcome the spammer feature drift problem
to some extent due to the following two design strategies. First,
we don’t rely on feature extraction from any labeled ground truth
dataset, and instead directly refine the spam and ham corpora ex-
isting in the target dataset. Second, for each word in the refined
spam and ham corpora, we embed it into a high dimensional vector,
which allows it to cover a richer set of words having similar syn-
tactic or semantic patterns. Even spammers evolve by substituting
some words with new ones in a spam, the resulting spam may still
yield a vector for successful detection as an outlier.
This work only focuses on the English-based social platforms. It
is interested for one platforms based on other languages, such as
Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and others, leaving as an open
problem for future pursuit. On the other hand, our work targets text-
only spam in linguistic-based social platforms. It is also necessary
to develop a platform-oblivious solution to detect malicious images
from social platforms like Facebook and Instagram, whereas the
images take a large portion. This line of research will be deferred
in our future work.
7 CONCLUSION
This paper has proposed a novel platform-oblivious spam detec-
tion framework that can work effectively across multiple social
platforms to expose spams’ outlier property for accurate spam de-
tection. With new solutions developed to mine the spam and ham
seed corpora from the target dataset and to reconstruct the refined
corpora as the references for distinguishing spams from hams, our
framework avoids reliance on laborious ground truth labeling and
has the potential of capturing the spammer feature drift. Through
employing the NLP and neural network models to train a spam
word model, the framework can identify the words with similar
semantic and syntactic information, without relying on the feature
extraction employed by all previous supervised learning methods.
It encodes all messages in the target dataset efficiently for effec-
tive processing by the outlier techniques to expose spams’ outlier
property. The results from extensive experiments demonstrate that
our solution can indeed expose the outlier characteristics of the
vast majority of spams. In addition, it is exhibited to outperform all
examined unsupervised methods and can better supervised counter-
parts, with its performance kept consistently superior when applied
to multiple platforms.
