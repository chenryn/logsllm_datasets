Spring 3.1 introduces several `@Enable*` annotations. However this code
snippet:
cannot be expressed with annotations. There is a valid simple workaround:
    @Bean
    public AnnotationMBeanExporter annotationMBeanExporter() {
        return new AnnotationMBeanExporter();
    }
but it would be nice to have built-in `@Enable...` annotation. Note that in
JavaConfig project there was `@MBeanExport` annotation.
