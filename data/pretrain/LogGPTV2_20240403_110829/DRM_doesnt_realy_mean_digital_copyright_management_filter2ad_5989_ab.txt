versions of the published material.  Similarly if a document exists 
in  many  archives  not  even  the  author  can  go  back  and  alter  the 
content without detection.  (In contrast, when there are improved 
results  or  clarifications  in  papers  on-line  then  the  publisher  or 
author can improve or correct in real time.  In a paper version the 
improvements  correspond  to  a  new  edition  number  or  revised 
publication.  Therefore after a claim becomes substantiated or an 
error  corrected,  referencing  functions  on  paper  can  fail  in  the 
digital network.) 
Mass  production  of  printed  material  (or  indeed  any  mass-
produced  analog  material)  and  distribution  of  the  material 
together create integrity in content.  Furthermore, when the mass 
production  includes  attribution  the  linkage  of  attribution  and 
content  is  strong.    The  linkage  of  attribution  to  content  is  used 
today [24] to enable an explicit reputation right.   
Related  to  integrity  is  the  issue  of  personal  annotations.    When 
alterations to the document are easy to detect, then annotations are 
clear.    While  it  is  possible  to  use  version  control  and  make 
annotations  clear  in  a  digital  document  such  a  result  requires 
explicit  design  effort.    In  contrast,  the  ability  to  make  personal 
annotations, including highlighting passages, marking pages, and 
adding comments in the margin, are integral to print technology. 
Personal  annotations  maintain  integrity  when  books  are  shared. 
The creation of individual, persistent annotations is trivial with a 
book  but  quite  difficult  with  digital  information.  Annotations, 
when shared, can be the basis for filtering and rating.   
Printed paper creates editions.  That is, each edition is better and 
more polished than the last.  Every edition offers confirmation of 
the  first  (in  comparison  with  decayed  individual  content).  
Editions identify dates, including first editions where there is no 
second.    Any  edition  can  be  referenced.    Before  the  press, 
referencing  required  copying  exact  material  with  context,  as  no 
audience  was  likely  to  be  able  to  check  an  original.    Page 
numbers, editions, and the ability to reference a work such that a 
distant colleague can validate my assertions are a function of the 
press.    Building  upon  the  innate  nature  of  the  press,  in  that  it 
produces identical copies identifiable at specific times and place, 
reference and review as used in modern scholarship were enabled. 
Annotated quotations, peer-review based orderings, and claims of 
previous  proven  foundation  via  reference  require  some  archival 
trusted information mechanism, integrity in documents including 
attribution, and some ordered manner to search the archive.  In the 
case of the printed book the page itself and the nature of repeated 
printings provide the possibility of this certainty.   
Now copyright is so deeply embedded into practice and thought 
that  its  success  makes  difficult  the  struggle  for  the  appropriate 
response to the new global shift in the technology and economics 
of information 
3.2  Legal 
Copyright  was  created  to  address  the  issue  of  ownership  and 
payment  in  a  media  that  was  relatively  cheap,  reasonably 
permanent, subject to references, straight-forward to archive and 
difficult to alterations without detectable trace.   
At its creation, copyright was essentially an extension of freedom 
of  communication,  in  that  it  replaced  the  Star  Chamber,  and 
fundamentally a mechanism for control, in that it required deposit 
in the Royal Library.  Before the Copyright Act the dual goals of 
regulation of press had been (often brutal) control of the content 
and  exercise  of  political  power  for  enrichment  of  the  powerful 
few.  First the printing guilds, then under the Stationers Act, the 
booksellers  (as  merchants  overtook  tradesmen  in  power),  and 
always the Crown controlled and profited.   
The Parliamentary refusal to renew the Stationer’s Act (at the first 
opportunity  of  Parliament  to  so  refuse)  resulted  in  a  collapse  of 
controls  on  licensing.    Unique  in  the  case  of  England  a  dual 
judicial system (the Star Chamber as well as the criminal and civil 
courts)  had  created  a  set  of  sometimes-incompatible  rulings.  
There was no single body of judicial findings on which to build.  
Printers  were  printing  and  selling  as  they  wished. 
  The 
information  market  was  not  functioning.    Even  the  most  ardent 
opponents  of  the  Stationers’  Act  recognized  the  need  for  some 
form of commercial structure.   
The  Copyright  Act  was,  “an  Act  for  the  encouragement  of 
Learning, by vesting the copies of printed books in the authors or 
purchasers  of  such  copies  during  the  times  therein  mentioned.” 
[22]. 
The Copyright Act was radical in the following aspects: 
(cid:31) 
 The  right  went  to  the  author,  not  to  printer,  bookseller  or 
Crown. 
(cid:31) 
 The  right  had  a  finite  term  (14  or  21  years).    Previously 
patents or privileges did not expire. 
(cid:31)  Violations  of  the  Act  were  civil  violations,  never  criminal 
violations.   
(cid:31)  Multiple depository requirements were created. 
Arguably the university depository requirements in the Copyright 
Act  were  not  entirely  radical. 
libraries  (Oxford, 
Cambridge,  Sion  College,  the  Royal  library,  four  unnamed 
Scottish Universities, and Edinburgh) were also notable in that the 
presses  of  the  Colleges  were  members  of  the  Stationers  Guild 
previously.  (S.  Anne, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, Section V.) 
  Those

Depository  laws  have  an  established  history,  dating  from  copy 
requirements  of  monarchs  seeking  to  build  personal/national 
libraries. [25]  (The division between a royal library and national 
one  is  difficult,  as  not  only  was  the  crown  the  state  but  also 
because  some  royal  libraries  were  open  to  scholars  while  some 
national libraries strictly limited access.) Yet depository laws very 
rarely  required  deposit  in  more  than  one  institution.    Thus  the 
depository requirement for the Royal library is in the traditional of 
depository  requirements  while  the  university  requirements  are 
something quantitatively and possibly qualitatively different. 
The  creation  of  the  right to own an expression created a market 
right.  It can be argued that the Copyright Act as signed by Queen 
Anne (thus becoming part of the Statute of Anne) did create the 
concept  of  fair  use,  requiring  nine  copies  of  each  book  so  that 
each of the major universities could each have a high quality copy 
available  in  their  libraries.    Yet  the  counter  argument,  based  on 
the role of libraries in the early eighteenth century argues against 
this interpretation, argues that fair use was a later construct.  What 
is  certain  is  that  the  requirements  for  deposit  simplified  the 
creation of scholarship.  The ordering of content for scholarship 
and debate was made possible by the printing press.

analog technology, see [6], [26]) 
3.3  Information Markets  
The effects of printing are so ubiquitous as to be invisible.  Again 
I  refer  the  reader  to  the  superior  histories  of the press and print 
noted at the beginning of this section.   
“Information wants to be free” as a phrase may have originated in 
Stewart  Brand’s  WELL  (Whole  earth  ‘Lectronic  Link)  but  the 
concept  was  instituted  (briefly,  and  as  a  notable  failure)  in 
revolutionary France.  [27] The licensing of the pre-Revolutionary 
regime of the resulted in excessively controlled debate resulting in 
a  degradation  of  dialogue  provided  by  the  underground.    In  the 
case of the French Revolutionary period the adoption of copyright 
followed a reign of completely free information.  In the records of 
the French revolution the popular political discourse suggests that 
an excessive control of information or a complete lack of control 
of information both result in a dysfunctional information market 
leading to all discourse plummeting to the pornographic: truly the 
lowest common denominator.  [27]  
Britain similarly suffered a dysfunctional market after the refusal 
to  renew  the  monopolistic  Stationer’s  Act.    In  Britain,  authors 
were  in  arms  and  publishers  had  difficulty  securing  copies  of 
works from abroad.  Printed paper, like other forms of information 
storage  and  transmission,  created  fundamental  problems  of 
economics and reliability of information.  Copyright solved these 
problems  for  the  printing  press  so  well  that  the  solution 
functioned with following analog mass-produced media. 
In  the  networked  digital  age  copying  is  costless.    Alteration  of 
documents  and  redistribution  is  trivial.  (I  recommend  primary 
sources for further discussion. [28], [29], [30])  
The digital network means that copying and distribution are now 
extremely low cost.  To distribute is now to copying, due to the 
inherent technology of digital reproduction. 
From  being  inexpensive  copying  has  become  nearly  free.  
Distribution costs have been reduced to almost nothing, a course 
of  affairs  which  will  continue  at  a  rate  surpassing  even  the

decrease in cost of computing power. [31]  Yet the functions of 
copy  accuracy  are  still  necessary:  production  can  be  expensive 
either monetarily for a Hollywood studio or in sweat of the brow 
from a single creator.  The simplification of misappropriation of 
goods  does  not  imply  that  such  a  state  of  affairs  creates  a 
functional market.   
A  related  issue  now  and  in  past  implementations  of  information 
technology 
  With 
widespread misappropriation, how does a reader know to trust the 
content, the attribution, or the consistency of a document? Paper 
addressed  surety  via  distribution,  archiving  and  technological 
determinism.    There  are  no  such  mechanisms  on  the  digital 
network. 
In  terms  of  the  function  of  copyright  there  are  two  further 
distinctions  between  paper  and  digital  information. 
  First, 
reputation  is  bound to paper.  Second, distribution is effectively 
archiving  in  a  paper  medium.    Third,  filtering  is  integrated  into 
publication. 
When an author’s name is added to a paper document removing it 
is  difficult,  and  leaves  traces  of  the  action.    The  author’s  name 
stays on a book: on the cover, the title page, sometimes even the 
pages.  It takes significant effort to convincingly alter authorship 
information  on  a  book  or  a  paper  and  redistribute.    In  contrast, 
maintaining author information is difficult in digital transmission, 
requiring the retransmission of an entire document and often even 
the  difficult  construction  of  the  context  of  the  document  (e.g., 
URL, author, date visited).

implement  them  using  write-once  optical  media  and  digital 
cryptography but the concept of a trusted third party is an ancient 
as  the  library  or  record-keeping  temple.    While  self-validating 
contracts were used for transactions that were critical only to the 
parties to the contract, third party validation was used for critical 
information.    The  earliest  libraries  were  temples  and  then  royal 
archives,  where  information  for  greater  social  importance  was 
stored.  The seat of government or the highest temple would hold 
the  canonical  document  and  copies  could  be  provided  to  those 
institutions lower in the hierarchy.  In this way there was a trusted 
third  party  where 
integrity  of 
information could be validated. [32] 
Distribution  is  archiving  in  paper  distribution.    Books  are 
distributed in a format that requires conscious decision to store or 
remove.  Storage is simplified with books.  Newspapers and books 
when  distributed  are  distributed  to  individuals  who  might  store 
them and to libraries that hold archives.  In contrast, distribution 
via  web  sites  requires  distribution 
that  are 
automatically  cleared.    Saving  requires  conscious  decision  and 
deleting  is  effortless.    Saving  with  contextual  information  for 
referencing  is  even  more  difficult.    The  critical  problem  of 
persistence is being addressed with great optimism but little result 
via the Web Consortium project the Semantic Web.  [33] 
Filtering  is  integrated  with  publishing,  distribution,  and  copying 
in the world of the printed page.  Editors choose the material to 
publish,  and  merchants  choose  which

The  issue  of  filtering  is  radically  different.    Herb  Simon  most 
famously  coined  the  concept  of  an  attention  span  economy.   As
