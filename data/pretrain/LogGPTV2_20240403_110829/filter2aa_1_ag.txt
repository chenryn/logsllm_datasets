    . There are two types of payment programs:
     vulnerability disclosure programs
     (VDPs)
    and
     bug bounty programs
    .
    你需要考虑的下一个指标是该计划的支付金额。有两种支付方案：漏洞披露计划（VDP）和漏洞赏金计划。
    VDPs are
     reputation-only programs
    , meaning they do not pay for findings but often offer rewards such as reputation points and swag. They are a great way to learn about hacking if making money is not your primary objective. Since they don’t pay, they’re less competitive, and so easier to find bugs in. You can use them to practice finding common vulnerabilities and communicating with security engineers.
    VDP是仅限声誉的计划，意味着它们不支付发现费用，但通常提供声誉点和赠品等奖励。如果赚钱不是您的主要目标，它们是学习黑客的绝佳方式。由于它们不支付，竞争性更弱，因此更容易发现漏洞。您可以使用它们来练习查找常见的漏洞并与安全工程师沟通。
    On the other hand, bug bounty programs offer varying amounts of monetary rewards for your findings. In general, the more severe the vulnerability, the more the report will pay. But different programs have different payout averages for each level of severity. You can find a program’s payout information on its bug bounty pages, usually listed in a section called the
     payout
    table. Typically, low-impact issues will pay anywhere from $50 to $500 (USD), while critical issues can pay upward of $10,000. However, the bug bounty industry is evolving, and payout amounts are increasing for high-impact bugs. For example, Apple now rewards up to $1 million for the most severe vulnerabilities.
    另一方面，漏洞赏金计划为您发现的漏洞提供不同金额的奖励。一般来说，漏洞越严重，报告所得的酬金就越高。但不同的计划对于不同严重程度的漏洞，有着不同的平均赔付标准。您可以在漏洞赏金页面上找到计划的赔付信息，通常是在一个称为赔付表的部分中列出。通常来说，低影响的问题可以获得50到500美元（美元）的奖励，而严重的问题可以获得超过10,000美元的奖励。然而，漏洞赏金行业正在发展，对于高影响漏洞的奖励金额也越来越高。例如，苹果现在可以为最严重的漏洞奖励高达100万美元。
    Response Time
    Finally, consider the program’s average
     response time
    . Some companies will handle and resolve your reports within a few days, while others take weeks or even months to finalize their fixes. Delays often happen because of the security team’s internal constraints, like a lack of personnel to handle reports, a delay in issuing security patches, and a lack of funds to timely reward researchers. Sometimes, delays happen because researchers have sent bad reports without clear reproduction steps.
    最后，请考虑该程序的平均响应时间。有些公司可以在几天内处理和解决您的报告，而另一些公司可能需要数周甚至数月才能完成修复。延迟通常是由于安全团队的内部限制引起的，比如缺乏处理报告的人员、发布安全补丁的延迟以及缺乏及时奖励研究人员的资金。有时，延迟是因为研究人员发送了没有明确重现步骤的错误报告。
    Prioritize programs with fast response times. Waiting for responses from companies can be a frustrating experience, and when you first start, you’re going to make a lot of mistakes. You might misjudge the severity of a bug, write an unclear explanation, or make technical mistakes in the report. Rapid feedback from security teams will help you improve, and turn you into a competent hacker faster.
    优先给速度响应快的项目排序。等待公司的回应可能会让你感到沮丧，特别是在你刚开始的时候，你会犯很多错误。你可能会错判一个漏洞的严重程度、写得不清楚或在报告中犯技术错误。安全团队的快速反馈将帮助你提高，并更快地成为一名合格的黑客。
    Private Programs
    Most bug bounty platforms distinguish between public and private programs.
    大部分漏洞赏金平台区分公开和私人项目。
     Public programs
    are those that are open to all; anyone can hack and submit bugs to these programs, as long as they abide by the laws and the bug bounty program’s policies.
    公共计划是对所有人开放的；只要遵守法律和漏洞赏金计划的政策，任何人都可以黑入并提交漏洞。
    On the other hand,
     private programs
    are open to only invited hackers. For these, companies ask hackers with a certain level of experience and a proven track record to attack the company and submit bugs to it. Private programs are a lot less competitive than public ones because of the limited number of hackers participating. Therefore, it’s much easier to find bugs in them. Private programs also often have a much faster response time, because they receive fewer reports on average.
    另一方面，私人计划仅向被邀请的黑客开放。对于这些私人计划，公司会邀请具有一定经验和已证明攻击该公司并提交错误的黑客。由于参与黑客的数量有限，私人计划的竞争要少得多。因此，在私人计划中更容易找到错误。私人计划通常也有更快的响应时间，因为它们平均接收到更少的错误报告。
    Participating in private programs can be extremely advantageous. But how do you get invited to one?
     Figure 1-1
    shows a private invitation notification on the HackerOne platform.
    参与私人计划可以非常有利。但是如何获得邀请呢？图1-1显示了HackerOne平台上的私人邀请通知。
       Figure 1-1
      : A private invitation notification on the HackerOne platform. When you hack on a bug bounty platform, you can often get invites to the private programs of different companies.
      图1-1：HackerOne平台上的私人邀请通知。当你在一个漏洞赏金平台上进行攻击时，你经常会收到来自不同公司私人计划的邀请。
    Companies send private invites to hackers who have proven their abilities in some way, so getting invites to private programs isn’t difficult once
    you’ve found a couple of bugs. Different bug bounty platforms will have different algorithms to determine who gets the invites, but here are some tips to help you get there.
    公司会向已经证明其能力的黑客发送私人邀请，因此一旦你发现了几个漏洞，获得私人计划的邀请并不困难。不同的漏洞赏金平台将有不同的算法来确定谁会获得邀请，但以下是一些提示，可帮助您实现该目标。
    First, submit a few bugs to public programs. To get private invites, you often need to gain a certain number of reputation points on a platform, and the only way to begin earning these is to submit valid bugs to public programs. You should also focus on submitting high-impact vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities will often reward you with higher reputation points and help you get private invites faster. In each of the chapters in
     Part II
    of this book, I make suggestions for how you can escalate the issues you discover to craft the highest-impact attacks. On some bug bounty platforms, like HackerOne, you can also get private invites by completing tutorials or solving Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges.
    首先，要提交一些针对公共程序的漏洞。要获得私人邀请，通常需要在平台上获得一定数量的声望点数，而开始获得这些点数的唯一方式就是提交有效的公共程序漏洞。你还应该专注于提交高影响漏洞。这些漏洞通常会奖励你更高的声望点数，并帮助你更快地获得私人邀请。在本书第二部分的每一章中，我都提出建议，让你能够升级你发现的问题，从而制定最高影响的攻击方法。在一些漏洞赏金平台上，比如HackerOne，你还可以通过完成教程或解决Capture the Flag（CTF）挑战来获得私人邀请。
    Next, don’t spam. Submitting nonissues often causes a decrease in reputation points. Most bug bounty platforms limit private invites to hackers with points above a certain threshold.
    接下来，禁止垃圾邮件。经常提交非问题会导致声誉点数下降。大多数漏洞赏金平台将私人邀请限制在具有一定门槛分数以上的黑客。
    Finally, be polite and courteous when communicating with security teams. Being rude or abusive to security teams will probably get you banned from the program and prevent you from getting private invites from other companies.
    在与安全团队交流时，请最终保持礼貌和谦恭。对安全团队粗鲁或滥用者将有可能导致您被禁止参加计划，并阻止您获得其他公司的私人邀请。
    Choosing the Right Program
    Bug bounties are a great way to gain experience in cybersecurity and earn extra bucks. But the industry has been getting more competitive. As more people are discovering these programs and getting involved in hacking on them, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for beginners to get started. That’s why it’s important to pick a program that you can succeed in from the very start.
    漏洞赏金计划是获得网络安全经验并赚取额外收入的绝佳途径。但是该行业变得越来越竞争。随着越来越多的人发现并参与其中，越来越难让初学者入手了。因此，选择一个能在一开始就成功的计划非常重要。
    Before you develop a bug hunter’s intuition, you often have to rely on low-hanging fruit and well-known techniques. This means many other hackers will be able to find the same bugs, often much faster than you can. It’s therefore a good idea to pick a program that more experienced bug hunters pass over to avoid competition. You can find these underpopulated programs in two ways: look for unpaid programs or go for programs with big scopes.
    在你拥有“虫子猎手”的直觉之前，你通常需要依赖易于发现的漏洞和众所周知的技巧。这意味着许多其他黑客可以更快地发现相同的漏洞，甚至比你还要快。因此，选择一些有经验的虫子猎手忽略的程序来避免竞争是个好主意。你可以通过两种方式找到这些少有人参与的程序：寻找未付费的计划或寻找范围大的计划。
    Try going for vulnerability disclosure programs first. Unpaid programs are often ignored by experienced bug hunters, since they don’t pay monetary rewards. But they still earn you points and recognition! And that recognition might be just what you need to get an invite to a private, paid program.
    试着先参加漏洞披露计划。有偿计划常常被经验丰富的漏洞猎人所重视，而无偿计划则常常被忽略。但是无偿计划依旧可以为您赢得积分和认可！并且可能正是这些认可让您获得邀请参加私人有偿计划的机会。
    Picking a program with a large scope means you’ll be able to look at a larger number of target applications and web pages. This dilutes the competition, as fewer hackers will report on any single asset or vulnerability type. Go for programs with fast response times to prevent frustration and get feedback as soon as possible.
    选择范围广的项目意味着您可以查看更多的目标应用程序和网页。这会稀释竞争，因为较少的黑客会报告任何单个资产或漏洞类型。选择响应速度快的程序以防止沮丧并尽快获取反馈。
    One last thing that you can incorporate into your decision process is the reputation of the program. If you can, gather information about a
    company’s process through its disclosed reports and learn from other hackers’ experiences. Does the company treat its reporters well? Are they respectful and supportive? Do they help you learn? Pick programs that will be supportive while you are still learning, and programs that will reward you for the value that you provide.
    你决策过程中还需要考虑的一件事是项目的声誉。如果可以，通过公开报告收集关于公司的信息，并从其他黑客的经验中学习。公司是否公正尊重举报人？他们是否支持举报人学习？选择那些在你学习时能够提供支持和为你提供价值回报的项目。
    Choosing the right program for your skill set is crucial if you want to break into the world of bug bounties. This chapter should have helped you sort out the various programs that you might be interested in. Happy hacking!
    选择适合你技能的程序非常关键，如果想要进入漏洞赏金的世界。本章应该帮助你筛选出你可能感兴趣的各种程序。祝你愉快的黑客之旅！

      Sustaining Your Success
    Even if you understand the technical information in this book, you may have difficulty navigating the nuances of bug bounty programs. Or you might be struggling to actually locate legitimate bugs and aren’t sure why you’re stuck. In this chapter, we’ll explore some of the factors that go into making a successful bug bounty hunter. We’ll cover how to write a report that properly describes your findings to the security team, build lasting relationships with the organizations you work with, and overcome obstacles during your search for bugs.
    即使您理解了本书中的技术信息，您可能会在利用漏洞赏金计划的微妙之处方面遇到困难。或者您可能正在努力实际定位合法漏洞，却不确定为什么会陷入困境。在本章中，我们将探讨成功的漏洞赏金猎人所需要具备的一些因素。我们将介绍如何编写报告，将您的发现正确地描述给安全团队，与您合作的组织建立持久的关系，并在寻找漏洞的过程中克服障碍。
    Writing a Good Report
    A bug bounty hunter’s job isn’t just finding vulnerabilities; it’s also explaining them to the organization’s security team. If you provide a well-written report, you’ll help the team you’re working with reproduce the exploit, assign it to the appropriate internal engineering team, and fix the issue faster. The faster a vulnerability is fixed, the less likely malicious hackers are to exploit it. In this section, I’ll break down the components of a good vulnerability report and introduce some tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way.
    一个漏洞赏金猎人的工作不仅是寻找漏洞，而且还需要向组织的安全团队解释它们。如果您提供一个写得很好的报告，您将帮助您正在与之合作的团队重现漏洞、将其分配给适当的内部工程团队并更快地修复问题。漏洞被解决得越快，恶意黑客利用漏洞的可能性就越小。在本节中，我将分解一个好的漏洞报告的组成部分，并介绍我学到的一些技巧和诀窍。
    Step 1: Craft a Descriptive Title
    The first part of a great vulnerability report is always a descriptive title. Aim for a title that sums up the issue in one sentence. Ideally, it should allow the security team to immediately get an idea of what the vulnerability is, where it occurred, and its potential severity. To do so, it should answer the following questions: What is the vulnerability you’ve found? Is it an instance of a well-known vulnerability type, such as IDOR or XSS? Where did you find it on the target application?
    一份良好的漏洞报告的第一部分总是一个描述性的标题。标题应该简洁概括问题，并尽可能的让安全团队立刻明确漏洞所在，其影响和潜在程度。为了做到这一点，它应该回答以下问题：你发现的漏洞是什么？它是否属于IDOR或XSS等已知漏洞类型？在目标应用程序的哪里发现它？
    For example, instead of a report title like “IDOR on a Critical Endpoint,” use one like “IDOR on
     https://example.com/change_password
    Leads to Account Takeover for All Users.” Your goal is to give the security engineer reading your report a good idea of the content you’ll discuss in the rest of it.
    例如，可以使用“https://example.com/change_password上的IDOR导致所有用户的账户接管”这样的报告标题，而非“关键端点上的IDOR”。您的目标是让阅读报告的安全工程师对您接下来要讨论的内容有一个良好的了解。
    Step 2: Provide a Clear Summary
    Next, provide a report summary. This section includes all the relevant details you weren’t able to communicate in the title, like the HTTP request parameters used for the attack, how you found it, and so on.
    接下来，提供报告摘要。此部分包括所有相关的细节，您在标题中无法传达，比如用于攻击的HTTP请求参数，您是如何发现它的等等。
    Here’s an example of an effective report summary:
    以下是一份有效报告摘要的例子：
     The
      https://example.com/change_password
     endpoint takes two POST body parameters:
      user_id
     and
      new_password
     . A POST request to this endpoint would change the password of user
      user_id
     to
      new_password
     . This endpoint is not validating the
      user_id
     parameter, and as a result, any user can change anyone else’s password by manipulating the
      user_id
     parameter.
     https://example.com/change_password端点需要两个POST请求体参数：user_id和new_password。对此端点的POST请求将把用户user_id的密码更改为new_password。此端点未验证user_id参数，因此任何用户都可以通过操作user_id参数来更改其他任何人的密码。
    A good report summary is clear and concise. It contains all the information needed to understand a vulnerability, including what the bug is, where the bug is found, and what an attacker can do when it’s exploited.
    一个好的报告摘要应该清晰简明。它包含了理解某个漏洞所需的所有信息：包括bug是什么，它在哪里被发现，以及攻击者在利用该漏洞时会做些什么。
    Step 3: Include a Severity Assessment
    Your report should also include an honest assessment of the bug’s severity. In addition to working with you to fix vulnerabilities, security teams have other responsibilities to tend to. Including a severity assessment will help them prioritize which vulnerabilities to fix first, and ensure that they take care of critical vulnerabilities right away.
    你的报告还应包括漏洞的严重程度诚恳的评估。除了与你合作修复漏洞外，安全团队还有其他职责需要注意。包括漏洞严重性评估将有助于他们优先处理哪些漏洞，并确保立即处理重要漏洞。
    You could use the following scale to communicate severity:
    您可以使用以下标尺来沟通严重程度：
     Low severity
    低严重性
    The bug doesn’t have the potential to cause a lot of damage. For example, an open redirect that can be used only for phishing is a low-severity bug.
    这个漏洞没有潜在的能力造成很大的损害。例如，只能用于网络钓鱼的开放重定向是低严重性漏洞。
     Medium severity
    中等严重性
    The bug impacts users or the organization in a moderate way, or is a high-severity issue that’s difficult for a malicious hacker to exploit. The security team should focus on high- and critical-severity bugs first. For example, a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) on a sensitive action such as password change is often considered a medium-severity issue.
    漏洞对用户或组织的影响较为中等，或者是一个高严重性问题，不易被恶意黑客利用。安全团队应该首先关注高和严重的漏洞。例如，对于敏感操作（如密码更改）的跨站点请求伪造（CSRF）通常被视为中等严重性问题。
     High severity
    高严重性
    The bug impacts a large number of users, and its consequences can be disastrous for these users. The security team should fix a high-security bug as soon as possible. For example, an open redirect that can be used to steal OAuth tokens is a high-severity bug.
    该漏洞影响大量用户，其后果可能对这些用户造成灾难性的影响。安全团队应该尽快修复高安全性漏洞。例如，一个可用于窃取OAuth令牌的开放重定向是一种高危漏洞。
     Critical severity
    重要性严重
    The bug impacts a majority of the user base or endangers the organization’s core infrastructure. The security team should fix a critical-severity bug right away. For example, a SQL injection leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the production server will be considered a critical issue.
    Bug影响到大多数用户或危及组织的核心基础设施。安全团队应立即修复关键性缺陷。例如，在生产服务器上导致远程代码执行（RCE）的SQL注入将被视为关键问题。
    Study the
     Common Vulnerability Scoring System
     (
     CVSS
     )
    at
     https://www.first.org/cvss/
    for a general idea of how critical each type of vulnerability is. The CVSS scale takes into account factors such as how a vulnerability impacts an organization, how hard the vulnerability is to exploit, and whether the vulnerability requires any special privileges or user interaction to exploit.
    学习通用漏洞评分系统（CVSS）https://www.first.org/cvss/ 以了解每种漏洞的严重程度。CVSS评分考虑了漏洞对组织的影响、漏洞的利用难度以及漏洞是否需要特殊权限或用户交互才能利用等因素。
    Then, try to imagine what your client company cares about, and which vulnerabilities would present the biggest business impact. Customize your assessment to fit the client’s business priorities. For example, a dating site might find a bug that exposes a user’s birth date as inconsequential, since a user’s age is already public information on the site, while a job search site might find a similar bug significant, because an applicant’s age should be confidential in the job search process. On the other hand, leaks of users’ banking information are almost always considered a high-severity issue.
    那么，试着想象一下你的客户公司关心什么，以及哪些漏洞可能会对业务产生最大的影响。将您的评估定制以适应客户的业务优先级。例如，约会网站可能会发现暴露用户出生日期的漏洞并不重要，因为用户的年龄已经是公共信息，而求职网站可能会发现类似的漏洞非常重要，因为申请人的年龄应该在求职过程中保密。另一方面，用户银行信息的泄露几乎总是被认为是高度严重的问题。
    If you’re unsure which severity rating your bug falls into, use the rating scale of a bug bounty platform. For example, Bugcrowd’s rating system takes into account the type of vulnerability and the affected functionality (
     https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy/
    ), and HackerOne provides a severity calculator based on the CVSS scale (
     https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/severity.html
    ).
    如果您不确定您的漏洞属于哪个严重级别，请使用漏洞赏金平台的评级标准。例如，Bugcrowd的评估系统考虑到漏洞类型和受影响的功能（https://bugcrowd.com/vulnerability-rating-taxonomy/），而HackerOne则基于CVSS标准提供了一个严重性计算器（https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/severity.html）。
    You could list the severity in a single line, as follows:
    你可以将严重程度列在单行中，如下所示：
