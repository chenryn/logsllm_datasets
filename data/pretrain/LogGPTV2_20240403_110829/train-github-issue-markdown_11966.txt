Hello Everyone!
I was wondering if it would be possible to implement a method so that users
who develop Electron-based apps could bundle their applications with the
electron executable as to help obscure their source code further.
As it currently stands, it's rather simple for someone to obtain the source
code of your application regardless of whether or not you bundle it into an
.asar file.
Although not entirely secure, as it currently stands NW.JS has a method for
bundling their .nw files (which is basically a ZIP File renamed) with their
executable. I can't quite remember exactly how it was done (because it's been
a while since I've used electron or nw.js), but I explain it briefly in this
other Github post for Electron-packager.
electron/electron-packager#152
Here is the command line tool for bundling .nw files into an executable with
Node-Webkit
    copy /B nw.exe+app.nw app.exe
The only issue with this is that even if electron adopted this kind of method
it would still not be entirely secure. There are still ways that you could get
the source code.
The only way I see this working is if someone built a tool to create a custom
version of electron that had a sort of encryption key in it that would decrypt
the .asar file and run it's contents that way. Because other than that I see
no other way of doing this..
Any suggestions?
If I've missed something, please let me know. I'm just getting back into
electron after a long while of doing other things.
Thanks
