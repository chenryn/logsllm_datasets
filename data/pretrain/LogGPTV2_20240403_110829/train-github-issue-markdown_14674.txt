On Alpine Linux, a minimalist Linux distribution, some of NumPy's tests are failing. The log file `log.txt` is attached for reference.

There are two primary issues identified:

1. **Missed Overflow/Underflow Exceptions**: These occur due to missing overflow and underflow exceptions.
2. **Incorrect Results from Trigonometric Functions**: These are caused by inaccuracies in the trigonometric functions provided by musl.

### Proposed Solutions

#### 1. Missed Overflow/Underflow Exceptions
To address this issue, including the `fenv.h` header in musl builds can help. This can be done by modifying the following files:
- `numpy/numpy/core/src/npymath/ieee754.c.src`
- `numpy/core/include/numpy/ufuncobject.h`

In these files, the `__GLIBC__` macro should be replaced with `__GNUC__`.

#### 2. Incorrect Trigonometric Function Results
To fix the incorrect results from trigonometric functions, we need to disable these functions in `numpy/numpy/core/src/private/npy_config.h` not only for glibc but also for musl. However, musl does not provide a macro like `__GLIBC__` to detect it.

### Implementation Considerations

Given the above, the question is whether the NumPy project is interested in such a patch. If so, what would be the best way to implement it?

If the NumPy project is not interested, the patch could be implemented in the corresponding package for Alpine Linux.

We welcome your feedback on the best approach to resolve these issues.

Thank you.
