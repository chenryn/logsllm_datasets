On AlpineLinux, which is a mil based Linux distributive, some of numpy's test
fail. The log is attached.  
log.txt
There are two types of issues - one for various missed overflow/underflow
exceptions, the second one is for incorrect results from musl's trigonometric
functions.
The first one can be fixed by including `fenv.h` header in musl builds, AFAIU
this can be done in `numpy/numpy/core/src/npymath/ieee754.c.src` and
`numpy/core/include/numpy/ufuncobject.h ` by replacing `__GLIBC__` with
`__GNUC__`
The second group can be fixed by disabling the trigonometric functions in
`numpy/numpy/core/src/private/npy_config.h` not only for glibc, but also for
musl. An issue here is that musl doesn't provide any macro like the
`__GLIBC__` to detect it.
So the question, is numpy interested in such a patch? Could you please share
your opinions what is best way to implement it?
Otherwise the patch can be implement in corresponding package for AlpineLinux
