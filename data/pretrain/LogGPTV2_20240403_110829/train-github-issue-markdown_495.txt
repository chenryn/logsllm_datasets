# Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

Users should be able to load custom Terminal settings from their OneDrive folder or a personal GitHub repository, similar to how they can do this for PowerShell and VIM settings. Currently, when logging into a new machine, users must manually merge or copy Terminal settings, which is not required for PowerShell or VIM, as those settings can be easily cloned from a Git repository and redirected to the appropriate settings folder.

# Proposed Technical Implementation Details (Optional)

To achieve this, we propose the following options:

1. **Arbitrary Folder Configuration:**
   - Allow users to specify an arbitrary folder from which the Terminal will read its settings. This could be a local path, a OneDrive folder, or a directory within a GitHub repository.
   - The user would configure the path in the Terminal settings, and the Terminal would automatically load the settings from the specified location upon startup.

2. **Default `.terminal` Folder with Redirection:**
   - By default, the Terminal could look for settings in a `~/.terminal` folder.
   - Users would have the option to redirect this folder to another location, such as a OneDrive folder or a GitHub repository.
   - Once the redirection is configured, the Terminal would read the settings from the new location, restoring all user-defined settings and profiles.

By implementing either of these options, users would be able to seamlessly manage and apply their Terminal settings across multiple machines, enhancing their overall experience and productivity.
