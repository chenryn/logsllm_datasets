## Abstract
We address the problem of inferring link loss rates using passive measurements. Prior inference approaches primarily rely on the time correlation nature of packet losses. However, passive inference has limited control over the measurement process, making it challenging to adapt loss rate inference to the impact of time correlation. We propose a new loss model that expresses an inferred link loss rate as a function of time correlation. Under this model, we demonstrate its identifiability and propose a novel profile-likelihood-based inference approach that can accurately infer link loss rates for various complex topologies (e.g., trees with many leaf branches). We validate the accuracy of our approach through both model and network simulations.

## I. Introduction
Network loss tomography is a critical technique for estimating internal loss rates of network elements using external traffic measurements. This enables network operators to diagnose performance bottlenecks during high traffic loads and optimize resource provisioning and network planning. Traditional loss rate inference methods use active probing, which sends probes either via multicast or unicast to obtain end-to-end measurements. Unicast-based active probing is more practical due to the limited support for multicast in most Internet routers. These methods leverage the time correlation of packet losses, where neighboring packets often experience similar loss behavior on common nodes/links.

However, active probing introduces overhead and requires collaboration between senders and receivers. Therefore, passive network tomography, which monitors existing traffic without generating additional traffic, is an attractive alternative. Like unicast-based active probing, passive tomography also relies on the time correlation of packet losses. 

Despite its advantages, passive tomography has limited control over the measurement process, leading to potential degradation in inference accuracy. Time correlation in packet losses is imperfect, and while active probing can mitigate this by using probe stripes, such solutions are not feasible in passive approaches. It is expected that as the time difference between back-to-back packets increases, their time correlation will decay. However, modeling this decaying property in passive loss rate inference remains a challenge.

In this paper, we propose a passive loss rate inference approach that accounts for different functional forms of time correlation in packet losses. We first model the inferred link loss rate as a function of time correlation. Under this model, we develop a profile-likelihood (PL)-based inference approach, which allows us to focus on the parameters of interest (i.e., link loss rates) by replacing other nuisance unknowns with appropriate estimates. Our approach is applicable in existing passive network measurement systems and enhances inference accuracy.

To further motivate the importance of accurate passive loss rate inference, we consider a commercial network traffic analysis system that passively captures IP traffic in a wireless data network. The system monitors the performance of underlying network links and elements. Figure 1 illustrates a simplified view of a wireless data network and the deployment of the analysis system. The network has a hierarchical structure, with the analysis system observing IP traffic at a Home Agent/Foreign Agent (HA/FA) tap point connected to multiple base station controllers (BSCs), each of which is connected to multiple base stations (BSes). Given the uneven distribution of traffic workload, we include statistically efficient extensions into our baseline PL-based inference approach to handle "many-branch" topologies with uneven traffic loads.

In summary, our contributions are:
- Development of a loss model that expresses loss rates as a function of time correlation.
- Consideration of different functional forms of time correlation and demonstration of the model's identifiability.
- Development of a PL-based inference approach that provides accurate estimates of link loss rates.
- Extension of the PL-based inference approach for general topologies, including those with a high degree of branch links and multi-level topologies.
- Validation of the inference algorithm through extensive model and network simulations.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the TCP-based passive measurement framework. Section III models time correlation in loss inference and discusses identifiability issues. Section IV proposes our PL-based inference approach, and Section V discusses extensions for general topologies. Sections VI and VII validate our approach via model and network simulations, respectively. Related work is discussed in Section VIII, and we conclude in Section IX.

## II. Passive Measurements Through TCP Inference
We introduce a basic TCP-based passive measurement framework for our inference approach. Figure 2 depicts the framework, which observes sender-to-receiver TCP data packets and receiver-to-sender acknowledgments (ACKs) at a measurement point. The framework identifies whether each packet is delivered or lost based on the TCP retransmission mechanism. While retransmissions can also be triggered by spurious timeouts or ACK losses, more robust approaches exist for inferring TCP packet losses.

Our focus is not on determining TCP packet losses but on leveraging the current passive inference frameworks to enhance the accuracy of network loss tomography. We assume that we can correctly determine whether a TCP packet is lost and use this end-to-end information as input to our inference approach.

Figure 2 shows a two-level tree topology, where TCP packets traverse a common link and reach one of the K leaf branches. We collect packet samples at the root node and infer the loss rate of the common link. While we focus on link losses, the methodology is also applicable to node losses. In Section V, we explain how to extend our approach for general topologies. We expect this type of loss rate inference to be deployed in a network administered by a single authority, so topological information is available.

The framework monitors a stream of TCP packets and ACKs over a measurement epoch. For each packet sample, the framework records the arrival timestamp, the index of the leaf branch, and whether the packet is lost. This information is used to generate packet pairs, which, along with single packet samples, serve as inputs to our inference approach.

## III. Packet Pair Loss Modeling
In this section, we define packet pairs and present our loss model. Our goal is to use these packet pair measurements, together with single packet measurements, to estimate link success (or loss) rates. We demonstrate that our model parameters are statistically identifiable and justify how the perfect correlation assumption can introduce bias.

### A. Packet Pair
We use the two-level tree topology in Figure 2 for our discussion. A packet pair is defined as neighboring packets with inter-arrival time less than δ, where δ is a tunable parameter, and destined for different leaf branches. This definition is more restricted than in [11], where all packet pairs, regardless of the branch, are considered. We show later that these restrictions enable us to use a smaller set of model parameters, simplifying our loss rate estimation.

### B. Loss Model
Let (U, V) be a packet pair, where U and V represent the first and second packets, respectively. We model the loss correlation between U and V.

As the packet pair (U, V) is destined for different leaf branches, we can define the sub-path before the divergence of their paths as the common link and the paths after the divergence as new leaf links. This forms a tree topology with two leaves. To simplify our discussion, we consider a two-level, two-leaf tree topology (i.e., K = 2) to explain our model.

Let packet U be represented by a tuple (u, Yu, tu), where u = 1, 2 is the leaf index, Yu is the event variable that equals 1 if the packet is received by the leaf branch (i.e., successful) or 0 otherwise, and tu is the arrival timestamp observed at the measurement point. Similarly, we use tuple (v, Yv, tv) to represent packet V. Thus, we can decompose Yu and Yv as:
\[ Yu = Zu \cdot Xu \]
\[ Yv = Zv \cdot Xv \]
where Zu (resp. Zv) is the event variable that equals 1 if packet U (resp. V) is successful on the common link and 0 otherwise, and Xu (resp. Xv) is the event variable that equals 1 if packet U (resp. V) is successful at the leaf link and 0 otherwise.

We assume that loss events on different links are independent, i.e., Xu and Xv are independent events and both are independent of the events Zu and Zv at the common link. The assumption of link independence does not strictly hold in general, but the correlation of links is weak and has limited impact on our analysis. Since Zu and Zv are events at the common link, they are correlated. Let Δu = tv - tu be the difference of the arrival timestamps of the packet pair. We assume that the success (and loss) events at the common link form a stationary process with some correlation function ρa(·), where a represents an unknown parameter:
\[ \text{Correlation}(Zu, Zv) = \rho_a(\Delta_u) \]
where 0 ≤ ρa(·) ≤ 1. It is reasonable to expect that ρa(·) is a monotonically decreasing function, ρa(0) = 1, and ρa(Δu) → 0 as Δu goes to infinity.

Let p be the packet success rate at the common link, and p1 and p2 be the link success rates of leaf nodes 1 and 2, respectively. Let sd(.) denote the standard deviation function, and let Cov(.) denote the covariance function. Then:
\[ \text{Cov}(Zu, Zv) = \text{sd}(Zu) \cdot \text{sd}(Zv) \cdot \rho_a(\Delta_u) = p(1 - p) \rho_a(\Delta_u) \]
Using the above, we can show:
\[ \text{Cov}(Yu, Yv) = p(1 - p)p1p2 \rho_a(\Delta_u) \]

Suppose we define four possible probabilities of success/failure events of the packet as follows:
\[ r_{kl}(U, V) = P(Yu = k, Yv = l), \quad k, l \in \{0, 1\} \]
It is easy to show:
\[ r_{11}(U, V) = pp1p2(p + (1 - p) \rho_a(\Delta_u)) \]
\[ r_{10}(U, V) = pp1 - r_{11} \]
\[ r_{01}(U, V) = pp2 - r_{11} \]
\[ r_{00}(U, V) = 1 + r_{11} - pp1 - pp2 \]

### C. Modeling Time Correlation
Since the exact form of the time correlation function is generally unknown, we consider approximations when Δ is close to zero. We consider the following specific approximations:
\[ \rho_a(\Delta) \approx 1 - a \Delta \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq \Delta < \delta \]
\[ \rho_a(\Delta) \approx e^{-a \Delta} \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq \Delta < \delta \]
where a > 0 is an unknown parameter to be estimated. These approximations are good enough to capture the time-decaying property of the exact form of ρa(·).

When a = 0, the approximations include the special case of perfect correlation:
\[ \rho_a(\Delta) = 1 \quad \text{(perfect correlation)} \]
which implies that both packets in the packet pair always have the same success/loss events. However, assuming perfect correlation when it is not true introduces bias in the estimates.

### D. Identifiability
We show that our loss model is identifiable as long as the correlation is not a constant other than 1. Let ρ = Cor(Zu, Zv) ≤ 1, where (Zu, Zv) are the unobserved successful events on the common link in the two-leaf tree. As N → ∞, the estimate of p in (9) has an asymptotic bias:
\[ \text{Bias}(\hat{p}) = \hat{p} - p \rightarrow \frac{p(1 - p)(1 - \rho)}{p + (1 - p)\rho} \]
Thus, the relative bias for loss rate (1 - p) is:
\[ \text{Relative Bias} = \frac{\text{Bias}(\hat{p})}{1 - p} \]

## IV. Profile-Likelihood-Based Inference Approach
Under the loss model with time correlation, we develop a PL-based inference approach. The PL method allows us to focus on the parameters of interest (i.e., link loss rates) by replacing other nuisance unknowns with appropriate estimates. Our approach is applicable in existing passive network measurement systems and enhances inference accuracy.

## V. Extensions for General Topologies
We extend our PL-based inference approach for more general topologies, including those with a high degree of branch links and multi-level topologies. We discuss how to handle these topologies and provide examples.

## VI. Model Simulations
We validate the accuracy of our inference algorithm through extensive model simulations in R. The results show that our approach provides accurate estimates of link loss rates.

## VII. Network Simulations
We further validate our approach through network simulations in ns2. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios.

## VIII. Related Work

## IX. Conclusion
