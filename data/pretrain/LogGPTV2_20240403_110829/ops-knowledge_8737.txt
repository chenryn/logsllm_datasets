User: So, I'm learning Python and would like to create a simple script to download a file from the internet and then write it to a file. However, I am using IDLE and have no idea what the working directory is in IDLE or how to change it. How can I do file system stuff in IDLE if I don't know the working directory or how to change it?
Assistant: This will depend on OS and how IDLE is executed.
To change the (default) CWD in Windows, right click on the Short-cut Icon, go to "Properties" and change "Start In".
