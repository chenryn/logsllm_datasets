User: I'm debugging my Python code in Eclipse using the Pydev plugin. I'm able to open a Pydev console and it gives me two options: "Console for currently active editor" and "Python console". However none of them is useful to inspect current variable status after a breakpoint.
For example, the code stopped at a breakpoint and I want to inspect an "action" variable using the console. However my variables are not available. How can I do things like "dir(action)", etc? (even if it is not using a console).
Assistant: Double click on "action" or any other variable.
ctrl+shift+D
And if you're using watches, I cant imagine better interaction. You are able to see every change.
