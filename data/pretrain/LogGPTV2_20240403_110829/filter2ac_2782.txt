**Title: Black Hat US-18: Identity Theft: Attacks on SSO Systems**

**Abstract:**

In today's organizations, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) often serves as the trust anchor for Single Sign-On (SSO) systems. This presentation will delve into a newly discovered vulnerability that has affected multiple independent SAML implementations and, more broadly, any systems that rely on the security of XML signatures. The research uncovered issues in several libraries, which are foundational to many SSO systems.

**Root Cause:**

The core issue stems from the way various SAML implementations traverse the XML Document Object Model (DOM) after validating signatures. This vulnerability allows an attacker to tamper with signed XML documents, altering attributes such as the authenticating user, without invalidating the signatures over these attributes. Consequently, an attacker with authenticated access to a SAML Identity Provider can gain access to services as a different user, often more easily than one might expect.

**Additional Vulnerabilities:**

The talk will also cover another class of vulnerabilities found in user directories. These vulnerabilities not only amplify the impact of the previously mentioned SAML flaw but, in some cases, can independently enable authentication bypasses. 

By addressing both the SAML implementation and user directory vulnerabilities, this presentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the risks and potential mitigations for identity theft in SSO systems.
