According to Tensorflow 2.0, many important functions are deprecated, such as:  
tf.layers.dense()  
tf.layers.dropout()  
tf.layers.flatten()  
tf.layers.batch_normalization()  
...  
Since these functions are very widely used, and also very helpful for building
complicted models, would you please keep them in the future versions?
