In TensorFlow 2.0, several important functions have been deprecated, including:

- `tf.layers.dense()`
- `tf.layers.dropout()`
- `tf.layers.flatten()`
- `tf.layers.batch_normalization()`

These functions are widely used and play a crucial role in building complex models. Given their importance, I would like to request that these functions be retained in future versions of TensorFlow. 

Alternatively, if the deprecation is necessary, could you provide clear and comprehensive migration guides to help users transition smoothly to the new APIs? This would ensure that the community can continue to develop and maintain their models effectively.
