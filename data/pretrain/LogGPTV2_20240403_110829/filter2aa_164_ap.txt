### Controlling Your Raspbmc Box

#### Step 1: Choose Your Control Method
First, decide whether you want to control your Raspbmc box via Internet Protocol (IP) or Infrared (IR).

- **IP Control**: An example of an IP-powered remote control is an iOS or Android app that allows you to manage your Raspbmc media center.
- **IR Control**: IR is a line-of-sight remote control protocol, commonly used for controlling devices like televisions.

#### Step 2: Setting Up IP Remote Control
If you choose the IP remote control route, consider using mobile apps designed to control XBMC over your local IP network:

- **Official XBMC Remote (Android)**: [Download](http://is.gd/k4UeWY)
- **Official XBMC Remote (iOS)**: [Download](http://is.gd/qZkt3l)

##### Task: Controlling Your Raspbmc Box from iOS

1. **Enable Remote Control in XBMC**:
   - Navigate to `System > Settings > Services > Remote Control`.
   - Enable `Allow programs on other systems to control XBMC`.

2. **Enable Zeroconf**:
   - On the same configuration page, navigate to `Zeroconf` and enable `Announce these services to other systems via Zeroconf`.
   - For more information on Zeroconf, see the note "What is Zeroconf?".

3. **Configure Webserver Settings**:
   - Navigate to `System > Settings > Services > Webserver`.
   - Ensure `Allow Control of XBMC via HTTP` is enabled.
   - Optionally change the listener port (8080 is a good choice) and add a username and password (e.g., `xbmc/xbmc`).

4. **Verify Your IP Address**:
   - Go back to the home page, navigate to `System > System Info`, and check the `IP address` field.

5. **Install the Official XBMC Remote App**:
   - Download and install the `Official XBMC Remote` from the App Store.

6. **Add Host in the App**:
   - Start the app and tap `Add Host`.
   - In the `New XBMC Server` dialog box, add as many details as possible regarding your Raspbmc (see Figure 12.6).

7. **Save and Find XBMC**:
   - Tap `Save` to save your configuration.
   - Tap `Find XBMC` to locate your device on the network.

With a successful connection, you can fully control your Raspbmc box remotely (see Figures 12.7 and 12.8).

#### Step 3: Setting Up IR Remote Control
If you prefer IR control, you can use your existing hardware remote. Alternatively, you can set up a GPIO-based IR receiver.

##### Task: Configuring a GPIO-based IR Receiver

1. **Purchase Required Parts**:
   - **TSOP38238 IR Receiver**: [Link](http://is.gd/y9XzOC)
   - **Female-to-female Jumper Wires**: [Link](http://is.gd/anFo27)
   - **Mini Remote Control**: [Link](http://is.gd/dp0mPW)

2. **Connect the IR Receiver**:
   - Connect three female-to-female jumper wires to the three leads of the IR receiver and three GPIO pins (see Figure 12.10).
   - **IR receiver pin #1 to GPIO pin #18 (data)**
   - **IR receiver pin #2 to GPIO pin GND (ground)**
   - **IR receiver pin #3 to GPIO pin 3V3 (3.3V power)**

3. **Configure LIRC**:
   - Log into XBMC on your Raspberry Pi and navigate to `Programs > Raspbmc Settings > IR Remote`.
   - Disable `Enable GPIO TSOP IR Receiver` while testing the hardware remote.
   - When ready, enable it and make a note of your Raspbmcâ€™s IP address.

4. **Linux Command Line Configuration**:
   - Use SSH to connect to your Raspbmc box. The default username is `pi`, and the default password is `raspberry`.
   - Refer to the Adafruit tutorial for detailed instructions: [Using an IR Remote with a Raspberry Pi Media Center](http://is.gd/97RvGt).

### Transferring Content to Your Pi

You can upload media files (movies, TV shows, music, pictures, etc.) to your Raspberry Pi using File Transfer Protocol (FTP). We recommend the freeware FileZilla for Windows and Mac users.

##### Task: Uploading Media Content to Raspberry Pi

1. **Start FileZilla and Fill in Details**:
   - **Host**: Your Raspbmc's IP address
   - **Username**: `pi`
   - **Password**: `raspberry`
   - **Port**: Leave empty (default is TCP port 21).

2. **Create Directories**:
   - Right-click in the Remote site window and create the following folders:
     - `Movies`
     - `TV`
     - `Music`
     - `Pictures`

3. **Transfer Files**:
   - Drag and drop the file(s) from your local system to the appropriate destination in the Remote site pane.
   - Monitor progress in the bottom pane of FileZilla.

### Scraping Your Media

Media scrapers in XBMC can detect, analyze, and report metadata for your media files. Properly named files help scrapers work more efficiently.

##### Task: Configuring XBMC Media Detection

1. **Navigate to Video Library**:
   - In XBMC, go to `Video > Files`.

2. **Add Video Source**:
   - Click `Files > Add Videos...`.
   - Click `Browse` and select your target directory (e.g., `/home/pi/tv`).

3. **Set Content Type**:
   - In the `Set Content` dialog box, set `This Directory Contains` to your desired media type (e.g., `TV shows`).

4. **Choose a Scraper**:
   - Select a default scraper or click `Get More` to browse for an alternate choice (see Figure 12.13).

5. **Scan and Access Library**:
   - Click `OK` to perform a full scan.
   - Access your library from the Home screen to see new artwork and metadata (see Figure 12.14).

### Playing Your Content

Use the player controls in XBMC to manage your media playback (see Figure 12.15).

1. **Playback Controls**: Self-explanatory for anyone familiar with DVD players.
2. **Subtitle Management**: Manage subtitles.
3. **Video Settings**: Adjust aspect ratio, black bar cropping, and brightness/contrast.
4. **Audio Settings**: Customize audio delay, subtitles, and more.
5. **Bookmarks**: Set, go to, and delete bookmarks.

### Installing Add-Ons

XBMC/Raspbmc add-ons extend the functionality of your media player. You can find a variety of tools, including:

- Apple iTunes podcasts
- Break.com and CollegeHumor prank videos
- Weather and webcams
- News headlines
- Streaming video from online sources

##### Task: Installing Add-Ons

1. **Navigate to Add-Ons**:
   - Hover over `Pictures`, `Videos`, `TV Shows`, or `Music` on the home page.
   - Click `Add-ons` and then `Get More...`.

2. **Select and Install Add-Ons**:
   - Browse the list, double-click the desired add-on, and click `Install`.

3. **Use Add-Ons**:
   - Return to the Add-ons window and double-click the installed app to get started.
