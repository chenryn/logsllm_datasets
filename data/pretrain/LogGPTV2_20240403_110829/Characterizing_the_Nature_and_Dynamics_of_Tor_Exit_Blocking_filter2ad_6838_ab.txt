### 26th USENIX Security Symposium

#### Exit Family Analysis
The following table summarizes the number of exit nodes, the percentage of Tor traffic they handle, and the number and type of complaints received.

| Exit Family | # Exits | % Tor Traffic | Email Dates | # Complaints | Top Complaint |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| Torservers.net | 10-20 | 7.05% | 2010/06–2016/04 | 2,987,017 | DMCA Violation (99.74%) |
| apx | 3 | 1.94% | 2014/11–2016/05 | 293 | Automated Scan (38.49%) |
| TorLand1 | 1 | 0.75% | 2011/12–2016/10 | 307 | Malicious Traffic (16.99%) |
| jahjah | 1 | 0.17% | 2016/1–2017/1 | 75 | Unauthorized Login Attempts (34.15%) |
| Our exits | 10 | 3.14% | 2016/9–2017/2 | 650 | Network Attack (48.68%) |

**Note:** The jahjah exit was started in 2015, but the operator could only provide complaints from 2016 onwards.

### 4.2 Analysis
We analyzed the nature of abuse, the time of complaint, and the associated exit IP addresses. 99.7% of the complaints received by Torservers.net were related to Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) violations, with over 1 million of these complaints sent from a single IP address. These emails follow a template, allowing for parsing with regular expressions. Most non-DMCA emails also follow templates, but the structure varies across senders. To extract relevant abuse information from non-DMCA complaint emails, we first applied KMeans clustering to identify similar emails. We then manually crafted regular expressions for each cluster to assign high-confidence labels to emails. Some emails, such as one-off complaints, did not match these templates and were classified by looking for keywords related to types of abuse. This process was iteratively refined until manual labeling of random samples showed it to be highly accurate, with only a 2% misidentification rate.

### 4.3 Consequences of Undesired Traffic
Complaint emails often mention steps the sender will take to minimize abuse from Tor. 34.3% of the emails mentioned blocking measures: temporary blocking (19.8%), permanent blocking (0.2%), blacklisting (9.8%), or other types of blocking (4.6%). The rest of the emails notified the exit operators about the abuse. For temporary blocking, durations ranged from 10 minutes to a week. Some companies, like Webiron, maintain different blacklists based on the severity of the abuse. Most blacklists mentioned in the emails are either temporary or unspecified, with only 18 emails mentioning permanent blocking. A small fraction (less than 1%) of the emails asked exit operators to change the exit policy to disallow exiting to the corresponding website.

We did not find any complaint emails from known Tor discriminators, such as Cloudflare and Akamai. Among the websites we crawled to quantify discrimination against Tor, we found complaints from Expedia and Zillow. Expedia complained about unauthorized and excessive searches of their websites and asked exit operators to disallow exiting to their site. Zillow's complaint was less specific, stating that they experienced traffic in violation of their terms and conditions.

### 4.4 Exit Properties and Complaints
We investigated the effects of two exit properties—policy and bandwidth—on the number of corresponding abuse complaints. We counted the number of email complaints that explicitly mentioned the IP address of our exits. Higher-bandwidth exits received more complaints, which is statistically significant (Pearson’s product-moment correlation = 0.98, p-value = 0.0016). However, exit policy did not have a statistically significant correlation with the number of complaints. There were no significant differences between the types of complaints received by different exits.

### 4.5 Comparison with Average Tor Traffic
To understand how many Tor users would be affected if an exit is blocked due to abuse complaints, we estimated the average number of simultaneous Tor users per day using data from Tor Metrics. We then used historical Tor consensus to compute the amount of traffic through each exit per day. If an exit A handles e% of the total Tor bandwidth on day d and the number of simultaneous users of Tor on d is u, then approximately eu/100 of the users used A on day d. We excluded Torservers exits from this analysis because tracing them in historical consensuses is difficult due to frequent changes in IP addresses and exit fingerprints.

Compared to the average number of Tor users, the amount of abuse is insignificant (Table 4). However, one abuse email can correspond to multiple instances of abuse, such as a brute-force attack consisting of thousands of visits to a website.

### 5. IP Address Blacklisting
We analyzed how popular commercial IP blacklists treat Tor relays. IP blacklisting can be reactive, in response to malicious traffic, or proactive, based on a network’s pre-existing reputation or the online service’s policy. After discussing our data sources, we describe how we classify blacklist entries into proactive and reactive blacklisting. We then look at the amount of blacklisting of Tor and compare it to VPN IP address spaces and the IP address space of a large university in the USA. We analyze the impact of relay uptime, consensus weight, and exit policy on blacklisting behavior.

#### 5.1 Data Sources
For our study, we were given access to a system that gathers commercial IP threat intelligence, including blacklists, from large web companies. Facebook’s ThreatExchange platform is a major contributor to this system. Since July 25, 2015, the system has gathered roughly 2TB of data from 110 sources. We anonymized the names of some IP blacklists in our results.

Along with hourly Tor consensus data, we used additional methods to gather the set of Tor exit IP addresses seen by servers. While the Tor consensus provides the IP addresses used to reach exit relays, a significant fraction (6% to 10%) use a different IP address for connecting to servers. To capture these IP addresses, we associated each relay with its exit IP address provided by Tor DNSEL, which gathers the IP address used by a relay for exiting traffic based on active testing.

#### 5.2 Classifying Blacklist Entries
Given Tor’s reputation for transiting undesired traffic, some blacklists proactively include Tor relay IP addresses. To separate proactive blacklisting based on historical events from reactive blacklisting based on current events, we used several methods. In the simplest case, the blacklist provides the reason behind inclusion, either on an entry or on a list-wide basis. For lists that do not provide reasons, we inferred the reason for blacklisting by looking at the overall behavior of the list. If more than 30% of Tor relay addresses are enlisted on a blacklist within 24 hours of appearing in the consensus, we considered that blacklist proactive. The remaining lists were considered reactive.

Figures 2a and 2b compare the rate of blacklisting by a proactive and a reactive blacklist, showing the rate of blocking Tor exit IP addresses and non-exit Tor IP addresses. In a few cases, the time until blacklisting is negative, indicating the address was blacklisted before appearing in the consensus. Under our analysis, the blacklist Paid Aggregator is proactive since 76.6% of Tor IPs enlisted on it were added within 24 hours of first appearing in the consensus. We classify Contributed Blacklist 12 as reactive since only 0.06% of all Tor IP addresses were added within the first 24 hours of their appearance in the consensus or the DNSEL.

Using both methods of classifying lists, we found 84 lists that either include Tor exits proactively or reactively. Using the lists’ labels and names, we classified 4 blacklists as proactive. Additionally, 2 blacklists were classified as proactive based on the time taken to enlist Tor IP addresses.

Proactive blacklisting implies that Tor users share fate not only with other users of their exits but also with all Tor users, including those in the distant past. We found that 6 out of 84 (7%) large commercially deployed blacklists proactively block Tor IP addresses.

#### 5.3 Amount of Blacklisting
Figure 3 depicts the fraction of exit/non-exit relay IP addresses blacklisted by various lists during the observation timeframe. From 110 blacklists, 84 listed Tor IP addresses. For legibility, Figure 3 shows only the lists that included more than 1% of either Tor non-exit relays, Tor exit relays, or a VPN’s IP addresses.

We observed that a few blacklists list a large number of Tor IP addresses, including non-exit relay IP addresses. In particular, Paid Aggregator (the proactive list shown in Fig. 2a) listed 48% of Tor exit addresses and 35% of entry and middle relay IP addresses. Blacklisting non-exit relays is surprising since non-exit relays are not responsible for exiting traffic from the Tor network. Some relays have historically been both exit and non-exit relays at different points in time. In our analysis, we consider a relay an exit if it had the Exit flag at any point in its lifetime.
