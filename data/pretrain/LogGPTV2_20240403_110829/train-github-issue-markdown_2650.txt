* I have reviewed the FAQ for this repository and confirmed that this issue has not been previously addressed.

### Environment
* Dubbo version: 2.7.0-SNAPSHOT

### Steps to Reproduce the Issue
The README file in the 2.7.0 branch (https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/blob/2.7.0-release/README.md) still uses the package name `com.alibaba.dubbo`. This should be updated to `org.apache.dubbo`.
