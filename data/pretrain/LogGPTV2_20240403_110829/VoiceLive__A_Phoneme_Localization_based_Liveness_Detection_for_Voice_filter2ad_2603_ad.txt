Playback Attack. Figure 13 shows the ROC curves of
diﬀerent methods in detecting live users under playback at-
tacks. We observe that our system is highly eﬀective in
detecting live users and rejecting playback attacks. These
three methods provide more than 94% detection rate with
less than 1% FAR. In particular, the correlation and prob-
ability based methods have comparable performance. The
correlation method provides a detection rate of 95% with 1%
FAR. The combined method has the best performance and
results in over 99% detection rate with less than 1% false
accept rate.
Moreover, Figures 14 depicts the overall accuracy and
EER of diﬀerent methods under playback attacks. We ob-
serve that the combined method provides the best accuracy
and EER, which are 99.30% and 1.05% respectively. The
correlation method produces an accuracy of 97.95%, which
is slightly better than that of the probability method (i.e.,
97.54%). However, probability method results in a better
EER than that of the correlation method.
In particular,
probability method has an EER of 2.50% and correlation
method has an EER of 3.24%. The above results show that
VoiceLive is highly accurate in detecting live users under
playback attacks, and the combined method provides the
best results since it takes advantages of both the correction
and the probability based methods.
We next take a closer look at how our system performs
under static and mobile playback attacks.
In our experi-
ments, we observe the static playback attacks produce simi-
lar TDoA values for diﬀerent types of phoneme sounds. Al-
though playback attacks under mobile scenarios could re-
sult in TDoA changes, the resulted changes in TDoA can-
not match with the ones in the user proﬁle. It is because
the attacker couldn’t mimic the sound position transition
the same as that of the human vocal system. As shown in
Figure 15, our system is highly eﬀective in live user detec-
tion under both static and mobile playback attacks. The
combined method achieves 99.2% accuracy under static sce-
narios and 99.65% accuracy under mobile cases.
Replace Attack. We next evaluate the eﬀectiveness of
our system in defending against the replace attacks. Fig-
ure 16 illustrates the accuracy of diﬀerent methods with re-
place attacks conducted under diﬀerent social distances. In
particular, the testing positions of replace attacks fall into
intimate (1.2m). We observe that
our system can eﬀectively detect the live users and reject the
replace attacks under each category of social distances. For
example, the combined method provides 99.47% detection
accuracy under intimate relationship, 99.82% under personal
relationship, and 100% under social relationship and public
space. And all the methods provide over 98.95% detection
accuracy across diﬀerent categories.
Figure 17 shows the details on the accuracy and EER
of the combined method under each social distance. We
ﬁnd that both the accuracy and EER are improved with an
increased social distance. In particular, the EER decreases
from 0.43% to 0% and the accuracy is improved from 99.47%
to 100% when the distance is increased from 30cm to 150cm.
When the attacker is further away, our system can detect all
the live user cases and reject all the replace attacks. This
is because when increasing the distance between the phone
and user’s mouth, the TDoA dynamic diminishes rapidly.
We also investigate the replace attacks launched from 25cm
behind the user and 40cm from the side of user. The EER of
the combined method under these two cases are 0.33% and
0%, respectively. Such results are comparable to the EER
in Figure 17. This shows our system is capable of detecting
replace attack conducted from diﬀerent directions.
4.3
Impact of Passphrase Length
Generally, a passphrase with longer length provides stronger
security. It also produces more phoneme sounds that gen-
erate more changes in the TDoA measurements. We thus
study the performance of our system with diﬀerent lengths
of passphrases.
In particular, we sort all the passphrases
into three categories including short passphrases with 2 to 4
words, appropriate passphrasses with 5 to 7 words, and long
passphrases with 8 to 10 words. Note that researchers and
professionals in voice authentication suggest that a passphrase
should contain at least 5 words so as to provide suﬃcient se-
curity level [7].

for diﬀerent lengths of passphrases, respectively. We observe
that both the accuracy and EER are improved for all the
methods when we increase the length of the passphrase. In
particular, the accuracy is improved from 98.78% to 100%
and the EER is reduced from 1.78% to 0% for combined
method, when we increase the length from 2-4 words to
more than 7 words. In addition, with an appropriate length
of passphrase (i.e., 5 to 7 words), the combined method re-
sults in 99.65% accuracy and 1% EER. The results con-
ﬁrm our observation that a longer passphrase leads to more
TDoA changes of phoneme sounds, which improves the per-
formance of the live user detection.
4.4 Effect of Sampling Frequency
As not all the smartphones are installed with the latest
OS, older version of OSs can only support the standard sam-
pling frequency at 48kHz or 96kHz. We thus study how ro-
bust our system is to lower sampling frequencies. Figure 20
and Figure 21 show the accuracy and EER under diﬀer-
ent sampling frequencies respectively. We observe that our
system works eﬀectively under all of these three sampling
frequencies. Although with higher sampling rates, it does
have better accuracy and EER due to higher ranging reso-
lution. In particular, for combined method the accuracy is
over 95% under 48kHz, and over 97% under 96kHz, whereas
the EER is at around 3% for both 48kHz and 96kHz. These
results show that our liveness detection system could work
with both the state-of-the-art smartphones as well as low-
end smartphones.
4.5
Impact of Different Phones
As one user may use one phone to enroll in the system but
uses another one to perform online authentication, we study
how our system behaves under diﬀerent phones. Speciﬁcally,
we experiment with users to use either Note5, Note3, or S5 to
enroll in the system and then utilize the other two for online
authentication. These three types of phones diﬀer in size and
audio hardware as described in the experimental setup. Fig-
ure 22 shows the accuracy of diﬀerent methods when using
one phone as enrollment and the others as online authenti-
cation. We observe that our system still provides accurate
liveness detection. In particular, the combined method re-
sults in accuracy of 97.82%, 96.67%, 96% when using Note5,
Note3, and S5 as the phone for enrollment while the other
two for authentication, respectively. Moreover, we observe
that these three methods have comparable performance no
matter which phone is used for enrollment or authentica-
tion. Although the accuracy is slightly higher when using
the same phone (i.e., about 99%), our system still produces
very accurate detection results with diﬀerent phones. Such
observations show that our system is robust and compatible
to diﬀerent phone models.
4.6 Robustness to Phone Displacement
When performing online authentication, our system re-
quires the user to place the phone at a similar position to
that when the user enrolled in the system. We thus study
our system’s performance if there exists displacement of the
phone between the position for enrollment and online au-
thentication. Speciﬁcally, we experiment with diﬀerent de-
grees of phone displacements when performing authentica-
tion, i.e., 1cm, 2cm, and 3cm away from the position that
user enrolled in the system. Such displacements occur on
each axis: Left (X axis), Down (Z axis), and Forward (Y
axis). Figure 23 and Figure 24 show the accuracy and EER
under diﬀerent degrees of phone displacements, respectively.
We observe that although a higher degree of displacement
results in lower accuracy and higher EER, our system over-
all still provides accurate detection results: the accuracy
is more than 98% for all the displacements and EER is also
maintained at a very low rate, ranging from 1% to 3%, when
using combined method. Moreover, we ﬁnd that our system
is more sensitive to the displacements on Y axis (i.e., For-
ward) and less sensitive to X axis (i.e., Left). This is be-
cause by moving the phone forward, the maximum achiev-
able TDoA range will be reduced quickly with the increased
distance, as shown in Section 5. The results may also indi-
cate VoiceLive is not sensitive to the small movements of the
phone (e.g., hand movements). In addition, the time dura-
tion of speaking a passphrase is usually about 2-3 seconds.
The movements of the phone within such a short duration
are usually small and may have limited eﬀect.

4.7 Effect of Phone’s Placement
Diﬀerent users might have diﬀerent ways to place the
phone close to their mouths during the authentication pro-
cess. We thus compare the performance of our system un-
der two types of placements, vertical and horizontal, as de-
scribed in experimental setup. Figure 25 illustrates the ac-
curacy comparison of these two placements. We observe
that our system achieves very high accuracy for both place-
ments, with the accuracy slightly higher when the phone is
placed vertically. Speciﬁcally, the accuracy under horizontal
placement is 97.41%, 97.26%, and 99.13% for correlation,
probability, and combined method respectively. Figure 26
shows the EER under two displacements. We have simi-
lar observation to that of the accuracy. In particular, EER
is 3.3%, 2.69%, and 1.33% for correlation, probability, and
combined method respectively. Results show that our sys-
tem works very well for diﬀerent phone placements including
