### 4.2 Performance Evaluation

#### Playback Attack
Figure 13 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for different methods in detecting live users under playback attacks. Our system is highly effective, with all three methods achieving a detection rate of over 94% and a False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of less than 1%. Specifically, the correlation method achieves a 95% detection rate with a 1% FAR, while the combined method provides the best performance, resulting in a detection rate of over 99% with a FAR of less than 1%.

Figure 14 depicts the overall accuracy and Equal Error Rate (EER) of different methods under playback attacks. The combined method offers the highest accuracy and the lowest EER, at 99.30% and 1.05%, respectively. The correlation method has an accuracy of 97.95%, which is slightly better than the probability method's 97.54%. However, the probability method has a lower EER (2.50%) compared to the correlation method (3.24%). These results demonstrate that VoiceLive is highly accurate in detecting live users under playback attacks, with the combined method providing the best results by leveraging both correlation and probability-based approaches.

We also examined the system's performance under static and mobile playback attacks. In static scenarios, playback attacks produce similar Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) values for different phoneme sounds. While mobile scenarios can cause TDoA changes, these changes do not match those in the user profile because the attacker cannot mimic the sound position transitions of the human vocal system. As shown in Figure 15, our system is highly effective in detecting live users under both static and mobile playback attacks, with the combined method achieving 99.2% accuracy in static scenarios and 99.65% accuracy in mobile cases.

#### Replace Attack
Next, we evaluate the effectiveness of our system in defending against replace attacks. Figure 16 illustrates the accuracy of different methods under replace attacks conducted at various social distances: intimate (1.2m), personal (1.2-2.4m), and social (beyond 2.4m). Our system effectively detects live users and rejects replace attacks across all categories. For example, the combined method provides 99.47% detection accuracy in intimate relationships, 99.82% in personal relationships, and 100% in social relationships and public spaces. All methods achieve over 98.95% detection accuracy across different categories.

Figure 17 shows the accuracy and EER of the combined method under each social distance. Both accuracy and EER improve as the social distance increases. Specifically, the EER decreases from 0.43% to 0% and the accuracy improves from 99.47% to 100% when the distance increases from 30cm to 150cm. At greater distances, our system can detect all live user cases and reject all replace attacks due to the rapid diminishment of TDoA dynamics. We also tested replace attacks from 25cm behind the user and 40cm to the side, with EERs of 0.33% and 0%, respectively, confirming the system's robustness against attacks from different directions.

#### Impact of Passphrase Length
Generally, longer passphrases provide stronger security and generate more TDoA changes. We categorized passphrases into three groups: short (2-4 words), appropriate (5-7 words), and long (8-10 words). Research suggests that a passphrase should contain at least 5 words for sufficient security [7].

Figures 18 and 19 illustrate the accuracy and EER for different passphrase lengths. Both accuracy and EER improve as the passphrase length increases. For the combined method, the accuracy improves from 98.78% to 100% and the EER decreases from 1.78% to 0% when the passphrase length increases from 2-4 words to more than 7 words. With an appropriate passphrase length (5-7 words), the combined method achieves 99.65% accuracy and 1% EER, confirming that longer passphrases enhance live user detection performance.

#### Effect of Sampling Frequency
Not all smartphones support the latest OS, and some older versions only support sampling frequencies of 48kHz or 96kHz. We studied the robustness of our system to these lower sampling frequencies. Figures 20 and 21 show the accuracy and EER under different sampling frequencies. Our system works effectively at all three frequencies, although higher sampling rates provide better accuracy and EER due to higher ranging resolution. For the combined method, the accuracy is over 95% at 48kHz and over 97% at 96kHz, with EERs around 3% for both. This indicates that our liveness detection system is compatible with both state-of-the-art and low-end smartphones.

#### Impact of Different Phones
Users may enroll using one phone and authenticate with another. We tested our system with Note5, Note3, and S5, which differ in size and audio hardware. Figure 22 shows the accuracy when using one phone for enrollment and the others for authentication. Our system still provides accurate liveness detection. The combined method achieves accuracies of 97.82%, 96.67%, and 96% when using Note5, Note3, and S5 for enrollment, respectively. Although the accuracy is slightly higher when using the same phone (about 99%), our system remains highly accurate with different phones, demonstrating robustness and compatibility across various models.

#### Robustness to Phone Displacement
Our system requires the user to place the phone in a similar position during enrollment and online authentication. We studied the system's performance under different degrees of phone displacement (1cm, 2cm, and 3cm) on the X (Left), Y (Forward), and Z (Down) axes. Figures 23 and 24 show the accuracy and EER under different displacements. While higher displacements result in lower accuracy and higher EER, the system still provides accurate detection: the accuracy is over 98% for all displacements, and the EER ranges from 1% to 3% for the combined method. The system is more sensitive to displacements on the Y axis and less sensitive to the X axis. This is because moving the phone forward reduces the maximum achievable TDoA range quickly. The results indicate that VoiceLive is not significantly affected by small phone movements, such as hand movements, within the short duration of speaking a passphrase (2-3 seconds).

#### Effect of Phone's Placement
Different users may place the phone differently during authentication. We compared the system's performance under vertical and horizontal placements. Figure 25 shows the accuracy for both placements. The system achieves high accuracy in both configurations, with slightly higher accuracy in vertical placement. Specifically, the accuracy under horizontal placement is 97.41%, 97.26%, and 99.13% for the correlation, probability, and combined methods, respectively. Figure 26 shows the EER, with similar observations: EERs are 3.3%, 2.69%, and 1.33% for the correlation, probability, and combined methods, respectively. These results indicate that our system works well for different phone placements, including both vertical and horizontal orientations.
