The Final Attack
Due to the nature of the attack, it works best as a tool which rebuilds regular PE files.
Load target PE file
Apply original relocations for base of 0x00010000
Turn ASLR off by flipping a bit in the PE Header
Set desiredBase to 0xFFFF0000
Loop over data to obfuscate in uint32_t-sized chunks, decrementing each by
0x00010000 - 0xFFFF0000 (expected value of delta)
Discard original relocations table
Generate new relocations table containg the location of each decrement done inside
of the loop (using IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW)
