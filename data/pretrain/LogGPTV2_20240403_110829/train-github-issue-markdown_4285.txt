### Vue.js version
1.0.26
### Reproduction Link
https://jsfiddle.net/gregmi/yLqnv2ex/
### Steps to reproduce
  1. run and check the output, it says: "params.myAttr: undefined"
  2. comment out the line 13 (props)
  3. run again and check the output, it says: "params.myAttr: content"
### What is Expected?
It should say: "myAttr: content"
### What is actually happening?
When there is a tag **attribute** that is also a vue **property** and vue
**directive** parameter at the same time, it is not reachable from within a
vue directive ( _this.params.myAttr_ ), but one can get it from vm (
_this.vm.myAttr_ ).
It seem like a race condition of sorts (in time when vm properties are
created) between vue component and vue directive.
