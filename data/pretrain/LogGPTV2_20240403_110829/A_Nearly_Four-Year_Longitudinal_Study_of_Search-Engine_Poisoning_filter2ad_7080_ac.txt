### 5.1 Overview

This section focuses on the analysis of search results for pharmaceutical goods, specifically examining the different categories of results returned in response to queries containing drug names. For consistency, we use and extend the definitions provided in our earlier work [15].

**Categories of Search Results:**

1. **Licensed Pharmacies:**
   - These are pharmacies verified by LegitScript [19].

2. **Health Resources:**
   - Websites that provide information about drugs, typically benign. We use data from the Open Directory Project [8] to identify these sites.

3. **Unlicensed Pharmacies:**
   - Characterized as such by LegitScript and appearing directly in organic search results.

4. **Content Injection (Blog and Forum Spam):**
   - Websites with drug-related spam posts, often identified through URL parameters containing terms like "blog" or "forum."

5. **Search-Redirections:**
   - Domains that redirect users to online pharmacies, generally unrelated to prescription drugs. Defined in Section 3.

6. **Content Injection (Compromised):**
   - Websites other than blogs and forums where attackers have injected drug-related content but do not exhibit signs of search-redirection. We apply heuristics based on URLs with embedded storefronts to identify these sites.

7. **Unclassified:**
   - Sites that do not fit into any of the above categories. These may include benign websites, undetected malicious sites, or marginally relevant results.

### 5.2 Search Result Dynamics

**Table 3: Search-Result Composition (November 2010 â€“ September 2013)**

| Result Category              | % of Results | Range (%) | # of Results |
|------------------------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Active Search-Redirection    | 38.8         | [8.7, 61.7]| 621,623      |
| Unclassified                 | 18.8         | [6.3, 35.4]| 300,427      |
| Unlicensed Pharmacies        | 16.9         | [12.1, 30.1]| 271,045      |
| Health Resources             | 7.7          | [4.2, 14.5]| 123,883      |
| Blog & Forum Spam            | 7.1          | [3.0, 16.4]| 113,250      |
| Content Injection (Compromised)| 4.7       | [1.9, 10.0]| 74,556       |
| Future Search-Redirection    | 4.1          | [0.0, 6.7] | 65,548       |
| Inactive Search-Redirection  | 1.8          | [0.0, 10.6]| 28,976       |
| Licensed Pharmacies          | 0.2          | [0.0, 0.9] | 2,779        |
| **Total**                    | **1,602,087**|           |              |

**Figure 2: Percentage of Search Results per Category (7-Day Sliding Window)**

- **Active Redirections:** Dominated the search results, peaking at nearly 60%.
- **Unclassified Results:** Decreased over time.
- **Unlicensed Pharmacies:** Remained stable around 15-20%.
- **Licensed Pharmacies:** Hovered near zero.
- **Spam Content:** Marginal decrease until late 2012.

**Search-Engine Interventions:**
- **G1 (February 23, 2011):** Google's improved ranking algorithm caused a significant drop in redirecting results (2.3%, p = 0.003) and spam websites (2.7%, p < 0.001). However, this improvement was transient.
- **G2 (October 2011) and G3 (March 2012):** Google updated its service to remove HTTP Referrer information, but redirects continued to increase (9.9%, p < 0.001).

**Browser Evolution:**
- **B1 (July 17, 2012):** Firefox 14 introduced HTTPS search by default.
- **B2 (September 19, 2012):** Safari followed suit.
- **B3 (January 13, 2013):** Google Chrome switched to HTTPS search, leading to a stagnation and eventual decrease in active redirections.

**Top-10 Search Results:**
- **Figure 3:** Examines the top-10 results, showing that actively redirecting results occur about 10% less frequently, while direct links to unlicensed pharmacies are 10% more frequent.

**Undetected Infections:**
- **Figure 4:** Proportion of unclassified results detected as malicious by VirusTotal. Overall, 19.5% of unclassified results appear as malicious, indicating that miscreants may be using other forms of manipulation, such as JavaScript-based compromises.

### 5.3 User Intentions

**Figure 5: Proportion of Results for Illicit, Gray, and Benign Queries Over Time**

- **Key Finding:** Regardless of the type of query, active redirects dominate results. Unlicensed pharmacies also appear significantly in both illicit and gray queries, suggesting that search result poisoning is not solely driven by user intent.

### 6. Cleanup-Campaign Evolution

**Overall Impact:**
- **Decrease in Redirections:** Despite a decrease in 2013, claiming success in solving the search-redirection problem would be premature. Source infections can be cleaned by webmasters removing the infection or search engines demoting the website due to foul play.

This structured and detailed approach provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the search result dynamics and the impact of various interventions.
