User: I am undergoing Udacity's Web Development course which uses Google AppEngine and Python. 
I would like to set up specific user roles, and their alloted permissions. For example, I may have two users roles, Employer and SkilledPerson, and assign their permissions as follows:
Only Employers may create Job entities.
Only SkilledPerson may create Resume and JobApplication entities.
How do I do this?
How do I define these user roles?
How do I assign a group of permissions to specific roles?
How do I allow users to sign up as a particular role (Employer or SkilledPerson)?
Assistant: I'd create a user_profile table which stores their Google user id, and two Boolean fields for is_employer and is_skilled_person, because there's always potential for someone to be both of these roles on your site. (Maybe I'm an employer posting a job but also looking for a job as well)
If you perceive having multiple roles and a user can only be one role, I'd make it a string field holding the role name like "employer", "admin", "job seeker" and so on.
