Question: You are conducting a security test on a web application to identify privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Your objective is to ensure that users cannot access resources or functionalities beyond their given permissions. Which of the following steps would be most effective in achieving your objective?
"A": "Identify and target injection points related to privilege manipulation, employing tools such as Zed Attack Proxy to fuzz and bypass security measures.",
"B": "Implement role-based authentication checks at the application's frontend only, assuming the backend is secure.",
"C": "Assume all users will follow the intended application flow and, therefore, only test the application's main functionality without considering privilege manipulation.",
"D": "Focus solely on external threats and disregard the possibility of internal users attempting to escalate their privileges."
Answer: A
