Framework

Abstract
Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM) systems are a widely
deployed facility to detect, analyze, and characterize dan(cid:173)
gerous Internet
threats such as worms and distributed
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Nonetheless, an ITM
system can also become the target ofattack. In this paper,
we address localization attacks against ITM systems in
which an attacker impairs the effectiveness ofITM systems
by identifying the locations of ITM monitors. We propose
an information-theoretic framework for the modeling of
localization attacks as communication channels. Based on
the information-theoretic model, we generalize all existing
attacks as Htemporal attacks ", derive closed formulae
of their performance, and propose an effective detection
approach. The information-theoretic model also inspires
a new attack called a spatial attack and motivates the
corresponding detection approach. We show simulation
results that support our theoretic findings.

have caused massive damage, ranging from tens of thou(cid:173)
sands to billions of dollars per incident [1], [3].
The widely-spreading nature of such attacks calls for
Internet-wide collaborative monitoring and defense sys(cid:173)
tems which should be able to characterize,
track, and
mitigate security threats in a timely fashion [4]. The design
of Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM) systems has been one
such major effort. In general, an ITM system consists of
one centralized data center and a number of monitors,
which are distributed across the Internet. Each monitor
monitors traffic addressed to a range of IP addresses and
periodically sends the traffic logs to the data center. The
data center then analyzes the collected traffic logs and
publishes reports (e.g., statistics of monitored traffic) to
ITM system users. Although the IP address space directly
monitored by an ITM system is much smaller in scale
than the Internet global address space [4], [5], [6],
the
collected logs, as a random sample of the Internet traffic,
can still provide critical insights for the public to measure,
characterize, and track/detect Internet security threats. The
idea of ITM systems dates back to DShield and CAIDA
network telescope [7], [8], which have been successfully
used to analyze the activities of worms and DDoS attacks
[4], [9]. The success of such systems led to the deployment
of many similar ITM systems around the world [4], [5],
[6], [10], [11].
The success of ITM systems heavily relies on the
confidentiality of the IP addresses covered by the monitors
(i.e.,
the monitor locations). The reason is that if an
attacker discovers the monitor locations, it can easily avoid
detection (by ITM systems) by bypassing the monitored
IP addresses and directing the attack to the much larger
space of unmonitored IP addresses. Furthermore, such an
attacker may even mislead the reports published by an ITM
system by manipulating traffic to the identified monitors,
generating highly skewed samples. Since ITM reports are
trusted by the public as a random (unbiased) sample of
Internet traffic, the confidentiality of monitor locations is
vital for the usability of ITM systems.
Recently, researchers have discovered several attacking

mechanisms designed to compromise the monitor locations
of an ITM system [12], [13], [14]. An example is the
probing-traffic-based localization attacks [12],
in
which an attacker launches a short high-rate port-scan
probing traffic to a targeted network and then queries the
data center to determine whether the short spike of high(cid:173)
rate traffic appears in the queried time-series data. If so,
then the attacker can infer that a monitor exists in the
targeted network. Although this attack can compromise
the location of ITM monitors, it also reveals itself to an
ITM system that monitors such a spike in traffic volume.
To solve this problem, we discovered a steganographic
in which an attacker launches
localization attack [14],
a low-rate noise-like port-scan probing traffic that
is
marginally modulated by a secret Pseudo-Noise (PN)-code.
While the modulated probing traffic does not show any
obvious regularity at
the attacker can
develop the accurate recognition technique based on the
same synchronized PN-code to accurately determine the
PN-code modulated traffic in the retrieved traffic log from
the data center; thereby, the existence of monitors in the
targeted network is obtained.
the data center,
In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic
framework to model existing localization attacks. Recall
that in localization attacks, an attacker sends probing traffic
with a specific pattern to the target networks and then
queries the ITM data center for traffic logs. We model
this scan-query process as a side communication channel
and derive closed fonnulae of its channel capacity. To
evaluate the effectiveness of a localization attack, we use
the minimum time length required by an attacker achiev(cid:173)
ing a pre-defined detection rate as the metric. Based on
the information-theoretic model, we propose an effective
approach of detecting existing localization attacks, derive
a new localization attack, and propose a new approach
of detecting this new attack. Our numerical data and
simulation results validate our theoretical results well. The
major contributions of this paper can be summarized as
follows.
1. We propose an infonnation-theoretic framework to
model localization attacks against ITM systems, and use
the framework to analyze the perfonnance of existing
attacking schemes. In particular, we generalize existing
localization attacks [12], [13], [14] as temporal attacks,
where the side channel
is a Single-Input Single-Output
(SISO) one. We show that the existing centralized detection
based upon the aggregated traffic information from all
monitors of an ITM system becomes ineffective against
the temporal attack proposed in [14]. In order to defend
against such an attack, we investigate a distributed detec(cid:173)
tion scheme, which detects traffic-rate change at individual
monitors. This scheme will force the attacker (who is
aware of the distributed detection scheme) to lower the
probing traffic rate. Hence,
the capacity of the SISO
2
channel will be reduced significantly and the minimum
time length required by the localization attack will be
increased to a prohibitively high level.
2. Based on the infonnation-theoretic framework, we
propose a novel localization attack, which we call a spatial
attack, that outperforms all existing attacks. With the spa(cid:173)
tial attack, an attacker launches a number of coordinated
attacks on different monitors. This attack can be modeled
as a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) side channel
in
the information-theoretic model. We find that the spatial
attack renders the distributed detection ineffective, because
the minimum time length required by the localization
attack can be significantly reduced. To defend against
such an attack, we propose a hybrid detection scheme
which detects traffic correlation across multiple monitors.
The scheme will force the attacker (who is aware of the
hybrid detection scheme) to lower the probing traffic rate.
Hence, the capacity of the MISO channel will be reduced
significantly and the minimum time length required by the
localization attack will be increased to a prohibitively high
level.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section II, we briefly review ITM systems and the
threat model. In Section III, we present the information(cid:173)
theoretic framework to model the localization attack. In
Section IV, we present the theory of detecting temporal
attacks proposed in [14]. In Section V, we present the
theory of detecting spatial attacks. We report our numerical
data and simulation results in Section VI. We review the
related work in Section VII, followed by final remarks in
Section VIII.
II. ITM Systems and Threat Model
In this section, we first briefly review the background
of ITM systems and then introduce the threat model used
in this paper.
A. ITM Systems
In an ITM system, monitors are geographically dis(cid:173)
tributed over the Internet to capture the anomalous traffic
(e.g., port-scans) addressed to a set of monitored IP ad(cid:173)
dresses. The monitors can be deployed at hosts, routers, or
firewalls etc [4]. The monitors periodically forward traffic
logs to a data center, which analyzes the logs and publishes
reports periodically. For each time slot, the reports provide
three basic statistics for each port of concern: the number
of scans (the total number of entries among the logs); the
number of scan sources (the number of distinct source IP
addresses in the logs); and the number of scan targets (the
total number of distinct destination IP addresses in the
logs). To support Internet security research and practice,

based user interfaces [4], [5], [6].
We assume that
there are total q networks (denoted
rn (m Â« q) of
as M 1 , M 2 , .. . , M q ) on the Internet,
which are monitored by the ITM system. Monitors on
these m networks periodically send their locally stored
logs to the data center. We use the G(.) to formulate the
relationship between the network and the ITM system.

network M j has monitors associated with the ITM system;
otherwise, network M j does not have monitors associated
with the ITM system, and G(Mj ) = O.

B. Threat Model
The attacker has
the ultimate goal of obtaining
G(Mj )(j E [1, q]) without being detected by the ITM
system. The defender's goal is to detect such an attack.
After the attack has been detected, various mitigation
techniques can be applied by defenders to reduce or
eliminate its effects [15], [16]. Before we proceed, we
need to clarify the capabilities of both the attacker and
defender. We assume that
the attacker is active and is
able to initiate port-scan probing traffic using a variety
of means, such as botnets [1 7]. The attacker is also able
to adjust the frequency and intensity of the attack traffic
in order to evade detection. We assume that the defender
has the capability to detect traffic anomalies by analyzing
traffic reports from both the data center and individual
monitors in the ITM system.
As we mentioned earlier, researchers have discovered
several localization attacks designed to locate monitors of
ITM systems [12], [13], [14]. Fig. 1 describes the basic
procedures of the generalized localization attack, which
consists of the following two stages: (1) Generation of
Attack Traffic:
the
attacker first selects the signal of a pattern, or mark (e.g.,
a high-rate spike, a sequence of binary code). Then, the
attacker modulates and generates the probing traffic by
embedding the selected signal
into the probing traffic.
In this stage, as shown in Fig.l(a),
Lastly, the attacker launches the probing traffic towards a
target network (e.g., network A in Fig. l(aÂ». For example,
if the sequence of code is (1, 0),
the attacker will first
launch the probing traffic with a given rate for a time
duration and then stop the probing traffic for a time
duration. In this way, the attacker embeds the attack traffic
with a special pattern (1, 0). (2) Confirmation ofAttack: In
this stage, as shown in Fig.l (b), the attacker first queries
the data center for the traffic report data. Such report
data reflects both probing traffic and background traffic.
