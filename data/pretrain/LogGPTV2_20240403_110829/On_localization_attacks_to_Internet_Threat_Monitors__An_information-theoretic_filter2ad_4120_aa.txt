**Abstract:**

Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM) systems are widely deployed to detect, analyze, and characterize dangerous threats such as worms and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. However, ITM systems themselves can become targets of attacks. This paper addresses localization attacks, where an attacker impairs the effectiveness of ITM systems by identifying the locations of ITM monitors. We propose an information-theoretic framework to model these localization attacks as communication channels. Based on this model, we generalize existing attacks as "temporal attacks," derive closed-form expressions for their performance, and propose an effective detection approach. The information-theoretic model also inspires a new type of attack called a "spatial attack" and motivates a corresponding detection method. Simulation results support our theoretical findings.

**1. Introduction**

The widespread use of the Internet has brought convenience to daily life and facilitated global network-based business. However, its open nature also attracts various security threats, such as worms and DDoS attacks, which have caused significant financial damage, ranging from tens of thousands to billions of dollars per incident [1], [3].

To address the pervasive nature of these threats, there is a need for collaborative, Internet-wide monitoring and defense systems capable of characterizing, tracking, and mitigating security threats in real-time [4]. One major effort in this direction is the design of Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM) systems. These systems typically consist of a centralized data center and multiple distributed monitors across the Internet. Each monitor collects traffic data for a range of IP addresses and periodically sends logs to the data center. The data center then analyzes the collected logs and publishes reports, such as statistics on monitored traffic, to ITM system users. Although the IP address space directly monitored by an ITM system is smaller than the global Internet address space [4], [5], [6], the collected logs provide valuable insights into Internet security threats. The concept of ITM systems dates back to DShield and CAIDA's network telescope [7], [8], which have been used successfully to analyze worm and DDoS activities [4], [9]. The success of these systems has led to the deployment of many similar ITM systems worldwide [4], [5], [6], [10], [11].

The effectiveness of ITM systems relies heavily on the confidentiality of the IP addresses covered by the monitors. If an attacker discovers the monitor locations, they can avoid detection by bypassing the monitored IP addresses and targeting unmonitored IP addresses. Additionally, the attacker may manipulate traffic to the identified monitors, generating skewed samples that mislead the public, who trust ITM reports as unbiased samples of Internet traffic. Therefore, the confidentiality of monitor locations is crucial for the usability of ITM systems.

Recently, researchers have discovered several mechanisms designed to compromise the monitor locations of ITM systems [12], [13], [14]. For example, probing-traffic-based localization attacks [12] involve launching high-rate port-scan traffic to a targeted network and querying the data center to determine if the spike appears in the time-series data. While this attack can reveal monitor locations, it also exposes the attacker to detection by the ITM system. To address this, a steganographic localization attack [14] was developed, where the attacker uses low-rate, noise-like port-scan traffic modulated by a secret Pseudo-Noise (PN) code. The modulated traffic does not show obvious regularity, but the attacker can accurately recognize the PN-code-modulated traffic in the retrieved logs, thereby inferring the presence of monitors.

In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic framework to model and analyze localization attacks. We model the scan-query process as a side communication channel and derive closed-form expressions for its channel capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of a localization attack using the minimum time required to achieve a predefined detection rate. Based on this model, we propose an effective detection approach for existing attacks, introduce a new spatial attack, and propose a new detection method. Our numerical data and simulation results validate our theoretical findings. The main contributions of this paper are:

1. **Information-Theoretic Framework:** We propose an information-theoretic framework to model localization attacks against ITM systems. We generalize existing localization attacks [12], [13], [14] as temporal attacks, where the side channel is a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) channel. We show that centralized detection based on aggregated traffic information from all monitors becomes ineffective against the temporal attack proposed in [14]. To defend against such attacks, we investigate a distributed detection scheme that detects traffic-rate changes at individual monitors. This forces the attacker to lower the probing traffic rate, significantly reducing the SISO channel capacity and increasing the minimum time required for the localization attack.

2. **Spatial Attack and Detection:** Based on the information-theoretic framework, we propose a novel spatial attack that outperforms existing attacks. In a spatial attack, the attacker launches coordinated attacks on different monitors, modeled as a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) side channel. We find that the spatial attack renders distributed detection ineffective, as it significantly reduces the minimum time required for the localization attack. To counter this, we propose a hybrid detection scheme that detects traffic correlation across multiple monitors. This forces the attacker to lower the probing traffic rate, reducing the MISO channel capacity and increasing the minimum time required for the localization attack to a prohibitively high level.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows:
- Section II provides a brief overview of ITM systems and the threat model.
- Section III presents the information-theoretic framework for modeling localization attacks.
- Section IV discusses the theory of detecting temporal attacks.
- Section V covers the theory of detecting spatial attacks.
- Section VI reports our numerical data and simulation results.
- Section VII reviews related work.
- Section VIII concludes the paper with final remarks.

**II. ITM Systems and Threat Model**

**A. ITM Systems**

In an ITM system, monitors are geographically distributed over the Internet to capture anomalous traffic, such as port-scans, addressed to a set of monitored IP addresses. These monitors can be deployed at hosts, routers, or firewalls [4]. They periodically forward traffic logs to a data center, which analyzes the logs and publishes reports. For each time slot, the reports provide three basic statistics for each port of concern: the number of scans, the number of scan sources, and the number of scan targets. To support Internet security research and practice, such report data are commonly accessible through query-based user interfaces [4], [5], [6].

We assume there are \( q \) networks on the Internet, denoted as \( M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_q \), with \( m \) (where \( m \ll q \)) of these networks monitored by the ITM system. Monitors on these \( m \) networks periodically send their locally stored logs to the data center. We use the function \( G(\cdot) \) to represent the relationship between a network and the ITM system. Given a network \( M_j \), if \( G(M_j) = 1 \), then network \( M_j \) has monitors associated with the ITM system; otherwise, \( G(M_j) = 0 \).

**B. Threat Model**

The attacker's goal is to obtain \( G(M_j) \) for all \( j \in [1, q] \) without being detected by the ITM system. The defender's goal is to detect such an attack. Once detected, various mitigation techniques can be applied to reduce or eliminate the attack's effects [15], [16]. We assume the attacker is active and can initiate port-scan probing traffic using various means, such as botnets [17]. The attacker can also adjust the frequency and intensity of the attack traffic to evade detection. We assume the defender has the capability to detect traffic anomalies by analyzing traffic reports from both the data center and individual monitors in the ITM system.

Researchers have discovered several localization attacks designed to locate monitors of ITM systems [12], [13], [14]. Figure 1 describes the basic procedures of a generalized localization attack, which consists of two stages:

1. **Generation of Attack Traffic:**
   - The attacker selects a signal pattern or mark (e.g., a high-rate spike, a sequence of binary code).
   - The attacker modulates and generates the probing traffic by embedding the selected signal into the traffic.
   - The attacker launches the probing traffic towards a target network (e.g., network A in Fig. 1(a)). For example, if the signal is (1, 0), the attacker will first launch the probing traffic for a given duration and then stop it for another duration, embedding the pattern (1, 0) into the traffic.

2. **Confirmation of Attack:**
   - The attacker queries the data center for the traffic report data, which includes both probing and background traffic.
   - The attacker then recognizes the embedded attack mark in the traffic report, confirming the presence of monitors in the target network (Fig. 1(b)).
