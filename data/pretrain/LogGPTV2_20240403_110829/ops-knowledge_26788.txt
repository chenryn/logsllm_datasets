User: I started to use celery flower for tasks monitoring and it is working like a charm. I have one concern though, how can i "reload" info about monitored tasks after flower restart ?
I use redis as a broker, and i need to have option to check on tasks even in case of unexpected restart of service (or server).
Thanks in advance
Assistant: I found i out. 
It is the matter of setting the persistant flag in command running celery flower.
