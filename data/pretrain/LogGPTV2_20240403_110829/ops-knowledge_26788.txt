I recently started using Celery Flower for task monitoring, and it has been working exceptionally well. However, I have one concern: how can I refresh the information about monitored tasks after a Flower restart?

I am using Redis as the broker, and I need to ensure that I can still check on the tasks even in the event of an unexpected service (or server) restart.

Thank you in advance.

**Update:**

I have found a solution. It involves setting the `--persistent` flag when running the Celery Flower command. This ensures that the task information is retained across restarts.
