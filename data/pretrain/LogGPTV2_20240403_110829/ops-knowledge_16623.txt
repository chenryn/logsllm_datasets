User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How can Twitter and GitHub be sure that they haven't been hacked? Yesterday, Twitter anounced that they recently identified a bug that stored passwords unmasked in an internal log. Recently, Github also had a similar bug. In both cases, they claim that nobody had access to these files.

Twitter:


  We have fixed the bug, and our investigation shows no indication of breach or misuse by anyone.





  Again, although we have no reason to believe password information ever left Twitter’s systems or was misused by anyone, there are a few steps you can take to help us keep your account safe:


GitHub:


  The company says that the plaintext passwords have only been exposed
  to a small number of GitHub employees with access to those logs. No
  other GitHub users have seen users' plaintext passwords, the company
  said.





  GitHub said it discovered its error during a routine audit and made it
  clear its servers weren't hacked.





  To note, GitHub has not been hacked or compromised in any way.


How can Twitter and GitHub be sure that they have not been hacked or compromised in any way?
Would someone who is compromising a server and read/copy a file always leave traces?

Assistant: They can't be sure. In fact, you can never be sure you haven't been hacked. But a thorough examination can make you conclude that it is more or less likely. 

The Twitter statements only says that there is no indication of a hack. That doesn't exclude the possibility that they were hacked, and in urging their users to change their passwords they implicitly admits that.

As for GitHub, the wording is a bit more categorical. But I think forcing a password reset shows that they understand the risks involved.
