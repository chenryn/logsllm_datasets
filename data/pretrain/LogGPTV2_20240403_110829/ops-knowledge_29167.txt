User: How to batch deploy a web application across multiple servers using Ansible?
Assistant: To deploy web applications in batches on multiple servers using Ansible, the following steps are required: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on the control node (also known as the management node). 2. Configure the host list: specify the target server to be managed in the host list file, and you can use the IP address or DNS name. 3. Write Ansible Playbook: Write an Ansible Playbook file that contains the tasks and actions to deploy the web application. 4. Run Ansible Playbook: run Ansible Playbook on the control node, and specify the target server list to deploy the web application. 5. Perform verification and testing tasks: Verify the deployment results and perform necessary tests to ensure that the web application is functioning properly. 6. Perform maintenance tasks: Periodically perform maintenance tasks to maintain the stability and reliability of the web application. Notes: 1. Make sure that the target server has been configured for SSH access, and the SSH key has been added to the control node. 2. When writing Ansible Playbook, please make sure to use appropriate variables and modules to configure and deploy web applications, such as using the git module to pull code from the code repository, and using the copy module to copy configuration files, etc. 3. When executing Ansible Playbook, please make sure to specify the correct list of target servers, and double check and confirm before execution.
