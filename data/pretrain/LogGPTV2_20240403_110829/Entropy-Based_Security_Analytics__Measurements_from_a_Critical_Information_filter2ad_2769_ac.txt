### System Testing with Operational Radar Traces

The system is tested using operational radar traces from aircraft operations, which are recorded and replayed by the provider. The workload includes the following operations:

- **Flight Data Plan Creation (CRE)**: This allows the operator to create a new flight plan and submit it to the system. The Flight Data Processing Subsystem (FDPS) then calculates the trajectory of the new flight and updates its flight plan.
- **Flight Data Plan Update (UPD)**: An existing flight data plan is retrieved from the system, and its fields are updated.
- **Check Flight Existence (CHK)**: The operator requests to verify if a flight exists in the system, i.e., if a flight data plan has been generated.
- **Flight Position Report Generation (REP)**: This provides the operator with a detailed report about the current position of the selected flight.
- **Flight Control Acquisition (CTA)**: The operator takes control of a flight before its departure.
- **Check Flight Status (STA)**: The operator verifies the status of a flight.
- **Flight Control Transfer (CTT)**: The operator transfers the control of a flight to another Control Working Position (CWP), which controls a different airspace sector. This operation is performed when the flight reaches the sector controlled by another CWP.
- **Flight Re-routing (FRT)**: The trajectory of a flight is modified, for example, when a conflict between two trajectories is detected.
- **Flight Data Plan Removal (REM)**: A flight data plan is removed from the system.

**Note**: For all operations except Flight Data Plan Creation, the targeted flight is randomly selected from the existing ones, i.e., flights that have already been created in the system.

### Reference Information System Architecture

The reference information system's architecture is shown in Figure 6. The system encompasses distributed nodes and multiple heterogeneous log sources, which are addressed through the proposed data analytics framework. The Air Traffic Control (ATC) domain involves several tasks, such as aircraft trajectory monitoring, collision prevention/detection, and air traffic management. ATC has become increasingly software-intensive, involving various networked distributed processes, making it susceptible to both accidental and malicious threats.

#### System Architecture

- **Surveillance Data Processing Subsystem (SDPS)**: Provides information about the status of an airspace over a well-defined geographical area. It processes surveillance data from different sources, such as radar subsystems and weather data. SDPS runs on two different nodes, MS1 and SFN.
- **Flight Data Processor Subsystem (FDPS)**: Responsible for receiving, processing, and updating flight plans. A flight plan contains data such as the expected route, trajectory, and vector-related information. FDPS also allows the visualization of the current position of aircraft, leveraging SDPS information. FDPS runs on the FP1 node.
- **Medium Term Conflict Detection (MTCD)**: Alerts the ATC controller of potential conflicts between flight plans in their area of responsibility. MTCD runs on the MT1 node.

### Log Data and Data Analytics Deployment

The nodes in the reference ATC system provide log files where applications record events during their operations. There are 11 log sources available, listed in Table I by system node. Each log is periodically sampled to compute the log.entropy using the data analytics framework. Dedicated sampler, replacer, column builder, and entropy compute components are deployed for each log source to implement the streaming pipeline.

#### Tuning and Measurement

Measurements are conducted to tune the method, both offline and online. The tuning process involves setting parameters such as the duration of chunks (T) and the number of regular chunks (M-1). The system is run under the described workload to gain insights into the logs. The number of entries per minute generated by the logs is analyzed, and the worst-case log (D02PAN) is used to tune the chunk size. The computation time for log.entropy is evaluated, and T is set to 10 seconds. The value of (M-1) is determined to ensure accurate characterization of the system's behavioral baseline.

### Results

Table II shows the results from the chunk number determination, including the population log.entropy mean (μ), sample mean (x), standard deviation (s), and the number of observations (n) needed to approximate μ at a given accuracy and confidence level. The absolute frequency of the log.entropy values for D02PAN, FP1LNR, and MN1PAN is also provided.

Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the number of entries per minute generated by the logs and the computation time with respect to the chunk size, respectively.

This comprehensive approach ensures that the system is robust and capable of handling the diverse and dynamic nature of ATC operations.
