# Overview of Connection Strings

Connection strings are essential for various operations in Azure Data Explorer, including [management commands](../../management/index.md), the [Kusto API](../index.md), and [Kusto Query Language (KQL)](../../query/index.md) queries. These strings define how to locate and interact with Kusto service endpoints, as well as external resources such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure SQL Database.

## Types of Connection Strings

The following table outlines the different types of connection string formats used in Kusto:

| Format | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Kusto Connection Strings](kusto.md) | Specify how to communicate with a Kusto service endpoint. They follow the [ADO.NET connection string syntax](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-string-syntax). |
| [Storage Connection Strings](storage-connection-strings.md) | Point Kusto to external storage services like Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage. |
| [SQL Connection Strings](sql-authentication-methods.md) | Direct Kusto to an external SQL Server database for querying or [exporting data to SQL](../../management/data-export/export-data-to-sql.md). These adhere to the [SqlClient connection string specification](/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/connection-string-syntax#sqlclient-connection-strings). |

> [!NOTE]
> For information on specifying security principals in connection strings, refer to [Referencing Security Principals](../../management/referencing-security-principals.md).

## Authentication with Connection Strings

To access non-public external storage or SQL Server databases, you must include authentication details in the connection string. For more details, see [Storage Authentication Methods](storage-authentication-methods.md) and [SQL Server Authentication Methods](sql-authentication-methods.md).

## Privacy and Security

It is recommended to prefix any connection string containing sensitive information with an 'h' to obfuscate private data in telemetry. This practice ensures that the confidential parts of the connection string are [obfuscated in telemetry data](../../query/scalar-data-types/string.md#obfuscated-string-literals).

The following table explains how to hide your private information using the 'h' prefix:

| Goal | Method | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hide the entire connection string | Preface the connection string with 'h'. | `h"your_connection_string"` |
| Hide only the secret part of the string | Split the connection string into the resource location and the secret, then add the 'h' between them. | `"resource_location"h"secret_part"` |

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your connection strings remain secure and your data is protected.
