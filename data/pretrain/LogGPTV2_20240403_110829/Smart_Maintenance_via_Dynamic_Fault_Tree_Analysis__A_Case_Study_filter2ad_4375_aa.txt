## Abstract
Urban railway systems, being the most heavily used transportation networks in daily life, frequently experience service disruptions that affect millions of passengers and result in significant economic losses. Traditional maintenance practices, which involve servicing individual devices at fixed intervals, are time-consuming and often ineffective. To address this, we propose a data-driven approach to determine optimal maintenance cycles based on estimating the mean time to failure (MTTF) of the system. This approach faces two key challenges: 1) the higher failure rates of cyber components (e.g., signaling devices) compared to physical components (e.g., power plants), and 2) the functional dependencies between different sub-systems, such as the reliance of trains on the traction power system. We adopt a Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT) analysis for its expressive modeling capabilities and efficient tool support from DFTCalc. Our case study on the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system indicates that the system is likely to fail within 20 days from full functionality based on manufacturer data.

## I. Introduction
The Singapore MRT is one of the world's busiest urban railway systems, with a daily ridership of nearly 3 million. Service disruptions can significantly impact passenger satisfaction. However, the complexity of the system design and the use of many legacy commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products, which are prone to errors and unreliability, lead to frequent disruptions.

Current maintenance practices focus on individual devices, following fixed cycles recommended by manufacturers. This approach is time-consuming and less effective, given the varying failure frequencies of the numerous cyber and physical devices in the system. A more intelligent method to determine maintenance cycles, focusing on the system or sub-systems rather than individual devices, could reduce the frequency of failures.

In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to calculate the MTTF values of the train service and its sub-systems using the MTTF values of individual devices. The primary challenge is modeling the dependability relations among devices and sub-systems. We use a DFT-based approach due to its expressive modeling formalism.

Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a widely adopted technique for reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety (RAMS) analysis in complex systems. DFT extends standard fault trees (sFT) by incorporating sequences, as the order of failures can have different effects on the system. DFT analysis is well-suited for qualitative and quantitative tasks, such as finding minimal cut sets and computing system reliability and MTTF.

Previous work has applied FTA to specific sub-systems in railway systems, but our model is more comprehensive, covering the full operating scenario of the train system, including the onboard sub-system, signal control and communication sub-system, and the traction power sub-system. We focus on service failures, which occur frequently and significantly impact daily operations.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews the basics of DFT modeling and analysis. Section III describes the modeling of the three critical sub-systems and their composition. Section IV presents the analysis of these models, and Section V lists feedback from industry partners. Section VI provides a literature review, and conclusions are drawn in Section VII.

## II. Preliminaries: Dynamic Fault Tree Analysis

### A. Modeling
1. **Basic Events and Gates:**
   - **OR Gate:** Fails if at least one input fails.
   - **AND Gate:** Fails if all inputs fail.
   - **VOTING Gate:** Fails if at least k out of n inputs fail.
   - **PAND Gate:** Fails if all inputs fail from left to right.
   - **SPARE Gate:** Consists of a primary input and spare inputs. When the primary fails, a spare is activated. If no spares are available, the gate fails.
   - **FDEP Gate:** Triggers dependent events when a trigger event occurs. It has a "dummy" output, represented by a dotted line and ignored in calculations.

2. **DFT vs. sFT:**
   - While sFT is often sufficient for modeling complex systems, it requires careful abstraction. For example, in a system with shared spares, sFT models can become cumbersome. DFT, with its ability to model dynamic behaviors, is more intuitive and easier to understand, especially for railway engineers.

### B. Minimal Cut Set
A minimal cut set (MCS) represents the smallest set of component failures that cause the system to fail. MCS computation is crucial for identifying system bottlenecks. We use a top-down algorithm to compute MCS, starting from the top event and expanding cut sets until basic events are reached.

### C. DFTCalc Tool
DFTCalc is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing DFTs. It uses continuous time models where each basic event (BE) has a probability distribution function (f) showing how the failure behavior evolves over time. The tool computes system reliability, MTTF, and availability. Statistical model checking (SMC) techniques enhance the tool's computational power.

## III. System Description and DFT Modeling
A train service relies on the proper functioning of the rolling stock sub-system, the signaling sub-system, and the traction power sub-system. Any disruption in these sub-systems can cause a train service failure, defined as an unexpected stop or major service delay during normal operation.

We conducted a survey on service disruptions in Singaporeâ€™s Circle Line MRT, summarizing the top causes, fines, and affected commuters. Major failures were primarily due to faults in the signaling and rolling stock systems, such as issues with the signal code generator and power trips. Faults in the traction power system led to the longest delays and the most expensive fines.

In this work, we model the traction power system, signaling system, and rolling stock system. For security reasons, we omit confidential details about the system design but describe the key features.

**Assumptions:**
- Only manufacturer data, primarily MTTF values of hardware, is used.
- Operational statistics of hardware devices are incomplete and not used in the analysis.
