Abstract—Urban railway systems, as the most heavily used
systems in daily life, suffer from frequent service disruptions
resulting millions of affected passengers and huge economic
losses. Maintenance of
the systems is done by maintaining
individual devices in ﬁxed cycles. It is time consuming, yet
not effective. Thus, to reduce service failures through smart
maintenance is becoming one of the top priorities of the system
operators. In this paper, we propose a data driven approach that
is to decide maintenance cycle based on estimating the mean time
to failure of the system. There are two challenges: 1) as a cyber
physical system, hardwares of cyber components (like signalling
devices) fail more frequently than physical components (like
power plants); 2) as a system of systems, functional dependency
exists not only between components within a sub-system but
also between different sub-systems, for example, a train relies
on traction power system to operate. To meet the challenges, a
Dynamic Fault Tree (DFT) based approach is adopted for the
expressiveness of the modelling formalism and an efﬁcient tool
support by DFTCalc. Our case study shows interesting results
that the Singapore Massive Rapid Train (MRT) system is likely
to fail in 20 days from the full functioning status based on the
manufacture data.

INTRODUCTION
Singapore MRT is one of the heaviest urban railway
systems in the world according to CoMET1 (Community of
Metros). The system features a daily ridership of nearly 3
million2. A disruption in the system could cause a huge
effect on the service satisfaction. Unfortunately, due to the
complexity of the system design and many legacy COTS
(commercial off the shelf) products, which are error prone and
unreliable, disrupted services happen frequently.
Maintenance of the system is done at the device level
according to ﬁxed maintenance cycles recommended by indi-
vidual manufacturers. It is time consuming and less effective
considering the variant failure frequencies of massive cyber
and physical devices used in the system. However, it is natural
to wonder whether, instead of focusing on maintaining individ-
ual devices, there is a smarter way to decide the maintenance
cycle so as to reduce the frequency of the failures. That is to
say, maintain the system/sub-systems rather than maintaining
individual devices.

In this work, we propose a data driven approach that
calculates the mean time to failure (MTTF) value of the train
service and the sub-systems using MTTF values of individual
system devices. The results can be used to provide maintenance
decision support for MRT operators. The challenges lie in
modelling the dependability relations among devices and also
between sub-systems. Thus, a DFT based approach is adopted
for the expressiveness of the modelling formalism.
Fault tree analysis (FTA) [2] is a widely adopted technique
to perform RAMS (reliability, availability, maintainability and
safety) analysis in complex systems [18], [19]. DFT [3], [8]
brings the concept of sequences into standard fault trees (sFT)
since failures occurring in different orders may have very
different effects on the system. For instance, the P AN D gate
in DFT forces sequences to normal AN D gate in sFT. Unless
the failures happen from left to right, the gate will not output
a failure signal. Although sFT is sufﬁcient to model most
features in a complex system, DFT advances in expressiveness
and readability of the models. A detailed example is shown
in Section II-A2. In addition, DFT analysis is well studied
to perform two main tasks: 1) Qualitative analysis: ﬁnding
the (minimal) cut set of low-level failures causing the top-
level failure [14], [17]; 2) Quantitative analysis: computing the
overall system reliability, mean time to failure of the system
[4], [16] etc..
There are a number of practical experiences of applying
FTA to railway systems. For example, the work in [11] and
[10] applies FTA to a railway level crossing system and the
work in [12] to a signal system in the high speed train.
However, existing work usually studies a single sub-system for
the most hazardous but rare happen events such as collision
or derailment. Their model is considered less complex than
ours where we model the full operating scenario of the train
system which includes the train’s on-board sub-system, signal
control and communication sub-system and the traction power
sub-system. In this work, we take the service failure as the
top level event for analysis as it happens frequently and has
no less importance in daily life.
Organization of the paper is as follows. Section II reviews
the basics of DFT modelling and analysis. Section III describes
the modelling of the three critical sub-systems, i.e., traction
power sub-system, train communication sub-system and rolling
stock sub-system, and the composition of the three models.
Analysis of these models is presented in Section IV while
feedbacks of industry partners on our results are listed as
Questions and Answers in Section V. In the end, Section VI

II. PRELIMINARIES: DYNAMIC FAULT TREE ANALYSIS
A. Modelling
1) Basic Events, Gates: Dynamic fault trees (DFTs) is a
graphic modelling technique that is often used in industry.
It extends the standard fault
trees (sFTs) with modelling
constructs for dynamic behaviours such as sequenced failures.
They are used to model how component failures propagates
to the system failure. The leaves of a DFT are basic events
(BE) which denote certain component failures while the root
is labeled with a top-level event which is the target of anal-
ysis, a system failure. The non-leaves with gates express the
dependence among multiple failures in the system.
Gates consist of one or more inputs, and one output. Figure
1 depicts the DFT gates.

The OR gate fails when at least one input fails.
The AND gate fails when all of its inputs fail.
The VOTING gate fails when at least k out of n inputs
fail.
The PAND gate fails when all of its inputs fail from
left to right.
The SPARE gate consists of a primary input and one
or more spare inputs. At system start, the primary is
active and the spares are in dormant mode. When
the primary input fails, one of the spare inputs is
activated and re- places the primary. If no more spares
are available, the SPARE gate fails. Note that a spare
component can be shared among several spare gates.
The FDEP (functional dependency) gate consists of
one trigger event and several dependent events. When
the trigger event occurs, all dependent events fail. The
FDEP has a “dummy” output, which is represented by
a dotted line and ignored in calculations.

2) DFT vs. sFT: Although in many cases, if proper ab-
straction is applied, sFT is sufﬁcient for modelling complex
systems, it often requires very careful thinking that a slight
difference in the system would yield completely different sFT
models. For example, consider a system composed of two
critical components, C1 and C2, where if any one of them
fails, the system will fail. In order to make the system more
stable, spares are introduced for the components. If each of
the components has its own spare, shown in the DFT model
in Figure 2a, it is intuitive to model the system in sFT by
replacing SPARE gates using AND gates as shown in Figure
2b. However, if a shared spare is used, as shown in Figure 3a,
the same modelling strategy is not feasible, especially in the
case that if C1 fails, spare S is switched on for C1 which
implicates C2 has no spare any more. In this scenario, an
equivalent model in sFT is using a voting gate as shown in
Figure 3b. The resulting sFT model is not straightforward for
users to ﬁgure out the dependability relations between C1,
S, C2. Thus, for the purpose of easy comprehension of the
models and easy communication with railway engineers, we
adopted the DFT approach.
B. Minimal Cut Set
Minimal cut set (MCS) represents the minimal set of
component failures that causes the failure of the whole system.
Computation of MCS is utter important for identifying the
bottlenecks of building a reliable system. For example, it can
be used to ﬁnd the single point failure in a system. In this
work, we use a top-down algorithm [9] for computing it. The
algorithm computes the cut sets of a fault tree starting from the

top event and expands these sets by computing cut sets of each
gate encountered until basic events are reached. For example,
as shown in Figure 4, for an AND gate G1 with basic event
e1 and an OR gate G2 as inputs, where gate G2 takes e2 and
e3 as inputs, event e1 and gate G2 both must occur to enable
gate G1. The cut set starts as {e1, G2}. Furthermore, gate G2
will be enabled when either e2 or e3 occurs. Thus, the cut
set further expanded as {e1,e2} and {e1,e3}. By removing the
redundant elements, the minimal cut set is ﬁnalised as {e1,e2}
and {e1,e3}.
C. DFTCalc Tool
DFTCalc is a powerful tool for modelling and analysing
DFTs. The tool is based on continuous time models that each
BE is equipped with a probability distribution f showing how
the failure behaviour evolves over time, i.e. F(t) represents the
probability that the BE is still running at time point t. The
typical tasks of the tool are to compute the system reliability
of a given DFT, i.e. the probability that the system has not
failed within a given mission time T, the mean time to failure
(MTTF), i.e. the expected time of a failure to occur, and the
availability, i.e. the time that the system is up in the long. The
deployment of statistical model checking (SMC) techniques as
the computation back engine boost up the computation power
of this tool. Interested readers are referred to [1].
III. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND DFT MODELLING
A train service relies on the proper functioning of the
rolling stock sub-system3, the signalling sub-system residing in
control stations and the traction power sub-system at trackside.
Deﬁning the ’train service failure’ as an unexpected stop or
major service delay during normal operation, any disruption in
traction power sub-system, signal communication sub-system
or rolling stock sub-system could cause it.
Besides, we did a survey about service disruption in
Singapore’s Circle Line MRT. Figure 54 summarises the top
causes, ﬁnes and affected commuters of major incidents. It
can be seen from the ﬁgure that major failures are sourced to
faults in signalling system and rolling stock system. Typical
causes are faults in the signal code generator which controls
train speed, power trip etc.. Meanwhile, faults in the traction
3Rolling stock system refers to the train and its onboard train control system.

power system contributed to the longest delays which caused
the most expensive ﬁnes.
Thus, in this work, we model three aforesaid important
sub-systems, i.e., traction power system, signalling system and
rolling stock system.
Meanwhile, for security concerns, in the following sections,
we will skip conﬁdential details about the system design but
describe the interesting features of the system design.
Assumptions: In this work, we have certain settings and
assumptions to clarify. Firstly, only manufacture data is used.
The data mainly consists of MTTF of hardwares, provided
by vendors. Operational statistics of hardware devices are
interesting but not complete enough for our analysis. Secondly,
