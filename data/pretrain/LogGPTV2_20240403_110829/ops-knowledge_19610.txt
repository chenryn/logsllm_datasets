User: I use python Appengine. I'm trying to create a link on a webpage, which a user can click to download a csv file. How can I do this?
I've looked at csv module, but it seems to want to open a file on the server, but appengine doesn't allow that. 
I've looked at remote_api, but it seems that its only for uploading or downloading using app config, and from account owner's terminal.
Any help thanks.
Assistant: Pass a StringIO object as the first parameter to csv.writer; then set the content-type and content-disposition on the response appropriately (probably "text/csv" and "attachment", respectively) and send the StringIO as the content.
