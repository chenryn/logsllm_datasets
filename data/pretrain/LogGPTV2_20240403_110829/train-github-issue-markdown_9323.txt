Hello  
As presented here:  
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38454893/error-in-scipy-wilcoxon-signed-
rank-test-for-equal-series?noredirect=1#comment64315624_38454893  
(without no answer to disprove it as a mistake from me),  
I wish to report that maybe there is a problem with the results of
scipy.wilcoxon signed rank test;
import scipy as sp  
x1=[29.39958, 29.21756, 29.350915, 29.34911, 29.212635]  
sp.wilcoxon(x1,x1,zero_method="wilcox",correction=True)
returns statistic=0.0, pvalue=nan
But with zero_method="pratt", it returns statistic=0.0,
pvalue=0.043114446783075355 instead.  
I think there is a mistake there. The statistics (for z-score, if I am not
mistaken) are the same, but the results are different for the p-value, while
they should not, actually.  
When both series are identical, there should be no good p-value, but this is
confident with alpha=0.05.
Maybe "pratt" zero_method is wrongly implemented. It is said to be more
conservative, but instead it has also constantly given better /lower p-values
on a large array of test values.
