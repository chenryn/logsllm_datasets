I am trying to cmake a C++ project as follows: cmake .. -G Xcode
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/pathto/libtorch
where libtorch was downloaded from here:
https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/nighlty/cpu/libtorch-macos-1.3.0.zip
however, I get the following error:  
mported target "torch" includes non-existent path
    "MKL_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND"
I have installed mkl-dnnl through homebrew, and I suspect the problem is that
libtorch has not updated the name to dnnl? because dnnl.h exists in my
/usr/local/include.
