**What you expected to happen** :
For some enterprise kubernetes/openshift cluster, the admin will set a
cpu/memory limit on container's resource, eg. minimum 400m cpu core, maximum
8Gi memory etc. However, for airflow's auto generated sidecar container for
xcom 'airflow-xcom-sidecar' will fail this requirement as the error shown
above, since the cpu core request is set to '1m' currently,
(https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/kubernetes/pod_generator.py#L60),
as a result, the sidecar container won't be able to start up. Therefore, we
need to have the capability to specify the xcom sidecar resource on
kubernetesPodOperator as a parameter.
**How to reproduce it** :
This error only exist in certain kubernetes cluster that have a restriction on
container's resource. Therefore, the error can be reproduced by manually
setting a resource restriction on admin's level (eg. cpu core request 400m
minimum, etc.). Then use KubernetesPodOperator with xcom enabled, you will be
able to reproduce the error above.
