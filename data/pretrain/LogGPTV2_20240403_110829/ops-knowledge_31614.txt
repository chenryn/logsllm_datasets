User: So I have recently installed Python Version 2.7.5 and I have made a little loop thing with it but the problem is, when I go to cmd and type python testloop.py I get the error: 

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command

I have tried setting the path but no avail.
Here is my path:

C:\Program Files\Python27

As you can see, this is where my Python is installed. I don't know what else to do. Can someone help?
Assistant: Option 1 : Select on add environment var during installation
Option 2 : Go to C:\Users-> AppData (hidden file) -> Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32(depends on version installed)\Scripts
Copy path  and add to env vars path.
For me this path worked : C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts
