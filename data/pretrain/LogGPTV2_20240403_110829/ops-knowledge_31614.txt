I recently installed Python Version 2.7.5 and wrote a small loop script. However, when I try to run the script from the command prompt (CMD) by typing `python testloop.py`, I encounter the following error:

```
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

I have attempted to set the path, but it hasn't resolved the issue. Here is my current PATH setting:

```
C:\Program Files\Python27
```

This is where my Python installation is located. I am unsure what else to do. Can someone help me?

### Solutions

1. **During Installation:**
   - Ensure that you select the option to add Python to the system PATH during the installation process. This will automatically configure the environment variables for you.

2. **Manually Adding to Environment Variables:**
   - Navigate to the Python installation directory. For example, if you have Python 3.8-32 installed, the path might be:
     ```
     C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts
     ```
   - Copy this path.
   - Add the copied path to the system's environment variables. You can do this by following these steps:
     1. Right-click on 'This PC' or 'Computer' on the desktop or in File Explorer and select 'Properties'.
     2. Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
     3. In the System Properties window, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
     4. In the Environment Variables window, find the 'Path' variable in the 'System variables' section and select it. Click 'Edit'.
     5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click 'New' and paste the path you copied.
     6. Click 'OK' to close all windows and apply the changes.

For me, the following path worked:
```
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38-32\Scripts
```

Please replace `YourUsername` with your actual username.

If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about your setup, and I'll be happy to assist further.
