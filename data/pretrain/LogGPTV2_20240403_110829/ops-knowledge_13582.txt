User: I want to start a number of subprocesses in my Python script and then track when they complete or crash.
subprocess.Popen.poll() seems to return None when the process is still running, 0 on success, and non-zero on failure. Can that be expected on all OS's?
Unfortunately the standard library documentation is lacking for these methods...
Is the subprocess module the most suitable to achieve this goal?
thanks
Assistant: Yes to all.
