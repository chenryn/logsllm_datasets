### Title: ARTist - A Novel Instrumentation Framework for Reversing and Analyzing Android Apps and Middleware

The Android Runtime (ART), introduced in Android 5.0, has not received significant attention from the security community. However, its on-device compiler, dex2oat, which largely replaced the Dalvik VM, has created a gap by rendering well-known tools like TaintDroid and its derivatives inapplicable. This shift also presents new opportunities for security researchers.

We have developed ARTist, an Android instrumentation and security toolkit, which is a novel framework that allows for arbitrary code modification of installed apps, the system server, and Java framework code. Similar to existing tools such as Frida and Xposed, ARTist can be used for app analysis and reversing (e.g., recording network traffic, modifying files and databases), as well as for modding and customization. 

However, ARTist stands out in the design space of instrumentation tools for several reasons:
- **Signature Preservation**: It does not break the app signature, allowing modified applications to continue receiving updates without compromising security.
- **Compatibility**: It can be deployed on rooted stock devices starting from Android 6.0.
- **Instruction-Level Instrumentation**: It supports instrumentation at the instruction level.

We provide developers with a module SDK to facilitate the creation of custom instrumentation routines. Since no complex hook systems or additional runtimes are required, ARTist is highly efficient and integrates seamlessly with the compiler's optimization framework.

To demonstrate the versatility of ARTist, we have created a range of modules that showcase different use cases, including:
- Large-scale instrumentation of each method in the system server (over 25,000 methods).
- Precise, targeted injections in third-party apps.
- Full compartmentalization of advertisement libraries.

Our tool is open-sourced and available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Project-ARTist) and [artist.cispa.saarland](https://artist.cispa.saarland). As ARTist is still in its early stages, we welcome feedback and aim to build an active community around it.
