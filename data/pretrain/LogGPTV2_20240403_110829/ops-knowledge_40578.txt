User: In matlab, it is possible to execute a script (ie an m-file) and then manipulate the variables created by the script on the command line.
Is it possible to run a .py file on PyDev and consequently, manipulate its variables inside eclipse as is possible in the case of matlab?
Assistant: Yes, check the run configurations. You can add the script as a "Python Run".
