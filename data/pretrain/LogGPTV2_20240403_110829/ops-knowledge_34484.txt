Question: "You are tasked with performing security testing on a mobile application. Given that this is the first time the app is being tested and time is limited, which testing approach should you request from the development team, and why would this approach be most beneficial?"
 "A": "Request black-box testing access to simulate a real attacker's perspective since this approach is the fastest."
 "B": "Request white-box testing access because it allows for a much faster and thorough analysis due to full knowledge of the app."
 "C": "Opt for gray-box testing since it is the most common kind of testing and balances the number of test cases and speed."
 "D": "Avoid any testing access to the app's source code and rely solely on automated scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities."
Answer: B
