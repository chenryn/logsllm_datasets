Question: A security analyst is reviewing the security controls of a company's Windows infrastructure to prevent adversaries from hijacking SIP and trust provider components. Why would restricting registry permissions alone be insufficient for preventing this type of attack?
"A": "Restricting registry permissions would not stop adversaries from installing malicious content as registry keys related to SIP and trust provider components can still be hijacked.",
"B": "Adversaries cannot modify the registry if permissions are properly set, thus completely securing SIP and trust provider components from being hijacked.",
"C": "The installation of a root certificate does not involve registry modifications, so altering registry permissions would have no impact on trust provider components.",
"D": "Changing registry permissions would prevent the execution of any code, including legitimate updates and system processes, thereby hindering system functionality."
Answer: A
