ABSTRACT
As smart environments become more common, IoT applications
can automate more complex and dynamic activities. Users can de-
fine their activities as abstract workflows and suitable devices will
be selected dynamically to execute them based on user quality of
experience (QoE) requirements. However, many of such applica-
tions violate the principle of least privilege in terms of the allowed
interactions between the IoT devices. We propose an Application-
Centric Access Control (ACAC) framework to enable least privilege
network access control for dynamic workflows while considering
users’ QoE. ACAC enables automatic derivation of an access con-
trol policy for an IoT application and allow this to be adjusted
dynamically as new devices come and go in order to maintain user
QoE.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in Internet of Things
(IoT) applications in smart environments. In 2022 according to Gart-
ner, a typical smart home network will have up to 500 smart devices
[9]. Many IoT cloud-based frameworks, such as Microsoft Flow [8],
have been proposed to manage IoT applications effectively. With
the help of such frameworks, users can automate their activities
easily as workflows. For example, a workflow involving alarm and
coffee maker can be set up to prepare coffee at a coffee time au-
tomatically. Various IoT applications rely upon local cross-device
communications [13].
Existing research has studied how to define user’s activity as
abstract workflows that capture task and structure level, leaving
resource selection to service discovery that determine a set of
specific resources (i.e. IoT devices) for task execution, called con-
crete/execution workflow [10, 11]. This provides ability to the users

to define workflows in a flexible way, and managing dynamic work-
flows easier. Workflows can change dynamically due to many fac-
tors such as user mobility and Quality of Experience (QoE) [3, 4, 7].
For the same example, a workflow may prepare coffee using dif-
ferent coffee maker each time based on user location to improve
user’s QoE. Driven by this understanding, many researchers have
investigated dynamic access control for IoT [5, 6]. However, there
is a lack of research on IoT dynamic access control that supports
dynamic workflows while considering QoE.
In this paper, we will study how to support dynamic workflows
through dynamic network access control policy that follows the
principle of least privilege (PoLP) and satisfies QoE requirements?.
Access Control List (ACL) approach is a common way for access
control, especially in the IoT network [5]. The capability-based
model assigns rights to subjects a prior to its current context [5],
however in ACL model access is granted based on attributes/context
that might be static or change dynamically. Moreover, an ACL model
can be enforced at the network level, this has the benefit that there is
no need to install special libraries on clients such as IoT devices [2].
This is important in the context of IoT where it may be impossible
to modify any program code shippes as part of the device. We argue
that this makes applying an ACL model a practical choice for many
smart homes.
In previous work [1] we have studied automatic ACL generation
for user-defined workflows to maximise user preferences in a static
environment. In this paper, our research focuses on proposing an
IoT security architecture that enables dynamic workflow access
control without seriously affecting users’ QoE. The proposed ar-
chitecture called IoT Application-Centric Access Control (ACAC)
which implies access control decision rely on the application work-
flow dynamic state.
The dynamicity of workflows significantly increase the difficulty
of generating access control policy. To illustrate these challenges let
us consider the example in Figure 1 where two activities modelled
as two workflows must be automated; workflow W1 allows a TV to
audio stream through a speaker, and workflow W2 enables an alarm
clock to trigger a coffee maker. A user is located in a smart envi-
ronment that contains several devices including TV tv1, speaker
(s1, s2), alarm a1, and coffee maker c1.
At time t the activity workflow W1 is realised by TV tv1 and
speaker s1, both located in the living room. Accordingly, the ACL
policy P1 has been generated and enforced to provide connections
between tv1 and s1, and block other connections (Dynamic Access
Control Policy (DACP) is presented in Section 2.3). Then, at time
t + ∆ the second workflow W2 is introduced to automate coffee
preparation. This time, the alarm a1 (in the living room) and the

coffee maker c1 (in the kitchen) are selected for this task. Accord-
ingly, the ACL policy P2 has been generated and enforced to provide
connections between a1 and c1 and block other connections.
However, upon setting up the new workflow W2, due to users’
mobility that leads to changed preference, TV tv1 of workflow W1
needs to stream to the speaker in the kitchen (i.e. s2), instead of s1
in the living room, see Figure 1.
The challenge is how to dynamically update workflow W1 policy
P1 that obeys the PoLP and minimising the impact on QoE. In
particular, P1 policy should block connection conn1 (i.e. tv1 to s1)
and allow connection conn2 (i.e. tv1 to s2). However, this is not
a trivial problem, because there is a trade off between the PoLP
and minimising the interruption during streaming handover. For
example, if conn2 is allowed before the handover, then this violates
the PoLP (tv1 has access to s1 and s2 while it only requires one of
them), see Figure 2(a). On the other hand, if conn1 is blocked before
the handover, this streaming service will be interrupted (i.e. tv1
can’t access s1), as demonstrated in Figure 2(b). Therefore, for an
access control mechanism to support such dynamic workflows it
needs to be aware of workflows changes in the application level.
Motivated by existing technologies that a) enable dynamic work-
flow service discovery that consider user QoE [3] and b) support
dynamic access control which enforces the PoLP [5, 6]. We intro-
duce the following research question what is the proper way to
enforce dynamic access control that obey the PoLP meanwhile not
affecting user’s QoE?. We investigate this question by designing
application-centric access control (ACAC) framework for dynamic

QoE. The proposed ACAC framework introduces an interface be-
tween application level and network access control level, see Figure
3. This channel of interaction enables DACP to enforce access con-
trols while considering to minimise any interruption on ongoing
services on the application level.
