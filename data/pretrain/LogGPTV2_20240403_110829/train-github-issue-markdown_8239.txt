To improve the configuration and activation of your Atom package, consider the following recommendations:

1. **Use a Configuration Schema:**
   - Refer to the "Configuration" section in the [Atom Package Documentation](https://atom.io/docs/latest/hacking-atom-package-word-count) and the [Config API Documentation](https://atom.io/docs/api/latest/Config) for detailed information on how to define a configuration schema. This will help you manage and validate the settings for your package more effectively.

2. **Update Activation Commands:**
   - Instead of using `activationEvents` in your `package.json`, use `activationCommands`. This allows you to specify which commands should trigger the activation of your package.
   - Group the commands by their respective selectors, as shown in the example below:
     ```json
     "activationCommands": {
       "atom-workspace": ["foo:bar", "foo:baz"],
       "atom-text-editor": ["foo:quux"]
     }
     ```

3. **Code References:**
   - The methods `Package.activateConfig`, `Package.activateNow`, `Package.getActivationCommands`, and `Package.hasActivationCommands` are called from the following locations in the Atom source code:
     - `Package.activateConfig` is called 3 times at `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:250:11`.
     - `Package.activateNow` is called at `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:221:14`.
     - `Package.getActivationCommands` is called 1 time at `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:764:9`.
     - `Package.hasActivationCommands` is called at `/Applications/Atom.app/Contents/Resources/app/src/package.js:689:20`.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your package is well-structured and adheres to best practices for configuration and activation in Atom.
