I have reviewed the issues in this repository and believe that my concern is not a duplicate. I would like to iterate over an array and render multiple components or elements within the `Snackbar` component. Here is the code snippet I am using:

```jsx
message={
  {array.map((item, index) => {
    return (
      <MyComponent
        key={index}
        onClick={() => this.handleDelete(item)}
      />
    );
  })}
}
```

This approach works as expected, but I noticed that there is no straightforward way to pass a unique `key` prop to each rendered element, which results in a warning about missing keys. After reviewing the `SnackbarContent.js` file, it seems that this functionality is not currently supported.

Would it be a good idea to submit a pull request (PR) to address this issue? I welcome any thoughts or suggestions on this matter.
