I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a
duplicate.
I would like to map through an array and render multiple components / elements
inside of the Snackbar component.
                        message={
                                {array.map(item => {
                                    return (
                                         this.handleDelete(item)}
                                        />
                                    )
                                })}
                        }
This renders perfectly fine, however I believe there is no way to pass a key
from what I see in the SnackbarContent.js file. This is what gives me the
unique "key" warning. I could make a PR for it if anyone else things that
would be a good idea.
Thoughts?
