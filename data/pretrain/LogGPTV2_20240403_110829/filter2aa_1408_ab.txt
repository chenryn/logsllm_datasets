performed in approximately a two-hour timeframe 
across 28 countries, pointing to a large and 
organised group of money-mules being involved.
It should also be noted that other money-mules will 
likely be used further along the money laundering 
chain, with multiple sets of mules being used to 
obfuscate the source of the stolen funds, and thus 
their total number may be much higher than those 
involved in the initial placement activity.

3.2.2 Risk of money muling
Despite being financially rewarded for their part in carrying-out a successful cyber-
heist, the intrinsic risk associated with a money-mule is significant. In the event of an 
investigation by law enforcement and the authorities after a heist, the actions of the 
money mule are at the front line of the heist. Issues during the money-mule stage have 
led to the ultimate arrest of cyber-group leaders; however, it can often be the case that 
money-mules are the scapegoats, punished for their involvement, whereas the rest of 
the cyber group remain at large4.  
The process of money-muling marks the most physical aspect of an ATM related 
cyber heist, which is why it might be considered to be the weakest link in a cyber-
heist, as well as underlining the risk associated with money-muling at an ATM. CCTV 
cameras that are often present at ATM locations offer the chance to identify and record 
suspicious behaviour and capture facial features that could in some circumstances be 
cross referenced with law enforcement or border control data. The methodologies that 
underpin the various ATM cashout techniques carry certain risks. The lack of a card 
and pin entry associated with the ATM management technique has been noticed as 
suspicious by law enforcement, and has led to the arrest of money-mules. Similarly, 
the speedy draining of cash from ATMs, which were targeted by a FASTCash theft was 
identified as unusual by banking staff and led to the subsequent arrest of money-mules. 
3.2.3 Money-muling interventions
Many initiatives that look to mitigate the risk of successful cyber-heists focus on money-mules. At the end 
of 2019, law enforcement authorities from 31 countries, supported by Europol, Eurojust and the European 
Banking Federation (EBF), came together to support the fifth coordinated global action against money 
muling, with the European Money Mule Action5. In the period between September and November 2019, 
this resulted in the identification of 3833 money-mules alongside 386 money-mule recruiters, of which 
228 were arrested. More than 650 banks, 17 bank associations and other financial institutions helped to 
report 7520 fraudulent money-mule transactions, preventing a total loss of €12.9 million.

3.3 Layering 
Layering is the most substantive phase of the money laundering process, involving multiple steps to 
conceal the origin and ownership of the stolen funds.
3.3.1 What happens after the funds are with the initial money-mule?
Monies withdrawn from ATMs in cyber-heists tend to be immediately exchanged into US Dollars 
at money exchanges. This step in the process could suggest complicity by employees at money 
exchanges to support a money laundering process, albeit via a bribe, or it could indicate negligence. 
Although in some cases the initial money-mules have been caught, in others where the heist has 
been successful, e.g. after the money-mule has withdrawn funds from an ATM, they might be 
passed onto an intermediary who, in turn, passes the stolen funds to the cyber-criminal. However, 
in some instances, especially after cyber-heists relating to nation state actors like the Lazarus 
Group, it might be the case that the fate of these stolen funds is to be channelled via other layering 
techniques in order to further obfuscate the path of the stolen funds.
Out of all attempted Lazarus heists, a subset showed successful fraudulent transactions with a 
majority of transfers being sent to East Asia, where there are numerous linked front companies.

3.3.2 Obfuscation of funds via front companies
The setting up of front companies can be used by some jurisdictions as a method to 
circumvent the adverse impact of imposed sanctions and to enable covert access to 
the global financial system. It also facilitates the potential for obfuscating the flow of 
money and concealing various techniques for money laundering. Front companies 
are corporations that act as a ‘cover’ for the laundering of illicit funds and typically lack 
significant legitimate assets. They either do not maintain active business operations, or, 
in some instances, the front company can have a legitimate purpose, which is used as 
an effective way of concealing the true ownership of businesses and accounts, as well 
as associated assets and parties. In this way, front companies can be an effective entity 
through which illicit transactions can be circulated and consequently obfuscated. Front 
companies are often set up in jurisdictions that are known for strong banking secrecy 
laws or for poor enforcement of money laundering regulations, as these are preferable 
for individuals with illicit intentions. 
3.3.3 Cash businesses
Cash intense businesses can refer to high end luxury goods markets, such as the gold 
market, and the diamond and jewels industries as well as more generic businesses like 
betting shops, casinos, or other services. As these industries transact mainly in cash, they 
can offer a mechanism for laundering the proceeds of a crime. Casinos are significant 
cash businesses and can be used by a launderer to clean cash by converting it into chips 
at a casino, and then exchange it back into cash to deposit at a bank, and have a cheque 
from the casino showing a legitimate transaction. The fact that in some jurisdictions 
names are unregistered and winnings unreported have made casinos an attractive 
method for laundering stolen funds. 
17 // 28
3.3.4 Use of financial representatives
Front companies registered in East Asia are considered to operate on behalf of the 
government of a FATF high risk jurisdiction. In one instance, a front company was 
accused of laundering more than USD$100 million for the sanctioned state-run bank 
of a FATF high risk jurisdiction. Financial representatives using East Asian aliases, 
or in close liaison with facilitators in East Asia, are responsible for setting up and 
operating front companies and bank accounts across the East Asia region. These 
front companies and relationships offer a method of laundering the proceeds from a 
cyber-heist in order to expedite and obfuscate the process of stolen funds being used 
for nefarious purposes, such as purchasing equipment to bypass sanctions. In one 
example front companies import natural resources without making any prepayment. 
These organisations resell the natural resource to customers across Asia, retaining the 
US Dollar proceeds. Rather than sending funds to the FATF high risk jurisdiction, the 
following obfuscation stages occur:
• 
The payments received by this organisation from customers are processed via banks 
in East Asia and diced up into smaller outflows (minus a fee for facilitating the sale). 
This forms part of an intricate layering scheme directed to front companies and 
shipping or trade businesses typically registered in jurisdictions in East Asia. Financial 
representatives are key to establishing the front companies and making the transactions                            
appear legitimate. 
• 
The FATF high risk jurisdiction sends instructions to the front company of items it would like 
to purchase. The front companies then use the received payments to purchase and ship 
commodities. Items purchased can range from bulk commodities, luxury items, electronic 
items as well as equipment. It is assessed that items used could be smuggled with other 
non-suspicious shipments.

3.3.5 Red flags 
Red flags relating to front companies that are involved in illicit financial activity are: 
• 
Financial activity by a front company that has no relevance to its stated area of business
• 
Evidence of shared entities between front companies, including addresses, phones 
numbers, managers and owners
• 
Front companies that lack obvious public activity or presence
• 
Business types cited for front companies involved in illicit activity are often textile, 
garment, fishery, and seafood businesses.
These red flags could assist individuals in financial institutions working on areas of compliance 
like due diligence and KYC screening to better detect front companies used for illicit purposes.
3.3.6 Facilitating jurisdictions
Regulations and conditions that govern company registration and reporting 
requirements in East Asia make the region an attractive place to do business, as well 
as vulnerable to being abused. In some of the region’s jurisdictions, a company’s 
registered office must be there and it is permitted to share an office with their 
company secretary, but neither technically has to operate out of that address. This 
loophole, which would typically be considered as a red flag for money laundering 
investigators, underpins how nefarious activity is facilitated, since it has enabled the 
creation of vast numbers of front companies. This explains why this hub has been 
attractive for heavily sanctioned jurisdictions seeking to access international trading 
markets and to facilitate money laundering.
East Asia can also serve as an effective gateway that offers sanctioned jurisdictions 
access to US Dollars, via clearing services offered from some jurisdictions, potentially 
providing a route that might enable oversight for payments between banks using 
US Dollars to be circumvented. 
3.3.7 Financial transaction recipients 
“The East Asian international financial hub has company formation and 
registration rules that we think need to be stronger…It is important it has 
mechanisms and regulations prohibiting activities that facilitate financial 
transactions with a FATF high risk jurisdiction.”

3.4  Integration
The means and methods by which cyber-criminals choose to convert stolen funds into an usable end product or 
asset can be a useful barometer of the strategic professionalism and experience of the cyber-attack group. It can 
also help the process through which law enforcement agencies might close in on the group.
3.4.1 Cash-out conundrum
The cash out process opted for by cyber-criminals (including those involved in precursor 
steps, money-mules, operating front companies, etc.) can reveal a strong correlation 
between the extravagant ways stolen funds are spent, and the  professionalism of the 
criminal. Operations that were early in a cyber-criminal’s history or were a one-off 
occurrence reveal an immediacy in how stolen funds are used – be it to clear a pressing 
debt or for materialistic acquisition. Such suspicious behaviour could be the first clue in 
linking them to the heist, which could ultimately start a trail that leads to members of 
the cyber-group being identified.

3.4.2 Integration of funds: cyber-criminals 
Some cyber-attack groups have been seen to make many extravagant purchases, 
possibly borne out of inexperience, as it draws the attention of law enforcement agencies 
and often leads to the arrest of the cyber-criminals. An inability to use the funds more 
strategically with less ostentatious purchases is often their undoing. In other cases, the 
methods chosen to cash-out the proceeds of a cyber-heist illustrate greater experience 
and a strategic approach driven by wanting to maintain a low profile. Property and 
jewellery are investments that are likely to hold their value and potentially less likely to 
attract the attention of law enforcement.
3.4.3 Integration of funds: nation state actors 
The independence and freedoms enjoyed by criminal cyber-groups are not shared by 
nation state cyber-groups. Far from their actions leading to materialistic acquisition and 
personal possessions, the purpose of these cyber actors is to fulfil the demands and 
wishes of the regime. 
3.4.4 Reinvesting in criminality
As a final stage of money laundering, cyber-criminals might seek to integrate the
