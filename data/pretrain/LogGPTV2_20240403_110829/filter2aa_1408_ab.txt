### 3.2.1 Overview of Money Mules in Cyber-Heists

The activities described were executed within a two-hour timeframe across 28 countries, indicating the involvement of a large and well-organized group of money mules. It is important to note that additional money mules are likely to be employed further along the money laundering chain. Multiple sets of mules are used to obscure the origin of the stolen funds, making the total number of mules involved significantly higher than those initially identified.

### 3.2.2 Risk of Money Muling

Despite being financially compensated for their role in a successful cyber-heist, the risks associated with being a money mule are significant. In the event of an investigation by law enforcement, the actions of the money mules are often the most visible part of the heist. Issues during the money-mule stage have led to the arrest of cyber-group leaders. However, it is common for money mules to be scapegoated and punished, while the rest of the cyber group remains at large.

The process of money muling is the most physical aspect of an ATM-related cyber-heist, making it a potential weak link. CCTV cameras at ATM locations can capture suspicious behavior and facial features, which can be cross-referenced with law enforcement or border control data. Certain ATM cashout techniques, such as the lack of card and PIN entry, have been noticed as suspicious and have led to the arrest of money mules. Similarly, the rapid draining of cash from ATMs, as seen in FASTCash thefts, has been identified as unusual by banking staff, leading to the arrest of money mules.

### 3.2.3 Money-Muling Interventions

Many initiatives aimed at mitigating the risk of successful cyber-heists focus on money mules. In late 2019, law enforcement authorities from 31 countries, supported by Europol, Eurojust, and the European Banking Federation (EBF), coordinated the fifth global action against money muling, known as the European Money Mule Action (EMMA). Between September and November 2019, this initiative resulted in the identification of 3,833 money mules and 386 money-mule recruiters, with 228 arrests. More than 650 banks, 17 bank associations, and other financial institutions reported 7,520 fraudulent money-mule transactions, preventing a total loss of €12.9 million.

### 3.3 Layering

Layering is the most substantive phase of the money laundering process, involving multiple steps to conceal the origin and ownership of the stolen funds.

#### 3.3.1 What Happens After the Funds Are with the Initial Money Mule?

Funds withdrawn from ATMs in cyber-heists are typically immediately exchanged into US Dollars at money exchanges. This step may indicate complicity by employees at money exchanges, either through bribery or negligence. While some initial money mules have been caught, in successful heists, the funds may be passed to intermediaries who then transfer the stolen funds to the cyber-criminals. In cases involving nation-state actors like the Lazarus Group, the stolen funds may be channeled through other layering techniques to further obfuscate their path.

#### 3.3.2 Obfuscation of Funds via Front Companies

Front companies are often used to circumvent sanctions and enable covert access to the global financial system. These companies act as a cover for laundering illicit funds and typically lack significant legitimate assets. They may not maintain active business operations or may have a legitimate purpose that conceals the true ownership of businesses and accounts. Front companies are often set up in jurisdictions with strong banking secrecy laws or poor enforcement of money laundering regulations, making them ideal for illicit activities.

#### 3.3.3 Cash Businesses

Cash-intensive businesses, such as high-end luxury goods markets, gold, diamond, and jewelry industries, as well as betting shops and casinos, can be used to launder the proceeds of a crime. Casinos, in particular, can be used to clean cash by converting it into chips and then back into cash, with a cheque from the casino showing a legitimate transaction. In some jurisdictions, unregistered names and unreported winnings make casinos an attractive method for laundering stolen funds.

#### 3.3.4 Use of Financial Representatives

Front companies registered in East Asia are often used to operate on behalf of governments in FATF high-risk jurisdictions. In one instance, a front company was accused of laundering over $100 million for a sanctioned state-run bank. Financial representatives using East Asian aliases or working with facilitators in East Asia set up and operate these front companies and bank accounts. These entities facilitate the laundering of proceeds from cyber-heists to expedite and obfuscate the use of stolen funds for nefarious purposes, such as purchasing equipment to bypass sanctions.

#### 3.3.5 Red Flags

Red flags related to front companies involved in illicit financial activity include:
- Financial activity unrelated to the stated area of business
- Shared entities between front companies, including addresses, phone numbers, managers, and owners
- Lack of public activity or presence
- Common business types cited for front companies involved in illicit activity, such as textile, garment, fishery, and seafood businesses.

These red flags can assist financial institutions in detecting front companies used for illicit purposes.

#### 3.3.6 Facilitating Jurisdictions

Regulations and conditions governing company registration and reporting requirements in East Asia make the region attractive for business but also vulnerable to abuse. Some jurisdictions allow companies to share an office with their company secretary, without requiring actual operation from that address. This loophole facilitates the creation of numerous front companies, making the region attractive for heavily sanctioned jurisdictions seeking to access international trading markets and facilitate money laundering.

East Asia can also serve as a gateway for sanctioned jurisdictions to access US Dollars via clearing services, potentially bypassing oversight for payments between banks using US Dollars.

#### 3.3.7 Financial Transaction Recipients

"The East Asian international financial hub has company formation and registration rules that we think need to be stronger... It is important to have mechanisms and regulations prohibiting activities that facilitate financial transactions with FATF high-risk jurisdictions."

- U.S. Treasury’s Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence

### 3.4 Integration

The methods chosen by cyber-criminals to convert stolen funds into usable assets can provide insights into their professionalism and experience. This can also help law enforcement agencies in identifying and apprehending the criminals.

#### 3.4.1 Cash-Out Conundrum

The cash-out process chosen by cyber-criminals, including money mules and operators of front companies, can reveal a correlation between the extravagant use of stolen funds and the professionalism of the criminal. Early or one-off operations often show an immediate use of funds, such as paying off debts or making materialistic acquisitions. Such behavior can be the first clue in linking them to the heist, leading to the identification of cyber-group members.

#### 3.4.2 Integration of Funds: Cyber-Criminals

Some cyber-attack groups have been known to make extravagant purchases, which can draw the attention of law enforcement and lead to their arrest. A more strategic approach, involving less ostentatious purchases, is often indicative of greater experience and a desire to maintain a low profile. Investments in property and jewelry are less likely to attract attention and can hold their value.

#### 3.4.3 Integration of Funds: Nation-State Actors

Nation-state cyber-groups, unlike criminal cyber-groups, do not seek personal gain. Their primary goal is to fulfill the demands and wishes of the regime, rather than engaging in materialistic acquisition and personal possessions.

#### 3.4.4 Reinvesting in Criminality

As a final stage of money laundering, cyber-criminals may seek to integrate the stolen funds back into the criminal economy, often reinvesting in new criminal activities.
