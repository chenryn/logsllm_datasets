while [46], [47] only focused on the marketplaces on the
surface web. We also connected fraud account registration to
the corresponding SIM farms. This intelligence enriches our
knowledge about the e-commerce fraud ecosystem on the deep
web as well as revealing the insights about the relationships
between upstream and downstream miscreants.
Interaction with cybercriminals. Alrwais et al [28] contacted
and traded with bulletproof hosting service providers to gather
ground truth dataset. Levchenko et al [40] purchased products
from spam websites to investigate the miscreants’ bank afﬁliate
and fulﬁllment. The work that is closest to our study introduces
a technique to analyze Craigslist Nigerian scam emails and
automatically reply them with templated emails [43] to trigger
fraud payment notiﬁcation. This approach, however, is not
suitable for our scenario. As the study of [43], most of the
emails for the Craigslist Nigerian scam are generated from
bots, which yields similar messages and behaviors. Hence, the
proposed technique simply based on templates reply cannot be
used for chatting with e-commerce miscreants in our research.
In addition, chatbot have been adopted as an effective way
to combat with cybercrimes. For example, some commercial
tools were reported to interact with online sex buyers [10] to
deliver warning messages and email scammers [14] to exhaust
their time. However, they are not designed for the purpose of
information gathering, which requires the chatbot can actively
guide the conversation. Also, the tools and design details are
not publicly available for evaluation.
X. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst chatbot, Aubrey, for
active threat intelligence gathering from e-commerce fraud-
sters. Aubrey utilizes the question-driven conversation pattern
of small-time workers to model the interaction process as
an FSM, which enables an autonomous conversation. Our
study shows that Aubrey is effective in e-commerce threat
intelligence gathering and helps expose a large amount of
previously unknown, fraud-related artifacts. Our ﬁndings also
bring new insights into the e-commerce fraud ecosystem. Such
understanding and artifacts will help better defend against e-
commerce fraudulent activities.

A. Legal and Ethical Guidelines
APPENDIX
In our research, to minimize the risk may cause to Com-
pany A and its users, as well as the target roles, we follow the
policies guided by Company A and our school IRB.
Guideline of company A and users
• Any interaction with the underground market should not
result in harm to Company A’s user base. In particular, we
should never register accounts with phone numbers from SMS
farms, or log into bulk registered accounts, or purchase bonus
promotion products;
instead, we rely on A to verify the
usability of phone numbers, the authenticity of the credentials
we purchase and the credibility of the bonus-hunting tasks.
• Other data tied to the products and information we collect
should never be accessed outside of Company A’s infrastruc-
ture, requiring the person involved in this study to work on-site
at A and to follow all relevant security practices.
Guideline of target roles
• For the data collected from fraud-dedicated IM groups, we
make a disclaimer notice in the group as following “I may
record the discussions in this group. If you have any concern,
please contact the group owner.”
• For the target roles we interact with, we only make queries
about underground businesses related to them. We should
never ask for personal information. For the online aliases (e.g.
(a) Success case.
(b) Failure case.
(c) No intelligence case.

miscreants will usually leave their traces for promoting their
fake review tasks to recruit small-time workers. The current
Target Finder module can be adapted for analyzing these
traces and recognizing the miscreants. Particularly, the role
classiﬁer will be re-trained using the new corpora (i.e.g, fake
review traces).
FSM generation. Seed conversations between the miscreants
and clients need to be obtained to identify the topics and
transition among topics, which will be used as the states and
state transitions in the FSM. Note that Aubrey provides a semi-
automatic state and transition extraction mechanism, which can
be re-used in FSM generation for fake review.
Dialog management. Suppose we are in the English language
scenario, Dialog Manager needs to distinguish whether the
responses of the fake reviewers are negative, interrogative,
with or without
intelligence. The negative and
interrogative detection is designed for general purpose, which
can be reused in the fake review scenario. Only new module for
identifying fake review related intelligence should be designed
based on the targeted artifacts to be gathered.
the target
C. Chatbot Model Optimization
Here we elaborate two methods to enhance the quality of
our conversational model.
Natural responding. Similar as the ‘disﬂuency’ utterance
(e.g., ‘uhmm’, ‘uh’) introduced in Google Duplex to make
voice conversation more comfortable, we adopt stop sentences
(e.g., “I got it.” and “Ok. Great.”) to make the textual conver-
sation smoother thus less suspicious. These stop sentences are
widely used in IM communications and we extract them from
the IM group chats by ranking the sentences mostly appeared.
We add such stop sentences into the state with targeted threat
intelligence.
Timing control. Timing control is also important to make
the interaction behave naturally. For example, the subjects
will not expect a long utterance can be responded instantly.
Oftentimes, the subjects may split a long sentence into several
messages. Responding with such messages one by one will
not only unnatural but also miss the contextual information.
In our implementation, we wait the subjects for 15 seconds to
ﬁnish the potential multiple inputs. Besides, if the miscreants
do not response Aubrey within certain period of time (e.g.,
two minutes), Aubrey ﬁrst ask a similar question again and
move to the next state after two minutes waiting time.

Font size is proportional to the z-score.
QQ ID) we collected, we will only mention the aggregation
analysis results (e.g. total number of IDs) and will not disclose
the exact ID numbers.
• During the conversation, we should never force the target
subjects to provide any information beyond their will. Our goal
is to observe their natural interaction process with potential
business partners. So neither can we guarantee that we will
collect the information successfully nor can we make sure the
information they provide is reliable.
• To minimize the contribution to cybercrime proﬁt, we should
do our best to pay the least to the miscreants. Speciﬁcally, free
trial should be asked for whenever possible. Also, only the
minimum amount of underground products will be purchased
which are adequate for our study. For the same type of
products, we should purchase the cheapest ones.
B. Example of Aubrey Generalization
In this section, we will demonstrate how Aubrey can be
generalized to chat with the miscreants who recruit small-time
workers to write fake reviews, and to gather threat intelligence
to better understand underground fake review business.
Data collection. Underground discussions about
the fake
review business should be collected in order to extend the
knowledge base of the chatbot. The data can be collected
from dedicated IM groups (e.g. Telegram and WhatsApp) or
underground forums for fake review services in any languages.
Target ﬁnding. To gather invaluable threat intelligence from
one-on-one chat, Aubrey need to ﬁnd the correct
targets,
i.e. the miscreants who recruit small-time workers to write
fake reviews. From the IM groups or underground forums,
