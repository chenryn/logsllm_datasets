User: I have some csv files which are continuously updated with new entries.
I want to write a script to copy those files to another server which is going to copy continuously without any repeating.
How can I manage to do that with a bash, or python script?
Thanks,
Assistant: The rsync command is the right out-of-the-box solution to this problem. From the manpage:

It is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over the network by sending only the differences between the source files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday use.

A simple loop of rsync and sleep will do for you.
