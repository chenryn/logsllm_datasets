Another IP address, "192.0.2.3," within Autonomous System (AS) 64501, is associated with the domain names "bar.example.net" and "baz.example.org." These three domain names, including "foo.example.com," are defined as related domains (rDomains), and we extract their features. The extracted features are categorized into three subsets: Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) strings, n-grams, and top-level domains (TLDs).

**FQDN String Features (Nos. 39–41 in Table II):**
- **Number of FQDNs (No. 39):** The total count of FQDNs in the rDomains.
- **Mean Length of FQDNs (No. 40):** The average length of the FQDNs.
- **Standard Deviation (SD) of FQDN Lengths (No. 41):** The variability in the lengths of the FQDNs.

**N-gram Features (Nos. 42–50 in Table II):**
- These features are derived from the frequency of n-grams (n = 1, 2, 3) in the set of rDomains.
- **1-grams (Nos. 42–44):** Mean, median, and SD of the occurrence frequency of single characters.
- **2-grams (Nos. 45–47):** Mean, median, and SD of the occurrence frequency of pairs of characters.
- **3-grams (Nos. 48–50):** Mean, median, and SD of the occurrence frequency of triplets of characters.

**TLD Features (Nos. 51–55 in Table II):**
- **Distinct Number of TLDs (No. 51):** The count of unique TLDs in the rDomains.
- **Ratio of .com TLD (No. 52):** The proportion of .com TLDs in the rDomains.
- **Mean, Median, and SD of TLD Frequency (Nos. 53–55):** The mean, median, and SD of the occurrence frequency of TLDs.

**Step 3: Applying Machine Learning:**
- This step involves applying a machine learning algorithm to the features extracted in Step 2. The goal is to detect or predict potentially malicious domain names.
- We use supervised machine learning, which consists of two phases: training and testing.
  - **Training Phase:** A learning model is generated using labeled data (malicious and legitimate domain names) with the extracted features.
  - **Testing Phase:** The model predicts the maliciousness of input domain names based on the extracted features.
- We selected the Random Forest algorithm due to its high accuracy and scalability, as demonstrated in preliminary experiments. A Random Forest consists of multiple decision trees, each constructed from randomly sampled features. The final prediction is determined by the majority vote of the decision trees.

**IV. Evaluation:**
- **Dataset:**
  - **Target Domain Names (Training and Test Sets):** 
    - **Legitimate-Alexa:** FQDNs extracted from Alexa's top 100,000 domain names, verified for legitimacy.
    - **Malicious-hpHosts:** FQDNs extracted from hpHosts, verified for maliciousness.
    - **Test Set:** Used to evaluate the predictive performance, with no overlap with the training set.
  - **Web Client-Based Honeypot Datasets:**
    - **Honeyclient-Exploit:** FQDNs of websites distributing browser exploits.
    - **Honeyclient-Malware:** FQDNs of malware distribution sites.
  - **Sandbox Datasets:**
    - **Sandbox-Malware:** FQDNs connected to malware samples.
    - **Sandbox-C&C:** FQDNs of command and control (C&C) servers.
  - **Professional Datasets:**
    - **Pro-C&C:** FQDNs of C&C servers.
    - **Pro-Phishing:** FQDNs of phishing websites.
- **Parameter Tuning:**
  - **Time Window Size:** Optimal size determined through 10-fold cross-validation, resulting in a two-day window.
  - **Random Forest Parameters:**
    - **Number of Decision Trees:** Determined through tuning.
    - **Number of Sampled Features:** Determined through tuning.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **True Positive (TP):** Correctly predicted malicious domain names.
- **False Positive (FP):** Incorrectly predicted legitimate domain names.
- **False Negative (FN):** Incorrectly predicted malicious domain names.
- **True Negative (TN):** Correctly predicted legitimate domain names.
- **True Positive Rate (TPR/Recall):** Ratio of correctly detected malicious domain names to actual malicious domain names.
- **Precision:** Ratio of actual malicious domain names to those detected as malicious.
- **True Negative Rate (TNR):** Ratio of correctly determined legitimate domain names to actual legitimate domain names.
- **F-measure:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
