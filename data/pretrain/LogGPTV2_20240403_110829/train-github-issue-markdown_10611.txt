Currently, we support "GCEPersistentDisk," which is exposed via the API. I am working on adding support for AWS EBS, which is functionally similar to GCEPersistentDisk.

I'm considering two approaches:

1. **Add a new type, `AWSPersistentDisk`:** This would be a straightforward extension, but it could lead to code duplication and a more complex API.
2. **Generalize `GCEPersistentDisk` to support multiple cloud providers:** We could rename `GCEPersistentDisk` to something like `CloudPersistentDisk` to make it applicable to any cloud-block device, including EBS and Cinder.

On EC2, EBS volumes are tied to a specific Availability Zone (AZ). Therefore, even if we introduce `AWSPersistentDisk`, we will need a "cloud location" specifier (e.g., `cloudLocation: us-west-2b`). If we go this route, it might make sense to use a more detailed specifier, such as `cloudLocation: aws/us-west-2b`.

My preference is to have a single `PersistentDisk` type that can handle all cloud providers. This approach would reduce code duplication and simplify the API, making it easier to consume and maintain.
