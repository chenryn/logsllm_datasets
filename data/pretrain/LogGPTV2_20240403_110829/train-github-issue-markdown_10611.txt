Currently we have "GCEPersistentDisk", and this name is exposed via the API. I
am working on adding support for AWS EBS, which is very similar to
GCEPersistentDisk.
Should I add another type AWSPersistentDisk, or should we try to make
GCEPersistentDisk work for any PD/EBS/Cinder style cloud-block device? (And
presumably rename GCEPersistentDisk to CloudPersistentDisk or something
similar)
On EC2, EBS volumes are bound to a specific AZ, so I think we'll likely have a
"cloud location" specifier even if we have AWSPersistentDisk (cloudLocation:
us-west-2b). I'm thinking if we're going to do that, we might as well have
"cloudLocation: aws/us-west-2b", in which case there seems less reason to have
the different types.
My personal preference would be to have one PersistentDisk type for all the
clouds, to avoid code duplication; it also feels like a simpler API to
consume.
