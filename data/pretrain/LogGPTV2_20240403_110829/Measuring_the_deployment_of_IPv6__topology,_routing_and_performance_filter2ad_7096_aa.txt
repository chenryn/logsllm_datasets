## Abstract
We analyze the growth, structure, dynamics, and performance of the evolving IPv6 Internet using historical BGP data and recent active measurements, comparing these trends to the evolution of IPv4. Our findings indicate that while the IPv6 network is maturing, its adoption is still slow. Core Internet transit providers have largely deployed IPv6, but edge networks lag behind. Early IPv6 deployment was more robust in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region compared to North America, a pattern that persists. The IPv6 topology is dominated by a single player, Hurricane Electric, which appears in a significant fraction of IPv6 AS paths and is more prominent than the most dominant player in IPv4. Routing dynamics in IPv6 are similar to those in IPv4, with churn rates growing at the same pace as the underlying topologies. Performance over IPv6 paths is comparable to IPv4 when the AS-level paths are the same, but can be much worse if the AS-level paths differ.

## 1. Introduction
The Internet operations, engineering, and research communities are increasingly focusing on IPv6, a protocol designed to address the architectural limitations of IPv4, particularly the limited address space. The global Internet address allocation architecture relies on a free pool of IP addresses, and the exhaustion of unallocated IPv4 addresses has driven widespread adoption of IPv6. Major network operators and content providers are deploying IPv6, and some governments are mandating support. However, there is limited empirical data on the maturity of the IPv6 network in terms of composition, topology, routing, and performance.

While IPv6 penetration remains small compared to IPv4, the IPv6 network topology has shown distinct growth phases. For both ASes and AS links, an initial linear growth (y = ax + b) followed by exponential growth (y = ae^(bx)) provides the best fit, with the change in trajectory occurring around 2008. This shift suggests that IPv6 may be transitioning from an experimental phase to a production-ready network. Key questions include: Which network types and geographic regions contribute the most? Does the growing IPv6 network converge toward the existing IPv4 network? How do routing dynamics in IPv6 compare to IPv4? Does performance over IPv6 paths approach that over IPv4 paths?

In this study, we use historical BGP archives and recent active measurements to analyze the state of IPv6 deployment along three dimensions: topology, routing, and performance. We find that the IPv6 network is maturing, as indicated by its increasing similarity in size and composition, AS path congruity, topological structure, and dynamics to the public IPv4 Internet. Core Internet transit providers have mostly deployed IPv6, but edge networks are lagging. While all geographic regions show exponential growth in IPv6 adoption, early deployment was stronger in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The IPv6 network is characterized by the presence of a single prominent player, Hurricane Electric, which appears in a significant fraction of IPv6 AS paths. Routing dynamics in IPv6 are largely similar to those in IPv4, with churn rates matching the underlying topology growth. In terms of performance, IPv6 data-plane performance closely matches IPv4 when AS-level paths are the same, but can be significantly worse when they differ.

## 2. Datasets and Methods
We use a variety of data sources and analysis methods, summarized here and detailed in subsequent sections. Our analysis of the IPv6 Internet's size, routing behavior, and structure relies on publicly available historical BGP tables. We also use BGP updates from public repositories to analyze routing dynamics over time. Active measurements from five vantage points around the world help us compare and correlate IPv4 and IPv6 performance with other growth parameters.

### BGP Topology Data
We collected historical BGP data from RouteViews and RIPE, the two major public repositories. These sources provide data from 1998 for IPv4 and from 2003 for IPv6. To filter out transient and backup links, we apply a "majority filtering" method, collecting AS paths seen in a majority of five samples over a three-week period. We generate topology snapshots every three months, resulting in 56 snapshots for IPv4 and 36 for IPv6.

### BGP Routing Dynamics Data
Our comparative analysis of routing dynamics is based on BGP updates from Routeviews6 for IPv6 and Oregon-IX for IPv4. We use monitors from five networks: AT&T, Hurricane Electric, NTT-America, Tinet, and IIJ. We remove updates caused by session resets using a method developed by Zhang et al. [15].

### AS Relationships
We use Gao’s AS relationship classification algorithm [7] to infer the business relationships associated with each inter-AS link, focusing on customer-provider and settlement-free peering links.

### AS Classification
We classify ASes according to their expected business type using a machine learning decision tree classifier. The method uses the average number of customers and peers over the AS's lifespan. We classify ASes into four classes: Enterprise Customer (EC), Small Transit Provider (STP), Large Transit Provider (LTP), and Content/Access/Hosting Provider (CAHP), with an accuracy of 85%.

This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of IPv6 deployment, offering insights into its growth, structure, and performance.
