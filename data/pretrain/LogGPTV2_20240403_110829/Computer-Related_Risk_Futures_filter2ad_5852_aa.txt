# Computer-Related Risk Futures

**Author:** Peter G. Neumann  
**Conference:** 2009 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference

## Abstract
This paper examines the various risks associated with the development and use of computer-related systems. It reflects on past and future alternatives, suggests remedial approaches, and offers broad conclusions. The need for holistic and proactive strategies is more urgent than ever.

**Keywords:** Risks, Trustworthiness, Security

## 1. Introduction
The term "futures" in the title of this paper is intentionally ambiguous. On one hand, it can refer to strategic visions of future times where risks are controlled, managed, or even eliminated through various means. On the other hand, it can suggest reactive, business-as-usual interpretations, such as trading in expectations related to risks, perhaps using actuarial tables to issue, buy, and sell insurance policies against computer-related disasters, or speculating by short-selling stocks in anticipation of malware exploitations and cyberattacks.

Proactive strategies should appeal to enlightened individuals in R&D and operational communities, while reactive strategies might attract primarily financial market speculators and short-term profit seekers. This paper recommends the former approach and dismisses the latter as a misguided strategy that needs to be addressed early.

This author and colleagues, including Bob Boyer, Fernando Corbat√≥, Peter Denning, Edsger Dijkstra, Virgil Gligor, Tony Hoare, Nancy Leveson, J Moore, David Parnas, John Rushby, and Jerry Saltzer, have long advocated for principled approaches to reduce risks. Unfortunately, much of this shared wisdom has been largely ignored in practice over the past 40 years. It is essential to respect this wisdom and hope that it will eventually gain greater traction, particularly in raising awareness about the risks of inaction.

## 2. Historical Perspective
Many critical applications, such as infrastructure, real-time control, and computer-aided elections, require trustworthy computer systems that meet stringent security and reliability requirements. However, many existing systems fall short of these standards. Overcoming the lack of meaningfully trustworthy systems is only part of the problem, as many issues have nontechnological aspects. The risks continue to be problematic, with expanding uses, increasing demands for automation, growing technological complexity, and adversaries outpacing defenders.

Risks that violate trustworthiness requirements recur, suggesting a lack of foresight. For example, see 33 years of ACM SIGSOFT's Software Engineering Notes, 24-plus years of the ACM Risks Forum, and the book "Computer-Related Risks" for numerous examples. The series of Inside Risks columns in the Communications of the ACM succinctly summarizes many of these risks.

A sample set of problems from this source material appears in the author's 2006 ACSAC paper on the risks of untrustworthiness, which considers unreliable backup, nonrobust networking, and systems that are unsafe, unsecure, or both.

Reflection on the RISKS archives reveals several observations. The first issue (Volume 1, Number 1) on August 1, 1985, noted hot topics such as the relationship of computer systems to money, privacy, and elections, and anticipated risks in defense systems, human safety, consumer protection, and healthcare. It included items on the Strategic Defense Initiative, program bugs in automobile recalls, and heart pacemaker problems.

In crafting expectations for the future, the first issue reported on money losses, security problems, and potential misuses in elections, suggesting opportunities for Trojan Horses and fraud. The vulnerabilities in various computerized voting systems were highlighted, noting that about 60% of votes were counted by computer programs, with over a third being counted by a single program. This system could be undetectably manipulated to modify election results.

Historical data points, such as articles by Ronnie Dugger in The New Yorker and The Nation, reflect the lack of fundamental progress and the continuing lack of integrity in all-electronic (paperless) voting systems.

The RISKS archives are replete with thoughtful items on risks that needed to be addressed, including security and privacy, reliability and safety, and human well-being. Many cases involve poor system development and software engineering practices, poorly designed human interfaces, human errors, and malicious misuse. Few topics of concern today were unanticipated, at least conceptually.

Topics such as anti-missile missile systems, power outages, safety risks in aviation, railroads, process control systems, nuclear power, healthcare, and security and privacy problems are still discussed. The belief in off-the-shelf products being sufficiently trustworthy has been contradicted by empirical evidence.

Over the years, local security and privacy problems have become more global, affecting new contexts such as health care, distributed systems, web servers and browsers, cloud computing, and previously isolated systems in national infrastructures. We have widespread cases of malware, identity fraud, spam, phishing attacks, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. There is also increasing awareness that cryptographic algorithms alone are inadequate for solving security problems and must be embedded in trustworthy hardware and software.

Common themes include usability problems resulting from poorly conceived human interfaces, blame placed on system operators and users rather than designers, and short-sighted local optimization leading to avoidable risks. Many issues, such as long-term enterprise survival and privacy, are often ignored.

The risks discussed in the author's 1995 book, "Computer-Related Risks," are still recurring, and many recommendations remain relevant but unheeded. Far-reaching proactive measures are urgently needed, although this is not a new conclusion. Reports from the National Research Council, such as "Multilevel Data Management Security" (1983), "Computers at Risk" (1990), "Trust in Cyberspace" (1998), and "Toward a Safer and More Secure Cyberspace" (2007), reiterate the need for such measures.

## 3. Some Pressing Problems
Consider a few representative pandemic problem areas that encompass a variety of application scopes, complexities, and potential risks:

### Critical Infrastructures
The 1965 Northeast power blackout and subsequent similar events highlight the vulnerability of critical infrastructures to attacks on survivability, integrity, and security. In 2009, vulnerabilities in power distribution and other national critical infrastructures were reported as widespread and easy to exploit. Computer systems controlling power grids have been victimized by trap doors and Trojan horses, and the ability to detect, diagnose, and respond to attacks and outages is inadequate.

### Malware
Perhaps the most pervasive risks involve the continued lack of trustworthiness in critical information system and network infrastructures. The Conficker malware suite, which emerged in 2009, exploited unpatched operating systems and represented some of the most sophisticated malware seen. The potential for more serious consequences, including financial ruin, corporate demise, clandestine surveillance, phishing attacks, and massive identity fraud, remains untapped. Flaws such as buffer overflows, overly permissive .rhosts files, and easily compromised reusable passwords are still rampant two decades later.

### Electronic Voting
Elections are a critical infrastructure for maintaining democracy, but irregularities are as old as elections themselves. Serious vulnerabilities exist in election processes, and the move toward all-electronic systems after the 2000 U.S. national election has exacerbated the overall lack of election integrity. Proprietary paperless electronic systems have pervasive security vulnerabilities, almost no meaningful accountability, and inadequate oversight and governance. These systems have led to inequities in voter registration, sloppy management of registration databases, and politicization of election processes. A recent example involves the 2009 indictments of five people in Kentucky for conspiracy to commit vote fraud, extortion, and tampering with grand jury witnesses.
