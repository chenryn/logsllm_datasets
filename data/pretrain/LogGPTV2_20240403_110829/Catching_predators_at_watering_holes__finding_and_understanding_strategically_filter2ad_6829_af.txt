### Customization and Deployment of ScanBox

The ScanBox tool, as observed on mss.ca, has been extensively customized by APT actors to target different victims. After reconnaissance, the collected information is transmitted to Command and Control (C&C) centers via GET and POST requests (Table 9). The C&C domains identified include legitimate ones (e.g., ntxeye.com), malicious domains (e.g., foundationssl.com), and static IP addresses. Additionally, some ScanBox attacks reported by URLQuery, a free web scanning tool, utilized Dynamic DNS (DDNS).

ScanBox also encrypts certain URL arguments and periodically sends status update requests to the C&C when visited. Notably, mss.ca was compromised as early as late 2014, according to URLQuery. Our dynamic crawler, using university campus IP addresses, initially failed to detect any suspicious activities. However, upon relocating the crawler to a supercomputing center in San Diego, CA, we discovered ScanBox reconnaissance code in the HTTP traffic, suggesting that the attackers may be targeting industry users.

### Live Infiltration and Monitoring

In our dataset, gokbayrak.com was reported as a watering hole by a blog [30], likely compromised with the ScanBox framework. We performed live monitoring on this domain and found that it redirected visitors to several suspicious third-party domains. One such domain, theguardian.com.tw, was available for purchase, and we anonymously acquired it to sinkhole the domain. We hosted the domain on an Amazon cloud using an Apache web server to log all traffic from June 26 to August 16, 2015.

By analyzing the collected traffic logs and checking request referrals, we identified two additional unreported watering holes: ibsahq.org (International Buddhism Sangha Association) and HNN.hk (a Chinese news agency). These sites had similar infections and redirected visitors to other malicious domains, as indicated by the Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) in Table 5. Over three months, the sinkhole collected HTTP traffic from approximately 7,000 unique IP addresses, primarily from Turkey, Taiwan, and the USA.

### Summary of Findings

Our research highlights the active involvement of APT actors in compromising politically oriented websites, employing various techniques (e.g., cookies) to track and identify visitors. However, these attacks are less stealthy compared to industry-specific attacks, which may only target individuals from certain organizations. A web scanner tailored to the unique features of such websites could lead to new discoveries and enhance security. Additionally, our findings indicate that these target sites often have weaker security measures compared to industry sites. Enhancing the security awareness of site owners and seeking professional assistance can significantly reduce the likelihood of such attacks.

### Evasion Techniques in Industry-Specific Attacks

For attacks targeting industry, the use of legitimate intermediaries is a notable feature. This technique, particularly in corporate environments, can help evade detection, as redirection to unknown external domains might raise alarms. Unusual relationships between unrelated but legitimate domains, if rarely observed, could warrant closer scrutiny. Further research should explore technologies that leverage such observations to detect and mitigate these types of attacks.

### Related Work

#### Understanding Website Compromise
A recent study [61] showed that websites using specific content management systems (e.g., WordPress or Joomla) or running particular web servers are at higher risk of compromise. Moore et al. [49] revealed that attackers use search engines to find and exploit vulnerable sites for phishing campaigns. John et al. [36] and Leontiadis et al. [41] detailed how compromised sites are used to boost the search rankings of malicious sites. Canali et al. [26] provided insights into attackers' behavior post-compromise. It has also been noted that many web hosting providers do not respond promptly to compromises, allowing attackers to exploit compromised sites for extended periods [27].

#### Outlier Detection
To redirect visitors to malicious sites or deliver malware, attackers must manipulate web content, leading to detectable changes. Our system identifies such changes and highlights outliers based on historical data. Various techniques can be used for this purpose [20, 25, 50]. We employ a simple outlier detection method using probabilistic models and confidence intervals, which effectively captures the types of changes we are interested in.

#### Pre-Filtering Systems
EvilSeed [35] is a pre-filter that generates search queries to identify similar malicious pages. Eyeson, however, does not require a seed of known malicious pages and can discover unknown ones. Eyeson outperforms EvilSeed in terms of toxicity, as discussed in Appendix A. Prophiler [28] and Delta [24] are content-based pre-filtering systems that analyze static features and changes in page structures. These approaches can be evaded if page content is obfuscated. In contrast, Eyeson profiles the evolution of a target using lightweight features from HTTP headers, enabling large-scale inspection.

#### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
APTs are well-funded, carefully orchestrated campaigns that pose serious risks to commercial and governmental organizations. Existing work focuses on dissecting APT campaigns [46, 39, 42, 60] and developing mechanisms to assess the threat of targeted malware [33] and link different attacks [40]. While these studies focus on spear-phishing emails, our research examines the increasingly popular tactic of watering hole attacks.

### Conclusion

Our work contributes to the understanding and mitigation of strategic website compromise, a growing vector for delivering malware in targeted campaigns. By analyzing over five years of data from archive.org and labeling ground truth using public sources, we discovered 17 previously unreported watering holes, including a high-impact politically motivated attack. Our findings shed light on APT actors' motivations, strategies, and techniques. Future research will build on these findings to further enhance our methodology, Eyeson, and explore its potential as a pre-filtering system for organizations under APT threat.

### Appendices

#### A. Eyeson 2.0

Eyeson, in its current state, served as a measurement methodology in our research, helping us quickly focus on highly likely watering hole cases. It has the potential to be deployed in a corporate environment as a pre-filtering mechanism after improvements and performance evaluations.

**Evaluation:**
Using ground truth collected in Section 3.2, we bootstrapped the profile for each monitored URL with 10 visits and ran Eyeson over all snapshots with confidence levels ranging from 90% to 99%. The false positive rate ranged from 19.7% to 19.3%, while false negatives remained at zero (Figure 3). Running Eyeson on a larger set of collected HTTP traffic with a 95% confidence interval resulted in alerts for 56,300 monitored URLs. Post-filtering validation confirmed the compromise of 8.2% of these URLs. Over a five-year period, Eyeson had a toxicity level of 4.1% of total alerted visits, outperforming EvilSeed in terms of toxicity (Table 10).

**Evasion:**
Eyeson's profile features capture anomalies in HTTP requests when a site is compromised. While an attacker can manipulate one feature, it is challenging to control all features simultaneously, making evasion difficult.

#### B. Archive Data

To monitor long-term changes to a website, we leveraged archive.org, which intermittently crawls URLs and maintains snapshots. To visit an archived snapshot, one can render the corresponding archive URL in a browser, which displays the archived visit and embedded URLs. For example, to visit a snapshot of forbes.com captured on November 28, 2014, one can browse http://web.archive.org/web/20141128132335/http://www.forbes.com/. Table 12 shows a sample of the generated data.

**Visits and Changes:**
- Total Visits: 1.7M
- Monitored URLs: 56.3K
- Validated Alerts: 69.8K
- Confirmed Compromised URLs: 4.6K

This data provides a comprehensive view of the changes and anomalies detected by Eyeson.
