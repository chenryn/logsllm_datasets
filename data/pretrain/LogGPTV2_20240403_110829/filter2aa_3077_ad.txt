# Bitbucket Permissions Overview

Bitbucket permissions are categorized into four main levels: Global, Project, Repository, and Branch. Each level has distinct access controls, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions for their roles.

## Permission Levels

### 1. **Global Permissions**
- **Description:** Controls who can log in to Bitbucket, who is a system admin, and other high-level administrative roles.
- **Reference:** [Bitbucket Global Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/global-permissions-776640369.html)

### 2. **Project Permissions**
- **Description:** Grants read, write, and admin permissions at the project level (groups of repositories).
- **Reference:** [Bitbucket Project Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-project-permissions-776639801.html)

### 3. **Repository Permissions**
- **Description:** Provides read, write, and admin permissions on a per-repository basis.
- **Reference:** [Bitbucket Repository Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-repository-permissions-776639771.html)

### 4. **Branch Permissions**
- **Description:** Allows write (push) access on a per-branch basis.
- **Reference:** [Bitbucket Branch Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html)

## Branch Permissions Details

| **Name** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Prevent all changes** | Prevents pushes to specified branches and restricts creating new branches that match the branch or pattern. |
| **Prevent deletion** | Prevents branch and tag deletion. |
| **Prevent rewriting history** | Prevents history rewrites on specified branches, e.g., by force push or rebase. |
| **Prevent changes without a pull request** | Prevents pushing changes directly to specified branches; changes are allowed only with a pull request. |

## Access Token Scopes

Access tokens in Bitbucket are restricted to use with projects and repositories, unlike some other SCM systems like GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Enterprise.

## Bitbucket REST API

The Bitbucket REST API enables users to perform various actions, such as interacting with projects, repositories, access tokens, SSH keys, and more. Full documentation is available [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/bitbucket/reference/rest-api/).

## Attack Scenarios

### Reconnaissance
- **Repository Reconnaissance:** Search for repositories containing specific terms, e.g., "cred".
- **File Reconnaissance:** Search for files with specific names, e.g., "jenkinsfile".
- **Code Reconnaissance:** Search for secrets within code, e.g., "API_KEY".

### Promoting User to Admin Role
- **Web Interface:** Check the "Admin" checkbox next to the user.
- **REST API:** Use the Admin User Permissions REST API to add a user to the admin role.

### Maintain Persistent Access
- **Personal Access Token:** Create a personal access token scoped to interact with projects and repositories.
- **SSH Key:** Add an SSH key to maintain access to Bitbucket.

### Modifying CI/CD Pipeline
- **Bamboo Integration:** Modify the Bamboo configuration file (bamboo.yaml) to add an SSH key to the server where the Bamboo agent is running.

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Reconnaissance Logging:** Increase the logging level to log search queries.
- **Role Change Logging:** Log changes via the access log and audit log.
- **Persistent Access Logging:** Log the creation of personal access tokens and SSH keys.

## SCMKit

SCMKit is a proof-of-concept tool developed by X-Force Red to leverage the REST API functionality of common SCM systems. It supports reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and persistence modules for GitHub Enterprise, GitLab Enterprise, and Bitbucket Server.
