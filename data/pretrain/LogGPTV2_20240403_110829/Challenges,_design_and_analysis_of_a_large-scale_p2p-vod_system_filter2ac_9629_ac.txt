Figure 2: PDFs of the interarrival times of Movie 1,
2 and 3.
Figure 2 represents the probability density functions (PDFs)
of the interarrival time distributions of Movie 1, 2 and 3.
From the ﬁgure, we can observe that Movie 2 is the most
popular movie (also can be veriﬁed by data in Table 3) and
the average interarrival time between viewers is about 7.25s,
while the interarrival times for Movie 1 and 3 are 19.07s and
7.25s respectively.
We can easily represent the PDF of the interarrival time
by a simple mathematical model. In here, we use the fol-
lowing function to approximate the PDF:
f (t) = atb
where a > 0, b  120  min.
 60 − 120 min.
 30 −  60  min.
 15 −  30  min.
   5 −  15  min.
   0 −   5   min.

users tend to watch Movie 1 with a higher viewing
duration.
• Most of the viewing duration of the MVRs are short,
e.g., less than 10 minutes.
• There is a high percentage (e.g., over 70%) of users
who stay in the P2P-VoD system for longer than 15
minutes. This is signiﬁcant because even though the
duration of an viewing action is short, but since peers
stay in the system for a long duration, they still assist
each other in viewing movie, and this translates to
good system scalability.
• From the above two points, we infer that when users
start the P2P-VoD client software, they probably ﬁrst
quickly scan a few movies or programmes until they
ﬁnd an interesting one and continue to watch that
movie; or just leave the system if nothing is of their
interest. This process would cause a large number of
short duration MVRs. After they ﬁnd a movie that
they are interested in, they might watch it for a long
duration, and this could explain why there is a certain
fraction of users stay in the system for more than one
hour.
Figure 6 illustrates the CDF of the viewing position of
MVRs in these three movies. Since users who watch Movie
2 are more likely to jump to some other positions than users
who watch Movie 1 and 3, the probability that a viewing
action starts from the beginning of Movie 2 is relatively low.
Another important observation is that beside the starting
position 0, the landing points of various jump operations is
uniformly distributed. This implies that one can uniformly
space the anchor points and these measured data provide
developers a strong hint on designing the proper chunk se-
lection algorithm.

4.2.3 Analysis of peer population watching a movie
One important data that the system needs to keep track
is the viewer population size and how it varies in time. We
carried out the measurement from 00:00, December 24, 2007
to 23:00, December 29, 2007 (total of six days). To reduce
the size of the collected data, sampling is carried out in an
hourly basis.
Figure 7 shows the total number of viewing activities (or
MVRs) at each sampling time point. While Figure 8 shows
the total number of viewing activities (or MVRs) that occurs
between two sampling points. Both of these ﬁgures provide
some indications on the size of viewing population.
It is interesting to observe from both ﬁgures that there is
a “daily periodicity” of user behavior. There are two daily
peaks, which occur at around 2:00 P.M. and 11:00 P.M. This
may imply that users tend to subscribe to the P2P-VoD ser-
vice at the end of the lunch break or late in the evening. We
also observe that the viewing population drops at around
8:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M. This may imply that users are usu-
ally on their way to work around this time of the day.
4.3 Health index of Movies
Health index is used to reﬂect the eﬀectiveness of the con-
tent replication strategy of a P2P-VoD system. In this sub-
section, we focus on the health index of the three typical
movies. Measurements were carried out in 24 hours from
00:00, January 6, 2008 to 24:00, January 6, 2008.
Figure 9 illustrates the number of peers that own the
movie. In here, owning a movie implies that the peer is still
in the P2P-VoD system, and that the peer has at least one
chunk of that movie (similar to the movie-level heath index

we discussed in Section 3). We can make two observations
here: (a) Movie 2 being the most popular movie, the num-
ber of users owning the movie is higher than that of movie 1
and 3. (b) The number of users owning the movie is lowest
during the time frame of 05:00 A.M. to 09:00 A.M. As we
mentioned in the previous subsection, this corresponds to
the period that the number of active peers is very low. To
provide QoS-guarantee to users, one may need to allocate
more upload capacity to the server.
The previous measure is a coarse indication of the replica-
tion health of a movie. One may choose a ﬁner indicator to
reﬂect the eﬀectiveness of the replication. In here, we deﬁne
ORi(t) to be the owning ratio of chunk i at time t, or
ORi(t) =
Number of replicas of chunk i at time t
Number of movie owners at time t
.
Again, a movie owner is a peer which possesses at least one
chunk of that movie. If ORi(t) is low, it means low avail-
ability of chunk i in the system. We average ORi(t) over a
24-hour period and Figure 10 illustrates the average owning
ratios for diﬀerent chunks in a 24-hour period. From this
ﬁgure, we observe that the health index for “early” chunks
is very good. This is due to the fact that many peers may
