ABSTRACT
Group signature with message-dependent opening (GS-MDO)
is a kind of group signature in which only the signers who
have created group signatures on problematic messages will
be identi(cid:12)ed.
In the previous GS-MDO scheme, however,
the number of problematic messages is bounded owing to
a limitation of the Groth-Sahai proofs.
In this paper, we
propose the (cid:12)rst GS-MDO scheme with the unbounded-
MDO functionality in the random oracle model. Our un-
bounded GS-MDO scheme is based on the short group signa-
ture scheme proposed by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham and
the Boneh-Franklin identity-based encryption scheme. To
combine these building blocks and to achieve CCA-anonymity,
we also construct a special type of multiple encryption. This
technique yields an eﬃcient construction compared with the
previous bounded GS-MDO scheme: the signature of our
scheme contains about 16 group elements (3630 bits), whereas
that of the previous scheme has about 450 group elements
(75820 bits).

INTRODUCTION
Group signature is a kind of digital signature, proposed
by Chaum and van Heyst [9]. Each signer belongs to a
group and can create a group signature, which can be ver-
i(cid:12)ed whether it was created by a group member, without
identifying the actual signer.
If it is necessary to identify
the signer of a group signature (e.g., a problem that may be
caused by the group signature), only the authority called the
\opener" can identify the corresponding signer of the group
signature. However, since the opener can identify the sign-
ers without any restriction, it seems that the opener’s power
is unfairly strong. For example, there is a possibility that a
non-problematic user will be identi(cid:12)ed.
To decentralize the power of the opener, Sakai et al. pro-
posed a model for group signature with a new capability,
which is called group signature with message-dependent open-
ing (GS-MDO) [15], where a new authority called the \ad-
mitter" is introduced.
If a group signature is found on
a problematic message, the admitter issues a token corre-
sponding to this message, and the opener can identify the
signer of this group signature only when using both the given
token and the opener’s secret key. One of the signi(cid:12)cant
functionalities of GS-MDO is that no interaction between
the opener and the admitter is required.
In other words,
tokens can merely be published by the admitter, and once
the opener receives the token, he is able to open the signa-
tures without any further interaction with any other entity.
Furthermore, once the admitter releases a token for a prob-
lematic message, the opener can open all signatures on that
message.
An application of GS-MDO is an anonymous bulletin board
system, which allows users to post their comments with-
out revealing their own identity.
In the case of disputes,
which may be caused by posting inappropriate comments
(e.g., leaking some personal information of others, a crime
517notice, and so on), GS-MDO comes into eﬀect: the admitter
indicates messages that should be prohibited, and the opener
can identify only the writers who have posted inappropriate
comments on the board. Another application of GS-MDO
is an anonymous auction. To bid anonymously, each bid-
der produces a group signature on his bidding price. After
checking the validity of the group signatures, the admitter
issues a token only to open the signatures on the highest
bid, thereby determining the winner(s). One bene(cid:12)t of this
system (compared with applying the conventional group sig-
nature) is that no loser(s) of this auction can be identi(cid:12)ed
by the opener.
Sakai et al. also presented a generic construction of GS-
MDO from a tag-based key encapsulation mechanism (tag-
based KEM), digital signature, identity-based KEM (IB-
KEM), and non-interactive zero knowledge (NIZK) proof.
Moreover, they gave an instantiation of the generic con-
struction using Shacham’s decision-linear (DLIN) Cramer-
Shoup encryption scheme (actually a tag-based KEM variant
thereof), the Abe-Haralambiev-Ohkubo structure-preserving
signature [2, 1], k-resilient a DLIN variant of the Heng-
Kurosawa IB-KEM [14]), and the Groth-Sahai proof sys-
tem [13], which is used as an instantiation of the NIZK proof
in the standard model.
One of the weaknesses of the speci(cid:12)c construction by Sakai
et al. is that it only achieves \k-bounded" security, in the
sense that the number of tokens the admitter can issue must
be determined when the scheme is set up. This stems from
the (in)compatibility of the known identity-based encryption
(IBE) schemes and the Groth-Sahai proof system. As the
implication result by Sakai et al. suggests, using IBE as a
building block to construct a GS-MDO scheme is indispens-
able. Recall a widely used approach for constructing group
signature, in which each group member is assigned a dig-
ital signature and generate group signature by encrypting
that digital signature and prove the validity of encrypted
signature by using an NIZK proof.
It is also crucial to
use an non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system to en-
sure \well-formedness" of the encrypted certi(cid:12)cate, which
serves as a group signature. Unfortunately, the Groth-Sahai
proof system provides the zero-knowledge property only for
a restricted type of theorem. Basically, when a theorem in-
volves equations between elements of the target group GT ,
the zero-knowledge property is not guaranteed, which is why
the instantiation by Sakai et al. used a k-resilient scheme to
instantiate IB-KEM instead of an ordinary IBE scheme.
Such a k-bounded limitation seems to be unavoidable.
All known IBE schemes (of the discrete-log type) depend
on pairing-type assumptions, and more particularly contain
target-group elements in their ciphertexts. Hence the \well-
formedness" of an IBE ciphertext is described as equations
between target-group elements, for which the Groth-Sahai
proof system does not provide the zero-knowledge property.
Considering the fact that the Groth-Sahai proof system is
currently the only choice for an eﬃcient instantiation of a
zero-knowledge proof system, we have no other way of pro-
viding a proof of this type.
Of course if we want an unbounded GS-MDO scheme, it
is easily possible by applying general NIZK techniques (as in
the BMW/BSZ constructions [4, 5]). However, it might be
hard to achieve an eﬃcient instantiation of the known NIZK
proofs for general NP-languages (The same holds even in the
random oracle model).
From the above considerations, it is diﬃcult to construct
eﬃcient unbounded GS-MDO schemes in the standard model.
Therefore, applying random oracles seems to be a reasonable
solution.
Our Contribution.
In this paper, we propose the (cid:12)rst unbounded GS-MDO
scheme in the random oracle model. The proposed scheme
is based on the Boneh-Boyen-Shacham (BBS) group signa-
ture [7], which is one of the most eﬃcient group signature
schemes in the random oracle model. The opening procedure
is implemented by linear encryption, and a user’s certi(cid:12)cate
is implemented by the Boneh-Boyen short signature [6]. The
functionality of MDO is realized by adopting the Boneh-
Franklin (BF) IBE [8]. In order to combine the short group
signature and the BF IBE, we replace the linear encryption
with a certain type of 2-out-of-2 multiple encryption.
Note that the BBS scheme satis(cid:12)es only CPA-anonymity,
the security game of which does not allow the adversary to
access the opening oracle. We make a further improvement
to the above approach to achieve CCA-anonymity. This im-
provement is carried out by changing the \linear" part of the
multiple encryption to a kind of double encryption similar
to the Naor-Yung construction and adding a validity check
component that ensures \well-formedness" of the ciphertext,
which could be reminiscent of the Cramer-Shoup encryption
scheme [11, 12].
For eﬃciency reasons, to realize the proof, we do not fol-
low the construction of the Cramer-Shoup scheme directly,
but instead use the Fiat-Shamir heuristics. This strategy
yields a more eﬃcient construction compared with that ob-
tained when directly using another DLIN-based CCA-secure
public-key encryption (PKE) is directly used, e.g., Shacham’s
DLIN-variant of the Cramer-Shoup PKE scheme [16].
The proposed scheme simultaneously achieves a higher de-
gree of eﬃciency and security than the previous scheme by
Sakai et al. The signature contains 16 group elements (3630
bits for 80-bit security), whereas that of the previous scheme
contains about 450 elements (about 76000 bits for the same
security level). Furthermore, the proposed scheme allows
the admitter to issue an unbounded number of tokens, which
is not achieved by the previous eﬃcient construction. See
Section 4 for a detailed comparison.
2. PRELIMINARIES
In this section, we present a formal model of the GS-MDO
proposed by Sakai et al. in [15], and computational assump-
tions for our proposed scheme.
2.1 Group Signature with Message-dependent
Opening
GS-MDO is an extension of group signature, which al-
lows members of the group to sign a message anonymously.
In addition, as described in the introduction, there are two
authorities in GS-MDO, the opener and the admitter. The
admitter is able to issue a token that is speci(cid:12)c to a message.
The opener is able to identify the signer of a signature on a
message for which a token from the admitter is available.
A GS-MDO scheme consists of (cid:12)ve probabilistic polynomial-
time algorithms (GKg; GSig; GVf; Td; Open). GKg takes as
inputs (1(cid:21); 1n) where (cid:21) is a security parameter and n is
the number of group members, and outputs (gpk; ok; ak;
518(gski)1(cid:20)i(cid:20)n) where gpk is a group public key, ok is an open-
ing key for the opener, ak is the message speci(cid:12)cation key for
the admitter, and gski is a group signing key for each group
member i. GSig takes as inputs (gpk; i; gski; M ) where M is
a message, and outputs a group signature (cid:27). GVf takes as
inputs (gpk; M; (cid:27)) and outputs ⊤ or ?. Td takes as inputs
(gpk; ak; M ) and outputs the token tM for M . Open takes
as inputs (gpk; ok; M; (cid:27); tM ) and outputs i 2 f1; 2; : : : ; ng or
?.
Note that in the case where the number of tokens issued
by the admitter is bounded by k (like the Sakai et al.’s
scheme [15]), the group key generation algorithm GKg takes
as input (1(cid:21); 1n; 1k).
2.2 The Security Requirements of GS-MDO
Sakai et al. de(cid:12)ned the following three requirements for
a GS-MDO (the de(cid:12)nition of these properties is based on
Bellare, Micciancio, and Warinschi’s security model [4]).
Opener Anonymity.
The opener should be unable to identify the signer of any
group signature without cooperation with the admitter, even
if some group members are corrupted. This requirement is
formalized by the following game. Note that, in order to
model anonymity against the opener, we give the opening
key to the adversary in this game.
Definition 1. We say that a GS-MDO scheme (cid:5) = (GKg;
GSig; GVf; Td; Open) has opener anonymity if for all proba-
bilistic polynomial-time adversaries A, the success probabil-
ity of A in the following game between a challenger is negli-
gible in the security parameter (cid:21).
Setup. The challenger runs GKg(1(cid:21); 1n) and obtain (gpk;
ok; ak; (gski)1(cid:20)i(cid:20)n). Then the challenger sends (gpk;
ok; (gski)1(cid:20)i(cid:20)n) to A.
Token Query I. A is allowed to interact with a token or-
acle. For a token query for M , the challenger runs
Td(gpk; ak; M ) to obtain tM and return tM to A.
Challenge. At some point A requests a challenge for i0; i1 2
. The challenger chooses
). In
which is al-
f1; : : : ; ng and a message M
a random bit b, and return GSig(gpk; gskib ; M
this phase A is forbidden to submit M
ready queried in Token Query I.
