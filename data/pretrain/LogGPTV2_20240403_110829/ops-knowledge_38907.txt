Data encryption: use encryption algorithm to encrypt data, which can protect the security of data in transmission. 5. Authority control: Control the authority of remote users to access the server to prevent illegal access and operation. 6. Security vulnerability scanning and repair: regularly use security vulnerability scanning tools to scan the server, and repair the discovered vulnerabilities in time. 7. Log audit: Use the log audit tool to record all activities on the server, so as to detect and prevent attacks in time. 8. Security strategy and training: formulate a sound security strategy and train employees to enhance security awareness and reduce security risks caused by human factors.
