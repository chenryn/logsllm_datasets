### The Distinction Between Consumers and Customers

The terms "consumer" and "customer" are often used interchangeably, but they do not always refer to the same entity. A customer (also known as a client, buyer, or purchaser) is someone who buys services or goods from another party. In contrast, a consumer is someone who receives a particular service or consumes a product. It is important to note that a customer may or may not also be a consumer. These terms are frequently used interchangeably, but when clarity is essential, this textbook will use the term that best fits the context.

### Service Scenarios

**Figure 1.6.b** illustrates a scenario where a person equipped with belongings (the provider) acts on another person (the customer). A simple example is a hairdressing service, which is representative of a wide variety of services, including beauty, medical, and educational services, all targeted towards human beings.

**Figure 1.6.c** depicts a service targeted at the belongings of a person, such as car repair. Here, the person on the provider's side (mechanic) is equipped with tools, and the customer is not directly involved in the repair process. This situation is typical for cleaning, maintenance, and repair services, as well as any kind of transportation or storage of items (e.g., mail, cargo, parts).

**Example: Customer Involvement**
Today, several food chains, like Subway, emphasize customer involvement by allowing customers to decide the ingredients in their sandwiches. This results in more than 50% customer participation in the service process.

### Additional Service Scenarios

Two other service scenarios will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter of this book:

1. **Self-Service**: This type of service is provided with little or no human involvement on the provider's side. The provider typically sets up facilities or equipment that the customer can use to perform a specific task. Examples include self-service gas stations, ticket vending machines, rental cars, and electronic services. This is illustrated in **Figure 1.6.c**.

2. **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Services**: With recent technological advances, belongings (things) can provide services to other belongings (things). For example, computer programs can request and deliver services to other computer programs. This scenario is depicted in **Figure 1.6.d**.

### Terminology from Communications Technology

In some of the service scenarios described in **Figure 1.6**, terminology from communications technology has been adopted. In this field, different types of communication are described, such as person-to-person (P2P) or human-to-human (H2H), human-to-machine (H2M), and machine-to-machine (M2M). Since communication is considered bi-directional, M2H is typically not distinguished from H2M and is rarely used. This terminology is used to indicate the type of service interaction in different scenarios. Similarly, service interaction is also considered bi-directional (request and response).

- **Figure 1.6.a and 1.6.b** are characterized by person-to-person or human-to-human (H2H) interaction.
- **Figure 1.6.d** is a typical example of human-to-machine (H2M) interaction.
- **Figure 1.6.e** represents machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction.
- **Figure 1.6.c** does not fit neatly into these categories, as the belongings on the customer's side do not interact with the service provider.

In cases where the "machines" are software applications, the terms human-to-application (H2A) and application-to-application (A2A) have been used.

### Operations Management View on Services

In the related disciplines of operations management (OM) and operations research (OR), services have been the subject of research long before the emergence of service science as an autonomous discipline. In German-speaking countries, a sub-discipline of OR, queueing theory, was once called "Bedienungstheorie," which translates to "service theory." Many books on queueing theory and discrete event simulation exemplify service scenarios. The application of OR methods to services will be discussed in Chapter 7 on Service Optimization.

#### Transformation Process

One of the basic concepts in OM is the transformation process. A transformation process involves taking one or more inputs, transforming and adding value to them, and providing outputs for customers or clients. This input-transformation-output model is shown in **Figure 1.7.a**. When the inputs are raw materials, the transformation is relatively straightforward, such as turning milk into cheese and butter. When the inputs are information or people, the nature of the transformation might be less obvious. For example, a hospital transforms ill patients into healthier ones, and a teacher transforms less educated students into well-educated ones.

#### Resources

In operations management, the inputs to the transformation process are called resources. Resources can be persons or things (compare with **Figure 1.6** and Hill [8]). Things are typically categorized into assets and materials. Resources can be both transforming and being transformed. In a typical manufacturing process, the transforming resources are workers together with assets (facilities, machines, and tools) that transform materials (the transformed resources) into finished goods (see **Figure 1.7.b**).

#### Service as a Transformation Process

A service is also a transformation process that can be described using the input-transformation-output model. The key difference compared to manufacturing is that both the provider and the customer give input and participate in the transformation process (compare with Sampsonâ€™s service I/O model [26]).

As illustrated in **Figure 1.5.b**, the input resources can be persons or belongings (goods, things) on both sides (provider and customer). The "change in condition" (Hill) or "transformation" (OM) can take various forms, such as changes in the physical characteristics of resources (repair services, cleaning services, beauty services), changes in the location of resources (transportation services), or changes in the physiological or mental state of people (healthcare services, well-being services, educational services, entertainment services). **Table 1.1** presents examples of service processes with their respective input resources and transformations.

To highlight the unique nature of the service process, a horizontal dotted line divides the transformation box into the supplier's and customer's sides in **Figure 1.8.a and 1.8.b**. Resources do not change ownership during the service process. Both sides participate in the transformation process. Even if the primary target of the condition change is on the customer's side (symbolized by the triangle representing an increase in value), this does not mean that the resources on the supplier's side remain unchanged. The service person may become tired but also more experienced and knowledgeable. Assets may become worn, and materials may be consumed. This close interplay between provider and customer in the service process is referred to as "co-creation of value," a fundamental principle of modern service science (see Chapter 8).

A common misconception is that services are the outputs of service processes, similar to how goods are the outputs of manufacturing processes. From the preceding discussion, it should be clear that a service is not the output of a transformation process; rather, a service is the transformation process itself.

### Resource Intensity of Services

Resources are a fundamental element of services. An important way to characterize services is based on the proportion, or intensity, with which different types of resources or capabilities are used in the service process. The following main types of services have been distinguished according to their resource intensity (they are not mutually exclusive):

- **Labor- and Capital-Intensive Services**
- **Knowledge-Intensive Services**
- **Information-Intensive Services**
- **Technology-Intensive Services**

#### Labor- and Capital-Intensive Services

A labor-intensive service is one in which labor costs outweigh the costs for equipment and materials. A capital-intensive service (also known as an equipment-intensive service) is one in which the capital costs (for facilities, equipment, tools) prevail. For example, a hospital, despite employing many doctors, nurses, administrative staff, and technicians, is a capital-intensive service due to its expensive facilities and equipment (operating rooms, X-ray, tomography, dialysis). Schmenner [27] provides an overview of the capital-labor ratio for different service industries.

#### Knowledge-Intensive Services

Knowledge-intensive services, often referred to as knowledge-intensive business services, rely heavily on professional knowledge.
