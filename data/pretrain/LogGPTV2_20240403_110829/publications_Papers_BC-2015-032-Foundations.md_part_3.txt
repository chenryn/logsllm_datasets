Two other service scenarios will be more extensively discussed in the next

ForsomeoftheservicescenariosdescribedinFigure1.6,aterminologyhas
been used that comes from communications technology. In this field, people
describedifferenttypesofcommunicationsuchasperson-to-personorhuman-to-
human(H2H),human-to-machine(H2M),andmachine-to-machine(M2M).Since
communicationisconsideredbi-directional, M2Histypicallynotdistinguished
fromH2M,andthereforerarelyused. Thisterminologyhasbeenusedtoindicate
the type of service interaction in different service scenarios. Also service inter-
action, like communication, is considered bi-directional (request and response).
Accordingly,theservicescenariosdescribedinFigure1.6.aandbarecharacter-
izedbytheirperson-to-personorhuman-to-human(H2H)interaction(belongings
in Figure 1.6.b are not considered to interact with the customer). Self-service

TransformationProcess
OneofthebasicconceptsofOMisthetransformationprocess[24,25]. Atransfor-
mationprocessisanyactivityorgroupofactivitiesthattakesoneormoreinputs,
transformsandaddsvaluetothem,andprovidesoutputsforcustomersorclients.
Thisso-calledinput-transformation-outputmodelisshowninFigure1.7.a. When
the inputs are raw materials, it is relatively easy to identify the transformation
involved,aswhenmilkistransformedintocheeseandbutterorwhenthousands

Resources
In operations management, the inputs to the transformation process are called
resources. Resources can be persons or things (compare with Figure 1.6 and
Hill[8]). Thingsaretypicallydistinguishedintoassetsandmaterials. Resources
canbetransformingandbeingtransformed[25].Inatypicalmanufacturingprocess,

ServiceasaTransformationProcess
A service is also a transformation process that can be described with the input-
transformation-outputmodel. Thedifferencecomparedtomanufacturingisthat
both provider and customer give input to and participate in the transformation
process(comparewithSampson’sserviceI/Omodel[26]).
As already illustrated in Figure 1.5.b, the input resources can be persons or
belongings(goods,things)onbothsides(providerandcustomer). The“change

of condition” (Hill) or “transformation” (OM) can be of very different nature:
e.g.,changesinthephysicalcharacteristicsofresources(repairservices,cleaning
services, beauty services), changes in the location of resources (transportation
services), or changes in the physiological or mental state of people (healthcare
services,well-beingservices,educationservices,entertainmentservices). Table1.1

this does not mean that the resources on the supplier’s side don’t experience a
change duringthe serviceprocess. Theservice person mightget tiredfrom the
servicedelivery,butalsomoreexperiencedandmoreknowledgeable. Assetsmight
becomeworn,materialsbeconsumed. Forthiscloseinterplaybetweenprovider
andcustomerintheserviceprocess,theterm“co-creationofvalue”wascoined.
Co-creation of value is one of the most important principles of modern service
science(seeChapter8).
Afrequentmisconceptionisthatservicesaretheoutputsofserviceprocesses

notpreciseinthisrespect. Fromtheprecedingdiscussionitshouldhavebecome
clear that a service is not the output of a transformation process, a service is a
transformationprocess.

Labor-andcapital-intensiveServices
Alabor-intensiveserviceisaserviceinwhichthelaborcostsoutweighthecosts
forequipmentandmaterials. Acapital-intensiveservice(alsoequipment-intensive
service) is a service in which the capital costs (for facilities, equipment, tools)
prevail. Ahospital,evenifitemploysmanydoctors,nurses,administrativestaff,
and technicians, is a capital-intensive service due to its expensive facilities and
equipment(operatingrooms,x-ray,tomography,dialysis).Schmenner[27]provides
