### Operation 3: Manipulating the .GOT Entry of `free` (i.e., `addr_free`)

- **Load `addr_free` to memory during program initialization**:
  - The .GOT entry for the `free` function (i.e., `addr_free`) is initially set to point to the original `free` function.
  - During program initialization, the attacker loads a new address (`MCode`) into the .GOT entry for `free`.

- **Change in .GOT entry**:
  - **Before**: `addr_free` points to the original `free` function.
  - **After**: `addr_free` points to `MCode`.

- **Execution of `addr_free`**:
  - When the `free` function is called, it now executes the code at `MCode` instead of the original `free` function.

### Figure 4: NULL HTTPD Heap Overflow Vulnerabilities

- **Source Code, Reading Input**:
  ```c
  1: PostData = calloc(contentLen + 1024, sizeof(char));
  2: pPostData = PostData;
  3: do {
  4:     rc = recv(sock, pPostData, 1024, 0);
  5:     if (rc == -1) {
  6:         closeconnect(sid, 1);
  7:         return;
  8:     }
  9:     pPostData += rc;
  10:    x += rc;
  11: } while ((rc == 1024) || (x < contentLen));
  ```

- **pFSM4**:
  - **Description**: This finite state machine (FSM) illustrates the consequences of corrupting the .GOT entry of the `free` function (i.e., `addr_free`). It is similar to the scenario depicted by `pFSM3` in the Sendmail vulnerability discussed in Section 4.
  - **Outcome**: When `free` is called again, the malicious code (`MCode`) is executed.

### Summary of the Model

- **Model Structure**:
  - The model consists of three operations.
  - **Operation 1**: Includes two activities, each described by an independent FSM (`pFSM1` and `pFSM2`).
  - **Operation 2 and Operation 3**: Each consists of a single FSM.
  - **Cascading pFSMs**: These four FSMs are cascaded to reason through the entire vulnerable code.

### Purpose of the Next Set of Examples

- **Two-Fold Objective**:
  1. **Broad Class of Vulnerabilities**: Show that the FSM approach can analyze a wide range of vulnerabilities, including input validation errors, file race condition errors, stack buffer overflows, and format string vulnerabilities.
  2. **Additional Examples**: Provide more examples of different types of pFSMs that broadly model the studied vulnerabilities.

### Example 2: xterm Log File Race Condition

- **Context**:
  - The program `xterm` emulates a terminal under the X11 window system.
  - A file race condition exists when `xterm` writes messages to the user log file.

- **Figure 5: xterm Log File Race Condition**:
  - **pFSM1**:
    - **Predicate**: If Tom does not have write permission or the provided filename is a symbolic link, the FSM should reach the reject state.
    - **Implementation**: The real implementation follows `pFSM1`, ensuring this check is secure.
  - **pFSM2**:
    - **Problem**: In state A, Tom can delete the file `/usr/tom/x` and create a symbolic link from `/usr/tom/x` to `/etc/passwd` before the system opens the file, leading to a race condition.
    - **Exploit**: Tom can append his own data to the file `/etc/passwd`.

### Example 3: Solaris Rwall Arbitrary File Corruption Vulnerability

- **Context**:
  - `Rwall` is a UNIX network utility that allows a user to send a message to all users on a remote system.
  - The file `/etc/utmp` on a remote system contains a list of all currently logged-in users.

- **Figure 6: Solaris Rwall Arbitrary File Corruption Vulnerability**:
  - **Operation 1**:
    - **Write to `/etc/utmp`**: A regular user can write to `/etc/utmp` and add an entry like `../etc/passwd`.
  - **Operation 2**:
    - **Message Write Operation**: The `Rwall` daemon gets a filename from `/etc/utmp` and writes the message to the specified file.
    - **Predicate**: `pFSM2` states that if the filename refers to a non-terminal file (e.g., `../etc/passwd`), it should be rejected. However, the implementation does not perform this check, leading to a security violation.

### Example 4: Validation Error due to IIS Decoding Filenames Superfluously after Applying Security Checks

- **Context**:
  - CGI programs under the `/wwwroot/scripts` directory are executable through HTTP requests.
  - IIS interprets the filepath as relative to `/wwwroot/scripts`.

- **Figure 7: IIS Decodes Filenames Superfluously after Applying Security Checks**:
  - **pFSM1**:
    - **Predicate**: If the target file does not reside in `/wwwroot/scripts` or the path contains `../`, reject the request.
    - **Implementation**: IIS performs two decoding steps. After the second decoding, a malformed filename (e.g., `..%252f`) becomes `../`, allowing the execution of arbitrary programs outside `/wwwroot/scripts`.

### Common Types of pFSMs

- **Vulnerabilities Modeled**:
  - Buffer overflow, race condition, signed integer, and format string vulnerabilities.
  - Other vulnerabilities such as access validation errors, input validation errors, and failure to handle exceptional conditions can also be modeled using pFSMs.

- **Simplicity of Predicates**:
  - The simplicity of the predicates defining the pFSMs makes it easier to generate and understand the models.
