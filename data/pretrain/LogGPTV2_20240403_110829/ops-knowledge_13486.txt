User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Apache2 setting up Problem with Ubuntu and PHP5 [Solution] Removal of the .htaccess file in /var/www/.

Apache2, php5, Ubuntu- restarted, no firewall, but server not working. The access to http://IP/dir/index.html ignites the "Forbidden" message. Why do I get the error message?

$ sudo service apache2 start

Assistant: Not enough information here really -- what is the config file? what's in the "dir" directory, etc., but it's worth noting that the apache user ("www" in this case, we presume) needs directory read permission on all directories above this one up to the effective root if it is going to be able to find it.
