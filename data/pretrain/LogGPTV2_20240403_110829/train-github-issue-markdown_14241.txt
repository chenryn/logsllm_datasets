On Windows (8) and french keymap, the closing bracket is done with alt-gr +
')' key.
However, pressing alt-gr + ')' to write ']' seems to be mapped to the "fold
function" command instead. So pressing this combination folds the current
function but doesn't write the "]" character.
Noticed it in v0.117 and it is still present in v0.118.
