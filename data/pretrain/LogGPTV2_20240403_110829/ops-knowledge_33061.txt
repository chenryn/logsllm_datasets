User: Hello i want to install these dependencies in OpenShift for my App
yum -y install wget gcc zlib-devel bzip2-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel sqlite-devel readline-devel tk-devel gdbm-devel libffi-devel libxslt libxslt-devel libxml2 libxml2-devel openldap-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel openjpeg-devel libtiff-devel libyaml-devel python-virtualenv git libpng12 libXext xorg-x11-font-utils
But don't know how, is it through rhc? if so, how?
Assistant: You can not use the "yum" command to install packages on OpenShift.  What specific issue are you having? I am sure that at least some of those packages are already installed in OpenShift online already (such as wget).  Have you tried running your project to see what specific errors you get about what is missing?
