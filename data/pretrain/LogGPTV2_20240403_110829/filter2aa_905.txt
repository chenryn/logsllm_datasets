Good Viruses. Evaluating the Risks.
Dr. Igor Muttik | Senior Architect | McAfee | Avert Labs®

Good viruses
• It is just technology – neither bad nor good
• What could make it dangerous:
— Lack of control
— Wide availability
• If it is dangerous – it’s bad
— “Atomic bomb” is bad
— “Splitting the atom”?
— “Chain reaction”? (worst because control is lost)
• Can a virus be written accidentally?
• Can a good virus get out of control?
3
Agenda
• “Good virus” idea keeps coming up
• Already.71 – a tool and a virus
(disassembly and operation)
• “Corrupted blood” epidemic in WoW (video)
• W32/Nachi – worm that exploited and patched a 
vulnerability
• Pros and cons of harnessing replicating code
• Conclusions
4
Google search for “good virus” and “bad virus”
• People are very receptive to “a good virus” idea
• A lot of “bad virus” searches are emotional (“horrible” and 
”awful”)
5
ALREADY.COM – a tool and a worm!
6
ALREADY.COM tool usage
@echo off 
rem Start of AUTOEXEC.BAT file 
rem Opening commands always execute
ALREADY.COM
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 GOTO skip 
rem Things to do once a day go here 
:skip 
rem Following commands always execute
7
Already.71 – just 71 (0x47) bytes
8
Already.71 – get current date (1st block of 3)
9
Already.71 – compare (2nd block of 3)
10
Already.71 – write itself to disk (3rd block)
11
How does Already.71 spread?
Due to “current folder” concept.
12
A tool
13
Empty folder
14
Execution
15
Replicant!
16
What did we learn?
• Probability of a mistake grows when insecure 
programming techniques are used:
— Self-modifying code
— Modifying other programs on disk or in memory
— Using exploits
• Insecure environments are unexpectedly common
17
“Corrupted blood” incident in WoW
18
“Corrupted blood” epidemic (Sep 2005)
• Zul’Gurub
instance 
dungeon
(added in
WoW 1.7
for 60+ lvl
players):
19
“Hakkar the Soulflayer” monster
• Casts a 
powerful 
“Corrupted
blood”
spell
• Infectious!
• Epidemic 
started
20
What went wrong?
• Timeline
— WoW 1.7 went out on 13 Sep 2005
— Epidemics started on several servers on 15 Sep 2005
— Source - Hakkar monster from Zul’Gurub instance dungeon 
• “Corrupted blood” - spell parameters:
— Damage: 200 HP (60+ level players have 4000-5000 HP)
— Duration: 10 sec (every 2 seconds)
— Radius: 100 yards (infectious with 100% probability!)
— By design it should be very limited in time and space…
— But spreads from a player to a player (+ NPCs and pets)
• And could be “conserved” in an un-summoned pet!
— A design oversight (due to environment complexity)
21
Corrupted blood disease in WoW
• Infected
Ironforge
city:
22
Corrupted blood disease (video)
• Corpses in
the city:
23
Dead characters everywhere (skeletons)
• Fortunately,
in WoW death
is “temporary”
• Game was 
effectively 
unplayable for 
many days – a lot 
of upset users
24
Reaction
• Official reaction while preparing a patch:
• Many players excited: ”first proper world event”
• Fix in 1.8 (10 Oct 2005): “Fixed a bug that would allow 
Hakkar's Corrupted Blood ability to target pets.”
• Fix in 1.9.3 (07 Feb 2006): “Corrupted Blood now deals 
direct damage with a following damage over time effect 
and no longer spreads to others in the raid.”
25
What did we learn?
• Replication went out of control (Chernobyl!)
• If it is implemented in a complex environment it is hard to 
predict all possible scenarios
— To some extent Already.71 too
— The Morris worm
— Internet is a lot more complex
26
W32/Nachi – a vulnerability-patching worm.
27
W32/Nachi (aka W32/Welchia)
• W32/MSBlaster (aka LovSan) – 
11 Aug 2003 
• W32/Nachi – released 18 Aug 2003
— Contains code to download and run Microsoft’s 
patch for MS03-026 RpcDcom vulnerability
— Overloaded many networks
— But, to give credit to the author, was time-limited
(removes itself in 2004)
— At the time of its “suicide” ~30,000 IPs had W32/Nachi
28
What did we learn?
• Beneficial worms can and will contain bugs 
• W32/Nachi lacked control in two areas
— Network load
— Did not die as quickly as was expected
• Internet is a very complex environment
29
To be or not to be? Pros and cons.
30
Pro and contra
• Dr. Bontchev’s «Are "Good" Computer
Viruses Still a Bad Idea?» 1994 paper:
— A useful worm can be created but with all the controls in 
place most people would not consider it to be a virus
• Arguments for:
— Compress/encrypt files/disks
— “Maintenance” worm
— Quicker (and forceful) patching
— Remove bad worms
— Better administration through computers’ discovery 
— Support human rights (censorship in China)
31
Patching using replication
• Very quick (Warhol and flash) worms
• Patching needs to outrun worm 
propagation
• If there is a replicating patch – should 
it be released?
• No, because:
— It is technically risky
— In a rush there is unlikely to be enough time for proper QA
— It is legal minefield too
32
Conclusions
• Replicative property is a rather dangerous technology:
— Available to everybody
— Control is hard (WoW, Nachi)
• Can a useful virus be created? Yes.
• Is it dangerous? Yes, and more then we expect.
• Messing with infections or viral properties? 
Not a good idea.
