I frequently encounter `groupby` operations in my work, and I often need to write custom functions to process individual groups. These custom functions, however, tend to execute very slowly.

In search of a more efficient solution, I came across the following resources:
- [Groupby Optimization](http://esantorella.com/2016/06/16/groupby/)
- [GitHub Repository: hdfe/groupby.py](https://github.com/esantorella/hdfe/blob/master/groupby.py)

To use the code from these resources, I had to adapt my function to be compatible with NumPy indexing instead of Pandas indexing. In one test case, this adaptation improved the performance by more than a factor of 100. For a dataset with approximately 5 million rows, the native Pandas implementation did not complete within 2 hours, whereas the adapted version ran in just 35 seconds.

It would be highly beneficial if such optimizations were natively supported by Pandas, eliminating the need for these workarounds.

**Example Use Case:**
- Process data from a source.
- Deduplicate records based on a specific signature.
- Further process the deduplicated records.
- Maintain the deduplicated record, and recalculate it whenever any of the constituent records change.
