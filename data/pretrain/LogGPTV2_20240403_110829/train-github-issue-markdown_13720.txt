**Current behavior**  
Only xlf file are supported
**Expected behavior**  
Having a simple JSON file support
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I generally don't use extract / merge capabilities for i18n and having to
manually right xml in a JS world is painful ^^. I'm use to have my JSON file
with key/translation and go for it :)
Something like `ng2-translate` would be awesome (talking about file
definitions only because the way they do it is very resourceful).
