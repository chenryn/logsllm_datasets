course, the analysis framework we introduced in Section 3 is generic
and can be applied to outages detected by prior systems.
We focus this section on efforts that study residential links and
that use active probes. We omit discussion of prior approaches that
infer outages from BGP activity [31, 34, 35, 61].
Residential measurements Behind-the-NAT residential network
measurements can provide detail about events as well as precise
location information. Such efforts include RIPE Atlas [49, 53], BIS-
Mark [19, 56], and SamKnows [9, 50], as well as host-based software
such as DIMES [2], Dasu [51], and PeerMetric [37]. In contrast, our
goal is breadth and discovering rare weather related outages, par-
ticularly of atypical link types used for rural deployments.
Internet outage detection with active probes Chan et al. [11]
study undersea cable cuts using TCP measurements. Cable cuts are
widely reported outages that visibly affect BGP routes.
PlanetSeer [62] uses passive monitoring of wide-area traffic, not
weather forecasts, to trigger active outside probing of hosts from
PlanetLab nodes. Their results motivate our work: they found that
63% of outages occur within three hops of the edge of the network.
Paxson [45] surveys outages with large scale traceroutes to hosts.
He classifies route outages based on the number of consecutive
failed traceroutes. Consecutive failures can be common for residen-
tial link types (e.g., Satellite), so we use a conservative definition of
a dropout that requires on 11 minutes of no responses, missing a
set of pings from different vantage points across that interval.
Zmap was used to investigate outages in the wake of Hurricane
Sandy [16]. However, their proof of concept weather measurement
is limited to three days of a well-forecast hurricane.
Quan et al. [46] introduce “Trinocular” to analyze ping responses
from a sample of hosts in every /24 (3.4 M) in the IPv4 address
space and have also analyzed the effect of hurricanes [24]. Their
approach considers the aggregated dropouts of a sample of a /24
prefix to represent a meaningful failure. We adopt parameters of
their approach, for example the 11 minute safe probing interval and
use of at least three vantage points. Quan et al. note that studying
individual addresses as we do means that customer-initiated events,
such as turning off the access point, may be interpreted as failures.
However, our approach expects that such address-specific events
are typically independent of weather (and thus controlled for by
§3.2), and if they occur in correlation with weather events, are no
less meaningful individually.
7 CONCLUSIONS
Using an eight-year dataset collected by probing residential IP
addresses in the U.S., we showed that a variety of weather conditions
can inflate the likelihood of Internet dropouts. We quantified this
inflation and show that it varies depending upon the type of weather,
link type, and geographic location. We also showed that the time
to recover from a dropout increases during weather events.
Our datasets and analyses enable a wide range of future studies.
We focused our study on the weather conditions that appeared in a
prior study to have significant impact on residential links [52], but
our datasets span all weather reports. Our data therefore support
myriad other inquiries, such as the combined effects of wind speed
and rain, the effects of cloud cover, and so on. It is also possible
to extend our analysis of recovery times, especially for link types
like cable and satellite, where dynamic address reassignment is
uncommon. For such link types, most recovery times measured by
ThunderPing will be valid (as shown in Table 2), permitting addi-
tional inquiries such as the geographic variation of recovery times
during weather conditions, the relationship between the duration
of a weather condition (such as gale-force winds or a thunder-
storm) and recovery times etc. Our dataset, collected over 8 years
(and counting), allows the analysis of longitudinal trends in drop-
outs across link types, geographic areas, and weather conditions.
Analyses of these trends can answer questions about whether the
deployment of new technologies in an area results in improved
reliability. Further, in this study, we only investigated “dropout”
events, which by definition, only constitute complete packet-loss
from three or more vantage points for at least 11 minutes; how-
ever, a promising avenue of future research is the study of how
shorter events or partial failures are affected by weather. Another
important area of future study is attributing root causes to dropouts
under different weather conditions. Eto et al. [17] observed that
residential U.S. homes experience ∼1.5 power outages annually on
average; we find considerably higher outage rates. While we cannot
precisely compare two such disparate datasets, the large difference
suggests that power outages are not the sole cause of dropouts.
To support researchers, network operators, and policy-makers,
we make our data and code publicly available at: https://thunderping.
