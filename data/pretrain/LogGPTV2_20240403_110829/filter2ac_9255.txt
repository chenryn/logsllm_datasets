Modern mobile operating systems have implemented several security measures to reduce the risk of users installing untrusted certificates and configurations. For example, iOS 10.3 and later versions include an additional step that requires user confirmation before installing new trusted Certificate Authority (CA) certificates and configuration profiles. 

Similarly, on Android, applications targeting compatibility with Android 7.0 (API Level 24) and higher versions default to trusting only the CA certificates that are pre-installed with the operating system. This means that user- or administrator-added CA certificates are not trusted by default, thereby reducing the likelihood of successful adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks.
