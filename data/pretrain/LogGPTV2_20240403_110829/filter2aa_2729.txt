How FIPS 140 Helps (and Hurts) Security
Agenda
● Who Am I?
● Background
● What is FIPS 140?
● How the validation process works
● Look at the Requirements
● Best/Worst of the Requirements
● What does the future hold?
● Closing/Q&A
Who is l0stkn0wledge?
● Work directly with FIPS 140
● Over five years experience
● Seen hundreds of various implementations
● Outside Interests 
● Programmer
● Lock picker
● Security Enthusiast
Why am I Here?
● Want to shine a new light on security standards
● Standards often maligned by people as meaningless
● I suggest they are a good starting point
● Some guidance better than none at all
● Standards don't protect against everything
● Standards become dated take long to maintain
● Enforcement is still on the administrator or end-user
● Can provide a false sense of security
What is FIPS 140?
● Federal Information Processing Standard 140
● Defines requirements for cryptographic systems for 
use in sensitive government systems
● Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP)
● National Institute of Standards and Technology
● Communications Security Establishment of Canada
● Has begun seeing acceptance in other non-
government arenas
Past, Present, and Future of FIPS 140
● Previous revision was FIPS 140-1
● Originally published in 1994
● Items tested under this standard are still valid
● The current standard if FIPS 140-2
● Originally published in 2001
● The future is with FIPS 140-3
● Currently in draft form, publishing date unknown
● Drafting of the standard began in 2005
How Does the Process Work?
● Validations are handled by three parties
● Product vendors
● Accredited Labs (Over 15 labs exist)
● CMVP (both NIST and CSEC)
● Number of labs leads to variance in the testing 
process
● Government reviews lab reports and issues 
certificates
Diving into the Requirements
● Three key components to FIPS 140-2
● FIPS 140-2 Standard
● FIPS 140-2 Derived Test Requirements (DTR)
● FIPS 140-2 Implementation Guidance (IG)
● Requirements are divided into eleven sections
● Four increasing levels of security defined
● All documents are available from NIST
● http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/standards.html
FIPS 140-2 Standard
● The core of FIPS 140
● Original document from which the other two are 
derived
● Defines the requirements of the standard and the 
terminology used
● The document can sometimes be vague and open to 
interpretation
Derived Test Requirements
● Much longer document that details required 
information
● Organized into Assertions (AS)
● Direct statements taken from the standard
● Each AS may contain:
● Vendor Evidence (VEs)
● Documentation and implementation required from 
vendors
● Tester Evidence (TEs)
● Requirements of documentation review and testing for 
the labs
Implementation Guidance
● Smallest of the documents
● Intended to provide clarification of other documents
● Supposedly cannot introduce new requirements
● This doesn't really hold true
● Ties back to both the Standard and the Derived Test 
Requirements

Cryptographic Module Specification
● Defines the approved behavior of the validated 
module
● At Level 1 and 2, the behavior is enforced by user 
configuration.
● Potential for errors to be injected in the method
● Policies can be inconsistent and vague
● At Level 3 and 4, the behavior is enforced through 
configuration.
● Stronger restriction but can be limiting to users
Cryptographic Module Ports and Interfaces
● Views the module as a black box
● Defines requirements for types of data flow
● At Level 1 and 2, no physical or logical separation 
of critical data
● At Level 3 and 4, physical or logical separation of 
critical data entry/output.  Plaintext keys entered via 
“trusted path” or directly attached cable.
Roles, Services and Authentication
● The name says it all
● At Level 1, no authentication
● At Level 2, role-based authentication
● No accountability
● Password lengths can be enforced through policy
● At Level 3 and 4, identity-based authentication
● Users are uniquely identified and credentialed
● Password requirements are system enforced
Password Requirements
● Fall well short of required security
● 1 in 1,000,000 chance of success
● Met by a simple 4-character alphanumeric password
● No restriction on types of passwords
● 1 in 100,000 chance of multiple successes
● Typically enforced via lockout
● Ignores long-term attacks, requirement based on one 
minute
● The future might be brighter (more to come)
Physical Security
● Not applicable to software modules
● Requirements divided by module embodiment
● Single chip, multi-chip standalone, multi-chip 
embedded
● No physical security at Level 1
● At Level 2, opacity and tamper evidence
● At Level 3, tamper response
● At Level 4, tamper detection
What is Opacity?
● Subjective requirement on visibility of system 
internals
● Ventilation can be tricky for many networking 
modules
● The interpretation has changed over time
● Previously seeing make/manufacture of components 
was required
● Now it seems even profile and outline of components 
is sufficient visibility
Opacity Examples
Tamper Evidence and Response
● At Level 2, it must be apparent an attacker 
compromised the module
● Limited testing makes this a weak requirement
● Labs cannot “add new materials”
● At  Level 3, the module must respond to tamper if 
doors/covers removed
● Stronger requirement for modules with doors/covers
● Requires keys to be zeroized and includes 
requirements for powerless zeroization
Operational Environment
● At Level 1, “single-user mode”
● Definition has changed over time
● Original definition is unrealistic
● At Level 2+, the requirement for CC validated 
operating systems
● Greatly limits the platforms that can be supported
● Questionable improvement of security over Level 1
Cryptographic Key Management
● Random Number Generation
● Key Generation
● Key Establishment
● Key Entry/Output
● Only requirements that varies across levels
● Key Storage
● Requirements are mostly meaningless
● Key Zeroization
Random Number and Key Generation
● Requirements for approved RNGs
● Only deterministic RNGs are listed as approved
● Symmetric key generation just makes use of 
approved RNGs
● Asymmetric key generation must follow approved 
methods
● Methods are described in FIPS 140-2 Annex A
● Currently includes FIPS 186-2/3 and ANSI X9.31
Key Establishment and Entry/Output
● Requirements vary by distribution method
● Manual Distribution
● Largely impractical but relatively secure methods
● Secure Carrier, Key loader, tokens, etc.
● Electronic Distribution
● Keys over unsecured media (LAN, WAN, etc.)
● TLS, SSH, Diffie-Hellman
● Manual distribution can be plaintext at low levels
● Electronic distribution is always encrypted
Key Storage and Zeroization
● No requirement for the form of stored keys
● Other requirements for storage are vague at best
● “Association” of key and “entity”
● Key zeroization is simply overwriting of keys
● Using 0's, 1's or random data
● This service needs to exist for all plaintext keys
● Can be performed procedurally, doesn't need to be 
automatic (except for tamper at Level 3/4)
Self-Tests
● Power-up Self-Tests
● Health checks of the approved algorithms
● Integrity tests for firmware/software
● Conditional self-tests
● Performed on certain operations
● Continuous RNG Test
● Pairwise consistency test
● Firmware load test
● Bypass Test
● Manual Key Entry Test
Best and Worst of the Requirements
Best
1.Enforcing stronger 
algorithms
2.Physical security at 
higher levels
3.Bypass tests
Worst
1.Limitations on physical 
security testing
2.Limited zeroization 
requirement
3.Hardware centric
4.No key storage 
protection required.
5.Ignorant of side-channel 
attacks
The Future is Yet to Come
● New revision of the standard is being drafted
● FIPS 140-3, over 7 years in development
● New requirements when (if) available:
● Authentication enforced by module, no more end-
user control over password length, format, etc.
● Side-channel testing requirements at higher levels, at 
a minimum for single-chip modules
● Improved zeroization requirements, limitations of 
procedural zeroization
The Future is ???
● Unclear, the timeline has been changed before
● Best guesses are 2012/2013
● New requirements analysis is purely speculative
● Current public draft is dated
● Newer NIST internal drafts likely have some changes
● Improvement over FIPS 140-2, still not perfect
Summary
● FIPS 140-2 provides some good requirements that 
can improved upon baseline security
● While it is a good first step, it doesn't guarantee you 
are any safer
● Recommend incorporating some of the good into 
projects
