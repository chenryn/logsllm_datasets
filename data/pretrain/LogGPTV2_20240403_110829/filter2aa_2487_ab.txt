the other clergy in the hotel room with Edgar Mitchell and Allen 
Hynek. They did not question that UFOs exist. They discussed only, were 
they from other places? other times? other dimensions? not, was the 
phenomena real – they KNEW that it was – but what was it? and why was it 
managed as it was? 
The suggestion that is was managed as it was and is for good reasons:

The phenomena was mediated always through media (duh). So ... let’s talk 
about media coverage - newspaper coverage in the beginning and how it 
changed in the 1950s. 
Look Magazine “Hunt for the Flying Saucers”  July 1 1952 – three weeks 
before the Washington flap that precipitated a crisis 
“Saucer evades jet, pilot reveals” – headline of The Washington Post 
Typical articles in the NY Times, Washington Post. The article in Life 
Magazine, the extraterrestrial hypothesis.    
What about disreputable media like ... the National Inquirer? 
Generoso (Gene) Pope  - the founder - was in CIA doing psy ops in 
1952 
the newspaper did not make money until the 1960s. Where did the 
large amount of money come from to sustain it? Through Frank Costello, the 
same Mafia family that was used in a few later to plot to assassinate Castro. 
The Missing Times cases - turning everything into anomalies so they 
don’t connect. Like every political assassination in the United States is by a 
“lone gunman.” There is “no conspiracy.”  The CIA told Congress even 
Lincoln was not a conspiracy, despite efforts to kill others at the same time. 
The JFK solution was announced within a few hours. It is a cover story – 
that does not say what the real story is, only that the cover story is not the 
real story.  
UFO stories never made much money for the NI but were carried 
frequently. Celebrity stories, others, made more money.  
John Kenneth Galbraith, Ambassador to India, became incensed at a 
periodical like the NI because of the trash it published. He investigated. It 
was a CIA operation.

what is the subject of The Missing Times? 
a friend in 1975 told Hansen that UFOs were appearing over ICBM silos 
near Great Falls Montana. Many accounts appeared in the local press. Some 
were also in official USAF records, hidden until FOIA requests made them 
public. 
Much regional coverage: no national coverage. Over 130 reports of 
sightings in Montana in late 1975.

UFO sightings at ICBM sites and nuclear Weapons Storage 
Areas  
By Robert L. Hastings  
Although the vast majority of Americans are completely unaware of its existence, the 
UFO/Nukes Connection is now remarkably well-documented. Air Force, FBI, and CIA 
files declassified via the Freedom of Information Act establish a convincing, ongoing 
pattern of UFO activity at U.S. nuclear weapons sites extending back to December 
1948.   
For more than 30 years, I have been interviewing former and retired U.S. Air Force 
personnel regarding their direct or indirect involvement in nuclear weapons-related 
UFO sighting incidents. These individuals—from retired colonels to former airmen—
report extraordinary encounters which have obvious national security implications. In 
fact, taken to their logical conclusion, the reported incidents have planetary 
implications, given the horrific consequences that would result from a full-scale, 
global nuclear war.   
At the time of their experiences, my former/retired USAF sources held positions 
ranging from nuclear missile launch and targeting officers, to missile maintenance 
personnel, to missile security police. The incidents described occurred at Malmstrom, 
Minot, F.E. Warren, Ellsworth, Vandenberg, and Walker AFBs, between 1963 and 
1996. Other sources were stationed at Wurtsmith and Loring AFBs, where B-52 
nuclear bombers were based during the Cold War era 
Herb Strentz, Prof of Journalism, in 1970 survey of UFO press

years 1947-1966.  – also he was on staff for the Condon Committee, I

Allen Dulles was director in 1953 
Lt Genl James Doolittle said in 1954: “There are no rules in such a 
game ...hitherto acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply.” This was 
something NEW for the USA. While criteria for war crimes were invented 
for the trials at Nuremberg, Operation Paperclip was well underway. Truman 
ordered it shut down but it continued covertly into the 1970s. The President 
is not always in the loop. (Is that a conspiracy theory? No. It is a fact.)  
By 1953 the CIA was six times larger than in 1947. 
By 1952 ¾ of the CIA budget went to clandestine collection and 
covert operations, e.g. Operation Ajax ousted Iran’s Mohammad Massadegh. 
Operation Success in 1954 ousted Guatemala’s Jacobo Arbenz Guzman 
(Eisenhower hired Eddie Bernays to manage the public “spin” of Operation 
Success, applying public relations to covert operations).

Dorothy Kilgallen – d. 1955 
Dorothy Kilgallen was the most famous syndicated woman journalist of her 
day. Stationed in England in 1954 - 55, and privy to the highest levels of 
English society and its secrets, she wired two unusual dispatches which may 
have contributed to her death. The first, sent in February 1954, mentioned a 
"special hush-hush meeting of the world's military heads" scheduled to take 
place the following summer. The 1955 dispatch, which barely preceded her 
death from an alleged overdose of sleeping pills and alcohol quoted an 
unnamed British official of cabinet rank, `We believe, on the basis of our 
inquiry thus far, that saucers were staffed by small men-probably under four 
feet tall. It's frightening, but there is no denying the flying saucers come 
from another planet.'  
Whatever the source (rumored to be the Earl of Mountbatten), this kind of 
leak in the atmosphere of the mid- 50s was an unacceptable leak. It is well to 
recall that the secret CIA-orchestrated Robertson Panel had met in 1953 and 
issued the Robertson Report. Briefly summarized, this document-and the 
attitudes reflected there - represented a new hard-line attitude to covering up 
all significant UFO phenomena. 
[IN FEBRUARY 1996, an independent task force of the Council on 
Foreign Relations led by Richard Haass, a former senior director for Near 
East and South Asian Affairs of the National Security Council in the Bush 
administration, proposed taking a "fresh look…at limits on the use of non-
official 'covers' for hiding and protecting those involved in clandestine 
activities." Haass later publicly expanded on this point, challenging what he 
characterized as the prohibition on the use of journalists as undercover 
intelligence agents. The outcry among journalists-including many who are 
members of the Council of Foreign Relations-led council president Leslie 
Gelb to distance himself and the council from the task force and its 
recommendations.  
The reaction to the controversy among U.S. intelligence professionals, 
however, was quite different-and far more disturbing to journalists. John 
Deutch, director of Central Intelligence, appeared before Congress and said 
there was no need to change U.S. policy as Haass had advocated, since the 
CIA already had the power to use U.S. reporters as spies. Under the terms of 
the guidelines adopted after the Church Commission report, the CIA director 
retained the right to approve such recruitment if he judged it necessary, 
Deutch explained. Deutch received public support for his interpretation of 
the CIA's prerogative from Stansfield Turner, the CIA chief in the Carter 
administration. Speaking to a gathering of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors, Turner revealed that he had authorized the use of 
journalists in intelligence operations three times during his tenure as CIA 
director.]

What was happening in the 1940s and 1950s with UFOs? 
December 1952 H. Marshall Chadwell, asst. director of scientific 
intelligence at the CIA, sent a memo to the Director about the UFO 
situation: “Reports of incidents convince us that there is something going us 
that must have immediate attention ... sightings of unexplained objects at 
great altitudes and traveling at high speeds in the vicinity of major US. 
defense installations are of such nature that they are not attributable to 
natural phenomena or known types of aerial vehicles.” 
Ruppelt, 1956, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects: “UFOs were 
seen more frequently around areas vital to the defense of the United States,” 
such as White Sands, Oak Ridge, SAC bases, Los Alamos-Albuquerque, etc. 
– see article in Look Magazine 1952.  
Project Sign was instigated following a recommendation from Lt. General 
Nathan Twining then head of Air Materiel Command Just before this, Brig. 
Gen. George Schulgen, of the Army Air Force air intelligence division, had 
completed a preliminary review of the many UFO reports--then called 
"flying discs" by military authorities--which had received considerable 
publicity following the Arnold sighting of June 24, 1947. Schulgen's study, 
completed in late July 1947, concluded that the flying discs were real craft. 
Schulgen then asked Twining and his command, which included the 
intelligence and engineering divisions located at Wright Field), to carry out a 
more exhaustive review of the data. 
In his formal letter to Schulgen Twining wrote:  
• a. The phenomenon reported is something real and not visionary 
or fictitious. 
• b. There are objects probably approximately the shape of a disc, 
of such appreciable size as to appear to be as large as a man-made 
aircraft. 
• c. There is the possibility that some of the incidents may be caused by 
natural phenomena, such as meteors. 
• d. The reported operating characteristics such as extreme rates of 
climb, maneuverability (particularly in roll), and action which 
must be considered evasive when sighted or contacted by friendly 
aircraft and radar, lend belief to the possibility that some of the 
objects are controlled either manually, automatically or remotely. 
• e. The apparent common description of the objects is as follows: ... 
• f. It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge... to construct a 
piloted aircraft which has the general description ... 
• g. Any development in this country along the lines indicated would be 
extremely expensive... 
• h. Due consideration must be given to the following: 
(1) The possibility that these objects are of domestic origin - the 
product of some high security project not known to AC/AS-2 or this 
command. 
(2) The lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered 
exhibits which would undeniably prove the existence of these objects. 
(3) The possibility that some foreign nation has a form of propulsion, 
possibly nuclear, which is outside of our domestic knowledge. 
Project Sign was established in late 1947, charged with investigating 
“flying saucer” reports. In line with orders from high-ranking U.S.A.F 
officers, Sign’s personnel operated on the principle that the subject should 
be taken seriously, on the grounds that UFOs may represent genuine aircraft 
whose origins are mysterious and possibly threatening to US security. 
Though Sign earlier investigated earlier UFO reports, Historian David 
Jacobs writes that the Chiles-Whitted UFO Encounter of July 24, 1948 “had 
a great impact at Sign” (Jacobs, 47). In that encounter, two experienced 
airline pilots claimed a torpedo-shaped object nearly collided with their 
commercial airplane. Sign personnel judged the report convincing and 
compelling, partly because the alleged object also closely matched the 
description of an independent sighting from The Hague a few days earlier. 
According to Michael Swords, Sign personnel “intensely investigated” the 
Chiles-Whitted for several months. Despite the lack of physical evidence, 
some Sign personnel judged this and other UFO reports quite persuasive, 
and concluded that UFOs could have only a non-earthly source. Swords 
writes, 
“The project members reasoned that they had several dozen aerial 
observations that they could not explain, many of them by military 
pilots and scientists. The objects seemed to act like real technology, 
but their sources said they were not ours.  
Given that there was no evidence that either the Americans or Soviets had 
anything remotely like the UFOs reported, Sign personnel gradually began 
considering extraterrestrial origins for the objects. 
Swords argues that this consideration of non-earthly origin was “not as 
incredible in intelligence circles as one might think.” Because many in the 
military were “pilots, engineers and technical people” they had a “’can do’ 
attitude” and tended to regard unavailable technologies not as 
impossibilities, but as challenges to be overcome. Rather than dismissing 
UFO reports out of hand, they considered how such objects might function. 
This perspective, argues Swords, “contrasted markedly with many scientists 
characterizations of such concepts as impossible, unthinkable or absurd.” 
(Swords, p93) 
According to Swords, the “Estimate of the Situation” was probably 
completed in September 1948. The Estimate also argued that UFO reports 
might closely coincide with the approach of the planets Mercury, Venus or
