Abstract—Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) and Link Manager
Protocol
(LMP) authentication are two main authentication
mechanisms in Bluetooth speciﬁcation. In this paper, we present
two novel attacks, called link key extraction and page blocking
attacks, breaking LMP authentication and SSP authentication,
respectively. Link key extraction attack allows attackers to
extract link keys of Bluetooth devices generated during the SSP
procedure by exploiting Bluetooth HCI dump. Page blocking
attacks by man-in-the-middle (MITM) attackers enforce Blue-
tooth connections, enabling subsequent SSP downgrade attacks to
bypass the SSP authentication challenge. In order to demonstrate
the efﬁcacy, we implement our attacks on various real-world
devices and show that (1) a target link key is dumped into a
log and extracted efﬁciently, possibly leading to the subsequent
impersonation attack, and (2) malicious MITM connections can
be established with 100% success rate, enabling subsequent
SSP downgrade attack. We investigate the root causes for the
vulnerabilities and present mitigations.
I. INTRODUCTION
Authentication mechanisms of Bluetooth, such as pairing
and Link Manager Protocol (LMP) authentication, are the
ﬁrst-line defense for billions of users to protect
their de-
vices from unauthorized pairing attempts. To authenticate
a newly connected device, the pairing process generates a
shared secret, called a link key. The link key is the only
hidden value of security parameters for LMP authentication
and encryption key generation. For the quick resumption of
future sessions, the link key can be saved after the initial
pairing and reused, omitting the later pairing procedures. LMP
authentication enables the paired devices to authenticate each
other by challenging whether they possess the same link key.
In order to improve the pairing experiences and security, the
Bluetooth standard introduced Secure Simple Pairing (SSP)
since Bluetooth v2.1. Speciﬁcally, SSP has the following four
authentication mechanisms with different security levels: (1)
Just Works, (2) Numeric Comparison, (3) Out of Band, and
(4) Passkey Entry. Furthermore, SSP—except Just Works—
provides resilience against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
by taking advantage of public-key cryptography.
Despite the authentication mechanisms, with its growing
popularity, Bluetooth has inevitably emerged as a major attack
surface; the speciﬁcation ﬂaws of SSP [1]–[6] and the imple-
mentation ﬂaws in Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux made
by each vendor [7]–[10] have been exploited. BIAS [7] pre-
sented how to perform impersonation attacks by breaking the
LMP authentication. KNOB [8] presented an attack method on
the subsequent encryption key negotiation protocol by manip-
ulating the Bluetooth ﬁrmware layer. In addition, downgrading
SSP has been discussed in several previous studies. The attack
methods posed a question “what security guarantees do the
Bluetooth authentication mechanisms actually provide?”.
