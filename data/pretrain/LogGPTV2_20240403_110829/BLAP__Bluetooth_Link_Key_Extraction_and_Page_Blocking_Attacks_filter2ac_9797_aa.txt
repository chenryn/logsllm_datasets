**Abstract:**
Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) and Link Manager Protocol (LMP) authentication are the two primary authentication mechanisms in the Bluetooth specification. This paper introduces two novel attacks: link key extraction and page blocking attacks, which compromise LMP and SSP authentication, respectively. The link key extraction attack allows attackers to extract link keys generated during the SSP procedure by exploiting Bluetooth HCI dumps. The page blocking attack, executed by a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker, forces Bluetooth connections, enabling subsequent SSP downgrade attacks to bypass the SSP authentication challenge. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, we implemented them on various real-world devices. Our results show that (1) target link keys can be efficiently dumped and extracted, potentially leading to impersonation attacks, and (2) malicious MITM connections can be established with a 100% success rate, facilitating subsequent SSP downgrade attacks. We also investigate the root causes of these vulnerabilities and propose mitigations.

## I. Introduction

Bluetooth authentication mechanisms, such as pairing and Link Manager Protocol (LMP) authentication, serve as the first line of defense for billions of users, protecting their devices from unauthorized pairing attempts. During the pairing process, a shared secret, known as a link key, is generated. This link key is a critical security parameter used for LMP authentication and encryption key generation. For future sessions, the link key can be saved and reused, bypassing the need for repeated pairing procedures. LMP authentication ensures that paired devices can authenticate each other by verifying they possess the same link key.

To enhance pairing experiences and security, the Bluetooth standard introduced Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) in Bluetooth v2.1. SSP includes four authentication mechanisms with varying security levels: (1) Just Works, (2) Numeric Comparison, (3) Out of Band, and (4) Passkey Entry. Except for Just Works, SSP provides resilience against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by leveraging public-key cryptography.

Despite these authentication mechanisms, Bluetooth has become a significant attack surface due to its widespread use. Specification flaws in SSP [1]–[6] and implementation flaws in Android, iOS, Windows, and Linux [7]–[10] have been exploited. BIAS [7] demonstrated how to perform impersonation attacks by breaking LMP authentication. KNOB [8] presented an attack method on the subsequent encryption key negotiation protocol by manipulating the Bluetooth firmware layer. Additionally, downgrading SSP has been discussed in several studies. These attack methods raise the question: "What security guarantees do the Bluetooth authentication mechanisms actually provide?"
