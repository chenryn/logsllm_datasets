While attempting to use Apache Superset, I successfully established a connection to the database. However, when I tried to execute an SQL query, I encountered the following error:

```
(1045, "Access denied for user 'ETL_DEV'@'bbox.lan' (using password: YES)")
(Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)
```

I believe this is an access-related issue. Could you please provide information on the necessary permissions required for the user, or suggest how to resolve this problem?
