### Does One Size Fit All?

#### 5.1. The Administration of Joseph Momoh

The political landscape during the succession of Joseph Momoh has been extensively analyzed elsewhere (Sesay, 1999a). It is sufficient to note that his tenure marked a nadir in the country's fortunes, further marginalizing an already disenfranchised populace. Although Momoh called for a "New Order" upon assuming office, he lacked the legitimacy, vision, and political will to break from the past. Corruption, economic mismanagement, political ineptitude, favoritism, and sycophancy reached such levels that Sierra Leone was effectively reduced to a banana republic. The economy and social infrastructure, including health, education, and transportation, collapsed. The government, unable to generate revenue even from its primary source, diamonds, became heavily dependent on external financial support from traditional allies like Britain and international agencies such as the UN.

Much of the aid provided by the donor community was also misappropriated by government officials and their associates. Under Momoh, the survival instinct of the average Sierra Leonean was stretched to the breaking point. Perhaps his most egregious oversight was his neglect of the civil war, which began in March 1991 with sporadic rebel attacks in the southeastern parts of the country by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led by disgraced army corporal Foday Sankoh, with assistance from Charles Taylor in Liberia.

#### 5.2. Civil War and the End of Innocence

The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s signaled the end of the Cold War, a period of intense ideological rivalry between the East and West, supported by powerful military alliances. Ironically, while the end of the Cold War led to the withdrawal of great powers from Africa, it also precipitated the collapse of central authorities in many African states that had been bankrolled and "protected" by Washington and Moscow. West Africa, particularly, experienced concurrent bloody civil wars in Liberia (1989–1997 and 2000–2003) and Sierra Leone (1991–2000).

The war in Sierra Leone, often referred to as an "uncivil war" (Ukeje, 2003), was one of the most savage in postcolonial West African history. Over 10,000 child soldiers were involved, and more than 400,000 refugees were displaced, living in harsh conditions in neighboring countries. The RUF, notorious for its brutal tactics, including the amputation of limbs, inflicted widespread and systematic sexual violence against women and girls, including rape, sexual assault, and sexual slavery (Human Rights Watch, 2002).

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) documented these atrocities, which formed the basis for the Special Court set up to try those bearing the greatest responsibility for the war crimes. The brutality of the conflict caught the attention of the international community, particularly the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which made valiant efforts to bring the war to an end. The Lomé Agreement of July 1999 between the Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF established a TRC to promote national reconciliation.

#### 6. TRCs and Post-Conflict Reconciliation: A Synoptic Review of the Literature

The literature on Truth Commissions is still developing, reflecting the lack of universal agreement on what constitutes "truth" and "reconciliation," especially in post-conflict contexts. This essay aims to highlight key issues in post-conflict reconciliation, particularly in the context of Sierra Leone since 2002.

According to Ilan Lax, a former member of the South African TRC, "reconciliation is a journey, not an event." TRCs, like those in South Africa and Sierra Leone, do not provide quick fixes but serve as guides on the long road to national settlement and peacebuilding. The transition from war to peace and national reconciliation is expected to be long and arduous but necessary for stability and sustainable peace.

The Sierra Leone TRC was mandated to create an impartial historical record of human rights violations, address impunity, respond to the needs of victims, and promote healing and reconciliation. Official statements indicated high expectations for the TRC, including the hope that it would heal the wounds of the nation and provide a channel for perpetrators to expiate their guilt.

However, the TRC faced several challenges, including the inability to cope with the overwhelming number of requests for material benefits, a focus on public truth-telling at the expense of reparations, and a lack of partnership with local institutions. The role of the international community was also crucial, but extreme care must be taken to avoid falling short of popular expectations or reducing support to periodic visits and troubleshooting.

Björn Petersson (2005) emphasized the need to understand the character of recent violent internal conflicts before designing reconciliation packages. Sustainable reconciliation should be context-specific, home-grown, and long-term, involving elements such as truth, justice, and reparations. In Sierra Leone, the public discourse focused more on individual forgiveness than on justice and reparations, which are critical for the success of such exercises.

Chris Dolan (2005) examined the case of East Timor, another small country with a complex colonial and post-colonial history, and highlighted the limitations of focusing narrowly on particular elements of a larger legacy of injustice. Chandra Sriram (2001) challenged the simplistic treatment of the peace/justice trade-off in transitional justice literature, arguing for a more nuanced set of choices. She identified three factors that influence accountability: the international political and historical contexts, the history of past abuses, and the nature of civilian-military relations.

In conclusion, the effectiveness of TRCs in post-conflict reconciliation depends on a range of factors, including the context-specific nature of the process, the involvement of local and international actors, and the balance between justice and reparation. The lessons learned from Sierra Leone and other post-conflict situations underscore the importance of a holistic and inclusive approach to reconciliation.
