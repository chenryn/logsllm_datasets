tion, and most especially the idle youth. The politics of Momoh’s succession has 
been treated exhaustively elsewhere (Sesay 1999a). Suffice it to say that his tenure 
capped the misfortunes of the country and its already emasculated and marginal-
ized citizenry. Although the new president had called for a “New Order” soon after 
he assumed office, he lacked the legitimacy, vision and political will to make a clean 
break with the past. Corruption, economic mismanagement, political ineptitude, 
favoritism and sycophancy assumed such a magnitude that the country was more 
or less turned into the proverbial banana republic. The economy collapsed totally as 
did social infrastructure like health, education, transport etc. As government failed 
to raise revenue even from the main source, diamonds, it became highly dependent 
on external financial support from traditional allies like Britain, and international 
agencies such as the UN, for its budgetary needs. Of course, even much of what was 
provided by the donor community was equally misappropriated by those in govern-
ment and their cronies. In other words, under the administration of Joseph Mo-
moh, the burden as well as survival instinct of the ordinary Sierra Leonean became 
overstretched.1 Perhaps Momoh’s mortal sin was his neglect of the civil war which 
started in March 1991 with sporadic rebel attacks in the south eastern parts of the 
country by the Revolutionary United Front, RUF, led by a disgraced army corporal 
Foday Sankoh, with help from Charles Taylor across the border in Liberia.
Although ostensibly a protest against the shabby way Momoh was prosecuting 
the rebel war, the coup by Captain Valentine Strasser did not bring the war to an 
end. In fact, with time, Strasser too became politically ambitious and was unwilling 
to hand over power to civilians, contrary to an earlier promise.2 A palace coup led 
by his second in command, Steven Maada Bio, ousted him in 1996. Bio promised 
to return the country to civil rule as soon as possible and subsequently organized 
elections three months later, in March 1996, which brought to power Tejan Kab-
bah, a former bureaucrat with the UN system, who pledged to bring the civil war 
to an end.
5.2. civil war, and good-bye to innocence  
The collapse of communism in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s 
signalled  the  end  of  one  of  the  most  important  eras  in  history,  the  Cold  War,  a 
1. The author was confronted with this reality while on holiday in Sierra Leone in 1989. A close rela-
tion needed medical attention and I took her to Connaught Hospital, Freetown, then the main 
hospital in the country. There were no facilities available. I had to bring along pillow cases, bed 
covers, and a bucket to fetch water. The screens dividing beds had all disappeared so there was no 
privacy for patients. Moreover, I not only purchased the drugs outside the hospital of course, but I 
had to pay a doctor and a nurse working in the hospital to administer the drugs and make sure that 
the patient took them as and when necessary, according to the doctor’s prescription. While visiting 
my relative, a young lady of 21 suffering from tetanus was brought in half naked, and deposited on 
the bed next to that of my patient. Without relations to foot the medical bills, she had no attention 
and died less than twelve hours later. Such was the dilapidated state of the health sector and facili-
ties in the country.

euphemism for the most intense ideological rivalry between the east and west, and 
backed by the world’s greatest military alliance systems that were also armed to the 
teeth. Ironically, while the end of the Cold War led to the withdrawal of the great 
powers from Africa, it also triggered the collapse of central authorities in many Af-
rican states that were once bankrolled and “protected” by Washington and Moscow. 
The sub-region that was perhaps the most affected was West Africa, which expe-
rienced concurrent bloody civil wars in Liberia, 1989–1997, and then 2000–2003, 
and Sierra Leone, 1991 to 2000. 
It is now widely acknowledged that the war in Sierra Leone was anything else 
but civil. The “uncivil war” as Charles Ukeje, prefers to call it1 was the most sav-
age in the history of postcolonial West Africa as the sub-region became one of the 
most volatile in Africa. It has been estimated that over 10,000 child soldiers were 
involved in the war. The Sierra Leone civil war generated over 400,000 refugees, 
most of whom lived in very harsh and inhuman conditions in neighbouring coun-
tries.2 The “network” wars in Sierra Leone and neighbouring Liberia destabilized 
the sub-region for over a decade spilling over to Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea Bissau and 
Guinea Conakry. 
The Revolutionary United Front, RUF, was particularly notorious for its crude 
and indiscriminate amputation of limbs, a phenomenon that was to give different 
meanings to popular English phrases such as “short sleeve” and “long sleeve”. In the 
idiom of the RUF, “short sleeve” meant crude amputation of either or both hands 
from the elbow, while “long sleeve” was cutting off the hand from the wrist. There 
was 
…widespread and systematic sexual violence against women and girls including in-
dividual and gang rape, sexual assault with objects such as firewood, umbrellas and 
sticks, and sexual slavery (Human Rights Watch, www.hrw.org/backgrounder/af-
rica/sl.bck0226.htm).
And according to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Final Report,
As the conflict exploded into appalling brutality against civilians, the world recoiled 
in horror at the tactics used by the RUF, its allies and opponents. Reports emerged 
of indiscriminate amputations, abductions of women and children, recruitment of 
children as combatants, rape, sexual slavery, cannibalism, gratuitous killings and 
wanton destruction of villages and towns. This was a war measured not so much in 
battles and confrontations between combatants as in attacks upon civilian popula-
tions. Its awesome climax was the destruction of much of Freetown [the capital] in

Liberia” in Sesay (2003).

January 1. (Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Volume 2, Chapter 
1: Executive Summary, Freetown: TRC, 1–2)
Various organizations and individuals around the world have extensively document-
ed these atrocities and war crimes which formed the basis for the Special Court that 
was set up in the country to try those who bore “the greatest responsibility for the 
atrocities” committed during the war.1
The brutality and “uncivil” character of the war also caught the attention and 
imagination of the international community and in particular, the sub-regional eco-
nomic  grouping,  the  Economic  Community  of  West  African  States,  ECOWAS, 
which tried valiantly to bring it to an end.2 The July 1999 Lome Agreement between 
the Government of Sierra Leone and the RUF provided for a Truth and Reconcili-
ation Commission to bring about national reconciliation especially between perpe-
trators of atrocities and victims of the war. The next section examines some of the 
literature on TRCs as post conflict reconciliation and peace building mechanisms.
6. Trcs and post conflict reconciliation: a synoptic review of the literature
The literature on Truth Commissions is still nascent, much of it reflecting the fact 
that there is no universal agreement on what constitutes “truth” and “reconcilia-
tion”3 not least in post conflict contexts. What is presented in this essay, therefore, 
does not pretend to be exhaustive. Rather, it is meant to capture and highlight some 
of the key issues in post conflict reconciliation in general, and in particular, as they 
relate to the Sierra Leonean experience since 2002.
According to Ilan Lax, one time member of the South African Truth and Rec-
onciliation  Commission,  “reconciliation  is  a  journey  not  an  event.  What  Truth 
Commissions  seem  to  do  is  help  nations  set  out  on  the  journey  from  a  proper 
footing.”(Lax 2001).  In other words, Truth and Reconciliation Commissions like 
that in South Africa, and in Sierra Leone, do not provide “quick fixes” to the lega-
cies of punitive actions or to the challenges of reconciliation in post conflict socie-
ties. Rather, they act as “first aid” kits, “guides” or “signposts” on the long road to 
national settlement and post conflict peace building. It is assumed that the transi-
tion from war to peace and national reconciliation will be long and tortuous, but 
1. See Lomé Agreement for details on this.
2. The literature on the peace keeping and conflict management operations of the Economic Com-
munity of West African States, ECOWAS, is rich. See the following for instance, Vogt (1992), 
Adebajo (2002), Sesay (1999b, 2000, 2002 and 2002). A diverse collection of literature on ECO-
MOG can also be found on the website of the Washington, D.C. International Peace Academy, 
IPA.

necessary and expedient if stability and sustainable long-term peace are to be ac-
complished. This logic, no doubt, informed some of the expectations of the TRC 
in Sierra Leone; including those of President Tejan Kabbah and his ministers at its 
inauguration in 2002. According to the Supplement to the Sierra Leone Gazette, 
the Commission was mandated: 
to create an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights and 
international humanitarian law related to the armed conflict in Sierra Leone from 
the beginning of the conflict in 11 to the signing of the Lome Peace Agreement; 
to address impunity, to respond to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and 
reconciliation and to prevent a repetition of the violations and abuses suffered. 
And to the Attorney General, the Commission would  
investigate and report on the causes, nature and extent of the violations and abus-
es…to work to restore the human dignity of victims and promote reconciliation by 
providing an opportunity for victims to give an account of the violations and abuses 
suffered and for the perpetrators to relate their experiences, and creating a climate 
which  fosters  constructive  interchange  between  victims  and  perpetrators,  giving 
special attention to the subject of sexual abuses and to the experiences of children 
within the armed conflict…
The TRC would expose atrocities committed during the war and 
the suffering of the victims is to be acknowledged and,  in deserving cases, repara-
tions are to be made to the victims. …the main purpose of the TRC is to heal the 
wounds of the nation. Thus, far from being faultfinding and punitive, it is to serve 
as the most legitimate and credible forum for victims to reclaim their human worth, 
and a channel for the perpetrators of atrocities to expiate their guilt and chasten their 
conscience. The process is likened to a national catharsis, involving truth telling, 
respectful listening and above all, compensation for victims in deserving cases…1
Finally, the Report of the Commission was to contain 
… recommendation concerning the reforms and other measures, whether legal, po-
litical, administrative or otherwise needed to achieve the object of the commission, 
namely the object of providing impartial historical record, preventing the repetition 
of the violations or abuses suffered, addressing the impunity, responding to the needs 
of the victims and promoting healing and reconciliation (Truth and Reconciliation 
Act, Supplement to the Sierra Leone Gazette, Vol. CXXXI, No. 9, Freetown, Febru-
ary 10, 2000, p .4). 
Official statements from highly placed political figures in the country during and 
after the inauguration clearly indicate that the Sierra Leone TRC was expected to

contribute significantly to post conflict peace building efforts. In fact, it is not a 
hyperbole to say that in some respects, the truth commission was anticipated to per-
form almost “magical” functions; heal the wounds inflicted on individuals, families, 
communities and the nation during the rebel war. The TRC was also to provide 
succour to the victims and enable the perpetrators not only to purge their minds and 
heave a sigh of relief, but also to obtain forgiveness for their transgression, thereby 
paving the way for their reintegration into the society. 
Unfortunately, TRC documents and official comments on what the truth com-
mission processes were expected to achieve in Sierra Leone, did not say at what point 
reconciliation should commence – is it immediately after the cessation of hostilities 
when the wounds are still fresh or after a time-lag when the wounds have healed 
enough? These themes were the focus of the IDEA (2005) report on “Reconciliation 
Lessons Learned from United Nations Peacekeeping Missions: Case Studies from 
Sierra Leone and Timor L’Este”. By way of a preface to the report, Mark Salter noted 
the need to understand the comparative experiences of, and lessons from, the United 
Nations involvements in advancing transitional justice and reconciliation, especially 
in regard of the role of external actors in supporting and promoting national and 
local processes of reconciliation. A central theme in this regard, is the primacy of 
local agency and capacity –  in terms of ownership, design and management – in the 
delivery of acceptable and sustainable reconciliation, leaving the international com-
munity with the responsibility for providing support and assistance. There is also 
the need to situate reconciliation to suit a country’s historical and cotemporary ex-
periences and situations, instead of imposing general “one-size-fits-all” frameworks 
that are likely to woefully fail in the end. It is therefore important to bear in mind, 
according to Salter, that the need for reconciliation is not a sufficient condition for 
post-war peace-building without also vigorously pursuing justice. His conclusions, 
then, include the following: (1) the need to create a synergy between government 
institutions, local non-governmental organizations and other groups on the ground, 
as well the international community, in designing and implementing reconciliation 
processes; and (2) the need to tackle the problem of sustainability and the potential 
conflict enhancing impacts of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions - including 
paying attention to problems associated with a country’s attempt to address the ma-
terial and social legacies of protracted violent conflicts and civil wars. 
Björn Petersson (2005:8–9) proposed understanding, first, the character of re-
cent  violent  internal  conflicts  before  designing  reconciliation  packages  given  the 
multiple sources of different conflicts in different countries. In the main, according 
to him, sustainable reconciliation should be a “context-specific, home-grown and 
long-term” process “made up of a number of ingredients, including “truth”, “jus-
tice” and reparations to victims”. In the case of Sierra Leone, “the public discourse is 
more about individual forgiveness than about justice and reparations”; two critical 
ingredients  underlying  the  success  of  such  exercises.  Reviewing  the  Sierra  Leone 
1
A m a d u   S e s a y
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (SLTRC), Petterson identified several of its 
shortcomings. For one, although it had a mandate “to respond to the needs of the 
victims”, it could not cope with the deluge of requests for material benefits (p. 10). 
In  addition,  the  Commission  was  too  “process-oriented”,  focusing  as  it  were,  on 
public truth-telling that was expected to lead to forgiveness, while overlooking the 
need to prioritize the issues of reparations as an important step towards true recon-
ciliation. Moreover the Commission focused too much on the pursuit of individual 
and community reconciliation communicated in an imposed fashion, and failed to 
effectively mobilize the public. Further shortcomings were the lack of partnership 
between the Commission and key local institutions, time and resource constraints 
as well as its excessive workload, the reluctance of people in high places to testify 
at public hearings, and the less than enthusiastic role of the Government of Sierra 
Leone, to mention a few. 
Another important point has to do with the role of the international commu-
nity. According to Petterson, this could be very crucial in terms of measuring the 
success or otherwise of truth and reconciliation commissions. This, according to 
him, is particularly so as extreme care must be taken if such international support 
is not to fall short of popular expectations, or end up as “remote control”, a situa-
tion whereby international support is reduced to “visiting periodically and sending 
trouble-shooters when necessary” (2005:19). In the latter case, the capacity of the 
international community to fully “grasp the on-going dynamics in and around the 
Commission and to effectively assess the current and future needs in the area of 
reconciliation, is significantly eroded”. Finally, Petterson was very critical about the 
effectiveness of government in addressing the many causes of the Sierra Leone civil 
war,  because  “[Reconciliation]  is  not  only  an  inter-personal  and  inter-communal 
process but also linked to government policies and structural macro-level reforms 
to address the original causes of the conflict” (2005:23). This, in part, is where the 
much-suggested political will on the part of President Tejan Kabbah’s government 
becomes relevant and immediate. 
Like Sierra Leone, according to Chris Dolan (2005), East Timor is another 
small country – coming out of long years of competing European colonial claims 
between Portugal and Holland, and later, Indonesian rule – at the centre of massive 
international attention and intervention. He outlined the sequence of occupations 
and transitional periods leading to the considerable legacy of wounds and divisions 
in contemporary East Timor; reviewed the role of key actors involved in address-
ing the myriad post-conflict challenges, including their respective views and agen-
das; and the implications of making reparation a priority over and above bringing 
perpetrators to justice; highlighted key elements of the multi-pronged approach to 
reconciliation and justice under the auspices of the UN Transitional Authority in 
East Timor (UNTAET); and whether, if implemented more strategically, external 
interventions  in  East  Timor’s  transitional  justice  and  reconciliation  could  offer  a 
1
D o e s   O n e   S i z e   F i t   A l l ?
model for other post-conflict situations. Finally, he examined some of the limita-
tions – especially the relatively narrow focus on particular elements of a far larger 
legacy of injustice – which had not taken cognizance of the underlying psychologi-
cal needs of both individuals and communities.  
Drawing on lessons from 26 country case studies in Central and South Amer-
ica,  Southern  and  Eastern  Europe,  Asia  and  Africa,  Sriram  (2001:91–107)  chal-
lenged  the  common  treatment  in  the  transitional  justice  literature  of  the  peace/
justice trade-offs as overly simplistic, if not a false dichotomy, and in the process, 
illustrated  what  she  described  as  the  more  nuanced  set  of  choices  that  make  ac-
countability more or less possible (p. 103). According to her, beyond their inherent 
“moral virtues”, “sacrifice of justice for the sake of stability”, or indeed the “official 
acknowledgment of wrongdoing” that truth commissions possess, the “choice is not 
a simple one of “punish or pardon”, but rather, there exists a continuum of options 
available to transitional regimes and international actors who seek to assist them, 
ranging from complete amnesty through commission of inquiry and lustration, to 
wide-ranging prosecutions”. She identified three factors that make accountability 
more or less possible: the international political and historical contexts, the history 
of past abuses, and the nature of civilian-military relations and/or the balance of 
power between the government and the opposition (p. 91). 
In her view, while reformers need not cater excessively for the security forces, 
“recognising their corporate interests and incentives may enable new, often fragile, 
regimes not only to avert crises but to institute healthier civil-military relations in 
the long-run” (p. 92). Rather than refute the claim that accountability entails some 
degree of moral compromise, Sriram highlighted instead, “the benefits which some 
trade-offs might reap in the realm of institutional, political and military reforms, 
which can, in turn, yield significant benefits for future protection of democracy, sta-
bility and human rights” (pp. 92–93). Invariably, “the desire for justice on the part of 
victims could increase with the aggregation of abuses”, but also “exhaustion from the
