It cost me quite some time to figure out that if I want to have a structured
representation of my underlying decision tree I can use the `tree_` attribute
of the DecisionTreeClassifier at the bottom of the attribute list. Further
down the bottom there is also an example 'Understanding the decision tree
structure'.
However it personally took me days to figure all of this out. Mainly because I
was under the assumption that `tree_` is intended as a private member.
It is my humble opinion that the documentation is improved significantly if it
is extended with sklearn.tree.Tree API reference together with an additional
small treatise on the decision tree info page similar as how the
`export_graphviz` usage is discussed.
