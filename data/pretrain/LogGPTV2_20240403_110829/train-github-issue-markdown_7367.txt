I'm currently writing a webserver application using hapijs (nodejs). I have a
bunch of plugins which I want to write in Typescript. A Hapijs plugin needs a
function called `register()` and an attributes function property with a name
and version:
    register(server, options, next) {
    }
    register.attributes = {
        name: 'plugin',
        version: '0.1.0'
    };
When I want to compile this code, I always get
    lib/plugins/plugin.ts(2,5): 2300 Duplicate identifier 'register'.
    lib/plugins/plugin.ts(8,12): 2300 Duplicate identifier 'register'.
I don't know the specs very well but I'm wondering whether it should be
allowed or not?
