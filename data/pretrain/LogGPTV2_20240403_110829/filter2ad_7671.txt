1. Security property determination 
The  security  properties  of  Information  Technology 
(IT) products and systems are important to the national 
security, critical infrastructure, and economic health of 
advanced society.  These properties are studied, tested, 
and  evaluated  to  provide  information  for  decisions 
concerning trustworthiness and suitability for purpose.   
future 
approaches 
these  determinations.  Following 
panelist’s  opening  statements  the  moderator  will  ask 
important  provocative  questions  and  accept  questions 
from  the  audience.    The  following  questions  are 
indicative of the discussion. 
This  panel  will  address  present  and 
to 
1. There appears to be a paradigm shift in process. 
What  is  happening  in  and  between  the  schemes 
described below and similar activities in other sectors? 
2. All organizations have resource limitations (e.g., 
skill,  time,  money).  What  are  the  most  cost-effective 
activities in improving the security of IT products and 
systems  using  in  the  normal  conduct  of  enterprise 
business,  in  critical  infrastructure,  and  in  national 
defense? 
3.  Systems  involve  multiple  products,  integrators, 
evaluated products, "glueware" that melds the products 
into  systems.  Should  efforts  focus  on  the  weakest 
links? What can be done? How can information gained 
in each activity be reused? 
2.  Acquisition 
communities
and 
the 
security 
For  years  the  acquisition  community  and  the 
security community have struggled to come together in 
a  fashion  that  would  result  in  successful  procurement 
of  very 
large  systems  with  appropriate  security 
properties.    A  major  issue  has  often  been  that  the 
security  engineers  articulated  their  design  using  their 
own  paradigm  and  language  while  the  acquisition 
community  procured  systems  and  components  using  a 
different  paradigm  and  language.    Only  at  the  very 
highest  levels  of  reference  has  the  procurement 
paradigm  and  security  community  language  come 
together in an attempt to acquire secure systems.  Even 
at this highest level of specification, most procurement 
level 
strategies  have  been  based  on  product 
specification  without  consideration  of  the  security 
properties of the system as a whole. 
3. Specification of security properties 
In  principle  the  specification  of  security  properties 
should  be  no  different  than  the  specification  of  other 
properties of the system.  One should anticipate typical 
conflicts  among  specifications  and  goals.    Trade-offs 
will have to be made when all specifications and goals 
cannot be achieved.  The customer will be involved in 
some  of  the  decisions  concerning  trade-offs  and  will 
help 
the 
specifications and goals as well as the system.

The  International  Standard  ISO/IEC  15408  [1],  the 
Common  Criteria  (CC)  for  Information  Technology 
Security  Evaluation,  provides  a  model  for  specifying 
and  evaluating  security  properties  of  COTS  products 
and small systems.   
The US is represented within the CC Project by the 
National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), a 
joint  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology 
(NIST)  and  National  Security  Agency  (NSA)  project.  
NIAP,  in  turn,  has  established  the  Common  Criteria 
Evaluation  and  Validation  Scheme  (CCEVS) 
to
