#### Creating an SNMP Interceptor (Policy)

- An SNMP Interceptor is a type of HP OM policy (HP OM SNMP Policy Type) with rules and actions. These policies can be configured using the HP OM UI, Operations Manager for Windows (OMW), or Operations Manager for Linux (OML). They are uploaded from policy files using the HP OM `ovpmutil` tool.
- The Forwarding Connector sends security events as SNMP traps to an HP OM SNMP Interceptor that you will create. The Interceptor should be configured to monitor SNMP events and respond when a specific pattern is found in an SNMP message.
- ArcSight provides a template interceptor (policy) for creating your own customized SNMP Interceptor. This template policy should be customized and enhanced to meet different needs and requirements using HP OM's powerful policy edit features.

#### Uploading Interceptor Template

- **Step 1:** Navigate to `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\user\agent\hpompolicy`. This folder contains policy files as a basic SNMP interceptor template.
- **Step 2:** The following files are provided in the ArcSight Events folder:
  - `157F1ADF-B7A5-4328-8175-5D370D6EC4A9_data`
  - `157F1ADF-B7A5-4328-8175-5D370D6EC4A9_header.xml`
  - `PolicyConfig_EE72B589-0893-4EC1-899B-502DE1289DBF.xml`

#### Using Operations Manager for Windows

- **Step 1:** Copy the `hpompolicy` folder from `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\user\agent` to the destination HP OM (OMW, the Windows version of HP OM) machine's `C:\temp` directory.
- **Step 2:** Use the following command to upload the policy:
  ```sh
  C:\Program Files\HP\HP BTO Software\bin\win64>ovpmutil CFG POL UPL "C:\temp\hpompolicy"
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  - Root policy group "for ArcSight Integration" uploading:
  - Policies upload completed successfully.

#### Using Operations Manager for Linux

- **Step 1:** Copy the `hpompolicy` folder from `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\user\agent` to the destination HP OM machine's `/tmp` directory.
- **Step 2:** Use the following command to upload the policy:
  ```sh
  /opt/OV/bin/OpC/utils/opcpolicy -upload dir=/tmp/hpompolicy/"ArcSight Events"
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  - Operation successfully completed.

#### Deploying the Policy

- Once you have created your customized Interceptor, deploy or assign the policy through the HP Operations Manager UI (for Windows) or HP Operations Manager Administration UI (for Linux). For detailed instructions, refer to the HP Operations Manager online help and documentation.

#### Adjusting the Event Processing Rate

- The default event processing rate for forwarding events from ESM to HP OM is 50 events per second (eps). If this rate is excessive for your system, HP OM may queue incoming events, affecting the processing rate. You can adjust the rate by changing the event processing rate within your XML properties file.

**Steps to Adjust the Event Processing Rate:**

1. Stop the currently running SmartConnector.
2. From a Windows command line, access your XML properties file using the command:
   ```sh
   cd %ARCSIGHT_HOME%/current/user/agent
   ```
3. Use WordPad or any XML Editor to open the `.xml` file for your HP OM destination, similar to the example below:
   - `0Ajv5S8BABCAAeabNXP5Rw==.xml`
4. Search for the following line in the `.xml` file:
   - `ProcessingSettings.ThrottleRate="50"`
   - Change this value to the desired rate of events per second. For example, to lower the rate to 10 eps, change the value to 10:
     ```xml
     ProcessingSettings.ThrottleRate="10"
     ```
5. If there are multiple destinations, repeat the steps above to change the rate for each destination, as required.
6. Save the `.xml` file and exit the XML editor.
7. Restart the SmartConnector.

#### Using the Forwarding Connector in FIPS Mode

- **What is FIPS?**
  - Under the Information Technology Management Reform Act (Public Law 104-106), the Secretary of Commerce approves standards and guidelines developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for Federal computer systems. These standards and guidelines are issued by NIST as Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for government-wide use. FIPS compatibility applies only to standard ESM and Logger destinations.

- **ArcSight ESM Installation:**
  - Before installing an ArcSight Forwarding Connector, ensure that ArcSight ESM has been installed correctly for FIPS compliance. Refer to the "Standard Installation Procedures" on page 7 for instructions. It is also recommended to read the ArcSight ESM Installation and Configuration Guide before attempting to install a new Forwarding Connector.

- **FIPS-Enabled Forwarding Connector Installation:**
  - Follow the instructions under "Installing the Forwarding Connector" up to and including step 2. After completing step 2, perform the necessary configuration steps for NSS DB to install the connector in FIPS-compliant mode.

**Steps to Install FIPS-Enabled Forwarding Connector:**

1. Click Cancel to exit connector setup to configure the NSS DB.
2. Create a properties file at the following location:
   - `$ARCSIGHT_HOME/user/agent/agent.properties`
3. Add the following line to the file:
   - `fips.enabled=true`
4. Copy your key files for source and destination Managers (e.g., `srcmgrkey.cert` and `destmgrkey.cert`) into the `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\bin` directory.
5. Turn off FIPS enablement on the new installation using the following command:
   ```sh
   arcsight runmodutil –fips false –dbdir user/agent/nssdb.client
   ```
6. Import the certificates for the source and destination Managers using the following commands:
   - Import the source Manager’s certificate:
     ```sh
     arcsight runcertutil –A –n srcmgrkey –t "CT,C,C" –d user/agent/nssdb.client –i bin/srcmgrkey.cert
     ```
   - Display the contents of the source Manager’s certificate:
     ```sh
     arcsight runcertutil –L –n srcmgrkey –t "CT,C,C" –d user/agent/nssdb.client
     ```
   - Import the destination Manager’s certificate:
     ```sh
     arcsight runcertutil –A –n destmgrkey –t "CT,C,C" –d user/agent/nssdb.client –i bin/destmgrkey.cert
     ```
   - Display the contents of the destination Manager’s certificate:
     ```sh
     arcsight runcertutil –L –n destmgrkey –t "CT,C,C" –d user/agent/nssdb.client
     ```
   - Ensure that your host name matches the Manager’s certificate name and is DNS resolvable.
7. Re-enable FIPS using the following command:
   ```sh
   arcsight runmodutil –fips true –dbdir user/agent/nssdb.client
   ```
8. Return to connector setup by entering the following command from the `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\bin` directory:
   ```sh
   arcsight connectorsetup
   ```
9. When prompted to start in Wizard Mode, click Yes.
10. In the Destination selection window, select ArcSight Manager (encrypted) and click Next.
11. Enter the Manager Host Name and Manager Port. Ensure that the host name and manager’s certificate name match and are DNS resolvable. Click Next.
12. Enter a valid ArcSight User Name and Password, and click Next.
13. Choose the appropriate Forwarding Connector version. If you are using ESM v4.0 SP3 or later, ArcSight recommends choosing the ArcSight Forwarding Connector (Enhanced) option. Click Next.
14. Enter the information to configure the Forwarding Connector. Ensure that the host name and manager certificate name match and are DNS resolvable. Click Next.
15. Enter a name for the connector and provide other identifying information. Click Next.
16. Read the connector summary. If it is correct, click Next. If not, click Previous to make changes.
17. When the connector completes its configuration, click Next. The wizard will prompt you to choose whether to run the connector as a process or as a service. If you choose to run it as a service, the wizard will prompt you to define service parameters.
18. After making your selections, click Next. The wizard will display a dialog confirming the connector's setup and service configuration.
19. Click Finish.

#### Enabling FIPS Suite B Support

- If you have installed a SmartConnector in FIPS-compliant mode, you can enable FIPS Suite B support by modifying the ESM destination parameters. The Manager must also be installed in FIPS Suite B mode.

**Steps to Enable FIPS Suite B Support:**

1. Open `agent.properties` from `$ARCSIGHT_HOME\current\user\agent` to edit.
2. Locate the following property for ESM destination parameters (approximately, line 10 in the file):
   ```properties
   agents[0].destination[0].params=\n\n    \n    \n    \n 
   \n    \n\n
   ```
3. The destination parameters are specified here as an XML string where each element is one parameter. Based on the Suite B mode of the Manager, change `fipsDefault` to `suiteb128` (for 128-bit security) or `suiteb192` (for 192-bit security).
4. Save and exit `agent.properties`.

#### Using Logger in FIPS Mode

- ArcSight Logger supports the Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (FIPS 140-2). For complete instructions on using Logger in FIPS mode, refer to the ArcSight Logger Administrator's Guide and see "Installing or Updating a SmartConnector to be FIPS-compliant" in Chapter 7, "System Admin."
