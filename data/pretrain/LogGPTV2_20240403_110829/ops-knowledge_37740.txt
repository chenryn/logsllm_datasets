User: I've been learning Python, and I keep running into the $ character in online documentation. Usually it goes something like this:
$ python ez_setup.py (Yeah, I've been trying to install setup tools)
I'm fairly certain that this command isn't for the python IDE or console, but I've tried windows cmd and it doesn't work. Any help?
Assistant: The $ is the command prompt. It is used to signify that python ez_setup.py should be run on a command line and not on a python/perl/ruby shell
You might also see % python ez_setup.py, which also means the same thing
