I have developed a simple webcam recorder for Linux, and it performs quite well, delivering approximately 25 frames per second (fps) with good audio quality. However, I am currently porting this recorder to Windows 7, and while the application runs, its performance is unacceptable. The `QueryFrame` function takes over 350 milliseconds to execute, resulting in a frame rate of only about 2.5 fps.

The code is written in Python, but the issue seems to be related to the library call. I tested both on the same machine using the same Logitech E2500 webcam. On Windows, I installed OpenCV version 2.2, whereas the version on Ubuntu might be slightly higher. 

I recently updated to OpenCV 2.4, but the slow speed persists. Do you have any suggestions on what might be causing this problem?

**Response:**

I encountered a similar issue and discovered that it was due to prolonged exposure settings. It's possible that the Windows drivers are increasing the exposure to enhance the brightness of the image. You can try pointing your camera at a light source or manually set a lower exposure value to see if this improves the performance.
