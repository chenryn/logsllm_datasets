From version 0.9.0 to version 0.11.0 the "diagonal" on non quadratic pairplots
is empty.
Sample Code:
    import seaborn as sns
    import pandas as pd 
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    test_df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1,2,3,4], "b": [3,4,5,6], "c": [5,3,6,1]})
    sns.pairplot(test_df, x_vars=["a"], y_vars=["b", "c"])
    plt.show()
The top graph is empty although a scatter plot should be shown in place as the
two columns have matching indices.
