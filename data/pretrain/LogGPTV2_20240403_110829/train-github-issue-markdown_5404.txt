Certainly! Here is a more polished and professional version of your text:

In the latest version of Julia (where the conditional expression evaluates to `true`), the following code works as expected:

```julia
julia> module MyMod
           """
           A docstring
           """
           macro mymac(ex)
               return esc(ex)
           end
       end
Main.MyMod

help?> MyMod.@mymac
  A docstring
```

However, if you place the macro definition inside a conditional block (e.g., based on the Julia version), the docstring is not recognized:

```julia
julia> module MyMod
           if VERSION >= v"1.2.0"
               """
               A docstring
               """
               macro mymac(ex)
                   return esc(ex)
               end
           end
       end
WARNING: replacing module MyMod.
Main.MyMod

help?> MyMod.@mymac
  No documentation found.
  Main.MyMod.@mymac is a macro.
  # 1 method for macro "@mymac":
  [1] @mymac(__source__::LineNumberNode, __module__::Module, ex) in Main.MyMod at REPL[3]:8
```

To resolve this issue, you can use the `@doc` macro to attach the docstring after the macro definition:

```julia
julia> module MyMod
           if VERSION >= v"1.2.0"
               macro mymac(ex)
                   return esc(ex)
               end
               @doc "A docstring" :(MyMod.@mymac)
           end
       end
WARNING: replacing module MyMod.
Main.MyMod

help?> MyMod.@mymac
  A docstring
```

This approach ensures that the docstring is correctly associated with the macro, even when the macro is defined conditionally.
