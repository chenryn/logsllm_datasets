To effectively implement CIS Control 9.2, which recommends the use of DNS filtering services, an organization should follow these main procedures:

1. **Assessment and Planning:**
   - **Identify Assets:** Conduct a thorough inventory of all enterprise assets that require protection, including servers, workstations, and mobile devices.
   - **Risk Assessment:** Evaluate the current risk landscape, including known malicious domains and potential threats.
   - **Policy Development:** Develop a clear policy for DNS filtering, outlining the criteria for blocking or allowing access to specific domains.

2. **Selection and Deployment:**
   - **Choose a DNS Filtering Service:** Select a reputable DNS filtering service that aligns with the organization's security requirements and budget. Consider factors such as ease of integration, performance, and support.
   - **Configure the Service:** Set up the DNS filtering service according to the organizationâ€™s policy. This includes configuring blocklists, allowlists, and any other necessary settings.
   - **Deployment:** Roll out the DNS filtering service across all identified enterprise assets. Ensure that the deployment is phased and monitored to minimize disruptions.

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - **Continuous Monitoring:** Regularly monitor the DNS filtering service to ensure it is functioning correctly and to detect any attempts to access malicious domains.
   - **Update and Patch Management:** Keep the DNS filtering service and related systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
   - **Incident Response:** Establish a plan for responding to incidents, such as attempted access to blocked domains. This should include logging, alerting, and escalation procedures.

4. **Training and Awareness:**
   - **User Training:** Educate employees about the importance of DNS filtering and how it helps protect the organization from cyber threats.
   - **Awareness Campaigns:** Conduct regular awareness campaigns to keep employees informed about new threats and best practices for staying safe online.

By following these procedures, an organization can effectively implement CIS Control 9.2, enhancing its network security and protecting against known malicious domains. This control falls under the asset type "Network" and serves the security function of "Protect."
