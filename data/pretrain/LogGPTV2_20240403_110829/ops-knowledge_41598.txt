User: I'm writing a chat application using Google App Engine. I would like chats to be logged. Unfortunately, the Google App Engine datastore only lets you write to it once per second. To get around this limitation, I was thinking of using a memcache to buffer writes. In order to ensure that no data is lost, I need to periodically push the data from the memcache into the data store. 
Is there any way to schedule jobs like this on Google App. Engine? Or am I going about this in entirely the wrong way?
I'm using the Python version of the API, so a Python solution would be preferred, but I know Java well enough that I could translate a Java solution into Python.
Assistant: I think you could create tasks which will persist the data.  This has the advantage that, unlike memcached the tasks are persisted and so no chats would be lost.  
when a new chat comes in, create a task to save the chat data.  In the task handler do the persist.  You could either configure the task queue to pull at 1 per second (or slightly slower) and save each bit of chat data held in the task persist the incoming chats in a temporary table (in different entity groups), and every have the tasks pull all unsaved chats from the temporary table, persist them to the chat entity then remove them from the temporary table.
