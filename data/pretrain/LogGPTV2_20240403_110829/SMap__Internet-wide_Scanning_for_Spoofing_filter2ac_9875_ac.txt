### Measurements and Challenges

When conducting measurements against servers, several factors can complicate the process:

1. **Client Mobility and Network Intermediaries**:
   - Clients frequently move between networks and change IP addresses.
   - Clients are often located behind intermediate devices such as Network Address Translators (NAT) and firewalls, which can prevent direct measurements.

2. **Geolocation Inaccuracies**:
   - Geolocation tools may be inaccurate, but this is not a concern for our study since we do not need to know the location to measure ingress filtering.

3. **Additional Network Mechanisms**:
   - Other network mechanisms, such as anycast, rerouting, traffic shaping, and transient network failures, can also affect measurements.
   - These factors may cause us to classify a server as "not testable," but they do not impact the "spoofable" outcomes.

4. **IPID Measurement Methods**:
   - Previous studies have used TCP-RST packets to increment IPIDs, but these packets are often blocked by firewalls.
   - In contrast, we use packets that are less likely to be blocked, such as DNS queries or TCP-SYN packets.

### Inferring Spoofing with IPID Technique

To infer spoofing, we use the following components:

- A prober at IP address 7.7.7.7.
- A server at IP address 1.2.3.7 that uses globally incremental IPIDs, as illustrated in Figure 4.

#### Steps:

1. **Measurement of IPID Values**:
   - Using the prober at 7.7.7.7, we measure the value of the IPID and the rate at which it increments.
   - We use linear regression with the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method to estimate the relationship between IPID and timestamp \( t \).
   - The incremental nature of IPID can be modeled as: \( \text{IPID} = a \cdot t + b + \epsilon \), where \( \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) \).

2. **Estimation of Parameters**:
   - We send \( N \) probes to 7.7.7.7 to estimate \( a \), \( b \), and \( \sigma \) using the OLS method.

3. **Sending Spoofed Packets**:
   - We send a set of \( M = 6 \cdot \sigma \) packets from a spoofed source IP address 1.2.3.6 (belonging to the probed network).

4. **Sampling IPID Value**:
   - At time \( T_{M+N+1} \), we sample the IPID value \( Z = \text{IPID}_{\text{real}}^{M+N+1} \) from the server using the prober’s real IP address 7.7.7.7.

5. **Verification**:
   - We check the IPID value \( Z \) and calculate \( \text{IPID}_{\text{esti}}^{M+N+1} \) at time \( T_{M+N+1} \).
   - If the spoofed packets are filtered, according to the 3-sigma rule, there is a 99.73% probability that:
     \[
     \text{IPID}_{\text{esti}}^{M+N+1} - 3 \cdot \sigma \leq Z \leq \text{IPID}_{\text{esti}}^{M+N+1} + 3 \cdot \sigma
     \]
   - If the spoofed packets are not blocked, the IPID counter should have an additional increment of \( M \). Thus, \( Z > \text{IPID}_{\text{esti}}^{M+N+1} + 3 \cdot \sigma \) or \( Z > \text{IPID}_{\text{esti}}^{M+N+1} + \frac{M}{2} \).

### Path Maximum Transmission Unit Discovery (PMTUD)

PMTUD determines the maximum transmission unit (MTU) size on the network path between two IP hosts. The process involves setting the Don’t Fragment (DF) bit in IP headers. Any router along the path with a smaller MTU will drop the packet and send back an ICMP Fragmentation Needed / Packet Too Big (PTB) message.

#### PMTUD Process:

- The ICMP PTB message contains the IP header and the first 8 bytes of the original packet, along with the MTU of the router that sent the ICMP message.
- After receiving an ICMP PTB message, the source host should either reduce its path MTU appropriately or unset the DF bit.

A 2017 study of CAIDA datasets found that 3 million ICMP fragmentation needed packets were sent by routers in the Internet, with about 1,000 routers sending ICMP error messages with a next-hop MTU of less than 500 bytes [20].

### Outcomes of Tests

We define the outcomes of tests using the IPID technique as follows:

- **Spoofable**: No filtering.
- **Applicable**: Server with globally incremental IPID.
- **Non-applicable**: Random IPID, per-destination IPID, or IPID=0.
- **N/A**: Host unreachable, firewall, packet loss, or load balancer.

### PMTUD-Based Testing

The core idea of the PMTUD-based tool is to send an ICMP PTB message from a spoofed source IP address, belonging to the tested network, and insert the real IP address of the prober in the 8-byte payload of the ICMP. If the network does not enforce ingress filtering, the server will receive the PMTUD message and reduce the MTU to the specified IP address.

#### Methodology:

1. **Probing the MTU**:
   - Establish a TCP connection to a server on the tested network.
   - Send Request1 and receive Response1. If the DF bit is not set, the server does not support PMTUD.
   - Otherwise, send an ICMP PTB with a smaller MTU.
   - Request again and get Response2. If DF1 == 1 and (DF2 == 0 or size2 ≤ size1), the server supports PMTUD.

2. **Testing Ingress Filtering**:
   - Spoof an ICMP PTB with the smallest MTU, using the server’s neighbor IP as the source IP address.
   - Make another request. The server is not protected by ingress filtering if the following condition applies: size3 ≤ size2 or (DF2 == 1 and DF3 == 0).

### DNS Lookup

DNS provides lookup services to networks. Upon receiving a DNS request, the resolver performs the lookup of the requested domain name and returns the response with the requested record.

#### Methodology:

1. **Sending a DNS Request**:
   - Send a DNS request to the tested network from a spoofed IP address belonging to the tested network.
   - If the network does not enforce ingress filtering, the request will arrive at the DNS resolver on that network.

2. **Monitoring DNS Requests**:
   - Use the payload of the DNS request to trigger a query to our controlled Name servers.
   - Monitor for DNS requests arriving at our Name servers. If a query for the requested record arrives from the tested network, we mark the network as not enforcing ingress filtering.

### Identifying DNS Resolvers

The main challenge is to locate the DNS resolvers within a domain/network and trigger a DNS request to our Name servers. We use the Email service in the target networks (retrieved via the MX type request in the target domain) to find the DNS resolvers. By monitoring the DNS queries at our Name servers, we collect the IP addresses of the resolvers.

### Internet-Wide Measurements

Our dataset collection with SMap has been ongoing since July 2019, covering over 6 million domains and the entire IPv4 address block.

#### Dataset Construction:

- We periodically download the entire IPv4 scan from the Sonar Project.
- We use the scan results on UDP port 53 for Name servers and DNS resolvers, TCP port 25 for Mail servers, and TCP port 80 for Web servers.
- We also utilize forward and reverse DNS responses from the Sonar Project to find hostnames of servers.

#### Results:

- Our latest dataset includes services hosted in 63,522 ASes, with 4,256,598 DNS servers in 38,838 ASes, 16,478,938 Email servers in 38,937 ASes, and 62,455,254 Web servers in 61,535 ASes.

### Ingress Filtering Results

Both domain scans and IPv4 scans show that the number of spoofable ASes grows with the overall number of ASes in the Internet. There is a correlation between the fraction of spoofable ASes and the total number of ASes.
