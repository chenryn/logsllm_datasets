 ~~It seems the only documentation of model persistence is in the Quick Start
tutorial. I think it needs to be covered in the User Guide, mentioning
security and forward-compatibility caveats pertaining to pickle. It might note
the benefits of joblib (for large models at least) over Pickle. Most other ML
toolkits (particularly command-line tools) treat persistence as a very basic
operation of the package.~~ (This was fixed in #3317)
Similarly, there should be some comment on saving and loading custom data
(input and output). Indeed, I can't find a direct description of the supported
data-types; users are unlikely to have played with `scipy.sparse` before
(although the `feature_extraction` module means they may not need to). Noting
the benefits of joblib (without which the user may dump a sparse matrix's
`data`, `indices`, `indptr` using `.tofile`) and memmapping is worthwhile. So
may be reference to Pandas which could help manipulate datasets before/after
entering Scikit-learn, and provides import/export to a variety of formats
(http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html).
I have recently discovered new users who think the way to import/export large
sparse arrays is `load_svmlight_format`, but then note that the loading/saving
takes much more time than the processing they're trying to do... Let's give
them a hand.
