The current documentation on model persistence is primarily found in the Quick Start tutorial. However, this topic should also be covered in the User Guide, with a focus on security and forward-compatibility concerns related to using `pickle`. The guide could highlight the advantages of `joblib` (especially for large models) over `pickle`. Most other machine learning toolkits, particularly those with command-line interfaces, treat model persistence as a fundamental feature.

Additionally, there should be clear instructions on saving and loading custom data (both input and output). It would be helpful to provide a direct description of the supported data types. Many users may not have experience with `scipy.sparse`, even though the `feature_extraction` module can often handle this. The benefits of using `joblib`—such as its ability to efficiently save and load sparse matrices without resorting to manually dumping `data`, `indices`, and `indptr` using `.tofile`—should be noted. Additionally, mentioning `memmapping` and `Pandas` could be beneficial, as these tools can help users manipulate datasets before and after using Scikit-learn. `Pandas` also provides import/export capabilities for a variety of formats (see [Pandas I/O](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html)).

Recently, I've encountered new users who believe that `load_svmlight_format` is the best way to import and export large sparse arrays. However, they often find that the loading and saving process takes much longer than the actual processing. We should provide guidance to help them choose more efficient methods.
