User: What are the important indicators of the computer hard disk, and how to detect whether the hard disk fails during use?
Assistant: Important indicators of computer hard drives include capacity, rotational speed, interface type, cache size, lifespan, etc. The following methods can be used to detect whether a hard disk is faulty: 1. Hard disks that include SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology) can monitor the health status of the hard disk in real time. You can use software such as CrystalDiskInfo, HD Tune, etc. to detect the SMART status, and check whether the hard disk has abnormal conditions such as bad sectors, temperature, and vibration. 2. Detect failure by checking hard drive audio. The hard disk will make noise when it is working. If abnormal sound or increased noise is found, it may mean that the hard disk is faulty. 3. Each operating system provides its own disk detection tool. Windows has tools such as Chkdsk, Sfc /scannow, and Disk Cleanup. MacOS can use Disk Utility software. Linux can use the fsck command. 4. Check the data transfer speed. If the data transfer speed drops, it means that there may be a problem with the hard disk, which can be detected by software such as HD Tune. 5. Perform a hard drive self-test. When the computer starts, the hard disk self-test program will run automatically and check the status of the hard disk. 6. Physical inspection. If the hard disk is damaged, the hard disk casing can be observed and inspected. If it shows signs of being dropped or dented, the hard drive may have failed.
