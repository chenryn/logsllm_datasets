I am now using Electron 0.33.6 for some hours in VS Code and run into an issue
that I cannot really reproduce or explain but it happens always after some
time of usage (30 minutes). It might be just memory related when memory
consumption reaches a certain limit.
What I know is that a process (forked with child_process) is crashing with a
SIGABRT signal, which seems to indicate an issue deep down in node or at least
in a C++ layer above with memory allocation. We do have a crash dump when this
happens: https://gist.github.com/bpasero/bbe9001163baca220057
I will try to reproduce this on Windows tomorrow.
I wonder if this is related or duplicate to: #2889
