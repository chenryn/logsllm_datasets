Abstract. On May 15, 2001 ICANN announced the introduction of the biz and
info generic top-level domains (gTLDs)—the ﬁrst new gTLDs since the incep-
tion of the Domain Name System—aiming to “increase consumer choice and
create opportunities for entities that have been shut out under the current name
structure.” The biz gTLD, in particular, was to become an alternative to the pop-
ular com top-level domain.
In this paper we examine the current usage of the biz gTLD in order to de-
termine whether it has evolved into the role intended by ICANN, and whether
concerns expressed in the early discussions of this expansion have been justiﬁed.
In particular, using DNS zone ﬁles, DNS probing, and Web crawler data, we at-
tempt to answer the question of whether biz has become a viable alternative to
com, giving trademark holders who ﬁnd themselves unable to register a com name
an attractive alternative; or whether it has merely induced defensive registrations
by existing trademark holders who already had equivalent com domains.
1 Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS) serves as the main means of giving names to entities
on the Internet. Now over 25 years old, its original goal was to provide a way to con-
sistently map host names to IP addresses. Since then, DNS has grown to identify the
Internet presence of brands, companies, products, political campaigns, and individuals.
Compared to other means of navigating the Internet, DNS has a very rigid lookup
structure: a user must know the name precisely and completely in order to perform a
lookup. While search engines provide a more ﬂexible navigation mechanism, we still
perceive the need for a direct mechanism like the domain system: one that remains
free of third-party mediation, succinct enough to allow expression in print, and easy for
users to act on.
In part for historic reasons, DNS is arranged hierarchically: names associate with a
sufﬁx, usually a top-level domain (TLD). The original DNS design included generic
TLDs (gTLDs) (com, edu, etc.) following administrative considerations, matching the
classes of organizations with Internet hosts to name. The growth of the Web created
the need to name not individual hosts but broader entities. Of the original gTLDs, com
proved the most open and best suited choice, becoming the de facto TLD for Web
addresses.
To the average user, com became synonymous with the Web, its iconic status earning
it a place in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1994. As a consequence of its popular-
ity, the com landscape quickly became crowded. To ease the pressure on com, ICANN

moved to create more gTLDs, introducing biz and info in 2001. The success of this
endeavor hinged on how users would perceive TLDs: whether users accepted the notion
of TLDs as simply reﬂecting different potential homes for various Internet entities, or
whether they viewed “dot com” as the sole TLD where they would expect to ﬁnd promi-
nent Web enterprises. Would users ﬁnd it confusing to encounter the same subdomain
in different TLDs?
A decade has passed since, and ICANN now promotes a new, more open system for
introducing new TLDs which could dramatically change the Domain Name System. To
answer some of these questions, and to re-evaluate some early predictions, this paper
takes stock of the biz gTLD, which largely promoted as an alternative to com. We ﬁnd
that approximately 20% of domains in both biz and com are parked, contrary to original
intention to avoid domain speculation in biz. Furthermore, between 10% and 25% of
biz registrations appear only to exist to defend against name infringement.
The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 gives a background on the biz
TLD with a survey of related work. Section 3 describes our data collection method-
ology, followed by our analysis in Section 4, and a brief discussion of our ﬁndings in
Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.
2 Background
In June 1998, the US Department of Commerce called for the creation of a new not-
for-proﬁt organization to assume responsibility for the technical coordination functions
performed by the IANA. Later that year, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names
and Numbers (ICANN) was formed to fulﬁll that role. ICANN obtained “the authority
to manage and perform a speciﬁc set of functions related to coordination of the domain
name system, including the authority necessary to . . . oversee policy for determining
the circumstances under which new TLDs are added to the root system” [8]. In 1999
ICANN formed the Domain Name Supporting Organization (DNSO), an advisory body
within ICANN, to handle matters concerning the Domain Name System [6], chartering,
within the DNSO, Working Group C to study the issues surrounding the formation of
new generic top-level domains (gTLDs). The Working Group’s task was to gauge the
need for new gTLDs, and, if deemed required, to determine what should be their nature
and deployment policy [3]. In March 2000 Working Group C released its ﬁnal report,
addressing these questions [10]. The ICANN board adopted its recommendations in
July 2000 [5].
2.1 The Working Group C Report
The Working Group C report [10] addressed two important questions: whether to create
new gTLDs, and, if so, how to introduce them. On the need for new gTLDs, the report
argued: “Expanding the number of TLDs will increase consumer choice, and create
opportunities for entities that have been shut out under the current name structure.”
Moreover, the report observes:
Existing second-level domain names under the .com TLD routinely change hands for
enormously inﬂated prices. These are legitimate trades of ordinary, untrademarked words;

their high prices reﬂect the artiﬁcial scarcity of common names in existing gTLDs, and
the premium on .com names in particular.
. . .
If the name space is expanded, companies will be able to get easy-to-remember domain
names more easily, and the entry barriers to successful participation in electronic com-
merce will be lowered. Addition of new TLDs will allow different companies to have the
same second-level domain name in different TLDs (emphasis added).
Arguing against the consensus position of the report, some members of the Working
Group suggested that “an increase in the number of top-level domains could confuse
consumers,” and that expanding the domain space “will likely increase trademark own-
ers’ policing costs and the costs of defensive registrations.” Members expressed con-
cerns about “trademark holders simply duplicating their existing domains” (emphasis
added).
On the nature of the initial rollout, the report weighed two opposing approaches: au-
thorizing “hundreds of new TLDs over the course of the next few years” and introducing
new TLDs “slowly and in a controlled manner, and only after effective trademark pro-
tection mechanisms had been implemented and shown to be effective.” In arguing for
the introduction of many new TLDs, some members argued that “a small number of new
gTLDs with no commitment to add more . . . would encourage pre-emptive and specu-
lative registrations based on the possibility of continued artiﬁcial scarcity” (emphasis
added). The report ultimately proposed “deploying six to ten new TLDs.”
2.2 Recent Studies
In its recent move to open TLD registration to the general public, ICANN commis-
sioned several reports analyzing the economic consequences of their new initiative.
Among other concerns, the reports address the danger that new gTLDs will compel
trademark holders to defensively register their marks in each new TLD. The 2009 Carl-
ton report [2] dismisses this as a problem, arguing that “many registrations that ‘redirect
trafﬁc’ to other sites serve productive purposes of attracting and retaining Internet traf-
ﬁc, not merely to prevent cybersquatting.” Furthermore, the report argues: “While some
of the registrations for domain names under the new gTLDs may have been made for
defensive purposes, the limited number of registrations for new gTLDs indicates that
the vast majority of .com registrants did not ﬁnd a compelling reason to undertake de-
fensive registrations in the new gTLDs.” The 2010 Katz, Rosston, Sullivan report [7]
looked back at past TLD introductions: “A broad look at the evidence to date suggests
that other gTLDs provide little competition for .com as those gTLDs have neither at-
tracted a large number of domains nor shown any signs of catching up with .com.”1
Most closely related to our work is the 2002 survey of biz registrations by Zittrain
and Edelman [11]. They found that 90.5% of names registered in biz also occur in com
(consistent with our ﬁnding). To assess whether biz and com registrants overlapped, the
survey authors examined Whois records, comparing records based on registrant postal
code, email address, and name server second-level domains. They found that 35.4% of
biz-com pairs matched in at least one attribute, 25.8% in two, and 12.9% in all three.
1 The report also notes that “the prospects of cyber-squatting within new gTLDs could force
parties to undertake defensive registrations.”

3 Data and Methodology
This paper aims to answer two basic questions: how do owners of biz domains use
their domains, and, if in active use, whether the biz domain forms the primary domain
of the registrant or whether it merely defends one registered under another gTLD. To
start, we obtained the biz and com zone ﬁles, dated June 27, 2011, to coincide with
the 10-year anniversary of the biz TLD’s addition to the authoritative root server. We
use three sets of domain names: all 2.1 million biz domains, their 2 million (94%) com
namesakes, and a random sample of 2 million com domains. We rely on four sources
of data to classify domains: zone ﬁles, active DNS queries, Whois registration records,
and Web content.
3.1 Zone Files
A zone ﬁle contains the DNS records used by a name server, typically in BIND format.
We obtained the zone ﬁles for the biz and com gTLDs from their respective registries.
We used the zone ﬁles to get the list of biz and com domains and determine which
domains were registered in both gTLDs. We also gathered their name server information
for the DNS crawler.
3.2 Whois
We retrieved the whois registration information for each biz–com pair in our data
set. Since whois records consist of free-form text, we use a customized version of
phpwhois2 to parse the whois records and extract the domain registrant (owner) infor-
mation. Many registrars have limits on the number of whois queries they will answer.
Additionally, phpwhois could not parse all whois entries. Due to these limitations, we
could only extract registrant information from 65% of our biz–com pairs.
In order to assess whether the biz domain and its com namesake share the same
owner, we compare the registrant information returned by phpwhois. We ﬁrst exclude
domains that use whois privacy mechanisms (e.g., the Domains by Proxy service). We
compute the Levenshtein distance between both domains for each of: the registrant’s
name, e-mail address, phone, and fax number. We mark each of these ﬁelds as missing
if they are absent or less than 5 characters long in either domain. We mark a ﬁeld as a
match if present and the Levenshtein distance between biz and com does not exceed
2 (requiring an exact match does not signiﬁcantly alter our results). We also mark reg-
istrant names as a match if the name from one domain forms a substring of the other
domain.
We consider two whois records a strong match if at least two of the four categories
match and at most one category is missing. We consider them a weak match if any of
the four categories match. We use both types of matches, but differentiate between them
in our analysis.
We note that for a signiﬁcant number of com domains, the whois record we retrieved
only contained the registrant name but no further ﬁelds. We therefore cannot have a
strong match for any of these domains.

3.3 DNS Probing
We queried the DNS records for a list of all biz domains and their com counterparts, as
well as the randomly selected set of com domains. For each name, we queried (starting
at the root) to ﬁnd the authoritative name servers for the biz and com versions of the
domain. We performed the crawling with a custom Python library on September 12th
and 13th, 2011.
3.4 Web Crawl
We collected the content of the web pages belonging to the registered domain in our
data sets. First, we downloaded the pages for the domains in the biz zone ﬁle, e.g.,
foo.biz. Then, we crawled the corresponding com domain foo.com to check the regis-
tration purpose for the biz domain. When downloading the web pages, we recorded the
HTTP status codes for success, redirection, errors and other standardized events. We
also recorded unknown errors. Note that at times we could not retrieve the Web pages,
either because the domains’ owners want to serve no Web content, or due to the time
interval (several months) between the zone ﬁle creation and our active Web crawling.
3.5 Content Classiﬁcation
To identify parked domains, we built a simple classiﬁer that searches for a set of regular
expressions in the downloaded content. We created highly speciﬁc patterns to match
templates for the largest known parking sites. We relied on unique features of the page,
such as JavaScript libraries or image servers used by the parked pages.
4 Analysis
Recall that we set out to evaluate a number of predictions made about the effects of in-
troducing a new gTLD: whether it would lead to “trademark holders simply duplicating
their existing domains” or “will allow different companies to have the same second-
level domain name in different TLDs”; whether it “would encourage pre-emptive and
speculative registrations based on the possibility of continued artiﬁcial scarcity” [10].
To answer these questions, we ﬁrst group biz domains into three functional categories:
Primary. Primary domains identify a company, product, service, or organization, either
publicly or internally. In other words, the registrant actually uses primary domains.
For example, NeuStar, Inc. and UC San Diego use neustar.biz and ucsd.edu,
respectively, as the primary domain names by which they identify themselves on the
Internet.
Defensive. A registrant uses a domain registration only to defend a name while not ac-
tively employing the domain to identify itself, its service, or network resources. Ex-
amples of defensive registrations are google.biz and gooogle.com, both of which
redirect to google.com.
Parked. Registrants park domains with the purpose of reselling them or generating ad-
vertising revenue from accidental user visits to the site.
