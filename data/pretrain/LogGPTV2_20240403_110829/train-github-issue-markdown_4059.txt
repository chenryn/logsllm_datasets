## Steps to Reproduce
If I create a new app with "flutter create myapp" and then try to launch it
either on Simulator or on my iPod Touch, then I have the following error:  
**error: The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock. Run 'pod install'
or update your CocoaPods installation.**
This is only resolved by performing a 'pod install' in the ios folder.
