Ok, this is a (relatively) simple one: when there's no hits for text in the
run bar, provide an option to web search. Of course, PowerToys should have
configuration for search engines and include at least Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing
and Yahoo. Or perhaps just provide an url input with replacement text, so I
could, for instance, configure:
    https://https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%q%
and have `%q%` replaced by my search text
