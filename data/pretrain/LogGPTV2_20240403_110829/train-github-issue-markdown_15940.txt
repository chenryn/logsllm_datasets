**Current behavior**  
Consider this template:
        ...
I have 2 inputs bound to the same FormControl.  
I'm not using `ngModel` input of `formControlName` directive.
When I enter something in one control, another control is not updated and
debugging shows that  
`viewModel` property of the second `FormControlName` is never updated.
I suppose this happens because `viewModel` is updated only when `ngModel` is
changed  
https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_directive.ts#L98  
and not when `control.valueChanges` fires.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Expected both inputs to always have the same value.
