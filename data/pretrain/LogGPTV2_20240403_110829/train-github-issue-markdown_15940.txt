### Current Behavior

In my template, I have two input fields that are bound to the same `FormControl`. I am not using the `ngModel` input with the `formControlName` directive. When I enter text in one of the input fields, the other input field does not update. Debugging reveals that the `viewModel` property of the second `FormControlName` is never updated.

I believe this issue occurs because the `viewModel` is only updated when `ngModel` changes, as seen in the following line of code:
```typescript
// https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/forms/src/directives/reactive_directives/form_control_directive.ts#L98
```
However, it is not updated when `control.valueChanges` fires.

### Expected Behavior

Both input fields should always display the same value.
