User: i have a py2app application, which runs an appscript using py-appscript. the Applescript code is this one line:
app('Finder').update(<file alias of a certain file>)
What this normally does is update a file's preview in Finder. It works most of the time, except for Leopard. In Leopard, everytime that script is executed, instead of updating the file, it starts a new instance of Finder. What am I doing wrong? The app was built on the same machine (the Leopard).
Assistant: Seeing as how py-appscript is a layer between python and the application you are scripting via Applescript, I would suggest porting the statement to pure Applescript and see if it works there. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with Applescript (and your statement alone) to begin with and it's not obvious what is the expected before with py-appscript when an error occurs.
