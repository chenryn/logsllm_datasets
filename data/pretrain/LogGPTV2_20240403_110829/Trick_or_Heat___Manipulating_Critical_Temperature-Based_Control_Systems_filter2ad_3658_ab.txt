IDSS is the drain current at zero gate-source voltage, and VP the
pinch-off voltage.
The analysis shows how the rectification effect in op-amps is
directly proportional to the square of the injected AC signal’s amp-
litude, independently by the type of transistor used [3].
In addition, instrumentation amplifiers are generally composed
by three op-amps, where the first two are arranged to buffer each
input to the third one. Wu et al. [84] demonstrated that the recti-
fication effect mainly happens at the non-inverting input of two
op-amps in the first stage of an in-amp. Furthermore, the resulting
DC offset at the in-amp output increases if the DC voltage differ-
ence between the inverting input and the non-inverting input of
the third op-amp becomes higher. Therefore, to reduce the rectific-
ation effect, external noise signals should be eliminated before the
amplifier input with proper filtering.
Our remote attack targets temperature-based control systems
lacking effective noise suppression circuits, tuning the transmitted
EMI signals to a carrier frequency equal to the resonant frequency
of the target circuit component to maximize the injected AC voltage
and induce the rectification effect.
3 THREAT MODEL
The goal of the adversary is to spoof the temperature sensor meas-
urement and manipulate a temperature control system to heat up or
cool down to an unsafe temperature. The adversary cannot tamper
with any hardware or software of the target system. Also, we don’t
consider a malicious human operator that could directly affect the
actual temperature around the sensor or deliberately operate the
victim system to manipulate the temperature setpoints of the sys-
tem.
Attack Scenarios. Adversaries could launch the attack from one
to several meters away, depending on their equipment and suscept-
ibility of the victim system. Furthermore, the malicious EMI signals
can penetrate many common physical barriers such as walls and
windows. For instance, the attack could be launched from outside
of a wall/window or from adjacent rooms. An adversary could also
use a hand-held attack device that can be carried and surreptitiously
operated under his/her clothes. Additionally, the adversary might
secretly leave or install a small remote control EMI emitting device
around the victim system in advance of the attack. During the at-
tack, two parameters (frequency and amplitude of EMI signal) need
to be adjusted.
Equipment. Adversaries could use commodity signal generators,
amplifiers and antennas to emit malicious EMI signals. Alternat-
ively, adversaries could purchase or make a customized small port-
able transmitter to conduct the attack; the device would be similar
to a hand-held radio transmitter (e.g., walkie-talkie) but with gain
control and a frequency range that covers the attack frequencies.
The power of EMI emitters that we use in experiments is below 4 W,
but more capable adversaries might use more specialized equipment
and techniques to improve the attack.

tion points of the experimental circuitry. We record the in-
duced DC voltage offset and the RMS voltage of AC signals
corresponding to different EMI frequencies.
Feedback. We assume that the adversary can observe the tem-
perature readings or heating/cooling indicator lights in the target
system, to ensure the induced attack effect. Alternatively, another
adversary or a monitoring device could help observe the feedback
of the victim system. However, the adversary does not have to
observe the victim system all the time; after the adversary ensures
the attack effect and selects suitable frequencies and amplitudes of
attack signals, observations will no longer be needed.
4 COMPROMISING TEMPERATURE SENSORS
In this section, we conduct detailed signal injection experiments
on typical temperature sensing circuits to study the attack effect.
We analyze the vulnerable circuit components and attack surface
with both DPI and remote EMI injection experiments.
4.1 Security Analysis
To explain how temperature sensors could be affected by recti-
fication attacks, we build an experimental temperature sensing
circuitry based on an NTC thermistor. We wire the thermistor in a
bridge circuit. Bridge circuits are commonly used in the wiring of
resistive sensors such as thermistors, RTDs and strain gauges [51].
The differential voltage generated by the bridge circuit is collec-
ted and amplified by a Texas Instruments (TI) LM1458 operational
amplifier. The details of the setup can be found in the Appendix
(Fig. 16).
Direct Power Injection (DPI) Experiments. It is difficult to meas-
ure and analyze the exact attack effect in circuits caused by remote
EMI radiations since the path and strength of the induced EMI
signals cannot be accurately predicted. Thus, we conduct DPI ex-
periments to identify and analyze how EMI can affect internal
components of temperature sensors.
In DPI, EMI signals can be injected directly into desired injection
points on the circuit through conductance. In this way, we can
control the power of the injected EMI signals more accurately and
avoid interference from unintentional EMI radiations on other parts
of the circuits. In our experiments, we connect the direct power
injection circuit to each of the possible signal injection points on
the sensing circuitry.
Figure 3: The relationship between the magnitude of the in-
duced DC voltage offset and the power of directly injected
EMI signals.
Inducing a Stabilized DC Voltage with Specific EMI Signals.
To achieve adversarial control over the sensor output instead of
general disruptions of the sensing system, we need to induce sta-
bilized DC voltage levels to control the sensor output rather than
fluctuating interference signals to disturb it. First, we find specific
EMI signals that can be rectified by the amplification circuits to
induce controllable voltage levels without causing strong noises.
We inject single-tone sine-wave EMI signals to each injection point
of the experimental circuitry and sweep the frequency from 10 MHz
to 1.5 GHz at an interval of 10 MHz with an injection power of
15 dBm, which is equivalent to 32 mW. As shown in Fig. 2, we re-
cord the induced DC voltage offset as well as the root mean square
(RMS) voltage of fluctuating alternating current (AC) signals in the
output of the amplifier. We observe that EMI signals at specific
frequencies induce a significant DC offset and the corresponding
AC interference signal is below the typical noise floor. Such fre-
quencies can be used in attacks to induce intentionally fabricated
signals that cannot be easily distinguished from legitimate sensor
measurements. Depending on the frequency of EMI signals, the
induced DC offset in the experimental circuitry could be either
positive or negative, allowing adversaries to increase or decrease
the temperature measurement maliciously.
Attack Surface. The identification of the attack surface helps to
understand possible attack mechanisms and facilitates the eval-
uation of sensor security in future system designs. As shown in
Fig. 2, our DPI experiments validate that a stabilized DC voltage
signal can be induced by EMI signals injected through different
entry points, including the sensor wire as well as other parts of the
circuitry such as shared power lines. As a result, adversaries could
exploit sensor wires, relatively long cables or printed circuit board
(PCB) traces to inject malicious EMI signals and induce the attack
effect. The potential attack surface also includes other compon-
ents in the system that are connected to the injection points of the
sensing circuitry. For instance, EMI signals conducted through the
charging port could affect a physically co-localized microphone in
a smartphone [50]. Similarly, devices, cables and other components
that are connected to possible injection points of the temperature
sensing circuitry could also make the sensor more susceptible to
attacks and need to be considered in the design of a system.
DC Voltage and EMI Power Relationship. Adversaries need to
control the magnitude of the induced DC voltage to gain effective
control over the sensor output. Theoretically, the magnitude of the
induced DC voltage offset is directly proportional to the power of

We conduct DPI experiments on the experimental circuitry and
inject EMI signals to each of the injection points to validate the
effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. We select the EMI frequen-
cies that correspond to peaks and troughs in Fig. 2 to affect the
output of the amplifier. As shown in Fig. 3, the power of directly
injected EMI signals is positively related to the magnitude of the
induced DC offset. The relationship can be considered as locally
proportional but presents a changing rate that gradually decreases
as the power of injected EMI signals grows.
For simplicity, we utilize the free space propagation model to
understand the relationship between the transmitting power (Pt )
and the injected power (Pr ) in remote attacks. From the Friis trans-
mission equation, we have
Pr = Gt Gr( λ
4π D )2Pt
(3)
Gt and Gr are the gains of the transmitting and receiving anten-
nas respectively. Gt depends on the type of antenna that is used by
the attacker. Note that components in the victim circuit work as
a receiving antenna. λ is the wavelength of EMI signals. D is the
attack distance between the adversary’s antenna and the victim
circuit. Based on Equations 2, 3, and our previous analysis, we can

mitting power of 3.08 W (right bottom).
infer that the magnitude of the induced DC voltage signal is loc-
ally proportional to the power of transmitting EMI, which will be
validated in our remote EMI injection experiments.
Spoofing the Temperature Sensor Output. We investigate re-
mote EMI injections that leverage the rectification effect in amplifi-
ers to gain adversarial control over the output of the temperature
sensing circuitry. As shown in Fig. 4, we transmit single-tone sine-
wave EMI signals and sweep the frequency from 300MHz to 1 GHz
at an interval of 10 MHz with a transmitting power of 36 dBm (equi-
valent to 4 W) and observe the induced DC voltage offset on the
oscilloscope. We find that the maximum and minimum DC voltage
offsets are induced at around 810 and 950 MHz respectively. We
then adjust the frequency of EMI signals with an interval of 1 MHz
to find the most effective frequencies that can be used in remote
attacks to maliciously increase or decrease the output voltage of
the circuitry. During the experiments, we shield the PCB with a
metal box and cover the probe of the oscilloscope with aluminum
shielding sleeves to mitigate unintentional interference. We aim
EMI signals to the sensor wire with a directional antenna [19] from
a horizontal distance of 0.2 m.
We demonstrate how adversaries can intentionally induce stabil-
ized voltage levels to control the output of the temperature sensing
circuitry by remote rectification attacks (Fig. 5). In the experiment,
we increase the output of the circuitry by using an attack frequency
of 807 MHz and decrease it with a frequency of 953 MHz. We manip-
ulate the magnitude of the injected DC voltage level by adjusting the
transmitting power between 0 and 2 W at an attack distance of 0.2
m. We monitor the real-time analog output of the circuitry with the
oscilloscope and record it with an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
that is connected to a laptop.
4.2 Off-The-Shelf Temperature Sensors
We investigate the attack effect on several off-the-shelf temperature
sensor circuits that use different amplifier breakout boards.
Thermocouple Sensors. We investigate the attack effects on both
shielded and unshielded K-type thermocouples that are connected
to a Sparkfun MAX31855K amplifier breakout board [9] with a
digital output interface, and an Adafruit AD8495 amplifier breakout
board [11] that has an analog output interface.

5 MANIPULATING TEMPERATURE-BASED
CONTROL SYSTEMS
Figure 8: Remote control of a K-type shielded thermocouple
at 1 m distance in two different scenarios: generating a step
function (left) and spelling of the word “HI" (right).
The length of the thermocouples we test is 1 m and we use an
Arduino board to sample the output of the Sparkfun MAX31855K
breakout board. As shown in Fig. 6, with an attack frequency of 589
MHz and an emitting power of 3.08 W, the attack can decrease the
temperature measurement of the unshielded thermocouple by about
56◦C or 909◦C from an attack distance of 3 m or 0.1 m respectively.
We also conduct the remote attack experiments on the Adafruit
AD8495 breakout board using a similar setting and summarize the
results in Fig. 7.
Spoofing Attacks on Thermocouples. Adversaries that have
capabilities to deliver EMI to a victim thermocouple sensor cir-
cuitry can remotely spoof the sensor output and inject arbitrary,
attacker-chosen temperature values. We remotely inject spoofed
temperature measurements to a K-type shielded thermocouple that
is connected to the MAX31855K amplifier with an attack distance
of 1 m and a transmitting power below 3.08 W. Our experiments
demonstrate the control over the temperature sensor output in two
different scenarios (Fig. 8). We use amplitude-modulated EMI sig-
nals to control the sensor measurements. We assume a sinusoidal
carrier signal c(t) = A(t) · sin(2π f t), where A is the amplitude of
the signal, t is the time, and f represents a frequency that induces
a DC voltage offset in the output of the victim circuitry. We vary
the amplitude A over time, according to the different scenarios.
Experiments with RTDs. We test both shielded and unshielded
PT100 RTDs connected to an Adafruit MAX31865 amplifier break-
out board [23] with remote EMI injection experiments. First, we
generate EMI signals with antennas and sweep the frequency from
10 MHz to 1.5 GHz but could not observe a stable temperature
change induced in the output of sensor. We then inject conducted
EMI signals directly into the terminals of the MAX31865 board
connected to the RTD and sweep through a wider frequency range.
As shown in Fig. 9, we find that EMI signals with lower frequen-
cies around 1 or 2 MHz can be more effective to manipulate the
temperature measurement.
In this section, we investigate the threats of the attack on real-world
temperature-based control systems that use different kinds of tem-
perature sensors, including NTC/PTC thermistors, thermocouples
and RTDs. We evaluate the attacks on systems that are employed in
medical applications such as an infant incubator, and in laboratory
equipment that control critical biological experiments or manufac-
turing processes. Additionally, we investigate several commodity
PID controllers equipped with temperature alarm functions.
We summarize the results of our attack experiments in Table 1.
We show that embedded systems based on different kinds of tem-
perature sensors employed in different application areas can be
affected by our attacks. Our results validate that temperature-based
