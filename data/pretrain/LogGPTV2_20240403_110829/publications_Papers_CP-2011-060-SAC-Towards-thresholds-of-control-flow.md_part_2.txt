Extracting thresholds for CFC measures has helped to establish
guidelines concerning the modeling of business processes in terms
of using decision nodes. With regard to OR-split type decision
nodes, the threshold value is 14, which means that business
process models are understandable if they contain no more than 3

5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this paper we have investigated threshold values for business
process measures and Cardoso’s Control-Flow complexity
measure. We have used the Bender method to extract threshold
values. Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to obtain
thresholds for the CFC measure by following the Bender method.
We obtained different threshold values for each experiment but
we believe that this may have been as a result of the experimental
subjects’ different theoretical and practical backgrounds. In this
case, all the subjects received the same introductory course to the
BPMN notation, but their background in other similar modeling
languages may have affected the results. Our findings reveal that a
Figure 2. Example model 1 business process model should have no more than 31 decision
nodes if an increased difficulty in understanding is to be avoided.
There should be about 22 xor decision nodes, which are those
most frequently used in BPMN models, while no more than 6 or
decision nodes and no more than 3 and decision nodes should be
used.
In future research we will enlarge the validation of these threshold
values by applying them in new experiments with human subjects
with different backgrounds and knowledge. Moreover, it would be
interesting to apply this method to other business process
measures in order to obtain a group of indicators, because
