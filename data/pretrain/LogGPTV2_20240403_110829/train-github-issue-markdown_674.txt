### Reproduction Link
        {{currencies[0] | currency}}
        {{currencies[1] | currency}}
        {{currencies[2] | currency}}
        {{currencies[0] | currency '&#8377;' 0}}
        {{currencies[1] | currency '&#8377;' 0}}
        {{currencies[2] | currency '&#8377;' 0}}
        {{currencies[0] | currency '&#8364;'}}
        {{currencies[1] | currency '&#8364;'}}
        {{currencies[2] | currency '&#8364;'}}
        {{currencies[0] | currency '&#8364;'}}
        {{currencies[1] | currency '&#8364;'}}
        {{currencies[2] | currency '&#8364;'}}
### Steps to reproduce
### What is Expected?
Indian numbering (as well as several other Asian countries) don't use the same
number separations as western countries. They place the first comma after
three digits, and the rest every two digits, so large numbers like currencies
become:
`₹1,00,000`
Instead of:
`₹100,000`
Further, many (but not all) European countries have a "decimal comma" and use
a dot to separate thousands groups, so the equivalent large amount would
become:
`€100.000,00`
I'm aware (from reading previous discussions on the `| currency` directive)
that inferring settings from the currency marker is not desired, but there
should be a way to specify the following outputs:
    $10.00
    $1,000.00
    $10,000,000.00
    ₹10
    ₹1,000
    ₹1,00,00,000
    €10.00
    €1,000.00
    €10,000,000.00
    €10,00
    €1.000,00
    €10.000.000,00
Note the two different euro variants.
### What is actually happening?
Currently, all the outputs are:
    $10.00
    $1,000.00
    $10,000,000.00
    ₹10
    ₹1,000
    ₹10,000,000
    €10.00
    €1,000.00
    €10,000,000.00
    €10.00
    €1,000.00
    €10,000,000.00
