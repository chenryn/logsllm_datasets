switching; Also, the difference between RA antenna modes
can reduce both the temporal correlation within a CSI
sequence and the spatial correlation between two CSI se-
quences; (2) Due to the ability of our channel randomization
approach to reduce both temporal and spatial correlation, it
is effective in defending against signal cancellation attacks.
Besides, due to the online nature of the signal cancellation
attack, different from previous works in protecting message
secrecy, the entropy of CSI in our approach does not need to
be very high; (3) Except for the correlation of wireless chan-
nel, the variance of CSI is also a key factor that could affect
the detection probability. More speciﬁcally, when the corre-
lation coefﬁcient is small, the variance of CSI dominates the
detection probability under signal cancellation attack, and
the other way around when the correlation coefﬁcient is big.
Therefore, for mode selection, there is a tradeoff between
mode diversity (which affects the randomness or correlation
of CSI sequences) and received signal strength (which is
determined by the magnitude of CSI); (4) By restricting
the attacker’s locations to bound its knowledge of the CSI,
multiple symbols can be calculated to guarantee a desired
integrity protection goal.
In the future, we will apply the design methodology in
this paper to defend against other types of attacks or en-
hance existing protection mechanisms in wireless systems,
such as friendly jamming. Also, we plan to extend our
defense framework to the case of MIMO.

Fig. 13: Detection probability under multiple CSI magnitude
threshold, the attack model here is type III attacker with
strategy 2 in experiment 1
to estimate h, it cannot implement M2, when evaluating the
performance of the attacker, only M1 should be considered.
The simulation results are shown in Fig. 13. We can see that:
1) when β is small, the detection probability under M2 is
smaller than that under M1, which means the CSI variation
becomes smaller after subtracting the average value. Thus,
for the subset of antenna modes, the radiation patterns are
somewhat similar and the LoS part can be approximated
with the average CSI. However, the difference between M1
and M2 reduces with the increase of β, that is, for the
left small number of antenna modes, the radiation patterns
becomes distinct and the average CSI cannot be regarded as
the LoS part; 2) when β = 0.05, rh¯g reaches the local max-
imum and becomes the main factor that leads to the local
minimum detection probability; 3) when 0.08 ≤ β ≤ 0.26,
no matter what rh¯g is, for M1 the detection probability stays
at the optimal value, which implies that the variance of CSI
dominates the detection probability and the attacker cannot
cancel any message; 4) when β ≥ 0.265, only one antenna
mode left, the RA regresses to DA, which results in stable
CSI, and in the ideal case, the attacker is able to cancel out
the message completely.
7 CONCLUSION
In this work, we studied the security of physical layer
message integrity protection scheme. We established a sig-
nal cancellation attack framework to model the attacker’s
behavior. Based on the analysis results of our strategy,
we proposed a physical layer message integrity protection
approach with reconﬁgurable antenna. Comprehensive ex-
periments were implemented to evaluate the security of our
proposed channel randomization approach under different
attack scenarios and extensive insights were observed from
our experimental results: (1) RA can randomize both LoS
component and NLoS component of CSI. The LoS part is
changed according to the antenna pattern switching and
directional gain of antenna mode, and the variation of
NLoS part is caused by both multipath and antenna pattern
