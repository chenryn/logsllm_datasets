I've a input element like `` which prompts a user to select a folder. I need
to get file names & paths of all the files within that folder.
    var input = document.getElementById('files');
    input.onchange = function(e) {
        var files = e.target.files; // File list
        for (var i = 0; i < files.length; ++i) {
          var fpath = files[i].webkitRelativePath;
          var ftype = files[i].type;
          var fsize = files[i].size;
          console.log(fname)
          }
        }
This works perfectly fine when run from chrome web browser as shown here:
https://jsfiddle.net/7prshjfz/. However, when I try to run the same app via
electron it gives ONLY the folder name and nothing else. When I tried to debug
further, I released that when a folder is selected, only the folder name,
size, modified etc details are available.
Therefore, clearly there is a different implementation of `webkitdirectory` in
electron. Is this an intended implementation?
**My Problem:** I know I can use the `dialog.showOpenDialog` and read the `fs`
using the directory path. But, I find this to be a bad solution for my case
(or perhaps for anyone) because, I want my code to be minimal for the sake of
the web app. I want to reuse as much of the functionality from the webapp with
additional implementation in Electron and NodeJS. I would be grateful to know
if there is any special implementation of webkitdirectory that works BOTH in
an Internet Browser and Electron app with minimal modifications, for instance,
to the above displayed code/ jsFiddle.
I'm not sure If I this is a missing feature/ bug or neither. Any feedback will
be appreciated :)
