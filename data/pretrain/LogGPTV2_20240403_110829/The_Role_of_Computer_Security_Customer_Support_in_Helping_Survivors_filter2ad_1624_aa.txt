Abstract
Technology plays an increasingly salient role in facilitating
intimate partner violence (IPV). Customer support at com-
puter security companies are receiving cases that involve
tech-enabled IPV but might not be well equipped to handle
these cases. To assess customer support’s existing practices
and identify areas for improvement, we conducted ﬁve fo-
cus groups with professionals who work with IPV survivors
(n=17). IPV professionals made numerous suggestions, such
as using trauma-informed language, avoiding promises to
solve problems, and making referrals to resources and support
organizations. To evaluate the practicality of these sugges-
tions, we conducted four focus groups with customer support
practitioners (n=11). Support practitioners expressed interest
in training agents for IPV cases, but mentioned challenges
in identifying potential survivors and frontline agents’ lim-
ited capacity to help. We conclude with recommendations for
computer security companies to better address tech-enabled
IPV through training support agents, tracking the prevalence
of these cases, and establishing partnerships with IPV advo-
cates.
1 Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV) — abuse or aggression that
occurs in a romantic relationship — is a pervasive societal phe-
nomenon that causes physical and psychological harms to vic-
tims [22]. In the United States, more than one in three women
and one in four men have experienced rape, physical violence,
and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime [35].
Research shows that technology plays an increasingly salient
role in IPV [28,53,70,85]. In particular, a growing number of
mobile apps enable abusers to surreptitiously spy on, harass
or impersonate their intimate partners [6, 10, 64, 79].
Providing technical support to survivors of technology-
enabled IPV is challenging. IPV professionals such as social
workers and lawyers report having insufﬁcient technical ex-
pertise [27]. Tools for detecting spyware and other malicious
apps still have a high false-negative rate [10]. Resources for
IPV professionals and survivors mostly include high-level
advice without standardized procedures for ﬂagging and ad-
dressing tech issues [27]. The Clinic to End Tech Abuse [77]
in New York City and the Technology-Enabled Coercive Con-
trol Clinic in Seattle are examples of personalized computer
security assistance to IPV survivors, but these services are
currently small and only available in speciﬁc locations [32].
We take a different perspective by focusing on customer
support agents at computer security companies for several rea-
sons. These agents are trained to troubleshoot tech issues, and
prior work shows that customers turn to them for a wide range
of security issues beyond products [67], making them a likely
point of contact for survivors experiencing tech-enabled IPV.
Computer security companies offer products that can help sur-
vivors by catching spyware or other malicious apps, meaning
that the tech help provided by support agents, when contacted
by survivors, can be timely and impactful. Additionally, sev-
eral large computer security companies have expressed inter-
est in supporting IPV survivors, forming the Coalition Against
Stalkerware [71]. However, helping IPV survivors through
customer support requires extreme care and caution. Inap-
propriate responses or recommendations might re-traumatize
survivors [50] or even escalate violence as abusers seek to
regain control [25, 27, 86].
We investigate the opportunities and challenges for com-
puter security customer support to help IPV survivors via
three steps:
1. To discover if customer support agents already encounter
IPV cases, we searched customer support cases at a large
computer security company. Our search surfaced at least
53 tech-enabled IPV cases, in which survivors described
the attacks’ severity and resulting distress. Support agents
typically focused on technical solutions without expressing
sufﬁcient empathy or awareness of IPV.
2. Having established that support agents encounter tech-
enabled IPV cases, we explore how customer support could
better serve IPV survivors by engaging 17 IPV profession-

als from ﬁve support organizations in focus groups. IPV
professionals provided numerous suggestions, such as us-
ing trauma-informed language, avoiding promises to solve
problems, and making referrals to external resources for
support beyond the immediate technical issue.
3. To gauge the practicality of IPV professionals’ recom-
mendations, we conducted focus groups with 11 customer
support practitioners from four large computer security
companies. Practitioners agreed on the importance of train-
ing agents for IPV cases but mentioned implementation
challenges, such as frontline agents’ limited capacity and
uncertainty in identifying whether a customer may need
IPV-related help.
Through this process, we thoroughly engaged with mul-
tiple stakeholders and synthesized their insights into novel
recommendations that both cater to the needs of IPV survivors
and consider the real-world constraints of customer support.
To better address tech-enabled IPV, we recommend that com-
puter security companies should train support agents to be
aware of IPV’s prevalence, the limitations of security software
in curbing IPV, and when and how to provide additional help.
Tracking the frequency and nature of relevant cases would
help companies assess their current practices and determine
areas to invest in. We further note the opportunity for com-
puter security companies and IPV advocates to learn from
each other’s expertise and join forces to help IPV survivors
combat tech-enabled abuse.
2 Background and Related Work
A growing body of literature on tech-enabled IPV has doc-
umented the many ways abusers maliciously use technol-
ogy [25, 28, 33, 45, 46, 48, 49, 70, 85] and how IPV survivors
struggle to protect their privacy and security [17, 18, 27, 53].
The complex socio-technical and legal factors embedded
in the intimate relationship differentiate tech-enabled IPV
from abuse in other contexts such as online harassment [74],
doxxing [69], cyberstalking [25], and cyberbullying [83].
Malicious apps in IPV. Tech-enabled IPV often occurs
through surveillance apps installed on survivors’ devices [10,
27, 31, 47, 53]. mSpy, one of the largest spyware vendors,
allegedly had around two million users as of 2014 [13]. In
NortonLifeLock’s 2020 survey, 10% of respondents admitted
using an app to monitor a former or current partner’s mes-
sages, calls, emails, or photos [78].
Most spyware apps are in fact dual-use, i.e., they have a
legitimate purpose (e.g., “Find My Phone” for anti-theft) but
can be repurposed for spying on an intimate partner [10].
Growing awareness of the spyware problem has led to im-
proved detection features and related research [11, 19, 24, 64].
Some security companies have joined forces with one another
and with IPV advocacy groups through the Coalition Against
Stalkerware [71]. Regulators are also strengthening their over-
sight on spyware, such as the US Federal Trade Commission’s
settlement with Retina-X in 2019 [72].
Interventions against tech-enabled IPV. In addition to spy-
ware detection tools, prior work has proposed apps and oper-
ating systems that can help IPV survivors by erasing browser
history [20, 73], recording evidence of abuse [3], or engaging
in safety planning [38]. However, few of them have received
wide adoptions among IPV survivors. Support organizations
such as NNEDV [76] and Safe Horizon [34] have provided
tech-focused resources for survivors, but these resources are
often out of date or lack detailed guidance [27]. Computer se-
curity clinics are a recent approach for helping IPV survivors
through one-on-one consultations with trained technologists,
who analyze survivors’ digital assets and provide personalized
advice on resisting tech-enabled attacks [26, 32, 80]. Despite
early evidence of success, these clinics are currently limited
to the serving geographic locations [32] and face numerous
challenges in remote operations [80]. Our focus — computer
security companies’ customer support — has the potential to
reach a broad audience, but this approach requires careful
attention to the nuances and unique risks in IPV to avoid
unintentional harm.
Customer Support. Customer support plays a crucial role
in helping customers make purchase decisions, providing
guidance on product use, and resolving problems or com-
plaints [7]. Reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy, and re-
sponsiveness (RATER) are key metrics in evaluating customer
support’s quality [61]. Support agents need to make customers
feel heard and respected to create a positive customer experi-
ence [5]. In particular, past research highlights the importance
of training support agents in information technology to use
phrases that build rapport and show empathy [84] since they
tend to be technical thinkers with limited soft skills. While
these principles may apply to most, if not all customers, inter-
acting with IPV survivors requires extra sensitivity and care,
as we discuss below.
Interacting with IPV survivors. Training materials for
IPV professionals note the impacts of violence on IPV
survivors, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and sub-
stance abuse, as well as the lengthy and challenging re-
covery process [4, 59]. Some materials further empha-
size empowerment — supporting survivors in ﬁnding their
inner strength [15, 41], and trauma-informed responses —
understanding the persistent effects of trauma and providing a
safe space [58, 59]. Others discuss secondary trauma on IPV
professionals and respective coping strategies, acknowledging
that bearing witness to abuse is emotionally taxing [59, 68].
However, most training for IPV professionals does not
cover tech-enabled abuse [27]. IPV professionals currently
do not have best practices for how to discover, assess, and
mitigate tech issues [27]. Meanwhile, support agents at com-
puter security companies provide complementary strength in

delivering tech-related assistance, but they may not be sen-
sitive to the nuances in IPV. By synthesizing perspectives
from IPV professionals and support practitioners, our work
identiﬁes how computer security customer support could help
IPV survivors and how this help should be provided.
3 Preliminary Analysis of Support Cases
As a starting point, we sought to discover if IPV survivors ex-
periencing tech-enabled abuse seek assistance from computer
security companies’ customer support and what those interac-
tions look like. We performed keyword searches on customer
support records from a large computer security company and
surfaced 53 cases in which the customer clearly identiﬁed
their attacker as an intimate partner. However, typical reac-
tions from support agents indicated they did not recognize the
complexity of IPV beyond tech issues.
3.1 Method
The company we worked with provides customer support
via phone, interactive chat, and self-service (e.g., FAQs, fo-
rums, and tutorials). We analyzed chat records since they are
anonymized, searchable, and represent a large portion (40%)
of support requests. All cases include customer-provided prob-
lem descriptions (255 characters maximum). Some cases also
include chat transcripts and agents’ notes.
To identify relevant cases, we searched a database of 18,900
customer support cases from January 2017 to May 2019. We
used search terms1 indicative of both abusive relationships
and IPV-related attacks drawn from prior work [25, 28, 85].
Our initial search surfaced 1,083 cases. After excluding those
irrelevant to our interest, such as users reporting generic mal-
ware or false positive warnings, we were left with 273 cases of
reported interpersonal attacks. Three researchers jointly coded
the customer-provided problem descriptions for these cases
to identify the attacker’s relationship to the victim (Fleiss’
κ=1.00). In 53 cases, the attacker was clearly identiﬁed as an
intimate partner (e.g., “my partner” or “my ex-boyfriend”).
The researchers also coded other attack-related dimensions
such as attack type (κ=0.75), attack mechanism (κ=0.59),2
and intimate partner relationship stage as deﬁned by Matthews
et al. [53] (κ=0.82).
We focused on analyzing the 53 cases that decisively indi-
cated tech-enabled IPV. Speciﬁcally, we summarized attack-
related details based on the customer’s problem description,
and thematically analyzed the agent-customer interaction

multiple attack mechanisms were frequently at play.
based on chat transcripts (if available). Note that other cases
in which the attacker’s identity was not speciﬁed (e.g., “I’m
being stalked”) may still be IPV-related. Additionally, our
analysis did not intend to measure the prevalence of IPV
cases within customer support data. Our results might not
reﬂect the actual prevalence given that the search terms might
have led to over-representation of spyware and ex-partners,
and customers might use non-identifying terms to describe
attackers who are intimate partners. Rather, the goal was to
know if such cases occur and qualitatively understand the
scenarios support agents are dealing with.
Ethical Considerations. Our study received IRB approval.
By agreeing to the company’s privacy policy, which is promi-
nently featured when a chat session starts, customers con-
sented to chat recordings and messages as examples of diag-
nostic information being shared with third parties. A company
employee reviewed all chat records to verify anonymity and
removed references to unique circumstances before providing
them to the research team.
3.2 Results
Diverse attack types. Among the 53 cases, the most com-
mon attack types were spying or surveillance of the survivor
(23), account or device compromise such as changing the ac-
count password to lock the survivor out (17), and interference
with account or device usage (12). Less frequently mentioned
attacks were harassment (5), spooﬁng (2), ﬁnancial fraud (2),
phishing (2), and content modiﬁcation on the survivor’s ac-
count or device (2). Installing spyware or other malicious
apps on the survivor’s device was the primary attack mecha-
nism (23), though account compromise based on knowledge
of credentials (10) and physical ownership-based attacks (6)
also occurred. These attack types and mechanisms generally
align with Freed et al.’s taxonomy [28].
Attacks’ repercussions on survivors. In 49 of the 53 cases,
the survivor reported being in the process of separation or
had separated from their abuser. Though the survivor’s risks
might appear lower for attacks after separation, feelings of
anxiety and concern were common, with references to vio-
lence, ruined lives, and even contemplation of suicide.
In 13 cases, the survivor mentioned multiple types of at-
