## Abstract
Technology is increasingly being used to facilitate intimate partner violence (IPV). Customer support at computer security companies often encounter cases involving tech-enabled IPV but may lack the necessary training to handle these cases effectively. To assess current practices and identify areas for improvement, we conducted five focus groups with professionals who work with IPV survivors (n=17). These professionals suggested using trauma-informed language, avoiding promises to solve problems, and making referrals to resources and support organizations. To evaluate the practicality of these suggestions, we conducted four focus groups with customer support practitioners (n=11). Support practitioners expressed interest in training agents for IPV cases but highlighted challenges in identifying potential survivors and frontline agents' limited capacity to help. We conclude with recommendations for computer security companies to better address tech-enabled IPV through training support agents, tracking the prevalence of these cases, and establishing partnerships with IPV advocates.

## 1. Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV) — abuse or aggression that occurs in a romantic relationship — is a pervasive societal issue causing physical and psychological harm to victims. In the United States, more than one in three women and one in four men have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Technology plays an increasingly significant role in IPV, with mobile apps enabling abusers to spy on, harass, or impersonate their partners.

Providing technical support to survivors of technology-enabled IPV is challenging. IPV professionals such as social workers and lawyers often lack the necessary technical expertise. Detection tools for spyware and other malicious apps have high false-negative rates, and resources for IPV professionals and survivors often provide high-level advice without standardized procedures. Personalized computer security assistance, such as the Clinic to End Tech Abuse in New York City and the Technology-Enabled Coercive Control Clinic in Seattle, are available but limited in scope.

We focus on customer support agents at computer security companies because they are trained to troubleshoot tech issues and are likely points of contact for survivors experiencing tech-enabled IPV. These companies offer products that can help detect and mitigate spyware, making their support timely and impactful. However, helping IPV survivors requires extreme care and caution to avoid re-traumatizing them or escalating violence.

Our investigation involves three steps:
1. Analyzing customer support cases to determine if support agents already encounter IPV cases.
2. Conducting focus groups with IPV professionals to gather suggestions for improving support.
3. Conducting focus groups with customer support practitioners to gauge the practicality of these suggestions.

## 2. Background and Related Work
### 2.1. Tech-Enabled IPV
A growing body of literature documents how abusers use technology to perpetrate IPV, including surveillance, harassment, and impersonation. This differs from other forms of online abuse due to the complex socio-technical and legal factors involved in intimate relationships.

#### 2.1.1. Malicious Apps in IPV
Tech-enabled IPV often involves surveillance apps installed on survivors' devices. Spyware vendors like mSpy have a large user base, and many dual-use apps can be repurposed for spying. Improved detection features and research have led to better tools, and some security companies have joined forces with IPV advocacy groups through the Coalition Against Stalkerware.

#### 2.1.2. Interventions against Tech-Enabled IPV
Proposed interventions include apps and operating systems that help survivors erase browser history, record evidence of abuse, or engage in safety planning. However, few have been widely adopted. Support organizations provide tech-focused resources, but these are often outdated or lack detailed guidance. Computer security clinics offer personalized advice but face geographic and operational challenges.

### 2.2. Customer Support
Customer support is crucial for helping customers make purchase decisions, providing product guidance, and resolving issues. Key metrics for evaluating support quality include reliability, assurance, tangibility, empathy, and responsiveness. Training support agents to use empathetic language is essential, especially when interacting with IPV survivors.

### 2.3. Interacting with IPV Survivors
Training materials for IPV professionals emphasize the impacts of violence, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse, and the importance of empowerment and trauma-informed responses. However, most training does not cover tech-enabled abuse. By synthesizing perspectives from IPV professionals and support practitioners, our work identifies how computer security customer support can help IPV survivors.

## 3. Preliminary Analysis of Support Cases
To determine if IPV survivors seek assistance from computer security companies and what these interactions look like, we analyzed customer support records from a large company. We identified 53 cases where the attacker was clearly an intimate partner, but typical reactions from support agents indicated a lack of recognition of the complexity of IPV beyond tech issues.

### 3.1. Method
The company provides customer support via phone, interactive chat, and self-service. We analyzed chat records, which are anonymized, searchable, and represent 40% of support requests. We searched a database of 18,900 customer support cases from January 2017 to May 2019 using keywords indicative of abusive relationships and IPV-related attacks. Our initial search surfaced 1,083 cases, and after excluding irrelevant ones, we were left with 273 cases of reported interpersonal attacks. Three researchers coded the problem descriptions to identify the attacker's relationship to the victim, attack type, mechanism, and relationship stage.

### 3.2. Results
Among the 53 cases, the most common attack types were spying or surveillance (23), account or device compromise (17), and interference with account or device usage (12). Less frequent attacks included harassment, spoofing, financial fraud, phishing, and content modification. Installing spyware or other malicious apps was the primary attack mechanism. In 49 of the 53 cases, the survivor was in the process of separation or had separated from their abuser, and feelings of anxiety and concern were common.

In 13 cases, the survivor mentioned multiple types of attacks, highlighting the multifaceted nature of tech-enabled IPV. Ethical considerations were addressed, and IRB approval was obtained. Chat records were reviewed to ensure anonymity and remove unique identifiers before analysis.

## 4. Conclusion
Our study highlights the need for computer security companies to better address tech-enabled IPV. We recommend training support agents to recognize the prevalence of IPV, understand the limitations of security software, and provide appropriate additional help. Tracking the frequency and nature of relevant cases will help companies assess their practices and determine areas for investment. Additionally, partnerships between computer security companies and IPV advocates can leverage each other's expertise to better support survivors.
