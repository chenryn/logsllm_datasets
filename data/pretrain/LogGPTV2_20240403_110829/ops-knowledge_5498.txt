User: The project I'm doing requires a server. But, with Bottle I can create only a localhost server. I want to be able to access it anywhere. What do I use? I know about pythonanywhere.com, but I'm not sure as to how to go about it.
Assistant: On PythonAnywhere, all you need to do is:

Sign up for an account, and log in.
Go to the "Web" tab
Click the "Add a new web app" button
Select "Bottle"
Select the Python version you want to use
Specify where you want your code files to be

...and then you'll have a bottle server up and running on the Internet, with simple "Hello world" code behind it.  You can then change that to do whatever you want.
