**Current behavior**  
There is no way to trigger a navigation while preventing a pushState event
**Expected/desired behavior**  
There should by a way of preventing the pushState event, maybe using the
NavigationExtras:
    this.router.navigate(['/myRoute', {id= id}], {preventPushState: true});
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
I have a route that listen for its fragment parameters. When they are not
present, I setup default values and trigger a navigation so that the url is
updated correctly. There is no way for the user to go back since it will
always be redirected from [route without param]->[route with param]. I would
like to update the url without pushing an history state.
