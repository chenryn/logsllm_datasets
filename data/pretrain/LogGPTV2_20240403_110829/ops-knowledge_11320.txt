Assistant: Set up a test cron:


  */5 * * * *  echo "test" >
  /tmp/crontest.txt


This will write "test" to the file /tmp/crontest.txt every 5 minutes

Ensure the cron daemon crond is running using


  [andy@server]# ps aux | grep cron
  
  root      4321  0.0  0.0  76543  3211
  ?        Ss   Jul31   0:07 crond


Check the logs using 


  tail /var/log/cron


Try date to ensure you are in the correct timezone
