Some classes don't expose a plublic setter for internal list (as an example,
commons-configuration CompositeConfiguration) bue some addXXX(item) method.
As suggested in http://forum.springframework.org/viewtopic.php?t=3617  
a beanPostProcessor can be used to setup a bean from a List using iterative
call to the add method.
