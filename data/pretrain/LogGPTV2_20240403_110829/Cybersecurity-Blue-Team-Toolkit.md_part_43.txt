[]{#f04.xhtml#ffirs03-sec-0001}
When my 7‐year‐old introduced me to his second‐grade class, he put it
best: "My mom teaches the good guys how to keep the bad guys out of
their computers. She has a blue light saber."
I have been in the technology industry for more than 20 years in a
variety of positions from marketing to training to web development to
hardware. I have worked in academia as an IT director of a private
elementary/middle school and as a technology instructor teaching
post‐graduate classes at Louisiana State University. I have trained and
consulted in the corporate world for Fortune 50 companies and have
hands‐on experience working and training the U.S. Department of Defense,
focusing on advanced cybersecurity and certifications. Currently, I am
Lead Education Technical Specialist at Rapid7, managing the curriculum
and teaching classes in Nexpose, InsightVM, Metasploit, Ruby, SQL, and
API.
I love what I do---as an author, a trainer, and an engineer---making the
world safer one domain at a time.
