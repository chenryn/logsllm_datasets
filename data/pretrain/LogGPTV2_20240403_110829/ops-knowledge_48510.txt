User: I have a simple script I wrote, and when trying to run it (F5) , I get this msg:

================== RESTART: C:\Users\***\Desktop\tst.py ==================

I restarted the shell, reopened the script, but still, the same msg appears.
I use python 3.5.1 and I tried to simplify the script as much as possible, but I still get this result. Now my script is only one line with a simple print(1) command and I still get this msg.
Was there something wrong with the shell installation?

That's the hotkey for IDLE to run a file. It is not ordering to do anything. It's a log statement to explicitly declare that your namespace is being cleared and the file is going to be ran fresh again. 

no, I didn't tell it to restart

But you did... You pressed F5
