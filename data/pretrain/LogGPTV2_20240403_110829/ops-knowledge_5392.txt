User: We need to add Memcached as a cache layer on the existing system. Please provide a reasonable and feasible solution.
Assistant: The following is a reasonable and feasible solution: 1. First, you need to determine the requirements, such as which data types and data volumes to store, etc. According to the requirements, select one or more Memcached nodes to meet the requirements. It is recommended to deploy Memcached nodes on different physical servers to improve reliability and performance. 2. Modify the cache layer and data access layer in the original system as needed to cooperate with Memcached. The specific modification method can vary according to the system architecture and code implementation. However, it should be noted that the correctness and compatibility of the modification must be guaranteed to avoid affecting the original system. 3. Add an access interface to Memcached in the code, so that the application can directly use Memcached as the cache layer. 4. Regularly monitor and optimize the usage efficiency and performance of Memcached, such as regularly clearing expired data, reasonably setting cache expiration time, increasing cache capacity, etc. 5. Ensure the stable operation and security of Memcached, such as encrypted transmission, prevention of Dos attacks, backup and disaster recovery and other measures. 6. Finally test and verify the usability, performance and stability of the system. If necessary, load testing, stress testing, and failure recovery testing can be performed.
