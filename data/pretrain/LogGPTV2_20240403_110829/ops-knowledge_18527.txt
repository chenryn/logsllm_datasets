User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题I want the bash script to echo only if I execute and not echo if executed by a cron job I want to echo to the terminal if the script is being executed by me, in the flesh or I want to echo to a log file if it is being done via a cron job.

Ubuntu 16.04

example:

#!/bin/bash

if [ ***** ]; then
   echo "You executed this script just now !";
else
   echo "You were executed by the server cron at ${date}" &gt;&gt; example.log
fi


I rewrote the above because I thought it would be a simpler way to explain it. It's a more direct and cleaner example.

Assistant: Try this :

if [[ -t 0 ]]; then
    echo "executed from terminal"
elif [[ $(&lt; /proc/$PPID/comm) == cron* ]]; then
    echo "executed by cron"
else
    echo "executed outside of a terminal"
fi
