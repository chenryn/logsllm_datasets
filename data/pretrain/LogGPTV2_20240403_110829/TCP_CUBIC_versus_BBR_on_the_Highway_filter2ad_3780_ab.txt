### 5.3 Round-Trip Time

Two methods were employed to measure the round-trip time (RTT) between the smartphone and our servers: (i) the average of three ICMP pings conducted before each trial, and (ii) the TCP connection setup time measured through the three-way handshake.

Figure 7 compares the cumulative distributions of RTTs measured by ICMP pings and TCP three-way handshakes for all trials. As shown in Figure 7, the RTTs measured by both methods generally fall within the same range, with the majority of the distribution between 40 to 80 ms. This suggests that the TCP three-way handshake can effectively estimate window sizes for congestion control [13]. The ping RTTs exhibit more fine-grained variations over time, possibly due to timers on the end systems. Some high RTTs exceeding 100 ms in the tail of the distributions can cause CCA timeouts and complicate RTT-based bandwidth estimation [4]. Our results are consistent with metropolitan LTE measurements by Huang et al. [5], which observed median RTTs of 70 ms, but also noted RTTs over 400 ms.

### 5.4 Throughput and SINR

Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) is a key performance metric for cellular networks [7], significantly affecting modulation selection (see Section 4) and, potentially, TCP throughput.

Figure 8 compares the TCP throughputs (y-axis) for different SINRs (x-axis), clustered into 5 dB bins. The measured throughputs for each CCA across all trials are shown using boxplots. The figure indicates a strong correlation between throughput and SINR. BBR achieves slightly higher throughput than either CUBIC CCA only at SINRs between 20–25 dB. For all other SINRs, the throughputs of the three CCAs are comparable.

### 5.5 Throughput and Handovers

During data transfer while in motion, a User Equipment (UE) may be handed over from one LTE tower to another for two reasons: (i) the current serving eNodeB assumes the UE is leaving its serving zone, or (ii) the UE discovers another eNodeB with better radio conditions (i.e., stronger SINR).

While 3GPP standards [1] state that packets can be forwarded to the next serving eNodeB during tower handover to avoid service interruptions, packet loss can still occur, especially during rapid movement (e.g., highway driving), which can confuse bottleneck link capacity estimation algorithms (e.g., used in BBR [4]).

Figure 9 shows the distributions of the number of serving and detected cell towers for all TCP downloads. Despite mobility at driving speeds, only 35% of the TCP downloads experienced one or more handovers, and less than 4% had two or more handovers. Although handovers can affect TCP performance, their impact on web traffic (usually < 1 MB) or even streaming traffic (segment size ∼ 4 MB) is likely insignificant due to the low probability of handovers during short flows. Our handover numbers are consistent with Xiao et al.'s [12] report of average handovers every 25 seconds at top speeds (300 kph) and every 250 seconds at our driving speeds (100 kph). A more detailed analysis of the impact of handovers on TCP performance is left for future work.

### 5.6 Self-Infllicted Delay

Traditionally, TCP increases data rates until it saturates the bottleneck queue. While this can maximize throughput, it also increases the minimum RTT (see Figure 7) — i.e., it introduces a "self-infllicted" delay. We calculate self-infllicted delays as the average time between sending a data packet and receiving the response ACK (excluding duplicate ACKs) minus the initial TCP handshake.

Figures 11(a) and (b) depict the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of the self-infllicted delays. For the full 20 MB download, the minimum self-infllicted delays are similar for all distributions, but the bulk of the BBR distribution is much lower than either CUBIC. For the 1 MB download, BBR has a slightly higher median delay (50 ms versus 25 ms), but CUBIC has a heavier tail (e.g., a much higher maximum), particularly for k3.19.

### 5.7 Retransmission

Duplicate ACKs impact RTT measurements (which are not updated for duplicate ACKs [9]) and retransmissions (which occur with three duplicate ACKs).

Figure 12 shows the distribution of duplicate ACKs (x-axis), calculated as the number of duplicate ACKs over total ACKs, and Figure 13 shows the distribution of retransmission percentages (x-axis). BBR has significantly fewer duplicate ACKs than either version of CUBIC, which should further aid BBR's RTT measurements. Additionally, BBR has significantly fewer retransmissions, leading to improved radio efficiency.

### 5.8 Summary

Figures 14(a) and (b) summarize the results of the three CCAs under highway driving conditions. Each CCA is represented by a single point, corresponding to the average throughput (y-axis) and RTT (x-axis) across all trials, with error bars (vertical and horizontal) showing 95% confidence intervals on the means.

For the full downloads (Figure 14(a)), BBR has higher average throughput than either version of CUBIC, but the overlapping confidence intervals mean the difference is not statistically significant. However, the lower self-infllicted delay for BBR is about one-third that of CUBIC and is statistically significant. For the first MB (Figure 14(b)), BBR has higher throughputs than CUBIC, but also higher self-infllicted delays (about 50% higher in both cases).

### 6 Conclusions

This paper presents the first comprehensive measurement study comparing TCP CUBIC (x2) and BBR under highway driving conditions over LTE. During an 800-mile (1350 km) drive, a mobile phone downloaded 700 + 20 MB files on a tier-1 U.S. wireless carrier’s network, recording physical, IP, and transport layer data. Performance metrics include throughput, round-trip time, and retransmissions, correlated with LTE SINR and modulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing BBR "in the wild" and the first published analysis of LTE characteristics while driving using a U.S. wireless network.

The analysis shows that driving conditions cover a range of SINRs, some of which yield throughputs near 40 Mbps, but with relatively few tower handoffs despite the speeds. For 20 MB downloads, CUBIC and BBR perform comparably in terms of throughput, but BBR has significantly lower average self-infllicted delays and experiences significantly fewer duplicate ACKs. For 1 MB downloads, BBR has higher throughput but also higher self-infllicted delays.

Since large buffers can lead to "bufferbloat" and degrade TCP performance, algorithms that limit queue occupancy (measured by self-infllicted delays) can be effective for LTE networks. However, buffering allows flows to take advantage of small-scale variation in LTE capacity, suggesting tuning congestion control algorithms to keep buffers appropriately filled. The data from this study should be helpful for future models and simulations of LTE networks, particularly for mobile environments.
