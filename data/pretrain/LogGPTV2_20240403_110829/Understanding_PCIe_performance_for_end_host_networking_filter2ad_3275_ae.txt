with different architectures, e.g., AMD, ARM64, and Power
based servers, would provide further interesting insights into
PCIe implementations. Furthermore, we have not yet studied
the impact of multiple high performance PCIe devices in the
same server, a common configuration in datacenters. Such a
study would reveal further insights into the implementation
of IOMMUs (e.g., are IO-TLB entries shared between devices)
and potentially unearth further bottlenecks in the PCIe root
complex implementation.

As for more generic studies about PCIe, there has been
little micro-benchmark work beyond Miller et al. [41] who
describes an approach to measure PCI and first generation
PCIe interconnect latency through a differential analysis of
transaction delays. Moll et al. [42] demonstrated the use of
FPGA based hardware for profiling software applications
including an analysis of PCI bus performance, while Endo
et al. [10] demonstrate the importance of latency in interac-
tive and transactional application software. In addition, they
introduced a new set of micro-benchmarks to assess the per-
formance against latency and encourage further, application-
specific study of PCI interconnect latency impact.
Surveying specialist cases of PCIe, Lostrie et al. [36] present
a setup for benchmarking the performance of the full PCIe-
communication path between two FPGA-boards with mi-
croTCA. While, Koop et al. [27] evaluate InfiniBand on a
PCIe 2.0 system. The authors study the benefits of PCIe 2.0
on both DDR and QDR data rates on the Mellanox Con-
nectX and also investigate the general trend of additional
interconnect bandwidth upon application-performance on
multi-core machines. Earlier still, Liu et al. [35] evaluate the
third generation InfiniBand HCAs from Mellanox, which
supports PCIe interfaces. They compare the performance
of these with HCAs using PCI-X interfaces. The evaluation
consists of a set of micro-benchmarks at the interconnect
level, including latency, bandwidth, and bidirectional band-
width experiments. They show that InfiniBand HCAs with
PCIe interfaces deliver excellent performance. However, the
methodology is only superficially similar to our own with a
focus firmly on InfiniBand performance.
Finally, Braithwaite [4] and Li et al. [33] investigate I/O
bandwidth in NUMA architectures. The former presents a
method for analyzing main memory and PCIe data-access
