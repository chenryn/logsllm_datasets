User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题how to connect to server continuously using an bad internet connetion I have a bad Internet connection, it disconnects frequently and on reconnect, I'm assigned a different IP address by the ISP.

The problem is that I connect to a remote VPS (Ubuntu), and when Internet connection is disrupted n reconnected, I can no longer do anything on the terminal. I have to restart the terminal and re-initiate the connection.

Is there a way I can have persistent connection with server.

Assistant: Use "screen" as soon as you log into the Ubuntu server.
