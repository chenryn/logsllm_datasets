User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Using SSH Keys with Kerberos So there's an issue that we've been having at our company causing me to pull my hair out for the past week:

We have hundreds of server boxes (a mix of CentOS6/7, if it matters) that need to quickly be SSHed into on a daily basis between a team. Everyone is using mRemoteNG or SuperPutty as the ability to save and organize connection info as well as tabbed connections are a must have. Presently everyone is sharing a single SSH key to log into all boxes. Obviously our current practice is a terrible idea, so what we'd like to do is give each user an individual account and key to be used across the boxes.

Looking around, it seemed that Kerberos is a perfect option for managing multiple users and handling authentication across a la
rge amount of servers. Unfortunately we seem to be having some issues in getting it to work the way we want. We were able to set up Kerberos to handle SSH connections for users with passwords, but when it came to disabling passwords and using SSH keys, we couldn't figure it out.

We looked into using Kerberos keytabs as well, howevever we could not get them to work via PuTTY or find a viable solution to save connection info and have tabbed connections with keytabs.

The main question here is: Can Kerberos be used to manage SSH users with SSH keys? If not, is there a build of PuTTY available that works with Kerberos keytabs, or an alternative that can organize and have tabbed connections? Thanks!

Assistant: PuTTY 0.61 or newer can use Kerberos/GSSAPI tickets (instead of public-key authentication) to authenticate to an SSH server. To enable this, go in PuTTY's configuration menu to "Connection | SSH | Auth | GSSAPI" and make sure "Attempt GSSAPI authentication" is enabled. (The Linux OpenSSH client equivalent is "ssh -K".)

There are two ways in which PuTTY can obtain the required Kerberos ticket-granting ticket:


PuTTY has access to any ticket that Windows obtained from its Active Directory domain server when you logged into a Windows machine that is in a domain. In that case, there is no need to do anything special to get a ticket.
Alternatively (e.g. on a Windows machine not in a domain), PuTTY also has access to any tickets that you got by running the "MIT Kerberos Ticket Manager" GUI tool that comes with the "MIT Kerberos for Windows" package  from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/). Just use that to obtain your Kerberos ticket before you start PuTTY. If "MIT Kerberos Ticket Manager" is running, it will prompt you automatically for your Kerberos password if PuTTY needs one. It is therefore a good idea to add a shortcut to "MIT Kerberos Ticket Manager" to your Startup folder.


On the sshd server side:


Obtain from your KDC and install in /etc/krb5.keytab a server keytab.
In /etc/ssh/sshd_config make sure you have GSSAPIAuthentication yes to enable Kerberos authentication.


Make sure that krb5.conf is set up correctly on both sides, such that the GSSAPI libraries used by putty and sshd both find the same realm and contact the same KDC (unless your realm and KCD are already properly advertised via DNS, in which case nothing needs to be added to krb5.conf).
