User: How to successfully deal with sudden high concurrent requests by building a highly scalable system?
Assistant: To build a highly scalable system, the following aspects can be considered: 1. Vertical expansion and horizontal expansion Vertical expansion refers to improving the performance of the system by increasing the processing capacity of a single node. This can be achieved by increasing hardware resources such as CPU and memory. However, there are problems such as hardware limitations and high cost in vertical expansion. Therefore, in scenarios that need to handle a large number of concurrent requests, it is more common to expand horizontally, that is, to increase the number of nodes to spread the load. This can be achieved through load balancing, clustering, etc. 2. Database read and write separation The database is one of the bottlenecks of system performance. In order to deal with sudden high concurrent requests, you can consider separating read and write, that is, read and write operations are processed by different database instances. This can avoid read-write conflicts and improve the concurrency of the database. 3. Caching technology Caching technology can greatly reduce the system's access to the database and improve system performance. When dealing with sudden high-concurrency requests, hotspot data can be cached in memory to reduce access to the database. 4. Asynchronous processing For some operations that can be processed asynchronously, they can be placed in the message queue to avoid blocking the system. Asynchronous processing can greatly improve the concurrency capability of the system. 5. Current limiting and fusing In order to ensure the stability of the system, current limiting and fusing strategies can be set. When the system reaches a certain load, current limiting measures can be used to prevent requests from continuing to increase, and a fuse mechanism can be set to avoid system crashes. The above aspects are the basic elements for building a highly scalable system. In order to deal with sudden high concurrent requests, it is necessary to work hard on these aspects and continuously optimize and improve the system architecture and code implementation.
