User: I'm not a great coder, in fact I'm just trying to learn, but I can't get Geany to regonise Python in my system (Windows 7) when I try to execute the program. When I click Execute, it opens a command prompt saying:

'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file

How can I fix this?
Assistant: I had the same problem and found that setting the path as described in the other prior posts was necessary but not sufficient.  In my case, I had saved my script to the "geany" directory.  It turns out that there was a permissions problem with the geany editor trying to create a temporary file in the geany folder.  As soon as I saved my script to another folder the permissions error went away.
