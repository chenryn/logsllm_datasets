It would be beneficial to have an optional parameter on the facet, similar to the "ignore_unmapped" parameter used in sorting.

**Context:**
We utilize "dynamic_templates" in our index mapping, allowing clients to search, filter, sort, and facet on any field that is valid according to the mapping rules. The issue arises when facets are applied to fields that do not exist in the data, and thus are not actually present in the mapping.

**Example:**
With a "dynamic_template" for "rating-*" fields, we can perform searches, filtering, and sorting (with "ignore_unmapped" set to true) on a "rating-Tuna" field, even if no documents in the index contain that field.

For a quick demonstration of the problem, please see the following Gist: [https://gist.github.com/4568689](https://gist.github.com/4568689).
