An optional parameter on the facet, like sort's "ignore_unmapped" parameter
would be great.
Context : We use "dynamic_templates" in our index mapping and allow clients to
search, sort, and "facet" on any field that is valid by the rules of the
mapping.
The problem arises when facets are run on fields that do not exist in the
data, and thus are not "actually" in the mapping.
Example : With a "dynamic_template" for "rating-*" fields, we can search,
filter, and sort  
(with "ignore_unmapped" = true), against a "rating-Tuna" field, even though
there are no  
documents in the index with that field.
See Gist https://gist.github.com/4568689 for a script that will quickly
demonstrate the problem.
