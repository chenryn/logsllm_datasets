Airflow 1.10.9  
Celery 4.3.0
Setting Celery 'worker_concurrency' is overriden by the autoscaling no matter
what you configure.
Problematic code is here:
airflow/airflow/cli/commands/celery_command.py
Line 121 in 6db66ea
|  'autoscale': autoscale,  
---|---  
(this is head but it's the same bug in the 1.10.x version of this file)
You always get the default autoscaling setting with head if you don't set
autoscaling at all but do set worker concurrency (which is 12 workers).
Not adding "autoscale" to the dictionary when autoscaling is not set is enough
to solve this (at least, I tested the worker_concurrency half of things, and
the asked for concurrency is back with that change).
