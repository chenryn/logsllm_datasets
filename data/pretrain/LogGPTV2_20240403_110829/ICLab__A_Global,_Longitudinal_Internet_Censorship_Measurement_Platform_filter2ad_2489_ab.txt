we have observed identical block pages from both, indicating
that all types of ASes are subject to similar blocking policies
in those countries.
User-hosted VPNs (e.g., Geosurf [42], Hola [47], Lumi-
nati [55]) would offer access to residential ISPs, but ICLab does
not use them, as they have all the ethical concerns associated
with VODs, with less transparency. Also, there are reports of
illicit actions by the operators of these VPNs, such as deploying
their software as a viral payload, and facilitating distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks [58], making it even more
unethical to use these services.
Since commercial VPNs’ advertised server locations cannot
be relied on [85], we validate their locations using round-trip
time measurements (see Appendix B for details), and we only
use the servers whose locations are accurately advertised.
Volunteer-operated device vantages. VODs are more difficult
to keep running, and require a local volunteer comfortable
with the risks associated with operating the device. Since
ICLab does not collect personally identifiable information
about the volunteers, our IRB has determined that this project
is not human subjects research. However, we are guided by
the principles of ethical human subjects research, particularly
the need to balance potential benefits of the research against
risks undertaken by volunteers. Most of our VODs have been
deployed opportunistically through collaborations with NGOs
and organizations interested in measuring Internet censorship
from a policy perspective. For each deployed VOD, we maintain
contact with the volunteer, and monitor the political situation
in the country of deployment. We have deemed some countries
too risky (for now) to recruit volunteers in (e.g., Iran, Syria).
Breadth of coverage. As of this writing, ICLab has VPN-
based vantage points in 55 countries, and volunteer-operated
clients in 13 countries. 6 countries host both types of clients,
so ICLab has vantage points in 62 countries overall. ICLab
seeks to achieve both geographic and political diversity in its
coverage. Table I summarizes our current geographic diversity
by continent, and political diversity by a combination of two

scores of political freedom, developed by Freedom House [39]
and Reporters Without Borders [68] (see Appendix C).
It is easier to acquire access to vantage points in Europe,
North America, and East Asia than in many other parts of
the world. We have plans for expanded coverage in Africa and
South America in the near future, via additional VPN services.
It is also easier to acquire access to vantage points in “free” and
“partially free” than “not free” countries, because it is often
too risky for either VPN services or volunteer-operated devices
to operate in “not free” countries. Expanding our coverage
of “not free” countries is a priority for future development of
ICLab, provided we can do it safely.
Internet censorship does happen in the “partly free” and
“free” countries, and is not nearly as well documented as
it is for specific “not free” countries (most notably China).
Our broad coverage of these classes of countries gives us the
ability to track changes over time, across the full spectrum of
censorship policy, worldwide.
C. Test Lists
At present, ICLab’s measurements are focused on network-
level interference with access to websites. ICLab’s vantage
points test connectivity to the websites on three lists: the Alexa
global top 500 websites (ATL) [5], the websites identified as
globally sensitive by the Citizen Lab [22] and the Berkman
Klein Center [11]3 (CLBL-G), and, for each country, the
websites identified as locally sensitive in that country by Citizen
Lab and Berkman Klein (CLBL-C). We only use the global
top 500 sites from Alexa’s ranking, because its “long tail” is
unstable [54], [71]. All test lists are updated weekly.
ICLab has tested a total of 47,000 unique URLs over the
course of its operation. Because all of the vantage points
test ATL and CLBL-G, there is more aggregated data for
these sites: 40% of our data is from sites on ATL, 40% from
sites on CLBL-G, and 20% from sites on CLBL-C. Individual
vantage points test anywhere from 3,000 to 5,700 URLs per
measurement cycle, depending on the size of CLBL-C for the
vantage point’s country. This is by no means the complete set
of sites blocked in any one country [28], and we have plans to
broaden our testing, as described further in Section IX.

independent but have substantial overlap, so we combine them.
countries and 234 ASes. We publish our data for use by other
researchers,4 with periodic updates as we continue operation.
E. Control Nodes
Many tests of censorship rely on comparison of measure-
ments between the vantage point and a “control” location,
where there is not anticipated to be censorship. We repeat
all the measurements performed by our vantage points on a
control node located in an academic network in the USA. This
network allows access to all the sites we test for accessibility.
The control node has also suffered outages. In this paper, we
use public data sets compiled by other researchers to fill in the
gaps, as described in Section IV. We have since deployed three
more control nodes in Europe, Asia and the USA to improve
reliability and geographic diversity.
IV. Censorship Detection
Next, we describe how ICLab detects manipulated DNS
responses (§IV-A), packets injected into TCP streams (§IV-B)
and HTML-based block pages (§IV-C). All of ICLab’s detection
algorithms are designed to minimize both false negatives, in
which a censored site is not detected, and false positives, in
which ordinary site or network outages, or DNS load balancing
are misidentified as censorship [32], [43], [48], [82].
A. DNS Manipulation
To access a website, the browser first resolves its IP address
with a DNS query. To detect DNS manipulation, ICLab records
the DNS responses for each measurement, and compares them
with responses to matching DNS queries from our control node,
and with DNS responses observed by control nodes OONI [37]
operates. ICLab applies the following heuristics, in order, to
the observations from the vantage point and the control nodes.
Vantage point receives two responses with different ASes.
If a vantage point receives two responses to a DNS query, both
with globally routable addresses, but belonging to two different
ASes, we label the measurement as DNS manipulation. This
heuristic detects on-path censors who inject a packet carrying
false addresses [8]. Requiring the ASes to differ avoids false
positives caused by a DNS load balancer picking a different
address from its pool upon retransmission.
Vantage point receives NXDOMAIN or non-routable ad-
dress.
If a vantage point receives either a “no such host” re-
sponse to a query (NXDOMAIN, in DNS protocol terms [13]),
or an address that is not globally routable (e.g., 10.x.y.z) [12],
but the control nodes consistently receive a globally routable
address (not necessarily the same one) for the domain name,
over a period of seven days centered on the day of the vantage
point’s observation, we label the test as DNS manipulation.
The requirement for consistency over seven days is to avoid
false positives on sites that have been shut down, during the
period where a stale address may still exist in DNS caches.
Vantage point receives addresses from the same AS as
control nodes.
If a vantage point receives a globally routable

measurements per week.
D. Data Collection
A measurement of a URL is an attempt to perform an HTTP
GET request to that URL, recording information about the
results from multiple layers of the network stack: (1) The
complete DNS request and response or responses for the server
hostname (using both a local resolver and a public DNS
resolver). (2) Whether or not a TCP connection succeeded.
(3) For HTTPS URLs, the certificate chain transmitted by the
server. (4) The full HTTP response (both headers and body).
(5) A traceroute to the server. (6) A comprehensive packet trace
for the duration of the measurement. This allows us to identify
anomalies that would not be apparent from application-layer
information alone. For instance, when packets are injected by
on-path censors, we can observe both the injected packets and
the legitimate responses they conflict with (see Section IV-B).
Each vantage point measures connectivity to all of the sites
on its test list at least once every three days, on a schedule
controlled by the central server. Depending on the size of the
test list, a cycle of measurements typically runs for 1–2 hours.
Figure 2 depicts ICLab’s measurements over time in each
country. Operating ICLab over a multi-year period has not
been easy; several outages are visible in Figure 2. For instance,
we lost access to our vantage points in Iran in May 2017 due
to a change in the international sanctions imposed on Iran,
and we suffered a year-long, multi-country outage due to one
VPN provider making configuration changes without notice.
The latter incident led us to improve our internal monitoring
and our tracking of VPN configuration changes.

ducted 53,906,532 measurements of 45,565 URLs in 62

address, and the control nodes also receive globally routable
addresses assigned to the same AS (not necessarily the
exact same address), we label the measurement as not DNS
manipulation. Variation within a single AS is likely to be due
to load-balancing over a server pool in a single location.
Vantage point and control nodes receive addresses in
different ASes. The most difficult case to classify is when the
vantage point and the control nodes receive globally routable
addresses assigned to different ASes. This can happen when
DNS manipulation is used to redirect traffic to a specific server
(e.g., to display a block page). However, it can also happen
when a content provider or CDN directs traffic to data centers
near the client [66].
We distinguish censors from CDNs using the observation
that censors tend to map many blocked websites onto just a
few addresses [9], [43]. If a set of websites resolve to a single
IP address from the vantage point, but resolve to IPs in more
than θ ASes from the control nodes, we count those websites as
experiencing DNS manipulation. θ is a tunable parameter which
we choose by cross-checking whether these measurements also
observed either a block page or no HTTP response at all.
Taking this cross-check as ground truth, Figure 3 shows how
the false positive rate for DNS manipulation varies with θ. For
the results in Section V, we use a conservative θ = 11 which
gives a false positive rate on the order of 10−4.
B. TCP Packet Injection
Censors may also allow DNS lookup to complete normally,
but then inject packets that disrupt the TCP handshake or
subsequent traffic. ICLab detects this form of censorship by
recording packet traces of all TCP connections during each
test, and analyzing them for (1) evidence of packet injection,
and (2) evidence of intent to censor (e.g., block page content
or TCP reset flags in injected packets). By requiring both types
of evidence, we minimize false positives. Short error messages
delivered by the legitimate server will not appear to be injected,
and packets that, for innocuous reasons, appear to be injected,
will not display an intent to censor.
Evidence of packet injection. If an end host receives two TCP
packets with valid checksums and the same sequence number
but different payloads, the operating system will generally
accept the first packet to arrive, and discard the second [67].
An on-path censor can therefore suppress the server’s HTTP
response by injecting a packet carrying its own HTTP response
(or simply an RST or FIN), timed to arrive first. Because ICLab
records packet traces, it records both packets and detects a

tions.
conflict. This is not infallible proof of packet injection; it can
also occur for innocuous reasons, such as HTTP load balancers
that do not send exactly the same packet when they retransmit.
Intent to censor: RST, FIN, or block page. When we detect
a pair of conflicting packets, we inspect them for evidence
of intent to censor. An injected packet can disrupt/censor
communication by carrying a TCP reset (RST) or close (FIN)
flag, causing the client to abort the connection and report a
generic error [24], [82]; or it can carry an HTTP response
declaring the site to be censored (a “block page,” discussed
further in Section IV-C), which will be rendered instead of the
true contents of the page the client requested [26], [48].
As with DNS manipulation, we compare each observation
from a vantage point that shows evidence of packet injection,
with matching observations from a control node. We apply the
following heuristics, in order, to pairs of observations. The
various outcomes of these heuristics are shown in Figure 4.
No matching control observation. When a TCP stream from
the vantage point shows evidence of packet injection, but does
not seem to correspond to any observation taken by the control
node, we abandon any attempt to classify it. This is the “No
record for URL” row of Figure 4.
This filtering is necessary because of a limitation in our
packet trace analyzer. When a website transfers all of its traffic
to another domain name, either via a CNAME record in DNS
or using HTTP redirects, the trace analyzer cannot tell that TCP
connections to the second domain name are associated with an
attempt to test the first domain name. We conservatively do
not consider these cases as censorship.
Packet collision after handshake, with RST or FIN. When a
TCP stream from the vantage point shows evidence of collisions
in TCP sequence numbers after successful completion of the
three-way handshake, one side of the collision has its RST
or FIN bit set and the other side has neither bit set, we label
the measurement as censored by packet injection, regardless
of what the control node observed. This is the “connection
disrupted” column of Figure 4. We have high confidence that
all of these are true positives.
