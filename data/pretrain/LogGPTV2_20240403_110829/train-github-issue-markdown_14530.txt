Currently we print multiple exception stacks on a test failure. It will be
good to
  * Print only the first exception from a failing test only
  * In the event of multiple exceptions from different testsets, print all of them only if an env variable is set. Default is to print only one.
  * Don't print known exceptions raised in the testsystem machinery
  * Limit stacktrace to last 30 lines?
