After installing Ubuntu 10.10 and Python 2.5.5, I encountered an issue where IDLE would not start from the terminal. To troubleshoot, I opened the Python interpreter and attempted to import the `_tkinter` module, but it was not found. After some research, I discovered that `_tkinter` might not be included in Ubuntu/Debian distributions by default. As a result, I executed `sudo apt-get install python-tk` to install the necessary package.

However, even after this installation, the interpreter still cannot find the `_tkinter` module. What steps should I take next?

**Solution:**
You can use the Synaptic Package Manager to search for and install the required packages. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Open the Synaptic Package Manager:
   - Go to **System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager**.
   
2. In the Synaptic Package Manager, search for "idle" and install any related packages that may be missing.

This should resolve the issue with the `_tkinter` module and allow IDLE to start correctly.
