User: Installed Ubuntu 10.10 and Python 2.5.5.  IDLE did not start from the terminal so I went into the Python interpreter and did "import _tkinter".  The package was not found.  After searching a bit, I found that Ubuntu/debian might not include _tkinter so I proceeded to "sudo apt-get install python-tk" as per my searches.
Still the interpreter cannot find _tkinter.  What next?
Assistant: Use Synaptic Package Manager (System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager).  Search for "idle".
