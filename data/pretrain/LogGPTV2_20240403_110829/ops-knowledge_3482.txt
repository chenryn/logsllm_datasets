User: I have a python script that I would like to add a "Shutdown when done" feature to.
I know I can use gksudo (when the user clicks on "shutdown when done") to ask the user for root privileges but how can I use those privileges at a later time (when the script is actually finished).
I have thought about chmod u+s on the shutdown command so I don't need a password but I really don't want to do that.
Any ideas how I can achieve this?
Thanks in advance,
Ashy.
Assistant: Escalate priority, spawn (fork (2)) a separate process that will wait (2), and drop priority in the main process.
