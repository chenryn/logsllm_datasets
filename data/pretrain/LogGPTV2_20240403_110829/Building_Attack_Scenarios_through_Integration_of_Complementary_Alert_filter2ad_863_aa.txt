Abstract
Several alert correlation methods were proposed in the
past several years to construct high-level attack scenarios
from low-level intrusion alerts reported by intrusion de-
tection systems (IDSs). These correlation methods have
different strengths and limitations; none of them clearly
dominate the others. However, all of these methods de-
pend heavily on the underlying IDSs, and perform poorly
when the IDSs miss critical attacks. In order to improve
the performance of intrusion alert correlation and reduce
the impact of missed attacks, this paper presents a se-
ries of techniques to integrate two complementary types
of alert correlation methods: (1) those based on the sim-
ilarity between alert attributes, and (2) those based on
prerequisites and consequences of attacks. In particular,
this paper presents techniques to hypothesize and reason
about attacks possibly missed by IDSs based on the indi-
rect causal relationship between intrusion alerts and the
constraints they must satisfy. This paper also discusses
additional techniques to validate the hypothesized attacks
through raw audit data and to consolidate the hypothe-
sized attacks to generate concise attack scenarios. The ex-
perimental results in this paper demonstrate the potential
of these techniques in building high-level attack scenarios
and reasoning about possibly missed attacks.
1. Introduction
It is well-known that current intrusion detection systems
(IDSs) produce large numbers of alerts, including both ac-
tual and false alerts. The high volume and the low qual-

ity of intrusion alerts (i.e., missed attacks and false alerts)
make it a very challenging task for human users or intru-
sion response systems to understand the alerts and take
appropriate actions. Thus, it is usually necessary to con-
struct high-level attack scenarios from a large collection
of low-level intrusion alerts.
Several alert correlation techniques have been proposed
to facilitate the analysis of intrusion alerts, including ap-
proaches based on the similarity between alert attributes
[4, 7, 25, 27], previously known (or partially known) at-
tack scenarios [8, 9], and prerequisites and consequences
of known attacks [5, 19]. A common requirement of these
approaches is that they all depend on underlying IDSs for
alerts. This means the results of alert correlation are lim-
ited to the abilities of the IDSs. In particular, if the IDSs
miss critical attacks, the results of alert correlation will not
reﬂect the true attack scenario, and thus provide mislead-
ing information.
In this paper, we develop a series of techniques to con-
struct high-level attack scenarios even if the IDSs miss
critical attacks. Our approach is to integrate complemen-
tary intrusion alert correlation methods and use the intrin-
sic relationships between possibly related attacks to hy-
pothesize and reason about attacks missed by the IDSs.
We are particularly interested in two types of alert cor-
relation methods: correlation based on prerequisites and
consequences of attacks [5,19] (which we call causal cor-
relation methods, since they are intended to discover the
causal relationships between alerts), and correlation based
on similarity between alert attribute values [4, 7, 25, 27]
(which we call clustering correlation method). Because
these two methods correlate alerts using different mecha-
nisms, combining them can potentially lead to better cor-
relation results. Our main contribution in this paper is a
series of techniques to integrate the causal and the clus-
tering correlation methods, and to use the results to hy-
pothesize and reason about attacks possibly missed by the
IDSs. These techniques are critical to constructing high-
1
level attack scenarios from low-level intrusion alerts in sit-
uations where the IDSs cannot guarantee to detect all at-
tacks. These techniques complement the underlying IDSs
by hypothesizing and reasoning about missed attacks, and
thus can provide valuable additional evidences to support
further intrusion investigation and response.
Our approach starts with a straightforward combina-
tion of the causal and the clustering correlation methods.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst correlate the same set of intrusion
alerts with both methods independently, then combine re-
sults from the causal correlation method (represented as
correlation graphs) using results from the clustering cor-
relation method. For example, if the clustering correlation
method decides that two alerts in two separate correlation
graphs are very similar (e.g., same target, close times-
tamps, etc.), we combine these two correlation graphs into
one. We then develop techniques to hypothesize about at-
tacks possibly missed by the IDSs, especially unknown
variations of known attacks.
We observe that if two attacks are causally related
through some intermediate attacks, they usually satisfy
certain conditions (e.g., sharing the same destination IP
address), even if they are not directly adjacent in a se-
quence of attacks. The attribute values of the correspond-
ing alerts should also satisfy such conditions. This obser-
vation provides another opportunity to reason about the
hypothesized attacks by inferring their attribute values.
Moreover, the hypothesized attacks can be further vali-
dated through raw audit data. For example, we might hy-
pothesize that variations of IMAP Authen Overflow
and/or RPC Cmsd Overflow were missed by the IDSs.
However, if during the target time frame, there is only
IMAP trafﬁc and no RPC trafﬁc to the target host, we
can easily conclude that the latter hypothesis is impossi-
ble. Finally, to improve the usability of the constructed
attack scenarios, we present a technique to consolidate the
hypothesized attacks and generate concise representations
of the high-level attack scenarios.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
The next section brieﬂy describes a speciﬁc causal cor-
relation method, on the basis of which our techniques
are developed. Section 3 presents our techniques to inte-
grate clustering and causal correlation methods, including
approaches to hypothesizing and reasoning about attacks
possibly missed by IDSs, methods to validate hypothe-
sized attacks using raw audit data, and ways to consolidate
hypothesized attacks. Section 4 reports our experimental
results to test the effectiveness of our techniques. Section
5 discusses related work, and Section 6 concludes this pa-
per and points out some future research directions. The
Appendix gives more information about the alert types
used in our experiments.
2. Previous Work: Alert Correlation Using
Prerequisites of Attacks
The new techniques in this paper are built on the basis
of the causal correlation method proposed in [19], which
we brieﬂy describe below.
The approach in [19] correlates intrusion alerts using
the prerequisites and consequences of attacks. Intuitively,
the prerequisite of an attack is the necessary condition for
the attack to be successful. For example, the existence of
a vulnerable service is the prerequisite of a remote buffer
overﬂow attack against the service. The consequence of
an attack is the possible outcome of the attack. For exam-
ple, gaining local access as root from a remote machine
may be the consequence of a ftp buffer overﬂow attack.
In a series of attacks where earlier ones are launched to
prepare for later ones, there are usually connections be-
tween the consequences of the earlier attacks and the pre-
requisites of the later ones. Accordingly, we identify the
prerequisites (e.g., existence of vulnerable services) and
the consequences (e.g., discovery of vulnerable services)
of attacks, and correlate detected attacks (i.e., alerts) by
matching the consequences of previous alerts to the pre-
requisites of later ones.
The correlation method uses logical formulas, which
are logical combinations of predicates, to represent the
prerequisites and consequences of attacks. For example,
a scanning attack may discover UDP services vulnerable
to certain buffer overﬂow attacks. Then the predicate UD-
PVulnerableToBOF (VictimIP, VictimPort) may be used to
represent this discovery.
The correlation model formally represents the prereq-
uisites and consequences of known attacks as hyper-alert
types. A hyper-alert type is a triple (fact, prerequisite,
consequence), where fact is a set of alert attribute names,
prerequisite is a logical formula whose free variables are
all in fact, and consequence is a set of logical formu-
las such that all the free variables in consequence are in
fact. Intuitively, a hyper-alert type encodes the knowledge
about the corresponding type of attacks. Given a hyper-
alert type T = (fact, prerequisite, consequence), a type T
hyper-alert h is a ﬁnite set of tuples on fact, where each
tuple is associated with an interval-based timestamp [be-
gin time, end time]. The hyper-alert h implies that prereq-
uisite must evaluate to True and all the logical formulas in
consequence might evaluate to True for each of the tuples.
The correlation process is used to identify prepare-
for relations between hyper-alerts.
Intuitively, this re-
lation exists if an earlier hyper-alert contributes to the
prerequisite of a later one.
In the formal model,
correlations are identiﬁed via prerequisite and conse-
quence sets. Given a hyper-alert type T = (fact, pre-
requisite, consequence), the prerequisite set (or conse-
quence set) of T , denoted P rereq(T ) (or Conseq(T )),

is the set of all predicates that appear in prerequisite
(or consequence). The expanded consequence set of
is the set of all predi-
T , denoted ExpConseq(T ),
cates that are implied by Conseq(T ).
(This is com-
puted using the implication relationships between pred-
icates [19].) Thus, Conseq(T ) ⊆ ExpConseq(T ).
Given a type T hyper-alert h, the prerequisite set, con-
sequence set, and expanded consequence set of h, de-
noted P rereq(h), Conseq(h), and ExpConseq(h)), re-
spectively, are the predicates in P rereq(T ), Conseq(T ),
and ExpConseq(T ) with arguments replaced by the cor-
responding attribute values of each tuple in h. Each el-
ement in P rereq(h), Conseq(h), or ExpConseq(h) is
associated with the timestamp of the corresponding tuple
in h. Hyper-alert h1 prepares for hyper-alert h2 if there
exist p ∈ P rereq(h2) and c ∈ ExpConseq(h1) such that
p = c and c.end time  h.end time, h may indirectly
prepare for h0 if T ype(h) may indirectly prepare for
T ype(h0) w.r.t. T . Given a sequence of hyper-alerts h,
h1, ..., hk, h0 where k > 0, h indirectlypreparesfor h0 if
h preparesforh1, hi preparesforhi+1 for i = 1, ..., k −1,
and hk preparesfor h0.
Intuitively, h mayindirectlyprepareforh0 if there could
exist a path from h to h0 in a correlation graph (with ad-
ditional hyper-alerts), while h indirectlypreparesfor h0 if
such hyper-alerts do exist. We are particularly interested
in the case where h mayindirectlyprepareforh0 but there
do not exist additional hyper-alerts showing that h indi-
rectlypreparesforh0. Indeed, a possible reason for such a
situation is that the IDSs miss some critical attacks, which,
if detected, would lead to additional hyper-alerts showing
