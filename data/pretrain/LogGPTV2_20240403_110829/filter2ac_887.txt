**ATT&CK Technique Name:** User Account Management

To enhance security, it is essential to ensure that user accounts with administrative rights adhere to best practices. These practices include:

- **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs):** Use dedicated, highly secured workstations for administrative tasks to minimize the risk of compromise.
- **Just in Time/Just Enough Administration (JIT/JEA):** Implement JIT and JEA to grant administrative privileges only when necessary and for the minimum required duration.
- **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to verify the identity of administrators.

Additionally, reduce the number of users who are members of highly privileged directory roles to minimize the potential attack surface.
