Kansas has purchased two Communications on Wheels 
(COW) vehicles.  The vehicles are equipped with extendable 
antennas, an ACU 1000 and approximately 25 handheld units 
to be distributed to first responders following natural disasters 
or terrorist attack.  The COWs were purchased with the State’s 
20% share of the FY2003 funds for $546,000.  The COWs 
have been used frequently in training and actual events including an Ice Storm in which 
the COWs replaced a destroyed communications tower.    
• Kansas is pursuing a Statewide interoperable communications system.  The State has 
provided 5 million in G&T funds to develop an 800MHZ system in the Southeast portion 
of the State.  This phase of the project is expected to be completed by the end of June 
2006.  The second phase of the project will begin in July 2006 and will result in a large 
portion of the State being covered by the 800 MHZ system.  Communities which will not 
be covered by the 800 
MHZ system will be 
connected to the 
interoperable 
communications system 
through ACU1000’s and 
similar devices which 
will allow multiple 
agencies with diverse 
frequencies to 
communicate on 
common channels.  The

• FY 2004:  $3.5 million for Louisville’s MetroSafe Project. 
• FY 2004:  $4 million for wireless communications infrastructure. 
• FY 2005:  $2.5 million for mobile data terminals.   
• Summary:  The two primary interoperability projects underway in 
the Commonwealth are Louisville’s MetroSafe Project and the statewide mobile date 
terminal project for law enforcement, fire, and EMS.  MetroSafe is a joint operation to 
consolidate communications for 911, the Louisville Metro Police Department, Louisville 
Fire and Rescue, Local Government Radio, and Louisville Metro Emergency Medical 
Services.  In addition, MetroSafe will offer interoperability for all remaining 911 PSAPS, 
Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, suburban city agencies within Louisville Metro as well 
as the 13 surrounding counties in Kentucky and Indiana.  The MetroSafe project is 
responsible for acquiring a facility; developing and implementing adequate infrastructure 
to support voice, wireless and data communications; implementing proper security; and 
acquiring and implementing public safety applications to support consolidated 
communications and public safety interoperability. 
• 
The Commonwealth has 
also developed a 
statewide interoperable 
mobile data terminal 
project they are 
implementing for law 
enforcement.  The 
project will be expanded 
to fire and EMS agencies 
and will be compatible 
with the MetroSafe 
project in Louisville.

Current Interoperable Communications Initiatives 
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita confirmed the need for a single network, multiple 
zone redundant architecture with an expanded capacity to provide reliable and 
survivable communications to the Louisiana emergency response community.  
To achieve this, Louisiana has pursued the following initiatives: 
Louisiana is installing an integrated communications platform by shared use 
of 700MHz and 800MHz wireless communications.  This system will provide 
layers of redundancy and increased capacity to the current communications capability of the state 
network.  Redundant communications paths are being secured, thereby ensuring operability and 
survivability.  These measures will provide for greater interoperability among the State's 
emergency response community, further augmented by implementing bridging capabilities 
among local networks and the state network.  And, it will provide a system which permits 
communications support for responders from other jurisdictions when in a disaster area.  The 
focus will first be on coastal parishes of Louisiana reaching up to the I-10/I-12 corridor. 
Immediately following landfall 
of Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana 
officials met with FEMA in an 
effort to coordinate the 
emergency implementation of 
the 700 MHz communications 
network.  In response, FEMA 
issued a purchase order to 
Motorola for $15.9 million to 
repair and augment the current 
infrastructure in the effected 
area.  This included the

construction and upgrade of 19 communications tower sites in southeast Louisiana.  Currently, 
16 of these sites are fully operational, with work and funding still pending on the remainder.  The 
project consists of an Astro25 700MHz, 19 site, Project 25 compliant network providing 
interoperable voice communications for sixteen parishes.  Additionally, FEMA has funded a $5 
million purchase of mobile and portable radios for St. Bernard and Plaquemines Parishes which 
will utilize the State's 700 MHz communications system. 
The UASI Region 1 (New Orleans metro area), utilizing DHS/COPS grant funding, has issued a 
$16 million contract with Motorola for the acquisition of an APCO Project 25 compliant dual 
mode 700/800 MHz digital trunked system, which will become a zone within the single system 
multi-zone Statewide 700 MHz system.  This architecture will provide seamless, interoperable 
roaming with the entire State system.  Additionally, the Louisiana legislature appropriated $2.8 
million to the Louisiana State Police to remediate nine additional sites in southwest Louisiana. 
To establish levels of interoperability between disparate communications systems, Louisiana 
State Police has purchased eight (two are portable) ACU1000 devices to aid in the state's 
interoperability endeavor.  These devices have been installed at the LSP Troops located in 
Shreveport, New Orleans, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Grey and Covington and will allow multiple 
agencies to communicate with each other on a common channel.

• FY 2004:  $1.3 million to purchase 3 statewide mobile command vehicles 
and 6 smaller mobile command vehicles to be placed strategically around 
the state to enable first responders to quickly establish command, control, 
and interoperability at the scene of an incident. 
• FY 2005:  $5.5 million sub-granted to locals to purchase interoperable 
communications equipment. 
• Summary:  Maine is implementing CON-OPS as a foundation and standard for statewide 
interoperability planning (Frequency standards).  Radios are being purchased for all 49 
hospitals to ensure statewide interoperability with first responders.  The Maine Radio 
Network Board is 
awaiting a final report on 
a statewide 
interoperability study to 
consolidate 5 separate 
network systems into a 
single statewide system.
