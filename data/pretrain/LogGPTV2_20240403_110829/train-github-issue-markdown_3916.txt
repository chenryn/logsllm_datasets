tsc -v 1.7.5  
When compiling for es6 target, with let, const, etc., and using commonjs
module, browser (Chrome) complains about let and co. used outside of "strict
mode" zone. Adding "use strict" at the beginning of commonjs module should fix
this.
Note:
  * spec for es6, 10.2.1 Strict Mode Code says that "Module code is always strict mode code". This assumes that es6 modules are used, while commonjs' require()'s look differently.
  * it does not seem to be a problem with node, as it probably relaxes this rule.
  * Babel's transform-es2015-modules-commonjs inserts "use strict" at the start of the file, satisfying browser's desire to stick to the standard's rule, and it all just works. Unfortunately, this requires a babel step in the build :(
