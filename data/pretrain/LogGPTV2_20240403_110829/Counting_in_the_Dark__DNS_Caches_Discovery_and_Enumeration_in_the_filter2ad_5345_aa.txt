## Abstract
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental component of the Internet, providing lookup services for end users and various applications, systems, and security mechanisms. DNS caches are critical for improving efficiency and reducing latency and traffic. Understanding the behavior, configurations, and topologies of these caches is essential for enhancing the security and performance of Internet users and services.

In this work, we present methodologies for efficiently discovering and enumerating DNS caches in resolution platforms. We apply our techniques to study popular DNS resolution platforms, including those operated by major ISPs, enterprises, and open DNS resolvers. Our findings provide insights into the architectures and configurations of DNS caches.

## 1. Introduction
The Domain Name System (DNS), as defined in [RFC1034, RFC1035], plays a crucial role in the Internet, ensuring the correctness and availability of domain name translations. Initially designed to map domain names to IP addresses, DNS has evolved to support a wide range of applications and is a key building block in scalable network architectures. The complexity of the DNS infrastructure has led to significant research and operational efforts to understand its inner workings and security.

This paper focuses on DNS caches, which store previously requested records to reduce traffic and improve performance. Our goal is to understand the topologies and configurations of these caches, particularly the relationship between IP addresses used for client communication and the DNS nameservers, and the caches they use. This understanding is vital for enhancing the security and performance of the Internet.

### 1.1 Motivation for Studying Caches
Understanding the DNS infrastructure is critical for improving its security and designing mechanisms that depend on it. For example, knowing the number of caches in a DNS platform is necessary to evaluate vulnerabilities to cache poisoning attacks. We explain the motivation for studying caches and provide examples in Section II.

### 1.2 Methodology
Our methodology involves triggering specially crafted DNS requests to infer information about the caches hidden behind the IP addresses of the tested DNS platforms. By analyzing the DNS request/response behavior, we can decouple the caches from the IP addresses and count the number of caches and their mappings.

### 1.3 Contributions
- **Conceptual Contribution:** Our study improves the current understanding of DNS resolution platforms and serves as a foundation for further research on DNS performance and security.
- **Practical Contribution:** Our tools and measurements can be used to enhance the security, efficiency, and consistency of DNS, and to design mechanisms that utilize the DNS infrastructure.

### 1.4 DNS Resolution Platforms
We consider a general model for DNS resolution platforms, which typically include ingress IP addresses for handling client queries, a set of caches, and egress IP addresses for communicating with nameservers. Load balancers manage the selection of caches and egress resolvers. Our measurement infrastructure, the Caches Discovery and Enumeration (CDE) Infrastructure, uses direct and indirect probers to communicate with the DNS resolution platforms.

## 2. Motivation for Studying Caches
Understanding the components of the Internet is essential for improving their security and designing mechanisms that depend on them. In this section, we discuss the importance of studying DNS caches.

### 2.1 Security
The structure and number of caches in DNS platforms are important for assessing the security against cache poisoning attacks. Using multiple caches increases the difficulty of such attacks. During a cache poisoning attack, spoofed responses containing incorrect DNS records are sent to the victim DNS resolver. While recent work has shown that defences can often be circumvented, using multiple caches makes it more challenging for an attacker to successfully inject spoofed records. Our tools help researchers and network operators evaluate the resilience and security of DNS platforms.

### 2.2 Resilience
Our tools allow network operators to assess the dependability and security of their networks without prior knowledge of the DNS platform's structure. For example, they can identify when caching components fail or are unavailable. Additionally, our tools can be used for large-scale studies of the Internet's dependability, non-intrusively and without requiring cooperation from the tested networks.

### 2.3 Tools for Network Management and Research
- **Consistency of DNS Record Caching:** Our tools differentiate between multiple caches and inconsistencies in TTL, helping researchers and network operators understand the true nature of DNS record caching.
- **Size of DNS Resolution Platforms:** As DNS is increasingly used for security mechanisms, our tools enable measuring the sizes of DNS resolution platforms to meet growing demands.
- **Device Discovery:** Our tools extend current device discovery mechanisms to detect hidden caches, which are not identified by IP addresses.
- **Measuring Software and New Mechanisms:** Our tools help in inferring the software used by DNS caches, which is important for distributing patches and upgrades and for studying the deployment of new DNS mechanisms.

## 3. Data Collection
For our data collection, we utilized three different approaches:
1. A distributed ad-network.
2. Email servers in popular domains.
3. Popular Alexa networks that operate open resolvers to reduce traffic to nameservers.

These diverse and representative datasets provide an accurate view of DNS resolution platforms. Prior studies typically focused on either the nameservers' side or scanning the IPv4 address block for open recursive resolvers.

When a DNS request is received, the value is checked in the cache. If the record is not found, the request is forwarded to the nameservers. Our tools analyze the DNS request/response behavior to infer information about the caches.
