ECDSA/PBC, the user end implementation is run on a desktop
computer, which has an Intel Core i5-3470 processor with 4
cores running at 3.2 Ghz each. The underlying OS is Windows
10 Enterprise Edition. The implementation of server (or “RP”)
is run by a Lenovo X3650 workstation, which has an Intel
Xeon E5-2640 v3 processor with 8 cores running at 2.60 Ghz
each, and runs the operating system of CentOS 7. For HoKA-
ECDSA/PBC, both “IdP” and “RP” are run by the workstation
as applications which are run by different cores.
VII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a strong authentication mecha-
nism which does not rely on tamper-resistant hardware mod-
ules at user end, from a new primitive called Password-Based
Credential (PBC), and show its application in federated identity
systems. We also present ΠPBC as an efﬁcient construction of
PBC, and evaluates its performances. The evaluation result
shows that the schemes with PBC also obtain better efﬁciency
than the traditional strong authentication mechanisms with
tamper-resistant hardware modules. As future work, we plan
to develop our PBC based schemes in real-world application
scenarios. It can be expected that our schemes help organiza-
tions and enterprises to provide their users with friendly and
strong authentication experiences in the future.
