Same as issue #11615
The glyphicon-th-list icon looks strange when in a button of normal size.
Please, check here: http://jsfiddle.net/2bxapnts/  
Bootstrap version: 3.2.0
Can be reproduced on: Chrome, Firefox and IE (Windows 8)  
In case it's significant, the default font size in my browser is 16px.

After playing around with the chrome console, it looks like it's not just the
fact that it is in a button but that this particular icon, when in font-size
14px (which is the font size in a normal button), looks different (with other
font sizes, it looks normal).
Strangely, on my tablet and also on my phone, the icon looks correct.  
I also tried on a Virtual machine with windows 7 and the issue can be
reproduced there.
It looks like it's Windows related but I cannot find the reason.
