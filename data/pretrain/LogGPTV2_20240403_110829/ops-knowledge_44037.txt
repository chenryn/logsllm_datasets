User: I have a problem: I used py2exe for my program, and it worked on my computer. I packaged it with Inno Setup (still worked on my computer), but when I sent it to a different computer, I got the following error when trying to run the application: "CreateProcess failed; code 14001." The app won't run.
(Note: I am using wxPython and the multiprocessing module in my program.)
I googled for it a bit and found that the the user should install some MS redistributable something, but I don't want to make life complicated for my users. Is there a solution?
Versions:
Python 2.6.2c1, 
py2exe 0.6.9, 
Windows XP Pro
Assistant: When you run py2exe, look closely at the final messages when it's completed. It gives you a list of DLLs that it says are needed by the program, but that py2exe doesn't automatically bundle.
Many in the list are reliably available on any Windows install, but there will be a few that you should manually bundle into your Inno Setup installation. Some are only needed if you want to deploy on older Windows installs e.g. Win 2000 or earlier.
