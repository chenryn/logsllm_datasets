### Teredo and IPv6 Transition Technologies

#### Introduction
Teredo is a tunneling protocol that enables IPv6 connectivity over an IPv4 network, even when nodes are behind one or more Network Address Translators (NATs). This section will cover the components of Teredo, address format, and how it works. Additionally, we will discuss the migration process from IPv4 to IPv6.

#### NAT and Teredo
Teredo in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP does not support symmetric NATs. Symmetric NATs map internal IP addresses and port numbers to different external addresses and ports based on the external destination address for outgoing traffic.

#### Teredo Components
**Figure 15-8: Teredo Components**
The components of Teredo include:

- **Teredo Client**: An IPv6/IPv4 node that supports a Teredo tunneling interface through which packets are tunneled to other Teredo clients or IPv6-only hosts via a Teredo relay.
- **Teredo Server**: An IPv6/IPv4 node connected to both the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. It assists in the initial configuration of Teredo clients and facilitates communication between Teredo clients and IPv6-only hosts.
- **Teredo Relay**: An IPv6/IPv4 router that forwards packets between Teredo clients on the IPv4 Internet and IPv6-only hosts on the IPv6 Internet.
- **Teredo Host-Specific Relay**: An IPv6/IPv4 node with interfaces and connectivity to both the IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. It can communicate directly with Teredo clients over the IPv4 Internet without needing an intermediate Teredo relay.

**Operating Systems Support:**
- Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 and later, Windows XP with SP2 and later, and Windows XP with SP1 and the Advanced Networking Pack for Windows XP include Teredo client and Teredo host-specific relay functionality.

#### Teredo Addresses
**Figure 15-9: Teredo Addresses**
A Teredo address consists of the following components:

- **Teredo Prefix**: The first 32 bits, typically 2001::/32 (or 3FFE:831F::/32, which is obsolete).
- **Teredo Server IPv4 Address**: The next 32 bits contain the IPv4 public address of the Teredo server.
- **Flags**: The next 16 bits are reserved for Teredo flags. The Cone flag is set if the Teredo client detects a cone NAT.
- **Obscured External Port**: The next 16 bits store an obscured version of the external UDP port, XORed with 0xFFFF.
- **Obscured External Address**: The last 32 bits store an obscured version of the external IPv4 address, XORed with 0xFFFFFFFF.

#### How Teredo Works
**Initial Configuration:**
- Teredo clients perform initial configuration by sending Router Solicitation messages to multiple Teredo servers.
- Windows-based Teredo clients obtain the IPv4 addresses of Teredo servers by querying `teredo.ipv6.microsoft.com` using DNS.
- The Teredo client constructs its Teredo address based on the received Router Advertisement messages, including the Teredo prefix, server's IPv4 address, flags, and obscured external port and address.

**Initial Communication Between Two Teredo Clients in Different Sites:**
- The communication process depends on whether the Teredo clients are behind cone or restricted NATs.
- For cone NATs, the NAT translation table allows traffic from any source, enabling direct communication.
- For restricted NATs, additional steps are required to create source-specific mappings before initial communication can occur.

**Figure 15-10: Initial Communication Process with Restricted NATs**
- **Step 1**: Teredo Client A sends a bubble packet to Teredo Client B, creating a source-specific mapping in the NAT for Teredo Client A.
- **Step 2**: Teredo Client A sends a bubble packet to Teredo Client B through Teredo Server 2.
- **Step 3**: Teredo Server 2 forwards the bubble packet to Teredo Client B.
- **Step 4**: Teredo Client B responds with a bubble packet to Teredo Client A.
- **Step 5**: Teredo Client A sends an initial communication packet directly to Teredo Client B, and subsequent packets are sent directly.

#### Migrating to IPv6
The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 involves several steps:

1. **Upgrade Applications**: Ensure applications are independent of IPv4 or IPv6.
2. **Update DNS Infrastructure**: Support IPv6 address (AAAA) and PTR records.
3. **Upgrade Hosts**: Deploy dual-stack architecture to support both IPv4 and IPv6.
4. **Deploy ISATAP**: Provide tunneled IPv6 connectivity.
5. **Upgrade Routing Infrastructure**: Configure routers for native IPv6 routing.
6. **Convert Nodes**: Gradually convert IPv6/IPv4 nodes to IPv6-only nodes.

#### Chapter Summary
- **Key Concepts**: Dual-stack architecture, DNS infrastructure, and tunneling technologies (ISATAP, 6to4, and Teredo) are essential for coexistence and migration.
- **Tunnel Types**: Configured tunnels require manual setup, while automatic tunnels determine endpoints dynamically.
- **Transition Steps**: Upgrade applications, DNS, hosts, and routing infrastructure, and deploy tunneling technologies.

#### Glossary
- **ISATAP**: Intra-site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol, providing unicast IPv6 connectivity within an IPv4 intranet.
- **6to4**: An IPv6 transition technology using a public IPv4 address to construct a global IPv6 address prefix.
- **Teredo**: An IPv6 transition technology providing unicast IPv6 connectivity across the IPv4 Internet, even behind NATs.
