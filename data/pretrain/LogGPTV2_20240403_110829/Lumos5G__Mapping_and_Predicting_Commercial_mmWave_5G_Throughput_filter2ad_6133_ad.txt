UE is in front of the panel; when 𝜃𝑝 is
around 180° (“B” in Fig. 12), the UE is

can define positions such as left (“L”)
and right (“R”). A general trend we find is that the F position exhibits
far better performance compared to the L, R, and B positions, in
particular when the UE-panel distance is short, as exemplified in
Fig. 13 (the south panel at Airport). There is a subtle difference
between 𝜃𝑝 and 𝜃𝑚. A UE with 𝜃𝑚 = 180° need not necessitate that
it is in front of the 5G panel. For instance, a UE with 𝜃𝑝 = 180°
positioned at the back (“B”) of 5G panel can also have 𝜃𝑚 = 180°. In
other words, as shown earlier in Fig. 5, 𝜃𝑝 differs from 𝜃𝑚 as the
former considers the UE’s absolute position instead of its moving
direction. Thus, both these angles (𝜃𝑝 and 𝜃𝑚) coupled with the
UE-panel distance is useful in capturing the UE’s location from the
5G panel’s perspective (more about these features in §5).

4.6 Impact of Mobility Speeds
Mobility is a major technical challenge in mmWave 5G due to the
physical layer characteristics of mmWave that make its signals
highly fluctuating thus causing wild variations in performance [17,
47]. Next, we conduct experiments in the wild to investigate the
impact of mobility speeds on 5G throughput. We repeatedly conduct
walking and driving tests on the 1300m Loop area (at least 30×
times). For the driving tests, we mounted the phone on the car’s
windshield while for the walking tests, we hand-held the phone
in front of us. Located in the Minneapolis downtown region, this
area covers a number of traffic/pedestrian lights, public transit
rail crossings, restaurants and popular joints, high rise buildings,
and a public park. Driving speeds on the loop ranged between 0

to 45 kmph while walking speeds hovered between 0 to 7 kmph.
Fig. 14 shows the throughput distributions of different ground
speeds (reported by Android API [16]), where each box represents
1-second samples measured for a given speed range. In the upper
plot (Fig. 14a), we find that mobility under driving mode has a
significant impact on 5G throughput. Statistically, the throughput
decreases as the driving speed increases. Under no-mobility to very

accounting for UE-side mobility-related factors in addition to UE’s
geolocation is able to better characterize 5G throughput (thus lead-
ing to better prediction accuracy) compared to using geolocation
alone. This motivates us to seek for a learning based approach for
5G throughput prediction.
5 LUMOS5G: CONTEXT-AWARE ML MODELS
FOR 5G THROUGHPUT PREDICTION
Building on the insights obtained in §4, in this section we discuss
the key considerations and criteria we employ for developing
ML models in Lumos5G framework for 5G throughput prediction.
In particular, we introduce the idea of feature groups to account
for diverse sets of impact factors at the UE-side, and develop
“composable” ML models that employ different sets of features
depending on the availability of the features and usage context.
5.1 Feature Selection & Grouping
As discussed, there are a whole gamut of diverse factors that impact
5G performance, many of them, e.g., channel state, various radio
impairments that may be sensed by the 5G base station, are not
readily available to applications running on the UE. Hence we focus
on UE-side features that can be measured and collected. We will
also take advantage of additional features, e.g., radio type, signal
strength, handoff information from the PHY layer, when available.
We introduce the notion of feature groups by classifying features into
several categories. This notion offers several benefits. (1) It helps
account for the collective effects and interplay of similar features.
(2) It allows us to select available and relevant features, and compose
feature sets depending on the usage case (e.g., stationary v/s. mobile
scenarios). (3) It enables us to compare ML models with different
feature combinations to investigate the importance of various
feature groups under diverse settings and develop explainable ML
models for 5G throughput prediction.
Table 6 lists four primary feature groups we consider in our
study. L represents the basic location-based feature group which
contains (pixelized) geographic location coordinates. M represents
the basic mobility-based feature group which includes moving speed
and compass direction (i.e., azimuth angle) that can be measured
using sensors on the UE. In place of location-based features, T
represents the (more advanced) tower-based feature group which
contains features such as the distance from a UE to the 5G panel,
positional (𝜃𝑝) and mobility (𝜃𝑚) angles to the 5G panel (see
Fig. 5 for illustrations). These features can be collected by the
UE but rely on exogenous information obtained, i.e., via the 5G
tower location/direction information measured by us or supplied
by the carrier. Despite that, ML models trained using them are
likely more transferable to other areas with similar geolocation
characteristics as the features do not depend on the absolute
locations of the UEs, i.e., being location-agnostic. C represents the
connection-based feature group which includes, e.g., (the immediate)
past throughput values measured by an application and/or various
low-level PHY-layer features provided by the UE, when available.
Next, in Table 6, we list four feature group combinations
“composed” of multiple primary feature groups: (i) L+M (the
Location+Mobility model); (ii) T+M (the Tower+Mobility model);
(iii) L+M+C (the Location+Mobility+Connection model); and
(iv) T+M+C (the Tower+Mobility+Connection model). We choose these

four combinations to compare the performance of ML models using
different feature groups under mobility scenarios, and to study
the feature group importance in 5G throughput prediction. We
consider ML models with and without connection-based features
for different use cases as connection-based features require a 5G
connection to be established for collecting measurement data. ML
models without connection features are still useful, for example, for
initial bitrate selection in adaptive video streaming. In addition to
the above four combinations, other feature group combinations may
also be formed to support other usage scenarios. Other primary
feature groups such as “static features” containing information
about the UE device model and specifications are also important
for 5G throughput prediction. However, our study is limited to only
one device model, hence we do not consider this feature group. This
is a limitation of our study and we discuss more about this in §8.
5.2 Proposed ML Models
Before we present our ML models proposed as part of the
Lumos5G framework, we first describe the basic settings. We
formalize the 5G throughput prediction either as a classification
problem or as a regression problem. We also consider the short-term
versus long-term prediction problems. These settings are motivated
by different use cases for the ML models.
5G Throughput Prediction as a Classification Problem. In
many settings, we are interested in knowing the “level” or range of
throughput a user may receive, e.g., low throughput (e.g., 100 Mbps)
or high throughput (e.g., 700 Mbps and above) or somewhere
in between, given her current location and usage context. This
reduces the 5G throughput prediction problem to a classification
problem: given a set of features/feature groups, predict the level of
5G throughput a user can be expected to receive (similar to the the
signal bars on a cellphone). This information can be used, e.g., for
initial bitrate selection for various applications. We consider three
throughput classes: low (below 300 Mbps), medium (from 300 Mbps
to 700 Mbps), and high (above 700 Mbps)5.
5G Throughput Prediction as a Regression Problem. In
many settings, however, we may have access to, e.g., a trajectory of
5These levels are chosen partially based on our analysis of 5G throughput variability. As
shown in §4, 5G throughput often fluctuates± 200 Mbps, due to various “uncontrollable”
random effects. Our ML models also work well with other choices of throughput classes;
the results for which are omitted.

feature values measured or calculated by the UE as a user is moving
along a route. Given such data, we want to predict the expected
throughput value at the next time slot (e.g., 1 second) or next 𝑘 time
slots (e.g., 30 seconds). Regression-based 5G throughput prediction
can aid many applications in making fine-grained decisions in the
duration of an ongoing session, e.g., to predict and select the quality
levels for adaptive video streaming.
Short-Term v/s. Long-Term Prediction. In the examples cited
above, throughput prediction is short-term, i.e., in the time scales
of seconds; they utilize current (or recent past) measured feature
values to predict the immediate future throughput. Such short-
term prediction is most useful for dynamic application decision
making; ML inference must be relatively light-weight. For general
5G throughput mapping, we are also interested in longer-term
prediction problems (e.g., in the time scales of minutes, hours, or
even days). Longer-term prediction will allow us to employ more
datasets and devote more computation resources for training and
inference; which can be valuable for network management and
planning applications, among others.
In Lumos5G, we consider two classes of ML models, one based
on a classical machine learning method – gradient decision boosted
trees (GDBT) [30], and another based on a deep learning technique –
sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) [59] which is particularly suited for
time-series/trajectory-based regression problems. We now briefly
describe these two classes of ML models.
• GDBT ML Models. Gradient boosting is a class of ML algo-
rithms that produces a strong prediction model in the form of a
weighted combination of weak learners which optimize a differ-
entiable loss function by gradient descent in functional space. It
follows an additive multi-stage approach in which weak learners
are added one at a time and gradient descent procedure is used
to minimize the loss when learners are added. The weak learners
are typically depth-bounded decision trees. We choose GDBT for
several reasons. First, it is lightweight, requiring little computation
power. Second, it is composable, allowing different sets of features
