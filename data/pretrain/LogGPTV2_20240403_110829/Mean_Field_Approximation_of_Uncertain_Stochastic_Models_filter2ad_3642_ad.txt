with two different control functions θ(t) that are piece-wise
constant:
(a)
(b)
A function θ1 that oscillates between ϑmin and ϑmax
according to the following rule: if θ2(t) = ϑmax and
XS(t)  0.85,
then θ2(t)
switches to ϑmax.
A function θ2 that
jumps to a new value with a
rate 5XI (t). The new value is picked uniformly on
[ϑmin, ϑmax].
These functions are chosen as they induce large variations of ϑ,
forcing large oscillations of the stochastic system. The control
function θ1 induces an almost-periodic behaviour of the mean
ﬁeld approximation. The function θ2 is more random.
A sample path in the steady state regime of the stochastic
system for N = 100, N = 1000 and N = 10000 is depicted
on Figure 6, along with the Birkhoff centre. We observe that
for N ≥ 1000, the stationary behaviour of the stochastic
system essentially remains inside of the Birkhoff centre for
both policies. The inclusion tends to be exact as N goes to
inﬁnity.

We compare the differential hull approximation (in dashed

[.02, 1.17]. When ϑmax = 6, the approximation is trivial for
t ≥ 4, for which we have XI (t) = 0 ≤ XI (t) ≤ XI (t) = 1.
In Figure 5, we compare the possible steady-states for the
imprecise model and the uncertain model with the bounds
obtained by the differential-hull approach. The differential-hull
approach provides a rectangular approximation for the steady-
state distribution. As for the transient regime, the differential-
hull approximation deteriorates non linearly in ϑmax: it is very
accurate for ϑmax = 2 or 3 but very loose for ϑmax = 5 (and
trivial for ϑmax ≥ 6 – not shown on the ﬁgure).
E. Comparison between the mean ﬁeld approximation and
stochastic simulations
Theorem 3 guarantees that when N is large, for any
control policy θ,
the stationary measure of the stochastic
system concentrates on a subset of the Birkhoff centre as N
goes to inﬁnity. In this section, we illustrate this result by
comparing a stochastic simulation of an imprecise Markov
population process of the SIR model for a ﬁnite N with the
limiting regime. We implemented a simulator of the SIR model
