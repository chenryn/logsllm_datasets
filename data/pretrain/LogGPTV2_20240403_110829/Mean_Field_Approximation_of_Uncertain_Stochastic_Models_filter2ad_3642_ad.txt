### Figure 5: Comparison of the Possible Steady-States

**Subfigures:**
- **(a) ϑmax = 2**
- **(b) ϑmax = 3**
- **(c) ϑmax = 4**
- **(d) ϑmax = 5**

**Description:**
This figure compares the possible steady-states for the imprecise model, the uncertain model, and the differential hull approximation. The differential-hull approach provides a rectangular approximation for the steady-state distribution. As the value of ϑmax increases, the accuracy of the differential-hull approximation decreases. For ϑmax = 2 or 3, the approximation is very accurate, but it becomes very loose for ϑmax = 5. For ϑmax ≥ 6, the approximation is trivial (not shown in the figure).

### Control Functions

Two different control functions, θ(t), are used, which are piecewise constant:
1. **θ1**: Oscillates between ϑmin and ϑmax according to the following rule:
   - If θ2(t) = ϑmax and XS(t) > 0.85, then θ2(t) switches to ϑmax.
2. **θ2**: Jumps to a new value with a rate 5XI(t). The new value is picked uniformly from [ϑmin, ϑmax].

These functions are chosen to induce large variations in ϑ, forcing significant oscillations in the stochastic system. The control function θ1 induces an almost-periodic behavior in the mean field approximation, while θ2 is more random.

### Stochastic System Behavior

A sample path in the steady-state regime of the stochastic system for N = 100, N = 1000, and N = 10000 is depicted in Figure 6, along with the Birkhoff center. For N ≥ 1000, the stationary behavior of the stochastic system remains within the Birkhoff center for both policies. The inclusion becomes exact as N approaches infinity.

### Illustrative Example: Generalized Processor Sharing Model

In this section, we consider another example from queueing theory, specifically a closed tandem queueing network with two classes of jobs. The first queue serves using GPS (Generalized Processor Sharing).

### Figure 4: Evolution of Proportions Over Time

**Description:**
- **Left Panel:** Proportion of susceptible individuals over time.
- **Right Panel:** Proportion of infected individuals over time.

**Comparison:**
- **Differential Hull Approximation (Dashed Line):** Compared with the imprecise model.
- **Values of ϑmax:** 2, 3, 4, and 5.

For ϑmax = 6, the approximation is trivial for t ≥ 4, where XI(t) = 0 ≤ XI(t) ≤ 1.

### Comparison Between Mean Field Approximation and Stochastic Simulations

Theorem 3 ensures that when N is large, for any control policy θ, the stationary measure of the stochastic system concentrates on a subset of the Birkhoff center as N approaches infinity. This result is illustrated by comparing a stochastic simulation of an imprecise Markov population process of the SIR model for a finite N with the limiting regime.

### Simulator Implementation

We implemented a simulator for the SIR model to compare the stochastic simulations with the mean field approximation. The results show that for large N, the stationary behavior of the stochastic system closely matches the Birkhoff center, confirming the theoretical predictions.

### Conclusion

The analysis and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the differential-hull approach in approximating the steady-state distribution of the imprecise model. The results also highlight the importance of considering the control functions and their impact on the system's behavior.
