Proof of Theorem 5. When c  (η)
=⇒ δ > 1/2 × (η) = non-negligible.
Thus, when 2μ ≤ N, a necessary condition for δ to become
negligible is 2(cid:4)p > 1 − neg(η).
When 2μ > N, using μ = N(1 − (1 − p)
) > N =⇒ (1 − p)

Now, we calculate the probability of Invariant 1 being true,
under our protocol Πideal and as in the proof for Theorem 3.
We distinguish two cases depending on c and (cid:4):

VISUAL 3D REPRESENTATIONS OF THE RESULTS
APPENDIX C
In the paper, we focus on lower-bound results for strong
anonymity (or negligible δ values). However, our key Theo-
rems 1, 3, 6 and 8 also offer lower bounds for non-negligilable
δ values, which can be of interest to several AC protocols.
On our project webpage [51], we visualize these lower
bounds using interactive 3D surface plots. In particular, we
plot the adversarial advantage δ ∈ [0, 1] as a function of β
and (cid:4). We encourage the readers to interact with these plots
to better understand our results for non-negligilbe δ values.
Here, in Figures 7 to 10, we present and analyze four
snapshots of those lower bound plots for the number of users
N = 10000. The x-axis represents latency (cid:4) (ranging from 0
to 200), and the y-axis bandwidth overhead β (ranging from
0.0 to 0.04). But in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the y-axis actually
represents total bandwidth p = p(cid:2)
+ β as in Theorem 7.

those regions, strong anonymity is not possible. For example,
as shown in Figure 7, for (cid:4) = 100 the bandwidth overhead β
has to be at least 0.01 to expect strong anonymity.
For the chosen c and K, the plots in Figures 7 and 8 are
almost identical as the (cid:4) and β factors contribute more to
anonymity than the compromised parties can affect it. If we
instead compare Figure 9 with Figure 10, the effect of com-
promisation is noticeable: the dark blue region in Figure 10 is
much smaller than that in Figure 9. Also, we can see a steep
wall in Figure 10 for (cid:4) ≤ c = 20, demonstrating that providing
anonymity becomes difﬁcult when (cid:4) c,
the effect of compromisation is less noticeable.
A derived δ lower bound for the non-compromising adver-
sary is also a valid lower bound for a (partially) compromising
adversary. For some edge cases (e.g., when (cid:4) is close to N
and β is close to 0), due to some approximations employed in
the compromising adversaries scenario, the non-compromising
adversary lower bound is actually tighter than the compromis-
ing adversaries lower bound. Therefore, in Figure 10, while
plotting the 3D graph for a partially compromising adversary
scenario, we have used the maximum of the lower bounds on δ
for compromising adversary and non-compromising adversary.
In each plot, the dark blue region indicates the possibility
of obtaining strong anonymity. For any point (x, y) outside
