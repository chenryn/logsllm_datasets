**Issue Description**

When running the command `npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts --project=Chromium`, a deprecation warning for the `Buffer()` constructor is repeatedly thrown. This issue persists even after upgrading to the latest alpha build, which includes the fix from Merge PR 14638 to hide the `DeprecationWarning` of `fd-slicer`.

The warning message is as follows:
```
(node:PID) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues. Please use the Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() methods instead.
```

This warning appears to be triggered by a specific data-driven JSON file. When this JSON file is removed, the warnings disappear. There are no duplicate versions of Playwright or Playwright/test installed in the project.

While this is not a critical issue, it significantly clutters the test output, making it difficult to read and analyze.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository: `qa-automation-playwright`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the test command: `npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts --project=Chromium`.
4. Observe the repeated deprecation warnings in the test output.

## Expected Behavior

The test should run without any deprecation warnings, providing a clean and readable output.

## Actual Behavior

The test output is cluttered with the following deprecation warning:
```
(node:PID) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: Buffer() is deprecated due to security and usability issues. Please use the Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() methods instead.
```

## Additional Information

- **Repository:** qa-automation-playwright
- **Node.js Version:** [Your Node.js version]
- **Playwright Version:** [Your Playwright version]
- **Operating System:** [Your operating system]

## Suggested Fix

To resolve this issue, you should replace all instances of `new Buffer()` with the recommended alternatives: `Buffer.alloc()`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe()`, or `Buffer.from()`. This change will ensure that the code is compliant with the latest security and usability standards.

If the issue is specifically caused by a third-party library, consider checking if there is an updated version of the library that addresses this deprecation warning. If not, you may need to fork the library and make the necessary changes yourself.

## Minimum Reproducible Example

To help diagnose and fix the issue, a minimal reproducible example can be found in the `qa-automation-playwright` repository. The specific file causing the issue is the data-driven JSON file used in the tests.

**Note:** Ensure that the JSON file and the relevant test code are included in the repository for easy reproduction of the issue.
