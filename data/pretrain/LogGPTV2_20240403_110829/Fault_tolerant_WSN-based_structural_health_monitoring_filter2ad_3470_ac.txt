B.  Extract Natural Frequency Set in Each Cluster 
In each cluster, we use the extracted natural frequency set 
from each sensor node to find out the faulty nodes. This is 
based on  the premise  that the  healthy  sensor  nodes  in  each 
cluster  have  the  similar  natural  frequency  sets.    For  the 
faulty sensor nodes, for example nodes which debond from 
the  attached  structure  or  experience  sensor  breakage,  the 
‘natural  frequency  sets’  estimated  from  these  sensor  nodes 
will be significantly different from normal ones.   
A very intriguing property of natural frequencies is that 
they  can  discriminate  sensor faults  from  structural damage.   
As  was  described,  sensor  faults  will  cause  the  significant 
deviation of the extracted natural frequency set from others 
in  the  same  substructure.    On  the  contrary,  structural 
damage does not have this effect. The natural frequency set 
in  the  damaged  structure  is  still  a  global  parameter  which 
means  that  the  natural  frequency  set  extracted  from  each 
sensor node will still match with each other after structural 
damage (although the natural frequency set can be different 
from that obtained when the structure is healthy). Therefore, 
when the natural frequency set from a node is significantly 
different from others in the same cluster, the possible cause 
should be sensor fault instead of structural damage.

The  problem  then  becomes  how  to  identify  the  natural 
frequency  set  using  data  from  each  sensor  node.    In  this 
paper, we first calculate the spectral density of sensor nodes 
and  then  use  the  peak-picking  (PP)  method[18]  to  identify 
natural  frequencies.    From  the  deployed  sensor  nodes  in 
each cluster, we calculate the power spectral density (PSD) 
of the CH and cross spectral density (CSD) between the CH 
and each of the cluster members. PSD and CSD functions are 
estimated using: 
where G(cid:2934)(cid:2935)(ω)   is  the  CSD  between  two  vibration 
member,  respectively. X(ω)   and Y(ω)   are  the  Fourier 
conjugate. N  is time length of each record xi(t) or yi(t). nd is 
signals,  x(t)  and  y(t),  measured  from  CH  and  a  cluster 
transforms  of  x(t)  and  y(t),  and  ‘*’  denotes  the  complex 
G(cid:2934)(cid:2935)(ω)(cid:3404) 1n(cid:2914)N(cid:3533)X(cid:2919)(cid:1499)(ω)·Y(cid:2919)(ω)
the number of averages mainly for denoising purpose and nd 
practically  ranges  from  10  to  20.  When  calculating  Gxy, 
consecutive  records  of  xi(t)(also  yi(t))  generally  overlap. 
When  y(t)  in  Eq.  2  is  replace  by  x(t),  the  PSD  of  CH  is 
obtained. 
(2) 
Traditionally,  measurements  from  all  the  sensor  nodes 
are  sent  back  to  the  CH,  where  the  PSD  and  the  CSD  are 
calculated.  However 
this  approach  requires  significant 
amount of wireless communication if implemented in WSNs. 
In  this  paper,  the  estimation  of  CSD  is  tailored  for  WSNs. 
Instead  of  collecting  the  measurements  from  all  the  cluster 
members,  the  CH  broadcasts  its  time  record.  On  receiving 
the  record,  each  node  calculates  the  CSD  between  its  own 
data and the received record and stores it locally (see Fig. 8).     
Figure 8 Distributed correlation function estimation in a cluster 
Moreover, since this procedure will be repeated nd times 
(see Eq. (2)), storing all the previously estimated CSDs and 
then averaging them requires large memory space. Therefore, 
Eq.  (2)  is  modified  to  be  iterative  by  taking  a  weighted 
average between the stored CSD and the current estimate:   
G(cid:2934)(cid:2935)(cid:2919) (ω)(cid:3404)i(cid:3398)1i G(cid:2934)(cid:2935)(cid:2919)(cid:2879)(cid:2869)(ω)(cid:3397)1iX(cid:2919)(cid:1499)(ω)·Y(cid:2919)(ω)
where G(cid:2934)(cid:2935)(cid:2919) (ω)  is  the  ith  updated  CSD  (i=1,…nd).  This 
iterative  version  significantly  decreases  the  memory  space 
required. 
After obtaining the CSD and PSD, the peak-picking (PP) 
technique  is  adopted  to  extract  natural  frequencies.  In  PP, 
each  node  picks  the  p  largest  peaks  from  its  CSD  (for  the 
CH, the PSD is used) by scanning for frequencies at which 
the  value  of  the  spectrum  is  significantly  and  consistently 
higher  than  the  value  of  the  spectrum  at  surrounding 
frequencies.  If  less  than  p  peaks  are  found,  zeros  will  be 
(3) 
returned  in  place of  the  missing  peaks.  A  typical  CSD  and 
the natural frequencies using the PP method are illustrated in 
Fig.  8,  where  the  extracted  natural  frequency  set  is 
{6,34,37,99,194,317, 470}.

Figure 9 A typical CSD function and the natural frequencies extracted 
using the PP method (each red dot corresponds to a natural frequency) 
After extracted the natural frequencies, each sensor node 
sends the obtained natural frequency set to its CH. CH will 
detect faulty nodes in its cluster afterwards 
We  will  show  that,  a  topology  with  fewer  clusters  is 
advantageous  since  less  amount  of  wireless  transmission  is 
required  in  the  above  natural  frequency  identification 
strategy.    In  a  cluster,  the  sensor  data  broadcast  from  the 
CH  is  generally  long,  while  the  data  sent  from  all  other 
sensors  to  the  CH  is  small  (which  is  only  the  identified 
natural frequency set). Thus, the amount of transmitted data 
can be reduced by adopting a topology with fewer clusters. 
More formally, assuming the time history record of length N 
and nd times averaging, the total number of transmitted data 
points is at most N(cid:2914)(cid:2911)(cid:2930)(cid:2911)(cid:3404)n(cid:2917)(N·n(cid:2914)(cid:3397)p(n(cid:2929)(cid:3398)1))
(4)
where n(cid:2917)  and n(cid:2929)  are the numbers of clusters and sensor 
nodes, respectively. N is the data length of x(t) and y(t), p  is 
N, nd, p and ns, N(cid:2914)(cid:2911)(cid:2930)(cid:2911)  can be minimized by minimizing the 
number  of  clusters n(cid:2917) .  This  justifies  the  objective  of 
the  identified  natural  frequencies  from  each  sensor.    Given 
clustering problem in the previous section. 
C.  Faulty Nodes Detection Through Natural Frequency 
Matching 
After  CH  receives  all  the  natural  frequency  sets  of  its 
cluster members, these frequency sets are compared to detect 
faulty  sensor  nodes. 
Intuitively,  sensor  nodes  with 
significantly different natural frequency sets from others will 
be  labeled  as  faulty.    However,  it  should  be  noted  the 
identified  natural  frequency  set  from  each  sensor  node  is  a 
vector  (see  Eq.  (1a)).  Due  to  the  environmental  noise, 
different deployed locations, we cannot guarantee that the kth 
natural  frequencies  of  two  sensor  nodes  correspond  to  the 
same  vibration  pattern  of  a  structure.  Some  sensor  nodes, 
although  they  are  healthy,  may  miss  identifying  some  true 
natural  frequencies  or  erroneously  obtain  several  pseudo 
frequencies.      For  example,  assume  the  first  four  natural 
frequencies of a structure is   
(cid:1806)(cid:2930)(cid:2928)(cid:2931)(cid:2915)(cid:3404)(cid:4668)1,4,5,10(cid:4669)

The  identified  natural  frequency  sets  from  two  healthy 
sensor nodes can turn out to be as:

Based  on  the  example  above,  it  is  important  to  first 
identify  the  comparable  natural  frequencies  of  different 
precisely and we only have the natural frequency sets from 
available sensors. This increases the difficulty to identify the 
comparable frequencies in sensor nodes. Things can be more 
complicated in the presence of faulty sensor nodes.   
Given a collection of natural frequency sets from sensor 
nodes,  we  use  the  following  method  to  find  out  the 
comparable natural frequencies and the faulty sensor nodes. 
Before  we  describe  the  method,  we  will  give  a  formal 
definition  of  comparable  natural  frequencies  and  how  to 
select these frequencies. 
Assume using the PP method, natural frequencies from m 
sensors  are  extracted,  each  sensor  having  p  natural 
frequencies.  These  frequencies  are  arranged  in  a  m-by-p 
matrix:
