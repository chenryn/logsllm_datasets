the other hand, have more long-lived failures that last for
tens of minutes or even up to several hours. To gain a bet-
ter insight into these long lasting failures, we investigate
157 failures in 27 distinct Tele2@Netcom connections which
lasted for more than 1 hour. These connections are from
NNE nodes that also have both a Netcom connection and
a Telenor connection. Almost half of these failures (48.4%)
aﬀected the corresponding Netcom connections at the same
time. The Telenor connections, however, remained stable.
Hence, we feel safe that these long-lasting failures are not
artifacts of our measurements. They seem rather related to
the radio access availability, coverage, and possibly the in-
teraction between the modems and the network. We plan
to investigate the root cause of these failures in our future
work.
Downtime. Telenor and Network Norway@Telenor con-
nections have less overall downtime compared to the other
networks. The percentage of connections experiencing more
than 10 minutes of downtime per day ranges from 38% for
Tele2@Netcom to 15% for Network Norway@Telenor. Fail-
ures that last more than 10 minutes are between 5.1% and
13.5% of all failures depending on the operator. They are,
however, responsible for between 96.4% and 98.7% of the
overall downtime. Besides characterizing the overall connec-
tion downtime, we also investigate how connection stability
has varied during our study period. To this end, we cal-
culate the median daily downtime percentage per network
measured as the median downtime across all connections
available on each day. Figure 8 shows the time series of this
metric for all networks throughout the study period. For all
networks, the median daily downtime remains stable hint-
ing at no signiﬁcant changes in connection stability during

tor.
our measurement period. Further, the time series are in
line with the observations we made earlier in this section.
Networks that share the same RAN exhibit similar median
daily downtime. Also, Telenor and Network Norway@Telen-
or are a characterized by a frequently observed median daily
downtime of 5e − 5%, which corresponds to a single outage
of 4.32 seconds. This higher downtime percentage for both
networks is consistent with our observation that they suf-
fer more frequent short-lived failures compared to the other
networks.
4.3 Correlating with metadata
To understand what may trigger the connection to be bro-
ken, we correlate the downtime due to PDP failures in a
certain hour with the connection mode (e.g., 2G or 3G), the
average RSSI, and the average Ec/Io in that hour. To corre-
late with the connection mode, we say that a connection is
in 3G (2G) mode in a given hour if it stays in 3G (2G) mode
for at least 70% of its available time. Further, to construct
a meaningful correlation with the signal quality, we group
the average RSSI values into ﬁve categories that correspond
to the standard mobile phones signal bars: 1 bar (-103 dBm
or lower), 2 bars (-98 dBm to -102 dBm), 3 bars (-87 dBm
to -97 dBm), 4 bars (-78 dBm to -86 dBm), and 5 bars (-77
dBm or higher). We also group the average Ec/Io values

nal quality (i.e. the signal to noise ratio) capturing both in-
terference with ambient and surrounding noise as well as in-
terference from cross traﬃc at adjacent frequencies. We fur-
ther correlate these three parameters to investigate whether
a single measure is suﬃcient to describe the radio condition
and consequently connection stability. Across operators, we
do not observe clear correlation between RSSI and connec-
tion mode. Poor Ec/Io, however, strongly correlates with
RSSI of one bar as well as with 2G connectivity. This sug-
gests that Ec/Io can be picked as a predicator of connection
stability.
The above explained correlations are visible in all opera-
tors, but the relation between downtime and metadata is not
always linear. For instance, the correlation between diﬀerent
Ec/Io categories and connection stability is more evident in
Telenor and Network Norway@Telenor than in Netcom and
Tele2@Netcom. This suggests that disconnects in Telenor
and Network Norway@Telenor are more often caused by the
radio conditions, matching well with the short MTTRs dis-
cussed above. While such failures also exist for Netcom and
Tele2@Netcom, they are masked by the dominating long-
lasting failures.
Summary of ﬁndings. The results presented in this sec-
tion show that many connections have a downtime that can
be problematic for critical applications, such as alarms or
payment systems. 15-38% of connections are unavailable
more than 10 minutes per day on average. There are also
clear diﬀerences in connection stability between operators.
While Telenor experiences relatively frequent but short-lived
failures caused by the failure to acquire a dedicated radio
channel, other operators have less frequent but longer lived
failures giving a higher overall downtime. We further ﬁnd
that the connection level reliability is highly dependent on
the RAN. In particular there is a high correlation between
downtime and the signal-to-noise ratio of the connection.
Still, there is also a signiﬁcant number of connection failures
that can not be explained by radio conditions. These may
be caused by congestion or central failures in the network.
5. DATAPLANE RELIABILITY AND
PER-FORMANCE
This section looks at the networks’ ability to deliver un-
interrupted packet forwarding with an acceptable loss rate.
Based on continuous end-to-end probing, we report on packet
loss and on the duration of unavailable periods where no

into three commonly used categories: Good (0 dB> Ec/Io
>-8 dB), Medium (-8 dB> Ec/Io >-15 dB), Bad (-15dB>
Ec/Io <-33 dB) [10].
The left panel in Fig. 9 shows the CDF of the downtime
percentage per hour, split according to the connection mode.
This plot includes all connections from all operators. The
center and right panels show the CDF of the downtime expe-
rienced at diﬀerent RSSI levels and at diﬀerent Ec/Io levels
respectively. The downtime is markedly higher for 2G con-
nections than for 3G connections. We record 1% downtime
or more in 1% of the hours with 3G connectivity compared to
9% of the hours with 2G connectivity. Further, as expected,
downtime is inﬂuenced by the signal quality. Connections
with an average RSSI equivalent to one signal bar have sig-
niﬁcantly higher downtimes. Beyond that, the diﬀerences
between signal bar levels are less signiﬁcant. Downtime also
correlates strongly with Ec/Io categories. We further ob-
serve that a sizable fraction of hours with downtime exists
even when having good Ec/Io or RSSI. For example, we ex-
perience downtime in 5% of the hours characterized by a
good Ec/Io. This indicates that radio quality can not alone
explain all connection failures. To explain the stronger cor-
relation between downtime and Ec/Io as opposed to RSSI,
we note that the RSSI measures the received signal strength
which include all received components (i.e. signal and noise).
Hence, a high RSSI does not necessarily translate into a good
radio condition. Ec/Io on the other hand measures the sig-

packets come through. We look at how these metrics are
related to mode, radio state and and signal quality. Finally,
we identify particular events where a large fraction of con-
nections simultaneously experienced abnormal packet loss
rates.
5.1 Measurement description
Data plane reliability is measured by sending one 20 byte
UDP packet to an echo server every second, and record-
ing the reply packet from the server. A timestamp and an
incremental sequence number is included in the packet pay-
load for duplicate detection and round-trip time calculation.
While the round-trip time normally is in the order of tens
of milliseconds, we sometimes observe delays in the order of
several seconds. Such high delays can sometimes be caused
by excessive buﬀering [13]. We consider a packet to be lost
if we do not receive a reply within 60 seconds.
This measurement test starts automatically on all network
interfaces as they become active, and keeps running as long
as the interface is up. When the connection is not available,
the measurement script stops sending request packets and
waits until the connection becomes available again. In total,
more than 10 billion data points were collected from June
2013 to Apr. 2014. The measurement duration for each con-
nection varies depending on how long the node was available
and had working connections. In the following analysis, we
require that we have at least 10 days of measurements to
include a connection in the discussion. Due to space lim-
itations we focus on packet loss in this section, and defer
discussing delays and duplicates to future work.
5.2 Loss rate
The CDF in Fig. 10 shows the overall average loss rate
for each connection in all operators. The loss rate is deﬁned
as (lost packets)/(sent packets) for the whole measurement
period. Loss is relatively limited in all networks, and 50%
of connections have less than 1% packet loss in all opera-
tors. We observe that relatively fewer Telenor connections
have a very low packet loss rate compared to the other net-
works. 72% of Telenor connections have a loss rate higher
than 0.5%, whereas this ratio is between 42 and 56% for
the other networks. Telenor does not, however, have many
connections with a high loss rate. Only 10% of connections
have more than 5% loss, compared to 20% for Netcom and
23% for Tele2. Overall, Network Norway and Ice have the
lowest packet loss rates.
There are diurnal patterns in packet loss in all networks,
with higher loss rates in oﬃce hours when traﬃc is more in-
tense. Ice, which has a larger fraction of home users, reaches
their highest loss rates around 8PM. Packet loss in Telenor
is consistently higher than in other networks throughout the
day, also outside peak hours. We therefore believe that this
higher packet loss is due to the RAN conﬁguration rather
than capacity limitations. To account for possible hard-
ware, software or conﬁguration changes over time in MBB
networks, in Fig. 11 we plot the median daily loss rate for
each MBB operator. We see that during the whole measure-
ment period the median loss percentage remains stable and
conforms with the results show in Fig. 10. Days with unusu-
ally high loss percentage are due to large events presented
later in this section.
Networks diﬀer in the thresholds they use to promote a
connection from CELL FACH to CELL DCH. Telenor is
more conservative than the other networks in such promo-
tions [15], and hence the measured Telenor connections are
more often in CELL FACH. For instance, a Telenor con-
nection spends on average 65% of its time in CELL FACH
compared to 34% for a Netcom connection. Unlike in the
other networks, Telenor connections have a higher loss rate
in CELL FACH than in CELL DCH, indicating that this
channel is operating closer to its capacity limit4. Telenor
does, however, have higher packet loss than other operators
also when on CELL DCH, so this can not alone explain the
diﬀerence.
To further explain the observed diﬀerences, we have looked
at loss rates combined with the metadata collected in paral-
lel with the measurements. We ﬁrst observe that loss rates
are similar for 2G and 3G connections in all networks, with
the exception of Netcom, where 2G loss is higher. A typical
Netcom connection experiences more than 1% packet loss in
60% (25%) of all hours when it is on 2G (3G). Loss increases
in periods when connections perform vertical handovers be-
tween 2G and 3G.
Not surprisingly, loss is higher in connections with poor
signal quality. The Venn diagram in Fig. 12 shows that many

capacity issues in the FACH channel.

be made available for other connections.
5.4 Large events
Next, we discuss large events, where many connections in
an operator experiences abnormal packet loss at the same
time. Such events will normally be caused by failures in
the CN. To identify and analyze large events, we ﬁrst divide
our measurement time series into 5 minute intervals, and
calculate the loss rate for each connection in each interval.
Additionally, to account for downtime periods, all 5 minute
intervals when a connection was unavailable are assigned
a 100% loss rate. We consider that a connection has an
abnormal loss rate in a particular 5 minute interval if more
than 10% of the packets are lost. A large event is deﬁned
as a period of one or more intervals when more than 10% of
all connections in an operator has abnormal packet loss.
Figure 14 shows a visual representation of all large events
recorded during our measurement period. Each event is rep-
resented by a circle (multiple events in the same day are
merged). The diameter of the circle reﬂects the severity of
the event, and can be thought of as the total volume of lost
traﬃc. This is calculated as the product of the fraction of
aﬀected connections, the average loss rate in the aﬀected
connections, and the duration of the lossy period. The frac-
tion of aﬀected connections is also represented on the y-axis.
As seen in the ﬁgure, networks experience large events
with varying severity and frequency. Short-lived events with
limited loss and aﬀecting 10-20% of connections happen on
a weekly basis in all networks. These events might be at-
tributed to short-lived congestion, and may be considered
part of normal operation. There are, however, also a num-
ber of larger events that can severely inﬂuence the user ex-
perience.
The collected measurements can normally give a good idea
about the underlying cause for the more severe large events.
By looking at the geographical distribution of the aﬀected
connections, the aﬀected RAN(s), loss intensity and other
parameters, we can often pin the root cause to either the
transmission network, the CN, or to the interconnection be-
tween operators.
For example, on Sept. 10 2013, most Tele2 connections ex-
perienced 20-50% packet loss for around 40 minutes. Similar
behavior repeated itself on Oct. 28 and on Nov. 16. These
failures happened outside of maintenance windows, and af-
fected connections from all parts of the country, and were
therefore likely related to a component in the CN. Tele2 has
later informed us that these events were probably caused by
