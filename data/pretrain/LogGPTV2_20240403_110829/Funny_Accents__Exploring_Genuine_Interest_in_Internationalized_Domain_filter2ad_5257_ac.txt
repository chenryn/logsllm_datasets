Another edge case was introduced during the revision of the IDNA stan-
dard. Four characters (so-called “deviations”) are valid in both versions, but
are interpreted diﬀerently [12]: for example, the German ß is supported as-is
in IDNA2008 but converted to ss in IDNA20032. This results in two diﬀerent
domains, but the visited domain depends on which version of the standard a
browser implements.
This does not only aﬀect user experience, i.e. when links on web pages or out-
side the browser (e.g. in emails) point to diﬀerent resources, but also has security
implications. The ß domain may host a spooﬁng or phishing site replicating that
of the ss domain [12]. Moreover, resources included from an ß domain could
originate from another domain in diﬀerent browsers, allowing to insert malicious
content. Requiring the same owner for both domains will prevent such attacks,
although errors due to misconﬁgured websites may persist. However, for example
even the German .de registry does not currently enforce this for ß and ss.
Unfortunately, Table 4a shows that major browsers do not agree on which
IDNA standard to implement, causing them to direct users to diﬀerent websites
as shown in Fig. 2. An ß character occurs in 55 candidate IDNs, of which 26
are registered, including several bank websites. 9 domains do not belong to the

same owner: the ß domain is then almost unreachable from Chromium-based
and Microsoft browsers (users would have to type or follow a link to the already
converted A-label), and there is potential for phishing or spooﬁng attacks.
Email clients also handle domains with ß diﬀerently, even between receiving
and sending (Table 4b). On Outlook, the sender ﬁeld remains empty. More wor-
ringly, we found that iOS Mail displayed an email received from an ß domain
(e.g. user@straße.de) as coming from the domain with ss (PI:EMAIL). This
vulnerability enables phishing attacks by the owner of the ß domain; moreover,
checks such as SPF will succeed as they are carried out by the mail exchangers
and not the client. A reply will also be sent to the ß domain, potentially leaking
sensitive information to a third party. We disclosed this vulnerability to Apple,
and it was ﬁxed in iOS 12.1.1 [4], which now displays the correct U-label.
6 Discussion
As registries are ultimately responsible for managing which domains can be
registered and who can own them, they are in a prime position to combat IDN-
related abuse. The most recent version of ICANN’s IDN implementation guide-
lines [29] calls for registries to prohibit registrations of domain name variants
with accented or homoglyph characters, or limit them to the same owner [40].
While certain registries implement these measures [6,11,51,52], other registries
that support IDNs usually either only apply such policies to homograph domains
but not domains with diacritics, or do not impose any restriction at all, allowing
malicious actors or domain squatters to register the IDNs with genuine interest.
On the client side, browsers and email clients represent the most visible and
widespread use of IDNs. However, we have shown that they do not yet universally
support the display of IDNs in Unicode, degrading the user experience. Moreover,
measures put in place by browser vendors to prevent homograph attacks have
been shown to be insuﬃcient on multiple occasions [21,41,71]; we have done
the same for a popular email client. Mozilla has expressed the opinion that
registries are responsible for preventing IDN abuse, and that browser restrictions
risk degrading the usefulness of IDNs [44]. Indeed, the manually developed and

heuristic-based defenses cannot be expected to comprehensively solve this issue.
Other protection mechanisms such as TLS and SPF also cannot prevent these
attacks, as e.g. certiﬁcates can legitimately be acquired for the malicious IDN.
Owners of popular brands and domains can register the IDN with genuine
interest, either as a real replacement or supplementary domain, or to proactively
stop others from abusing it. However, while this may be enough to combat
(more dangerous) abuse of the ‘valid’ IDN with genuine interest, registering all
other variant domains with homoglyphs, diacritics, and potential typos quickly
becomes infeasible in terms of cost and coverage. Shared ownership of IDNs with
genuine interest is already much more common than of other homograph IDNs
(over 50% vs. almost 5% [41]). However, it is still concerning that at least 35%
allow third parties to take hold of the valuable IDNs with genuine interest.
An unfortunate outcome of the issues surrounding IDNs would be to dis-
courage the adoption of IDNs and to recommend that users distrust them. IDNs
enable anyone to use the Internet in their native language, providing them a
great beneﬁt in user experience. IDNs also allow companies to create a better
integration of brands with their Internet presence, e.g. combining a logo with a
TLD in marketing material, providing additional economic value.
7 Conclusion
We have introduced the concept of Internationalized Domain Names for which
there is genuine interest: domains that represent popular brands or phrases with
diacritical marks. By comparing the page titles and domain names for 849 341
websites, we generated 15 276 such IDNs. We ﬁnd 43% of them to be available
for registration without restrictions, leaving the opportunity for a third party
to exploit the IDN. For the 3 189 registered domains, we see that ownership is
split: at least half have the same owner and content as the original domain,
but at least a third belongs to another entity, usually domain squatters who
have put the domain up for sale. The IDNs are not known to exhibit malicious
activity, although cases of questionable behavior can be found. From insecure
TLS setups and IDNs showing old versions of the original domain, we can see that
brand owners who registered IDNs tend to ‘forget’ conﬁguring them properly.
Finally, we ﬁnd applications to treat IDNs with diacritical marks inconsistently,
displaying Unicode or a less readable alternative depending on resemblance to a
popular domain or on the implemented version of the IDNA standard. We even
found a phishing vulnerability on iOS Mail, where the actual sender domain
diﬀers from the one displayed. While brand owners have already somewhat found
their way to IDNs with genuine interest, and while registries and browser vendors
start to deploy tools to prevent IDN abuse, support for IDNs remains challenging,
which unfortunately does not encourage their uptake in the near future.
