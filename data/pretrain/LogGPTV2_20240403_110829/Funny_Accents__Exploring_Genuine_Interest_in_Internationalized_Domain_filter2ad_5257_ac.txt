### Another Edge Case Introduced During the IDNA Standard Revision

During the revision of the Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) standard, an additional edge case was introduced. Four characters, referred to as "deviations," are valid in both IDNA2003 and IDNA2008 but are interpreted differently [12]. For example, the German character ß is supported as-is in IDNA2008 but is converted to "ss" in IDNA2003. This results in two different domain names, with the visited domain depending on which version of the standard a browser implements.

This discrepancy not only affects user experience—such as when links on web pages or in emails point to different resources—but also has significant security implications. The ß domain could host a spoofing or phishing site that mimics the ss domain [12]. Additionally, resources included from an ß domain might originate from a different domain in various browsers, allowing the insertion of malicious content. Requiring the same owner for both domains would mitigate such attacks, although errors due to misconfigured websites may still persist. However, even the German .de registry does not currently enforce this for ß and ss.

Unfortunately, Table 4a shows that major browsers do not agree on which IDNA standard to implement, leading to users being directed to different websites, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The character ß appears in 55 candidate IDNs, of which 26 are registered, including several bank websites. Nine of these domains do not belong to the same owner, making the ß domain almost unreachable from Chromium-based and Microsoft browsers (users would need to type or follow a link to the already converted A-label), and creating potential for phishing or spoofing attacks.

### Email Client Handling of Domains with ß

Email clients also handle domains with ß differently, even between receiving and sending (Table 4b). On Outlook, the sender field remains empty. More concerning, iOS Mail displays an email received from an ß domain (e.g., user@straße.de) as coming from the domain with "ss" (PI:EMAIL). This vulnerability enables phishing attacks by the owner of the ß domain. Moreover, checks such as SPF will succeed as they are carried out by the mail exchangers and not the client. A reply will also be sent to the ß domain, potentially leaking sensitive information to a third party. We disclosed this vulnerability to Apple, and it was fixed in iOS 12.1.1 [4], which now displays the correct U-label.

### Discussion

Registries, responsible for managing domain registrations, are in a prime position to combat IDN-related abuse. The most recent version of ICANN’s IDN implementation guidelines [29] calls for registries to prohibit the registration of domain name variants with accented or homoglyph characters, or limit them to the same owner [40]. While some registries implement these measures [6, 11, 51, 52], others either apply policies only to homograph domains or do not impose any restrictions, allowing malicious actors or domain squatters to register IDNs with genuine interest.

On the client side, browsers and email clients represent the most visible and widespread use of IDNs. However, we have shown that they do not yet universally support the display of IDNs in Unicode, degrading the user experience. Measures put in place by browser vendors to prevent homograph attacks have been insufficient on multiple occasions [21, 41, 71]; we have found the same for a popular email client. Mozilla has expressed the opinion that registries are responsible for preventing IDN abuse, and that browser restrictions risk degrading the usefulness of IDNs [44]. Indeed, manually developed and heuristic-based defenses cannot comprehensively solve this issue. Other protection mechanisms such as TLS and SPF also cannot prevent these attacks, as certificates can legitimately be acquired for the malicious IDN.

Owners of popular brands and domains can register IDNs with genuine interest, either as a real replacement or supplementary domain, or to proactively stop others from abusing it. However, while this may be enough to combat (more dangerous) abuse of the 'valid' IDN with genuine interest, registering all other variant domains with homoglyphs, diacritics, and potential typos quickly becomes infeasible in terms of cost and coverage. Shared ownership of IDNs with genuine interest is already much more common than other homograph IDNs (over 50% vs. almost 5% [41]). However, it is still concerning that at least 35% allow third parties to take hold of the valuable IDNs with genuine interest.

An unfortunate outcome of the issues surrounding IDNs would be to discourage their adoption and recommend that users distrust them. IDNs enable anyone to use the Internet in their native language, providing a great benefit in user experience. They also allow companies to create better integration of brands with their Internet presence, e.g., combining a logo with a TLD in marketing material, providing additional economic value.

### Conclusion

We have introduced the concept of Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) for which there is genuine interest: domains that represent popular brands or phrases with diacritical marks. By comparing the page titles and domain names for 849,341 websites, we generated 15,276 such IDNs. We find that 43% of them are available for registration without restrictions, leaving the opportunity for a third party to exploit the IDN. For the 3,189 registered domains, we see that ownership is split: at least half have the same owner and content as the original domain, but at least a third belongs to another entity, usually domain squatters who have put the domain up for sale. The IDNs are not known to exhibit malicious activity, although cases of questionable behavior can be found. From insecure TLS setups and IDNs showing old versions of the original domain, we can see that brand owners who registered IDNs tend to 'forget' configuring them properly. Finally, we find applications to treat IDNs with diacritical marks inconsistently, displaying Unicode or a less readable alternative depending on resemblance to a popular domain or on the implemented version of the IDNA standard. We even found a phishing vulnerability on iOS Mail, where the actual sender domain differs from the one displayed. While brand owners have already somewhat found their way to IDNs with genuine interest, and while registries and browser vendors start to deploy tools to prevent IDN abuse, support for IDNs remains challenging, which unfortunately does not encourage their uptake in the near future.
