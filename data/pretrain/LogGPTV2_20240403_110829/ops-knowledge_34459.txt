When I place a new DAG Python script in the `dags` folder, it appears as a new entry in the Airflow DAG UI, but it is not automatically enabled. Additionally, it seems that the DAG is not being loaded correctly. To enable and schedule the DAG, I have to manually click the "Refresh" button several times on the right side of the list and toggle the "On/Off" button on the left side of the list. This manual process is required even though the DAG script is already in the `dags` folder.

Is this the expected behavior in Airflow, or am I missing something?

Also, before performing these manual steps, there is an indicator next to the DAG title with the following message: "This DAG isn't available in the webserver DagBag object. It shows up in this list because the scheduler marked it as active in the metadata database."

**Assistant:**

The error message you are seeing can be misleading. If refreshing the page or restarting the Airflow webserver does not resolve the issue, it's likely that there are errors in your DAG Python script.

To diagnose and fix the problem, you can take the following steps:

1. **Check for Errors in the DAG Script:**
   - Run the command `airflow list_dags` to see if any errors are reported. This command will also list all the DAGs, and any issues with your DAG should be displayed.
   - You can also try running your DAG script as a standalone Python script to check for any syntax or logical errors.

2. **Fix the Errors:**
   - Once you identify the errors, correct them in your DAG script.

3. **Verify the Fix:**
   - After fixing the errors, the indicator should disappear, and the DAG should load and become available in the webserver DagBag object without requiring manual intervention.

If the issue persists after these steps, please provide more details about the specific errors you are encountering, and we can further assist you.
