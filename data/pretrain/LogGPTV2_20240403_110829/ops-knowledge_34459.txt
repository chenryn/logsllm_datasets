User: when I put a new DAG python script in the dags folder, I can view a new entry of DAG in the DAG UI but it was not enabled automatically. On top of that, it seems does not loaded properly as well. I can only click on the Refresh button few times on the right side of the list and toggle the on/off button on the left side of the list to be able to schedule the DAG. These are manual process as I need to trigger something even though the DAG Script was put inside the dag folder. 
Anyone can help me on this ? Did I missed something ? Or this is a correct behavior in airflow ?
By the way, as mentioned in the post title, there is an indicator with this message "This DAG isn't available in the webserver DagBag object. It shows up in this list because the scheduler marked it as active in the metdata database" tagged with the DAG title before i trigger all this manual process.
Assistant: This error can be misleading. If hitting refresh button or restarting airflow webserver doesn't fix this issue, check the DAG (python script) for errors.
Running airflow list_dags can display the DAG errors (in addition to listing out the dags) or even try running/testing your dag as a normal python script.
After fixing the error, this indicator should go away.
