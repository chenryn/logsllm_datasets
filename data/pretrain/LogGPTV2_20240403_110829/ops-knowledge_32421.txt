User: I had a problem where python was not finding modules installed by pip while in the virtualenv.
I have narrowed it down, and found that when I call python when my virtualenv in activated, it still reaches out to /usr/bin/python instead of /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python.
When I use which python in the virtualenv I get:
/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python
When I look up my $PATH variable in the virtualenv I get:
bash: /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin: No such file or directory
and yet when I actually run python it goes to /usr/bin/python
To make things more confusing to me, if I run python3.5 it grabs python3.5 from the correct directory (i.e. /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python3.5)
I have not touched /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/ in anyway. python and python3.5 are still both linked to python3 in that directory. Traversing to /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/ and running ./python, ./python3 or ./python3.5 all work normally.
I am using virtualenvwrapper if that makes a difference, however the problem seemed to occur recently, long after install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper
Assistant: On Cygwin, I still have a problem even after I created symlink to point /usr/bin/python to F:\Python27\python.exe. Here, after source env/Scripts/activate, which python is still /usr/bin/python.
After a long time, I figured out a solution. Instead of using virtualenv env, you have to use virtualenv -p F:\Python27\python.exe env even though you have created a symlink.
