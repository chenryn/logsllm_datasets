I understand that you are experiencing an issue where Python, when run within a virtual environment, is not using the expected interpreter and, as a result, cannot find modules installed via `pip`. Here's a clearer and more professional version of your description, along with a potential solution:

**Issue Description:**

I encountered a problem where Python, while inside an activated virtual environment, was unable to locate modules installed by `pip`. Upon further investigation, I discovered that even though the virtual environment is activated, running `python` still invokes `/usr/bin/python` instead of the expected `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python`.

- When I use the `which python` command in the virtual environment, it correctly points to `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python`.
- The `$PATH` variable in the virtual environment shows the correct order:
  ```
  /home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/home/liam/bin:/home/liam/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
  ```
- However, when I run `python`, it executes `/usr/bin/python` instead of the one in the virtual environment.
- Interestingly, running `python3.5` within the virtual environment correctly uses `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/python3.5`.
- Manually navigating to `/home/liam/dev/.virtualenvs/noots/bin/` and running `./python`, `./python3`, or `./python3.5` works as expected.

I am using `virtualenvwrapper`, and this issue appeared recently, long after I initially set up `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`.

**Potential Solution:**

On Cygwin, I faced a similar issue even after creating a symbolic link from `/usr/bin/python` to `F:\Python27\python.exe`. After activating the virtual environment with `source env/Scripts/activate`, `which python` still pointed to `/usr/bin/python`.

To resolve this, instead of simply using `virtualenv env`, you should specify the Python executable explicitly when creating the virtual environment. For example:

```sh
virtualenv -p F:\Python27\python.exe env
```

This ensures that the virtual environment is created with the correct Python interpreter, even if a symbolic link exists.
