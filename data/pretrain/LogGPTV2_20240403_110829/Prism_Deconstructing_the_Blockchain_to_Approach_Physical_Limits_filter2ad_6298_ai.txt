Proof. Let C be the longest chain at round r and denote the last k blocks in the chain C by C[−k] :=
[bk , bk−1, · · · , b2, b1]. Now define N ≥ k as the the least number of consecutive blocks C[−N] := [bN , bN−1, · · · , b2, b1]
s.t block bN was mined by an honest user. Let block bN be mined in round r∗. If no such block exists then bN
is the genesis block and r∗ = 0. Now consider the interval S = {i : r∗  X[r

Since the common-prefix, chain-quality and chain-growth properties are all proved assuming the event
E[r − r′, r] occurs, a natural question is how likely is its occurrence? The next lemma shows that the probability
of it occurring approaches 1 exponentially as r′ increases. This lemma will be heavily used in our analysis of
security and fast confirmation.
Lemma C.10. Let ¯f ≤ log(2−2β)
36(1 − 2β)2.
Proof. The event Ec [r − r′, r] is a union of three events. We will upper bound the probability each of these

Observe that the random variable Y [r − r′ − a, r + b] − Z [r − r′ − a, r + b] can be interpreted the position of
a 1-d random walk (starting at the origin) after r′ + a + b steps. Here Y [r − r′ − a, r + b], Z [r − r′ − a, r + b]
are the number of steps taken in right and left direction respectively. The value of ¯f is chosen s.t the random

variables Y [r − r′ − a, r + b] ∼ Bin(r′ +a +b,
the random walk has ¯f (1−2β)
positive bias per step. In this random walk analogy, event E1 [r − r′, r] implies
that the random walk is to the right of the point (1−2β) ¯f
after first r′ steps and remains to the right of that
point in all the future steps. We analyze this event by breaking in into two events.
