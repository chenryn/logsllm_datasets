User: I want to automate closing the remote desktop application using python. I open the remote desktop using mstsc. When I do
os.system("TASKKILL /F /IM mstsc.exe")
It is killing all the remote desktop applications that are open. Is there a way I can specify through python which remote desktop it has to close.
I have 2 or more instances of remote desktop open and I require my program to close only specific connection. Is there a way I can pass the IP address or process ID or something.
Assistant: To close one of the mstsc, you should know the pid of it. If you are opening mstsc.exe from a python script itself, then you could capture the pid of that instance.
p = Popen('C:\Windows\System32\mstsc.exe "connection.rdp"')
print p.pid
Then kill the exe using pid.
