/24 IP prefixes (28 in total), one anchor prefix and three IP pre-
fixes oscillating on different schedules. Beacon update intervals are
configured identically across all locations. Anchor prefixes were an-
nounced and withdrawn every two hours, the same update interval
as the RIPE Beacons, and are a control reference for propagation
behavior. To prevent filtering of the prefixes in case of route origin

validation deployment, we configured the corresponding route ob-
ject entries in both the Internet routing registry and the RPKI for
all prefixes.
We did not expect RFD configurations more strict than the vendor
default values, which already suppress 14% of all prefixes [30]. A
Juniper or Cisco router would start damping a prefix that flaps at
least every 9 or 8 minutes respectively (see Appendix B for default
values). To confirm this, we configured our Beacons with an update
interval of 15, 30, and 60 minutes in August 2019. We observed
measurable RFD for the fastest Beacon prefix (15 minutes).
After preliminary tests, we conducted two measurement cam-
paigns. In March 2020, we chose 1, 2, and 3 minutes as update
intervals during Bursts of two hours, because an update interval of
2 minutes would trigger RFD with the recommended parameters
[5, 17]. We set the Break duration to 6 hours to account for very
slowly decaying RFD penalties. If a router is configured such that
the penalty does not decay during the Break, then the updates from
next Burst will increase the penalty again, causing the router to
suppress the prefix indefinitely. In April 2020, we chose 5, 10, and
15 minutes as update intervals to cope with RFD parameters that
differ more significantly from recommended values‚Äîeither because
vendors ship deprecated default configurations, or manual adjust-
ment by operators. We configure the Break to 2 hours, because
the max-suppress-time is by default 1 hour and we did not observe
suppress phases longer than 1 hour in the Break in March. The
Burst length was still 2 hours.
In the following, we process each prefix per site separately, be-
cause they flap with different update intervals and thus belong to
independent experiments.
Validation. Validating the baseline characteristics of the injected
BGP announcements is crucial before analyzing the collected data
further. During this validation period, we statically announced all
prefixes.

Figure 7: Overlap of gathered data for RFD IP prefixes.
Figure 8: Comparison of propagation times between RIPE
Beacons and RFD anchor prefixes across all vantage points.
Our Beacon prefixes were visible at 99% or more of all vantage
points that deliver a full feed (i.e., ‚â• 700k IP prefixes) to the route
collectors (416 full feed peers in RIPE RIS and RouteViews). Surpris-
ingly, 1% of the announcements (270 million in total) included an
empty, invalid aggregator IP field. We could not find any specific
reason, though, we noticed that more than half of these announce-
ments were sent by AS 32097, a peer in the Isolario route collector
project. This may be caused by misconfigured or malfunctioning
routers. We discarded announcements with a missing or invalid
aggregator IP, because our analysis would become less accurate
without the encoded timestamps.
Our setup involves multiple sites with the aim to trigger RFD
at multiple locations. Figure 6 depicts the relative amount of links
(i.e., adjacent ASs) each site shares with any other site to the vantage
points. Between 70% and 95% of all AS links (4186 in total) in the
public BGP feeds can be observed using a single of our Beacon sites.
The median that a given link occurs on different paths, however,
is 11 paths (not shown). This is a significant increase compared to
using Beacons locations individually, which would lead to a median
of 3 paths. Hence, observing AS links from multiple angles increases
the confidence in our observations.
It is important to include diverse vantage points to enhance
visibility of ASs and links. Figure 7 clearly shows that each route
collection project contributes a substantial amount of additional
data, which is the reason why we include all three data sources in
our study.
These results underscore two advantages of our setup. First,
we can observe the behavior of an AS from multiple Beacons and
vantage points, which helps pinpointing the location of RFD and
increases confidence in our observations, as will become evident
in Section 6. Second, injecting updates from additional locations
allows us to discover additional ASs and AS links.
To further validate our infrastructure we measured the propa-
gation time, i.e., the time it takes from sending the announcement
from the Beacon routers until the first announcement of each router
reaches the vantage points. We compare the results with the propa-
gation behavior of RIPE BGP Beacons [34] in Figure 8. Both Beacon
sets show the same characteristics. It is worth noting that the prop-
agation delay depends on the collector project in use (not shown).
Some vantage points in the RouteViews project export updates
498
exactly 50 seconds after our Beacon routers sent the BGP updates.
In contrast to this, vantage points in Isolario export updates for all
but two Beacons within 30 seconds, whereas RIPE vantage points
show a much more diverse behavior.
5 IDENTIFYING RFD-ENABLED ASs
We presented a method to trigger and determine RFD paths. Now,
we pinpoint RFD deployment of specific ASs. Our Bayesian ap-
proach (¬ß 5.1) does not make any assumptions based on RFD me-
chanics, in contrast to heuristics (¬ß 5.2) that we use for comparison.
5.1 Bayesian Inferences
The output of BeCAUSe are many samples of p: an ùëÅ dimensional
distribution across ASs. As we are interested in making decisions
about each of the parameters individually, which tells us which
AS may be showing RFD, we look at the marginal distributions of
each ùëùùëñ (i.e., the distribution of each of the parameter separately).
To identify RFD-enabled ASs using BeCAUSe we must establish
distributions that are indicative of RFD.
5.1.1 Explanation of Algorithm Output. In contrast to many classifi-
cation algorithms, the output of this method are diagnostic pictures
(distributions) for each AS about its behavior. Here, we highlight
the diagnostic ability of these distributions, and describe a basic
summarisation and classification process to provide automatic in-
sights.
Figure 9 depicts the marginal distributions of 4 ASs that are
indicative of behaviors of interest.
(a) The distribution is heavily skewed with most mass at 1. There
is very little spread suggesting there is strong evidence the
AS is damping.
(b) The distribution is heavily skewed with most mass at 0. There
is almost no spread suggesting there is strong evidence that
the AS is not damping.
(c) Mass centred around mean 0.1 with comparatively higher
spread suggests contradictory information about RFD, i.e., some
paths that damp and others that don‚Äôt. In fact, AS 701 damps
inconsistently.
(d) The distribution we see here is the ùõΩ prior distribution. As
it persisted, it is likely that we did not see any meaningful

data about this AS. Interestingly, this AS is on damped paths;
nevertheless, there is already another AS on these paths that
is likely to damp, so we cannot extract any information about
this AS.
Summarising the distributions. Inferring the distributions of
5.1.2
each AS gives us flexibility in identifying ASs that are implementing
RFD. There are several methods, ranging from simple to complex
that we could use. The distributions could be summarised by taking
the average (or some other point estimate) of the distribution as
a metric. A threshold could then be used on these to determine
RFD-enabled ASs. We can also preserve some of the information
regarding the shape or spread of the distributions to use the implicit
level of certainty in our decisions. We will focus here on one possible
way of summarising the distributions with two metrics to measure
the expected value and the certainty and use these to categorise
the ASs and identify RFD.
Summary metrics. We generate 2 summaries of the distribution
for AS from each method:
‚Ä¢ The mean of the distribution; and
‚Ä¢ The Highest Posterior Density Interval (HDPI)
The first is just the average ¬Øùëùùëñ of the distribution, ùëÉ(ùëùùëñ|ùê∑), and
gives an estimate of the expected value for this AS. HDPI finds
the smallest interval that contains ùõæ = 0.95 of the mass. Otherwise
know as the smallest Bayesian credible interval, it is the interval
[ùê¥, ùêµ] where ùõæ of the mass falls between ùê¥ and ùêµ such that ùêµ ‚àí ùê¥
is minimised. The width of the HDPI measures the (asymmetric)
spread of the distribution and gives an idea of the uncertainty in
our mean estimate.
1) Categorising. The objective of the algorithm is to allow a user to
gain a specific level of certainty depending on the application. The
metrics provide us with valuable information, but for the purpose
of this work we must translate these metrics into a ‚Äôdecision‚Äô. We
maintain some of the information about certainty by mapping
results to a category from 1 to 5, where 1 and 2 are highly likely
and likely not damping and 4 and 5 are likely and highly likely
damping. Category 3 is uncertain, either because of contradictory

indicates the flag if no other category is assigned. The high-
est category is chosen for each AS.

data, or, most often, due to lack of specific data about this AS. Note
that not enough data does not necessarily mean the AS is not on
many paths. Nodes that are regularly on paths with other damping
ASs do not display any specific information. Categorisation based
on the summaries are given in Table 1.
The cut-off values are chosen to automatically implement the
insights from the output distributions in Figure 9, and we provide
data driven justification in ¬ß 6.1. After summarising and categoris-
ing both the MH and HMC distributions by mean and HDPI, we
use the highest flag.
2) Identifying ASs that use RFD inconsistently. It is evident
from the data and marginal posterior distributions that some AS
use RFD inconsistently. For example, AS 701 damps all neighbours
except AS 2497. The distribution of ùëù701 in 9(c) highlighted con-
tradictory data. After categorising based on the thresholds above,
we utilise the marginal distributions to determine ASs that damp
inconsistently.
Recall, that if the path displays RFD then there is at least one AS
on the path that damps. Therefore, there should be at least one path
on each RFD path that is labelled in Category 4 or 5. If the path
does not contain an inferred RFD AS, we use the posterior marginal
distributions to determine the AS that is most likely causing RFD.
Specifically, for each AS X on the path we determine the posterior
probability that AS X is the most likely to be causing RFD on the

P(min(ùëùùëñ for ùëñ ‚àà ùêΩ) = ùëã) > 0.8,
(8)
then there is sufficient evidence that X is the damping AS on path ùêΩ.
For each damping path ùêΩ in the data, if there is an AS that is most
likely damping we label this AS as a Category 4.
In general, the summarisation, cut-off, and flagging methods
can be tailored depending on the desired confidence level of the
outcomes. We accept Category 4 and 5 to be an RFD-enabled AS;
however, if higher certainty is required, we could use only Category
5 ASs or change the thresholds appropriately.
5.2 Passive Measurement Heuristics
An alternative to Bayesian Inference for identifying ASs that deploy
RFD is to rely on heuristics. We now present 3 metrics toward that
aim. For each AS we take the average of the metrics as the final
output. These will be used for comparison purposes to highlight
the power and simplicity of BeCAUSe. We will see that heuristics
are less precise and need tuning that is absent from the Bayesian ap-
proach. Additionally, the heuristics would become very inaccurate
if RFD was deployed in the majority of networks.
5.2.1 RFD Path Ratio. This heuristic quantifies the relative occur-
rences of an AS on a path showing the RFD signal compared to the
total number of paths this AS appears on. We calculate for each AS:
ùëÄ1(AS) =
#RFD paths (AS)
#RFD paths(ùê¥ùëÜ) + #non-RFD paths(ùê¥ùëÜ)
This metric is robust for richly connected ASs, i.e., Tier 1 provider
and transit networks. Stub ASs tend to be biased towards the RFD
configuration of their upstream provider(s). False positives will
occur for ASs, which only have one upstream with RFD enabled.
Inferring RFD ASs Based on Alternative Paths. This metric
5.2.2
is motivated by two observations. (i) damped prefixes will reveal
alternative paths between a Beacon prefix and a vantage point
because of path hunting. (ii) An AS that actively damps prefixes
will not be part of an alternative path.

distribution for each AS (x-axis) with cut-offs (Table 1) in
grey, and a measure of certainty about the estimate (y-axis)
for the 1 min update interval. ASs are colored based on the
assigned category.
For each damped path, we determine a set of alternative paths
between the Beacon and the vantage point. We expect that alter-
native paths are used more frequently after the original path has
been damped. Then, for each AS we determine the average share
of alternative paths without the AS across all damped paths.
5.2.3 Announcement Distribution across Bursts. This metric is mo-
tivated by the observation that a damping AS sends fewer BGP
updates near the end of a Burst compared to non-damping ASs.

non-RFD AS. The blue and white areas, separated by a vertical red
line, indicate the Burst and Break phases respectively. Both plots
