centroid distance loss calculated from the centroid distance
minimisation objective. The hyper parameter cw is used to
weigh contribution of the centroid distance loss to the final
loss value during training. In the experiments, the value of
cw is set to 0.25. The resulting composite loss function is
then optimised using the Adam optimiser, using default hyperparameter values from the FastAI framework.
Loss = Lossmlm + cw âˆ— Losscdist. 	(3)
