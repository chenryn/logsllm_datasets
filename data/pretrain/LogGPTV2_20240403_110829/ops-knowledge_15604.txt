User: Please list some common network security vulnerabilities and attack methods, and provide relevant defense measures and tools.
Assistant: Common network security vulnerabilities and attack methods: 1. Denial of service attack (DDoS): The attacker uses a large number of requests or traffic to paralyze the server or network resources, making normal users unable to access. Defensive measures: use DDoS protection services, set traffic restrictions or block abnormal traffic, update the system to reduce security vulnerabilities. Tools: Cloudflare, Akamai, Impervia, DDoS-Guard, etc. 2. Malware attacks: including viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, etc., which can destroy or steal data. Defensive measures: use anti-virus software, regularly update the operating system and software software patches, develop good usage habits, such as not opening unknown email attachments. Tools: Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky, AVG, etc. 3. SQL injection attack: The attacker queries or modifies data in the database by entering malicious scripts. Defensive measures: Use parameterized queries, filter user input, limit database user privileges as much as possible, and update database software in a timely manner to overcome security vulnerabilities. Tools: ModSecurity, SQLMap, Scrawlr, etc. 4. Phishing attack: Attackers obtain sensitive information of users, such as user names and passwords, by disguising themselves as legitimate websites or emails. Defensive measures: Be careful with email, use two-factor authentication, learn how to detect spoofed websites, and more. Tools: PhishingFrenzy, ReversingLabs, PhishingBox, etc. 5. Attackers use social engineering to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. Defensive measures: Be aware of confidential information, update passwords regularly, learn how to detect social engineering tactics, etc. Tools: SecureWorks, KnowBe4, Social-Engineer Toolkit, etc.
