User: According to the following business indicators, analyze the server workload in the data center and propose the best resource management solution. There are a total of 10 servers in the data center, each with the same software and applications installed. According to historical data statistics, the average workload of the server is 50%. During the peak period of business, the load will reach more than 90%. The resource management scheme currently used in the data center is as follows:\n1. All servers will automatically expand as the load increases, and once the load decreases, the number of servers will be automatically reduced. \n2. All servers share a storage pool, and applications will be evenly distributed on different servers to avoid single point of failure. \n3. All servers are connected to a network switch. The bandwidth of the switch is 1Gbps, and 80% of the bandwidth has been used so far.
Assistant: Judging from the business indicators of the data center, the data center needs a resource management solution that can cope with high loads, and can ensure the availability and stability of services during peak periods. In view of the current situation, the following optimal resource management solutions can be proposed: 1. Introduce a load balancer to distribute traffic to different servers to avoid single point of failure, and can automatically adjust according to the load of the server to ensure the server's The workload is within reason. 2. Introduce storage virtualization technology to divide the storage pool into multiple logical storages and distribute them to different servers to improve data access efficiency and reliability. 3. Increase the bandwidth on the network switch to improve bandwidth utilization, avoid network congestion, and ensure the stable operation of the data center. Through the above three optimal resource management solutions, the resource utilization rate and service availability of the data center can be effectively improved, and load balancing and resource allocation can be automatically performed during high load periods to ensure the stable operation of the data center business.
