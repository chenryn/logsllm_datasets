## Abstract
In PKC 2009, Gorantla, Boyd, and González Nieto introduced a novel security model (GBG model) for group key agreement (GKA) protocols, which better supports adversaries' queries by considering Key Compromise Impersonation (KCI) resilience. However, the GBG model does not address ephemeral key leakage attacks. In this paper, we demonstrate an ephemeral key leakage attack on an existing GKA protocol that is secure under the GBG model. We then extend the GBG model to include ephemeral key leakage as part of the adversary's capabilities. Additionally, we apply the NAXOS trick to propose an improved GKA protocol that can resist ephemeral key leakage attacks. The security of the improved protocol is analyzed under our new model.

## 1. Introduction
Recent advancements in networking, mass communication media, and digital technology have opened up extensive possibilities for group applications. Group applications, a special case of multi-party applications, involve participants with shared rights, responsibilities, and goals. Examples include digital conferences, text-based group communication, and file and data sharing. Security is a critical concern in these applications, as group members need to protect sensitive communication content from outsiders.

Group key establishment is a cryptographic protocol that enables a set of users to establish a common secret session key over a public channel. This session key can be used for subsequent cryptographic operations. Group key establishment can be divided into two classes: group key distribution (GKD) and group key agreement (GKA). In GKD, a trusted party (group manager) distributes the session key securely to group members. In contrast, GKA allows all participants to establish the session key without a designated key generator or distributor and without requiring a secure channel. This paper focuses on GKA protocols.

Several security models exist for two or three-party key agreement protocols, but the first formal security model for GKA was proposed by Bresson, Chevassut, Pointcheval, and Quisquater (BCPQ model). Subsequent models, such as the BCP, BCP+, and KS models, extended the BCPQ model to handle dynamic membership, internal state information reveal resistance, and malicious participant behavior, respectively. However, these models do not consider KCI resilience. Gorantla et al. introduced the GBG model, which includes KCI resilience, and showed that the Bohli, González-Vasco, and Steinwandt (BGS) protocol is secure under this model.

Inspired by Manulis et al.'s work, which highlighted the lack of consideration for ephemeral key leakage in GKA security models, we extend the GBG model to include ephemeral key leakage. Our new model allows the adversary to reveal any long-term and ephemeral keys of participants, except for one participant in the test session. We also improve the BGS protocol to resist ephemeral key leakage attacks using the NAXOS trick. Our contributions are:

1. A stronger security model for GKA protocols, providing the adversary with more attack capabilities.
2. An attack on the BGS protocol and its improvement.
3. A straightforward security proof for the improved BGS protocol under well-studied assumptions.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the GBG model and discusses an ephemeral key leakage attack on the BGS protocol. Section 3 introduces our extended GBG model. Section 4 presents the improved BGS protocol, and Section 5 provides the formal security argument.

## 2. The GBG Model and the BGS Protocol
### 2.1 Overview of the GBG Model
The GBG model provides a formal security assurance for GKA protocols. It defines participants, adversarial capabilities, and security notions. Participants run multiple sessions with peers, establishing session keys. The model assumes a fully controlled network by an adversary who can eavesdrop, delay, alter, and insert messages. The adversary can make various queries, including `Execute`, `Send`, `RevealKey`, `Corrupt`, `RevealState`, and `Test`.

### 2.2 Ephemeral Key Leakage Attack on the BGS Protocol
The BGS protocol, proven secure under the GBG model, is vulnerable to ephemeral key leakage attacks. We demonstrate this attack and show how it can be mitigated by modifying the protocol to use the NAXOS trick, which involves generating the ephemeral secret result using a hash function of the long-term key and the ephemeral key.

## 3. Extended GBG Model
We extend the GBG model to include ephemeral key leakage. In our new model, the adversary can reveal any long-term and ephemeral keys of participants, except for one participant in the test session. This extension enhances the security model by considering a broader range of potential attacks.

## 4. Improved BGS Protocol
We present an improved version of the BGS protocol that resists ephemeral key leakage attacks. The improvement involves using the NAXOS trick to generate the ephemeral secret result, ensuring that even if the ephemeral key is leaked, the session key remains secure.

## 5. Security Proof
Under well-studied assumptions, we provide a formal security proof for the improved BGS protocol. The proof demonstrates that the protocol is secure in our new model, even in the presence of ephemeral key leakage.

This structured approach ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the presentation of the research.
