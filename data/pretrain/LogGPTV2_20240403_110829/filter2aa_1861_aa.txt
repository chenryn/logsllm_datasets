Predicting Susceptibility to 
Social Bots on Twitter
Chris Sumner & Dr. Randall Wald
PI:EMAIL & PI:EMAIL
Welcome to ‘Predicting Susceptibility to Social 
Bots on Twitter’. I’m Chris Sumner, 
representing the Online Privacy Foundation and 
I’m joined by Dr. Randall Wald from Florida 
Atlantic University. 
The Online Privacy Foundation is a non-profit, 
charitable organisation, currently focused on 
understanding what people might be giving 
away via social networks without their 
knowledge.

Before we begin, I want to make sure people 
have the chance to decide whether this talk is 
really for them

If you’re familiar with these names/terms, you 
may find the first half of this presentation a 
little on the light/introductory side. 
Slide 3 
Contains some maths…
We also talk about Statistics and Machine 
Learning (sometimes referred to as  Predictive 
Analytics). We’ll keep this to a minimum, but 
ensure the slide notes contain more detail.  
We’ll also include some hidden slides in the 
hand-outs which provide more details. 
So… on to the talk… 
Slide 4 
It’s only fitting, since we’re in Las Vegas, that 
we talk about odds. 
Slide 5 
Goal = Improve the odds
The goal of our work was to see if we could 
improve the odds of finding users more likely to 
respond to a relatively crude twitter bot… 
While it would be interesting, we never 
expected to be able to predict susceptibility 
with laser like accuracy.  
“Predictions need not be accurate to score big 
value” (page 10 - Book. Predictive analytics – 
The power to predict who will click, buy, lie or 
die’ – Eric Siegel)  
Ref: 
Siegel, E. 2013. Predictive analytics. Hoboken, 
N.J.: Wiley. 
Slide 6 
Goal = Improve the odds
I want to be up front that you might not find 
the improvements we reach that exciting. To 
those with an interest in machine 
learning/prediction, the results should remain 
of interest. 
Slide 7 
Anyone know who this guy is?.... It’s Tim 
Hwang….  
Slide 8 
And back in early 2011 I’d stumbled upon this 
fascinating and amusing competition which he 
hosted with the Web Ecology Project… 
….it was described as…

This is what the winning bot did…. 
• Created a lead bot called @JamesMTitus 
• Instantly go out and follow all 500 of the 
target users 
• every 2-3 hours, tweet something from a 
random list of messages. 
• constantly scan flickr for pictures of "cute 
cats" from the Cute Cats group and blog 
them to James' blog "Kitteh Fashun" - 
(which auto tweets to James' twitter 
timeline) 
• 4 secondary bots following the network of 
the 500 users and the followers of the 
targets to test for follow backs (and then 
getting James to follow those that followed 
back, once per day) - we believed that 
expanding our own network across mutual 
followers of the 500 would increase our 
likely hood of being noticed (through 
retweets or what have you from those who 
were not in the target set. 
Slide 9 
3 teams took part and were given those same 
500 unsuspecting users to target.  
Slide 10 
…the 500 targets all had a common 
interest/fondness in cats (the animals, not the 
musical) 
Slide 11 
+1     Mutual Follow
+3    Social Response
-15   Killed by Twitter
The teams gained 1 point for a follow back, 3 
points for some response and they lost 
15points if they got killed by Twitter 
(suspended) 
Slide 12 
“It’s blood sport for internet social 
science/network analysis nerds.”
….It was described as  ‘blood sport of internet

Slide 14 
To date, most research has focused on how to 
identify bots, but less research has looked… 
Slide 15 
…the other side of the question – detecting 
users likely to be fooled by bots, something 
which is important in helping raise awareness 
and seek solutions.…. 
This point was raised by Yazan Boshmaf in the 
paper ‘Design and Analysis of a Social Botnet’ 
http://lersse-
dl.ece.ubc.ca/record/277/files/COMNET_Social
bots_2012.pdf  
We cover this later in the deck, but here’s the 
quote from the paper for those reading along 
“To this end, we are currently investigating two 
directions from the defense side. The first 
involves understanding the factors that 
influence user decisions on befriending 
strangers, which is useful in designing user-
centered security controls that better 
communicate the risks of online threats” 
Slide 16 
…So while we were conducting our 2012 study 
into Twitter usage and the Dark Triad of 
personality, we figured we’d incorporate a side 
project to look at social bots and, as an 
organization, attempt to answer couple of 
questions….

G, J. (2012). Predicting Dark Triad Personality 
Traits from Twitter usage and a linguistic 
analysis of Tweets, 11th IEEE International 
Conference on Machine Learning and 
Applications, 2012, pp. 386-393

Slide 17 
Are some users more naturally 
predisposed to interacting with 
social bots?
i.e. Are some users more naturally predisposed 
to interacting with social bots (you could argue 
Strangers) than others? Does personality play a 
part? 
Slide 18 
Is it possible to increase the 
odds of getting a response 
from a twitter user?
…and is it possible that social bot creators 
could use machine learning to better target 
users who are more likely to response.   
Slide 19 
….thereby (the thinking goes) reducing the 
chances of landing in Twitter Jail (account 
suspension). 
Slide 20 
Who cares?
The obvious question is… “Who cares?”.  we’ll 
look at these in greater depth during the talk, 
but the next 5 slides provide a high-level 
summary. Starting with… 
Slide 21 
#1
#1. Marketeers: Marketeers who are looking to 
get a higher klout (kred etc) score for the brand 
they’re representing, might be able to focus on 
users who are more likely to interact (or 
engage) with them. This might be a useful 
strategy for the early stages of building a brand 
(fake or otherwise), but it could also mean that 
some users are deluged with far more spam 
than others.  
.. Initially (some, not all) marketeers and 
blackhat SEO folks wanted your ‘likes’, but 
since that doesn’t necessarily translate to a 
purchase (because that was easy to game with 
bots), they’re being requested to create 
‘engagement’.  Social bots present an obvious 
evolution. 
Slide 22 
#2
Propagandists
#2. Propagandists, AstroTurfers and their ilk: 
Finding users who are most likely to help 
propagate your message or at the very least, 
give credence to the bot account. 
Slide 23 
#3
Social Engineers
#3. Social Engineering Assignments: Since the 
most predictive features (klout score, number 
of friends/follows) are easily obtained through 
API calls, this makes it very easy to build/model 
in Maltego (or similar tools).  Here we can see 
@Alice’s imaginary Twitter friends. A simple 
Maltego local-transform could be used to flag 
users who are more likely to engage in 
conversation, which might prove use for Social 
Engineers looking for weaker points in a social 
graph. E.g. You know the Twitter accounts of 
users in ‘Acme Corp’ and want to highlight the 
ones who maybe most likely to talk to you. The 
red icons are the users to focus on.   
One approach here would be to build one or 
more trust relationships with the “red” users 
before convincing the target to accept an email 
from you with malicious content.   In this 
scenario, it seems that it would make sense to 
generate less noise and focus on the users 
where the odds of a reply are better.

2013 paper by Erhardt Graeff
What We Should Do Before the 
Social Bots Take Over:
Online Privacy Protection and the 
Political Economy of Our Near Future
“
”
The privacy implications are nicely described in 
this recent paper by Erhardt Greaff. 
http://web.mit.edu/comm-
forum/mit8/papers/Graeff-SocialBotsPrivacy-
MIT8.pdf  
Greaff, E. 2013. "What We Should Do Before 
the Social Bots Take Over", paper presented at 
Media in Transition 8, Cambridge, MA, May 3-
5. 
Specifically… 
“Consider a hypothetical internet startup that 
sells widgets. They decide to employ social bots 
to interact online with likely buyers of widgets. 
The bots are part of an advertising strategy 
that human public relations employees already 
use on social media Platforms — they attempt 
to create real relationships with users on a 
network in order to better understand their 
customer base and engender brand awareness 
and loyalty. Users may or may not be aware of 
the fact that they are interacting with a bot, 
but the conversation and relationship is 
continuous because the bot is always available 
and responsive. As the relationship between the 
social bot and the user matures, the 
conversation might span both public and 
private social media spaces (such as Twitter’s 
direct messages), wherein a user might expect 
a greater degree of privacy or discretion from a 
human interlocutor. However, the bot may not 
acknowledge the nuances of such social norms 
and ethics; moreover, the company that runs 
the bot is collecting all of this data. While it’s 
feasible that a human or team of humans could 
undertake such an advertising strategy on 
behalf of a company, it’s unlikely to scale to the 
number of relationships necessary to make it 
cost effective. This poses no challenge to a 
social bot, which has perfect memory and 
requires no sleep or overtime pay. An unlimited 
number of relationships could be maintained 
through a social bot with the level of 
responsiveness necessary to produce intimate 
connections. The better the machine learning 
algorithms powering a social bot’s artificial 
intelligence the more data they can process and 
use to improve their social interactions. This 
means the potential creation of more intimate 
interactions based on historical data collected 
from you or from others in your friend network, 
including discussions of personal 
relationships—significant others and kids, work 
or life complaints and concerns, and hobbies 
(both conventional or embarrassing — the bot 
will simply meet you where you are at and 
affirm you). Extracted personal data can also 
go beyond text if you share personal 
photographs and videos or link to those that 
you like; there are also data that may be 
invisible during social interactions with bots but 
which they are aware of: time, location (GPS 
data from mobile phones or IP addresses of 
networked computers), and even purchase 
records, depending on what corporation or 
even data sharing consortium the bot is 
affiliated with”

..Conversely, existing social media sites are getting much 
better at detecting bots so part of an effective bot strategy 
is reducing the chances of ending up in Twitter jail.

“A social bot is a piece of software 
that controls a user account in an 
online social network and passes 
itself of as a human” 
(Wagner et al)
Wagner et al (2012)” 
Wagner et al define Social Bots as “a piece of 
software that controls a user account in an 
online social network and passes itself of as a 
human”. This is a useful working definition for 
us.

The Sybil Attack (2002)
John R. Douceur
Microsoft Research
You may also hear Social Bots referred to as 
Sybils  
Although not quite in the same context, John 
Doucer at Microsoft Research used “Sybils” in 
his 2002 papr, ‘The Sybil Attack’

Slide 31 
Bots aren’t new, Chatterbots featured in 
research around 1994 (probably earlier). In this 
talk we’re really examining bots in social media, 
which for the sake of argument, we’ll split into 
1st Generation and 2nd Generation bots…

Early bots tend to be all about making you look 
popular (with fake followers). These are still 
hugely popular and according to a recent NY 
Times article, remain a lucrative business, but 
ultimately they’re pretty dumb.

prevalent today. 
Slide 37 
In 2008 we see the first (Publicly at least) 
manifestation of a smarter social bot on 
Twitter.  Project Realboy plays with the concept 
of creating more believable bots.   
This is around the same time that Hamiel and 
Moyer shared their BlackHat and DefCon talk 
“Satan Is On My Friends List” highlighting that 
some of your social media friends may be 
imposters.  We saw another example of that in 
the 2010  ‘Robin Sage’ talk at Blackhat.
