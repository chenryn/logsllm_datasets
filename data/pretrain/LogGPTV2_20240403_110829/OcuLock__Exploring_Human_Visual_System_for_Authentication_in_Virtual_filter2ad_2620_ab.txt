with the most probable feature values and then attempt
the authentication with a higher chance of success.
This can be done by observing the enrolled owners and
identifying a similar population, e.g., college students.
Then the attacker can let a target population attempt
the HMD authentication and collect a dataset of EOG

signals for record forgery. The forged record can be
fed to the VR HMD by connecting a voltage generator
or injecting the signal to the authentication code.
C. Design Goal
To protect the VR HMD in the above scenario, OcuLock
has the following design goals.
•
•
•
Secure: OcuLock must be resistant
to all of our
proposed attacks from adversaries when the HMD is
left unattended or stolen.
Reliable: OcuLock must have small error rates to
prevent unauthorized access. The performance should
keep stable overtime to avoid the frequent update of
authentication biometric.
Usable: The authentication process must be fast and
simple. The users should not wear additional sensing
devices besides the HMD. No credentials should be
memorized.
IV. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
In this section, we overview the proposed OcuLock system
and its authentication protocol. As depicted in Figure 3,
OcuLock is comprised of an EOG-based HVS sensing frame-
work and a record-comparison driven authentication scheme.
When a user claims her identity and attempts to access the
HMD, OcuLock renders VR visual stimuli on the screen. The
visual stimuli are designed to trigger unique HVS activities for
VR authentication. While the user is viewing the VR scene,
EOG signals are acquired through electrodes embedded in the
HMD. Various types of noise are ﬁltered during the acquisition
to generate clean EOG signals.
Next, the EOG signal will be analyzed to detect key HVS
activities such as eye globe and eyelid movement by using
wavelet domain analysis. As a result, a trace of HVS activities
manifesting various features is produced. Finally, based on the
derived trace of HVS activities, the clean EOG is re-examined
to extract the biostructure and behavior features of HVS. The
extracted feature vector of the current attempt is compared
with that of the claimed owner. The comparison result for
each feature is fed to a machine learning model to determine
whether the current attempt is from the owner or an attacker.
V. EOG-BASED HVS SENSING
In this section, we introduce the EOG-based HVS sensing
framework proposed by OcuLock. Speciﬁcally, we design
visual stimuli to trigger EOG response in VR and then collect
clean EOG signals manifesting distinctive HVS characteristics.
A. Visual Stimuli Design
1) Design Principle: Without proper stimulation, users’
eye movement may be minimal and some HVS characteristics,
e.g., the extent of eye globe rotation, may not be manifested.
Hence, it is important to design visual stimuli to trigger desired
HVS activities.
In consideration of usability, it is important to keep the
stimuli simple and intuitive so that no special efforts are
required. The only instruction for OcuLock’s users is that
they follow moving objects using their eyes. Users need not
memorize any types of credentials during the authentication.
They also do not need to wear extra hardware or take off the
HMD. This level of user efforts is minimal and is consistent
with existing authentication methods, such as speaking for
voice recognition and typing passwords.
The procedure of stimuli design is as follows. First, three
typical types of eye behavior that trigger eye globe/eyelid-
level and cell/nerve-level HVS activities were identiﬁed [47]:
ﬁxed-trajectory movement, free exploration, and involuntary
micro-saccades. Second, to elicit the behavior, we designed
Fixed-Route, City-Street, and Illusion, respectively, in a 2D
image form. Third, to exploit the powerful graphic rendering
techniques in VR, the 2D stimuli were converted to 3D.
All visual stimuli are displayed on the main viewport that
human eyes face when the HMD is put on. The viewing range
of the viewport is 90 degrees from left to right and 60 degrees
from top to bottom. Such a setting allows users to view all
elements of the stimuli by only rotating their eyes without the
need for head navigation [25]. The visual stimuli should also
elicit distinctive HVS responses so that OcuLock is able to
discover the uniqueness of each user in VR.
2) Visual Stimuli: We design three types of visual stimuli to
investigate their impacts on authentication results. In the Fixed-
Route stimulus (Figure 4a), we follow the principle of simplic-
ity and present a 3D spherical red ball changing positions step
by step from left to right and then from top to bottom in a
ﬁxed trajectory. The ball stays at each intermediate positions
for a given time interval. We aim to study if such a simple
stimulus can trigger enough HVS response for authentication.

two are dynamic.

By responding to this stimulus, all users will have almost the
same scanpath. However, the micro-saccades determined by
extraocular muscles [8] could be different among users. Since
the ball moves from one end of the viewport to the other, it
forces the user to rotate her eye globe as much as possible to
track the ball. The extent of eye rotation distance depending on
the eye globe size and shape is then triggered and collected in
EOG signals. As users also blink during the session, it provides
an opportunity to observe the extent and strength of eyelid
action [1]. Furthermore, the above eye response is triggered
along with low-level cell and nerve activities. Therefore, HVS
characteristics such as metabolism intensity and sympathetic
signal energy would be reﬂected.
The City-Street stimulus (Figure 4b) is a 3D model of a
street containing diverse elements such as buildings, vehicles,
billboards, and cranes. We aim to investigate how users re-
spond to static objects in a VR scene through this stimulus.
Since all objects are static, users will not follow any moving
objects. Instead, they will explore the VR scene freely. The
scanpath thus reﬂects the unique viewing interests and habits
of a user [41]. Similar to Fixed-Route, the low-level HVS
signals from cells and muscles can be triggered by the user’s
movement.
Finally,
the Illusion stimulus (Figure 4c) contains nine
spinning vortexes, among which one special vortex is growing
larger and shrunk to its original size within a short
time
interval. Each vortex takes turns to become the special one in a
ﬁxed order (from left to right and top to down). By following
the expansion and shrinkage of the spinning vortexes, users
present a ﬁxed scanpath but different low-level HVS data
as in Fixed-Route. The physiological features of eye globe
rotation can also be triggered since the vortexes cover the
entire viewport. Moreover, since spinning vortexes elicit more
micro-saccades and blinks [8], this visual stimulus is designed
to characterize ﬁne-grained HVS actions and more cell and
muscle activities.
The beneﬁt of the three visual stimuli is that they are
designed to trigger a set of physiological and behavioral
features of HVS. It is unlikely for adversaries to forge an
EOG record containing both similar scanpath and extensive
low-level HVS information.
B. EOG Signal Acquisition
1) Hardware Setup: We propose to measure the low-level
HVS activities through EOG [5]. By attaching thin electrodes
on the face cover of HMD and placing them in the appropriate
Fig. 6: The frequency domain of raw EOG signals. Various
types of noise can be removed by ﬁlters.
positions near eye sockets as shown in Figure 5, EOG measures
the electric voltage variance around eye areas. As shown in
the ﬁgure, we attach two electrodes to the outer edges of
eyes to collect the horizontal voltage variance and another two
electrodes to the upper and lower part of the right eye to collect
the vertical voltage variance. One more electrode is attached
to the forehead for signal reference.
We measure the variance detected by the two groups of
electrodes at a sampling rate of 200 Hz through two channels.
Each channel is equipped with an adapter which integrates
the voltage variance detected by electrodes into electrical
signals. The electrical signals are then digitized and the raw
EOG signals representing horizontal and vertical variance are
generated.
The proposed EOG-based sensing enables the measurement
of HVS signals that are otherwise unavailable in previous
systems capturing high-level eye gaze patterns. Due to the
miniature nature of electrodes, users will not be burdened
by the weight of the extra hardware. In fact, EOG sensors
have been embedded in commercial smart glasses, e.g., JINS
MEME, to sense eye activities [32]. More importantly, the
collected EOG signal is a time series that can be processed
and analyzed without high computation overhead.
2) Noise Removal: After the raw signals are collected,
OcuLock removes various types of interference from the
horizontal and vertical EOG and generate two clean signal
components, EOGh and EOGv, for further authentication
analysis. The measured raw electrical signals contain DC bias,
power-line interference, and electricity generated by neurons
and muscles when subjects move their head and body during
EOG collection. As illustrated in Figure 6, since each type
of noise is of a speciﬁc frequency, we remove them using

ﬁlters. The DC bias has a frequency lower than 0.05 Hz. The
frequency of power-line interference is around 60 Hz. As for
noise from head and body movement, its frequency is much
higher than the frequency bands of EOG signals that is between
0 to 35 Hz. Therefore, OcuLock applies a bandpass ﬁlter to
pass frequencies between 0.05 and 35 Hz.
3) Sample EOG Data: In order to validate the feasibility
of EOG-based HVS sensing, we conducted a pilot study to
investigate the EOG of different VR users. To obtain EOG
signals containing enough information, we carried out two
experiments with the Fixed-Route and City-Street stimuli,
respectively. The detailed experiment setup is consistent with
the main evaluation and will be elaborated in Section VII.
We show the noise-removed horizontal EOG, EOGh, and
vertical EOG, EOGv, of two users in Figure 7. It can be seen
that the EOG signals of user X and user Y are signiﬁcantly
different for both experiments in terms of both horizontal and
vertical EOG. Since we set users’ right side as the positive
pole for EOGh, a positive EOGh indicates users are looking
to their right. Similarly, a positive EOGv implies eyes looking
up. As shown in Figure 7a and 7b, users’ EOG signals achieve
a similar ﬂuctuation trend but present distinct details in the
ﬁrst experiment. This is because users followed an identical
scanpath while viewing the Fixed-Route. However, as EOG
is also impacted by other HVS interaction and biostructure,
the signals still present an obvious difference. For example,
different size of eye globe results in the different magnitude
of EOG when gazing at the same location. For the City-Street
(Figure 7c and 7d), users’ scanpath becomes different due to
the free exploration and their different areas of interest, which
makes the EOG signals more distinct. As we will show in
Section VI-B, in addition to the movements of eye globe that
are straightforward to visualize using the EOG, there are other
important features that can be extracted from the temporal
and frequency domain of EOG signals to characterize HVS

activities and biostructure.
VI. RECORD-COMPARISON DRIVEN AUTHENTICATION
In this section, we introduce the record-comparison driven
authentication scheme of OcuLock. In particular, OcuLock
ﬁrst analyzes the clean EOG to recognize a trace of HVS
activities including saccades, ﬁxations, and blinks. OcuLock
then extracts HVS physiological and behavioral features from
the clean EOG by utilizing the activity trace and compare the
input with the owner’s record for authentication decisions.
A. EOG Signal Processing
1) Saccade and Fixation Recognition: As discussed in Sec-
tion II-A, saccades and ﬁxations are the two basic movements
of eye globe that manifest many behavioral and physiological
HVS features. In OcuLock, we employ a wavelet transform
based algorithm to detect saccades and ﬁxations in order to
assist the feature extraction. This algorithm is transplanted
from a prior study [5]. It can easily identify a signal segment
of speciﬁc shape and has been shown to achieve good perfor-
mance on eye movements recognition. A wavelet-transformed
EOG signal is shown in Figure 8. The segments of high EOG
changing rate (high eye rotation speed) appear as peaks or
valleys in the transformed signal. By applying a threshold thsd
(horizontal red dashed lines) and removing segments shorter
than 10 ms [11], saccades can be detected (marked with “S”).
Similarly, all segments between the thresholds thsd and −thsd
and longer than 100 ms are marked as ﬁxations [31] (“F”).
To optimize the threshold thsd for our implementation, we
collected the ground truth of saccade and ﬁxation for 50 EOG
records from 5 users and tested the algorithm performance
under varying thsd. By following the methodology in [5],
we inspected the EOG visually and identiﬁed 698 horizon-
tal saccades and 774 vertical saccades as the ground truth.
To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, we compare the
saccades recognized by the algorithm with the ground truth
and calculate F1 Score deﬁned as follows,
T P
T P +F P ∗
T P +F P + T P

(1)
where T P , F P , and F N are the number of true positive,
false positive and false negative, respectively. We investigate
the accuracy with the threshold varying from 0.01 to 0.05 in
