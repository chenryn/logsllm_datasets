create partition efi
Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Creates an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) system partition on a GUID Partition Table (gpt) disk on Itanium-based computers. After the partition is created, the focus is given to the new partition.
Note
A gpt disk must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the select disk command to select a disk and shift the focus to it.
Syntax
create partition efi [size=] [offset=] [noerr]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
size=
The size of the partition in megabytes (MB). If no size is given, the partition continues until there is no more free space in the current region.
offset=
The offset in kilobytes (KB), at which the partition is created. If no offset is given, the partition is placed in the first disk extent that is large enough to hold it.
noerr
For scripting only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart continues to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error causes DiskPart to exit with an error code.
Remarks
You must add at least one volume with the add volume command before you can use the create command.
After you run the create command, you can use the exec command to run a duplication script for backup from the shadow copy.
You can use the begin backup command to specify a full backup, rather than a copy backup.
Examples
To create an EFI partition of 1000 megabytes on the selected disk, type:
create partition efi size=1000
