### Creating an EFI System Partition

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
This command creates an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) system partition on a GUID Partition Table (GPT) disk. The operation is specifically designed for Itanium-based computers. Once the partition is created, the focus shifts to the new partition.

**Note:**
- A GPT disk must be selected for this operation to succeed. Use the `select disk` command to select the appropriate disk and shift the focus to it.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
create partition efi [size=<size>] [offset=<offset>] [noerr]
```

**Parameters:**

- **size=** (Optional)
  - Specifies the size of the partition in megabytes (MB). If no size is provided, the partition will continue until there is no more free space in the current region.
  
- **offset=** (Optional)
  - Specifies the offset in kilobytes (KB) at which the partition is created. If no offset is provided, the partition will be placed in the first available extent that is large enough to hold it.
  
- **noerr** (Optional)
  - For scripting purposes only. When an error is encountered, DiskPart will continue to process commands as if the error did not occur. Without this parameter, an error will cause DiskPart to exit with an error code.

**Remarks:**
- You must add at least one volume using the `add volume` command before you can use the `create` command.
- After running the `create` command, you can use the `exec` command to run a duplication script for backup from the shadow copy.
- Use the `begin backup` command to specify a full backup, rather than a copy backup.

**Examples:**

- To create an EFI partition of 1000 megabytes on the selected disk, type:
  ```plaintext
  create partition efi size=1000
  ```

This command will create an EFI system partition of 1000 MB on the currently selected GPT disk.
