Question: A penetration tester is evaluating the security of a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system. Which of the following methods could an adversary potentially use to compromise the system, and what would be the likely outcome of such an action?
"A": "Installing a keylogger to capture smart card pins, allowing the adversary to proxy authentication using the compromised system.",
"B": "Changing Windows Registry keys to disable MFA, granting unlimited access without the need for further authentication.",
"C": "Intercepting SMS-based one-time codes by compromising the messaging service, bypassing the need for the second factor.",
"D": "Physically tampering with the smart card reader hardware to bypass the card's security features and gain direct system access."
Answer: AC
