Selecting certain columns from certain SQL queries frequently returns the
following error: `Unknown exception: Cannot coerce[java.util.ArrayList] to
VARCHAR`
Which columns/queries that are affected seems to be non-deterministic, though
I can always make a given query work by excluding particular columns. Eg. for
one query, I cannot select column X without having an error returned, but for
a different query I cannot select column Y. Sometimes a query can work for
some time, and then start failing, despite pulling in the exact same set of
data. In the case of this error, the columns in question seem to be always
empty (determined by cross-referencing the column/query in question over the
JSON query API).
Doing a `select *` very frequently returns this error for me.
