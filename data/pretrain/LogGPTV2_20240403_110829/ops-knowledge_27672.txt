 0 04:40:54 Info 0000000d Creating NT transaction (seq 2), objectname [6]"(null)"
 1 04:30:31 Info 00000005 Creating NT transaction (seq 1), objectname [6]"(null)"
 2 00:00:46 Info 00000005 Creating NT transaction (seq 1), objectname [6]"(null)"
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?
