†A value in bold green (e.g., the leftmost 0.027) means that: it is
a success-rate under a given guess number (resp. 101) against a
Chinese dataset (resp. Dodonew) and is greater than that of its
English counterpart (resp. Yahoo). A value in bold blue is on the
contrary: it is a guessing success-rate against a English dataset and
greater than that of its Chinese counterpart.
∗For both PCFG- and Markov-based attacks, the training set is
Duowan 1M for each Chinese test set and Rockyou 1M for English
test sets. Here the Markov setups are from Scenario#1 in Table 8.
Other Markov scenarios show the same trends.
Markov
when the guess number allowed is over 104, Chinese
web passwords are generally stronger than their English
counterparts. For example, at 106 guesses, the success
rate against Tianya, Dodonew and CSDN is 38.2%,
20.4% and 25.4%, respectively, while their English coun-
terparts is 38.6%, 24.8% and 32.3%, respectively.
As summarized in Table 9, for both PCFG and Markov
attacks, the cracking success-rates against Chinese pass-
words are always higher than those of English passwords
when the guess number is below 104, while this trend
is reversed when the guess number is above 104. Here
we mainly use order-4 Markov attacks (see Figs. 6(b)
and 6(e)) as an example, and the other Markov setup
scenarios all show the same trends.
Summary. Both PCFG- and Markov-based cracking re-
sults reveal the bifacial-security nature of Chinese pass-
words: They are more prone to online guessing as
compared to English passwords; But out of the re-
maining Chinese passwords, they are more secure a-
gainst ofﬂine guessing. This reconciles the conﬂicting
claims made in [7, 26, 34]. Alarmingly high crack-
ing rates (40%∼50%) highlight the urgency of devel-
oping defense-in-depth countermeasures (e.g., cracking-
resistant honeywords [31] and password-hardening ser-
vices [33]) to alleviate the situation. We provide a large-
scale empirical evidence for the hypothesis raised by
the HCI community [17, 46]: users rationally choose
stronger passwords for accounts with higher value.
