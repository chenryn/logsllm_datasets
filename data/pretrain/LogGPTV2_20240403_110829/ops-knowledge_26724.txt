User: I installed Python through MacPorts, and then changed the path to that one.
/opt/local/bin/python
using this command 
sudo port select python python27
But now i want to revert to the Mac one at this path
/usr/bin/python
How can I go about doing this?
EDIT:
I uninstalled the MacPort Python, restarted the terminal and everything went back to normal. Strange. But I sill don't know why/how.
Assistant: The sudo port select command only switches what /usr/local/bin/python points to, and does not touch the /usr/bin/python path at all.
The /usr/bin/python executable is still the default Apple install. Your $PATH variable may still look in /usr/local/bin before /usr/bin though when you type in python at your Terminal prompt.
