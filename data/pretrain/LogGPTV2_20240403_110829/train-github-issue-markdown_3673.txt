The present update API has option to upsert document when it does not exist.
The result is something like:  
{"ok":true,"_index":"metadata","_type":"load","_id":"ind1","_version":1}
It does not tell us whether the document existed, or was upserted or fields
were updated. If in the result we can have the following tunable via the
update api:
  * Difference between old and new values
  * Whether document was upserted or updated
  * List of fields that were updated, or that existed before
I'm not sure if this feature could be implemented as a plugin or by some other
way.
