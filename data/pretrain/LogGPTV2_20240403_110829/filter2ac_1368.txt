### Title: Reversing a Japanese Wireless SD Card - From Zero to Code Execution

**Abstract:**

Toshiba FlashAir wireless SD cards are popular among photographers and IoT enthusiasts. These cards integrate both a Japanese System on Chip (SoC) and a proprietary Japanese Operating System (OS). Prior to this project, these components had not been extensively discussed in security conferences, nor were they clearly identified.

The SoC, which is also used in embedded devices and the automotive industry, features an Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that resembles MIPS but includes unique instructions such as specialized loop constructs. The OS implements a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) specification, which, according to a survey by its designers, is believed to represent 60% of the embedded OSes currently deployed.

This talk will detail the investigative process that led to the discovery of the architecture and the operating system, starting from nearly zero knowledge about the card. The investigation was conducted using only open-source tools: miasm2 for assembly, disassembly, and emulation, and radare2 as the interface for firmware analysis. Additionally, specific tools developed during the project will be released after the talk.

The methodology and steps taken to achieve code execution on the card will be presented in detail. The process involved reading assembly code and accessing online documentation in both English and Japanese. The primary goal is to share the lessons learned and the mistakes made during the project.

Finally, a complete demonstration of code execution on the FlashAir card will be provided.

**Key Points:**
- **Investigation Tools:** Open-source tools (miasm2, radare2)
- **Methodology:** Detailed steps from zero knowledge to code execution
- **Documentation:** Utilization of English and Japanese resources
- **Outcome:** Successful code execution and tool release

This presentation aims to provide valuable insights and practical knowledge for those interested in reverse engineering and embedded systems security.
