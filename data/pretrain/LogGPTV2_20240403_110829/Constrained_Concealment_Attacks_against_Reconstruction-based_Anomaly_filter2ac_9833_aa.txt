## Abstract

Reconstruction-based anomaly detection has recently been proposed as an effective technique for detecting attacks in dynamic industrial control networks. Unlike traditional network anomaly detectors, which monitor network traffic, reconstruction-based detectors analyze sensor data using physical process models learned a priori.

In this work, we investigate various methods to evade prior reconstruction-based anomaly detectors by manipulating sensor data to conceal the attack. We find that replay attacks, often considered highly effective, perform poorly (increasing the number of alarms) when the attacker is limited to manipulating less than 95% of all features, as hidden correlations between features are not well replicated. To address this, we propose two novel attacks that manipulate a subset of sensor readings, leveraging the learned physical constraints of the system. Our attacks involve two different attacker models: a white-box attacker, which uses an optimization approach with a detection oracle, and a black-box attacker, which uses an autoencoder to transform anomalous data into normal data.

We evaluate our implementation on two datasets from the water distribution domain. The results show that the detector's recall drops from 0.68 to 0.12 by manipulating only 4 out of 82 sensors in the WADI dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that our black-box attacks are transferable to other detectors, including those based on autoencoders, LSTMs, and CNNs. Finally, we implement and demonstrate our attacks on a real industrial testbed to showcase their feasibility in real-time.

## 1 Introduction

Modern computational and physical infrastructures are increasingly interconnected. Computers, communication networks, sensors, and actuators enable the control of physical processes, forming what are known as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Examples of such systems include critical industrial control systems (ICS) like power grids, water supply systems, and autonomous vehicles.

Integrating modern security features into existing ICS is challenging due to the need for backward compatibility with legacy devices that do not support authentication or encryption. Consequently, attackers with the goal of damaging the process and local access to the network are typically assumed to be capable of eavesdropping on traffic and sending malicious commands.
