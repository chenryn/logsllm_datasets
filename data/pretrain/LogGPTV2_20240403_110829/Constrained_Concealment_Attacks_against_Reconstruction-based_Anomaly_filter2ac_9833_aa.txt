ABSTRACT
Recently, reconstruction-based anomaly detection was proposed
as an effective technique to detect attacks in dynamic industrial
control networks. Unlike classical network anomaly detectors that
observe the network traffic, reconstruction-based detectors operate
on the measured sensor data, leveraging physical process models
learned a priori.
In this work, we investigate different approaches to evade prior-
work reconstruction-based anomaly detectors by manipulating sen-
sor data so that the attack is concealed. We find that replay attacks
(commonly assumed to be very strong) show bad performance (i.e.,
increasing the number of alarms) if the attacker is constrained to
manipulate less than 95% of all features in the system, as hidden
correlations between the features are not replicated well. To ad-
dress this, we propose two novel attacks that manipulate a subset
of the sensor readings, leveraging learned physical constraints of
the system. Our attacks feature two different attacker models: A
white box attacker, which uses an optimization approach with a
detection oracle, and a black box attacker, which uses an autoen-
coder to translate anomalous data into normal data. We evaluate
our implementation on two different datasets from the water dis-
tribution domain, showing that the detector’s Recall drops from
0.68 to 0.12 by manipulating 4 sensors out of 82 in WADI dataset.
In addition, we show that our black box attacks are transferable to

CNN-based detectors. Finally, we implement and demonstrate our
attacks on a real industrial testbed to demonstrate their feasibility

1 INTRODUCTION
Computational and physical infrastructures are nowadays intercon-
nected. Computers, communication networks, sensors, and actua-
tors allow to control physical processes, resulting in what is known
as cyber-physical systems (CPS). Examples of such systems are
interconnected critical industrial control systems (ICS) like power
grids [36], water supply systems [3], and autonomous vehicles [8].
The integration of modern security features into existing ICS
is challenging, as solutions have to be backward compatible with
decades-old devices in the field, which do not support authentica-
tion or encryption. As a result, attackers with the goal of damaging
the process and local access to the network are usually assumed
to be able to eavesdrop on traffic, send malicious commands to
