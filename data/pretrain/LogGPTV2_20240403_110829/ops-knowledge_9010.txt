I am currently using IDLE, which is decent, but I am interested in exploring other lightweight IDEs specifically designed for Mac—whether they are free or commercial. 

Could you recommend any alternatives?

**Response:**

I would recommend considering the following options:

1. **Aptana Studio + PyDev**: Aptana Studio is a more visually appealing and user-friendly alternative to Eclipse. When combined with PyDev, it provides robust support for Python development, including debugging, code completion, and project management.

2. **PyCharm**: PyCharm is a powerful and popular IDE for Python. It comes in both free (Community Edition) and paid (Professional Edition) versions. The Professional Edition offers additional features such as web development support and advanced database tools.

3. **TextMate**: While not a full-fledged IDE, TextMate is a highly customizable text editor that is well-suited for coding. It is lightweight and integrates well with various programming languages, including Python. However, it may not offer the same level of debugging and project management features as a dedicated IDE.

These options should provide a good balance of functionality and ease of use for Python development on a Mac.
