User: I'm currently using IDLE, its decent, but I'd like to know if there're better lightweight IDEs built especially for Mac â€” free or commercial.
Assistant: I would recommend you to look at Aptana(it's more attractive then Eclipse for me)+PyDev or PyCarm. I use TextMate too, but those are easy for debug.
