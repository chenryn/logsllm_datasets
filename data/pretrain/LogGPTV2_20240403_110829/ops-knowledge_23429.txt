User: How to set up a secure password policy to ensure the security of administrator and user accounts?
Assistant: The following are recommendations for setting a secure password policy: 1. Enforce password length and complexity: To prevent passwords from being guessed or cracked, password length and complexity should be enforced. For example, require passwords to contain at least eight characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 2. Change the password regularly: Changing the password regularly can prevent unauthorized access, and it is recommended to change the password every three months. 3. Prohibit the use of common passwords: users are prohibited from using too simple or common passwords, such as "123456", "qwerty", etc., so as not to be vulnerable to attack. 4. Allow account locking and unlocking: When a user enters a wrong password multiple times, the account should be allowed to be locked to prevent attackers from using brute force to crack the password to attack the account. Administrators should have permission to unlock accounts. 5. Inform users of the security and importance of passwords: If users are not aware of the security and importance of passwords, it is easy to cause security problems such as password leakage. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen users' password security awareness through appropriate training and publicity. 6. Use multi-factor authentication: Use multi-factor authentication to improve security. For example, various methods such as SMS verification code or fingerprint recognition can be used to verify the user's identity. 7. Regularly review and update password policies: Password policies need to be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they comply with the latest security standards and best practices.
