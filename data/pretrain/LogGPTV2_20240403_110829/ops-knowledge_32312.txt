User: I am using Twisted to receive data from a socket.
My protocol class inherits from Protocol.
As there are no byte type in Python 2.*, the type of received data is str.
Of course, len (data) gives me the length of the string but how can I know
the number of bytes received ? There is not sizeof or something equivalent that allows
me to know the number of bytes ? 
Or should I consider that whatever the platform, the number of bytes will be 2 * len (data) ?
thanks in advance
Assistant: In Python 2,

str → a sequence of bytes, which is sometimes used as ASCII text
bytes → an alias for str (available in python 2.6 and later)
unicode → a sequence of unicode code units (UCS-2 or UCS-4, depending on compile time options, UCS-2 by default)

In Python 3,

str → a sequence of unicode code units (UCS-4)
bytes → a sequence of bytes
unicode → no such thing any more, you mean str

Think of the type passed to dataReceived as bytes.  It is bytes in Python 2.x, it will be bytes when Twisted has been ported to Python 3.x.
Therefore, the length in bytes of the received segment is simply len(data).
