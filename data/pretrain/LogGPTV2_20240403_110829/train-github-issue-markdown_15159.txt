This is more of a FYI kind of issue.
**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
When making a request via Axios, if an error is caught and logged as-is, it
will contain the entire request object which contains headers which can
include credentials such as API keys.  
If someone isn't aware of this and just logs the entire error object or
error.toJSON() without sanitising it, they can leak sensitive data and
credentials.
**Describe the solution you'd like**  
A config option to not append the request object to thrown errors and keep
only the standard error properties from the spec
https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_class_error
**Describe alternatives you've considered**  
I've worked around this by creating a new error object and only copying the
standard error properties and the response status to the new error and
throwing that instead.
