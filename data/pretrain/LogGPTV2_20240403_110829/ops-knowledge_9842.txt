User: When I enter my virtual environment (source django_venv/bin/activate), how do I make that environment transfer to apps run outside the terminal, such as Eclipse or even Idle?  Even if I run Idle from the virtualenv terminal window command line (by typing idle), none of my pip installed frameworks are available within Idle, such as SQLAlchemy (which is found just fine when running a python script from within the virtual environment).
Assistant: Tell Eclipse or Idle that the python interpreter is django_venv/bin/python instead of /usr/bin/python
