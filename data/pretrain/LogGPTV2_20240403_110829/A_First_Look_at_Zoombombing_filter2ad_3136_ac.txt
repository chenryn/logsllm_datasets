zoombombing invitation. More precisely, a bombing tweet
needs to meet the following two criteria:
• An invitation to bombing with a link (invitation text
usually comes with a link)
• A clear indication of bombing, such as “raid,” “bomb,”
“troll,” “discord,” “disruptive,” and “make fun of it.”
As with 4chan, we were generally conservative in our labeling
and default to non-bombing in uncertain cases.
From the 3.5K English tweets, we randomly sampled 500
so all services were equally represented (i.e., balanced with
respect to services). From these 500, we manually selected
20 tweets, and four coders independently determined whether
they were a bombing tweet or not. The inter-rater reliability
again shows perfect agreement (Fleiss’ κ = 1.0). Because of
the high agreement scores on the initial testing set, as well as
the agreement on the 4chan ratings, we had a single annotator
label the remaining 3,490 tweets in this dataset. Note that this
is a much quicker process than on 4chan, since the coder had
to look at single tweets instead of full (and often long) threads.
In the end, we ﬁnd that 95 out of the 3,510 candidate
English tweets are bombing tweets. From Figure 3 we see
that zoombombing on Twitter is less pervasive than on 4chan.
In particular, of the 3,039 Zoom related candidate tweets, 75
are labeled as bombing, and 20 of the 157 Google Meet tweets
are bombing. We found no bombing tweets for the other eight
meeting tools.
Phase II: Characterizing zoombombing
While labeling threads and tweets as bombing or not is
vital to understanding the problem, it does little to characterize
the actual bombing activity itself. In this phase we aim to
understand the process of a zoombombing event by analyzing
the behavior that goes on in bombing threads.
We began by having four annotators go through the labeled
bombing threads/tweets as determined by the Phase I labeling.
This was a relatively loose process where the goal was to get a
general sense of what is going on. Next, the annotators met and
discussed their observations. In general there was agreement
between the annotators of a clear trend of insider complicity in
bombing of online classes in particular. After several rounds
of discussion, we derived four, high level properties relevant
to zoombombing threads and tweets: 1) thread structure (only
applicable to 4chan threads), 2) link information, 3) invitation
information, and 4) interaction (only applicable to 4chan
threads).
Thread structure: New threads on 4chan are created when
a so called “Original Poster” creates an “Original Post” and
the thread constitutes replies to this post (NB: unlike other
platforms, 4chan threads are ﬂat) [23]. Thus, the ﬁrst post in
a thread usually represents the topic of the thread. We coded
the following characteristics of a thread:
1) Whether the content of the ﬁrst post is a zoombombing
invitation. This indicates whether or not the thread was
created primarily to act as a bombing thread as opposed
to organically evolving into one.
2) The length of the thread (i.e., the number of posts), which
indicates the thread’s popularity.
3) The number of bombing invitation links, which is indica-
tive of how the thread evolved with respect to bombing.
Link information: According to our deﬁnition of a bombing
thread/tweet, both 4chan and Twitter posts need to include a
video conference invitation link or meeting ID to be considered
a bombing thread. For certain meeting platforms (e.g., Zoom)
we can derive two additional pieces of information from
meeting links directly: 1) institutional information (i.e., who
is hosting the meeting) and 2) password protection.
For
some platforms, we
can automatically identify
password-protected links by looking at a password parameter
in the URL (e.g., https://zoom.us/j/123456789?pwd=12345aA
bBcC678). When coding messages manually, we also look at
the presence of passwords in the text of posts. Institutional in-
formation provides us additional information on the victims of
attacks. To gather this information, we need to manually look
at the URL (e.g., http://UNIVERSITY.zoom.us/j/XXXXXX),
and search for its associated institution. We record each
institution, its type (e.g., University), and country.
Invitation information: As noted previously, there are plenty
of legitimate reasons to post a link to a video conference, and
thus a posted link itself is not sufﬁcient to say that an attack has
occurred; this is why we require additional text calling for an
attack. During our initial examination, we noticed that there
was often additional information embedded in the bombing
invitation itself, e.g., temporal details as well as hints at the
existence of insiders.
“[ZOOMURL] this class is up the tuesdays at
11:00 am UTC-5 crash this class plz.”
For temporal information, we manually read the bombing
invitation and labeled the meeting time according to three
codes 1) future event, where the poster indicates the attached
link will be active at some point in the future, 2) live event,
where the poster indicates the meeting link is active and that
bombers should join “now,” and 3) not sure, where there
was no clear indication of when the link would be active.

This temporal information indicates whether or not a bombing
attack has been planned, or if it is an opportunistic attack.
Our preliminary analysis indicated that many zoombombing
invitations are created by insiders, for example students in the
case of college classes. To better understand insider complicity,
we label each bombing post or thread as either 1) insider
or 2) non-insider. To be labeled as insider,
the bombing
invitation should include text like “my teacher” or “our class,”
provide a password for the video conference (either explicitly
in post
text or implicitly in the link to the meeting), or
give suggestions on what names bombers should select when
joining the call (a tactic used to make it harder for legitimate
meeting attendees/hosts to determine that joining bombers are
not supposed to be there). Annotators recorded the details of
what led to any insider label applied. Again, we conservatively
label threads as non-insider if there is any doubt.
Interaction: For 4chan, we are able to collect entire threads
discussing zoombombing. For these threads, we read the whole
thread and record the following characteristics of the thread
discussion:
• Time interval: the interval between the bombing invitation
post and the ﬁrst interaction post by other users (this
characteristic is programmatically calculated);
• Problem feedback: participants reporting problems about
their zoombombing attempts, for example being unable
to join the meeting room, or being kicked out by the host;
• Toxic speech: participants insulting the host of the meet-
ing with profanity, hate speech, etc.;
• Crime scene feedback: reports on successful attacks with
details on what happened during the disrupted meeting;
For phase II, four raters independently rated 20 randomly
chosen threads from 123 bombing 4chan threads and 20
random tweets from 95 bombing tweets from Twitter. Inter-
rater reliability showed a perfect agreement in both sampled
datasets (Fleiss’ Kappa 1.0). We then split the rest of the
dataset into four groups, with each rater coding one group.
V. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
To better understand the zoombombing phenomenon, we
ﬁrst start by quantitatively analyzing the 123 4chan threads
and 95 tweets that we identiﬁed as part of the coding
process, comparing them with posts and threads containing
non-bombing meeting links. We focus our analysis on three
aspects: 1) understanding which services are targeted the most
by zoombombing 2) examining how zoombombing unfolds
temporally and 3) using natural language processing tech-
niques to quantify the content of zoombombing threads.
A. Targeted services
We observe that
the platforms with a larger user base
(see Table I) seem to attract more zoombombing attacks. In
particular, we ﬁnd 129 bombing links on Zoom, 66 on Google
Meet, 10 on Webex, 7 on Jitsi, 3 on Skype, 2 on GoToMeeting,
and 1 on Teams, while there are none for Hangouts, Bluejeans,
and Starleaf.
Figure 4: Number of posts per week for bombing & non-bombing
threads and tweets. The vertical line indicates the beginning of the
COVID-19 lockdown in the United States (on the week of 3/2/2020,
when several West Coast US universities started going online.)
B. Temporal Analysis
Figure 4 plots the weekly occurrences of bombing and
non-bombing posts on Twitter and 4chan. From the ﬁgure,
we see that posts with meeting links became more prevalent
(especially on Twitter) as the COVID-19 shutdown began in
March 2020 (shown in the ﬁgure with blue line1). On 4chan,
we observe a spike in benign posts containing meeting links
around New Years Eve 2020, attributable to users organizing
social gatherings as well as increased activity of a far-right
group on the following week. An example of a non-bombing
thread that appears repetitively, including a Google Hangout
link on New Years Eve is the following:
“JOIN OR YOUR MOTHER DIES :3 [HANG-
OUTURL]”
Generally speaking, zoombombing as a phenomenon barely
existed before the quarantine. We observe a decline of the phe-
nomenon in June 2020, potentially linked to school holidays;
this is in line with the fact that we observe that most calls
for zoombombing target school lectures and college classes,
as discussed later in Section VI-A.
Next, we plot the number of posts per hour of the day for
4chan posts and tweets with bombing links in Figure 5. On
Twitter, we ﬁnd that zoombombing activity does not exhibit
clear diurnal patterns. On 4chan, bombing posts are mostly
shared from 08:00 to 23:00 UTC. We did not encounter any
zoombombing tweet that speciﬁed a location and only 13
zoombombing posts had country information on 4chan (8
USA, 1 Indonesia, 1 Bulgaria, 1 Turkey, 1 Chile and 1 Italy).
Considering the lack of diurnal patterns in Figure 5, we infer
that zoombombing calls are not a localized problem.
Temporal analysis of 4chan threads. To better understand
zoombombing behavior, we analyze threads on 4chan with

post containing zoombombing links. This allows us to get a
quantitative understanding of how discussion of zoombombing
activity unfolds on the platform. Our 123 zoombombing
threads have 2,693 total posts in them. We compare these
123 threads to the 311 threads (44,528 posts) that included
a meeting link but were not bombing threads. Finally, we also
compare to a baseline of 4chan posts chosen by sampling
threads at random (without replacement) on a per-day basis
such that we have the same number of baseline threads per
day as we have threads where a meeting link was posted.
Figure 6 plots the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of
the duration of threads in our dataset (deﬁned as the difference
in the timestamp of the last post and the timestamp of the
original post). Recall that threads on 4chan are ephemeral,
and once a thread is not active for a while it gets pruned and
no further posts can be made [23]. From the ﬁgure, we observe
that bombing threads have a shorter lifetime than other threads:
50% of bombing threads are active for less than 5 minutes,
compared to 30 minutes for randomly sampled threads, and
two hours for non-bombing threads. That said, we do have a
long tail with about 10% of bombing threads lasting over 2
hours, compared to 7 hours for sampled threads and 12 hours
for non-bombing threads.
In our threat model, threads become an aggregation point for
attackers, and so understanding the feedback Charlie receives
from the bombers he is trying to recruit is important. Thus,
Figure 7 plots the delay between the bombing link being
posted on 4chan and the ﬁrst reply. From the ﬁgure, we see
that 79% of zoombombing threads receive their ﬁrst reply
within 10 minutes. One explanation for this is that calls for
zoombombing might be time sensitive; indeed in Section VI-B
we show that many attackers are inviting bombers to join live
meetings/classes. We then look at the interpost arrival time
between each post in a thread. Similarly, Figure 8 plots the
CDF of interpost arrival times, which is the time between
consecutive posts in threads, for bombing and non-bombing
threads. For most threads the elapsed time between consecutive
posts in bombing threads is similar to sampled threads while
being higher compared non-bombing threads. One explanation
for this is that non-bombing meeting links tend to be posted to
organize social gatherings, and thus tend to show up in more
popular, faster moving threads. An alternative explanation is
that while the zoombombing attack is happening 4chan users
are slower in replying in the thread because they are busy
performing malicious activities in the meeting itself.

green line2). This is a worrying trend, since, as we conﬁrm
in Section VI-A, it indicates that many attacks are called for
by insiders who have legitimate access to the meetings. This
calls into question existing security measures and provides the
impetus for rethinking these mitigation strategies.
D. Content Analysis
After looking at timing information and at the characteristics
of URLs, we focus on analyzing the language of social media
posts/threads containing zoombombing invitations on Twitter
and 4chan. To this end, we leverage word embedding models
(i.e., word2vec [35]) to quantitatively learn about the context
in which zoombombing links are discussed. Intuitively, this
allows us to identify common themes used in discussions
where the links appear. To build our models, we ﬁrst replace
all meeting links with the keyword “meetinglink.”
For both 4chan and Twitter, we train two word2vec models,
one for posts (and threads in the case of 4chan) containing
zoombombing links, and one for posts and threads with benign
meeting links. On 4chan, we use a window size of 7 and limit
our vocabulary to words that appear at least 5 or 84 times for
bombing and non-bombing threads, respectively, maintaining
the ratio of total posts left after preprocessing. To avoid the
effect of common/unnecessary words in our model, we remove
stop words, punctuation, other URLs, mentions, posts with
only one word, and exact quotes of previous posts in the case
of threads. We also lemmatize the posts and convert all text
to lowercase. On Twitter we apply the same pre-processing
techniques as 4chan, as well as removing emojis, numbers,
non-alphanumeric characters from words, and some Twitter-
related keywords like RT and FAV. Since tweets are usually
shorter than 4chan posts, to build our word2vec models we
use a window size of 5. We keep words that appear at least 7
times for non-bombing tweets and words that appear at least
once for bombing tweets to maintain ratios as we do for 4chan.
Since online meeting links do not have a ﬁxed position in
posts, but attackers place them arbitrarily as a word inside
of a sentence, we use the Continuous Bag-Of-Words Model
(CBOW) [35] for training our models.
Most representative words. After building our models, we
want to identify the words that are “closer” to zoombombing
