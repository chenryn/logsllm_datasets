Subject: Issue with Carousel Looping in Bootstrap

Hello everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am encountering an issue with the carousel functionality in Bootstrap, and I wanted to reach out to see if anyone else is experiencing the same problem or has a better solution.

**Issue Description:**
On all browsers, the carousel does not loop back to the first image after reaching the last one.

**Temporary Fix:**
To address this, I removed the following line from `bootstrap.js` (line 1389):
```javascript
if (!$next.length) return;
```
After making this change, the carousel appears to loop correctly. However, I am concerned that this might not be the best long-term solution.

**Question:**
Is anyone else facing this issue? If so, have you found a more reliable or official fix?

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
