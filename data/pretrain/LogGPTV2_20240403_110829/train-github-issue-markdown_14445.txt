Hi everyone,
I don't really know if I have done something wrong, but here is my problem.
On every browser the carousel doesn't loop at the end of the last picture.  
To fixe it, I have deleted the line 1389 from bootstrap.js:
if (!$next.length) return
and now, it seem to work, am I the only one having this problem?
Thanks.
