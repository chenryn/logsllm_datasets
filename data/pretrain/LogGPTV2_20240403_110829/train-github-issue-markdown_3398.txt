## Expected Behavior
The Select component's onChange prop should probably expect `(event:
React.FormEvent) => void` type.
## Current Behavior
Currently it expects `(event: React.FormEvent) => void`. With
this even the example from docs doesn't work with Typescript as the
EventTarget of HTMLDivElement doesn't have the value property.
