### Issue Report

#### I have verified that this issue is not a duplicate by searching through the existing issues in this repository.

#### Expected Behavior
The `onChange` prop of the `Select` component should accept a function with the type `(event: React.FormEvent) => void`.

#### Current Behavior
Currently, the `onChange` prop expects a function with the type `(event: React.FormEvent) => void`. However, this type definition causes issues when using TypeScript, as the `EventTarget` of an `HTMLDivElement` does not have a `value` property. As a result, even the example provided in the documentation fails to work correctly with TypeScript.

#### Environment
- **Material-UI**: 1.0.0-beta.10
- **React**: 15.6.1
