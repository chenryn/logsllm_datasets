Layer 2 Port Mirroring Firewall Filters Overview
On an MX Series router and on an EX Series switch, you can configure a firewall filter term to specify
that Layer 2 port mirroring is to be applied to all packets at the interface to which the firewall filter is
applied.
You can apply a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter to the input or output logical interfaces (including
aggregated Ethernet logical interfaces), to traffic forwarded or flooded to a VLAN, or traffic forwarded or
flooded to a VPLS routing instance.
MX Series routers and EX Series switches support Layer 2 port mirroring of VPLS (family ethernet-
switching or family vpls) traffic and Layer 2 VPN traffic with family ccc in a Layer 2 environment
Within a firewall filter term, you can specify the Layer 2 port-mirroring properties under the then
statement in either of the following ways:
• Implicitly reference the Layer 2 port mirroring properties in effect on the port.
• Explicitly reference a particular named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring.
NOTE: When configuring a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter, do not include the optional from
statement that specifies match conditions based on the route source address. Omit this
statement so that all packets are considered to match and all actions and action-modifiers
specified in the then statement are taken.
If you want to mirror all incoming packets, then you must not use the from statement; /*
comment: one configure filter terms with from if they are interested in mirroring only a subset of
packets.
1152
NOTE: If you associate integrated routing and bridging (IRB) with the VLAN (or VPLS routing
instance), and also configure within the VLAN (or VPLS routing instance) a forwarding table filter
with the port-mirror or port-mirror-instance action, then the IRB packet is mirrored as a Layer 2
packet. You can disable this behavior by configuring the no-irb-layer-2-copy statement in the
VLAN (or VPLS routing instance).
For a detailed description of how to configure a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter, see Defining a
Layer 2 Port-Mirroring Firewall Filter.
For detailed information about how you can use Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filters with MX Routers
and EX Series switches configured as provider edge (PE) routers or PE switches, see Understanding
Layer 2 Port Mirroring of PE Router Logical Interfaces. For detailed information about configuring
firewall filters in general (including in a Layer 3 environment), see the Routing Policies, Firewall Filters,
and Traffic Policers User Guide.
Mirroring of Packets Received or Sent on a Logical Interface
To mirror Layer 2 traffic received or sent on a logical interface, apply a port-mirroring firewall filter to the
input or output of the interface.
A port-mirroring firewall filter can also be applied to an aggregated-Ethernet logical interface. For
details, see Understanding Layer 2 Port Mirroring of PE Router Aggregated Ethernet Interfaces.
NOTE: If port-mirroring firewall filters are applied at both the input and output of a logical
interface, two copies of each packet are mirrored. To prevent the router or switch from
forwarding duplicate packets to the same destination, you can enable the “mirror-once” option
for Layer 2 port mirroring in the global instance for the Layer 2 packet address family.
Mirroring of Packets Forwarded or Flooded to a VLAN
To mirror Layer 2 traffic forwarded to or flooded to a VLAN, apply a port-mirroring firewall filter to the
input to the forwarding table or flood table. Any packet received for the VLAN forwarding or flood table
and that matches the filter conditions is mirrored.
For more information about VLANs, see Understanding Layer 2 Bridge Domains . For information about
flooding behavior in a VLAN, see Understanding Layer 2 Learning and Forwarding for Bridge Domains .
1153
NOTE: When you configure port mirroring on any interface under one VLAN, the mirrored
packet can move to an external analyzer located on different VLANs.
Mirroring of Packets Forwarded or Flooded to a VPLS Routing Instance
To mirror Layer 2 traffic forwarded to or flooded to a VPLS routing instance, apply a port-mirroring
firewall filter to the input to the forwarding table or flood table. Any packet received for the VPLS
routing instance forwarding or flood table and that matches the filter condition is mirrored.
For more information about VPLS routing instances, see Configuring a VPLS Routing Instance and
Configuring VLAN Identifiers for Bridge Domains and VPLS Routing Instances. For information about
flooding behavior in VPLS, see the Junos OS VPNs Library for Routing Devices.
Defining a Layer 2 Port-Mirroring Firewall Filter
For virtual private LAN service (VPLS) traffic (family ethernet-switching or family vpls) and for Layer 2 VPNs
with family cccon MX Series routers and on EX Series switches only, you can define a firewall filter that
specifies Layer 2 port mirroring as the action to be performed if a packet matches the conditions
configured in the firewall filter term.
You can use a Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter in the following ways:
• To mirror packets received or sent on a logical interface.
• To mirror packets forwarded or flooded to a VLAN.
• To mirror packets forwarded or flooded to a VPLS routing instance.
• To mirror tunnel interface input packets only to multiple destinations.
For a summary of the three types of Layer 2 port-mirroring you can configure on an MX Series router
and on an EX Series switch, see Application of Layer 2 Port Mirroring Types.
To define a firewall filter with a Layer 2 port-mirroring action:
1. Enable configuration of firewall filters for Layer 2 packets that are part of a VLAN, a Layer 2
switching cross-connect, or a virtual private LAN service (VPLS):
[edit]
user@host# edit firewall family family
The value of the family option can be ethernet-switching , ccc, or vpls.
1154
2. Enable configuration of a firewall filter pm-filter-name:
[edit firewall family family]
user@host# edit filter pm-filter-name
3. Enable configuration of a firewall filter term pm-filter-term-name:
[edit firewall family family filter pm-filter-name]
user@host# edit term pm-filter-term-name
4. (Optional) Specify the firewall filter match conditions based on the route source address only if you
want to mirror a subset of the sampled packets.
• For detailed information about Layer 2 bridging firewall filter match conditions (which are
supported on MX Series routers and EX Series switches only), see Firewall Filter Match
Conditions for Layer 2 Bridging Traffic.
• For detailed information about VPLS firewall filter match conditions, see Firewall Filter Match
Conditions for VPLS Traffic.
• For detailed information about Layer 2 circuit cross-connect (CCC) firewall filter match conditions,
see Firewall Filter Match Conditions for Layer 2 CCC Traffic.
NOTE: If you want all sampled packets to be considered to match (and be subjected to the
actions specified in the then statement), then omit the from statement altogether.
5. Enable configuration of the action and action-modifier to apply to matching packets:
[edit firewall family family filter pm-filter-name term pm-filter-term-name]
user@host# edit then
6. Specify the actions to be taken on matching packets:
[edit firewall family family filter pm-filter-name term pm-filter-term-name then]
user@host# set action
The recommended value for the action is accept. If you do not specify an action, or if you omit the then
statement entirely, all packets that match the conditions in the from statement are accepted.
7. Specify Layer 2 port mirroring or a next-hop group as the action-modifier:
1155
• To reference the Layer 2 port mirroring properties currently in effect for the Packet Forwarding
Engine or PIC associated with the underlying physical interface, use the port-mirror statement:
[edit firewall family family filter pm-filter-name term pm-filter-term-name then]
user@host# set port-mirror
• To reference the Layer 2 port mirroring properties configured in a specific named instance, use the
port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name action modifier:
[edit firewall family family filter pm-filter-name term pm-filter-term-name then]
user@host# set port-mirror-instance pm-instance-name
If the underlying physical interface is not bound to a named instance of Layer 2 port mirroring but
instead is implicitly bound to the global instance of Layer 2 port mirroring, then traffic at the
logical interface is mirrored according to the properties specified in the named instance
referenced by the port-mirror-instance action modifier.
• To reference a next-hop group that specifies the next-hop addresses (for sending additional
copies of packets to an analyzer), use the next-hop-group pm-next-hop-group-name action modifier:
[edit firewall family family filter pm-filter-name term pm-filter-term-name then]
user@host# set next-hop-group pm-next-hop-group-name
For configuration information about next-hop groups, see Defining a Next-Hop Group for Layer 2
Port Mirroring. If you specify a next-hop group for Layer 2 port mirroring, the firewall filter term
applies to the tunnel interface input only.
8. Verify the minimum configuration of the Layer 2 port-mirroring firewall filter:
[edit firewall ... ]
user@host# top
[edit]
user@host# show firewall
family (ethernet-switching | ccc | vpls) { # Type of packets to mirror
filter pm-filter-name { # Firewall filter name
term pm-filter-term-name {
from { # Do not specify match conditions based on route source address
}
then {
action; # Recommended action is ’accept’
1156
action-modifier; # Three options for Layer 2 port mirroring
}
}
}
}
In the firewall filter term then statement, the action-modifier can be port-mirror, port-mirror-instance , or
next-hop-group pm-next-hop-group-name.
Configuring Protocol-Independent Firewall Filter for Port Mirroring
On MX Series routers with MPCs, you can configure a firewall filter to mirror Layer 2 and Layer 3
packets at a global level and at an instance level. When port mirror is configured at ingress or egress, the
packet entering or exiting an interface is copied and the copies are sent to the local interface for local
monitoring.
NOTE: Starting with Junos OS Release 13.3R6, only MPC interfaces support family any to do port
mirroring. DPC interfaces do not support family any.
Typically, the firewall filter is configured such that it mirrors either Layer 2 or Layer 3 packets based on
the family configured at the interface. However, in case of an integrated routing and bridging (IRB)
interface, Layer 2 packets are not completely mirrored because IRB interfaces are configured to mirror
only Layer 3 packets. On such an interface, you can configure a firewall filter and port mirroring
parameters in the family any to ensure that a packet is completely mirrored irrespective of whether it is
a Layer 2 or a Layer 3 packet.
NOTE:
• For port mirroring at an instance, you can configure one or more families such as inet, inet6,
ccc, and vpls simultaneously for the same instance.
• In case of Layer 2 port mirroring, VLAN tags, MPLS headers are retained and can be seen in
the mirrored copy at egress.
• For VLAN normalization, the information before normalization is seen for a mirrored packet at
ingress. Similarly, at egress, the information after normalization is seen for the mirrored
packet.
Before you begin configuring port mirroring, you must configure valid physical interfaces.
To configure a protocol-independent firewall filter for port mirroring:
1157
1. Configure a global firewall filter for mirroring egress or ingress traffic.
[edit firewall family any]
user@host# set filter filter-name {
term term-name {
then {
port-mirror;
accept;
}
}
}
2. Configure a firewall filter to mirror traffic for an instance.
[edit firewall family any]
user@host# set filter filter-name {
term term-name {
then {
port-mirror-instance instance-name;
accept;
}
}
}
3. Configure mirroring parameters for egress and ingress traffic.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@host# input {
maximum-packet-length bytes
rate rate;
}
family any {
output {
(next-hop-group group-name | interface interface-name);
}
}
1158
4. Configure mirroring parameters for an instance. In this configuration, you can specify the output or
destination for the Layer 2 packets to be either a valid next-hop group or a Layer 2 interface.
[edit forwarding-options port-mirroring]
user@host#instance instance-name {
family any{
output {
(next-hop-group group-name | interface interface-name);
}
}
}
5. Configure the firewall filter at the ingress or egress interface on which the packets are transmitted.
[edit interface interface-name unit]
user@host# filter {
output filter-name;
input filter-name;
}

Topology | 1159
In this example, xe-0/0/0 and xe-0/0/6 serve as connections for employee computers. Interface xe-0/0/47 is
connected to a device running an analyzer application.
Rather than mirror all traffic, it is usually desirable to mirror only certain traffic. This is a more-efficient
use of your bandwidth and hardware and might be necessary because of constraints on these assets.
This example mirrors only traffic sent from employee computers to the Web.

IN THIS SECTION
Procedure | 1160
To specify that the only traffic that will be mirrored is traffic sent by employees to the Web, perform the
tasks explained in this section. To select this traffic for mirroring, you use a firewall filter to specify this
traffic and direct it to a port-mirroring instance.
Procedure
CLI Quick Configuration
To quickly configure local port mirroring of traffic from employee computers that is destined for the
Web, copy the following commands and paste them into a switch terminal window:
[edit]
set forwarding-options port-mirroring family inet output interface xe-0/0/47.0 next-hop
192.0.2.100/24
set firewall family inet filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from destination-address
192.0.2.16/24
set firewall family inet filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from source-address
192.0.2.16/24
set firewall family inet filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
set firewall family inet filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from destination-port 80
set firewall family inet filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-mirror
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family address 192.0.1.1/24
set interfaces xe-0/0/6 unit 0 family address 192.0.1.2/24
set interfaces xe-0/0/47 unit 0 family address 192.0.1.3/24
set interfaces xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet filter input watch-employee
set interfaces xe-0/0/6 unit 0 family inet filter input watch-employee
Step-by-Step Procedure
To configure local port mirroring of employee to web traffic from the two ports connected to employee
computers:
1161
1. Configure a port-mirroring instance, including the output interface and the IP address of the device
running the analyzer application as the next hop. (Configure only the output—the input comes from
the filter.) You must also specifying that the mirror is for IPv4 traffic (family inet).
[edit forwarding-options]
user@switch# set forwarding-options port-mirroring family inet output interface xe-0/0/47.0
next-hop 192.0.2.100/28
2. Configure an IPv4 (family inet) firewall filter called watch-employee that includes a term to match traffic
sent to the Web and send it to the port-mirroring instance. Traffic sent to and arriving from the
corporate subnet (destination or source address of 192.0.nn.nn/24) does not need to be copied, so first
create another term to accept that traffic before it reaches the term that sends Web traffic to the
instance:
[edit firewall family inet]
er@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from destination-address
192.0.nn.nn/24
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp from source-address
192.0.nn.nn/24
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-corp then accept
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web from destination-port 80
user@switch# set filter watch-employee term employee-to-web then port-mirror
3. Configure addresses for the IPv4 interfaces connected to the employee computers and the analyzer
device:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.0.1.1/24
user@switch# set xe-0/0/6 unit 0 family inet address 192.0.1.2/24
user@switch# set interfaces xe-0/0/47 unit 0 family address 192.0.1.3/24
4. Apply the firewall filter to the appropriate interfaces as an ingress filter:
[edit interfaces]
user@switch# set xe-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet filter input watch-employee
user@switch# set xe-0/0/6 unit 0 family inet filter input watch-employee
1162

Check the results of the configuration:
[edit]
user@switch# show
