User: I am using Python 2.7.3 in Ubuntu 12.04 OS. I have an external program say 'xyz' whose input is a single file and two files say 'abc.dat' and 'gef.dat' are its output. 
When I used os.system or subprocess.check_output or os.popen none of them printed the output files in the working directory. 
I need these output files for further calculations. 
Plus I've to keep calling the 'xyz' program 'n' times and have to keep getting the output 'abc.dat' and 'gef.dat' every time from it. Please help.
Thank you
Assistant: Thank you for answering my question but the answer to my question is this - 
import subprocess
subprocess.call("/path/to/software/xyz abc.dat", shell=True)
which gave me the desired the output. 
I tried the subprocess-related commands but they returned error " No such file or directory". The 'shell=True' worked like a charm. 
Thank you all again for taking your time to answer my question.
