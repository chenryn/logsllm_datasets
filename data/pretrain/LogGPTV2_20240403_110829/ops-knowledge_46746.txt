User: When the CPU usage exceeds 50%, please write a shell script to periodically check and output the process information with high CPU usage to the log.
Assistant: #!/bin/bash # Set the threshold value for CPU usage THRESHOLD=50 # Set the interval for checking CPU usage (in seconds) INTERVAL=60 # Set the log file name LOGFILE=/var/log/high-cpu.log while true; do # Check the current CPU usage for all processes and sort by CPU usage PROCESSES=$(ps -eo pid,comm,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | awk '{if($3 > '$THRESHOLD' ) print}') # If there are any processes with CPU usage over the threshold, log them to the file if [ -n "$PROCESSES" ]; then echo "$(date) - High CPU usage detected:" >> $ LOGFILE echo "$PROCESSES" >> $LOGFILE fi # Wait for the next interval sleep $INTERVAL done # Save this script as "high-cpu.sh" and make it executable (chmod +x high-cpu.sh). # You can then run it in the background using nohup ./high-cpu.sh &
