APPENDIX
The Setup of DPI Experiments on the
Experimental Temperature Sensing Circuitry
Figure 16: The setup of direct power injections through dif-
ferent injection points of a typical NTC-based temperature
sensing circuitry. In this illustration, the signal injection cir-
cuit is connected to the injection point P1.
As shown in Fig. 16, a 1-meter NTC thermistor is wired in a
bridge circuit, which is excited by a +5V DC power source. The
differential voltage generated by the bridge circuit is collected and
amplified by a Texas Instruments (TI) LM1458 operational amplifier.
By measuring the output voltage of the amplifier, the resistance
of the thermistor and the corresponding temperature can be cal-
culated. We choose the circuit elements based on the schematics
of temperature sensing circuits in infant incubators [13, 14]. Dur-
ing the experiments, the +5V and ±12V DC voltage sources are
provided by an Agilent E3630A triple output power supply. We
monitor the analog amplified output with an Agilent MSOX4054A
oscilloscope.
In our DPI experiments, we connect the output of the signal
injection circuit to each of the signal injection points on the sens-
ing circuitry. A 10nF capacitor is used to decouple the DC signal
in the experimental circuitry from the signal injection circuitry.
The source of the EMI signals is an Agilent N5172B vector signal
generator.
