User: How to build a highly available distributed system architecture? What technical options are there?
Assistant: The following aspects need to be considered in building a highly available distributed system architecture: 1. Database fault tolerance: use master-slave or cluster mode for database deployment to ensure data redundancy, failover and load balancing. 2. High availability of services: use a load balancer or distributed service framework to ensure high availability and load balancing of services. 3. Data consistency: use mechanisms such as distributed transactions or distributed locks to ensure data consistency. 4. Monitoring and fault recovery: adopt technologies such as traffic monitoring, log recording and automatic fault recovery to ensure the stability and reliability of the system. Currently commonly used optional technical solutions include: 1. ZooKeeper: Distributed coordination service, providing distributed locks, distributed configuration, naming services and other functions. 2. Consul: Distributed service discovery and configuration management platform, providing distributed health check, KV storage, DNS service and other functions. 3. Nginx: A high-performance load balancer that supports TCP and HTTP protocols, and can perform operations such as reverse proxy, HTTP caching, and SSL termination. 4. Haproxy: A high-performance load balancer that supports TCP and HTTP protocols, and can perform operations such as weight distribution, session maintenance, and SSL termination. 5. Spring Cloud: Distributed microservice framework, providing functions such as service registration discovery, service load balancing, service invocation, and configuration management. 6. Kubernetes: container orchestration management platform, providing container scheduling, automatic scaling, service discovery and other functions, supporting multiple cloud platforms and multiple deployment environments. 7. Istio: A service grid framework that provides functions such as load balancing, fault recovery, and traffic management, and supports multiple cloud platforms and multiple deployment environments.
