User: How to optimize database query performance? Please list common query optimization techniques and methods.
Assistant: 1. Use indexes: Reasonable use of indexes can greatly improve query speed, but the more indexes the better, the appropriate index design should be based on business needs and data volume. 2. Avoid using OR and NOT: OR and NOT operations will prevent the query optimizer from using indexes to speed up queries, so it is best to use AND operations instead. 3. Avoid full table scans: try to use conditional restrictions to reduce the number of rows that need to be scanned, such as using WHERE clauses and LIMIT restrictions. 4. Partition table: Divide data into different tables according to certain rules, which can improve the efficiency of querying large amounts of data. 5. Avoid using SELECT *: only query the required fields to avoid unnecessary data transmission and processing. 6. Avoid using subqueries: try to use joins instead of subqueries, because subqueries usually write the result set to a temporary table, which takes up a lot of memory and CPU. 7. Optimize SQL statements: Correct use of SQL statements can improve query efficiency, such as using EXISTS and IN instead of multiple OR conditions. 8. Reasonable use of cache: Cache the results of frequent queries in memory, which can avoid repeated querying of the database and improve efficiency. 9. Use a distributed database: Distribute data to multiple nodes for processing, which can improve query efficiency and scalability. 10. Regular database maintenance: including optimizing table structure, deleting expired data, regular backup and other operations, can improve the performance of the database.
