Furthermore, it is impossible to generate a consolidated credential using fewer than \( t \) partial credentials.

### Blind Issuance and Unlinkability
The authorities issue the credential without gaining any additional information about the private attributes embedded within it. Additionally, it is impossible to link multiple presentations of the credential with each other or with the issuing transcript, even if all authorities collude (see Section III-B).

### Non-Interactivity
The authorities can operate independently of one another, following a straightforward key distribution and setup phase to agree on public security and cryptographic parameters. They do not need to synchronize or further coordinate their activities.

### Liveness
Coconut ensures liveness as long as a threshold number of authorities remains honest and weak synchrony assumptions hold for the key distribution [33].

### Efficiency
The credentials and all zero-knowledge proofs involved in the protocols are both short and computationally efficient. After aggregation and re-randomization, the attribute presentation and verification processes involve only a single consolidated credential. Consequently, these processes have a constant time complexity \( O(1) \) in terms of both cryptographic computations and communication of cryptographic material, regardless of the number of authorities.

### Short Credentials
Each partial credential, as well as the consolidated credential, consists of exactly two group elements, irrespective of the number of authorities or the number of attributes embedded in the credentials. This allows for the use of a large number of authorities to issue credentials without significantly impacting efficiency.

## The Coconut Construction
We introduce the cryptographic primitives supporting the Coconut architecture, step by step, from the design of Pointcheval and Sanders [43] and Boneh et al. [10], [9] to the full Coconut scheme.

### Step 1: Review of the Scheme
We first recall (Section III-C) the scheme of Pointcheval and Sanders [43] and Boneh et al. [10], [9].
