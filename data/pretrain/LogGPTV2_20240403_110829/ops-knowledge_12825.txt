User: I am working on a Python/MySQL cloud app with a fairly complex architecture. Operating this system (currently) generates temporary files (plain text, YAML) and log files and I had intended to store them on the filesystem.
However, our prospective cloud operator only provides a temporary, non-persistent filesystem to apps. This means that the initial approach with storing the temporary and log files won't work.
There must be a standard approach to solving this problem which I am not aware of. I don't want to use object storage like S3 because it would extend the current stack and add complexity. But I have the possibility to install an additional, dedicated app (if there is anything made for this purpose) on a different server with the same provider. The only limitation is that it would have to be in PHP, Python, MySQL.
The generic question: What is the standard approach to storing files when no persistent filesystem is available?
And for my specific case: Is there any solution using Python and/or MySQL which is simple and quick to implement? Is this a usecase for Redis?
Assistant: Store your logs in MySQL. Just make a table like this:

x***time*****source*****action
----------------------------
****unixtime*somemodule*error/event

Your temporary storage should be enough for temporary files :)
