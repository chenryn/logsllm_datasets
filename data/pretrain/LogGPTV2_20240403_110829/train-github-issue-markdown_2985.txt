Since my question is lost in stackoverflow, I decided to post it here as a
bug, as I think it is.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38342266/shadowmap-cant-detect-all-
instances-on-three-instancedbuffergeometry
Basically the idea is having one bufferGeometry duplicated and having an
attribute array with the offsets of my objects (like they have in the above
example).
If I try to add shadows, I only get shadows on 1 object, which I assume is
because we only have 1 geometry.
Is there a way of adding shadows to all my objects?
