### Current Behavior:
When a dependency is specified as both a development dependency and an optional peer dependency, it is not installed.

### Expected Behavior:
All development dependencies should be installed, regardless of whether they are also listed as optional peer dependencies.

### Steps to Reproduce:
1. Check the Node.js and npm versions:
    ```sh
    luigi@ubuntu:~/ws$ node -v
    v15.0.1
    luigi@ubuntu:~/ws$ npm -v
    7.0.3
    ```

2. Clone the `ws` repository from GitHub:
    ```sh
    luigi@ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/websockets/ws.git
    Cloning into 'ws'...
    remote: Enumerating objects: 14410, done.
    remote: Total 14410 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 14410
    Receiving objects: 100% (14410/14410), 10.68 MiB | 969.00 KiB/s, done.
    Resolving deltas: 100% (11804/11804), done.
    ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository and install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    luigi@ubuntu:~$ cd ws
    luigi@ubuntu:~/ws$ npm i
    npm WARN deprecated har-validator@5.1.5: this library is no longer supported
    npm WARN deprecated request@2.88.2: request has been deprecated, see https://github.com/request/request/issues/3142
    added 352 packages, and audited 352 packages in 25s
    33 packages are looking for funding
      run `npm fund` for details
    found 0 vulnerabilities
    ```

4. Verify that the `utf-8-validate` package is not installed:
    ```sh
    luigi@ubuntu:~/ws$ npm ls utf-8-validate
    ws@7.3.1 /home/luigi/ws
    └── (empty)
    ```
