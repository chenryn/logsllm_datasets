factors from our models.
where α j| j+1 denotes the threshold parameter between response
categories j and j + 1, and uparticipanti denotes the random
effect for the participant in the ith observation, modeled as
an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian
random variable with zero mean and variance of σ 2
u , i.e.,
uparticipanti ∼ N (0,σ 2
u ),∀i ∈ {1, . . . ,N}. Moreover, for each
factor in the model, βfactori denotes the model coefﬁcient
corresponding to the level of that factor present in the ith
observation. Note that in the case of security/privacy attribute-
value pairs, our model captures i) whether each of the 16
security and privacy attributes in Table I was present or absent
in each observation, and ii) if present, whether the most
protective or the least protective value of that attribute was
observed.4
Table II presents the results of the two models. For each
model, we present the variance of random effects σ 2
u and
threshold parameters {α j| j+1}J−1
j=1. Moreover, for each factor,
we report its estimate, i.e., the corresponding β coefﬁcient
in (1), as well as its standard error and p-value. We also
provide the odds ratios of increased risk and willingness to
purchase for each factor, respectively deﬁned as
ORrisk(+)|factor (cid:44)
Pr(slightly/strongly increased risk | factor)
1−Pr(slightly/strongly increased risk | factor)
Pr(slightly/strongly increased risk | factor_baseline)
1−Pr(slightly/strongly increased risk | factor_baseline)

Pr(slightly/strongly increased willingness to purchase | factor_baseline)
1−Pr(slightly/strongly increased willingness to purchase | factor_baseline)

Finally, we provide the odds ratios of decreased risk and
willingness to purchase for each factor, respectively deﬁned as

In both models, we select purpose: device function to be the
baseline for sp_attribute_value, as it is the purpose that
most IoT devices will serve, possibly in addition to others. The
smart light bulb is selected as the baseline for device_type,
since its data collection is less concerning, the baselines for
factors device_exposure and device_recipient are
selected to be the most common values of these factors, and
the baseline for prior_scenarios is 0 scenarios as its ﬁrst
level. The selection of baselines implies that their corresponding
β coefﬁcients in (1) are set to zero by the model. Note that
the selection of baselines will not affect the ﬁnal output of
the models, e.g., in terms of the cumulative response category
probabilities (1) and odds ratios (2)-(5).
For the risk perception model, a positive estimate for a
factor indicates an increase in risk perception compared to the
baseline of that factor. Similarly, in the willingness to purchase
4In case of the presence of the control over attribute, our model captures
which of three most protective values was observed by the participant.
