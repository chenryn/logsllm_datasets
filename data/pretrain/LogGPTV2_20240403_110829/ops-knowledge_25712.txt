User:  How to implement a specific script to run automatically when booting in the Linux system?
Assistant: The following steps can be taken to automatically run a specific script on boot in the Linux system: 1. Write the script to be run and save it to a specified location, such as /home/user/startup.sh. 2. Set the script as an executable file, use the chmod +x /home/user/startup.sh command to set it. 3. Open the /etc/rc.local file and add the script to run. For example, add the following line: /home/user/startup.sh 4. Save the file and restart the system, the script will be executed automatically when the system starts. Note: You need to perform the above operations with root privileges. If the /etc/rc.local file does not exist or has been deleted, it needs to be created manually. In addition, some Linux distributions use systemd to manage system services, which need to be configured using the systemctl command.
