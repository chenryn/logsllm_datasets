where there is a synchronization offset ε between D and
H. If A ﬁxes his clock to H, it can infer the presence of
helper’s ON slots without having to resort to RSS estima-
tion. It should be noted here, the BS performs detection
of ON slots by taking an average value of the power of
all the samples. Therefore, a perfect synchronization be-
tween D and H is not required for the correctness of the
proposed protocol.
To prevent the inference of the helper’s ON slots based
on time misalignment, we randomize the start times of
each bit (ﬁrst slot of the MC ON-OFF bit) both at H and
D. Speciﬁcally, a random time offset ε, positive or neg-
ative, is selected from a uniform distribution U (εl,εh).
The lower bound εl is selected to be the maximum syn-
chronization error between D and H. This can be cal-
culated as the expected clock drift over the transmission
time of H plus a maximum time difference between path
delays. The upper bound τh can be some reasonable
value (e.g., 2εl). Moreover τ << t, where t is the slot
duration. This will ensure the correct sequence decoding

attempted to distinguish between D and H using the RSS
sampling method discussed in Section 6.1.1. Also, the
adversary canceled slots on which D or H’s signals were
indistinguishable. Figure 12(d) shows the probability δ
of accepting the adversary’s modiﬁed message as a func-
tion of the number of active helper slots |s| when the mes-
sage length is (cid:96) = 20. We observe that δ decreases dras-
tically compared to Figure 12(c). Moreover, imperfect
cancellation (pC < 1) leads to further deterioration of the
adversary’s performance. The results obtained support
the analytical results provided in Section 5, which are
computed assuming pC = 1.
Timing performance: The upper bound on the exe-
cution time of the DH protocol with HELP primarily de-
pends on the communication time of the ON-OFF keyed
message, since the rest of the messages are exchanged
in the normal communication mode. Public key param-
eters for an EC-DH key-agreement [58] can have values
from 160–512 bits, depending on the security require-
ment. Assuming a hash length of 160 bits and a slot du-
ration of 1ms, the time required to transmit the HELP
protected DH public primitive varies between 0.6–1.4s,
which is acceptable.
to the legitimate device and simultaneously transmits at
random times to allow the detection of cancellation at-
tacks at the BS. We showed that a pairing protocol such
as the DH key agreement protocol using HELP as an in-
tegrity protection primitive can resist MitM attacks with-
out requiring an authenticated channel between D and the
BS. This was not previously feasible by any of the pair-
ing methods if signal cancellation is possible. We studied
various implementation details of HELP and analyzed its
security. Our protocol is aimed at alleviating the device
pairing problem for IoT devices that may not have the
appropriate interfaces for entering or pre-loading crypto-
graphic primitives.

7 Conclusion
References
We considered the problem of pairing two devices using
in-band communications in the absence of prior shared
secrets. We proposed a new PHY-layer integrity protec-
tion scheme called HELP that is resistant to signal can-
cellation attacks. Our scheme operates with the assis-
tance of a helper device that has an authenticated chan-
nel to the BS. The helper is placed in close proximity
