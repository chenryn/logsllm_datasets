### Figure 11: Fraction of Slots Where One Device is Faster Than the Other as a Function of the Delay Offset ε

In this figure, we illustrate the fraction of slots where one device (D) outperforms the other (H) as a function of the delay offset ε. The delay offset ε represents the synchronization difference between D and H. If A synchronizes its clock with H, it can infer the presence of H's ON slots without relying on RSS (Received Signal Strength) estimation. It is important to note that the BS (Base Station) detects ON slots by averaging the power of all samples. Therefore, perfect synchronization between D and H is not necessary for the proposed protocol to function correctly.

### Preventing Inference of Helper’s ON Slots Based on Time Misalignment

To prevent the inference of the helper’s ON slots based on time misalignment, we randomize the start times of each bit (i.e., the first slot of the MC ON-OFF bit) at both H and D. Specifically, a random time offset ε, which can be positive or negative, is selected from a uniform distribution U(εl, εh). The lower bound εl is chosen to be the maximum synchronization error between D and H. This can be calculated as the expected clock drift over the transmission time of H plus the maximum time difference between path delays. The upper bound εh is set to a reasonable value, such as 2εl. Additionally, τ << t, where t is the slot duration. This ensures the correct sequence decoding.

We attempted to distinguish between D and H using the RSS sampling method discussed in Section 6.1.1. The adversary also canceled slots where D or H’s signals were indistinguishable. Figure 12(d) shows the probability δ of accepting the adversary’s modified message as a function of the number of active helper slots |s| when the message length is ℓ = 20. We observe that δ decreases significantly compared to Figure 12(c). Furthermore, imperfect cancellation (pC < 1) leads to further deterioration of the adversary’s performance. These results support the analytical findings provided in Section 5, which are computed assuming pC = 1.

### Timing Performance

The upper bound on the execution time of the DH (Diffie-Hellman) protocol with HELP primarily depends on the communication time of the ON-OFF keyed message, as the rest of the messages are exchanged in normal communication mode. Public key parameters for an EC-DH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key-agreement [58] can range from 160 to 512 bits, depending on the security requirement. Assuming a hash length of 160 bits and a slot duration of 1 ms, the time required to transmit the HELP-protected DH public primitive varies between 0.6 to 1.4 seconds, which is acceptable.

### Security and Implementation

The legitimate device transmits to the BS and simultaneously transmits at random times to allow the detection of cancellation attacks at the BS. We demonstrated that a pairing protocol such as the DH key agreement protocol, using HELP as an integrity protection primitive, can resist MitM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks without requiring an authenticated channel between D and the BS. This was not previously feasible by any of the pairing methods if signal cancellation was possible. We studied various implementation details of HELP and analyzed its security. Our protocol aims to alleviate the device pairing problem for IoT devices that may not have the appropriate interfaces for entering or pre-loading cryptographic primitives.

### Conclusion

We addressed the problem of pairing two devices using in-band communications in the absence of prior shared secrets. We proposed a new PHY-layer integrity protection scheme called HELP, which is resistant to signal cancellation attacks. Our scheme operates with the assistance of a helper device that has an authenticated channel to the BS. The helper is placed in close proximity to the legitimate device.
