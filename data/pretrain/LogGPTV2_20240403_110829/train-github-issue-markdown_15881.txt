  * Electron version: 1.4.16 1.6.6
  * Operating system: Mac OS 10.11.6
### Expected behavior
When creating a new window, setting property "show" to false should make the
window stay hidden unless show() is called. The window should also send
'ready-to-show' event once its done loading.
### Actual behavior
It works properly unless you set a parent window on Mac OS. On Linux and
Windows it works as expected.
### How to reproduce
    git clone https://github.com/ionphractal/electron-quick-start.git -b mac-show-bug
    cd electron-quick-start
    npm install
    npm start || electron .
