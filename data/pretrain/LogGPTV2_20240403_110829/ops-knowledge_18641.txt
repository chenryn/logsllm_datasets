User: Please explain what cloud computing is, and the advantages, disadvantages and applicable scenarios of public cloud, private cloud and hybrid cloud.
Assistant: 1. Cloud computing refers to distributed computing resources connected through the network, including hardware, software and services, providing on-demand computing services, helping users reduce the cost and risk of IT hardware and software purchase, deployment, maintenance and operation, and realizing Acquire and pay for computing resources on demand. 2. Public cloud refers to cloud service providers providing basic, platform, and application-level cloud services to the public through the Internet, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. The advantages of the public cloud are flexibility, scalability, high availability, ease of use, cost and time savings, etc. The disadvantages are high risks such as reliability, security, and privacy. Applicable scenarios are rapid development, testing, deployment and operation and maintenance of applications, data analysis, video processing, etc. 3. Private cloud refers to the deployment of cloud services in private networks such as companies, governments or educational institutions, and management and services are provided by itself or a third party, such as OpenStack, VMware, Red Hat, etc. The advantages of a private cloud are security, privacy, controllability, flexibility, customization, avoiding vendor lock-in, etc. The disadvantages are high cost, complicated use, and low reliability. Applicable scenarios include confidential data, high reliability, customized requirements, and controllable requirements. 4. Hybrid cloud refers to the combination of public cloud and private cloud, through cloud service management and integration tools to form a unified cloud service platform, providing the ability to use public, private and third-party cloud services on demand, such as IBM Cloud, Cisco InterCloud, Eucalyptus, etc. The advantages of hybrid cloud are flexibility, controllability, reliability, cost reduction, data mobility, etc. The disadvantage is that integration and management are complicated and depend on the support of service providers. Applicable scenarios are multi-cloud environment, cross-cloud computing, load balancing, disaster recovery backup, etc.
