I'm using glide 3.7.0 and can see following:
When I fast scroll in lists which display images and animated gifs, displaying
a gif blocks all further image loading for a short time (visual impression is
that a gif must finish loading before further images are loaded)
**What I tried so far:**
  * A simple change to the gif loading solves the problem (adding `asBitmap` and disable the gif animation therefore) - this is not what I want though
  * giving all the gif request `Priority.LOW` and all others `Priority.NORMAL` \- this does not change anything, although it seems to be what I actually want... It's just not working though...
Is there something different I can do?
**Additional info**
I'm using following disc cache strategy (decided to use this, because of some
other issues here and this was the suggested solution):
    protected static DiskCacheStrategy getStrategy(IMedia media)
    {
        if (media instanceof ILocalMedia) // if media is a local media
        {
            if (media.getMediaType() == MediaType.Gif)
                return DiskCacheStrategy.NONE;
            return DiskCacheStrategy.RESULT;
        }
        else // media is some network media, we must download it, so we need to use some caching
        {
            return DiskCacheStrategy.RESULT;
        }
    }
