**Abstract:**
Dynamic packaging is an innovative technology that allows for the automated online configuration and assembly of customized travel packages for individual customers. While dynamic packaging has gained widespread acceptance in UK and US markets, its strategic implications remain uncertain. This article examines the strategic opportunities enabled by dynamic packaging, highlighting key success factors. We evaluate the current dynamic packaging applications of three major online travel agencies using a developed analysis framework. The results indicate that effective integration of tourism information systems is crucial for realizing the full potential of dynamic packaging. We then discuss Web services and semantic technologies as potential solutions to address interoperability challenges faced by current dynamic packaging applications.

**Keywords:** Dynamic packaging, tourism information systems, integration and interoperability

**Introduction:**
In 2004, the Travel Industry Association of America (TIA, 2005) estimated that 30% of the US adult population used the Internet to obtain travel and destination information. Of this group, 70% booked at least one travel service or product online. Despite the increasing use of the Internet for travel information and bookings, the high expectations of the online travel market have not been fully met. Early optimism about the efficiency of electronic markets focused on increased transparency and lower information search costs, leading to more efficient pricing and reduced price dispersion (Werthner & Klein, 1999). However, various studies have shown that booking travel products online can be time-consuming and often results in less satisfactory prices and package configurations compared to using a traditional travel agency (Anckar & Walden, 2000; Öörni, 2003).

Several factors contribute to these issues. First, the limited availability of price and product information, often requiring a reservation or phone call for detailed information, poses a challenge. Second, the proliferation of websites offering various tourism products has led to a more fragmented and opaque e-tourism market. To improve price and condition comparisons and reduce search costs, some form of "reintermediation" functionality or service is necessary.

Travel agents are also facing changes in the tourism industry, including reduced commission revenues. For example, in 1997, major US airlines reduced the commission rate payable to traditional and online travel agencies from 10% to 8%, and subsequently to 5%. Since 1998, many airlines have implemented zero commissions (Joystar Inc., 2005). Vacation providers are expected to follow suit, further reducing travel agents' profit margins. As a result, travel agents must seek new ways to increase their profit margins, such as by offering dynamically packaged holiday services. This added value allows travel agents to earn their margins through a combination of reduced commissions and booking fees.

According to PhoCusWright, one-third of online travel buyers purchased a vacation package in the previous year, contrasting with the decline in prepackaged tours, which fell from 19% in 2003 to 13% in 2004. Clearly, consumers prefer to create their own packages rather than purchase prepackaged offers. With the growing demand for customized tourism itineraries, agencies are seeking technologies that provide flexibility to assemble unique dynamic packages from a range of alternatives, without the need for clients to understand complex contract rules and pricing issues.

**The Dynamic Packaging Model:**
Dynamic packaging technology enables online travel customers to build and book vacations. It allows customers to combine elements of a trip, such as flights, hotels, car rentals, local tours, and tickets to events, into a single reservation. The package is treated as a single transaction, requiring only one payment from the customer, while hiding the pricing of individual components.

**Business Models for Dynamic Packaging:**
To understand how dynamic packaging can support e-tourism strategies, it is important to consider the business models that can be implemented. Two primary models are the agency model and the merchant model.

1. **Agency Model:**
   - Under the agency model, travel agencies pass customer reservations to suppliers and receive a commission, typically 10%.
   - For example, if a traveler books a hotel room for $150, the travel agency receives $15.
   - According to Starkov and Price (2003), this type of commission is expected to disappear over the next five years, similar to what happened in the airline and car rental sectors.

2. **Merchant Model:**
   - The merchant model involves buying inventory (e.g., hotel rooms, airline seats) at wholesale rates and reselling them to consumers at retail prices.
   - For example, a travel agency might buy a $150 hotel room for $120 and resell it for $140, making a $20 profit.
   - This model allows for higher profit margins but entails higher risks due to the need to manage unsold inventory.

**Strategic Opportunities and Challenges:**
The main opportunities and challenges of dynamic packaging for different industry participants (travel service suppliers, customers, and travel agencies) are summarized in Table 1.

**Table 1: Overview of Opportunities and Challenges of Dynamic Packaging Applications for Different Industry Participants**

| Market Participants | Opportunities | Challenges |
|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| Suppliers           | Flexibility: Integrated systems allow short-term adaptation of offers and prices to market changes. <br> Market expansion: New ways of combining a supplier’s product with other travel services can expand the market and increase revenues. | Initial investments: Additional investments are necessary to support an integrated IS infrastructure. <br> Increasing dynamic markets: Quick adaptations of offers and prices are required. |
| Customers           | Targeted offers: Assembled travel packages are better tailored to individual needs. <br> Better service: Consistent collection of customer data allows for better customer service. | Less transparent pricing: It is more difficult for customers to compare prices if only one price is given for an entire package. <br> Unasserted quality: Individually assembled packages make quality assurance of the entire package difficult. |
| Traditional Travel Agencies | Better customer service: More targeted consulting for (prospective) customers. <br> Flexibility: Dynamic packaging allows for presenting prices that reflect current market conditions. | Initial investments: Additional investments are necessary to support an integrated IS infrastructure. <br> Increasing competition: Web portals applying dynamic packaging enter the market as new competitors. |

**Requirements for Dynamic Packaging Applications:**
To effectively implement dynamic packaging, several requirements must be met:

1. **Integration and Interoperability:**
   - Effective integration of distributed tourism and travel information systems is crucial.
   - Current dynamic packaging applications use a hard-coded approach, which does not comply with the highly dynamic and decentralized nature of the tourism industry.
   - New technologies, such as Web services and semantic technologies, can enable a more integrated solution, allowing for loosely coupled software components and semantically enriched data descriptions.

2. **Customer-Centric Customization:**
   - Dynamic packaging should allow for the customization of travel packages based on individual customer preferences and current market conditions.
   - The search and selection process should be customizable according to customer preferences.

3. **Cost Efficiency:**
   - Using the Internet as a sales channel significantly reduces transaction costs, including negotiation costs.

**Conclusion and Future Work:**
This article provides a framework for assessing the strategic opportunities and challenges of dynamic packaging in e-tourism. The key success factor is the effective integration of tourism information systems. Web services and semantic technologies offer promising solutions to address interoperability challenges. Future work will focus on developing and testing these technologies in real-world scenarios to further enhance the strategic benefits of dynamic packaging.
