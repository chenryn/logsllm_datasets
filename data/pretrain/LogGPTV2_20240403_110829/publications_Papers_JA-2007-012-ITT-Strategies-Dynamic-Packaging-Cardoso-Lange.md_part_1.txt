Dynamic packaging has been introduced as an innovative technology allowing for the automated
online configuration and assembling of packaged travel products for individual customers. While
dynamic packaging has been widely accepted by customers in UK and US markets, the possible
strategic impacts enabled by dynamic packaging technologies are still uncertain. This article pro-
vides a study of the strategic opportunities enabled by dynamic packaging, highlighting the key
successfactors.Currentdynamicpackagingapplicationsofthethreemajoronlinetravelagencies
are evaluated on the basis of the developed analysis framework. The results show that an appro-
priate level of integration of tourism information systems is a key factor for further realizing the
strategic opportunities of dynamic packaging. We then discuss Web services and semantics as a
possible solution for overcoming the interoperability problems that (current) dynamic packaging
applicationsface.
