Another way to fool SNOOPDOG is by injecting noise into the
device’s wireless trafﬁc at random intervals for some time win-
dow. Since SNOOPDOG utilizes the change in device trafﬁc
to ascertain a cause-effect relationship, the variations caused
by injecting random noise are able to fool the detection.
Devices that do not transmit continuously can randomly
send information that creates a pattern similar to their inferred
event trafﬁc. This way they can keep sending their information
which is hidden within random trafﬁc. We add random noise
which appears like regular trafﬁc for a motion sensor in Figure
10.
8.3 Constantly Vary the Resolution of the
Data Being Transmitted
For devices like camera, there are several video resolutions
that an adversary can choose. The higher the resolution, the
better the video quality is. However, if an adversary chooses
a scheme where the video resolution is constantly varying,
it will cause random changes in the network trafﬁc. Hence,
even if the user’s motion is causing changes to the trafﬁc, it
is overpowered by the changes in network trafﬁc due to a
variation in resolution.
For RF sensors, they can vary the number of maximum
points that they transmit continuously to achieve a similar

that can scan their probable frequencies and sniff their packets
to ﬁnd if any devices are transmitting and 2) the ability to
ﬁnd unique device IDs from packet headers and distinguish-
ing header information from payload size. While capturing
Zigbee/Z-Wave packets will require additional hardware, re-
cent works have shown that it is possible for a Wi-Fi radio to
perform cross-technology communication. [45, 46]
10 Discussion
Q1: What is the usability of SNOOPDOG? We envision
SNOOPDOG to be implemented as an app on either a smart-
phone or a smartwatch (or a combination of the two). This
means an end-user will not need any prior knowledge about
causality and coverage of a device to use it. SNOOPDOG will
continuously work in the background to look for a cause-
effect relationship between a user’s actions and device trafﬁc.
It will then guide a user step-by-step through the entire lo-
calization procedure. Since an adversary can place a sensor
at any time (e.g.,when a user checks in a room, searches for
devices, ﬁnds none and then leaves for dinner after which the
adversary places the spying device), SNOOPDOG will still
ﬁnd it because it continuously works in the background. This
will not cause any overhead in terms of user involvement.
Q2: How can false positives be reduced? For false positive
to occur during active detection, the device’s trafﬁc needs to
map directly to the S5 motion during the active phase and
user’s motion during the background phase, which is unlikely.
If there happens to be another camera in an adjacent space
monitoring another user who is performing the detection trial
within the same time window as the ﬁrst user, it will trigger
a false detection. However, the probability of this happening
is low. Nevertheless, it remains a possibility, and mitigating
such instances are highly desirable.
Simple strategies can signiﬁcantly reduce the chances of
false positives. First, during the initial monitoring phase for
wireless devices, any periodic trends in trafﬁc patterns can
be noted; the detector trial should ensure its periods are not
synchronous with such periodicity. Furthermore, the detection
process can be done multiple times with varying and erratic
period lengths. This will drastically decrease the chances of
a false positive, as a device would have to coincidentally fol-
low this effectively random trafﬁc pattern. Finally, the entire
process itself can be performed repeatedly; each iteration
compounds the decrease in false positive rate, such that it
eventually reduces to a statistical impossibility.
Q3: Are there alternative approaches to causality? One al-
ternative approach to detecting snooping sensors is correla-
tion. However, correlation does not imply causation. If we
have a sensor that measures the ground truth in the modal-
ity we want to detect, we need to use causality analysis. For
example, it takes the camera some time to process the infor-
mation and send it over to the server. So if we capture human

effect.
8.4 Adding a tape/broadcast delay to the
transmissions
An adversary can add a tape delay to the sensor transmissions,
i.e. intentionally adding a delay between when something
was recorded and when it was transmitted. Since, we are
only looking for causality within a small time window, a
high tape delay will be able to fool SNOOPDOG . However,
given enough storage capacity and time, it is possible for
SNOOPDOG to scan the entire recording to look for cause-
effect relationship with user motion. But for large tape delays,
this is not practical.
9 Limitations
1: Only limited to VBR devices. Although SNOOPDOG can
detect a wide variety of commonly available sensors, it cannot
detect any wireless sensor monitoring the user. For a sensor to
be detectable by SNOOPDOG, the trafﬁc must be encoded with
a Variable Bit Rate (VBR) algorithm and the data recorded
by the sensor must change in response to user perturbation
which can be recorded by a ground truth sensor. That said,
most surveillance devices such as cameras, motion sensors
and smart-home assistants today fall into this category, and
thus we believe SNOOPDOG can serve as a valid defense.
2: A technically capable adversary can fool SNOOPDOG
if they know about its existence. If the adversary suspects
SNOOPDOG is in use, they can use one of the techniques
listed in Section 8. They can also use channel hopping or
MAC randomization. We have not evaluated SNOOPDOG for
any of the above techniques.
3: Evaluation is limited to Wi-Fi devices and devices who
route their trafﬁc through a Wi-Fi-hub only. We have eval-
uated SNOOPDOG for Wi-Fi-connected devices only. For fu-
ture work, this framework can be evaluated for other popular
wireless communication standards. SNOOPDOG can be ex-
tended to standards like Zigbee [41], Z-Wave [42], and Blue-

motion with an IMU, the camera trafﬁc will lag the IMU time
series. This is correctly captured by causality analysis but not
by correlation. However, if instead of using a sensor to mea-
sure the ground truth, we use another sensor that can capture
the same modality that we are trying to detect, we can use
correlation because if both the devices are capturing the same
event, their trafﬁc should show similar trends. Future work
can also explore the efﬁcacy of data-driven approaches such
as deep learning for time series classiﬁcation.
Q4: Can we detect continuously streaming audio bugs?
There are two ways to encode audio, either constant bit rate
(CBR) or variable bit rate (VBR). VBR techniques make use
of similarity in sound, such as prolonged silence, to reduce
the amount of data required for encoding. In contrast, CBR
always encodes with the same number of bits. Many off-the-
shelf audio recorders and audio streaming apps use CBR.
Since SNOOPDOG only has access to the payload size of a
packet, there must be variation in the payload to determine
causality. Hence, SNOOPDOG cannot detect CBR audio bugs.
Q5: What is the impact of a ground-truth sensor? Qualita-
tively, the ground-truth sensor enables the detection of causal-
ity between human action and hidden sensors. Even if all hid-
den devices were connected to an accessible Wi-Fi network
(which is the same system model used by IoTInspector [8]),
one would only be able to detect the presence of a device on
the network and not whether it is monitoring a user. To quanti-
tatively demonstrate and evaluate the impact of a ground-truth
sensor, Figure 3 illustrates an example where an IMU enables
SNOOPDOG to identify between a hidden sensor monitoring
a user and disregard a camera in a separate room. Moreover,
one may argue that an application can actively instruct the
user to move and establish causality between the period of
instruction and the Wi-Fi trafﬁc patterns. First, such an ap-
proach relies on a general user motion model to establish
causality during these time frames. Second, this approach is
not capable of background detection as it would rely on active
command and response patterns. In Table 3 case 1, without
a ground truth sensor, the false positive rate is 100%. With a
ground truth sensor, this decreases to 6.66%.

This section presents the most relevant and related works.
Detecting hidden devices using RF signals. A popular tool
to detect hidden devices is called a bug detector [47] – an RF
receiver that can sense if the received power in a frequency
range is above a threshold. The problem with such devices is
that they can produce false alarms when used near other RF
sources such as mobile phones or laptops [17, 18]. Also, they
give no additional information about the type of device or
where it is located. After detection, the onus lies completely
on the user to physically ﬁnd the device and verify if it is
a surveillance device or not. The host may have a wireless
device to monitor the power consumption of his property, but
to the bug detector, it would seem similar to an IP camera.
Classifying devices on the network using wireless trafﬁc
snifﬁng. While services like Princeton IoT Inspector [8] col-
lect trafﬁc statistics to identify the types of devices present on
the network, they fail to identify if those devices are indeed
spying on the user or not. Just ascertaining the presence of a
surveillance device is not enough. The device may be present
outside the house or it may be monitoring some part of the
house which was already disclosed by the home owner. In
cases like this, just identifying such a device exists is not
enough, we also need to determine two important facets – is
the device spying on the user and is it located in an area of the
house that has the potential to violate user privacy. Moreover,
tools like this need to have access to the network in order to
be effective. If the snooping devices are placed in a hidden
network or on a password protected network, the use cases of
such a tool are limited.
Other network trafﬁc analysis tools [48, 49] utilize trafﬁc
data to ﬁnd which devices are consuming high bandwidth.
Such techniques can be used to classify audio and video data
streams present in the wireless networks. However, with an
increase in streaming services [50, 51], it is difﬁcult to distin-
guish camera video and audio ﬂows with those of streaming
services based on just their bandwidth usage.
Detecting cameras on the network using wireless trafﬁc
snifﬁng. Wampler et al. [9] and others [10, 11] show that in-
formation leakage occurs in camera trafﬁc due to how videos
are encoded. They observe that changing lighting conditions
cause noticeable variations in the network trafﬁc. Though
these techniques perform well, their performance degrades
when the environment lighting changes naturally. Addition-
ally, while these techniques work well for a camera, they do
not generalize to other types of snooping devices, like RF
sensors or motion detectors. Finally, in order to be able to
change the lighting conditions of a space, the user requires
either specialized hardware (like an LED board or a bulb) or
access to lighting controls, which is not guaranteed.
Approaches like DewiCam [13] exploit the correlation be-
tween human motion and camera data ﬂows to determine if
the camera is indoors or outdoors.
In [12], Wu et al. use their own camera to record a scene
while simultaneously snifﬁng the network trafﬁc. They com-
pare the data rate and pattern of their camera with other de-
vices in the network to look for any similarities. If a similarity
exists, there is a high probability that the device is a camera.
Localizing wireless devices using RSSI. Received Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) is the estimate of the power re-
ceived at the receiver from the transmitting device. The power
received drops with distance, and so does the RSSI. This
property is leveraged to localize devices using RSSI [52–55].
However, due to phenomenon like multipath and shadowing,
the accuracy varies from space to space [56]. The error is very
high (several meters). For small rooms, such a result will be
meaningless, as the snooping device can be effectively hidden

12 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented SNOOPDOG, a framework to de-
tect, identify, and localize Wi-Fi based sensors monitoring
a person in an arbitrary space. SNOOPDOG works by es-
tablishing causality between a set of ground truth sensors
monitoring a user and the transmitted information of wireless
devices on a Wi-Fi network. It then uses this causality to
perform trial-based localization. We implement SNOOPDOG
on a set of commonly available devices such as a smartphone
and a laptop and evaluate our solution on a set of represen-
tative clandestine sensors. The framework had a detection
rate of 95.2% when the injected multi-modal event was hu-
man motion or sound. SNOOPDOG leverages directionality
of snooping sensors to reduce the total search area.
