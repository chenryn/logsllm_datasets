ABSTRACT
Recent research eﬀorts to design better Internet transport
protocols combined with scalable Active Queue Manage-
ment (AQM) have led to signiﬁcant advances in congestion
control. One of the hottest topics in this area is the design
of discrete congestion control algorithms that are asymptot-
ically stable under heterogeneous feedback delay and whose
control equations do not explicitly depend on the RTTs of
end-ﬂows. In this paper, we show that max-min fair con-
gestion control methods with a stable symmetric Jacobian
remain stable under arbitrary feedback delay (including het-
erogeneous directional delays) and that the stability condi-
tion of such methods does not involve any of the delays.
To demonstrate the practicality of the obtained result, we
change the original controller in Kelly’s work [14] to become
robust under random feedback delay and ﬁxed constants of
the control equation. We call the resulting framework Max-
min Kelly Control (MKC) and show that it oﬀers smooth
sending rate, exponential convergence to eﬃciency, and fast
convergence to fairness, all of which make it appealing for
future high-speed networks.

[29] to the more exciting developments based on optimiza-
tion theory [22], [23], game theory [10], [18], and control the-
ory [9], [10], [24], [25]. It is widely recognized that TCP’s
congestion control in its current shape is inadequate for very
high-speed networks and ﬂuctuation-sensitive real-time mul-
timedia. Thus, a signiﬁcant research eﬀort is currently under
way (e.g., [5], [6], [8], [11], [14], [15], [18], [27]) to better un-
derstand the desirable properties of congestion control and
develop new algorithms that can be deployed in future AQM
(Active Queue Management) networks.
One of the most important factors in the design of conges-
tion control is its asymptotic stability, which is the capacity
of the protocol to avoid oscillations in the steady-state and
properly respond to external perturbations caused by the
arrival/departure of ﬂows, variation in feedback, and other
transient eﬀects. Stability proofs for distributed congestion
control become progressively more complicated as feedback
delays are taken into account, which is especially true for
the case of heterogeneous delays where each user i receives
its network feedback delayed by a random amount of time
Di. Many existing papers (e.g., [4], [9], [10], [11], [16], [17],
[18], [23]) model all users with homogeneous delay Di = D
and do not take into account the fact that end-users in real
networks are rarely (if ever) synchronized. Several recent
studies [19], [24], [26] successfully deal with heterogeneous
delays; however, they model Di as a deterministic metric
and require that end-ﬂows (and sometimes routers) dynam-
ically adapt their equations based on feedback delays, which
leads to RTT-unfairness, increased overhead, and other side-
eﬀects (such as probabilistic stability).
In this paper, we set our goal to build a discrete conges-
tion control system that maintains both stability and fair-
ness under heterogeneously delayed feedback, allows users
to use ﬁxed parameters of the control equation, and admits
a low-overhead implementation inside routers. We solve
this problem by showing that any max-min fair system with
a stable symmetric Jacobian remains asymptotically stable
under arbitrary directional delays and apply this result to
the original controller proposed by Kelly et al. [14]. We call
the result of these eﬀorts Max-min Kelly Control (MKC)
and demonstrate that its stability and fairness do not de-
pend on any parameters of the network (such as delay, path
length, or the routing matrix of end-users). We also show
that with a proper choice of AQM feedback, MKC converges
to eﬃciency exponentially fast, exhibits stability and fair-
ness under random delays, converges to fairness almost as
quickly as AIMD, and does not require routers to estimate
any parameters of individual ﬂows.
Session 8: Congestion ControlBy isolating bottlenecks along each path and responding
only to the most-congested resource, the MKC framework
allows for very simple stability proofs, which we hope will
lead to a better understanding of Kelly’s framework in the
systems community and eventually result in an actual im-
plementation of these methods in real networks. Our initial
thrust in this direction includes ns2 simulations of MKC,
which show that ﬁnite time-averaging of ﬂow rates inside
each router coupled with a naive implementation of end-user
functions leads to undesirable transient oscillations, which
become more pronounced when directional delays D→
i and
D←
to/from each router increase. We overcome this draw-
back with simple changes at each end-user and conﬁrm that
the theoretically predicted monotonic convergence of MKC
is achievable in real networks, even when the routers do not
know the exact combined rate of end-ﬂows at any time in-
stant n. We also show that our algorithms inside the router
incur low overhead (which is less than that in XCP [11] or
RED [7]) and require only one addition per arriving packet
and two variables per router queue.

2. BACKGROUND
A large amount of theoretical and experimental work is
being conducted to design stable congestion controls for
high-speed networks. Such examples include FAST TCP
[8], HSTCP [5], Scalable TCP [15], BIC-TCP [28], and XCP
[11], all of which aim to achieve quick convergence to eﬃ-
ciency, stable rate trajectories, fair bandwidth sharing, and
low packet loss. An entirely diﬀerent direction in congestion
control is to model the network from an optimization or
game-theoretic point of view [10], [16], [17], [18], [23]. The
original work by Kelly et al. [13], [14] oﬀers an economic in-
terpretation of the resource-user model, in which the entire
system achieves its optimal performance by maximizing the
individual utility of each end-user. To implement this model
in a decentralized network, Kelly et al. describe two algo-
rithms (primal and dual ) and prove their global stability in
the absence of feedback delay. However, if feedback delay is
present in the control loop, stability analysis of Kelly con-
trols is non-trivial and currently forms an active research
area [4], [9], [19], [24], [26], [27].
Recall that in Kelly’s framework [14], [24], each user i ∈
[1, N ] is given a unique route ri that consists of one or more
network resources (routers). Feedback delays in the network
are heterogeneous and directional. The forward and back-
ward delays between user i and resource j are denoted by
D→
ij and D←
ij , respectively. Thus, the round-trip delay of
user i is the summation of its forward and backward delays
with respect to any router j ∈ ri: Di = D→
ij . Un-
der this framework, Johari et al. discretize Kelly’s primal
algorithm as follows [9]:
xi(n) = xi(n−1)+κi

where κi is a strictly positive gain parameter, ωi can be
interpreted as the willingness of user i to pay the price for
using the network, and µj(n) is the congestion indication
function of resource j:

where sj denotes the set of users sharing resource j and

a notation in which Di = 1 means immediate (i.e., most
recent) feedback and Di ≥ 2 implies delayed feedback.
Next, recall that for a homogeneous delay D, system (1)-
(2) is locally stable if [9]:

For heterogeneous delays, a combination of conjectures

the proofs of Vinnicombe [26] suggest that delay D in (3)
can be simply replaced with individual delays Di to form
a system of N stability equations; however, the proof ex-
ists only for the continuous version of (1) and leads to the

We should also note that Ying et al. [30] recently estab-
lished delay-independent stability conditions for a family of
utility functions and a generalized controller (1). Their work
is similar in spirit to ours; however, the analysis and pro-
posed methods are diﬀerent.
3. CLASSIC KELLY CONTROL
In this section, we ﬁrst discuss intuitive examples that
explain the cryptic formulas in the previous section and
demonstrate in simulation how delays aﬀect stability of Kelly
controls (1)-(2). We then show that Kelly’s proportional
fairness [14], or any mechanism that relies on the sum of
feedback functions from individual routers, always exhibits
linear convergence to eﬃciency. Note that due to limited
space, we omit certain proofs and refer the reader to the
technical report [31] for more information.
3.1 Delayed Stability Example
The following example illustrates stability problems of (1)
when feedback delays are large. We assume a single-source,
single-link conﬁguration and utilize a standard congestion
indication function, which computes the estimated packet
loss using instantaneous arrival rates:
x(n) − C
p(n) =
,
x(n)
(5)
where C is the link capacity and x(n) is the ﬂow rate at dis-
crete step n. We remark that under AQM feedback assumed
throughout the paper, we allow negative packet loss in (5),
which signals the ﬂows to increase their sending rates when
x(n) < C. In section 5.1, we show that the negative com-
ponent of packet-loss (5) improves convergence to eﬃciency
from linear to exponential.

Applying (5) to Kelly control (1) yields a linear end-ﬂow
equation:
x(n) = x(n − 1) + κω − κ
x(n − D) − C
.

(cid:162)
Next, assume a particular set of parameters: κ = 1/2,
ω = 10 mb/s, and C = 1, 000 mb/s. Solving the condition
in (3), we have that the system is stable if and only if delay
D is less than four time units. As illustrated in Figure 1(a),
delay D = 1 keeps the system stable and monotonically con-
vergent to its stationary point. Under larger delays D = 2
and D = 3 in Figures 1(b) and (c), the ﬂow exhibits pro-
gressively increasing oscillations before entering the steady
state. Eventually, as soon as D becomes equal to four time
units, the system diverges as shown in Figure 1(d).
Using the same parameter κ and reducing ω to 20 kb/s,
we examine (6) via ns2 simulations, in which a single ﬂow
passes through a link of capacity 50 mb/s. We run the ﬂow in
two network conﬁgurations with the round-trip delay equal
to 90 ms and 120 ms, respectively. As seen in Figure 2,
the ﬁrst ﬂow reaches its steady state after decaying oscil-
lations, while the second ﬂow exhibits no convergence and
periodically overshoots capacity C by 200%.
Since Kelly controls are unstable unless condition (3) is
satisﬁed [9], a natural strategy to maintain stability is for
each end-user i to adaptively adjusts its gain parameter κi ∼
1/Di such that (3) is not violated. However, this method
depends on reliable estimation of round-trip delays Di and
