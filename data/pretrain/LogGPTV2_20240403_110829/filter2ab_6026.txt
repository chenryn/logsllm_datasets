**ATT&CK ID:** T1566.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Spearphishing Link

Adversaries may use spearphishing emails containing malicious links as a tactic to gain unauthorized access to victim systems. This specific variant of spearphishing, known as "Spearphishing Link," differs from other forms in that it relies on the inclusion of URLs within the email, which, when clicked, lead to the download of malware. This approach is often used to evade security measures that focus on inspecting email attachments for malicious content. 

Spearphishing attacks frequently employ social engineering techniques, such as impersonating a trusted source, to increase the likelihood of the recipient clicking on the malicious link. By leveraging these deceptive tactics, attackers can bypass traditional security defenses and compromise the target's system.
