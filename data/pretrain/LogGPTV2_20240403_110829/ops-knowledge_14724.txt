In the terminal, you can view the SSH login log by executing the command journalctl -u ssh or cat /var/log/auth.log | grep sshd. The method to prevent malicious IP login can be to restrict IP access through the firewall, modify the SSH service configuration file to restrict IP access or use Fail2ban to prevent SSH brute force cracking.
