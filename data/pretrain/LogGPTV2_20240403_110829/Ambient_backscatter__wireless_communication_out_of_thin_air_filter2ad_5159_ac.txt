sending the actual preamble. The alternating bit sequence is long
enough (8 bits in our implementation) to wake up the digital hard-
ware, which then uses traditional mechanisms to detect bit bound-
aries and perform framing.
4.2 Link Layer
Next we describe the following aspects of an ambient backscat-
ter link layer design: error detection, acknowledgments, and carrier
sense for mediating access to the channel.
Fig. 7 depicts the high-level packet format for ambient backscat-
ter systems. The packet starts with a few bits of the preamble that
are used to wake up the receiver’s hardware; the rest of the pream-
ble is then used by the receiver to detect the beginning of a packet.
The preamble is followed by a header containing the type of packet
(data/ACK), destination and source addresses, and the length of the
packet. This is followed immediately by the packet’s data. Both the
header and the data include CRCs, which the receiver can use to de-
tect bit errors in either ﬁeld. Data may also be protected using sim-
ple error correction codes that do not consume signiﬁcant power,
e.g., hamming codes, repetition codes, etc. [33]. The receiver suc-
cessfully receives a packet when both the CRC checks pass. It then
sends back an acknowledgment within a pre-set time that is deter-
mined by the time it takes to successfully decode the packet at the
receiver and switch to a transmitting state. In the rest of this section,
we design carrier sense to arbitrate the wireless medium between
these backscattering transmitters.
4.2.1 Carrier Sense
The discussion so far focuses on the communication aspects of
a single ambient backscattering transmitter-receiver pair. However,
when many of these devices are in range of each other, we need
mechanisms to arbitrate the channel between them. In traditional
RFID, a centralized, powered reader performs the task of an arbitra-
tor for the wireless medium. Ambient backscatter communication,
however, cannot rely on such a powered reader and thus requires a
different set of mechanisms to provide media access control.
The advantage we have over traditional backscatter is that ambi-
ent backscattering devices can decode each other’s transmissions.
Thus, they can potentially perform carrier sense: detect the begin-
ning of other packet transmissions (preamble correlation), and de-
tect energy in the middle of a packet transmission (energy detec-
tion). Preamble correlation for carrier sense is operationally similar
to that performed by the receiver for decoding packets. Energy de-
tection, however, is challenging because the digital hardware does
not have access to the power levels.
To see this, let us look at communication systems like WiFi
where energy detection is performed by computing the average
power in the signal and detecting a packet when the average power
is greater than a threshold. Such operations require a full ADC
to get the digital samples on which to operate. Since an ambient
backscattering device does not have access to a full ADC it does
not have access to these power levels.
We show that one can perform energy detection by leveraging
the property of the analog comparator. Speciﬁcally, unlike a tradi-
tional receiver where, even in the absence of nearby transmitters,
it sees random changes in the received signal due to environmen-
tal noise; the bits output by our analog comparator are constant in
the absence of a backscattering transmitter. This is because, as de-
scribed in §4.1, the analog comparator has a minimum threshold
below which it does not register any changes. Since the averaging
circuit smoothens out the variations in the ambient signals, they
typically do not create signal changes that are above this threshold.
This means that in the absence of a nearby backscattering transmit-
ter, the comparator typically outputs either a constant sequence of
ones or a constant sequence of zeros. A nearby transmission, on the
other hand, results in changes that are greater than the comparator’s
threshold and therefore bit transitions at the comparator’s output.
Since the transmitted bits have an equal number of ones and zeros
(due to FM0 encoding), the comparator outputs the same number
of ones and zeros. Thus comparing the number of ones and zeros
allows the receiver to distinguish between the presence and absence
of a backscatter transmission. More formally, the receiver performs
energy detection by using the following equation:
44D = 1 −
|#ones − #zeros|
#ones + #zeros
where #ones and #zeros denote the number of zeros and ones
seen at the receiver over some time interval. In the presence of a
backscattering transmitter, the average number of ones and zeros
is about the same, and hence D is close to one. But in the absence
of any close-by backscattering transmitters, the bits output by the
comparator are either mostly ones or mostly zeros; thus, D is close
to zero. Our results in §6 show that the above ideas hold even with
mobility and in dynamic environments.
We note that the transmitter performs carrier sense only when it
has data to transmit and before it starts transmitting. Upon detection
of a competing transmission, microcontrollers (including the one
used in our prototype) are able to sleep for the duration of the packet
by masking interrupts caused by bit transitions.3 Thus, the power
drain of the above operations is minimal.
4.3 Further Discussion
So far we described the key functionalities (carrier sense, start-
of-frame detection, etc.) required to build a network out of ambient
backscatter devices. However, there are optimizations that can in-
crease the performance of such systems; We outline some of them:
(a) Multiple bit-rates: Our current prototypes operate at a speciﬁc
bit rate (either 100 bps, 1 kbps or 10 kbps). In principle, one can
design a single device that has demodulators for different rates and
switches between them. Further, one can design rate adaptation al-
gorithms that adapt the rate to the channel conditions and can sig-
niﬁcantly increase the performance.
(b) Collision Avoidance: Carrier sense enables MAC protocols like
CSMA that allow devices to share the medium. One can further
reduce the number of collisions by designing collision avoidance
mechanisms. Prior work on random number generation on low-
power RFIDs [12] can, in principle, be leveraged to achieve this.
(c) Hidden Terminals: The devices can, in principle, use the RTS-
CTS mechanism to address the hidden terminal problem. The over-
head of RTS-CTS can be reduced by stripping the RTS-CTS mes-
sages of the data and header information, and having the transmit-
ter send a unique preamble to denote the RTS message; the re-
ceiver sends back another unique preamble as a CTS message. Any
nodes that hears these messages will not transmit for a ﬁxed pre-
determined amount of time, i.e., the time required to transmit the
data packet and receive the ACK.
5. PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION
We implement our prototype on a 4-layer printed circuit board
(PCB) using off-the-shelf circuit components. The PCB was de-
signed using Altium design software and was manufactured by Sun-
stone Circuits. A total of 20 boards were ordered at a cost of $900.
The circuit components were hand-soldered on the PCBs and indi-
vidually tested which required a total of 50 man-hours. As shown
in Fig. 2, the prototype uses a dipole antenna that consists of two 2
sections of 5.08 in long 16 AWG magnetic copper wire. The proto-
type’s harvesting and communication components are tuned to use
UHF TV signals in the 50 MHz band centered at 539 MHz4.
The transmitter is implemented using the ADG902 RF switch [3]
connected directly to the antenna. The packets sent by the trans-
3To further minimize power, the microcontroller can sleep through
the entire back-off interval, if we use non-persistent CSMA [14].
4To target a wider range of frequencies, one can imagine using a
frequency-agile, auto-tuning harvester that autonomously selects
locally available channels, with a design similar to the dual-band
RFID tag in [34].

mitter follow the format shown in Fig. 7. Further, it is capable of
transmitting packets at three different rates: 100 bps, 1 kbps, and
10 kbps. We also implement both preamble correlation and energy
detection in digital logic to perform carrier sense at the transmitter.
Our implementation currently does not use error correction codes
and has a ﬁxed 96-bit data payload with a 64-bit preamble.
Our implementation of the receiver circuit, described in §3.3,
uses TS881 [8], which is an ultra-low-power comparator. The out-
put of the comparator is fed to the MSP430 microcontroller which
performs preamble correlation, decodes the header/data and ver-
iﬁes the validity of the packet using CRC. We implement dif-
ferent bit rates by setting the capacitor and resistor values, R1,
R2, C1, and C2 in Fig. 6, to (150 kΩ, 10 MΩ, 27 nF, 200 nF)
for 100 bps, (150 kΩ, 10 MΩ, 4.7 nF, 10 nF) for 1 kbps, and
(150 kΩ, 10 MΩ, 680 pF, 1 µ F) for 10 kbps.
Table 1 compares the power consumption of the analog portion
of our transmitter/receiver with that of the WISP, an RFID-based
platform[33]. The table shows that the power consumption num-
bers for ambient backscatter are better than the WISP platform, and
almost negligible given the power budget of our device. This is be-
cause ambient backscatter operates at lower rates (10 kbps) when
compared to existing backscatter systems like the WISP, which op-
erates at 256 kbps. So, we were able to optimize the power con-
sumption of our prototype and achieve lower power consumption
values.
Our prototype also includes two sensing and I/O capabilities for
our proof-of-concept applications that are controlled by the micro-
controller: low-power ﬂashing LEDs and capacitive touch buttons
implemented on the PCB using a copper layer. However, these sen-
sors as well as the microcontroller that drives them can signiﬁ-
cantly add to the power drain. In fact, in the smart card application
(see §7.1), the transmit modulator consumed less than 1% of the
total system power, while the demodulator required another 1%;
demonstrating that ambient backscatter signiﬁcantly reduces the
communication power consumption. The power management cir-
cuitry required an additional 8% of the total power. Flashing the
LEDs and polling the touch sensors at the intervals used in §7.1
consumed 26% of the total power. The remaining 64% was con-
sumed by the microcontroller.5
We note that in scenarios where the TV signal strength is weak,
our prototype uses duty cycling to power the sensors and the micro-
controller. Speciﬁcally, when the prototype is in the sleep mode, it
only harvests RF signals and stores it on a storage capacitor. Once
enough energy has been accumulated on the capacitor, it goes into
active mode and performs the required operations. In hardware, the
duty cycle is implemented by a voltage supervisor that outputs a
high digital value (indicating active mode) when the voltage on the
storage capacitor is greater than 1.8 V.
5We note that the high power consumption for the digital circuit
(i.e., microcontroller) is an artifact of our prototype implementa-
tion. Speciﬁcally, the microcontroller is a general-purpose device
that is not typically used in commercial ultra-low-power devices.
Instead, commercial systems use Application-Speciﬁc Integrated
Circuits (ASICs) that can consume orders of magnitude less power
than general-purpose solutions [25, 33]. In ASIC-based low-power
devices, the power consumption of the analog components often
dominates that of the digital circuit [10].
456. EVALUATION
We evaluate our prototype design in the Seattle metropolitan area
in the presence of a TV tower broadcasting in the 536-542 MHz
range. We ran experiments at six total locations to account for at-
tenuation of the TV signal and multipath effects in different envi-
ronments. The TV signal power in the 6MHz target band for the
given locations ranged between -24 dBm and -8 dBm. These loca-
tions consist of:
• Location 1 (Indoor and near): Inside an apartment 0.31 mi away
from the TV tower. The apartment is on the seventh ﬂoor of a
large complex with 140 units and is located in a busy neighbor-
hood of a metropolitan area.
• Location 2 (Indoor and far): Inside an ofﬁce building 2.57 mi
away from the TV tower. The ofﬁce tested is on the sixth ﬂoor of
the building.
• Location 3 (Outdoor and near): On the rooftop of the above
apartment.
• Location 4 (Outdoor and far): On the rooftop of the above ofﬁce
building.
• Location 5 (Outdoor and farther): On a street corner 5.16 mi
away from the TV tower.
• Location 6 (Outdoor and farthest): On the top level of a parking
structure 6.50 mi away from the TV tower.
We evaluate the various aspects of our design including our am-
bient backscattering transmitter and receiver, carrier sense, and in-
terference at TV receivers. Most of our experiments were limited
to locations 1-4 due to limited extended access to space in loca-
tions 5 and 6. The latter two locations, however, were included to
demonstrate that ambient backscatter can operate at longer ranges
and were tested using our smart card application.
Those test veriﬁed that we were able to get our end-to-end sys-
tem to operate battery-free up to 6.5 mi away from the TV tower.
Note, however, that the operational distance of our prototype is de-
pendent on the operating voltage of the device. In our prototype, the
bottleneck was the microcontroller, which requires 1.8 V. In prin-
ciple, an ASIC-based design should work with much lower voltage
requirements and hence can operate at farther distances.
6.1 Effectiveness of Ambient Backscattering
The effectiveness of a backscattering transmitter is determined
by the extent to which it affects the received signal. To quantify
this, we compute the ratio of the received power, after averaging,
between the non-reﬂecting and reﬂecting states of the transmitter.
Speciﬁcally, if P1 and P2, P1 ≥ P2, are the two average power
levels at the receiver, we compute the ratio, P1
. A ratio close to one
P2
means that the receiver cannot distinguish between the two power
levels; while a higher ratio increases the ability of the receiver to
distinguish between them.
Experiments: We conﬁgure our prototype to send an alternating
sequence of bits—switching between reﬂecting and non-reﬂecting
states—at a rate of 100 bps. The results are similar for the other
bit rates. Since our receiver prototype does not provide the exact
power values, we instead use an USRP-N210 as a receiver to com-
pute the power ratio between the two states. The USRP is connected
to the same dipole antenna used by our receiver prototype to en-
sure that the antenna gains are identical. We conﬁgure the USRP
to gather raw signals centered at 539 MHz using a bandwidth of
6.25 MHz—the bandwidth of the ambient TV signals. We average
the received signal, as described in §3.3, and compute the ratio be-
tween the two average power levels. We repeat the experiments for
different distances (from 0.5 feet to 3 feet) between the transmitter
and the receiver in locations 1-4.

Power Ratio
Figure 8—Performance of an ambient backscattering transmit-
ter: The x-axis plots a CDF of the ratio of the average power
received during the reﬂecting and non-reﬂecting states of the
backscattering transmitter. The CDF is taken across multiple po-
sitions in both indoor/outdoor and near/far scenarios.
Results: Fig. 8 plots the CDF of the observed power ratios at
the receiver. The CDF is taken across both indoor/outdoor and
near/far locations to provide an overall characterization of ambient
backscatter that we delve into next. The ﬁgure shows the following:
• The median power ratio is about 1.4, which is in the range
targeted by traditional backscatter communication in RFID de-
vices [35] and is a favorable ratio. To get an intuition for why
this is the case, consider a hypothetical scenario where the trans-
mitter and a receiver see the same ambient TV signal strength and
the transmitter backscatters all its incident signals in the direction
of the receiver. In this case, even if the transmitter and receiver
are placed next to each other, the average received power with
backscatter is twice the received power without backscatter, i.e.,
the power ratio is 2. In practice, however, the ratio is often much
lower than this idealized value, as a transmitter reﬂects only a
fraction of its incident signal in the receiver’s direction; larger
distances further attenuates the signal strength.
• The power ratio can be as high as 4.3. This is due to the wireless
multipath property. Speciﬁcally, because of multipath, nodes that
are located at different locations see different signal strengths
from the TV tower. So when the transmitter is in locations where
it sees a much higher TV signal strength than the receiver, its
backscattered signal can be signiﬁcantly higher in amplitude than
the direct TV signal.
6.2 BER at the Ambient Receiver v/s Distance
Next, we evaluate our low-power receiver described in §3.3.
Experiments: We repeat the previous experiments, but with our pro-
totype ambient receiver receiving from the backscattering transmit-
ter. We measure the bit error-rate (BER) observed at the receiver
as a function of the distance between the transmitter and the re-
ceiver. For each distance value, we repeat the experiments at ten
different positions to account for multipath effects; the transmitter
sends a total of 104 bits at each position. The BER is computed by
comparing the transmitted bits with the bits output by the proto-
type’s demodulator circuit. Since the total number of bits transmit-
ted at each position is 104, we set the BER of experiments that see
no errors to 10−4 (the upper bound on the BER for these experi-
ments). Finally, since the BER depends on the transmitter’s bit rate,
we evaluate three different prototypes that are designed to work at
100 bps, 1 kbps, and 10 kbps. We note that, in total, we perform
1020 measurements across bit rates and locations.
Results: We plot the results in Fig. 9. The ﬁgures show that:
• As the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases,
the BER across bit rates and locations increases. Further, the
BER is better in outdoor locations than in indoor locations. This
