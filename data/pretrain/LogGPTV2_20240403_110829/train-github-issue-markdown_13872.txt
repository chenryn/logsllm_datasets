Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
Two identical sub-dependencies are being included twice in the build.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**  
`projectA` depends on `libA@^2.0.0`, `depA` and `depB`.  
`depA` and `depB` both depend on `libA@^1.0.0`
This results in a directory structure like this:
    projectA
    - node_modules
    -- libA
    -- depA
    ---- node_modules/libA
    -- depB
    ---- node_modules/libA 
When the project is built, included in the bundle are:
    libA@2.0.0
    depA
    depB
    libA@1.0.0
    libA@1.0.0
**What is the expected behavior?**  
The included modules should be:
    libA@2.0.0
    depA
    depB
    libA@1.0.0
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**  
`webpack@3.5.5`
I have run `npm dedupe` but it can't fix the problem. This is understandable,
because npm doesn't have anywhere to "put" this lower-version dependency that
is shared by both `depA` and `depB`. Previously I believe this was solved with
the `DedupePlugin` which has since been turned into a no-op.
