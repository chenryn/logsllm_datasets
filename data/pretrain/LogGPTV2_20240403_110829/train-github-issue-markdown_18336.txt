In my project I have:
      "devDependencies": {
        "babel-cli": "~6.1.2",
        "babel-preset-es2015": "~6.1.2",
        …
When I run babel-doctor I see this:
    ❯ babel-doctor
    Babel Doctor
    Running sanity checks on your system. This may take a few minutes...
    ✔ Found config at /Users/tema/Dropbox/Projects/_Repos/sweet2/.babelrc
    ✔ No duplicate babel packages found
    ✖ We found some outdated packages:
    - babel-runtime - Latest is 6.0.14. Local version is 5.8.29
    ✔ You're on npm >=3.3.0
    Found potential issues on your machine :(
But the latest version of babel-cli depends on babel-runtime ^5.0.0 so I can’t
fix this warning. It’s very confusing.
