In my project, I have the following `devDependencies`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "babel-cli": "~6.1.2",
  "babel-preset-es2015": "~6.1.2",
  ...
}
```

When I run `babel-doctor`, I receive the following output:

```plaintext
❯ babel-doctor
Babel Doctor
Running sanity checks on your system. This may take a few minutes...
✔ Found config at /Users/tema/Dropbox/Projects/_Repos/sweet2/.babelrc
✔ No duplicate Babel packages found
✖ We found some outdated packages:
  - babel-runtime: Latest is 6.0.14. Local version is 5.8.29
✔ You're on npm >=3.3.0
Found potential issues on your machine :(
```

However, the latest version of `babel-cli` depends on `babel-runtime` ^5.0.0, so I am unable to resolve this warning. This situation is quite confusing.
