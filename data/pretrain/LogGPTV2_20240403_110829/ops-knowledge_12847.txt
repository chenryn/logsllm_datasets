User: I have a problem. I am writing a piece of software, which is required to perform an operation which requires the user to be in sudo mode. running 'sudo python filename.py' isn't an option, which leads me to my question. Is there a way of changing to sudo half way through a python script, security isn't an issue as the user will know the sudo password the program should run in the following way to illustrate the issue

program running as normal user
...... performing operations
user enters sudo password
user changed to sudo
sub program requiring sudo permission is run
on trigger even (end of sub program) user becomes normal user again
...... performing operations

My problem lies in step 3, any pointers or frameworks you could suggest would be of great help.
Cheers
Chris
Assistant: You can use setuid to set the users uid. But for obvious security reasons you can only do this if you are root (or the program has suid root rights). Both of these are probably a bad idea.
In this case you need to sudo rights to run a specific program. In that case just sub to "sudo theprogram" instead.
