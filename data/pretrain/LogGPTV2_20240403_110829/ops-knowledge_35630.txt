User: I have a Scheduled Task on a WinXP SP2 machine that is set up to run a python script:
Daily
Start time: 12:03 AM
Schedule task daily: every 1 day
Start date: some time in the past
Repeat task: every 5 minutes
Until: Duration 24 hours
Basically, i want the script to run every five minutes, for ever.
My problem is the task runs sometime after 23:47 every night (presumably after 23:55) and does not run after that.  What am I doing wrong? Alternatively, is there a different method you can suggest other than using Windows scheduled tasks?
Assistant: Also, for the past year or so I've seen a common bug where Scheduled Tasks on Server 2003 or XP do not run if either of the following checkboxes are on:

"Don't start the task if the computer is running on batteries"
"Stop the task if battery mode begins"

It seems that Windows gets a little confused if you have a battery (on a laptop) or a UPS (on a server, for example), whether or not your utility power is working.
Also, as a rule I would trim down the time or uncheck the option to "Stop the task if it runs for X minutes" when you're running it so often.
