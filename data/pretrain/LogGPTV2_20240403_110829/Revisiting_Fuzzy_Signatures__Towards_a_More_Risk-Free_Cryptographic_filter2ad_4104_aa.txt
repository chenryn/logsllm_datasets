ABSTRACT
Biometric authentication is one of the promising alternatives to
standard password-based authentication offering better usability
and security. In this work, we revisit the biometric authentication
based on fuzzy signatures introduced by Takahashi et al. (ACNS’15,
IJIS’19). These are special types of digital signatures where the
secret signing key can be a “fuzzy” data such as user’s biometrics.
Compared to other cryptographically secure biometric authentica-
tions as those relying on fuzzy extractors, the fuzzy signature-based
scheme provides a more attractive security guarantee. However,
despite their potential values, fuzzy signatures have not attracted
much attention owing to their theory-oriented presentations in all
prior works. For instance, the discussion on the practical feasibility
of the assumptions (such as the entropy of user biometrics), which
the security of fuzzy signatures hinges on, is completely missing.
In this work, we revisit fuzzy signatures and show that we can in-
deed efficiently and securely implement them in practice. At a high
level, our contribution is threefold: (i) we provide a much simpler,
more efficient, and direct construction of fuzzy signature compared
to prior works; (ii) we establish novel statistical techniques to exper-
imentally evaluate the conditions on biometrics that are required
to securely instantiate fuzzy signatures; and (iii) we provide experi-
mental results using a real-world finger-vein dataset to show that
finger-veins from a single hand are sufficient to construct efficient
and secure fuzzy signatures. Our performance analysis shows that
in a practical scenario with 112-bits of security, the size of the sig-
nature is 1256 bytes, and the running time for signing/verification
is only a few milliseconds.

1 INTRODUCTION
Background. A user authentication system is a central infrastruc-
ture in a digital society. One of the most widely used methods
for authentication is those using passwords. However, today it is
becoming increasingly more difficult to protect passwords and to
securely manage password-based authentication from the emerging
advanced forms of cyberattacks. For example, the ENISA Threat
Landscape 2020 report [11] states that 64% of the publicly exposed
personal data due to security breaches in 2019 contained passwords.
One of the most promising alternatives to password-based au-
thentication that has been gradually gaining traction is biometric
authentication [35], where a user’s identity is verified through its
biometrics such as face, iris, fingerprint, and finger-vein. A familiar
example is those widely implemented on personal smartphones
such as the Touch ID on iPhone. These types of authentication
relies on the users holding a device embedding some information
on their biometrics. In contrast, recently, biometric authentication
without relying on these personal devices — (personal) device-free
biometric authentication — is beginning to be deployed in commer-
cial and governmental services. Here, anybody can authenticate
using the same publicly available device. This includes for instance
the facial recognition payment service Alipay managed by Alibaba
in China [19], and the world’s largest biometric ID system Aadhaar
used in India [27]. Due to their convenience and digital inclusive-
ness [26], the demand for such device-freeness is expected to grow
further in the future in other applications ranging from payment
and ATM transactions to medical systems, immigration control,
and for building a national digital identity infrastructure. The focus
of this article is on such device-free biometric authentication.

to securely protect biometric information. As Visa [35] stated, the
“Top concerns of using biometric authentication for payments” is
“The risk of a security leak of sensitive information, e.g., you can’t
change your fingerprint if it is compromised.” To realize a device-
free biometric authentication, biometric information is typically
stored and maintained on a central server. However, this opens up
the risk of exposing user biometric information due to a security
breach on the server. Although standard practices such as encrypt-
ing the database and placing appropriate access control on the users
can mitigate the risk, as history shows, these common procedures
are not easy to enforce or to execute in real-life due to human errors
or lack of a security background. For instance, a vulnerability in
the Aadhaar system was recently exploited and anybody had unre-
stricted access to the biometric information of more than 1 billion
Indian citizens [10]. Since leaking biometric information is has an
irreversible damage compared to leaking passwords, minimizing
the risk on the server is one of the central problems for biometric
authentication.
Biometric template protection (BTP) is designed to protect such
biometric information stored on a server and has been standardized
in recent years (ISO/IEC 24745 [16], 30136 [17]). Fuzzy extractor
(FE) [8] [16] is one of the most promising tools for constructing a
biometric authentication system with BTP whose (cryptographic)
security can be formally analyzed. Informally, an FE enables to
extract a fixed secret key from a fuzzy biometric. Here, biometrics
are inherently fuzzy objects since they can slightly change over
time, and measuring them perfectly is impossible due to measure-
ment errors. The extracted fixed secret key is then used as a secret
key of an ordinary signature scheme to achieve a “biometric-based”
signature scheme, which can, in turn, be used for a biometric au-
thentication system with BTP. More accurately, a user also needs a
user-specific helper data1 to reconstruct the fixed secret key from
its biometric. Intuitively, a helper data encodes some information
on user biometrics to help reconstruct the same fixed secret key
from the fuzzy biometric. Since the helper data does not directly
reveal the secret key nor the user biometric, it is considered more
secure to store the helper data rather than the user biometric on
the server.
A typical flow of an FE-based device-free biometric authentica-
tion system is given in Fig. 1 (left). Each service provider (e.g., bank,
supermarket, hospital) has a client device. A user can use any of
these devices to authenticate itself to the server by scanning its
biometrics. A user first accesses the client device and makes an ID
claim to the server. The client device downloads the corresponding
helper data from the server, and the user then uses its biometric to
reconstruct the fixed secret key (denoted as KeyExtract in Fig. 1)
used by the underlying ordinary signature scheme. Since the server
only needs to store the user’s helper data, the FE-based system
provides BTP and successfully decreases the level of confidential
information stored on the server. However, due to the added inter-
action between the client device and server, this opens up another
type of risk. Notice that once an attacker obtains a client device,
it can freely make ID claims to the server to collect the helper
data of any user. Therefore, considering the attacker only needs to

steal/compromise one of the many client devices, the possibility of
a database exposure is much higher compared to the naive system
without BTP; the system where the biometrics are all stored on the
server and the only way to retrieve them is through breaching the
server. Of course, the concrete amount of biometric information
leaked from the helper data in an FE depends on the specific con-
struction and the security parameter used therein. However, in any
case, we cannot take the risk zero since the adversary can collect
many helper data easily and target to break any one of them; this
is similar to the issue raised by reverse brute-force attacks. Thus,
although the FE-based system lowers the level of confidential infor-
mation stored on the server, it does so by increasing the possibility
of such confidential information being exposed. Since the security
risk of a system (R) is given by the product of the possibility of the
data on the server being exposed (P) and the impact of such data
being exposed (I), this brings us to our central question:
Can we lower the level of confidential information stored on the
server (as in the FE-based system) while simultaneously lowering the
possibility of such information being leaked (as in the naive system)?
Fuzzy signature. The main primitive we focus on in this paper —
fuzzy signatures — can potentially be used to solve this question.
Fuzzy signatures, originally introduced in [32], are a special type
of signature schemes that allow users to directly use their fuzzy
biometrics as the signing key without requiring any additional
information. The description of a fuzzy signature is provided in
Fig. 2. Note that a verification key vkFS of a fuzzy signature is
implicitly associated to the user biometric and informally holds a
similar purpose as a helper data for FE.
Using a fuzzy signature, we can construct a device-free biometric
authentication system as in Fig. 2 (right). From a user experience
perspective, it is identical to the naive and FE-based systems: a user
can show up empty-handed and authenticate itself by scanning
its biometrics. In contrast, from a security point of view, the fuzzy
signature-based system takes the best of the two systems: it provides
BTP since the server no longer needs to store the user biometrics,
and an adversary cannot collect user-specific information (e.g.,
helper data) since the client device and the server communicate
non-interactively. Tab. 1 gives a qualitative comparison of the risk
(R) = (P) × (I) of the three systems: the naive, FE-based, and fuzzy
signature-based systems. It can be checked that the fuzzy signature-
based biometric authentication system achieves the lowest security
risk among the three systems.

1.1 Our Contribution
In this work, we show that fuzzy signatures can indeed be effi-
ciently and securely implemented in practice, and advocate the
benefit of further practice-oriented research on fuzzy signatures.
Our contribution is threefold: (i) we provide a much simpler, more
efficient, and direct construction of fuzzy signature compared to
[33]. Very roughly, depending on the amount of min-entropy we can
extract from the fuzzy biometric, our construction can be proven
secure based on the standard discrete logarithm (DL) assumption or
proven unconditionally secure in the generic group model [31]; (ii)
we establish novel statistical techniques to experimentally evaluate
the conditions on biometrics that are required to securely instan-
tiate fuzzy signatures; and (iii) we provide experimental results
using real-world finger-vein dataset to show that finger-veins from
a single hand can be used to construct efficient and secure fuzzy
signatures. The statistical method provided in this work is quite gen-
eral so we believe this to be an independent interest for other works
such as evaluating the biometric entropy to securely instantiate
fuzzy extractors. Below, we expand on each of our contributions.
(i) Simple and efficient construction of fuzzy signature. We provide
a simple and efficient fuzzy signature scheme by tweaking the
classical Schnorr signature scheme [29]. Similarly to prior works,
we rely on a tool called linear sketch to bridge fuzzy biometrics
and cryptographic primitives (e.g., signing keys). In our work, we
simplify the definition of linear sketch and provide a conceptually
cleaner construction of linear sketch based on a fundamental math-
ematical object called lattices. At a high level, the specific type of
lattice being used dictates how unwastefully we use the entropy
provided by the fuzzy biometrics and how well we approximate
the distance metric of the fuzzy biometrics by the distance met-
ric induced by the underlying cryptographic primitive. With this
abstraction, we show that a so-called triangular lattice allows to
best approximate the Euclidean distance and observe that previ-
ous works [33] implicitly used a suboptimal lattice. The security
assumption that underlies the security of our fuzzy signature is a
simple-to-state variant of the standard DL assumption considered

are quite limited and only produced by a small group [18, 21, 33]2.
The main reason for the unfortunate disparity between its poten-
tial value and amount of related work seems to stem from the fact
that fuzzy signatures are mainly presented in a very cryptographi-
