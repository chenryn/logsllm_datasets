Question: "Which of the following is the best counterargument to the belief that finding multiple short paths in a web of trust inherently increases the reliability of the resulting public key?"
 "A": "Multiple paths may lead to information overload, making it more difficult for users to discern which paths are trustworthy."
 "B": "The existence of multiple paths doesn't necessarily mitigate the risk of intermediaries being sloppy or malicious in their certificate signings."
 "C": "Users might prefer a single, long and complex path as it could potentially involve more individuals who have verified each other's identity."
 "D": "A greater number of paths could increase the computational cost and time required for public key verification, which could be seen as a disadvantage."
Answer: B
