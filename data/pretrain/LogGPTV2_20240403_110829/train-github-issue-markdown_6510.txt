I'd like to be able to have multiple instances of a model in a scene, each
using different materials.
If I have a mesh with only one material, I can just create multiple THREE.Mesh
objects that all use the same mesh geometry and then apply different materials
to each THREE.Mesh. No problem.
However, if I have geometry that has multiple materials, I need to use the
MeshFaceMaterial for the THREE.Mesh and assign an array of materials to the
geometry object. So, my question is, is there any way to have multiple
instances of that geometry that also have different materials without
duplicating the geometry data?
If this functionality doesn't exist, I'd be interested in adding it to
Three.JS.
Up until now, I've actually been splitting this type of geometry into pieces
(one for each material) and then creating a separate THREE.Mesh for each but
I'm not sure this is the best way (and it seems like it might cause a fair bit
more overhead since there are potentially many more transformations being
processed for a single model).
