 **Migrated issue, originally created by Anonymous**
It is possible for a MSSQL connection attached to one database to reference
objects in another database by using the objects' full names in the form,
... The schema.Table constructor takes
a schema argument and an owner argument already. These arguments should be
used so that the schema argument takes the place of the database name in the
format described above.
So the following table definition:
t = Table('a_table', meta, Column('col1', Integer), Column('col2', Integer),
schema='database_name', owner='owner_name')
and select construction:
select(t)
would yield the following SQL when compiled:
SELECT a_table_xxxx.col1, a_table_xxxx.col2  
FROM database_name.owner_name.a_table  
AS a_table_xxxx
Please find included a simple test case that demonstrates the desired
behavior.
