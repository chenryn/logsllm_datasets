Clearly, if xi  0, a valid ε/2-differentially private

negative 2-Lipschitz continuous lower bound, δ, on ∆GS − ∆G,
where ∆GS
and ∆G respectively correspond to the k-sensitive neigh-
borhood graph for the anomaly definition corresponding to д, and
the neighborhood graph. Let Uδ be the mechanism that Construc-
tion 2 yields. Next, fix arbitrary databases x and y that are neighbors
in GS .
When δ (i, x ) = δ (i, y) = 0, P (Uδ (z) = b) = P (M (z) = b) for
every database z and b in {0, 1}. The privacy constraints in this case,
are trivially satisfied.
Next, consider the case, where δ (i, x ) > δ (i, y) ≥ 0 — this is
without loss of generality as x and y are picked arbitrarily. Since M
is valid ε/2-differentially private, we get the following for д(i, x ) = b
for some b ∈ {0, 1},
1 − P (M (x ) (cid:44) b) e
−ε /2 ≤eε (1 − P (M (y) (cid:44) b))

Recall that GS is a subgraph of G and contains a subset of edges
of G, and ∆G (i, z) ≥ 1 for every database z. Hence, it follows that
∆GS (i, z) ≥ ∆G (i, z) ≥ 1, and ∆GS (i, x ) = 1 implies ∆G (i, x ) = 1.
Thus, from the above it follows that when ∆GS (i, x ) − ∆G (i, x ) ≥

and ∆GS (i, x ) ≥ 2, we have д(i, x ) = д(i, y). So, let b = д(i, x ). From
(9), we get the following.
1 − P (M (x ) (cid:44) b) e
−ε /2 ≤ eε (1 − P (M (y) (cid:44) b))

(cid:32)
since δ is 2-Lipschitz continuous, we get
1 − eε ≤ P (M (x ) (cid:44) b)

In a similar fashion, by swapping x and y in (9), one can show
that the privacy constraint P (Uδ (y) = b) ≤ eε P (Uδ (x ) = b) also
holds. Below we show that the other constraints are also satisfied.

The above inequality holds because M is ε/2-DP and δ is 2-Lipschitz
continuous.
Since all the privacy constraints hold for arbitrarily picked neigh-
bors and δ (which satisfies the conditions specified in the claim), and
a valid ε/2-differentially private M for an anomaly identification
query, the claim holds in general.
As for the claim of accuracy, it is a direct implication from the

Construction 2. This completes the proof.
A.9 Composition
Here, we assume that every mechanism has its independent source
of randomness and has the domain D. Further, E(G) for a graph G
denotes the set of edges in G. We make the following very simple
observation.
Observation 1. For any simple graphs G and G′ over D, two
databases are neighbors in the graph H = (D, E(G) ∩ E(G′)) if and
only if they are neighbors in G and G′.
Claim 3. If mechanisms M1 and M2 are respectively ε1-SP for
GS1 and ε2-SP for GS2, then M (x ) := (M1(x ), M2 (x )) for every x is
(ε1 + ε2)-SP for GS = (D, E(GS1 ) ∩ E(GS2 )).
Proof sketch. The claim follows from M1 and M2 being SP
for ε1 and ε2, and Observation 1, which ensures that the privacy
constraints will be met for neighbors in GS .
□
We say, for Y ⊆ X, a mechanism M is Y-dependent if and only
if for every r ∈ Ranдe (M ) and x and y such that xi = yi for every
i ∈ Y, P (M (x ) = r ) = P (M (y) = r ).
Claim 4. For any partition of X = Y1 ⊔ Y2, if mechanisms M1 and
M2 are respectively Y1-dependent ε1-SP for GS1 and Y2-dependent ε2-
SP for GS2, then M (x ) := (M1 (x ), M2(x )) for every x is max(ε1, ε2)-
SP for GS = (D, E(GS1 ) ∩ E(GS2 )).
Proof sketch. Firstly, note that M1 and M2 being SP for ε1 and
ε2 along with Observation 1, ensure that the privacy constraints
will be met for neighbors in GS for some value of ε. Further, since
every neighbor in GS differ by one record and mechanisms M1 and
M2 are respectively Y1 and Y2 dependent (for an arbitrarily fixed
partition), every privacy constraint will hold for either ε1 or ε2.
From here the claim follows.

A.9.1 Proof of Claim 5 .
Lemma A.2. Fix arbitrary values for k ≥ 1, β ≥ 1 and r ≥ 0. For
(β, r )-anomaly, for every record i ∈ X and every database x ∈ D,
i is k-sensitive with respect to x ⇐⇒ Bx (i, r ) ≥ β + 1 − k.
Proof. Arbitrarily fix k, β ≥ 1, r ≥ 0, i ∈ X, and x ∈ D. Further,
fix p to be the normality property corresponding to (β, r )-anomaly.
Firstly, we prove the “if” direction through its contrapositive. So
assume Bx (i, r )  0, kt , βt ≥ 1, and a mechanism, Mt : D → {0, 1},
that is εt -SP for kt -sensitive neighborhood graph corresponding to
(βt , rt )-anomaly and is also Y (it , rt )-dependent. Further, let m be
the maximum number of it ’s that are within any ball of radius
max(r1, . . . , rn ), ε = max(ε1, . . . , εn ), k = min(k1, . . . , kn ), β =
max(β1, . . . , βn ), and r = min(r1, . . . , rn ).
If M (x ) := (M1 (x ), . . . , Mn (x )) for every x, then M is mε-sensitively
private for k-sensitive neighborhood graph corresponding to (β, r )-
anomaly.
Proof. Arbitrarily fix the values for all the symbols used in the
claim above as per the specification.
Firstly, we consider the guarantee with respect to the sensi-
tive neighborhood graph. Here it is sufficient to show that the k-
sensitive neighborhood graph, GS , corresponding to (β, r )-anomaly,
is a subgraph of the kt -sensitive neighborhood graph, Gt
, corre-
S
sponding to (βt , rt )-anomaly for every t. Thus we show that, for
any t and two databases x and y, if x and y are neighbors in GS ,
then they are neighbors in Gt
. So arbitrarily fix x and y that are
neighbors in GS and t ∈ [n]. Since x and y are neighbors in GS ,
S
there exists a record i that k-sensitive with respect to x or y. Let i be
k-sensitive with respect to x—this is without loss of generality since
x and y are picked arbitrarily. Now, from Lemma A.2, we get that
Bx (i, r ) ≥ β −k + 1. Since β ≥ βt and k ≤ kt , Bx (i, r ) ≥ βt −kt + 1;
this implies that i is kt -sensitive with respect to x (Lemma A.2),
and thus, x and y are neighbors in Gt
. Hence, we conclude that GS
S
is a subgraph of every Gt

.

show that the loss in privacy is at max mε. For any i ∈ X, let Ai
be such that for every t ∈ [n], t ∈ Ai ⇐⇒ d (i, it ) ≤ r′, where
r′ = max(r1, . . . , rn ). And let m = maxi∈X |Ai|. Arbitrarily fix, the
neighboring databases x and y in GS and w ∈ {0, 1}n. Let i be the
record in which x and y differ. Now it follows that
P(Ml (x ) = wl )
P(M (x ) = w )
P(M (y) = w )
P(Ml (y) = wl )

Above, the first equality holds because each of the Mt has its inde-
pendent source of randomness. The second equality holds because
each Mt is Y (it , rt )-dependent in addition to its randomness and
rt ≤ r′. The first inequality follows from Mt being εt -SP for GS ,
. The last inequality follows from the fact
which is a subgraph of Gt
that ε ≥ εt and m ≥ |Ai|.
S
Lastly, note that for any W ⊆ {0, 1}n, it follows that
P(M (x ) ∈ W )
P(M (y) ∈ W )

w ∈W P(M (x ) = w )
w ∈W P(M (y) = w )

A.10 Relation of SP to other definitions
A.10.1 One-sided differential privacy (OSDP) [13]. It allows for
mechanisms to be private that can reveal the presence or absence of
a sensitive record in the database. We explain this below. Consider
two neighboring databases x and y (i.e., they differ by one record)
such that x has exactly one sensitive record and y has no sensitive
record, and an ε-OSDP mechanism M : D → {0, 1} with P (M (x ) =
0) = 0 and P (M (y) = 0) = 1 – note this is possible as M only needs
to satisfy P (M (x ) ∈ b) ≤ eε P (M (y) ∈ b) for b ∈ {0, 1}. Now, if we
pick x or y randomly and reveal the output of M, the output will
reveal which database was used, and hence if the sensitive record
was present or not.
A.10.2 Tailored differential privacy (TDP) [36]. SP is a special case
of TDP. Which becomes clearer once we restate TDP for the un-
bounded case, which we deal with. For α : X × D → R≥0, a
mechanism is α (·)-TDP if for every two databases, x and y dif-
fering in a record i, and every R ⊆ Ranдe (M ), P (M (x ) ∈ R) ≤
eα (i,x )P (M (y) ∈ R). Let for every i and x, α (i, x ) = εdGS (x, x′)
(x′
= 1). Now, it is immediate that
j
a mechanism is α (·)-TDP if and only if it is ε-SP for GS . A simi-
lar statement holds true for Blowfish privacy [25], which follows
by considering the sensitive neighborhood graph to be the policy
graph.
