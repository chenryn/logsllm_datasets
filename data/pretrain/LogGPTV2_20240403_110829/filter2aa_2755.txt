### Overview of the Talk
- **Topic:** TURBO TRAC
- **Format:** Brevity is key due to time constraints.
- **Content:** 
  - Presentation of an idea and the thought process behind it.
  - Q&A session at the end.

### Background Information
- **Session ID (SID) Attack:**
  - **Session Hijacking:** Unauthorized access to a user's session.
  - **Session Fixation:** Forcing a known SID on a user.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
  - **Cross-Site Cooking:** Manipulating cookies on a victim's browser.
  - **Countermeasures:**
    - Use of long, random session keys.
    - Regular regeneration of SIDs.
    - Encrypted transmissions.
    - Secondary checks.
    - IP address limitations.
    - Frequent SID changes.

### What is 'Session Donation'?
- **Definition:** Donating your SID to another user.
- **Similarity to Session Fixation:**
  - The attacker "fixes" the victim's session to a specific ID.
  - Many Session Fixation countermeasures (e.g., server-generated IDs, SID regeneration) are ineffective against this attack.
- **Ease of Execution:** It is easier to give someone your identity than to steal theirs.

---

### Example Scenario
- **Step-by-Step:**
  1. Joe logs into a service and deletes the stored information.
  2. Joe donates his session to Jim.
  3. Joe tells Jim there were earlier issues and he needs to re-enter his information.
  4. Jim inputs his information and saves it.
  5. Joe can now log in as himself and access Jim's information.

### Issues with Session Donation
- **User Behavior:**
  - Users do not need to log in for the attack to succeed.
  - User training often focuses on being cautious during authentication, but not on giving away their SIDs.
- **Single Login Setups:**
  - Common in corporations and universities.
- **Attack Continuity:**
  - The connection does not need to be interrupted.
  - SSL certificates remain valid.

---

### Requirements for the Attack
- **Obtaining a SID:**
  - The attacker must be able to obtain a SID.
  - If the attacker can log in or use the service, they can obtain a SID.
- **SID Distribution:**
  - Methods include Cross-Site Cooking, Session Fixation, and Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
  - These methods make it easier to fix a value than to steal one.

---

### Why This is Dangerous
- **Ineffectiveness of Countermeasures:**
  - Many Session Hijacking countermeasures do not work effectively.
  - The victim is given a valid SID, bypassing many defenses.
- **Identity Management:**
  - Can you prevent someone from giving away their identity?
  - Can you prevent someone from authenticating as themselves after giving away their identity?

---

### Paradoxical Safety
- **Session Hijacking Prevention:**
  - May actually make session donation "safer" for the attacker.
  - The attacker can invalidate the donated session post-attack, preventing the victim from removing stolen information.

---

### Prevention
- **Challenges:**
  - Hard but not impossible to prevent.
  - The attack targets the existence and usage of SIDs, not the SIDs themselves.
- **Strategies:**
  - Prevent XSS, which accounts for a large percentage of web vulnerabilities.
  - Use different SID generation methods.
  - Implement IP address checks during SID generation and authentication.
  - Use a hash of the IP address as part of SID generation.
  - Authentication involves regenerating the SID and comparing it.
