### Expected Behavior
1. Clone the `electron-quick-start` example.
2. Modify the `index.html` file with the following content:

   <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   <p>Hello World!</p>
   <p>We are using Node.js, Chromium, and Electron.</p>
   <button id="open-pdf">Open PDF Window</button>
   ```
3. Add the following JavaScript to handle the button click and open a new window:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('open-pdf').addEventListener('click', () => {
     const pdfWindow = new BrowserWindow({
       webPreferences: {
         nodeIntegration: true,
         contextIsolation: false,
       },
     });
     pdfWindow.loadURL('data:text/html;charset=utf-8,' + encodeURIComponent(`
       <h1>Hello World!</h1>
       <p>Hello World!</p>
       <p>We are using Node.js, Chromium, and Electron.</p>
       <script>
         window.print();
       </script>
     `));
   });
   ```
4. Run the application and click the "Open PDF Window" button.
5. The print dialog should open, and after clicking "OK," the content should be printed, and the `pdf_window` should remain responsive and scrollable.

### Actual Behavior
The `pdf_window` becomes unresponsive and does not react to any interaction after the print dialog is closed.
