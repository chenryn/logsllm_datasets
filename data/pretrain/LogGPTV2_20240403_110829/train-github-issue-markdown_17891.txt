## Expected Behavior
    The radio button and checkbox should not blink by default. Once selected then they should have there selected animation. Right now as soon as I render the Checkbox & Radio button this is what happens. Kindly have a look at this image

## Current Behavior
As you can see in the image above the checkbox and radio button keep on
blinking
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
My codebase is as follows
    // Material UI Components
    import Radio, { RadioGroup } from 'material-ui/Radio';
    import Checkbox from 'material-ui/Checkbox';
    import { FormLabel, FormControl, FormControlLabel } from 'material-ui/Form';
    .
    .
    .
            {/* {name} */}
              {listOfValues.map((item, index) => (
                } label={item} />
              ))}
            {/*{name ? name : 'Checklist'}*/}
            {listOfValues.map((item, i) => (
              }
                onChange={(event, isInputChecked) => { this.onHandle(isInputChecked, item) }}
                checked={selectedValues.includes(item)}
                label={item}
              />
            ))}
