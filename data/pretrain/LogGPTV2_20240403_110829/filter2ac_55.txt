**ATT&CK ID:** T1547.012  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Print Processors

Adversaries may exploit print processors to execute malicious DLLs during system boot, thereby achieving persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLL files that the print spooler service (spoolsv.exe) loads at startup. By replacing or injecting malicious code into these legitimate print processor DLLs, attackers can ensure that their code runs with elevated privileges each time the system boots, thus maintaining a foothold in the compromised environment.
