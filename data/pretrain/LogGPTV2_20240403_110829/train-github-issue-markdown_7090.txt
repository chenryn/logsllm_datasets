**Code**
    interface Factory {
        (): T;
        mixin(mixin: U): T & U;
    }
    function compose(base: T): Factory {
        return;
    }
    const factory = compose({
        foo() {
            return this;
        },
        bar() {
            this.foo(); //  {
                return this; //  {
                return this; // <-- correct object literal type
            };
        }
    };
**Expected behavior:**
That both references to `this` are typed the same.
**Actual behavior:**
I am pretty sure this is related to #8356.
Outside of the lambda function in the first object literal, `this` is an
intersection type of the object literal and the contextual type (which happen
to be the same). In the second example, `this` is properly the object literal
type including within the scope of the lambda function.
