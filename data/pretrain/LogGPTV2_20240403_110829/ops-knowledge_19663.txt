User: How to use Python code to monitor CPU utilization and notify the administrator in time?
Assistant: To use Python code to monitor CPU utilization and notify the administrator in time, you need to follow the steps below: 1. Use the psutil library in the Python standard library to get the CPU utilization of the system, install the psutil library: `pip install psutil` 2. Set Threshold for CPU utilization, e.g. alert when CPU utilization exceeds 90%. 3. Use Python's SMTP library to send emails to notify administrators, install smtplib library: `pip install smtplib` 4. Write Python code to continuously monitor CPU utilization, and use SMTP library to send emails to notify administrators. The specific code is roughly as follows: ```python import psutil import smtplib import time # Set the threshold of CPU utilization CPU_THRESHOLD = 90.0 # Related configuration for sending emails (using mailbox 163 as an example) SMTP_SERVER = 'smtp.163.com' SMTP_PORT = 25 EMAIL_USERNAME = 'your_email@163.com' EMAIL_PASSWORD = 'your_email_password' EMAIL_RECEIVER = 'admin_email@xxx.com' while True: cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent() # Alert if CPU utilization exceeds threshold if cpu_percent > CPU_THRESHOLD: try: # Send email to notify administrator server = smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_PORT) server.ehlo() server.login(EMAIL_USERNAME, EMAIL_PASSWORD) message = 'Subject: High CPU Usage\n\nThe CPU usage is currently '+ str(cpu_percent ) + '%' server.sendmail(EMAIL_USERNAME, EMAIL_RECEIVER, message) print("Email notification sent successfully") except Exception as e: print("Error: ", str(e)) # Check CPU utilization again every once in a while Rate time.sleep(60) ``` Note: You need to replace `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_RECEIVER` email addresses and their passwords in the code with your own.
