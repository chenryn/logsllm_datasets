User: How can I detect when a flash drive is plugged in? I'm using a bare Debian installation, without any GUI and want to be notified in my Python script when a new flash drive appears... I know that D-BUS distributes such information, but i dont want to use D-BUS. Is there a more bare access to that information? Shouldn't that be available under /proc or /sys? How can I "connect" to that source?

Assistant: I did this using zenity in a script and udev with rule on rhel6 with:
KERNEL=="sd[b-d]", DRIVERS=="usb", ACTION=="add", RUN+="/path/to/script"
