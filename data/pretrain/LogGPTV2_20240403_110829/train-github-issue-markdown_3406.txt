Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am using the following code to load a GIF into an `ImageView`:
```java
Glide.with(MainActivity.this).load(url).asGif().into(imageView);
```
However, after 5 seconds, the `ImageView` does not display the GIF. When I add the `diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.SOURCE)` option, the GIF loads successfully.

This version is clearer and more coherent, making it easier for others to understand the issue you are describing.
