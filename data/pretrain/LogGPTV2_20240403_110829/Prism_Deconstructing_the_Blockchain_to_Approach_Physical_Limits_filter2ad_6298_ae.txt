Next, we show that we can confirm proposer sets up to level
ℓ with an expected latency independent of ε, and the final leader
sequence is contained in the outer product of the confirmed sets.

Suppose the first proposer block at level ℓ appears at round Rℓ. Then

Let us express the latency bound (16) in terms of physical param-
eters. If we set the voting rate ¯fv equal to the largest possible given
the security constraint (10): ¯fv = 1

With this choice of parameters, and in the regime where the bandwidth-
delay product CD/Bv is large so that the second term in (16) can be
neglected, the expected latency for list confirmation is bounded by
c1(β)D seconds, i.e. proportional to the propagation delay. Here,

and is positive for β < 0.5. The confirmation error probability is ex-
ponentially small in CD/Bv. This is the constant part of the latency
versus security parameter tradeoff of Prism in Fig. 1. Since CD/Bv
is very large in typical networks, a confirmation error probability
exponentially small in CD/Bv is already very small. To achieve an
even smaller error probability ε we can reduce the voting rate ¯fv
smaller below the security constraint (10) and increase the number
of voter chains. More specifically, we set
¯fv =

to the network capacity C/Bv.
Figure 9: Public proposer block p1 has the largest lower con-
fidence bound, which is larger than the upper confidence
bound of the private block. So list confirmation is possible
and the set confirmed is Πℓ(r) = {p1, p2, p3}.
4.5 Fast confirmation latency
4.5.1 List confirmation latency
We convert the intuition from Section 4.1 to a formal rule for fast
confirming a set of proposer blocks, which enables confirming a
list of proposer sequences. The idea is to have confidence intervals
around the number of votes cast on each proposer block. Figure
9 gives an example where there are 5 proposal blocks in public
at a given level, and we are currently at round r. The confidence
interval [V
