### ATT&CK ID: M1028
### ATT&CK Technique Name: Operating System Configuration

To prevent the enumeration of administrator accounts during User Account Control (UAC) elevation, which can lead to the disclosure of account names, you can modify a specific Registry key. The relevant key is located at:

```
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\CredUI\EnumerateAdministrators
```

This setting can be disabled through Group Policy. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Group Policy Editor.
2. Navigate to:
   - **Computer Configuration** > **[Policies]** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Credential User Interface**.
3. Locate and configure the policy:
   - **Enumerate administrator accounts on elevation**.

By disabling this setting, you can enhance the security of your system by preventing the potential exposure of administrator account names during UAC elevation.
