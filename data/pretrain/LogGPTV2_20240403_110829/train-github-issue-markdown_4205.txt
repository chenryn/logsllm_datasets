Subject: Syntax Highlighting Issue in Atom with Ruby Code

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I recently encountered a syntax highlighting issue while writing Ruby code in Atom. The problem specifically occurs after using the `%{}` syntax.

For example, when I write the following line of code:
```ruby
object.something(%{(default: $FIlE, or "/asd")})
```
everything after the `%{}` is highlighted in green, which seems to be incorrect.

Here are the details of my setup:
- Atom Version: 0.103.0
- Operating System: Mac OS X 10.9.3

Could you please look into this and let me know if there is a known fix or if there are any workarounds?

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
