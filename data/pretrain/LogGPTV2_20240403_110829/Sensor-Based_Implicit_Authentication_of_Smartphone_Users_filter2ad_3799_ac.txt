system, there are many design parameters that have yet to be
chosen. Our goal is to get the highest authentication accuracy
using the most commonly available sensors and computatio-
nally simple algorithms, to facilitate rapid deployment. What
sensors should we use? What features of the raw sensor
data streams are best? Can sensors from different devices
help improve accuracy? Can contexts improve authentication
accuracy, and if so, what are the simplest contexts that give the
best accuracy? Which machine learning algorithms are best?
Below, we systematically evaluate alternatives for each of these
design choices.
A. Experimental settings
We perform different types of experiments with 35 partici-
pants, using Nexus 5 smartphones and Moto 360 smartwatches.
We recorded the demographics (gender, and age range) of

the participants and show them in Figure 2. We collected
sensor data from different sensors in the smartphone and the
smartwatch, with a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The different types
of experiments (free-form usage, lab experiments and attacker
usage) will be discussed in detail in the sub-sections they are
used, as we attempt to answer the above questions on the
design parameters of our implicit authentication system. All
experimental results in the following sub-sections are based on
the free-form use of the smartphone and smartwatch for two
weeks, except the experiments for context detection (where
lab conditions are used) and the masquerading attacks (where
attacker usage is imitated). Free-form usage means the users
can use the devices with no restrictions, as they normally
would in their daily lives.
In our collected data for the machine learning algorithms,
we used 10-fold cross-validation to generate the training data
and testing data sets for evaluating the authentication perfor-
mance, i.e., 9/10 data would be used as the training data and
the remaining 1/10 is used as the testing data. To extensively
investigate the performance of our system, we repeated such
cross-validating mechanisms for 1000 iterations and averaged
the experimental results.
We also discuss the complexity of our system and the
impact on the battery drainage (Section V-H). Finally, we
discuss re-training authentication models (Section V-I) due to
usersâ€™ behavioral drift.
B. Which sensors to use?
Mobile sensing technology has matured to a state where
collecting many measurements through sensors in smartphones
is now becoming quite easy through, for example, Android
