### Election Disruption and Recovery Strategies

#### 1. Adversarial Behavior Based on Polling Trends
The adversary's actions are contingent on the current polling trends. If the preferred candidate is leading, the adversary may choose to do nothing. However, if the preferred candidate is not winning, the adversary might attempt to disrupt or sabotage the election. This disruption could force a re-election, providing the preferred candidate with another opportunity to win. Alternatively, it could cast doubt on the legitimacy of the winner’s mandate and erode voter confidence in the electoral process.

#### 2. Methods of Selective Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks
Selective DoS attacks can be executed in several ways:

- **Control Channel to Malicious DREs**: An outsider with access to a control channel for malicious Direct Recording Electronic (DRE) voting machines can monitor the polls and send a DoS command to these DREs.
- **Autonomous DREs**: A DRE machine can autonomously monitor the voting pattern throughout the day. If the pattern favors an undesired candidate, the DRE can fail, deleting all votes cast so far at that machine. This would specifically disrupt votes in precincts leaning against the attacker’s preferred candidate.
- **Malicious Trustees’ Software**: If the software used by trustees is compromised, it can collude to determine the election outcome. If the result is undesirable, the software can cause a DoS attack. Note that if all trustees use the same tallying software, only one corrupted programmer is needed to execute this attack.

Selective DoS attacks are particularly concerning because they directly threaten the integrity of the election and provide a strong motive for attackers to carry them out.

#### 3. Mitigation Strategies and Election Recovery
It is important to note that non-malicious hardware or software failures can also cause similar issues, making it difficult to distinguish between intentional attacks and unintentional failures. The following recovery mechanisms are evaluated for these DoS attacks:

- **Revoting**: One strategy is to allow affected voters to revote. Depending on the scope of the attack, this could range from allowing specific voters to revote to completely restarting the election. However, revoting has its challenges:
  - **Cost**: Redoing the entire election is the most expensive countermeasure.
  - **Partial Revoting**: Allowing only those voters who detected cheating to revote is insufficient, as less observant voters may not come forward, and it may be difficult to identify and remove illegitimate ballots added by a malicious DRE. Additionally, selective DoS attacks are not mitigated by this approach.

- **Voter-Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT)**: A VVPAT system generates a paper record verified by the voter before their electronic ballot is cast. This paper record is then placed in a ballot box and serves as an official record for recounts and audits.
  - **Recovery Mechanism**: Equipping cryptographic voting systems with VVPAT provides a viable mechanism for recovering from DoS attacks. It allows for independent verification of votes at different granularities.
  - **Benefits**:
    - **Granular Recovery**: If the entire electronic record is questionable, the VVPAT can be counted. If only a single precinct’s electronic record is suspect, that precinct’s VVPAT can be counted along with the other precincts’ electronic records.
    - **Auditability**: VVPAT provides an independent way to audit the cryptographic functions, ensuring that even voters who do not understand the underlying mathematics can be confident that their vote will be counted correctly.

#### 4. Implementing Secure Cryptographic Voting Protocols
A secure implementation of Neff and Chaum’s protocol requires addressing several underspecified areas and open research problems:

- **Bulletin Board**: Both protocols rely on a public bulletin board for anonymous, read-only access to data. The data must be stored robustly, and only authenticated parties should be able to append messages. Ensuring consistent delivery of the bulletin board contents to all readers is crucial. Without a detailed specification, the security of the system cannot be fully evaluated.
- **BSN Assignment**: The assignment of Ballot Serial Numbers (BSNs) is not specified. BSNs could be assigned externally or by DREs. Proper BSN assignment, combined with auditing and sign-in procedures, can help limit the scope of DoS attacks.
- **User Interfaces**: Malicious DREs can present different user interfaces to voters, potentially neglecting valid candidates. User interface design must make it clear to voters when something is amiss.
- **Tallying Software**: The tallying software is treated as a black box, but it must be implemented correctly. Using tallying software from a single source could lead to collusion. N-version programming can mitigate this threat but is expensive and requires detailed interface specifications.

#### 5. Open Research Problems
- **Subliminal Channels**: Developing cryptographic protocols that address subliminal channels is essential to resist privacy and coercion attacks. Techniques to eliminate subliminal channels in encrypted ballots need further research.
- **Mix Net Security Models**: A comprehensive definition of security for mix nets in the voting context is needed. This model must be natural and inspire confidence. Non-malleable encryption is crucial to prevent subtle privacy violations.
- **Human Interaction in Protocols**: Voting protocols require human participants to follow complex steps. Voter education and foolproof protocol design are necessary to minimize errors and ensure secure use.

#### 6. Conclusion
Neff and Chaum’s goal of developing a coercion-free, privacy-preserving, and voter-verifiable election system is commendable. Their systems offer significant security improvements over current DRE-based paperless systems. However, the underspecification at the systems and human interaction levels reveals potential weaknesses. A well-designed implementation and deployment can mitigate these weaknesses. Despite the challenges, the future prospects for these voting systems are promising.
