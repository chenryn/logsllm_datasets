As a newcomer to Flutter, I find this layout hard to skim:

My eyes go immediately to the center pane. I expect to see a heading that says
`Listener` at the very top of the center pane; like **Layout behavior** , but
perhaps with a more prominent treatment to show it's the subject of the page.
I realize that " **Listener** " appears in both the top and right frames, but
that's not where my eyes naturally look - the current layout looks broken. I
wonder how the docs page could be redesigned to make **class Listener** more
prominent and/or to add a heading identifying the class to the center pane.
