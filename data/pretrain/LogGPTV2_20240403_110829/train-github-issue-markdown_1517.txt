As a newcomer to Flutter, I find the current layout challenging to navigate. Here is my observation and suggestion for improvement:

Upon first glance, my attention is immediately drawn to the center pane. I expected to see a prominent heading, such as "Listener," at the top of this section, similar to the **Layout behavior** heading but with a more distinct style to indicate that it is the main subject of the page.

Although "Listener" is mentioned in both the top and right frames, these are not the areas where my eyes naturally focus. As a result, the current layout appears disjointed. 

To improve the documentation page, I suggest making the **class Listener** more prominent, or adding a clear heading in the center pane to identify the class. This would make the page more intuitive and user-friendly for newcomers like myself.
