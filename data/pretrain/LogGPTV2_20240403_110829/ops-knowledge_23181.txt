Question: In the context of mobile application security, why might using complex data types like Swift's String for processing sensitive information be problematic regarding memory management?
"A": "Complex data types like Swift's String are too inefficient for mobile applications, leading to performance issues.",
"B": "These complex data types can create multiple hidden copies in memory, which cannot be directly accessed for secure erasure.",
"C": "The use of complex data types like Swift's String is always secure as they are designed with built-in encryption.",
"D": "Memory management issues with complex data types are a myth; modern programming languages automatically handle security."
Answer: B
