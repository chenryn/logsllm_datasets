title:blackhat:eu-21 ReCertifying Active Directory Certificate Services
Microsoft's Active Directory Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementation, known as Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), has unfortunately flown under the radar of the defensive industry. AD CS is widely deployed and provides attackers opportunities for credential theft, machine persistence, domain escalation, and subtle domain persistence. We present relevant background on certificates in Active Directory, briefly overview the attacks possible, and present preventive, detective, and indecent response guidance for how to secure organizations against these abuses. By presenting the most comprehensive guidance on securing AD CS we hope to give organizations the information and tools they need to secure these complex, widely deployed, and often misunderstood systems.
