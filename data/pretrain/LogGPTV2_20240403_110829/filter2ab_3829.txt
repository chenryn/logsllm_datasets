### Title: Re-Certifying Active Directory Certificate Services at Black Hat EU 2021

Microsoft's Active Directory Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), known as Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS), has often been overlooked by the cybersecurity community. AD CS is widely deployed and, if not properly secured, can provide attackers with opportunities for credential theft, machine persistence, domain escalation, and subtle domain persistence.

In this presentation, we will cover the essential background on certificates in Active Directory, provide a brief overview of potential attacks, and offer comprehensive guidance on preventive, detective, and incident response measures to secure organizations against these threats. Our goal is to equip organizations with the information and tools they need to protect these complex, widely deployed, and often misunderstood systems.

By providing the most thorough guidance on securing AD CS, we aim to help organizations better understand and mitigate the risks associated with this critical infrastructure.
