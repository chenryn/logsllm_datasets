Several of the types in the Iterators package are widely useful, plus have
very small implementations that perform well. I would say these are: Count,
Take, Drop, Cycle, Repeat, and RepeatForever. It would make sense to have
these in Base.
Also, iterators are afflicted by a mild case of "lettercase hell". We export
both `Enumerate` and `enumerate`, etc. I would prefer to minimize the number
of exported things that differ only in case. There are a few ways to deal with
this:
  1. Remove the lowercase versions entirely, and stick with the "uppercase means lazy" convention.
  2. Rename the uppercase versions to something less appealing like `EnumerateIterator` so they are less easily confused.
  3. Un-export (and possibly rename as well) the uppercase versions.
