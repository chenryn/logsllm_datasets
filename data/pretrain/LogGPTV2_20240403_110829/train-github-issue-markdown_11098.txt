I noticed `next build` started to take quite some time, so long in fact that
it started to fail with an exit code 137 when I deploy to `now`. It turns out
`__tests__` directories within `pages/` caused it. Once I deleted them, which
includes Jest snapshot files, `next build` took about a minute and worked fine
when deploying to `now`.
My apologies if this has been discussed already, but I couldn't find anything
on Github or in Slack. Is this a known issue? Do others have their test files
within `pages/`?
