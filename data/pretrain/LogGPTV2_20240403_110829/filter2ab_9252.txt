### Title: Government-Mandated Front Doors? A Global Assessment of Legalized Government Access to Data

**Abstract:**

In an era where digital security and data privacy are paramount, the concept of "front door" access to data—where governments require private companies to provide data in exchange for market access—has gained significant attention. This issue affects a wide range of industries, from tech giants like Tesla to smaller enterprises, and raises critical questions about the protection of intellectual property and personal data.

As digital authoritarianism spreads, the risks associated with government-mandated data access have become more pronounced. Simultaneously, global supply chain disruptions have prompted many companies to reassess their international operations, with cybersecurity emerging as a top priority. As corporations consider reshoring and transforming their global footprints, it is essential to integrate government data access policies into their strategic planning.

To better understand these policies and their implications, this presentation introduces a new global index that evaluates countries based on their government-mandated data access requirements. The index will be used to compare and contrast different regulatory frameworks, examining whether the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the Chinese model is more influential in shaping global data access policies.

We will delve into the data and factors driving the index, and we will also seek community input to refine and improve the model. Given the ongoing global transformations, understanding the landscape of government-mandated data access is crucial for navigating the full spectrum of cyber risks.

**Key Points:**

1. **Front Door vs. Backdoor Access:**
   - The shift from backdoor to front door access, where governments legally mandate data provision.
   - Examples of companies affected, including Tesla and U.S. tech giants.

2. **Risks and Implications:**
   - Threats to intellectual property and personal data.
   - The rise of digital authoritarianism and its impact on data security.

3. **Global Supply Chain Disruptions:**
   - How recent disruptions have led to a reevaluation of global operations.
   - The importance of cybersecurity in decision-making processes.

4. **New Global Index:**
   - Introduction of a global index to assess government-mandated data access requirements.
   - Comparison of GDPR and the Chinese model.
   - Factors and data driving the index.

5. **Community Engagement:**
   - Soliciting feedback and recommendations from the community to enhance the model.
   - The role of the index in informing corporate and policy decisions.

By addressing these key points, this presentation aims to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the global landscape of government-mandated data access, equipping stakeholders with the knowledge needed to navigate the complex and evolving world of cyber risks.
