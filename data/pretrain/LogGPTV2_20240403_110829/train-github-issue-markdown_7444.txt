Currently, the IAM Policy template for Kubernetes master grants `ec2:*`
permissions, which means the role have the API access to potentially terminate
other instances even if they are not in the Kubernetes cluster.
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": ["ec2:*"],
          "Resource": ["*"]
        },

master-policy.json#L6
A suggestion is to instead whitelist the actions required for Kubernetes
Master. A list to start with would be:
`ec2:Describe*` to get ec2 instance metadata such as AZ information.  
`ec2:AttachVolume`, `ec2:DetachVolume` to support EBS mounting.
