The results of the top 50 apps, with respect to log numbers, and
detailed statistics of the top 5 apps are shown in Fig. 18 and Table 7,
respectively. From Fig. 18 and Table 7, we can see that the top apps
generated 4,974,027 ad bid requests, and 1,925,669 requests were
invalid; the top 5 apps all together generated more than 200,000
requests. We further studied FLR and FDR, as shown in Fig. 19. We
can see that 14 out of the top 50 apps exhibited high FLR (>50%),
wherein 6 apps had an FDR higher than 30%. This indicates that
a relatively small number of fraudulent devices generate a larger
number of ad requests.

and fraudulent device ratios (FDR) of the top 50 apps.
Then we use these devices as the training dataset and then train
the device classier. The classier achieves 80.7% accuracy, 78.5%
precision, and 86.1% recall in the 2018 dataset. To study the top
apps sending the largest number of ad bid requests, we use 300,000
random sampled Android devices in the 2018 dataset, predict them
with EH, and extract the bundle IDs contained in their
logs. We then calculate the number of logs for each app, as well as
the number of fraudulent logs, i.e., logs generated by fraudulent
devices. We dene the following metrics (Eqns. 4–6), including a
fraudulent device ratio (FDR), a fraudulent log ratio (FLR, identical

ulent log ratio (invalid trac ratio); FDR is the fraudulent device ratio; AFD is the app fraud degree (dened in Appendix C).
The results are derived from EH. The daily loss is the estimation based on the average eCPM value ($2). # 19, # 22,
and # 48 are iOS apps with unknown numbers of downloads. # 49 is unavailable in any market.
