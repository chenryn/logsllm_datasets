### Title: Black Hat EU-19: HTTP Desync Attacks - Request Smuggling Reborn

**Abstract:**

HTTP requests are traditionally considered as isolated, standalone entities. In this session, I will introduce techniques that remote, unauthenticated attackers can use to break through this isolation and splice their requests into others. Using these methods, I was able to manipulate the web infrastructure of numerous commercial and military systems, deliver exploits to their visitors, and earn over $70,000 in bug bounties.

**Key Topics:**

1. **Request Splicing Techniques:**
   - Learn how to delicately modify victims' requests to route them into malicious territory.
   - Discover methods to invoke harmful responses and lure credentials into your control.

2. **Backend Reassembly Exploitation:**
   - Explore how to exploit backend reassembly on your own requests to leverage the trust placed on the frontend.
   - Gain maximum privilege access to internal APIs, poison web caches, and compromise critical pages like PayPal's login page.

3. **Historical Context and Evolution:**
   - Understand the history of HTTP Request Smuggling, first documented in 2005, and its resurgence due to increased web vulnerabilities.
   - Examine new attack variants and exploitation vectors that have emerged.

4. **Custom Tooling and Methodology:**
   - Utilize custom open-source tools and a refined methodology for reliable black-box detection, assessment, and exploitation.
   - Minimize the risk of collateral damage during your assessments.

5. **Recent Developments:**
   - Review significant developments and advancements in the field since the initial presentation at Black Hat USA earlier this year.

By the end of this session, you will have a comprehensive understanding of HTTP desync attacks and the practical skills to detect, assess, and exploit these vulnerabilities with minimal risk.
