When using Atom to comment out HTML `<script>` tags with JavaScript comments, the process can sometimes lead to unexpected results. Below is an example of what happens when you attempt to toggle comments in Atom:

### Example Code:
1. **Initial Code:**
   ```html
   <script>
       console.log("This is a script tag.");
   </script>
   ```

2. **First Toggle Comment (Edit > Toggle Comments / Ctrl+/):**
   ```html
   // <script>
   //     console.log("This is a script tag.");
   // </script>
   ```

3. **Second Toggle Comment (Edit > Toggle Comments / Ctrl+/):**
   ```html
   <script>
       console.log("This is a script tag.");
   </script>
   ```

### Explanation:
- **First Toggle:** When you first use the "Toggle Comments" feature, Atom wraps the entire `<script>` block with `//` comments. This effectively comments out the entire script block.
- **Second Toggle:** When you toggle the comments again, Atom removes the `//` comments, restoring the original code.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax highlighting and language mode are set correctly in Atom to avoid any unintended behavior.
- If you need to comment out only part of the JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags, you may need to do so manually or use a more specific commenting approach.

By following these steps, you can better understand how Atom handles commenting in HTML `<script>` tags.
