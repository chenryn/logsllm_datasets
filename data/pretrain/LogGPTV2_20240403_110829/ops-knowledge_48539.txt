Question: In the context of IP routing using BGP, why would relying solely on higher layer defenses be an insufficient strategy to protect against malicious activity by local networks?
"A": "Higher layer defenses can prevent misrouting but do not protect against traffic analysis.",
"B": "BGP operates at layer 3 and therefore is unaffected by defenses implemented at higher layers.",
"C": "Malicious local networks could still read and potentially modify messages in transit, despite higher layer defenses.",
"D": "BGP is designed to be self-securing and does not require additional defenses."
Answer: C
