### 3.1 Is Historical Data Useful?

We aimed to determine the value of maintaining historical DNS records beyond their Time-To-Live (TTL) values. To achieve this, we simulated an extreme attack scenario where all DNS nameservers are non-operational. In such a situation, resolvers must rely on a stale cache to answer queries that cannot be resolved using the current resolver cache. It is important to note that this scenario does not represent a realistic flooding attack; rather, it serves as an extreme test case to evaluate the utility of retaining stale DNS information.

#### Simulation and Results

We conducted simulations with varying attack durations and different stale cache sizes. Our focus was on queries that could not be answered based on the resolver's current cache. Figure 3 illustrates the fraction of these queries that can be answered using the stale cache.

- A 1-day stale cache can answer 68% of the queries during a 3-hour attack.
- Increasing the stale cache size to 3 days improves the answer rate to 73.7%.
- A 14-day stale cache further increases the answer rate to 79.6%.

However, beyond 14 days, the benefits of increasing the stale cache size diminish:
- A 21-day stale cache answers 80.7% of the queries.
- A 30-day stale cache answers 81.5% of the queries.

These diminishing returns can be attributed to the Zipf distribution of DNS name popularity, as observed in previous studies [11].

#### Query Answer Rate and Accuracy

Figure 5 shows the fraction of queries answered and the accuracy of the responses for both NS-queries and A-queries during a 3-hour attack. The X-axis in the figures is limited to specific stale cache sizes for clarity.

- For NS-queries, a 1-day stale cache answers 68% of the queries, while a 30-day stale cache answers 99.5%.
- For A-queries, the accuracy remains consistently high, with a 1-day stale cache providing 99.8% accurate records and a 30-day stale cache providing 99.4% accurate records.

Overall, these results indicate that even in an extreme attack scenario, a stale cache can significantly and accurately answer a large fraction of client queries.

### 3.2 Performance Under Different Attack Scenarios

We evaluated the performance of the stale cache under three different attack scenarios:

1. **Root Server Unavailability:**
   - In this scenario, root servers are inaccessible to clients. Normally, this would cause queries for NS records corresponding to top-level domains (TLDs) to fail. However, in our trace-based simulation, all such queries succeeded because the NS records for all TLDs were present in either the current cache or the stale cache at all times. Thus, the stale cache ensured that all TLD-related queries were successfully answered.

2. **Other Attack Scenarios:**
   - We also considered other attack scenarios to further validate the effectiveness of the stale cache. The results from these scenarios will be discussed in the following sections.

The detailed results and analysis for these scenarios are provided in the subsequent sections.
