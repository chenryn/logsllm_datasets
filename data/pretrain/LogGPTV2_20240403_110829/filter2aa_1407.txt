Goal: 
Build a low cost underwater glider
“If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you 
must first create the universe.” - Carl Sagan
What is an underwater 
glider?
Underwater Gliders:
-Highly efficient autonomous submarines 
that can travel long distances on battery 
power

How do you make an Underwater 
Glider?
Design Spiral: 
1. Define Requirements
2. Research
3. Buoyancy engine
4. Energy Storage
5. Attitude Control System
6. Hull Design
7. Testing
Efficiency crucial elements of an 
Underwater Glider
-Low Drag Hull Form
-Buoyancy Engine
Conservative:Torpedo(Myring 1976)
Bold:Laminar Flow X-35(Carmichael 1966)
Define Requirements:
1. Low Price($100 Target)
2. Difficulty of manufacture(In my boxers)
3. Range/Efficiency(Fingers crossed)
Early Efforts During Learning Phase
-Axial Piston Syringe Pump
Research
(Considered a variety of approaches)
● High Test Peroxide
● Free Piston Diesel
● Hydraulic Pumps
● Electric Motors
● Linear Actuators
● Wave Power/Solar
Buoyancy Engine
-Phase Change Material("PCM")
-Not N-Pentadecane(~10 degree C melting point)
-Canning wax:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraffin_wax
" In chemistry,paraffin is used synonymously with "alkane", indicating hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2" --
Expands ~8-12 percent at Phase Change
--Melting Point ~60 degree C(varies with 
composition)
Energy Storage
● Lithium CSC Chemistry: 
○ ~549Wh/kg 
○ ~1170Wh/L

● Manganese Dioxide Lithium Coin Cell: 
○ 3V @ ~265mAh CR2330
○ 209Wh/kg

● Zinc Air Chemistry: 
○ ~367.5 Wh/kg
○ ~1300 Wh/L!
● High Test Peroxide (HTP): 
○ ~ 813 Wh/kg

Fiberglass was not as easy as it 
looked on Youtube!

Benefits of 3D printing
-Reduced engineering burden to purchase and 
evaluate CoTs components
-With commercial services on the market, the 
criteria for low barriers to entry are met
-Design rules similar to Plastic Injection 
Molding
Obstacles:
-With no simulation, test data was expensive to 
generate
-With no firm targets or test data, it was difficult 
to quantify design improvements or identify a 
finished product
Influence of "Out of pocket" on R&D:
Pros:
-no reporting requirements, outside influences 
on project direction, or accountability.
Cons
-Very small funding agency
-Dubious appropriation of retirement savings
-Free labor(opportunity cost) vs. buying CoTs 
solutions
-Test Max Depth & Velocity
-Trim Vehicle 
Buoyancy = 3M Microballoons 
Ballast = Salt
-Solid Models, BoM, & Source Code on DVD
