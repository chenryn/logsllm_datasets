How does the FTC respond to 
the Rise of the Machines? 
When 
machines are 
everywhere? 
What does the FTC do? 
Unfair 
Deceptive 
What do “unfair” and “deceptive” mean? 
• Unfair =  
– Substantial Injury to Consumers  
– Unavoidable 
– Not Outweighed Procompetitive By 
Benefits 
• Deceptive =  
– Act Likely to Mislead Consumers 
– Unreasonable 
– Material      
For Example …  
Facebook promised to keep personal 
info safe, but allowed 3rd party access 
Snapchat promised images would 
disappear, but kept them 
Wyndham unfairly exposed consumers’ 
payment-card info in three separate 
data breaches 
For Example …  
Google promised Gmail contacts 
wouldn’t be used elsewhere, but used 
them in its social-media site, Buzz 
ASUS promised its routers would 
protect local network against attacks, 
but failed to update them enough 
ORACLE promised its updates would 
protect consumers, but didn’t protect 
older versions of Java SE.

Research Wish List:  
What is the FTC looking for? 
We want… 
… Research On Privacy and Security 
• What value do consumers put on various 
aspects of privacy in different contexts? 
• How can we assess the risk of harm from 
security and privacy breaches? 
• How can we trace the illegal sale of identity info 
back to a particular breach? 
• How can interventions make attacks less 
economically viable? 
• What does the FTC need to know to protect 
consumers from ransomware, malvertising, etc? 
… Research to Enhance Fraud Detection 
• How are fraud and attacker ecosystems 
organized? Participants? Tools? 
Incentives? 
• How can we detect fraudulent ads and 
online posts? 
• What practices, communications, 
methods are signs of fraudulent 
activity? 
… New Tools for Privacy and Security 
• Allow users to control personal info 
• Filter or block unwanted marketing calls 
and scams on all types of phone lines 
• Prevent or detect callerID spoofing 
…New Tools for Investigation & Enforcement 
• Analyze apps to determine practices associated with 
third-party libraries 
• Detect discriminatory algorithms 
• Identify when tracking is occurring and what info is 
being collected 
• Identify cross-device tracking 
• Identify vulnerable IoT devices 
• Analyze law enforcement complaint databases, 
social network data, etc. to detect emerging scams 
….Research On Emerging Technologies & 
Trends

Connected Devices and Cloud Services 
– What do consumers understand about “buying” cloud services? 
– What do consumers understand about security issues when 
devices are no longer supported and updated? 
– Do firms have adequate plans to inform consumers about the 
lifecycle of connected products? 
•
Virtual Reality 
– What are security and privacy impacts of VR? 
– Does VR raise new consumer protection concerns? 
•
Intelligent machines
