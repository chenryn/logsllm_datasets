from the car to the key as such operation requires a large
amount of energy.
In backup mode, e.g., when the battery is exhausted, the
user is still able to open and start his car. The manufacturers
usually embed a backup physical key within the key fob to
open the car doors. These are shown in Figure 2(a). In or-
der to start the engine the system uses the passive LF RFID
capabilities of the key. Given the very short communication
range as discussed before, the user is required to place the
key in the close proximity of some predeﬁned location in
the car (e.g., the car Start button). We discuss the security
implications of that mode of operation in Section 6.
3 Relay Attack on Smart Key Systems
In this section we ﬁrst describe generic relay attacks, and
then we present the attacks that we implemented and tested
on PKES systems of several cars from different manufactur-
ers. In our experiments, we relayed the LF communication
between the car and the key; the relay of the UHF commu-
nication (from the key to the car) was not needed since this
communication is ’long’ range (approx. 100 m) and is not
used in PKES systems for proximity detection. However,
similar relay attacks could also be mounted on UHF com-
munication if a longer relay than 100 m would be required.
3.1 Relay Attacks
The relay attack is a well known attack against commu-
nication systems [24]. In a basic relay attack, messages are
relayed from one location to another in order to make one
entity appear closer to the other. Examples of relay attacks
have been shown on credit card transactions [18] and be-
tween nodes in wireless sensor networks, known as a worm-
hole attack [25]. An example of relay attack on RFID 3 has
been shown in [22]. The attack consists of ﬁrst demodu-
lating the signal, transmitting it as digital information using
RF and then modulating it near the victim tag. In this ex-
perimental setup, the relay adds 15 to 20 μseconds of delay.
This delay would be detected by a suitable key/car pair as
the delay of signal propagation is in the order of nanosec-
onds for a short distance.
In this work, we design and implement a physical-layer
relay attack. Our attack does not need to interpret, nor to
modify the signal, i.e., only introduces the delays typical for
analog RF components. It is completely transparent to most
security protocols designed to provide authentication or se-
crecy of the messages. Although some attacks have been
reported on key entry systems [26, 34, 13, 8], our attack is
independent of those. Even if a PKES system uses strong
cryptography (e.g., AES, RSA), it would still be vulnerable
3Although for a different RFID technology (ISO 14443 / 13.56 MHz).

to our proposed relay attack.
It should be noted that many relay attacks previously
presented are modulating and demodulating the signal, in
other words they often rely on a fake reader and RFID
tag. An obvious advantage of such attacks is that they can
be performed with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hard-
ware. The same setup can also be used to perform replay or
message forging. However, this approach has several draw-
backs. First, modulation and demodulation signiﬁcantly in-
crease the response time of the attack; this extra time could
be detected and used as a proof of the presence of a relay.
Second, such a realization is dependent on the modulation
and encoding of the signal, which makes the relay speciﬁc
to some key model. Both drawbacks are avoided in our de-
sign and implementation of the relay attack.
3.2 Relay Over-Cable Attack
In order to perform this attack, we used a relay (Figure 3)
composed of two loop antennas connected together with a
cable that relays the LF signal between those two antennas.
An optional ampliﬁer can be placed in the middle to im-
prove the signal power. When the loop antenna is presented
close to the door handle, it captures the car beacon signal
as a local magnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁeld excites the ﬁrst antenna
of the relay, which creates by induction an alternating sig-
nal at the output of the antenna. This electric signal is then
transmitted over the coaxial cable and reaches the second
antenna via an optional ampliﬁer. The need for an ampli-
ﬁer depends on several parameters such as the quality of the
antennas, the length of the cable, the strength of the orig-
inal signal and the proximity of the relaying antenna from
the car’s antenna. When the relayed signal reaches the sec-
ond antenna of the cable it creates a current in the antenna
which in turn generates a magnetic ﬁeld in the proximity
of the second antenna. Finally, this magnetic ﬁeld excites
the antenna of the key which demodulates this signal and
recovers the original message from the car. In all the Pas-
sive Keyless Entry and Start systems we evaluated, this is
sufﬁcient to make the key sending the open or the start au-
thorization message over the UHF channel. The message
sent by the key will depend on what was originally sent by
the car. The car will send open command to the key from
the outside antennas and the start command form the inside
antennas. Therefore, the attacker (e.g., car thief) ﬁrst needs
to present the relaying antenna in front of the door handle
such that the key will send the open signal. Once the door is
unlocked, the attacker brings the relaying antenna inside the
car and after he pushes the brakes pedal or the start engine
button the car will send the start message to the key. In both
cases the key answers on UHF and the action (open or start)
is performed.
3.3 Relay Over-The-Air Attack
Relaying over a cable might be inconvenient or raise sus-
picion. For example, the presence of walls or doors could
prevent it. We therefore design and realize a physical layer
relay attack over the air. Our attack relays the LF signals
from the car over a purpose-built RF link with minimal de-
lays. The link is composed of two parts, the emitter and
the receiver. The emitter captures the LF signal and up-
converts it to 2.5 GHz. The obtained 2.5 GHz signal is then
ampliﬁed and transmitted over the air. The receiver part
of the link receives this signal and down-converts it to ob-
tain the original LF signal. This LF signal is then ampliﬁed
again and sent to a loop LF antenna which reproduces the
signal that was emitted by the car in its integrity. The proce-
dure for opening and starting the engine of the car remains
the same as discussed above.
Using the concept of analog up and down conversion al-
lows the attacker to reach larger relay distances, while at the
same time it keeps the size, power consumption and price of
the attack very low (see Section 3.4) 4.
4It could be possible to transmit in LF over a large distance. However
this would require large antennas and a signiﬁcant amount of power [17].

50K$) cars, 1 minivan and 2 cars in the compact class
(<30K$). We had two different models for only two of the
tested manufacturers. During the evaluation of the 10 dif-
ferent PKES systems, we observed that all of them differ in
their implementation. We also noticed that even if they rely
on the same general idea and similar chips the overall sys-
tem behaves differently for each model 7. The differences
were found in timings (as shown below), modulation and
protocol details (e.g., number of exchanged messages, mes-
sage length). Only the aftermarket system was obviously
not using any secure authentication mechanisms.
When possible, on each car we measured the distances
for the relay, the maximum acceptable delay and the key
response time and spread.
4.1 Distance Measurements
In order to validate the feasibility of the attack in prac-
tice, we tested several distances for the cable relay. This
allows to evaluate the possible attack setup, a longer relay
distance over the cable will allow the thief to act when the
car owner is relatively far from his car, reducing chances of
detection. We further measured the distance form the re-
laying antenna to the key, a longer distance will make the
attack easier (e.g., avoid suspicion from the user).
The cable relay was performed with off-the-shelf coaxial
cables. We built two 30 m cables that we combined for the
60 m relay tests. We used a set of antennas, two small sim-
ple home made antennas, and a large antenna 8 for an im-
proved antenna-key range. We performed the attacks with
these antennas both with and without ampliﬁcation. If the
LF signal near the car was weak we used a 10 mW low-
noise ampliﬁer to increase the signal level. To further im-
prove key to antenna range we used a power ampliﬁer with
a nominal power of 2 to 5 W.
The results of those experiments are shown in Table 4.
The relays over the 3 cable lengths were always successful
when we were able to test them. Furthermore, only in few
cases we had to use an ampliﬁer, in most of the cases the sig-
nal received on the collecting antenna was strong enough to
perform the relay over the cable without any ampliﬁcation.
However, without ampliﬁcation at the key-side relay an-
tenna, the key could only be excited from a few centime-
ters up to 2 m. With a power ampliﬁer, we were able to
