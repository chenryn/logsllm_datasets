Fig. 4. Top 10 content categories of sites using (i) SWs (blue) and (ii) SWs that
communicate with advertisers (red). As we can see, SWs is a technique widely used in
sites delivering content related to ‘News and Media’ and ‘Computers Electronics and
Technology’. (Color ﬁgure online)
minutes, during which, and according to our experiments, is suﬃcient for a SW
to be register and make the ﬁrst touch with the corresponding server(s) (1st
crawl). After 5 months (April 2021), we revisit the websites of our initial Tranco
list to inspect how the ecosystem evolved, i.e., sites dropping SWs, new sites
adopting SWs (2nd crawl). Table 1 summarizes the data collected.
Data Analysis. To classify the network traﬃc of the registered SWs in our data,
we use the 1Host ﬁlterlist [16] and ﬂag the ad-related domains in our weblogs.
Additionally, we used SimilarWeb [17] to categorize the sites registering SW
based on the content they deliver.
Historical Analysis and Static Detection. To explore the evolution of SWs
across time, we use our set of SW -registering sites to extract heuristics and
keywords that indicate the registration or use of SWs. This way, we develop a
crawler that can statically detect the registration of SWs in this set of sites. Next,
we use Wayback Machine [18], and speciﬁcally waybackpy Python package [19]
to go back in time and ﬁnd the day that these websites started deploying SWs
in their visitors’ browsers.
Ethical Considerations. It is important to note that during the conduct of
this study, we neither gathered or used any user data, nor impeded or tampered
with the proper operation of the sites we crawled, in any way. Our research was
purely limited in passively monitoring the behavior of SWs.
